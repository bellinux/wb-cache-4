5|$|After {{returning}} from overseas in 1921, Cooper {{got a job}} working <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> at The New York Times. He was commissioned to write articles for Asia magazine. Cooper was able to travel with Ernest Schoedsack on a sea voyage on the Wisdom II. As part of the journey, he traveled to Abyssinia, or the Ethiopian Empire, where he met their prince regent, Ras Tefari, later known as Emperor Haile Selassie I. The ship left Abyssinia in February 1923. On their way home, the crew narrowly missed being attacked by pirates, and the ship was burned down. His three-part series for Asia was published in 1923.|$|E

5|$|A pair {{will work}} {{together}} to help build the nest, incubate the eggs and raise their altricial young. However, in most species the male {{does most of the}} nest excavation and takes <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> while incubating the eggs. A clutch will usually consist of two to five round white eggs. Since these birds are cavity nesters, their eggs {{do not need to be}} camouflaged and the white color helps the parents to see them in dim light. The eggs are incubated for about 11–14 days before they hatch. It then takes about 18–30 days before the chicks are fully fledged and ready to leave the nest. In most species, soon after this the young are left to fend for themselves, exceptions being the various social species, and the Hispaniolan woodpecker, where adults continue to feed their young for several months. In general, cavity nesting is a successful strategy and a higher proportion of young are reared than is the case with birds that nest in the open. In Africa, several species of honeyguide are brood parasites of woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} an unknown person {{lighting}} a candle in the homicide squadroom. One by one, the detectives arrive for <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> on an unusually hot September evening. A furious Gee (Yaphet Kotto) calls maintenance {{to complain about the}} non-working air conditioner and learns it has been shut off for the night. Felton (Daniel Baldwin) and Lewis (Clark Johnson) try to find out who secretly lights the candle every night; they blow it out a number of times, but it always ends up lit again without anyone noticing. Munch (Richard Belzer) loudly complains about his ex-girlfriend breaking up with him. While the other detectives sweat and complain about the heat, a calm and comfortable Pembleton (Andre Braugher) wears a tie and drinks hot tea without sweating. Bayliss (Kyle Secor), who acts uncooperative with his partner Pembleton, says he has found the fingerprints of a man named James Hill who he believes is the murderer in the Adena Watson case. Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) brings in Hill, who {{turns out to be a}} 12-year-old boy (Kenny Blank), much to the amusement of the other detectives.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] The {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to examine the effects of}} age on sleep and the circadian rhythms during consecutive <b>night</b> <b>shifts.</b> METHODS [...] Two groups of letter sorters (19 - 29 (n = 7) and 53 - 59 (n = 7) years of age were studied in a sleep laboratory under closely controlled conditions. After two baseline days, circadian adjustment to three <b>night</b> <b>shifts</b> was monitored by continuous measurement of rectal temperature, salivary melatonin, and sleep-wakefulness during <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>shifts.</b> RESULTS [...] Age was significantly related to <b>the</b> adjustment to <b>night</b> work of rectal temperature minimum and of self rated sleepiness. Young subjects delayed their temperature phase and decreased sleepiness more than the older subjects. Age was also significantly related to an increase of alertness and to the feeling of being refreshed after the day sleep. Although there were basic differences in sleep duration and structure between the age groups, the latter did not change across <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>shifts.</b> CONCLUSION [...] Aging decreases the ability to recover after several, but not after <b>the</b> first <b>night</b> <b>shift...</b>|$|R

25|$|Shift work: nurses {{working on}} morning shifts with very early {{awakening}} (between 4:00–5:30a.m.) {{had a greater}} and prolonged cortisol awakening response than those on the late day shift (between 6:00–9:00a.m.) or <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> (between 11:00a.m.–2:00p.m.).

Another unique episode from this season explained through flashbacks how Furillo and Davenport met and fell in love.

Eventually, the latter pre-occupation cost him his job. One night in 1867, he was working with a lead–acid battery when he spilled sulfuric acid onto the floor. It ran between the floorboards and onto his boss's desk below. The next morning Edison was fired.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Various {{combinations}} of interventions {{were used to}} phase-delay circa-dian rhythms to correct their misalignment with night work and day sleep. Young participants (median age = 22, n = 67) participated in 5 consecutive simu-lated <b>night</b> <b>shifts</b> (2300 to 0700) and then slept at home (0830 to 1530) in darkened bedrooms. Participants wore sunglasses with normal or dark lenses (transmis-sion 15 % or 2 %) when outside during the day. Participants took placebo or melatonin (1. 8 mg sustained release) before daytime sleep. During <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>shifts,</b> participants were exposed to a moving (delaying) pattern of intermittent bright light (~ 5000 lux, 20 min on, 40 min off, 4 - 5 light pulses/night) or remained in dim light (~ 150 lux). There were 6 intervention groups ranging from the least complex (normal sunglasses) to the most complex (dark sunglasses + bright light + melatonin). The dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) was assessed before and after <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>shifts</b> (baseline and final), and 7 h was added to estimate the tem-perature minimum (Tmin). Participants were categorized by their amount of re-entrainment based on their final Tmin: not re-entrained (Tmin before the day...|$|R
25|$|Subsequent {{research}} highlights {{a gradual}} deterioration of safety practices {{in regard to}} the MIC, which had become less relevant to plant operations. By 1984, only six of the original twelve operators were still working with MIC and the number of supervisory personnel had also been halved. No maintenance supervisor was placed on <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> and instrument readings were taken every two hours, rather than the previous and required one-hour readings. Workers made complaints about the cuts through their union but were ignored. One employee was fired after going on a 15-day hunger strike. 70% of the plant's employees were fined before the disaster for refusing to deviate from the proper safety regulations under pressure from the management.|$|E
25|$|Allen Moore, WAPE's news director, {{was also}} a bodybuilder. Tracht {{questioned}} Moore about his hobby, and Moore encouraged Tracht to try it. Tracht began a high protein diet of canned tuna, raw eggs, and milk; took vitamins; and lifted weights for 90 minutes a day. In the first three months, he added 25 pounds of muscle to his thin physique. After a year, he had gained 45 pounds, and people commented that he looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Tracht enrolled in an evening law enforcement training program, and after completing it, he volunteered as an auxiliary officer. He occasionally worked <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> with the Clay County Sheriff's Office, then {{went directly to the}} station at 5:30a.m. for his morning show, still in uniform.|$|E
