40|$|Growth {{data were}} {{collected}} from from 40 European aspen (Populus tremula L.) stands growing on eight localities in Sweden. The stands ranged in latitude from 56 to 66 °N. The mean age of the stands was 32 years (range, 12 – 63), the mean stand density 1978 stems ha– 1 (range, 300 – 6000), and the mean diameter at breast height (on bark) 17 cm (range, 8 – 34). Site index curves were constructed for total age. Curves for H 40 (dominant height at 40 years total age) were made for <b>total</b> <b>Sweden.</b> Curves fitted for H 40 total age have another shape than curves presented by other Nordic studies. The curves from the present study have slower growth for young aspens than curves from norwegian and finnish conditions. For 50 – 70 -year-old aspen stands, curves from the present study indicate taller heights than from Nordic studies. Classified soil types from the stands were grouped into three groups: sandy till (17), light clay (15) and medium clay till (4). As there was only one stand growing in the fine sand group and one stand in the heavy clay till group and two stands in the silty till group, these stands were not presented with growth curves. There were no statistically significant differences in site index between the three soil type groups. Some recommendations for management of aspen stand are given. Damages caused by moose, fungis and other injuries are discussed as a problem for height yield production and a good timber quality...|$|E

5|$|Strict secrecy {{surrounded}} the fortress {{for a very}} long time, and there were several attempts made by foreign powers to gain knowledge of various kinds of information.

50|$|Recent years’ large balance-of-payments {{surplus in}} Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden {{has reduced the}} countries’ foreign debt. In {{addition}} to a balance-of-payments surplus or deficit, {{the size of a}} country’s foreign debt and foreign assets is affected by the exchange rate and the price of securities. Consequently, Finland’s foreign debt increased noticeably when the price of technology shares increased drastically in the late 1990s due to a large proportion of these shares being owned by households, funds and companies abroad. In this way, these foreign owners held a greater claim on Finland. When share prices decreased drastically in 1999-2001 in the dot-com bubble, it also led to a marked decrease in Finland’s net foreign debt. Iceland’s foreign net debt accounts for close to five times of its GDP. This means that Iceland owes the surrounding world values corresponding to five times the country’s <b>total</b> production. <b>Sweden</b> also had foreign debts by the end of 2010, however, at a much smaller scale. In 2012, all Nordic countries had a surplus on the total balance of payments. Norway accounts for a substantial foreign exchange surplus, which is due to revenue from exports of oil and gas.|$|R

40|$|Report of diploma work {{conducted}} at the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority (SSM) {{as part of the}} bachelors program in Nuclear Engineering at Uppsala University. All nuclear power plants in Sweden are obliged to report any deficiency in their barriers or the defense in depth in obedience to SSM’s regulations concerning safety in nuclear facilities. In addition, there is an international system for reporting such events. The purpose of this thesis is to study the Swedish report system and to analyze the differences between Swedish and international event reporting. In the Swedish system, SSM’s regulations are effectuated by means of event reports classified as category 1 - 3, designed individually at each Swedish facility. Accordingly, the reporting differs somewhat between facilities. The number of reports in the Swedish system is relatively large, with a frequency of about 400 per year. Internationally, a system called the International Reporting System for Operating Experience (IRS) has been developed, through which the participating countries exchange experience to improve the safety of nuclear power plants. The IRS reporting frequency is about 100 per year in <b>total,</b> and <b>Sweden</b> contributes to IRS with 1 - 2 reports per year. This report accounts for a comparison of the two report systems, including some differences and similarities that have been identified. The result shows that the Swedish system covers IRS well but does not have the same comprehensive classification of events and the same standardized format of reporting as the IRS system. The conclusion is that some improvements may be made to the Swedish system, which would facilitate the international exchange of experience at the Swedish nuclear power plants...|$|R
