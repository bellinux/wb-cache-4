2500|$|During a {{transition}} between two other skits on MTV's The State, {{there was a}} brief scene with members of the State dressed as Super Friends. The Flash ran in, informing them of an impending disaster. Superman then began assigning serious tasks to all of the members, finishing by saying [...] "and Aquaman... go <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> fish". The Super Friends then began laughing hysterically, while a visibly embarrassed Aquaman just stood there.|$|E
2500|$|With time, Logroño {{was given}} the chance to do a {{political}} satire show on television station WAPA-TV, which was called [...] "Politiqueando", in 1996. As means to promote the television program, Logroño staged short on-air telephone calls to Salsoul, a Puerto Rican radio station. The early evening disc-jockey, Fernando Arévalo, would <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> of the characters of the show, namely a cat puppet of Logroño's called Polito Garrapatoso, as well as to Don Eleuterio, for no longer than five minutes. Success from these phone calls was such that audiences demanded a longer treatment. Agitando El Show was then born, giving Eleuterio ten, and later twenty minutes of airtime. Eventually the program grew in length, and Don Eleuterio was given a full hour of airtime daily. The program's name, [...] "Agitando", means [...] "Shaking (people up)", as to depict the expected uproar from segments of the audience whenever Don Eleuterio went on the air.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{five days}} after the shootings, 100,000 people {{demonstrated}} in Washington, D.C., against the war and the killing of unarmed student protesters. Ray Price, Nixon's chief speechwriter from 1969 to 1974, recalled the Washington demonstrations saying, [...] "The city was an armed camp. The mobs were smashing windows, slashing tires, dragging parked cars into intersections, even throwing bedsprings off overpasses into the traffic down below. This was the quote, student protest. That's not student protest, that's civil war." [...] Not only was Nixon taken to Camp David for two days for his own protection, but Charles Colson (Counsel to President Nixon from 1969 to 1973) stated that the military was called up to protect the administration from the angry students; he recalled that [...] "The 82nd Airborne was {{in the basement of the}} executive office building, so I went down just to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> of the guys and walk among them, and they're lying on the floor leaning on their packs and their helmets and their cartridge belts and their rifles cocked and you're thinking, 'This can't be the United States of America. This is not the greatest free democracy in the world. This is a nation at war with itself.'" ...|$|E
