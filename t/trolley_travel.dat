5000|$|A {{gantry crane}} has a hoist in a fixed {{machinery}} house or on a trolley that runs horizontally along rails, usually fitted {{on a single}} beam (mono-girder) or two beams (twin-girder). The crane frame is supported on a gantry system with equalized beams and wheels that run on the gantry rail, usually perpendicular to the <b>trolley</b> <b>travel</b> direction. These cranes come in all sizes, and some can move very heavy loads, particularly the extremely large examples used in shipyards or industrial installations. A special version is the container crane (or [...] "Portainer" [...] crane, named by the first manufacturer), designed for loading and unloading ship-borne containers at a port.|$|E

25|$|In San Diego, the San Diego Trolley's Blue Line {{goes from}} the San Ysidro Border Crossing, roughly along Interstate 5 to Downtown and Old Town. As the <b>trolley</b> <b>travels</b> it {{also serves as}} a means of {{transportation}} for the southern suburbs. Passengers may transfer at the 12th & Imperial station to an Orange Line trolley, serving the eastern suburbs. Another option is to transfer at the Old Town Trolley Station to a Green Line trolley serving Mission Valley and the campus of San Diego State University.|$|R
50|$|Shisler Avenue {{station is}} a former SEPTA Route 102 trolley stop in Aldan, Pennsylvania. It is officially located at Woodlawn and Shishler Avenues. Because <b>trolleys</b> <b>travel</b> {{in the middle of}} the street at this stop, there are no sheds or platforms. Parking is not {{available}} and commuters must wait on the sidewalks for trolleys. Shisler Avenue itself is a narrow dead-end street with a western terminus at a neighborhood youth baseball field. At the intersection with Woodlawn Avenue it is opposite another athletic field owned by a local school.|$|R
50|$|The park's {{main gate}} was {{extended}} outward {{to where the}} postcard letters formerly stood, and resembles the Pan-Pacific Auditorium like the entrance at cousin park, Disney's Hollywood Studios in Florida. The Red Car <b>Trolley</b> <b>travels</b> through the plaza. The main gate was opened on July 15, 2011. The construction of the Red Car trolleys began on January 10, 2010. Construction of Buena Vista Street itself began in October 2010 and opened on June 15, 2012. Throughout construction, the main entrance remained open with areas blocked off {{from time to time}} to aid in construction.|$|R
50|$|The 40th Street Portal, {{also known}} as simply 40th Street station, is a SEPTA Subway-Surface Lines trolley station in Philadelphia. At this station's portal, {{four of the five}} Subway-Surface Lines enter the Woodland Avenue subway tunnel after running on the street in Southwest Philadelphia and nearby suburbs. Eastbound {{trolleys}} run in the tunnel under the nearby campuses of the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University to Center City Philadelphia. Westbound <b>trolleys</b> <b>travel</b> to the Philadelphia neighborhoods of Eastwick and Angora and the Delaware County suburbs of Yeadon and Darby.|$|R
50|$|Providence Road {{station is}} a SEPTA Route 102 trolley stop in Aldan, Pennsylvania. It is officially located at Woodlawn Avenue and Providence Road. Because <b>trolleys</b> <b>travel</b> {{in the middle}} of the street at this stop, there are no platforms. Parking is not {{available}} and commuters must wait on the sidewalks for trolleys. However, unlike the nearby former Shisler Avenue stop and existing Magnolia Avenue stop, the Providence Road stop does have a shelter where commuters can go inside during bad weather. That shelter was converted into a museum in 1997.|$|R
50|$|The 80th Street-Eastwick station, {{also known}} as Island & 80th is a SEPTA trolley station in Philadelphia. It is the western {{terminus}} of the SEPTA Subway-Surface Lines Route 36 trolley and is located at Island Road near the former 80th Street intersection in the Eastwick neighborhood of Southwest Philadelphia. The station is near Island Avenue and I-95. The Eastwick station of the SEPTA Regional Rail Line to Philadelphia International Airport is {{within walking distance of}} the station. From the Eastwick Loop, the <b>trolleys</b> <b>travel</b> in a reserved, unpaved median along Island Avenue until entering the street at Buist Avenue. There are a series of unnamed stations on that portion of the line.|$|R

25|$|The only {{difference}} between this case and the original trolley problem is that an extra piece of track has been added, which seems a trivial difference (especially since the <b>trolley</b> won't <b>travel</b> down it anyway). So, if we originally decided that it is permissible or necessary to flip the switch, intuition may suggest that the answer should not have changed. However, in this case, {{the death of the}} one actually is part of the plan to save the five.|$|R
50|$|In 1903 the Washington and Canonsburg Railway Company {{linked the}} two towns with a trolley line. The company {{was bought by}} the Philadelphia Company in 1906, later {{becoming}} part of the Pittsburgh Railway Company, linking through to Pittsburgh as part of their interurban service in 1909. The line closed on August 29, 1953, with the last three <b>trolley</b> cars <b>travelling</b> south through Canonsburg to the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum in 1954 shortly before the track was removed.|$|R

50|$|The RTA {{operates}} with diesel {{and electric}} trolley buses. Dayton {{is the smallest}} city in the United States to still operate electric trolley buses. The <b>trolley</b> buses <b>travel</b> at least five miles on RTA routes serving Dayton and some neighboring suburbs. The routes include: Route 1, Route 2, Route 3, Route 4, Route 5, Route 7 and Route 8. Bus service to Dayton International Airport from downtown Dayton began on 11 August 2013. Service was expanded to stops on Pentagon Boulevard in Beavercreek, allowing access to the Fairfield Commons Mall and Soin Medical Center, on January 12, 2014.|$|R
25|$|The {{restoration}} of trolley service was delayed {{because of a}} long fight with local residents on 59th Street, which the <b>trolleys</b> needed to <b>travel</b> down in order to access the Callowhill Depot, over parking on the street. During {{the reconstruction of the}} line the surrounding neighborhoods, through grassroots coalitions, worked to improve the Girard Avenue streetscape through beautification and marketing projects. Since service returned in 2005, the 15 line has spurred various development projects as well as renewed investment along the corridor.|$|R
60|$|The {{conductors}} are, in fact, very civil {{as well as}} kind. If {{they see}} a horse in anxiety at {{the approach of the}} car, they considerately stop, and let him get by with his driver in safety. By such means, with their frequent trips and low fares, and with the ease and comfort of their cars, they have conciliated public favor, and the <b>trolley</b> has drawn <b>travel</b> away from the steam railroad in such measure that it ran no trains last winter.|$|R
50|$|The {{area was}} first called Willamette Falls, but later {{shortened}} to Willamette. The first mayor of Willamette was James Downey. The town consisted of approximately 300 residents. The main business within the town limits was the Capen Shoe Company Factory, located at 7th Avenue (now known as Willamette Falls Drive) and 12th Street. Each residence had electricity, {{running water and}} a sewage disposal system. Willamette had its own electric trolley service from the Main Street into town to the Willamette Falls Railroad station located at the bridge to Oregon City. Some residents used the <b>trolley</b> service to <b>travel</b> {{to work at the}} paper mills {{on the west side of}} the Willamette River and in Oregon City.|$|R
5000|$|Boring was platted in 1903 as [...] "Boring Junction" [...] {{after the}} {{construction}} of a railway line by the Portland Railway, Light and Power Company. The post office was established and named [...] "Boring" [...] the same year, and the builders of the interurban railway adopted Boring as the name of the community. An electric trolley operated on the railroad line to Portland, Oregon and Gresham, which began boarding passengers in 1905. The electric <b>trolley</b> severely cut <b>travel</b> time to and from the city; horse and buggy travel from Boring to Portland took an average of six hours, while a trip to Portland via the trolley system took only one hour. Though younger students in the area attended a local school built on Richey Road, high school students in Boring commuted via trolley to Gresham and Portland to attend high schools there. The early residents of the area post-settlement were mainly German and Swedish immigrants.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 26 - 29, 1992 / Town and Country Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe U. S. Army is {{developing}} an aerial cable range for testing missile weapon system components and other DOD material. The main {{component of the}} aerial cable range will be a three-mile-long Kevlar cable, fully suspended between two mountains, with an elevation difference of 2450 feet. Test vehicles (targets, test platforms, and retrieval <b>trolleys)</b> will <b>travel</b> along the cable at different speeds and different altitudes that conform to different test requirements. The main electronic support system for the aerial cable range will be the Ground Command and Control System (GCCS). The GCCS is being designed to control targets, retrieval trolleys, test fixtures, and test platforms on the aerial cable range. The GCCS will control up to four vehicles on the aerial cable at the same time. In the long term, {{the goal is to}} control test vehicles of 20, 000 pounds in weight and 550 knots/hour in speed. The initial capability will control targets and test platforms of 10, 000 pounds, at speeds of up to 250 knots/hour. The GCCS will consist of: • Telemetry links to communicate to and from various vehicles • A position measuring system to determine the position of the vehicle on the aerial cable • A control system to generate all commands necessary to activate events in the airborne vehicles • An operator console The control room will have the capability to display the vehicle parameters, meteorological data, lightning prediction data, video and real-time simulation...|$|R
40|$|With {{the growth}} of {{population}} and increase of travelling requirements in metropolitan areas, public transit has been recognized as a promising remedy and is playing an ever more important role in sustainable transportation systems. However, {{the development of the}} public transit system has not received enough attention until the recent emergence of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). In the conventional public transit system, little to no communication passes between transit vehicles and the roadside infrastructure, such as traffic signals and loop detectors. But now, thanks to advancements in automatic vehicle location (AVL) systems and wireless communication, real-time and high-resolution information of the movement of transit vehicles has become available, which may potentially facilitate the development of more advanced traffic control and management systems. This dissertation introduces a novel adaptive traffic signal control system, which utilizes the real-time location information of transit vehicles. By predicting the movement of the transit vehicle based on continuous detection of the vehicle motion by the on-board AVL system and estimating the measures of effectiveness (MOE) of other motor vehicles based on the surveillance of traffic conditions, optimal signal timings can be obtained by solving the proposed traffic signal optimization models. Both numerical analysis and simulation tests demonstrate that the proposed system improves a transit vehicle's operation as well as minimizes its negative impacts on other motor vehicles in the traffic system. In summary, there are three major contributions of this dissertation: a) development of a novel AVL-based adaptive traffic signal control system; b) modeling of the associated traffic signal timing optimization problem, which is the key component of the proposed system; c) applications of the proposed system to two real world cases. After presenting background knowledge on two major types of transit operations, i. e., preemption and priority, traffic signal control and AVL systems, the architecture of the proposed adaptive signal control system and the associated algorithm are presented. The proposed system includes a data-base, fleet equipped with surveillance system, traffic signal controllers, a transit movement predictor, a traffic signal timing optimizer and a request server. The mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) and nonlinear programming (NP) are used to formulate signal timing optimization problems. Then the proposed system and algorithm are applied to two real-world case studies. The first case study concerns the SPRINTER rail transit service. The proposed adaptive signal control (ASC) system is developed to relieve the traffic congestion and to clear the accumulated vehicle queues at the isolated signal around the grade crossing, based on the location information on SPRINTER from PATH-developed cellular GPS trackers. The second case study involves the San Diego trolley system. With the information provided by the AVL system, the proposed ASC system predicts the arrival times of the instrumented trolley at signals and provides the corresponding optimal signal timings to improve the schedule adherence, thus reducing the delays at intersections and enhancing the trip reliability for the <b>trolley</b> <b>travelling</b> along a signalized corridor in the downtown area under the priority operation. The negative impact (e. g., delay increase) on other traffic is minimized simultaneously. Both numerical analysis and simulation tests in the microscopic environment are conducted using the PARAMICS software to validate the proposed system for the aforementioned applications. The results present a promising future for further field operational testing...|$|R
