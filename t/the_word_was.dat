5|$|Cribb et al. (2014) {{suggest that}} Bontius' account {{referred}} not to apes (which were not known from Java) {{but rather to}} humans suffering some serious medical condition (most likely endemic cretinism) and that his use of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>was</b> misunderstood by Nicolaes Tulp, {{who was the first}} to use the term in a publication.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, {{he visited}} Istanbul; in 1888, Spain. At {{the end of}} 1890 he went to Africa, {{resulting}} in Listy z Afryki (Letters from Africa, published in The Word in 1891–92, then collected as a book in 1893). The turn of the 1880s and 1890s was associated with intensive work on several novels. In 1891 his novel Without dogma (Bez Dogmatu), previously serialized in 1889–90 in <b>The</b> <b>Word,</b> <b>was</b> published in book form. In 1892 Sienkiewicz signed an agreement for another novel, Rodzina Połanieckich (Children of the Soil), which was serialized in The Polish Gazette from 1893 and came out in book form in 1894.|$|E
5|$|The word afternoon, which {{derives from}} after and noon, has been attested from {{about the year}} 1300; Middle English {{contained}} both afternoon and the synonym aftermete. The standard locative marking for <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>was</b> at afternoon in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries but has shifted to in the afternoon since then. In Southern U.S. and Midland American English, the word evening is sometimes used to encompass all times between noon and night. The Irish language contains four different words to mark time intervals from late afternoon to nightfall, this period being considered mystical. Metaphorically, the word afternoon refers to a relatively late period in the expanse of time or in one's life.|$|E
25|$|Reduplication can <b>be</b> full (<b>the</b> entire <b>word</b> <b>is</b> repeated), monosyllabic (only one {{syllable}} of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>is</b> repeated), or bisyllabic (two syllables of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>are</b> repeated).|$|R

30|$|In this {{notation}} author(w) is {{the author}} who originally added <b>the</b> <b>word</b> w. This pointer is set at the revision when <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>is</b> added and is never changed afterward. The pointer deleter(w) gives the last user who deleted <b>the</b> <b>word.</b> It points to nil when <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>is</b> originally added (indicating that no one deleted it so far) and <b>is</b> updated whenever <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>is</b> deleted. <b>The</b> pointer restorer(w) identifies the last user who added or restored <b>the</b> <b>word.</b> It <b>is</b> set to the author when <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>is</b> originally added but, in contrast to author(w), the last restorer of a word can change over time when a <b>word</b> <b>is</b> restored after being deleted.|$|R

50|$|Most {{scholars}} {{believe that}} <b>the</b> <b>word</b> bakhar <b>is</b> a metathesis of <b>the</b> Arabic-origin <b>word</b> khabar ("information"). S N Joshi argues that <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>is</b> derived from <b>the</b> Persian <b>word</b> khair or bakhair ("all is well", the end salutation in a letter), since it {{appears at the}} end of most texts. Bapuji Sankpal argued that <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>is</b> derived from <b>the</b> Sanskrit-origin <b>word</b> akhyayika ("story").|$|R
50|$|A common {{strategy}} for finding all <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>is</b> {{to go through}} the puzzle left to right (or vice versa) and look for the first letter of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> (if a <b>word</b> list <b>is</b> provided). After finding the letter, one should look at the eight surrounding letters to see whether the next letter of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>is</b> there. One can then continue this method until <b>the</b> entire <b>word</b> <b>is</b> found.|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>is</b> {{correctly}} spelled {{within a}} set time, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>is</b> {{shown in a}} 5x5 grid.

25|$|The {{qualifying}} round {{was played}} in two parts. In the first part, {{a clue to}} <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>was</b> given. The point value for the word decreased by five points from a starting value of 100 for every third of a second no one rang in. If the value reached 25 points, host Chuck Henry would tell the contestants what line <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>was</b> on. In {{the second part of}} the round, a new board was played and the point values doubled. The first contestant to reach 1,000 points advanced to the championship round while the losing contestant went home with parting gifts.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>word</b> al-Mu'aqqibat <b>is</b> <b>the</b> plural of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> al-mua'qqibah. <b>The</b> <b>word</b> <b>is</b> {{derived from}} <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'aqiba meaning heel, from here <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>is</b> {{understood}} in <b>the</b> {{sense that it}} follows the following as his heels at the heels of putting the race. Pattern names used here meaning an emphasis and referred to {{is the language of}} the angels who were assigned to follow every creature of God in earnest.|$|R
50|$|Tharakan is an honorific title {{possessed by}} ancient traders. <b>The</b> <b>word</b> <b>is</b> rooted from Tamil word Tharaku/Tharavu-which means brokering or commission. <b>The</b> <b>word</b> <b>is</b> also linked with placing an order, tax or tariff and {{commodity}} trade. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>is</b> {{also related to}} lending money. In Tamil to denote a broker, people use Tharakar or Tharagar. So it can be assumed that a tharakan {{is the one who}} intermediates between manufacturer and buyer.|$|R

5000|$|For example, <b>the</b> Sanskrit <b>word</b> [...] "Rāma" [...] ( [...] , राम) is {{pronounced}} [...] "Rām" [...] ( [...] , राम्) in Hindi.

5000|$|Most authors {{assume a}} Basque origin but {{the origin of}} <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>is</b> {{ultimately}} unknown, except for the ending -in which frequently occurs in liquids (cf ozpin [...] "vinegar", pitipin or txuzpin [...] "watered wines"), <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>is</b> obscure.|$|R

50|$|Embryonated, unembryonated and de-embryonated are terms {{generally}} used {{in reference}} to eggs or, in botany, to seeds. <b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>are</b> often used as professional jargon rather than as universally applicable terms or concepts. Examples of relevant fields in which <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>are</b> useful include reproductive biology, virology, microbiology, parasitology, entomology, and poultry husbandry. Since <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>are</b> widely used in the various disciplines, {{there seems to be}} little present prospect of replacing them with universal, definitive, and distinct terms.|$|R
