40|$|Background: The {{technique}} of anterograde over a retrograde guide {{is considered to}} be more reliable and preferable in comparison to only retrograde one, for improving the success rate of retrograde intubation. As the prior technique requires a lengthy guidewire to negotiate the whole channel of a <b>tube</b> <b>guide,</b> we designed a side eye at one end of <b>tube</b> <b>guide,</b> which obviated the above requirement while maintaining the integrity of the whole channel assembly. The efficacy of this modified technique was compared with the conventional one for retrograde intubation procedure. Methods: In a prospective, randomised fashion, 98 cases posted for surgery of carcinoma buccal mucosa were included in this trial. These cases were randomised to the conventional (Group I) or the modified technique (Group II) for retrograde intubation. Intubation time (first attempt), total number of successful intubations, cause of failures and any associated side effects were recorded and compared between the groups. Results: The total number of successful intubations were significantly higher in group II (95. 83 %, 46 / 48 cases) as compared to group I (66. 66 %, 31 / 48 cases) (P< 0. 001). Mean intubation time was 118 ± 22 second in group I versus 124 ± 26 second in group II (P= 0. 39). The side effects did not differ significantly between the groups. Conclusions: Improvising the <b>tube</b> <b>guide</b> resulted in a significant {{rise in the number of}} successful intubations through a modified retrograde intubation technique, with no side effects. This should encourage the use of retrograde intubation technique as a first option for difficult airway management...|$|E
30|$|ETI was {{performed}} on a simple manikin head (Cparlene®, Adult Airway Larry manikin, CPR Savers & First Aid Supply, Scottsdale, USA) without any difficult ETI criteria, either with the DLM (blade size no. 3) or with the AWS. The AWS is a portable and battery-operated VDL with an integrated and wide-viewing-angle (180 °) liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor (6.1  cm) providing an indirect laryngoscopy of the airway via a charged coupled device attached to the blade tip of the AWS. The single-use intlock blade has a specific <b>tube</b> <b>guide</b> to accept the ETT (Fig.  1 a). Concerning AWS-ETI, in contrast to DLM-ETI, the ETT must be preloaded on the <b>tube</b> <b>guide</b> and ETI requires to load and lift the epiglottis with the blade tip. Once the target signal on the LCD monitor is aligned with the glottis opening, the ETT is passed through the vocal cords (Fig.  1 b). Then, the AWS is removed laterally, leaving the ETT in place. For AWS-ETI, the ETT was already preload in the blade-side channel before starting the ETI attempt. All ETI were performed with no introducer and a lubricated low-pressure cuffed ETT (Portex®, Smiths Medical, St Paul, USA) with an internal diameter of 7.5  mm. The manikin head was maintained in a neutral position, i.e., not in improved Jackson’s position. The good ETT position was confirmed by lung inflation with a manual self-inflating bag (AMBU® Mark IV, Ambu Corp., Ballerup, Denmark).|$|E

Mean (SD) insertion times were similar (LMA ProSeal, 40 (16) s; i-gel 43 (21) s). Mean oropharyngeal leak pressure was 7 cmH 2 O higher with the LMA ProSeal (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|The prime {{purpose of}} this paper is to base the {{discussion}} of the properties of propagation of electromagnetic waves inside a metal tube upon the theory of complex functions. The general expressions for the field components for different types of excitation systems are obtained in a rigorous manner starting from that of an electric and a magnetic dipole. The formal mathematical generalization is achieved by means of the transformation formulae of cylindrical functions and the results of the theory of integral equations. The integral equations thus obtained are expanded into series by aid of residual calculus for actual numerical calculation. The residues at the poles of singularities give rise to different "distinct modes" of propagation and thereby a comprehensive discussion of all the important physical properties is made. At the same time, problems arising in practical applications, say for long distance transmission for television purposes, are analyzed and some interesting conclusions obtained. The unique and rigorous analysis is only made possible by the free use of the results of the theory of complex functions. A comparison of the properties of propagation with regard especially to the attenuations and the velocities of propagation inside a hollow cylindrical metal <b>tube</b> <b>guide</b> and that of a concentric system is made. It is hoped that the conclusions obtained therefrom will throw some light on the merits of both systems and will point out those things which require careful consideration in practical design. </p...|$|E

40|$|For {{attaining}} {{a higher}} fueling efficiency in JT- 60 U centrifugal pellet injection experiments, <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> for a magnetic high-field side (HFS) injection were developed. The <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> for HFS (top) injection is about l 5 m in length, 5 mm in inner diameter and 600 mm {{in the smallest}} curvature radius, and has been connected to the upper port of the vacuum vessel. The speed exceeding 220 m/s led to pellet destruction in the <b>guide</b> <b>tube,</b> while the injected pellet mass estimated from the increase of plasma density reached about 80 Vo of that from low-field side (LFS) injection. A simple impact model was applied to explain the above result.

40|$|AbstractSafety rod <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> are {{important}} components of fast reactor cores for ensuring safe reactor operation. Their failure or considerable changes of their size {{may lead to}} safety rod wedging that is unacceptable. Two <b>guide</b> <b>tubes,</b> one each from BN- 350 and BOR- 60, were examined post-irradiation to determine {{the reasons for their}} deformation and loss of functionality. These tubes were constructed from high-nickel alloy EP- 150 and austenitic 18 Cr 9 Ni, respectively. It is found that various forms of deformation of safety rod <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> occur due to non-uniform swelling along the tube height, perimeter and across-wall thickness. The swelling gradients can lead to bowing and ovality, and can be accompanied by significant internal stresses within the tube material. The latter can lead to size reduction of <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> dimension in some directions due to irradiation creep. High levels of swelling-induced residual stresses, in combination with a swelling-induced embrittlement of the tube material, can lead to the tube failure {{even in the absence of}} any external loading...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The steam {{generators}} at Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor (AGR) nuclear power {{stations in the}} UK are potentially life-limiting components. Enhancing the capability to monitor the {{steam generators}} {{has been identified as}} having the potential to provide key evidence in justifying the extension of the generating lifetime of the stations. It has been proposed to install new temperature measuring instrumentation to monitor reactor gas temperature and to provide additional data regarding steam generator operating conditions. The modification will be to introduce thermocouples to the bore of an intact steam generator tube to facilitate temperature measurement at or near to the locations of interest. The modified steam generator tube will be sealed at the feed header upstand. Between the upper surface of the superheater header tubeplate and the wall of the superheater header, the thermocouple bundle and sheath will be contained within a rigid stainless steel <b>guide</b> <b>tube.</b> The <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> will be attached at both ends by welds, each forming a pressure boundary. At the tubeplate a weld will separate the bore of the sealed <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> from the steam space within the superheater header; a weld between the <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> and the superheater header will separate the steam space within the superheater header from atmosphere outside the header.

A new {{effective way to}} enhance the transmission of the ultracold neutrons through guides is demonstrated. This method involves internally coating stainless steel <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> with deuterated polystyrene using a spinning method, or with Fomblin oil. Results show that the UCN transmission in one metre is increased from about 37 % for the honed only <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> to about 84 % and 88 % when coated internally with deuterated polystyrene or with Fomblin oil respectively. The enhancement in the <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> surface quality due to the electropolishing process resulted in increasing the UCN transmission rate for the honed tube from 37 % to about 81 %. So coating a honed only tube with deuterated polystyrene or with Fomblin oil gave better transmission rates than electropolishing the tube and not coating it. The transmission measurements are for neutrons with an average axial velocity of about 9. 2 m s"-" 1.
