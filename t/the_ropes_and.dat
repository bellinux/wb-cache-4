5|$|To this end, {{a crew of}} 12 {{prepared}} a ship that had been seized in Gibraltar. They disguised vertical logs of wood with headwear, to make the Spaniards believe that the vessel was fully crewed. To make it look more heavily armed, additional portholes were cut in the hull and logs placed to resemble cannons. Barrels of powder {{were placed in the}} ship and grappling irons laced into the ships rigging, to catch <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> sails of Magdalen and ensure the vessels would become entangled.|$|E
5|$|In round four, Judah {{landed a}} {{right hand to}} the head that caused Mayweather to retreat to <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> cover up. The {{momentum}} changed in the fifth round, when Mayweather hurt Judah with a combination to the face. Then Mayweather landed a right hand {{on the bridge of}} Judah's nose, and blood began to flow. The seventh round was the most dominant for Mayweather to that point. Once again, he drew blood from Judah's nose. A combination from Mayweather backed Judah into a corner, and Judah's foot movement was considerably slower than it had been earlier in the fight.|$|E
5|$|On August 25, one the Cochinos 4,000-pound {{batteries}} caught fire, emitting {{hydrogen gas}} and smoke. Unable to receive {{any help from}} the Tusk, Commander Benitez directed the firefighting. He ordered the Cochino to surface and had the crew members lash themselves to the deck rails with ropes while others fought the blaze. Benitez tried to save his ship {{and at the same}} time save his men from the toxic gases. He realized that the winds were about to tear <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> ordered his men to form a pyramid on the ship's open bridge, which was designed to hold seven men.|$|E

5|$|The SPARS enjoyed {{success in}} the work place, but they also {{suffered}} a degree of intolerance at times. On more than one occasion, male guardsmen would {{make the point that}} the USCG had struggled along without women for over 150 years. Attitudes toward them ranged from enthusiasm and amusement to open hostility. But not all the objections were personal or petty. Many of the men simply failed to see the need for women in the service, while others felt it was an unnecessary expense. However, if the women were equal to the job the men were willing to give them their due. Many men, regulars and reservists, supported them, taught them <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> <b>and</b> gave them encouragement.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was defended next in {{what was}} {{originally}} promoted as a Three Way match but was fought under elimination rules. Christopher Daniels defended the title against Chris Sabin, who was accompanied by Trinity, and Michael Shane, who was accompanied by Traci. Near the 11 minute mark, Sabin eliminated Shane after performing his signature Cradle Shock maneuver. With the match down to Sabin and Daniels, Daniels gained a near-fall after performing his signature Best Moonsault Ever aerial maneuver. Sabin also gained a near-fall after jumping off <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> driving Daniels' head into the mat. Daniels eventually won the bout at 17 minutes and 10 seconds by utilizing his signature Angel's Wings maneuver.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} calm for Pagan {{ended in the}} early 1270s. By then, the Song were on <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> <b>and</b> Emperor Kublai Khan, who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271, sought {{to cut off the}} retreat of Song {{refugees}} in all directions. In Pagan's case, he had ordered the Mongol governor of Dali to tighten control of the borderlands, and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute. The tribute he demanded was nominal. Given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere, the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan. At the border, the ruler of the Wa and Palaung regions submitted to the Mongols.|$|E
6000|$|... "He barks louder," [...] {{said the}} soldier. [...] "Look out for him; {{he may be}} dangerous." [...] The next moment he threw <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> <b>and</b> caught poor Zingle around his arms and body, {{so that he was}} helpless. Then the soldier-monkey pulled hard on <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> <b>and</b> Prince Zingle fell out of the tree to the ground.|$|R
6000|$|It was an {{hour before}} the coast was entirely clear and then a moment came when no Wieroo was in sight. [...] "Now!"

A moment later Bradley felt two quick pulls upon <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> <b>and</b> immediately followed to the girl's side.|$|R
60|$|In a nutshell, {{what had}} {{occurred}} was this: You {{know how you}} aquaplane. A motor-boat nips on ahead, trailing a rope. You stand on a board, holding <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> boat tows you along. And {{every now and then}} you lose your grip on <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> <b>and</b> plunge into <b>the</b> sea and have to swim to your board again.|$|R
5|$|A.J. Styles {{went on to}} Destination X {{to defend}} the TNA X Division Championship in an Ultimate X Challenge match. An Ultimate X Challenge match has three stages. Stage one {{involves}} the four men being paired up into two tag teams and having a standard tag team match, with {{the person who is}} pinned being eliminated from the bout. Then it becomes a standard match involving three people, with the one being pinned in that phase being eliminated from the match. The final two then fight to climb <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> retrieve the championship that hangs in the middle. The participants were announced for the match on the March 11 episode of Impact!, with Elix Skipper and Ron Killings being added to face Styles. The final participant was determined in a match that pitted Christopher Daniels against Chris Sabin, which Daniels won. Styles would lose the championship to Daniels at the event.|$|E
5|$|Crush {{attacked}} Doink the Clown {{outside the}} ring {{prior to the}} next match. After getting Doink inside the ring, Crush used his strength advantage to overpower Doink. Doink gained the advantage but missed two attacks from the top rope. Crush used more power moves to wear down Doink, and Doink tried to crawl under the ring. Crush forced Doink back into the ring and performed the Cranium Crunch, a head vice submission hold, on Doink. Doink pulled himself to <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> broke the hold. Doink hit the referee and knocked him unconscious; {{as a result of}} this staged ref bump, a second Doink the Clown (portrayed by Steve Keirn) was able to interfere. He hit Crush with a prosthetic arm, which enabled the first Doink to win by pinfall when the referee regained consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Cotto's next {{fight was}} on December 1, 2012, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. His {{opponent}} was the undefeated WBA Super Welterweight Champion Austin Trout. Trout started the fight off fast, using his quick combinations to continually get his punches off first against Cotto. Trout also used his superior footwork to evade most of Cotto's punches, {{and was able}} to out muscle Cotto off the ropes when he was cornered in the fight. During the middle rounds, Cotto found success trapping Trout on <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> keeping him there, ripping Trout with body shots and finding the range with his left hook. Trout regained control in the later rounds, even backing Cotto up later in the fight, and stunned Cotto several times down the stretch with his straight left hand. Trout won the fight by a wide unanimous decision, giving him the biggest win of his career thus far. The judges scores were 117-111, 117-111, 119-109. Trout landed 238 of 779 punches (31%) and Cotto landed 183 of 628 punches thrown (29%). After the fight, Trout called out fellow light middleweight champion Canelo Álvarez. The fight averaged averaged 1.047 million and peaked at 1.4 million viewers, which set a record for Showtime boxing.|$|E

5|$|On July 26, 2008, at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Cotto {{suffered}} {{his first}} loss {{as a professional}} to Antonio Margarito in an unsuccessful title defense. Cotto had taken the early initiative, frequently landing a series of punches on Margarito during the early rounds while using his footwork to avoid danger. However, Margarito presented constant offensive pressure of Cotto and eventually began to wear down Cotto's resistance by trapping him against the ropes. Cotto was hurt in the seventh round after a pair of Margarito uppercuts caused his nose to bleed. Margarito continued to chase his opponent down and inflicted further damage {{towards the end of}} the tenth round. Margarito then threw a series of punches at the start of the eleventh round, with Cotto against <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> bleeding profusely. A combination from Margarito finally forced Cotto to his knee. He got up, but Margarito continued landing combinations. Evangelista Cotto threw in the towel after Cotto again fell to the canvas in the corner of the ring. Two judges had Margarito ahead by a score of 96–94 at the time of the stoppage, while the third scored the fight even. HBO analyst Harold Lederman had also scored the fight even. Cotto's loss to Margarito has since come under suspicion due to Margarito's subsequent attempted use of illegal hand-wraps in a fight against Shane Mosley.|$|E
5|$|On the August 1 {{episode of}} Raw, Vince McMahon officially {{announced}} Hardy's return to WWE, adding that Hardy would face Edge at SummerSlam. Hardy made his in-ring return, defeating Snitsky on the August 8 Raw. Seconds after the victory, Hardy {{was attacked by}} Edge, and as he was being carried backstage, Matt counterattacked Edge in the locker room. On August 21 at SummerSlam, their match came to a premature end when Edge dropped Hardy onto {{the top of a}} ring post, causing him to bleed heavily. The referee ended the match on the grounds that Hardy could not continue, and Edge was declared the winner. After SummerSlam, the two continued fighting on Raw, including a Street Fight that resulted in Hardy performing a Side Effect on Edge off the entrance stage and into electrical equipment below. At Unforgiven, Edge faced Hardy in a steel cage match. Hardy caught an interfering Lita with the Twist of Fate and won the match with a leg-drop {{off the top of the}} cage. Hardy and Edge faced each other at WWE Homecoming in a Loser Leaves Raw ladder match. Edge's briefcase holding his Money in the Bank Contract for his WWE Championship opportunity was suspended above the ring. The winner of the match received the contract and the loser was forced to leave Raw. After a contentious match, Edge tied Hardy's arms in <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> <b>and</b> Lita trapped Hardy in a crucifix hold, leaving Hardy only able to watch Edge win. When the match ended, Edge and Lita gloated over the victory, but Hardy took it in stride and left the arena.|$|E
5|$|For the Ladder match, the Intercontinental belts {{belonging}} to Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels were both hanging above the ring, {{and the first}} wrestler to use the ladder to reach both belts would be declared the winner. Ramon began the match by chokeslamming Michaels. Michaels recovered, however, and performed a neckbreaker on Ramon. Michaels then threw Ramon out to the ringside, where Michaels' bodyguard Diesel clotheslined Ramon. Referee Earl Hebner responded by ordering Diesel {{to return to the}} dressing rooms. Ramon pulled up the padding from the concrete floor, but he was later thrown onto it after Michaels reversed Ramon's attempt to perform the Razor's Edge. While Ramon was lying on the floor, Michaels brought the ladder to the ring and used it to hit Ramon in the stomach, chest and back. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts, but Ramon stopped him from climbing the ladder. Michaels then set the ladder up {{in the corner of the}} ring and performed a splash onto Ramon. Ramon recovered and Irish whipped Michaels into the ladder. He then hit Michaels with the ladder several times before both men tried to climb up to get the belts. Ramon suplexed Michaels off the ladder and tried to reach the belts. Michaels dropkicked the ladder, which caused Ramon to fall off. Michaels performed a superkick and a piledriver on Ramon and then propped the ladder up in the corner of the ring. Michaels climbed the turnbuckles, jumped onto the ladder, and used his weight to push it down across Ramon's chest. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts again, but Ramon pushed him off. Michaels fell into <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> got tangled up, allowing Ramon to get the belts and win the undisputed Intercontinental championship.|$|E
