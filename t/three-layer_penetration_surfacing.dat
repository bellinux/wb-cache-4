The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the uniformity and <b>penetration</b> of <b>surface</b> modification into textile materials including fiber, yarn and fabric treated by atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ).

40|$|Molecular {{diffusion}} {{is fundamental}} to mass transport and understanding the basic mechanism of this phenomenon and quantitative estimation of the same is critical to mass transfer operations viz. distillation, absorption/stripping, liquid-liquid extraction etc. In this project, two contrastingly different cases were selected to experimentally measure binary diffusion coefficients. It is important to highlight the fact that any industrial mass transfer operation involves multi-component system; however, suitable binary system data can be effectively used to estimate the multi-component system. Similarly, for any unit operation involving more than a single-phase (and hence presence of an interphase), it is the local or overall mass transfer co-efficient which explains the mass transfer operation prevailing within the system and can be effectively measured in wetted wall column experiments. However, suitably measured diffusivity data can easily be used in estimating the mass transfer coefficients using fundamental concepts of various predictive theories like (film, <b>penetration,</b> <b>surface</b> renewal and boundary layer). In this work, several organic solvents viz. benzene, toluene, acetone, carbon-tetrachloride were used to measure their diffusion coefficients in air at widely different temperatures and at atmospheric pressure. Similarly, solids of different geometries (both spherical as well as cylindrical) were chosen to measure the diffusivity.

Concrete performance is affected by the quantity and quality of the paste, and aggregate systems. Therefore, this study analyzed the effect of binder systems with different types and content; the paste quality; and size, shape, texture and gradation of different aggregate systems on various fresh and hardened concrete properties. In this experimental program, a total of 178 mixtures were prepared with 7 different gradation systems, 12 binder systems, 25 binder contents, 6 different water-to-binder ratio (w/b), and 3 different nominal air content. Fresh properties of slump, air content, air-void system, setting time, unit weight, and temperature were tested. Hardened properties of compressive strength, rapid chloride <b>penetration,</b> <b>surface</b> resistivity, air permeability, and shrinkage were tested at various ages. However, to develop such a tool, this study overall focused on the assessment of workability, compressive strength, and durability as these three properties are commonly used as indicators of concrete performance. Durability was assessed by testing the rapid chloride <b>penetration,</b> and <b>surface</b> resistivity at 28 -days. As part of this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) approach has been used for concrete mix proportion design to analyze the complexity between concrete properties and concrete components. Results have shown that development of a performance-based mix proportioning tool is possible for mixtures when aggregate gradation is not varied. Development of a mix proportioning tool with addition of the various aggregates systems generally was not as successful due to the increased variability of the mix design parameters such as size, shape, texture, and gradation of aggregates. The proposed mix proportioning tool is promising and achievable in terms of predicting the values of the tested properties based on the mix design variables. Although the proposed mix proportioning tool is not completely ready for prime time, the findings of this study can be implemented in real time when this approach is used with a larger data set...|$|R

40|$|A new {{constant}} pressure pendant-drop <b>penetration</b> <b>surface</b> balance {{has been developed}} combining a pendant-drop surface balance, a rapid-subphase-exchange technique, and a fuzzy logic control algorithm. Beside the determination of insoluble monolayer compression–expansion isotherms, it allows performance of noninvasive kinetic studies of the adsorption of surfactants added to the new subphase onto the free surface and of the adsorption/penetration/reaction of the former onto/into/with surface layers, respectively. The interfacial pressure π is a fundamental parameter in these studies: by working at constant π one controls {{the height of the}} energy barrier to adsorption/penetration and can select different regimes and steps of the adsorption/penetration process. In our device a solution drop is formed at the tip of a coaxial double capillary, connected to a double microinjector. Drop profiles are extracted from digital drop micrographs and fitted to the equation of capillarity, yielding π, the drop volume V, and the interfacial area A. π is varied changing V (and hence A) with the microinjector. Control is based on a case-adaptable modulated fuzzy-logic PID algorithm able to maintain constant π (or A) under a wide range of experimental conditions. The drop subphase liquid can be exchanged quantitatively by the coaxial capillaries. The adsorption/penetration/reaction kinetics at constant π are then studied monitoring A(t), i. e., determining the relative area change necessary at each instant to compensate the pressure variation due to the interaction of the surfactant in the subsurface with the surface layer. A fully Windows-integrated program manages the whole setup. Examples of experimental protein adsorption and monolayer penetration kinetics are presented.

40|$|Microneedle is a {{promising}} technique for delivering {{high molecular weight}} drugs across skin. The microneedles can offer a number of benefits over other drug delivery methods. For example, the drugs only diffuse over a short distance before reaching the blood circulation which enhances the absorption of drugs by the tissue. However, the drug transport behaviour in skin is affected by a complex interplay of many parameters (e. g., microneedle geometries, permeability across skin, etc). In this thesis, {{many aspects of the}} microneedle field were examined. A mathematical model for drug transport from microneedle systems into skin was developed. Issues such as microneedle <b>penetration,</b> <b>surface</b> area of the microneedle arrays, etc. were investigated. This work helped us to focus into optimizing the design of microneedles by developing an in-house algorithm to enhance the performance of transdermal drug delivery using microneedles. Following the development of this algorithm, the influence of skin thickness with its classification (i. e., age group, race, etc.) on drug permeability across skin was studied. Attention was then given to determine the effective permeability (Peff) and the effective skin thickness (Heff) for various solid microneedle models. The outcome of this research allowed us to study the influence of microneedle dimensions on the drug concentration in blood (Cb). Furthermore, the 'pattern' (shape) of the microneedles array (i. e., square or rectangular) and the 'distribution' (arrangement) of the microneedles inside an array (i. e., triangular or diamond) were investigated to identify the optimum microneedle models. Finally, the effect of skin metabolism on both the patch (without microneedles) and the microneedle arrays on drug intake were examined.

This study uses a finite difference continuum modelling code, Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAG), to test whether deep <b>penetration</b> of <b>surface</b> fluids is mechanically feasible in relation to ore formation. Several “conceptual models” were tested and model boundary conditions were conducive to an extensional collapse of the mountain range. During extensional deformation, downward fluid flow is evident along a subvertical fault for reasonable strain rates and topographic elevation. Throughout deformation, fluids move progressively deeper into the model. Deeper seated fluid is forced upwards {{from the base of}} the model due to perturbations in hydraulic head and pore pressure. Both fluids mix at intermediate levels and this mixing process becomes progressively deeper within the model as extension takes place. Fluid mixing is apparent at the banded iron formation (BIF) and fault boundaries, as is lateral fluid migration along the BIF layers. This study supports the hypothesis that downward flow of meteoric fluid may have played a role in the evolution of the microplaty hematite ores. However, unlike the model of Morris [Morris. R.
