25|$|Planning of {{an airport}} at Vidrek started in 1968 and in early 1969 the company A/S Narvik Flyplass was established. Meetings were held with the ministry, {{where it was}} {{determined}} that planning would have to wait until further reports were made on the regional network in Nordland. Kyllingmark stated in 1970 that he intended to allow Narvik to receive a regional airport. The break-through for Narvik Airport came when the mining company LKAB, which exports its ore through Narvik, needed a place to dump earthwork. An agreement was made with the municipality whereby it received the earthwork free of charge and placed at a suitable location at Framneslia, a lot which was owned by LKAB. The municipal council approved in July 1971 plans to build a short take-off and landing airport at Framneslia, based on a thirteen-year free lease of the land. Government permission for a general aviation airport was issued in early 1972 and <b>technical</b> <b>approval</b> from the Civil Aviation Administration was granted in August.

40|$|The {{specific}} research {{described in}} this dissertation {{is based on the}} author’s work over the years as head of the Eduardo Torroja Institute for Construction Science’s 4 Technical Unit for the Assessment of Innovative Construction Products. The hypothesis proposed is the feasibility of developing methodology able to deliver a preliminary estimate (in just 1 ‐ 3 months’ time) of the technical suitability of certain innovative construction products for their intended use. The product families studied are the object of technical assessment guides or guidelines authored by two European organisations, the Union Européenne pour l'agrément technique dans la construction (UEAtc) and the European Organization for Technical Assessment (EOTA). Such families are eligible for or have been awarded <b>technical</b> <b>approvals</b> (TAs, also referred to in English under the French term “agréments”) or European <b>Technical</b> <b>Approvals</b> (ETAs), which is presently an 11 ‐month process. The proposed methodology would consist of a pre‐assessment procedure referred to hereunder as DIT PREASSESSMENT/PREEVALUACIÓN (Spanish initials, PPD). Based on the experience obtained from trials, calculations and studies undertaken in the framework of this research, the proposed procedure would identify the performance factors (primarily identification and fitness for use, although also durability where ascertainable via shortterm testing) that predict construction product or system suitability in a more immediate time frame...|$|R

5000|$|The {{rarity of}} major {{disasters}} tends to breed complacency {{and even a}} contempt for written instructions.

Where management lays down safety rules, it must also ensure that they are carried out. We believe that to this end considerable formality is essential in relation to such matters as permits to work and clearance certificates to enter vessels or plant areas. In order to keep strong control in the plant, the level of authority for authorisations must be clearly defined. Similarly the level of authority for <b>technical</b> <b>approval</b> for any plant modification must also be clearly defined.

25|$|Highly {{centralised}} {{decision-making and}} approvals {{at the state}} level, which are characteristic of the Indian civil service, affect the management of {{water supply and sanitation}} services. For example, according to the World Bank in the state of Punjab the process of approving designs is centralised with even minor <b>technical</b> <b>approvals</b> reaching the office of chief engineers. A majority of decisions are made in a very centralised manner at the headquarters. In 1993 the Indian constitution and relevant state legislations were amended in order to decentralise certain responsibilities, including water supply and sanitation, to municipalities. Since the assignment of responsibilities to municipalities is a state responsibility, different states have followed different approaches. According to a Planning Commission report of 2003 there is a trend to decentralise capital investment to engineering departments at the district level and operation and maintenance to district and gram panchayat levels.|$|R

According to building plan submitted - by the original firm that designed the villa, 11 blocks of four-storey houses would be built; a total floor area would be 60,000 square feet. The case came before the Antiquities Advisory Board in July 2010, where it was listed as a Grade I historic building, although such declaration does not confer statutory protection. In late January 2011, the Government of Hong Kong invoked the Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance {{for the fourth time}} in history, declared it a [...] "proposed historic monument", thus imposing a 12-month moratorium on redevelopment of the site, pending negotiations with the owner. In October 2011, two government consultancy reports, by experts at the University of Hong Kong and submitted to the Antiquity Advisory Board, concluded that it has high historical and architectural value. On 24 October 2011, the Antiquities Advisory Board approved the government proposal to declare the Ho Tung Gardens on the Peak a monument. Bernard Chan, Chairman of the AAB argued to preserve the mansions because [...] "The choice of a very Chinese-looking style of architecture for the new house in 1927 ... was a statement that a racial barrier was being broken. It was also a declaration by Hotung that he was different from his neighbors, who were only living in the colony temporarily before going home." [...] However, some other architectural historians believe that the mansion is an ordinary piece of architecture at the time that cannot be compared with other examples of [...] "Chinese Renaissance" [...] architecture such as King Yin Lei and Haw Par Mansion.|$|E
