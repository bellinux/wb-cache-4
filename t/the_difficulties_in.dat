5|$|Agricultural emissions, methane from enteric {{fermentation}} and manure management {{as well as}} nitrous oxide from animal effluent and fertiliser, were to enter the scheme on 1 January 2015. A 'Questions and Answers' fact sheet released by Nick Smith (Minister for Climate Change Issues) stated that the delayed entry was due to <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> measuring and monitoring agricultural emissions and the limited technologies available for reducing emissions in the sector.|$|E
5|$|Although {{europium}} {{is present}} {{in most of the}} minerals containing the other rare elements, due to <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> separating the elements {{it was not until the}} late 1800s that the element was isolated. William Crookes observed the phosphorescent spectra of the rare elements including those eventually assigned to europium.|$|E

RSA is based on <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>in</b> factoring an integer [11] and ElGamal is based on <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>in</b> computing a discrete logarithm in polynomial time [21]. Paillier is another asymmetric encryption algorithm based on <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>in</b> factoring an integer, but its homomorphic property is additive [17].|$|R

5|$|The {{borders in}} South-east Alaska were disputed between the US, Canada and Britain since the American {{purchase}} of Alaska from Russia in 1867. The US and Canada both claimed the ports of Dyea and Skagway. This, {{combined with the}} numbers of American prospectors, the quantities of gold being mined and <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> exercising government authority in such a remote area, made {{the control of the}} borders a sensitive issue.|$|E
5|$|Bowen was {{prompted}} {{to write the}} story of the relocated wolves after becoming outraged over the continued poaching of wolves in the protected areas of Ninemile Valley. She spent four years researching wolves while working on the novel. In recounting the fates of the animals at the end, she expresses hope in the ideals behind efforts to restore wolf populations. Nominated for a 2006 Teens' Top Ten award by the American Library Association, the novel was praised by critics. Two praised Bowen's ability to avoid anthropomorphism while capturing the essence of wolf behavior and life. Another also praised the story's highlighting of <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> wolf relocation programs.|$|E
5|$|In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a {{theoretical}} role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special {{role in the}} radiation shield. One of <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons {{continue to be a}} radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.|$|E

After intensive negotiations that called upon Walker's extensive connections and civic experience, in 1887 the legislature made a grant of $300,000 over two years to the Institute, which would lead to a total of $1.6 million in grants from the Commonwealth before the practice was discontinued in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{language}} is a philosophical problem arising from <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> accurately describing God. Because God is generally conceived as incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, ordinary language cannot always apply to that entity. This makes speaking about or attributing properties to God difficult: a religious believer might simultaneously wish to describe God as good, yet also hold that God's goodness is unique and cannot be articulated by human language of goodness. This raises {{the problem of how}} (and whether) God can be meaningfully spoken about at all, which causes problems for religious belief since the ability to describe and talk about God is important in religious life. The French philosopher Simone Weil expressed this problem in her work Waiting for God, in which she outlined her dilemma: she was simultaneously certain of God's love and conscious that she could not adequately describe him.|$|E
5|$|Scandium {{is present}} {{in most of the}} {{deposits}} of rare-earth and uranium compounds, but it is extracted from these ores in only a few mines worldwide. Because of the low availability and <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> the preparation of metallic scandium, which was first done in 1937, applications for scandium were not developed until the 1970s. The positive effects of scandium on aluminium alloys were discovered in the 1970s, and its use in such alloys remains its only major application. The global trade of scandium oxide is about 10 tonnes per year.|$|E

5|$|The Government's {{adherence}} to secularism {{has been criticized}} in that the unwritten principle of secularism has trumped the constitutional protection of freedom of religion. For instance, in 2002 a controversy arose upon the suspension of four Muslim girls from school when their parents insisted that they wear the tudung (Islamic headscarf) to national schools. Section 61 of the Education Act empowers the Minister for Education to regulate schools, including prohibiting students from wearing anything not forming part of an official school uniform. The parents of the schoolgirls took {{the view that the}} Ministry of Education's school uniform policy was unconstitutional as it violated the girls' freedom of religion under Article 15(1). While the parents eventually did not pursue legal proceedings against the Ministry, the controversy showed the Singapore Government's steadfastness in insisting on secularism and <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> reconciling secularism and freedom of religion in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The storyline {{was written}} by former Star Trek writer D.C. Fontana, while the script was created by John Meredyth Lucas. A promotional cereal {{competition}} was run in conjunction with Quaker Oats, the first for the license in the United States. Despite this promotion, the game was cancelled with estimates placing it at only 5% completion. The cast of The Original Series had already recorded their voices. Lead engineer Thom Robertson later explained the studio had underestimated {{the cost of the}} game and <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> filming the clay models.|$|E
5|$|A study {{published}} by Mulungushi University indicated that age distortions {{were found in}} census data and a tendency of age heaping with terminal digits of ‘0’ and ‘5’ were common. It also reported that gender differences existed in age reporting in Zambia with more number of males reporting their ages wrongly. But the report acknowledged <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> data collection and stated {{that the quality of}} data collection was better than the previous census enumerations. Another {{study published}} in the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health journal indicated that the census reported very high adult female mortality, particularly a high pregnancy-related mortality in both rural and urban areas twelve months prior to the census. The evaluation of population age, age-at-death, live births were reported to contain data errors. Another study by Demographic Research indicated that the data of people aged above 80 was not accurately captured in most sub-Saharan countries, which prevented research on age-related health ailments and other socio-economic characteristics.|$|E

5|$|God of War: Betrayal was {{announced}} by Sony Online Entertainment {{at a press}} conference in Los Angeles in May 2007. The game utilizes a total of 110 different animations and features a 2D rendition of the series' three dimensional (3D) graphics. The character art and animation were done by WayForward Technologies. The only audio components are an orchestral score in the main menu and background sounds (e.g., clashing weapons). In August 2007, Phil Cohen, producer, designer, and game director for Betrayal, spoke of <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> developing a God of War game for a mobile device. Cohen said that although enjoyable, the greatest challenge was creating a single tileset and palette swapping scheme that was diverse enough to portray multiple environments with only several hundred kilobytes, and that met series creator Santa Monica Studio's high standards. He wrote the initial design document between September and October 2005, and revisited it in August 2006, the month development started. The versions for high-end handsets were completed in April 2007, with final versions for low-end handsets completed by June 2007. The porting team adapted the game to over 200 handsets in a matter of weeks.|$|E
5|$|Since its publication, {{some have}} viewed {{the book with}} skepticism. Some in the Middle Ages {{regarded}} the book simply as a romance or fable, due largely to the sharp difference of its descriptions of a sophisticated civilisation in China to other early accounts by Giovanni da Pian del Carpine and William of Rubruck who portrayed the Mongols as 'barbarians' who appeared to belong to 'some other world'. Doubts have also been raised in later centuries about Marco Polo's narrative of his travels in China, for example for his failure to mention the Great Wall of China, and in particular <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> identifying many of the place names he used (the great majority however have since been identified). Many have questioned if he had visited the places he mentioned in his itinerary, if he had appropriated the accounts {{of his father and}} uncle or other travelers, and some doubted if he even reached China, or that if he did, perhaps never went beyond Khanbaliq (Beijing).|$|E
5|$|The {{trials were}} delayed due to <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> {{bringing}} together witnesses, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and interpreters. The proceedings finally began in August 1828, with Judge James Duane Doty presiding. Wau-koo-kau and Man-ne-tah-peh-keh, the two warriors imprisoned for the 1826 murders of the Methode family, were released {{due to a}} lack of witnesses, as were three Ho-Chunks held for the attack on the keelboats. Only two men, Wekau and Chickhonsic, were prosecuted. According to historian Patrick Jung, it became clear during the trial that Red Bird had committed the murders at the Gagnier cabin, and that there was not enough evidence to convict Wekau and Chickhonsic. Despite this, the white and métis jury found them guilty. Judge Doty sentenced them to hang, as he was required to do by law. Their lawyer filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the jury had ignored the evidence, and so Doty suspended the death sentences.|$|E
