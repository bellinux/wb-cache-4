5|$|A {{major change}} from The <b>Two</b> <b>Towers</b> is the {{interactive}} {{nature of the}} game environments. The player can operate machinery, for example bridges and catapults, to complete objectives, and use environmental objects as weapons, such as spears and cauldrons, to kill enemies. The levels are also {{twice the size of}} the largest level from The <b>Two</b> <b>Towers</b> and many are less linear. Unlike The <b>Two</b> <b>Towers,</b> The Return of the King features a co-op mode, allowing two players to play through the game together. The North American PlayStation 2 version also has an online multiplayer mode, with USB headset support, although this was removed from the European version of the game.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Two</b> <b>Towers</b> won {{two out of}} six Academy Award {{nominations}} {{and three}} accolades out of ten nominations at the 56th British Academy Film Awards. Like its predecessor, the second film also received recognition at the American Film Institute Awards, the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards, the Empire Awards, the Golden Globes, the MTV Movie Awards, the Satellite Awards, and the Saturn Awards. Various critics groups, such as Chicago, Phoenix, and Seattle also awarded the film. In total, The <b>Two</b> <b>Towers</b> received 136 awards out of 222 nominations.|$|E
5|$|The {{first film}} has around 540 effect shots, the second 799, {{and the third}} 1,488 (2,730 in total). The total {{increases}} to 3,420 with the extended editions. 260 visual effect artists began work on the series, and the number doubled by The <b>Two</b> <b>Towers.</b> The crew, led by Jim Rygiel and Randy Cook, worked long hours, often overnight, to produce special effects within a short space of time. Jackson's active imagination was a driving force. For example, several major shots of Helm's Deep were produced within {{the last six weeks}} of post-production of The <b>Two</b> <b>Towers,</b> and the same happened again within the last six weeks on The Return of the King.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} {{thriving}} independent and artisan food sector in Birmingham, encompassing microbreweries like <b>Two</b> <b>Towers,</b> and collective bakeries such as Loaf. Recent years have seen these businesses increasingly showcased at farmers markets, popular street food events and food festivals including Birmingham Independent Food Fair.|$|E

5|$|A Gothic {{screen was}} also {{added to the}} Norman nave at Peterborough, {{but this is an}} {{architectural}} oddity with no precedent or successor. The screen is composed of three enormous open arches, the two outer ones being much wider than that which frames the central door. The overwhelming composition is somewhat spoilt by the later porch and the fact that <b>two</b> <b>towers</b> of very different height pop up from behind the screen. Despite this, it is {{regarded as one of the}} supreme masterpieces of Gothic, revealing the enormous diversity and imagination of English medieval architects.|$|E
5|$|After the Revolution {{the senior}} {{branch of the}} Rochefoucauld family regained possession. The château was renovated {{in the first half}} of the 19th century. The work was {{undertaken}} by the La Villéons in the romantic style that accompanied the Bourbon Restoration after 1815. They added decorations to the windows and made false arrow slots, added <b>two</b> <b>towers</b> to the south facade, added a flamboyant balustrade and dormer windows, and made changes to part of the chapel.|$|E
5|$|Faramir first {{enters the}} {{narrative}} in person in The <b>Two</b> <b>Towers,</b> where, upon meeting Frodo Baggins, he is {{presented with a}} temptation to take possession of the One Ring. In The Return of the King, he led the forces of Gondor during the War of the Ring, coming near to death, and eventually succeeded his father as the Steward and won the love of Éowyn of Rohan.|$|E

5|$|In September 2011, the {{intersection}} of LaSalle Street and Jackson Boulevard {{in front of the}} building became the headquarters for the Occupy Chicago protest movement. On April 23, 2013, the CME Group sold the north and south towers of the building at 141 W. Jackson Blvd. for $151.5 Million to a joint venture between GlenStar Properties LLC and USAA Real Estate Co. The CME will retain ownership of the smaller east building at 333 S. LaSalle St. CME signed a 15-year lease for the 150,000 square-feet it occupies in the <b>two</b> <b>towers.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{extended}} edition of The <b>Two</b> <b>Towers,</b> Jackson included an invented flashback scene showing that Denethor had neglected him {{in favour of}} Boromir when sending him to Rivendell, so that Faramir wanted to please his father by bringing him the Ring. (The relationship is similarly strained in the book, but his father's favouritism {{does not seem to}} affect his decisions in Ithilien.) Reviewers have opined that {{the extended}} edition presents Faramir in a more favourable light.|$|E
5|$|On the {{south-western}} {{part of the}} fort, {{which is}} surrounded by hills on three sides, {{there is a small}} stream called the Kamadah Jheel which was used by the women of the royal family for their daily ablutions. Between this stream and the fort there are two watch towers (dom kilas) located on the hill top which were used to track any enemy intrusions. Of these <b>two</b> <b>towers,</b> one tower houses a small temple of a goddess called Devi Mandir.|$|E

5|$|The Lord of the Rings is a 1978 American-British {{animated}} high fantasy film {{directed by}} Ralph Bakshi. It is {{an adaptation of}} J. R. R. Tolkien's high fantasy epic The Lord of the Rings, comprising The Fellowship of the Ring and {{the first half of}} The <b>Two</b> <b>Towers.</b> Set in Middle-earth, the film follows a group of hobbits, elves, men, dwarves, and wizards who form a fellowship. They embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring made by the Dark Lord Sauron, and ensure his destruction.|$|E
5|$|The Rochefoucaulds, who {{had played}} a major role in the fight against the English, now began to ravish Angoulême. Charles VII returned, and this time {{destroyed}} the castle, largely by fire. However, the stones were recovered and the castle rebuilt. In 1446 the Rochefoucaulds managed to obtain the king's pardon and permission to build a defensive wall and <b>two</b> <b>towers</b> in Verteuil to restore the traditional refuge of the villagers. Under this pretext they made the castle among the best defended in France.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is similar}} to its {{predecessor}} in basic gameplay, but differs by adding multiple storylines, more playable characters and increased interaction with environments. A two-player co-op mode is also available for some missions. As with The <b>Two</b> <b>Towers,</b> The Return of the King was developed in close collaboration with the filmmakers, using many of the actual reference photos, drawings, models, props and other assets from the film. The game was met with positive critical reception for its graphics, audio, and gameplay, although its camera positioning and short length were criticized.|$|E
50|$|The {{tower was}} {{built as a}} {{replacement}} for their 599-meter tower near Hemingford, Nebraska, which collapsed in 2002, killing <b>two</b> <b>tower</b> workers and injuring three.|$|R
50|$|WGBF {{broadcasts}} from a <b>two</b> <b>tower</b> array {{near the}} intersection of Morgan Ave. and Burkhardt Road in Evansville. However, only one tower is used for daytime operation.|$|R

5|$|The <b>two</b> <b>towers</b> of Waterfalls {{impossible}} building are {{topped with}} compound polyhedra, one {{a compound of}} three cubes, the other a stellated rhombic dodecahedron known as Escher's solid. Escher had used this solid in his 1948 woodcut Stars, which also contains all five of the Platonic solids and various stellated solids, representing stars; the central solid is animated by chameleons climbing through the frame as it whirls in space. Escher possessed a 6cm refracting telescope and was a keen enough amateur astronomer to have recorded observations of binary stars.|$|E
5|$|Between 1142 and 1170 the Knights Hospitaller {{undertook}} a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was between <b>two</b> <b>towers</b> {{on the eastern}} side, {{and there was a}} postern gate in the northwest tower. At the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers. The lay of the land dictated the castle's irregular shape. A site with natural defences was a typical location for Crusader castles and steep slopes provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one, where the castle's defences were concentrated. This phase of building was incorporated into the later castle's construction.|$|E
5|$|Caesar's and Guy's Towers are {{residential}} {{and may have}} been inspired by French models (for example Bricquebec). Both towers are machicolated and Caesar's Tower features a unique double parapet. The <b>two</b> <b>towers</b> are also vaulted in stone on every storey. Caesar's Tower contained a grim basement dungeon; according to local legend dating back to at least 1644 it is also known as Poitiers Tower, either because prisoners from the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 may have been imprisoned there, or because the ransoms raised from the battle helped to pay for its construction. The gatehouse features murder holes, two drawbridges, a gate, and portcullises– gates made from wood or metal. The towers of the gatehouse were machicolated.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} span is of a seldom-built type, a self-anchored suspension bridge. It {{is unique}} in being both single tower and asymmetrical, a design tailored to the site. For ship channel clearance, the bridge would require at least one long span, while ready access to bedrock was found only close to Yerba Buena Island. A <b>two</b> <b>tower</b> cable-stayed design would require very deep tower footings, and a conventional <b>two</b> <b>tower</b> suspension bridge would additionally require a massive anchor {{to be built in}} deep bay mud. The curved nature of the approach places additional constraints upon the design.|$|R
