40|$|Abstract Background Treatment of {{ruptured}} Achilles tendons currently constitutes {{of conservative}} early functional treatment or surgical treatment either by open or minimal invasive techniques. We hypothesize that an experimental Achilles <b>tendon</b> <b>suture</b> in an animal model significantly deteriorates Achilles tendon microcirculation immediately following suturing. Methods Fifteen Achilles tendons of eight male Wistar rats (275 – 325 g) were included. After {{preparation of the}} Achilles tendon with a medial paratendinous approach, Achilles tendon microcirculation was assessed using combined Laser-Doppler and spectrophotometry (Oxygen-to-see) regarding: - tendinous capillary blood flow [arbitrary units AU] - tendinous tissue oxygen saturation [%] - tendinous venous filling pressure [rAU] The {{main body of the}} Achilles tendon was measured {{in the center of the}} suture with 50 Hz. 10 minutes after Achilles <b>tendon</b> <b>suture</b> (6 - 0 Prolene), a second assessment of microcirculatory parameters was performed. Results Achilles tendon capillary blood flow decreased by 57 % following the suture (70 ± 30 AU vs. 31 ± 16 AU; p Conclusion Achilles <b>tendon</b> <b>suture</b> in anaesthetised rats causes an acute loss of capillary perfusion and increases postcapillary venous filling pressures indicating venous stasis. The primary hypothesis of this study was confirmed. In contrast, tendinous tissue oxygen saturation remains unchanged excluding acute intratendinous hypoxia within the first 10 minutes after suture. Further changes of oxygen saturation remain unclear. Furthermore, it remains to be determined to what extent reduced capillary blood flow as well as increased postcapillary stasis might influence tendon healing from a microcirculatory point of view in this animal setting. </p...|$|E

30|$|Initially, the {{breaking}} force of tendon repair {{depends on the}} biomechanics of <b>tendon</b> <b>sutures.</b> Immobilized <b>tendon</b> <b>sutures</b> lose 50  % of their initial strength within the first week due to tenomalacia at the suture-tendon junction [8].

[11].|$|R

40|$|Today the {{statistical}} {{study on the}} edema of the tendon still remains in a state which requires further exploration. Therefore, by using a Mitamura's Abderhalden Dryer and Torsion-Balance, the author studied periodical changes of various edemas evoked by inflicting injuries to tendons, muscles, and skin of rabbits, and obtained the following results: 1. Of the Achilles tendon and long digital flexor <b>tendon</b> <b>sutured</b> groups, the edema both in the silk-thread group of the former and in the stainless-wire group of the latter {{was found to have}} reached its maximum stage around {{the end of the second}} week after operation, and it disappeared about the end of the sixth week. However, the degree of the edema is higher in the silkthread group than in the stainless-wire group. These findings coincide with microscopic ones. The normal water content of the Achilles tendon is about equal to that of the long digital flexor tendon when the Achilles tendon is severed. 2. Even in the case of severing the Achilles tendon, the edema reaches its maximum around the end of the second week after operation, and it practically disappears about the end of the sixth week. Likewise in the microscopic findings, the cellular substances are most abundant in the second week, showing an irregular inter-fiber spaces. These agree fairly well with the results obtained by Nakura and Takechi. 3. Changes of the edema evoked by pinching of the Achilles tendon, femur muscle, and femur skin take a similar course. The edema caused by the pinching of the musele and skin occurs more rapidly than that by the pinching of the tendon, especially markedly up to 24 hours after operation. 4.

40|$|A common distal radio-ulnar joint (DRUJ) {{stabilisation}} procedure uses a tendon graft {{running from}} {{the lip of the}} radial sigmoid notch to the ulnar fovea and through a bony tunnel to the ulnar shaft, before being wrapped round the distal ulna and sutured to itself. Such graft fixation can be challenging and requires a considerable tendon length. The graft length could be reduced by fixing the graft to the ulna using a bone anchor or interference screw. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the strength of three distal ulna graft fixation methods (<b>tendon</b> wrapping and <b>suturing,</b> bone anchor and interference screw). Four human cadaveric ulnae were used. A tendon strip was run through a tunnel in the distal ulna and secured by: (1) wrapping round the shaft and suturing it to itself, (2) a bone anchor and (3) an interference screw in the bone tunnel. Load to failure was determined using a custom-made apparatus and an Instron machine. Maximum failure load was highest for the bone anchor fixation (99. 3 [*]±[*] 23. 7  N) followed by the suturing (96. 2 [*]±[*] 12. 1  N), and the interference screw fixation (46. 9 [*]±[*] 5. 6  N).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare two four-strand techniques: the traditional Strickland and cruciate techniques.

The <b>sutured</b> <b>tendons</b> were subjected to constant progressive distraction using a universal testing machine (Kratos&# 174;).

40|$|Abstract Nickel-titanium {{shape memory}} metal Nitinol (NiTi) {{is a new}} kind of implant material, which {{provides}} a possibility to prepare functional implants activated at body temperature and withstands kinking better than conventional metals. Applications utilizing these unique properties are a target of active research interest. Host reactions to NiTi and to the forces created by functional implants should also be studied. A functional NiTi intramedullary nail, which causes a bending force on the bone, was developed for correcting bone deformities. In the present studies, the action of the device was inverted to induce a bone deformity instead of correcting one, in order to test the hypothesis that bone modelling can be controlled using such functional nail. Implanting the nail into the medullary cavity of rat femur for twelve weeks caused bowing of the bone, retardation of its longitudinal growth, and thickening of the bone and the cortex. In another study the effects of functional and straight nails were compared. Bowing of the bone and significant overall thickening of the bone and the cortex were associated only with the functional nail, while the straight nail induced only minor thickening of the bone. Retardation of longitudinal growth was seen in both groups, and this may have been caused by perforating the distal epiphyseal plate during the nailing. Finite element model of the bone-nail combination was also created. Porous NiTi was studied as a bone graft substitute by filling a bone defect in the distal femoral metaphysis of a rat bone with porous NiTi implants of different porosities. After 30 weeks, porosity of 66. 1 % (mean pore size (MPS) 259 μm) showed the best bone-implant contact (51 %). However, porosity of 46. 6 % (MPS 505 μm) with 39 % bone-implant contact was not significantly inferior in this respect and showed a significantly lower incidence of fibrosis within the implant and thus seemed to be the best choice for a bone graft substitute, out of the porosities tested here. The porosity of 59. 2 % (MPS 272 μm) showed lower contact values. NiTi <b>tendon</b> <b>suture</b> material was studied by implanting NiTi sutures into rabbit tendon and subcutaneous tissues for two, six, and twelve weeks. NiTi proved to be stronger than polyester, which served as control material. The encapsulating membrane was minimal with both materials, suggesting good biocompatibility in tendon tissue.

40|$|Background: Achilles tendon {{ruptures}} {{in humans}} might be treated more efficiently {{with the help}} of a growth factor. Cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein- 2 has been shown to induce formation of tendon-like tissue. Hypothesis: Cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein- 2 has a positive effect on mechanical parameters for tendon healing in a rabbit model with Achilles tendon transection. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: The right Achilles tendon of 40 rabbits was transected without <b>tendon</b> <b>suture.</b> Cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein- 2 (10 g) or vehicle control (acetate buffer) was injected locally 2 hours postoperatively. All tendons were tested biomechanically at 8 and 14 days, and treated tendons were histologically and radiographically evaluated at 56 days. Results: At 14 days, both failure load and stiffness of treated tendons were increased by 35 %. The treated tendons had significantly larger callus size at 8 and 14 days. Histologic and radiographic examination showed no signs of ossification in the treated tendons after 56 days. Conclusions: A single injection of cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein- 2 led to a stronger and stiffer tendon callus than that in the controls without inducing bone formation. Clinical Relevance: Similar results from a larger animal model would suggest a possible future use of cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein- 2 in the treatment of human Achilles tendon ruptures...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: In this work, we {{attempted}} to develop a modified single-knot Kessler-loop lock suture technique and compare the biomechanical properties associated with this single-knot suture technique with those associated with the conventional modified Kessler and interlock suture techniques. METHODS: In this experiment, a total of 18 porcine flexor digitorum profundus tendons were harvested and randomly divided into three groups. The tendons were transected and then repaired using three different techniques, including modified Kessler suture with peritendinous suture, interlock suture with peritendinous suture, and modified Kessler-loop lock suture with peritendinous suture. Times required for suturing were recorded and compared among groups. The groups were also compared with respect to 2 -mm gap load, ultimate failure load, and gap at failure. RESULTS: For tendon repair, compared with the conventional modified Kessler suture technique, the interlock and modified Kessler-loop lock suture techniques resulted in significantly improved biomechanical properties. However, {{there were no significant}} differences between the interlock and modified Kessler-loop lock techniques with respect to biomechanical properties, gap at failure, and time required. CONCLUSIONS: The interlock and modified Kessler-loop lock techniques for flexor <b>tendon</b> <b>sutures</b> produce similar mechanical characteristics in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We {{wanted to}} {{evaluate}} the results of arthroscopic management of an isolated rupture of the sub-scapularis <b>tendon</b> using <b>suture</b> anchors. Materials and Methods: Twenty nine patients with unilateral ruptures of the subscapularis tendon and who underwent arthroscopic repair between February 2001 and October 2007 were reviewed prospective-ly. All the cases were isolated tears of the subscapularis without the involvement of any other rotator cuff tendon. In 19 patients the tear was localized to the superior one third, in 7 cases the tear was localized to the upper two thirds and the entire tendon was involved in 3 cases. The mean follow up period was 12. 2 months (range: 6 - 26 months). The results of the treatment were assessed by evaluating the constant shoul-der score and the pain score before surgery and after surgery. Results: The constant shoulder score improved from 49. 9 ± 7. 3 to 73. 8 ± 3. 0 points compared to before surgery and the pain score improved from 4. 3 ± 3. 2 to 11. 2 ± 3. 0 points postoperatively. Conclusion: Arthroscopic repair of isolated ruptures of the subscapularis <b>tendon</b> using <b>suture</b> anchors is...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} gain closure o f the f lexor tendon sheath after tendon repair, onsideration {{is given to the}} method o f opening the sheath, its siting and the method of <b>tendon</b> <b>suturing.</b> Formerly, it was common {{practice}} to excise significant portions of the flexor tendon sheath at the time of primary flexor tendon repair, in the belief that healing of the tendon depended upon adhesions between it and the soft tissues outside the sheath (Potenza, 1962). It was then shown that such excision of the sheath, together with the presence of <b>sutures</b> in the <b>tendon</b> and immobilisation of the finger, (Matthews, 1976) rather than being beneficial were major factors in causing restrictive adhesions which eliminated tendon gliding and therefore digital motion. The ability of the flexor tendon to heal itself, which had previously been discounted, was established by demonstrations both of the relative profusion of the intrinsic blood supply (Caplan, 1975) and of the significance of synovial nutrition, was shown by Lundborg (1976, 1980 a. b. c) when he achieved healing of an isolated tendon in the synovial pouch of the knee of the rabbit. Manske (1978) proved tha...|$|R
