5|$|An {{unexpected}} {{bonus of}} the Bruneval raid was the Germans' {{efforts to improve}} defences at Würzburg stations and prevent similar attacks.

5|$|Another {{issue is}} that Murray cod caught and {{released}} in winter, while developing their eggs, or in spring prior to spawning, resorb their eggs and do not spawn. This may be a minor issue compared {{to some of the}} other threats facing Murray cod, nevertheless, concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild Murray cod at these times. At this point in time a closed season is in place for the spring spawning period, during which anglers are not allowed <b>to</b> <b>target</b> Murray cod, even on a catch and release basis.|$|E

5|$|Like other minks, {{individual}} sea minks {{may have}} maintained home ranges, and, since the males were larger and required more food, males {{would have had}} larger territorial claims.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of endowing the social parameter, autonomy, on a distributed sensor network used for surveillance of multiple targets that crisscross a rectangular surveillance zone. Crossing targets are ascribed priorities by a priority ascription scheme based on fuzzy inference methods. The scheme fuses local and global priorities of a target through the parameter autonomy that has values in [0, 1]. Sensors coordinate to allocate themselves <b>to</b> a particular <b>target.</b> Autonomy affects this process of allocation of sensors <b>to</b> <b>targets.</b> Lower autonomy biases allocation of sensors <b>to</b> <b>targets</b> that require short durations of tracking while higher autonomy biases allocation of sensors <b>to</b> <b>targets</b> that require longer tracking time. Test cases are presented regarding how changes in autonomy affect the tracking performance of the system. Conclusions are derived that suggest when high or low values of autonomy are beneficial to the system...|$|R

5|$|Mechanical gun games {{existed before}} the {{emergence}} of electronic video games, {{as far back as}} the 1920s. The first light guns appeared in the 1930s, with the Seeburg Ray-O-Lite. Games using this toy rifle were mechanical and the rifle fired beams of light at targets wired with sensors. These evolved throughout subsequent decades, culminating in games such as Sega's electro-mechanical arcade game Periscope, the company's first successful game, released in 1966. It required the player <b>to</b> <b>target</b> cardboard ships.|$|E
