Results revealed plastic zip-ties and quick-clamping couplers to reduce mean normalized muscle responses and support performance comparable to conventional metal-wire ties and ratcheting clamps.

In such a tube the viscosity and the thermal conductivity of the air, or any other fluid, can {{have a significant effect}} on the wave propagation. An important aspect is that due to the viscothermal wave propagation sound energy is being dissipated.

40|$|Abstract. A generic, heterotic {{string theory}} is uniquely {{reduced to the}} {{standard}} model {{in terms of a}} geometry that transcends compactification. This device also extends the standard model to embrace three generations of fermions, including a left-handed strange quark that is devoid of strangeness and three right-handed neutrinos. Finally, the proposed hypothesis indicates supergravitationally mediated quark-lepton transitions that preserve baryon structure, departing from the SUSY GUT tradition that predicts proton decay. 1. A Unique Reduction to the Standard Model The current status of high energy physics confronts two significant problems: that SUSY GUT theories predict a proton decay, which is not observed, and that heterotic string models (the only finite, physical models) of supergravity do not uniquely reduce to the standard model at SM scale. Both problems are addressed in terms of a geometry, which transcends compactification by preserving the geodesic nature of world <b>tube</b> <b>coupling.</b> A pure supergravitational transition at string scale is envisioned as an absorptionradiatio...|$|E
30|$|The solar {{receiver}} tube {{is the most}} important part of the PTC due to its thermal and optical performance. This performance depends on the solar absorber materials, the prevention of heat loss by the glass envelope tube, the distance between the glass tube and the absorber tube, and the coating materials used on the absorber tube [2]. In this prototype, the solar {{receiver tube}} consists of a SS tube coated with three different thicknesses of Ni–Al coating. A glass envelope tube is fitted over the absorber tube. There is a vacuum between the absorber and the glass envelope <b>tube.</b> <b>Coupling</b> joints (made of Teflon) are used to fit the glass envelope tube at both ends to achieve an airtight enclosure and maintain a vacuum inside the solar receiver tube. This is one of the more complicated parts of the construction process. The vacuum is maintained to achieve a high amount of thermal energy in the absorber and to prevent heat loss.|$|E
40|$|A local power utility’s injury {{database}} {{was analyzed}} to identify jobs with high injury rates for maintenance personnel. These jobs were analyzed for ergonomics-related hazards, first, using a subjective screening tool and then via a detailed quantitative {{analysis on the}} high risk jobs. This analysis revealed scaffold frame assembly tasks, including walk-board tie-down and frame <b>tube</b> <b>coupling</b> to pose high-risks. The {{purpose of this study}} was to (1) conceptualize ergonomic interventions with potential to reduce exposure to hazards for the two high-risk tasks; and (2) conduct experiments to assess the impact of the proposed interventions on muscle activation levels and task performance. The standard procedure adopted at the local utility for walk-board tie-down tasks involves use of a # 9 gauge metal wire to secure boards to a scaffold frame. Pre-cut wires are looped around the walk-boards and frame, and then tightened with pliers. An evaluation of this task revealed risk factors of high force, extreme postures and repetitious movements during plier use in tightening the metal wire. To reduce the effect of these problems, plastic zip-ties were proposed. For the scaffolding coupling task, standard ratchet couplers are used to secure tw...|$|E

40|$|A {{nuclear power}} plant is a complex {{operation}} requiring {{a large number of}} maintenance operations. Examination of a local power utility‟s injury database revealed that maintenance personnel had the highest injury incidence rates. Maintenance jobs were analyzed from an ergonomics perspective and scaffolding tasks, including walk-board tie-down to frames and frame <b>tube</b> <b>coupling,</b> were found to pose high risks. Ergonomic risks included excessive torques at joints and awkward posture positions in both tasks. The purpose of this research was to conceptualize interventions to reduce these risks and to conduct experiments to empirically assess the impact of the proposed interventions on worker posture and performance. The standard procedure for walk-board tie-down at the {{nuclear power plant}}s calls for the use of # 9 gauge wire. The wire is looped around a walk-board and a scaffolding tube, and then twisted with pliers to tighten.

In both cases, ET proceeded from Cu^+ to a Ru(bpy) _ 2 (im) ^(3 +) attached to the native His 83. In this otherwise native system, the Cu^+ Ru^(3 +) → Cu^(2 +) Ru^(2 +) rate is 1. 2 (1) × 10 ^ 6 s^(− 1) (−ΔG° = 0. 76 eV) (J. J. Regan, A. J. Di Bilio, R. Langen, L. K. Skov, J. R. Winkler, H. B.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} interest {{in the prevention of}} ignition sources within fuel tanks due to lightning currents induced in fuel and vent tubes and other conducting objects within fuel tanks. The SAE fuel system committee, SAE G- 3 A (Aerospace Couplings, Fittings, Hose & Tubing Assemblies) has drafted a proposed environmental test standard [i] for fuel tube couplers that includes conduction of typical lightning currents through fuel tube couplings to verify that no arcing occurs that could ignite flammable fuel vapors. This paper describes a plan of exploratory tests to determine the conditions under which flames will and will not propagate to the ends of pipes attached to coupling specimens of various sizes. An initial series of tests will be conducted by igniting a hydrogen gas mixture with a small spark at the interior of tube specimens of various diameters to determine the conditions that let the flame appear at the open end of the pipe. A second group of tests will be conducted on couplings attached to short tube ends and arranged to produce an arc that is exposed to the interior of the coupling when typical currents are conducted through the coupling. Such an arc would have a higher energy dissipation than the 0. 2 mJ spark often used to verify ignition sensitivity of flammable gasses, but most electrical arcs that might occur at fuel tube couplings would be significantly hotter, and more incendiary, than the standard 0. 2 mJ spark. Several test laboratories are expected to conduct the same tests on identical couplings. If these “round robin ” results are consistent, the results will be used to finalize the fuel <b>tube</b> <b>coupling</b> lightning test standard...|$|E
