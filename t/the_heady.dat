25|$|Along {{with his}} studies with Boulanger, Copland took classes in French {{language}} and {{history at the}} Sorbonne, attended plays, and frequented Shakespeare and Company, the English-language bookstore that was a gathering-place for expatriate American writers. Among this group in <b>the</b> <b>heady</b> cultural atmosphere of Paris in the 1920s were Paul Bowles, Ernest Hemingway, Sinclair Lewis, Gertrude Stein, and Ezra Pound, as well as artists like Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, and Amedeo Modigliani. Also influential on the new music were the French intellectuals Marcel Proust, Paul Valéry, Jean-Paul Sartre, and André Gide; the latter cited by Copland as being his personal favorite and most read. Travels to Italy, Austria, and Germany rounded out Copland's musical education. During his stay in Paris, Copland began writing musical critiques, the first on Gabriel Fauré, which helped spread his fame and stature in the music community.|$|E

Đính's ego had been played upon by the Ngô brothers, who had themselves reiterated this point and paid him a large cash bonus after the pagoda raids. In <b>the</b> <b>heady</b> times after the attacks, Đính had a [...] "somewhat incoherent" [...] debate with his American advisor, claiming [...] "he [...] was without doubt the greatest general officer in the ARVN, the saviour of Saigon... and soon he would be the top military man in the country."

500|$|At {{the time}} of the album's release, a press {{statement}} from Gil Friesen, the then President of A Records, read that, [...] "The whole industry has a stake in this success". Time magazine speculated that [...] "the fallout from Thriller has given the [...] business its best years since <b>the</b> <b>heady</b> days of 1978, when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of $4.1 billion". Time summed up Thrillers impact as a [...] "restoration of confidence" [...] for an industry bordering on [...] "the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop". The publication described Jackson's influence at that point as, [...] "Star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too".|$|E
500|$|Keith Caulfield from Billboard complimented the song's [...] "empowerment" [...] theme, {{adding that}} [...] "the song is a pulsing pop tune {{that has a}} {{positive}} universal message about believeing in yourself".

[...] While reviewing the album, Alan Braidwood from BBC called the song as [...] "lethally catchy" [...] {{and one of the}} album's highlights. Jennifer Vineyard from MTV noticed that [...] "Jump" [...] sounded like a sequel to Madonna's 1990 single [...] "Keep It Together". Jon Pareles of The New York Times in review of Confessions on a Dance Floor, wrote that Madonna's [...] "somber side sounds best in 'Jump', about the urge to move on". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented that the song is a [...] "gritty club anthem that wouldn't have sounded out of place on Erotica, showcases her lower register".

500|$|Songs of Experience was {{released}} in October 1969 by Capitol Records on stereo LP. In a retrospective review, AllMusic's Thom Jurek gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars and said that Axelrod [...] "succeeded in spades" [...] in his search for a sound that [...] "best exemplified not only his feelings but also <b>the</b> <b>heady</b> text he sought to sonically illustrate." [...] Jurek felt that his compositions were diverse, lush, and able to resemble literature by [...] "using as much space as they do sound for dramatic and dynamic effect", and that Axelrod created original palettes for rock instrumentation through his complex use of the horn section's [...] "various colors". Lynell George of the Los Angeles Times called it a [...] "prescient, genre-defying" [...] solo project, and NME viewed it as a [...] "landmark" [...] album. Mojo cited the album, along with Song of Innocence, as Axelrod's artistic peak and particularly praised [...] "The Human Abstract" [...] as [...] "beautiful and blank", evoking [...] "the view from Arthur Lee's castle of an endless pale blue sky and the vast deathly city beneath it." [...] Songs of Experience was reissued on CD in 2000 by EMI.|$|E
500|$|Carolyn Menyes of the Music Times named [...] "West Coast" [...] {{as one of}} her {{favorite}} Del Rey songs to-date, highlighting Auerbach's influence as what benefited it most. In her review, she went on to opine, [...] "Her voice plays off it well, too, and she actually feels passionate on this song, as opposed to her typical bored thing". While Caitlyn Carter, Joey DeGroot and Kyle Dowling of the same publication named it a stand-out on Ultraviolence. Kate Hutchinson of The Guardian called it [...] "one of the finest pop songs of the last five years". While Kitty Empire of the same publication wrote, [...] "The engaging West Coast improves on every hearing, a clever two-in-one track rich with detail, rhythm, atmospherics and class". Drowned in Sound's Robert Leedham said that with [...] "West Coast", Del Rey developed a song to [...] "trump" [...] "Video Games" [...] (2011), and a [...] "new found guttural swagger". Leedham also commended Del Rey's key changes, [...] "masterful" [...] sway from tension, and reverberation in the song. Scott T. Sterling of the CBS Corporation opined that the track expanded the dimensions of Del Rey's sound, and that it was [...] "one of the most distinctive hits of 2014". The Boston Globe writer James Reed commented, [...] "'West Coast' has a noirish sensuality, which opens into a chorus that mimicks <b>the</b> <b>heady</b> rush of a first toke".|$|E

[...] He wrote that [...] "Losts tradition of opening the year with a killer, capture-the-imagination sequence is honored and upheld, though the thing I loved most was how it was brazenly frank (and engagingly funny) about <b>the</b> <b>heady</b> high-concept conceit that will define the season." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety concluded that [...] "Lost … approaches its twists with {{what appears to be a}} greater degree of intellectual rigor than almost anything else on primetime. [...] Even when it's difficult to keep track of the myriad connections, a sense lingers that somebody knows—which is strangely reassuring." [...] Despite being more interested in the romantic aspirations of the show's characters, Jennifer Godwin of E! remarked that [...] "the Lost mythology is a miracle to behold. [...] It's grandiose, compelling, gaspworthy and, despite what the haters would have you believe, altogether satisfying". [...] Katherine Nichols of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin enjoyed the opening scene, [...] "but the rest of it didn't capture [...] as [...] hoped it would", citing high expectations due to the eight-month hiatus after the fourth season finale and a possible [...] "yearning for more character-driven stories over machinations revolving around time travel, however clever they might be." [...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV said that [...] "the opening scene itself will leave your mouth wide open and you'll probably forget to close it for a few minutes." [...] He also wrote the premiere episodes [...] "are vintage Lost, full of some unbelievable twists and a whole lot of groundwork". [...] H.T.
