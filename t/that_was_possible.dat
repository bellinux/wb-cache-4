5|$|The game is Barlow's first project {{since his}} {{departure}} from Climax Studios, {{after which he}} became independent. He wanted to develop a game that was dependent on the narrative, and avoided working on the game until he was settled on an idea <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to execute. Barlow eventually decided to create a police procedural game, and incorporate live action footage. He conducted research for the game by watching existing police interviews. Upon doing so, he discovered recurring themes in the suspects' answers, and decided to incorporate ambiguity to the investigation in the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1529 the Chuj city of San Mateo Ixtatán (then {{known by}} the name of Ystapalapán) was given in encomienda to the conquistador Gonzalo de Ovalle {{together}} with Santa Eulalia and Jacaltenango. In 1549, the first reduction of San Mateo Ixtatán took place, overseen by Dominican missionaries, in the same year the Q'anjob'al reducción settlement of Santa Eulalia was founded. Further Q'anjob'al reducciones were in place by 1560. Q'anjob'al resistance was largely passive, based on withdrawal to the inaccessible mountains and forests. In 1586 the Mercedarian Order built the first church in Santa Eulalia. The Chuj of San Mateo Ixtatán remained rebellious and resisted Spanish control for longer than their highland neighbours, resistance <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> owing to their alliance with the lowland Lakandon Ch'ol to the north.|$|E

5|$|The 15th Brigade {{embarked}} for the Western Front on 17 June 1916. Its first {{battle was}} the disastrous Battle of Fromelles. Despite his inexperience in trench warfare, {{he pointed out}} to Major H. C. L. Howard of Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig's British Expeditionary Force staff that the width of no-man's land was too great for the assault to succeed. Major Howard agreed and, on returning to Haig's Chateau, attempted to persuade him that the attack was doomed to fail. But the commander-in-chief decided that the operation must go on, so Elliott did all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> {{to make it a}} success by himself going to the front line to personally inspect the lie of the land and encourage his men. He soon realised that the attack had been a complete failure, reported to that effect, and established that he was now organising the defence of the original trenches. In the end, 1,804 of the 5,533 Australian casualties were from the 15th Brigade. For his part, Elliott was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, mentioned in despatches, and awarded the Russian Order of St Anna (3rd class, with swords).|$|E

Such proposals are considered too radical—and not legally permissible (in terms of halakha) -- by most orthodox leaders.|$|E
25|$|Rain ravaged {{the match}} between Somerset and Lancashire {{allowing}} little {{play on the}} first three days. Between the showers, Lancashire had Somerset at 48 for 2 on the first day, but the little play <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> after that gave Mike Burns (87) and Sanath Jayasuriya (72 not out after three days) opportunity to increase the score to 195 for 3 on day 3. A draw looked more than likely, even if the sides would agree to forfeiting an innings. The fourth day was {{a full day of}} cricket, and Muttiah Muralitharan took five for 56 for Lancashire as they bowled Somerset out for 294. Iain Sutcliffe then lifted Lancashire to four batting points and 351 for 3 declared with his 150, well helped by an unbeaten century from Australian Brad Hodge.|$|E

25|$|The first Test at Lord's {{was heavily}} {{affected}} by rain and drawn, batting was {{difficult in the}} play <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> and Pakistan were dismissed for 87 in their first innings. England in response scored 117/9 declared with Fazal and Khan Mohammad bowling throughout the innings, Fazal recording figures of 4/54. In the tour match before the next Test Pakistan played Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, the tourists won by eight wickets with Fazal taking 11 wickets including a then career best 8/66 in the first innings. The second Test was at the same venue but saw contrasting fortunes as the Pakistanis suffered a heavy innings defeat and Fazal recorded his worst Test figures of 0/148. Although he was suffering with a leg injury which forced him to shorten his run-up. Pakistan faced another innings defeat {{after three days of}} the third Test but the match was drawn after rain stopped any play on the final two days, Fazal took 4/107 from 42 overs in England's innings.|$|E
25|$|There {{were greater}} delays at Mike sector; the guns of B Trp landed at 16.15 {{and went into}} action on the beach because the dunes and {{approaches}} were mined. Their crews helped to rescue men from burning landing craft {{at the edge of}} the water. A Troop's guns were in the process of landing at 19.00 when they engaged a Junkers Ju 88 attacking the landing craft – the only daylight attack on Juno during D-Day. RHQ reported 24 Bofors and 12 x 20mm of 'O' AA Assault Group ashore by 19.00. In the absence of HAA guns and their radar or of searchlights, which had been unable to land, uncontrolled barrages by the LAA guns were all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> during the night, but no concentrated attack occurred. Additional Troops of 114th LAA Rgt landed on D+1 as air attacks began to increase, peaking on D+3.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{these early}} stages of development, much of the {{understanding}} of the fusion process was the result of computer simulations, primarily LASNEX. LASNEX greatly simplified the reaction to a 2-dimensional simulation, which was all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> given the amount of computing power at the time. According to LASNEX, laser drivers in the kJ range would have the required properties to reach low gain, which was just within the state of the art. This led to the Shiva laser project which was completed in 1977. Contrary to predictions, Shiva fell far short of its goals, and the densities reached were thousands of times smaller than predicted. This was traced to issues with the way the laser delivered heat to the target, which delivered most of its energy to electrons rather than the entire fuel mass. Further experiments and simulations demonstrated that this process could be dramatically improved by using shorter wavelengths of laser light.|$|E

500|$|With {{the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution and the growing use of steam power, there was a rapid {{increase}} in the demand for coal. [...] The Duke's mines were among those supplying the surrounding districts but transport was both inefficient and expensive, and the mines also suffered from persistent flooding. His solution to these problems was to build a canal from Worsley to Salford, and an underground canal into the mines from Worsley Delph. [...] The canal boats would carry [...] at a time,– more than ten times the amount of cargo per horse <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> with a cart.

500|$|At a {{much later}} date, {{members of the}} team decided to remake Innocence, as fan {{feedback}} had pointed out many features they had wanted to include despite putting all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> into Innocence. Controlling the characters using the PlayStation Vita's touch screen was included for ease of play, although gameplay features using the Vita's other functions was considered during development. Innocence R was developed by Japanese developer 7th Chord. Innocence R was a ground-up remake, with the [...] "R" [...] in the title standing for [...] "re-imagination", referring to the team's development wish for the gameplay and story. Everything from the coding to the animation was redone. The team hoped that the game would provide a boost to the sales of its prospective platform. Inomata returned in her role as character designer for the new characters, while Mika Murakita joined Odate as a producer. New opening and in-game anime cutscenes were created by Production I.G. Development overlapped with the Vita remake of Hearts, with staff from Innocence R also working on Hearts R.|$|E

500|$|Sega {{argued that}} Accolade had infringed upon its {{copyrights}} because Accolade's games contained Sega's material. [...] Accolade insisted that {{their use of}} Sega's material constituted fair use. [...] However, Judge Caulfield did not accept this explanation since Accolade was a game manufacturer, their works were for financial gain, and because their works competed directly with Sega's licensed games, likely resulting in a sales decrease for Sega's games. [...] Accolade's case was further hurt by a presentation by a Sega engineer named Takeshi Nagashima, who showed two Sega game cartridges that were able to run on the Genesis III without the trademark-displaying TMSS, and offered them to Accolade's defense team but would not reveal how <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible.</b> [...] Ultimately, this would result in Accolade's defeat on April 3, 1992, when Judge Caulfield {{ruled in favor of}} Sega and issued an injunction prohibiting future sales by Accolade of Genesis-compatible games incorporating the Sega message or using the results of the reverse engineering. [...] Almost a week later, Accolade was also required by the court to recall all of their Genesis-compatible games.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} get the feel of an actual documentary, the {{producers}} hired cinematographer Randall Einhorn, who is known for directing episodes of Survivor, which allowed the show to have the feel of [...] "rough and jumpy" [...] like an actual documentary. According to producer Michael Schur, the producers to the series would follow the documentary format strictly. The producers would have long discussions over whether a scene could work under the documentary format. For example, in the fourth-season episode [...] "Did I Stutter?," [...] a scene featured Michael going through a long process {{to go to the bathroom}} and not pass by Stanley. The producers debated whether <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> and Einhorn walked through the whole scene in order to see if a camera man could get to all the places in time to shoot the whole scene. Despite the strict nature in the early years of the series, later seasons seem to have loosened the rules on the format, with the camera crew often going into places that actual documentary crews would not, which also changed the writing and comedy-style of the series. This inconsistency has received criticism from critics and fans.|$|E
500|$|Her Story was {{developed}} by Sam Barlow, who previously worked on games such as [...] (2007) and [...] (2009) at Climax Studios. Barlow had conceived {{the idea of a}} police procedural game while working at Climax Studios, but decided to become independent to create the game, in order to develop a game that is [...] "deep on story". He became frustrated by publishers using kitchen sink realism as the reason behind rejecting game pitches, and found that becoming independent allowed him to create his own game of the sort. He also wished to become independent after playing games like Year Walk (2013) and 80 Days (2014). Barlow avoided development until he had an idea <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to execute. [...] "I could probably quite easily have gone and made an exploration horror game ... but I kind of knew that there would be big compromises there because of budget," [...] he said. Barlow spent his savings to work on the game, allowing him a year of development time. He followed through with the concept of Her Story, as it focused on an [...] "intimate setting, dialogue and character interaction", which he found was often dismissed in larger titles. Barlow felt particularly inspired to develop Her Story after seeing the continuous support of his 1999 game Aisle. When referring to how Her Story challenges typical game conventions, Barlow compares it to the Dogme 95 filmmaking movement, and Alfred Hitchcock's 1948 film Rope.|$|E
