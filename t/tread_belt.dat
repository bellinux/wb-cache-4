40|$|The NASA Crawler/Transporters (CT- 1 and CT- 2) used to {{transport}} the Space Shuffles {{are one of the}} largest tracked vehicles in existence today. Two of these machines have been used to move space flight vehicles at Kennedy Space Center since the Apollo missions of the 1960 's and relatively few modifications have been made to keep them operational. In September of 2003 during normal Crawler/Transporter operations cracks were observed along the roller pad surfaces of several <b>tread</b> <b>belt</b> shoes. Further examination showed 20 cracked shoes on CT- 1 and 40 cracked shoes on CT- 2 and a formal failure analysis investigation was undertaken while the cracked shoes were replaced. Six shoes were cross-sectioned with the fracture surfaces exposed and it was determined that the cracks were due to fatigue that initiated on the internal casting web channels at pre-existing casting defects and propagated through thickness both transgranularly and intergranularly between internal shrinkage cavities, porosity, and along austenitic and ferritic grain boundaries. The original shoes were cast during the 1960 's using a modified 861330 steel with slightly higher levels of chromium, nickel and molybdenum followed by heat treatment to achieve a minimum tensile strength of 11 Oksi. Subsequent metallurgical analysis of the <b>tread</b> <b>belt</b> shoes after multiple failures showed excessive internal defects, alloy segregation, a nonuniform ferritic/ bainitic/martensitic microstructure, and low average tensile properties indicative of poor casting and poor heat-treatment. As a result, NASA funded an initiative to replace all of the <b>tread</b> <b>belt</b> shoes on both crawler/transporters along with a redesign of the alloy, manufacturing, and heat-treatment to create a homogeneous cast structure with uniform mechanical and metallurgical properties. ME Global, a wholly owned subsidiary of ME Elecmetal based in Minneapolis, MN was selected as manufacturing and design partner to develop the new shoes and this paper describes the research, development, and manufacturing that resulted in the successful delivery of 1044 new Crawler/Transporter <b>tread</b> <b>belt</b> shoes all meeting rigid metallurgical and mechanical design criteria derived from finite element modeling of the stress loads required for safe space shuttle transport...|$|E
40|$|Analyses of {{real-world}} tire <b>tread</b> <b>belt</b> detachment and/or sudden {{air loss}} events {{as well as}} vehicle testing of those events have been presented in scientific literature since the 1990 ’s. These confirm that such tire failures are complex and semi-random events that produce numerous sensory feedback cues to real-world drivers. These analyses further demonstrate that vehicles representing a full spectrum of steering characteristics are typically controllable and are controlled by drivers both {{during and after the}} tire disablement event. In 2003, the National Highway Traffic Administration (NHTSA) sponsored a study using the National Advanced Driving Simulator (NADS) to evaluate the technical hypothesis that there is a correlation between vehicle linear range understeer gradient and the likelihood of control loss when subject drivers experience a simulated <b>tread</b> <b>belt</b> detachment. The NADS subjects “drove” three simulated “vehicles” with different understeer gradients in a simulated tread separation even. The study’s authors reached conclusions regarding the drivers’ ability to control the “vehicles” which were inconsistent with real-world research. This paper presents an analysis of the NADS study performed to identify possible causes of the conflicting results and provides commentary upon several deficiencies noted in the NADS vehicle/tire modeling and validation. A more comprehensive understanding of the reported driver reactions when viewed in light of real vehicle experiments, real-world data, and an understanding of the limitations of the simulations is provided...|$|E
50|$|Tank treads - Numerous combat robots {{have used}} <b>treads</b> or <b>belts</b> {{in place of}} wheels {{in an attempt to}} gain {{additional}} traction. Treads are generally heavier and more vulnerable to damage than a wheeled system and offer no particular traction advantage on the types of surfaces common in robot combat. Most uses of treads are for their striking appearance. The Robot Wars competitors 101 and Mortis along with the BattleBots super heavyweight Ronin used treads. Biteforce, the winner of the 2015 Battlebots Competitions, used magnets embedded in its treads in an attempt to gain extra downforce without extra weight.|$|R
40|$|The strain {{amplitude}} dependency, i. e. the Fletcher-Gent effect and Payne effect, and the strain rate dependency of rubber with reinforcing fillers is modelled using a modified boundary surface model and implemented uniaxially. In this thesis, a split of strain instead of stress is utilized, and the storage and loss modulus are captured {{over two decades}} of both {{strain amplitude}}s and frequencies. In addition, experimental results from bimodal excitation are replicated well, even though material parameters were obtained solely from harmonic excitation. These results are encouraging since the superposition principle is not valid for filled rubber, and real-life operational conditions in general contain several harmonics. This means that formulating constitutive equations in the frequency domain is a cumbersome task, and therefore the derived model is implemented in the time domain. Filled rubber is used irreplaceable in several engineering solutions, such as tires, bushings, vibrations isolators, seals and <b>tread</b> <b>belts,</b> {{to name just a}} few. In certain applications, it is sufficient to model the elastic properties of a component during finite strains. However, Hooke’s law is inadequate for this task. Instead, hyperelastic material models are used. Finally, the thesis presents a methodology for obtaining the required material parameters utilizing experiments in pure shear, uniaxial tension and the inflation of a rubber membrane. It is argued that the unloading curve rather than the loading curve is more suitable for obtaining these parameters, even at very low strain rates. QC 20140917 </p...|$|R
50|$|After so {{many changes}} in the prior year, it is no {{surprise}} that there were few changes for 1970. Most US makes including Chrysler adopted bias belted tires. They were a short-lived hybrid that combined familiar soft riding bias body plies with <b>tread</b> stabilizing <b>belts</b> used in European style radial tires. One well known brand name at the time was Goodyear’s Polyglas. All 1970 Chryslers featured standard bias belted tires, with Town & Country wagons wearing size J78-15. J identified the second largest size available in load capacity, 78 indicated a cross-section height-to-width, or aspect ratio of 78%, and 15 being the nominal rim diameter in inches, as before.|$|R
5000|$|Radial tire {{construction}} utilizes body ply cords {{extending from the}} beads and across the tread so that the cords are laid at approximately right angles to the centerline of the tread, and parallel to each other, as well as stabilizer belts directly beneath the <b>tread.</b> The <b>belts</b> may be cord or steel. The advantages of this construction include longer tread life, better steering control, fewer blowouts, improved fuel economy, and lower rolling resistance. Disadvantages of the radial tire are a harder ride at low speeds on rough roads and {{in the context of}} off-roading, decreased [...] "self-cleaning" [...] ability and lower grip ability at low speeds.|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} wear {{represents}} {{a very important}} role in the functionality of most products. The description of the wear process for very heavily strained rubber products, for instance off-road tire <b>treads,</b> conveyor <b>belts</b> for stone transport etc., is very essential. Sharp edges of stones and terrain roughness gradually cut (chip) off rubber parts. This wear considerably damages separate parts of the product and destroy it. In technical terminology, we call this type of wear CHIP ? CHUNK effect. High-speed video camera, enabling recording and evaluation of the behaviour of ceramic tool when dropped on the surface of revolving testing rubber sample, was used for detailed analysis of the wear process.

40|$|Modeling truck tyre for {{the needs}} of {{prediction}} of tyre-road noise over a wide frequency range is investigated. An existing 3 -D tyre model based on two coupled orthotropic elastic layers is studied. It is applied for truck tyres. The model considers the tyre as made of two layers - <b>tread</b> and <b>belt.</b> They are under high tension due to the inflation pressure. The geometry of the tyre is represented as a plate with uniform thickness. In the width it includes the sidewalls and the belt of the tyre. Derivation of material properteis for the model based on measurements of point and transfer mobility is done. The influence of the measurement set-up to the results is discussed also. At the end, discussion of the results and conclusions are made...|$|R
50|$|The Pirelli Cinturato may be {{compared}} to a wheel in which the rim {{is attached to the}} hub by means of fine spokes. The <b>tread</b> and <b>belt</b> are in effect the rim; the 90-degree or radial cord plies are the spokes; and the bead is the hub. The inextensible belt and the radial casing cords were the combined factors which gave the Cinturato tyre its special properties.The different geometric arrangement of the Cinturato carcass resulted in greater deformation (bulging) {{in the area of the}} tyre section which is under load, as opposed to previous radial tyres of the period. This caused no disadvantage and did not result in greater tyre casing fatigue. Rather than having the dynamic wave form behind the road contact area, it instead formed on the side wall, increasing stability whilst also allowing the heat generated by cornering and braking to be easily dispersed.|$|R
50|$|First {{developed}} in 1952 {{under the name}} Pirelli Cintura, taking the name Cinturato in 1963, the tyre was composed {{of two or three}} carcass plies of cords laid at an angle of 90 degrees to the beads, and a belt of several plies laid circumferentially under the <b>tread.</b> Without a <b>belt,</b> the 90-degree plies would produce a casing which would greatly increase its sectional height on inflation. The belt, being inextensible, prevented the casing increasing in height when inflated, and the inflated tyre maintained almost the same dimensions as in the mould in which it went through vulcanisation. The belt was kept under tension, and the tread retained its flatter profile even when the tyre was inflated.|$|R
50|$|Total {{production}} was around 8100000 MT in 2006. Global consumption of Carbon Black, estimated at 13.2 {{million metric tons}} valued at US$13.7 billion in 2015, {{is expected to reach}} 13.9 million metric tons equated to US$14.4 billion in 2016 and further forecast to maintain a CAGR of 5.6% between 2016 and 2022 to reach 19.2 million metric tons equalent of US$20.4 billion by 2022. The most common use (70%) of carbon black is as a pigment and reinforcing phase in automobile tires. Carbon black also helps conduct heat away from the <b>tread</b> and <b>belt</b> area of the tire, reducing thermal damage and increasing tire life. Carbon black particles are also employed in some radar absorbent materials used in the reduction of the radar cross-section of aircraft and in photocopier and laser printer toner, and other inks and paints. The high tinting strength and stability of carbon black has also provided use in coloring of resins and films. About 20% of world production goes into belts, hoses, and other non-tire rubber goods. The balance is mainly used as a pigment in inks, coatings and plastics. For example, it is added to polypropylene because it absorbs ultraviolet radiation, which otherwise causes the material to degrade.|$|R
40|$|The {{in-plane}} {{phenomena of}} interaction between the tyre structural response and contact force generation are investigated in this work. The challenges of the physical tyre simulation are identified, primarily associated with the computational load imposed {{by the need to}} capture the space distributed mechanisms that prescribe the above interaction. The method of modal expansion and reduction is proposed for the moderation of this load. The theoretical framework for the transformation of a tyre modal representation into a transient contact and shear force generation model is developed. Various modelling approaches are examined with regards to their modal prediction characteristics. Linear and non linear structural features as well as the physical properties that define the broad range modal behaviour are identified. A discretised form of the ring model is derived and combined with a foundation of viscoelastic tread elements for simulating the transient contact behaviour of the tyre. The resulting pattern of the modes' excitation justifies the validity of the modal reduction method and reveals the relative importance of various mechanisms and physical properties in tyre contact behaviour. The interaction between the friction controlled shear slip of the <b>tread,</b> the <b>belt</b> compliance and the sidewall buckling is found to be reflected on the two-dimensional contact pressure distribution patterns. A method able to simulate the dynamic transient rolling and slipping operating conditions is developed, although the small displacement assumption of the modal approach is dropped. The method, which is based on the combined modal-time and space-time domain solutions, is applied on the study of the physical mechanism of the launch process. The examination of the model under steady state kinematic conditions reveals the saturation of the traction force for profound levels of slip, which highlights the contribution of the structural mechanisms on the macroscopically observed shear force performance of the tyre. The variation of the modes' level of excitation, as induced by the operating conditions, is proposed for the capture of the physical properties effect on tyre behaviour and performance.

40|$|Predicting tyre/road {{interaction}} processes like stick-slip and stick-snap {{and their}} resulting tyre/road noise requires {{detailed information about}} the road surface and {{the dynamics of the}} tread at the interface. Inertial effects in the tread layer are neglected in many of the existing tyre/road interaction models without explicit justification. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the potential importance of these effects for the case of a tread material indenting a rough road surface in the normal direction. A comprehensive numerical contact model operating in the time-domain which includes the effects of interfacial details is used for this purpose. Contact forces at the surface of the tread and at the interface between the <b>tread</b> and the <b>belt</b> are studied in the normal direction during the simulated loading. The inertial case, with a tread impulse response extending in time, is compared with the non-inertial case where the corresponding quasi-static response is used. Results show that the difference in contact force and contact stiffness between a quasi static and a dynamic simulation is small for loading rates that could be found in typical tyre/road contact conditions. Only for extremely high loading rates is there a significant difference. This work implies that inertial effects of the tread are negligible for the local tread response when simulating normal tyre/road contact situations...|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of}} the influence of material damping properties on the prediction of the road texture and tread pattern contribution to rolling resistance is presented. It is well known that rolling resistance {{is directly related to the}} tyre material damping and increases as the internal damping in the tyre increases. However, it is unclear what the accuracy of the material damping should be when the goal is to predict the (relative) effect of road texture and tread pattern on rolling resistance. Recently a FEM-based modeling approach to predict the road texture influence on the rolling resistance of pneumatic tyres has been proposed. In this approach the total rolling resistance is approximated as the sum of two components: smooth road rolling resistance and road texture induced rolling resistance. In the present paper the influence of material damping on both components of the predicted rolling resistance will be studied. The steady-state rolling resistance is obtained using the ’Steady State Transport’ algorithm in the software package Abaqus. The viscoelastic rubber properties are modeled using a second order Prony series and the coefficients are varied to represent a realistic range for tyres. The road texture induced rolling resistance depends on both the <b>belt</b> and <b>tread</b> damping. The <b>belt</b> damping is modeled as Rayleigh damping and the tread damping as frequency independent (viscous) damping. Measured road texture profiles are used as an input to study the combined influence of road texture and tread pattern on rolling resistance...|$|R
