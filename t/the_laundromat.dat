5|$|The second plot of {{the episode}} {{revolves}} around Jerry; when he prepares to go to <b>the</b> <b>laundromat,</b> Kramer asks him to take his laundry with him. Jerry agrees after some reluctance, insisting that their clothes remain segregated. After retrieving the laundry the following day and returning Kramer's portion, Jerry remembers that he had hidden a large sum of money in his laundry bag, but is unable to find it. The owner of <b>the</b> <b>laundromat</b> (John Capodice), tells him {{that he did not}} see the money, but also points out that he is not responsible for valuables. Kramer and Jerry both assume Vic stole the money and Kramer comes {{up with a plan to}} put cement mix in one of Vic's washing machines as revenge. Once they have acted out the plan, Kramer discovers that he had the money all along; and it turns out to be just enough to cover the damage to the washing machine.|$|E

25|$|Speck had frequented Frank's Place, and {{the empty}} hog house {{was one of several}} he had helped build in the {{preceding}} month, so Monmouth police briefly questioned him about Pierce's death when he showed up to collect his final carpentry paycheck on April 15 and asked him to stay in town for further questioning.

500|$|... "The Revenge" [...] {{was first}} {{read by the}} cast of the show on February 13, 1991 and was filmed {{in front of a}} live {{audience}} on February 20, 1991. Filming of the episode had been delayed two days due to President's Day. Both Alexander and Louis-Dreyfus praised the scene in which Jerry and George discuss the types of employment George could apply for after he quit his job. Louis-Dreyfus stated she was jealous that she was not in the scene. A number of scenes in the episode were removed prior to broadcast, such as one in which George and Kramer meet in the hallway and Kramer informs George that Jerry has gone to <b>the</b> <b>laundromat.</b> The writers decided that George could just say Kramer told him Jerry was at <b>the</b> <b>laundromat</b> and, upon that addition, the scene was cut. Initially, during Jerry and George's conversation about jobs, George mentions Regis Philbin, when they discuss George being a talk show host. Additional dialogue between George and Jerry at <b>the</b> <b>laundromat</b> was also removed. Because the episode [...] "The Stranded" [...] did not air until mid season three, the few references [...] "The Revenge" [...] contained to the episode, were cut. The Newman subplot was significantly reduced; the character initially appeared in one scene, but it was never filmed. In that scene, he would have explained to Jerry and Kramer that he jumped from the roof, but an awning broke his fall, though Jerry and Kramer would remain skeptical. The episode also involved the second appearance of Harold the building superintendent, who had previously appeared in [...] "The Apartment". Harold would inform the main characters that Newman made up the story about the awning breaking his fall, though, with the reduction of the Newman subplot, the scene was removed.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{positively}} received, with critics commending the song's delivery and {{comparing it to}} pop-R songs by Chris Brown and Rihanna. It was a success in the United States and Canada, Bieber's highest peaks in the countries at sixteen and ten, respectively, until [...] "Baby" [...] bested the record in 2010. It also charted in the Belgium (Flanders) tip chart and in Germany within the top thirty, and also charted in Austria, Australia, and United Kingdom. The music video features Bieber attracted to a girl he sees in <b>the</b> <b>laundromat,</b> as he leads her on a scavenger hunt to win a date with her. Bieber has performed the song {{in a number of}} live appearances including the Fearless Tour, The Next Star, and Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest.|$|E

500|$|Commentators had a mixed {{reaction}} to the choice of Kelly as Nivea's duet partner. Nicole James of Fuse ranked [...] "Laundromat" [...] {{as one of the}} top six most random Kelly collaborations. While James cast doubt on the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>laundromat</b> as a metaphor, she pointed to Kelly's vocal performance during the chorus as the song's highlight. However, Laura Checkoway viewed the [...] "banter between the barely legal Nivea and Kelly [...] unsettling" [...] because of the allegations that he had sexual relationships with girls under the age of consent. Echoing this thought, writer Mark Anthony Neal agreed with Checkoway's assessment in his 2010 article [...] "Bringing Up Daddy: A Black Feminist Fatherhood". Neal wrote that he was uncomfortable with the thought of taking his daughter to concerts that included [...] "music written and produced by a man accused of having sexual relations with underage women".|$|E
500|$|Although Newman's {{appearance}} was ultimately {{cut from the}} episode, auditions were held for the role; Tim Russ, who {{would go on to}} star in , auditioned, as did William Thomas, Jr., known for his appearance on The Cosby Show, who was cast in the part. Newman does share a brief dialogue with Kramer {{at the end of the}} episode, David recorded the lines, though he was not credited. The show's writing staff did not intend to have the character return in any later seasons, but because the idea of having actor Wayne Knight as a neighbor appealed to them, they re-cast Knight in the role of Newman for the season 3 episode [...] "The Suicide". Afterwards, Knight re-recorded Newman's lines for the syndicated version of this episode to establish better continuity. Both Knight's and David's dialogue were included on the Seinfeld: Volume 1 DVD boxset. Additionally, Fred Applegate guest-starred as George's boss and John Capodice portrayed Vic, <b>the</b> <b>laundromat</b> owner. Deck McKenzie, who worked as Seinfeld's stand-in, portrayed George's colleague Bill. Teri Austin portrayed Ava, a co-worker of George's; she would appear again later in [...] "The Stranded", which was filmed as part of season two, but aired as part of season three. Patrika Darbo, who played George's co-worker Glenda, would reappear later in the season five episode [...] "The Sniffing Accountant" [...] as a woman Newman flirts with.|$|E
500|$|In {{the music}} video, Bieber is {{attracted}} {{to a girl}} (Grace Marie Wilson) he sees every day washing clothes at the local laundromat. In the opening scenes, Bieber is wearing a green hooded sweatshirt, similar to the gray one he wore in the [...] "One Time" [...] video, along with a cranberry shirt. One day while he is waiting for his clothes and is tuning his guitar, she drops a scarf, and he picks it up. In <b>the</b> <b>laundromat</b> scene Bieber is wearing a mixed purple, blue & orange plaid collared shirt, with a dark purple tee. The girl comes {{back the next day}} however he is not there. He then posts a sign beside the washer that he found her missing scarf. He leads the girl on a scavenger hunt for the scarf, posting signs with pictures of him on them around the town to encourage her to go on a date with him. He takes pictures of him in situations such as buying chocolate for her and the puppies scene, and others, with notes doting quips of what he would do for her. During the date and ending scenes Bieber has on a white striped collared shirt, with a dark cyan tee. She finally finds him {{at the end of the}} video, and they have their date.|$|E

2500|$|For {{independent}} bookmakers, Dragna {{would use}} extortion to collect money from their operations. While most mobsters simply threatened harm {{on a business}} for not paying tribute to their organization (protection racket), Dragna’s family {{came up with a}} more sophisticated course of action. Dragna would send in men to threaten businesses, then the owners would pay Dragna for protection (unaware that these were Dragna's own men). Dragna wasn't however, able to control 100% of independent gambling rackets. Along with Dragna avoiding the spotlight and public life, he often was given the reputation as a weak ruler. According to Mickey Cohen, Dragna was very powerful and very well respected, but did not put things together the way the East Coast bosses preferred. Although there was not as big a pool of Italians to recruit on the West Coast like there was back East, the L.A. family worked around this by accepting members from across the country, such as Johnny Roselli from Chicago, Nick Licata from Detroit, and Aladena [...] "Jimmy the Weasel" [...] Fratianno and Dominic Brooklier from Cleveland. Armed with top hitman Frank Bompensiero and Jimmy Fratianno (who committed over 30 murders on the orders of their superiors), Dragna muscled his way into controlling territory stretching throughout California and Southern Nevada. The Dragna family also had connections within the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, who were more corrupt than the city police (LAPD). Although not having a big hand in labor union rackets, the Dragna crime family did infiltrate some unions in <b>the</b> <b>laundromat</b> and dress importing business.|$|E
