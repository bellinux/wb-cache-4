40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore whether the Open Directory (or DMOZ) {{can be used to}} {{classify}} queries into topical categories on different levels and whether we can use this topical context to improve retrieval performance. We have set up a user study to let test persons explicitly classify queries into topical categories. Categories are either chosen freely from DMOZ, or from a list of suggestions created by several automatic topic categorization techniques. The results of this user study show that DMOZ categories are suitable for topic categorization. Either free search or evaluation of a list of suggestions can be used to elicit the topical context. Free search leads to more specific <b>topic</b> <b>categories</b> than the list of suggestions. Different test persons show moderate agreement between their individual judgments, but broadly agree on the initial levels of the chosen categories. When we use the <b>topic</b> <b>categories</b> selected by the free search as topical context, this leads to significant improvements over the baseline retrieval results. The more general <b>topic</b> <b>categories</b> selected from the suggestions list, and top level categories do not lead to significant improvements. 1...|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} advance of {{information}} technologies, human beings increasingly rely on computers to accumulate, process, and {{make use of}} data. Knowledge discovery techniques have been proposed to automatically search large volumes of data for patterns. Group Support Systems (GSS) {{play an important role}} in streamlining group activities and improving group outcomes. Various attempts have been made to help automate several tasks in group activities under GSS environment. One of the approaches is to apply automatic approach to idea organization task in GSS. This research designed and tested an SVD-enabled system to automate the idea organization task in GSS. Specifically, this research was conducted to examine how the idea organization task, typically regarded as the most labor-intensive and cognitively demanding in group problems solving, can be automated using a system enabled by singular value decomposition techniques. For the purpose of evaluation, we compared the performance of our automated approach using SVD algorithm against that of human subjects. Two separate experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the automatic approach on two essential components of an idea organization; namely, generation of <b>topic</b> <b>categories</b> and placement of relevant comments into their respective categories. The general conclusion that can be made from this research is that idea organization in group problem solving can be facilitated both efficiently and effectively with the SVD-enabled system that can automatically generate <b>topic</b> <b>categories</b> and place relevant comments into their respective <b>topic</b> <b>categories.</b> Therefore, our automatic approach may provide a useful and promising tool for the idea organization task in GSS...|$|R

40|$|Research in Information Retrieval (IR) {{seeks to}} develop methods which better assist users in finding {{information}} which {{is relevant to}} their current information needs. Personalization is a significant focus of research {{for the development of}} next generation of IR systems. Commercial search engines are exploring methods to incorporate models of the user’s interests to facilitate personalization in IR to improve retrieval effectiveness. However, in some situations there may be no opportunity to learn about the interests of a specific user on a certain topic. This is a significant challenge for IR researchers attempting to improve search effectiveness by exploiting user search behaviour. We propose a solution to this problem based on recommender systems (RSs) in a novel IR model which combines a recommender model with traditional IR methods to improve retrieval results for search tasks, where the IR system has no opportunity to acquire prior information about the user’s knowledge of a domain for which they have not previously entered a query. We use search behaviour data from other previous users to build <b>topic</b> <b>category</b> models based on topic interests. When a user enters a query on a topic which is new to this user, but related to a topical search category, the appropriate <b>topic</b> <b>category</b> model is selected and used to predict a ranking which this user may find interesting based on previous search behaviour. The recommender outputs are used in combination with the output of a standard IR system to produce the overall output to the user. In this thesis, the IR and recommender components of this integrated model are investigated. ...|$|E
