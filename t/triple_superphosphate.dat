40|$|Foi estudado, em vasos de Mitscherlich, o comportamento de fertilizantes fosfatados, em duas dosagens de P 2 O 5 total e três condições de pH do solo, em relação ao trigo e à soja, esta plantada para testar o efeito {{residual}} dos adubos. Dos cinco fosfatos estudados, os superfosfatos simples e triplo superaram os fosfatos naturais, na produção do trigo. Para a soja, as diferenças entre êles desapareceram. Nas duas culturas o fosfato Alvorada superou a média de produção da fosforita de Olinda e apatita de Araxá. Os fertilizantes fosfatados reagiram diferentemente cm presença de calagem. O superfosfato simples e o superfosfato triplo reagiram melhor em pH igual a 5, 4 e 5, 3, respectivamente. As melhores faixas de pH para os fosfatos naturais, foram 5, 1 a 5, 3, 4, 7 a 5, 0 e 4, 8 a 5, 3, respectivamente, para fosforita de Olinda, apatita de Araxá e fosfato Alvorada. As produções do trigo caíram da dose I para a dose 2 de calcário, tendo a curva de produção o seu ponto máximo entre essas duas doses. O efeito do calcário, para a soja, foi linear e altamente significativo, sendo de 62 % o aumento verificado da dose 0 para a dose 2. Correlação entre reação do fósforo e pH do solo foi estabelecida, a fim de explicar o comportamento dos fertilizantes fosfatados.

Of the five phosphates studied, simple and <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphates</b> were superior to the natural phosphates, as far as wheat is concerned. As for soybeans, the differences between them disappeared. In the two crops, fosfato Alvorada exceeded the average of production of fosforita Olinda and apatita Araxá. The phosphorous fertilizers reacted differently in the presence of lime. The simple and the <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphates</b> reacted better in pH equal to 5. 4 and 5. 3 respectively. The best strains of pH for the natural phosphates were 5. 1 up to 5. 3, 4. 7 up to 5. 0 and 4. 8 up to 5. 3 respectively, for Olinda fosforita, Araxá apatita and Alvorada fosfato. The productions of wheat fell from dose 1 of lime to dose 2, and the production curve had its upmost point between these two levels The effect of lime, for soybeans, was linear and highly significant, an increase of 62 %being noticed from dose 0 to dose 2.

40|$|There {{is concern}} {{that the use of}} lower quality {{phosphate}} rock can result in elevated amounts of Fe-Al-P water-insoluble compounds in fertilizers and, consequently, low agronomic effectiveness. Therefore, studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of some of these compounds on plant growth. Four commercial superphosphates varying in chemical composition (two single and two <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphates)</b> were selected for the study. Fertilizer impurities were collected as water-insoluble residues by washing each P source with deionized water. A modal analysis, based primarily on elemental chemical analysis and x-ray diffractometry, was used to estimate the chemical composition of each P source. Water-soluble monocalcium phosphate (MCP) and the water-leached fertilizer residues were prepared to give a range of fertilizers in terms of water-soluble phosphorus (WSP) (0 - 100 % of the available P as MCP). The water-leached fractions, MCP, and the mixtures of MCP with water-leached fractions were applied to supply 40 mg available P kg(1) to a thermic Rhodic Kanhapludult with pH values of 5. 2 +/- 0. 05 (unlimed) and 6. 4 +/- 0. 08 (limed). Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in a greenhouse for 101 d served as the test crop. The requirement for WSP was source and pH dependent. At a soil pH of 5. 2, the fertilizers required 73 to 95 % WSP to reach the maximum dry-matter yield, while they required 60 to 86 % WSP at pH 6. 4. To reach 90 % of the maximum yield, all superphosphate fertilizers required < 50 % WSP. These results show that it is not always necessary to have high water solubility as required by legislation in many countries...|$|R

50|$|Tithonia diversifolia can be {{distributed}} as for biomass green fertilizer. Since this fertilizer requires high labour, {{it is recommended}} for use with high value crops such as tomato, kale, carrot, and maize. First, the plant is grown in hedges {{around the edges of}} harvest land. It is important though to keep the maximum amount of growing area a farmer has. The green stems (not the woody stems), leaves, and flowers can be removed from the plant at a farmer selected time, though it is recommended that cutting every 5 months will give a plentiful amount of nutrients in the biomass. Biomass refers to when a plants’ foliage is planted into the soil as a dry fertilizer. The biomass can also be used as a mulch and can be left on top of the soil to decompose into the ground. It has been found that the biomass from T. diversifolia breaks down rapidly and releases nutrients quickly. When applying the mulch or biomass to the soil, it should be applied at the minimum amount of one ton to every hectare of land. However, the best yield is given when 5 tons/hectare is applied. The downside here {{is that a lot of}} foliage is needed to cover a small area of land because it has a high water content. Mixing this biomass with a synthetic fertilizer will bring higher yields. A study found that when applying tithonia with <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate</b> (TSP) that the yields increased by 220% compared to a control test containing only an inorganic nitrogen fertilizer (Urea). When using T. diversifolia it should be supplemented with a Mg fertilizer as this nutrient is lacking in quantity when compared to other green fertilizers.|$|E

30|$|Based on this study, {{the average}} Cd in {{improved}} rice varieties were 85  µg/kg (median 55  µg/kg) whereas improved rice grains from wet zone had 128  µg/kg of Cd that is significantly higher compared to rice from the intermediate zone (54  µg/kg) and the dry zone (68  µg/kg) (Fig.  2 b). Mobilization of Cd in soil solution {{is sensitive to}} redox conditions in which mobilization is more favored under reducing conditions (Chuan et al. 1996). The heavy rainfall associated with the wet zone regions results in prolonged submerging of paddy soils resulting in extreme reducing conditions (Chandrajith et al. 2005 b). This facilitates the mobilization of Cd and the subsequent uptake of this by the rice plant. Dry zone paddy soils are irrigated at rates that prevent prolonged submergence that may facilitate binding of Cd into oxides and/or oxyhydroxides of Fe and Mn (Chuan et al. 1996). Phosphate fertilizers particularly superphosphates are the major host of Cd in rice paddy fields and from 2.3 to 46  mg/kg of Cd were reported in <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphates</b> in Sri Lanka (Chandrajith et al. 2010). Compared to white rice (70  µg/kg), red rice (123  µg/kg) had a significantly higher Cd level (Fig.  3 b) but the wet zone red rice showed a skewed distribution of Cd content from 9.6 to 576  µg/kg. Native rice varieties of Sri Lanka showed a mean Cd content of 33  µg/kg (median =  27  µg/kg) that is {{significantly lower than the}} improved varieties (Fig.  4). Application of organic fertilizer would be the reason for lower Cd content in native rice samples. The mean Cd content of rice in some neighboring countries are 78  µg/kg (India); 50  µg/kg (Nepal) and 27  µg/kg (Thailand), most of which are much lower than the Cd content in Sri Lankan rice (Meharg et al. 2009). However over 92  % of the improved rice samples collected from Sri Lanka contained Cd at a level less than the Codex Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants (CCFAC) maximum permissible level for rice grain of 200  µg/kg (FAO/WHO 2006). As already mentioned, rice is the staple diet of the Sri Lankan population that accounts for over 50  % of the dry diet that provides about 1000 calories. The average Cd intake from improved rice is 24  µg/day while wet zone rice provide 36  µg/day Cd which is significantly higher compared to intake from the dry zone (19  µg/day) and the intermediate zone (15  µg/day). The intake is lower (9.47  µg/day) for a person who consumes native rice (Table  2).|$|R

The results showed that the mixtures of <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate</b> and phosphate of Gafsa result in smaller agronomic efficiency, when compared to the <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate.</b> The phosphate of Gafsa, when applied broadcast, is equivalent to the <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate,</b> however, when applied in the band, it is inefficient for the soybean crop...|$|E
40|$|Remediation of metal-contaminated soils by {{phosphate}} fixation {{is successful}} in temperate environments, whereas its efficacy in cold and freezing environments is understudied. Phosphate fixation is a low-cost technique and is potentially very useful in these remote environments where {{the logistics of}} remediation are difficult and expensive. Here we describe a field study at Casey Station, East Antarctica, where phosphate (<b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate</b> and phosphate rock) and a buffer, Emag (magnesium carbonate and magnesium oxide), were introduced to contaminated soil from nearby Thala Valley landfill. A pilot scale experiment was set up, sampled and monitored from December 2008 to February 2010. Relative to levels in the untreated landfill material, concentrations of Cd, Cu, Co, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn in leachates were decreased by phosphate addition (fixation most effective for Mn and Zn), whereas the technique increased concentrations of As, Cr and Ni. The most successful fixation was found for the 3 : 2 ratio of <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate</b> and Emag, and the least effective fixation occurred with the 2 : 1 : 1 ratio of <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate,</b> Emag and phosphate rock. Although there was an undesirable initial flush of metals from the contaminated soil in the 24 - 48. h after treatment addition, concentrations in leachate were reduced and stabilised in the second summer. During a full-scale field implementation, complementary techniques {{would be required to}} contain and treat contaminated runoff until leachates have reduced to acceptable concentrations. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria on phosphorus fertilizer use efficiency, mycorrhizal dependence and grain yield and dry matter yield of maize under water deficit conditions, a field experiment was conducted as split-split plot arrangement based on randomized complete block design with three replications. The treatments in this experiment were included as follows: irrigation (normal irrigation and water deficit stress based on evaporation from class A pan evaporation); combined different seed inoculations with AM and Pseudomonas fluorescens and treatment of chemical phosphate fertilizer (non- consumption of phosphate fertilizer, consumption of 50 percent of <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate</b> fertilizer needed, and consumption of rock phosphate, based on the quantity of consumed phosphorus of <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate</b> source). The results showed that effects of irrigation, seed inoculation with AM and Pseudomonas fluorescens biological phosphate fertilizer and chemical phosphate fertilizer were significant on yield and yield components, dry matter yield, relative agronomic efficiency and root colonization. Mild stress significantly reduced grain yield, relative agronomic efficiency and fertilizer agronomic efficiency compared to optimum irrigation. Results showed that grain and dry matter yield are highly correlated with root colonization under mild stress condition. Maximum mycorrhizal dependence was obtained in mild stress condition. Maximum relative agronomic efficiency, fertilizer agronomic efficiency, yield and yield components was related to seed inoculation with AM and Pseudomonas fluorescens. The use of <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate</b> fertilizer were increased grain yield in comparison with rock phosphate along with inoculation of phosphate solubilizing microorganisms. However, maximum root colonization and mycorrhizal dependence was achieved in non- consumption treatment of phosphate fertilizer...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{appraise}} various types of phosphate fertilizers (bone meal, superphosphate, <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate,</b> and potassium orthophosphate) for immobilizing metals and metalloids in mining-impacted soils from Broken Hill, Australia. Soils were rich in metals (Pb, Zn, Cu, and Cd) and metalloids (As and Sb) which were mainly contained in minor to trace amounts of coronadite [PbMn 8 O 16], kintoreite [PbFe 3 (PO 4) 2 (OH,H 2 O) 6], Pb, and Zn sulfides and sulfates (possibly sphalerite, galena, and anglesite) as well as in unidentified soluble metal-bearing phases. Phosphate stabilization experiments were conducted as kinetic column leaching experiments, and chemical and mineralogical changes were assessed using elemental, sulfur isotope, and XRD analyses as well as electron microprobe phase mapping. The application of phosphate fertilizer to the metal-contaminated topsoils led to mineralogical changes, including the formation of secondary metal-bearing phosphates. The elemental concentrations of leachates were used as a criterion to assess the performance of phosphate treatments. Potassium orthophosphate fertilizer was the most effective amendment for Cd stabilization; superphosphate and <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate</b> fertilizers were the most effective amendments for Pb stabilization. By contrast, the release of As, Cu, Mn, Sb, and Zn were not significantly suppressed, and in several cases, increased, using bone meal, superphosphate, <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate,</b> and potassium orthophosphate amendments. This study indicates that in situ phosphate stabilization of mining-impacted soils at Broken Hill would most likely be a complex and impractical undertaking in residential areas due to the risk of substantial metal, metalloid, phosphate, and sulfate release...|$|E

30|$|The most {{commonly}} used phosphate fertilizers such as <b>Triple</b> <b>superphosphate</b> (20  %), superphosphate (8  %) and diammonium phosphate (20  %) contain {{a high concentration of}} P. Similarly, muriate of potash (50  %) and potassium sulfate (42  %) contained a high concentration of K. The percentage of P and K were 0.63 and 0.40  % in textile sludge which was much lower than the percentages in the respective chemical fertilizers. The amount of S in the textile sludge sample was found to be 0.001  %, lower than the amount of S in chemical fertilizers such as <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate</b> and diammonium phosphate. Moreover, compared to some commonly used N-containing chemical fertilizers such as urea (46  %), ammonium sulfate (21  %) and diammonium phosphate (18 – 21  %), which contained extremely higher concentrations of N, textile sludge was found to be low in TN content (0.47  %). Therefore, it can be concluded that according to the comparison of macronutrient content, textile sludge is more similar to organic manure due to the above-mentioned properties.|$|E

Theexperimental design was a 3 x 5 factorial with DBC, soils and P sources and control, respectively, in four blocks. The treatments consisted of applying mineral sources of P + control (no P application) : <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate,</b> rockphosphate Gafsa, Araxá rock phosphate and silicate termofosfato. The cultures were grown in pots of 3 dm 3 of soil,maintaining four plants per pot for 35 days after emergence. At the end the plants were collected, separated into rootsand shoots and the contents of P were analyzed. Concentrations of available-P, extracted by Mehlich- 1 and RTA, weredetermined for each pot. The available-P by Mehlich- 1 showed a low ratio for extractable P in soils where sources oflow solubility were applied, while the determined by RTA showed greater similarity with the P content present in planttissues. For the cultivation in the clayey Oxisol the application of termofosfato presented greater agronomic efficiencyin relation to <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Oxidic {{soils are}} {{phosphorus}} drains in soil; hence, P availability is a limiting factor in tropical, weathered Oxidic soils. It {{has been shown}} that some brachiarias grown as cover crops may increase soil available P to subsequent crops. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate soil P cycling and availability, as well as the response of soybean to soluble and natural reactive phosphates as affected by ruzi grass (Urochloa ruziziensis, R. Germ. and C. M. Evrard, Crin) grown as a cover crop in a no-till system. Experimental treatments consisted of the presence or absence of ruzi grass in combination with a control (0. 0 P) and soluble and reactive rock phosphate broadcast on the soil surface in the winter (80 kg ha- 1 P 2 O 5), plus three rates of P applied to soybean furrows (0, 30, and 60 kg ha- 1 of P 2 O 5) at planting, in the form of <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate.</b> Soybean was cropped in two seasons: 2010 / 2011 and 2011 / 2012. Soil samples were taken before soybean planting (after desiccation of Brachiaria) at 0. 00 - 0. 05 and 0. 05 - 0. 10 m for soil available P. Total weight of dry matter and P accumulated in ruzi grass were determined, as well as soybean yields, P in soybean grains, and P use efficiency (PUE). The use of natural phosphate increased soil P availability. The highest yields were obtained with higher application rates of <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate</b> in the planting furrow combined with broadcast rock phosphate. Broadcast application of Arad reactive phosphate increases and maintains soil available P, and this practice, associated with ruzi grass grown as a cover crop and the use of <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate</b> applied to soybean furrows, results in higher use of P by soybeans...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of balanced application of chemical phosphorus fertilizer and seed inoculation with phosphate solubilizing bacterium and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus and on the yield and yield components of maize (Zea mays L.) under normal and limited irrigation conditions, a split-split plots arrangement based on randomized complete block design with three replications was conducted. Treatments consisted of two levels of irrigation including: irrigation of 60 (normal irrigation) and 120 (limited irrigation) mm evaporation from class A pan evaporation; combination of phosphate solubilizing microorganisms (arbuscular mycorrhiza fungus and phosphate solubilizing bacterium) at four levels; and phosphate chemical fertilizer at three levels includes: no consumption of phosphate chemical fertilizer (control), consumption of 50 % <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate</b> fertilizer needed based on soil-test results and consumption of rock phosphate (based on the quantity of consumed phosphate of <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate</b> source). The {{results showed that the}} irrigation levels had significant affect on all traits except harvest index, and the phosphate solubilizing microorganisms had significantly affected all traits except harvest index and number of row in ear. The results of mean comparison indicated that the maximum of amount most traits related to normal irrigation treatment, and co-application of phosphate solubilizing bacterium-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus. The effect of phosphate chemical fertilizer on all traits was significant. Results of interactions between irrigation and phosphate solubilizing microorganisms in both normal irrigation and limited irrigation conditions showed that the co-application of phosphate solubilizing bacterium-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus increased grain yield more than other treatments; Also, the result of balanced application of phosphate chemical fertilizer with phosphate solubilizing microorganisms showed that effect of balanced application of <b>triple</b> <b>superphosphate</b> fertilizer along with phosphate solubilizing microorganisms on investigated traits was more than rock phosphate...|$|E
