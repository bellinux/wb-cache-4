5|$|The {{evidence}} for auxiliary ranks and pay is scant: even less exists than the patchy {{evidence for}} their legionary counterparts. <b>There</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> consensus, however, that the auxiliary was paid {{one third of}} what a legionary received: 300 sesterces a year (400 after {{the reign of the}} emperor Commodus). Both auxiliaries and seamen received the viaticum of 300 sesterces, although the various sources differ as to whether auxiliaries and sailors received the retirement bonus known as the honesta missio, or honorable discharge.|$|E

However, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> uncertainty whether or not the New Hampshire section of the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail will be included in the final NST designation.|$|E
25|$|Investigation {{of ancient}} stone huts {{found on the}} island {{indicate}} {{that it has been}} inhabited since the 3rdmillennium BCE. Thucydides identifies the original inhabitants as piratical Carians who were eventually expelled by King Minos of Crete. By the time of the Odyssey the island was already famous as the birthplace of the twin gods Apollo and Artemis (although <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> confusion of Artemis' birthplace being either Delos or the island of Ortygia). Indeed, between 900BCE and 100CE, sacred Delos was a major cult centre, where Dionysus is also in evidence as well as the Titaness Leto, mother of the above-mentioned twin deities. Eventually acquiring Panhellenic religious significance, Delos was initially a religious pilgrimage for the Ionians.|$|E

500|$|I'm writing {{short stories}} right now, that's what I do between novels, and I love them. I'm very devoted to it. You know, it's funny. <b>There</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> sort {{of law that}} you only get to be celebrated for one or the other. And then {{a couple of people}} will break it. Updike did. They didn't review his story {{collections}} by saying, [...] "Well, these are nice, but he's a novelist." [...] Or review his novels by saying, [...] "Well, too bad he can't do the longer stuff." [...] Other people tend to get patronized on one end or the other—and I'll take it. I have a very happy life as a novelist. But the story collections I've published are tremendously important to me. And many of the uncollected stories—or yet-to-be-collected stories—are among my proudest writings. They're very closely allied, obviously, to novel writing. But also very distinct, and, you know, there's no need to choose.|$|E
500|$|The cricket press {{noticed the}} absence of Crawford and the {{professionals}} from Surrey's team over the following games, and noted that Crawford was now playing club cricket. Meanwhile, Alverstone wrote to Crawford that the Surrey committee fully supported Leveson Gower's decision to omit Rushby and Lees, {{and told him that}} Surrey would not select him again unless he apologised to Leveson Gower. Crawford refused, writing to Alverstone: [...] "I do not know who was responsible for the selection of the second eleven sort of team furnished up for such an important match... <b>There</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> impression amongst a few of the Surrey committee that I am some young professional instead of being a young fellow who has had an experience of cricket that has seldom fallen to the lot of anyone, and my request for an alteration of the team should have had some weight". In his History of Cricket, Benny Green describes the letter as evidence of a [...] "literate and quietly self-confident young man who will not easily be manipulated." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>There</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> {{confusion}} in several historical sources regarding the marriage. For example, the twelfth-century monk Ordericus Vitalis (died 1142×) claimed that Magnús himself married {{the daughter of}} an Irish king in about 1093. According to Morkinskinna, Magnús was at one point set to marry a certain Maktildr, described as an [...] "emperor's daughter". It is possible that Maktildr represents Matilda (died 1118), a woman who was a sister of the reigning Étgar mac Maíl Choluim, King of Scotland (died 1107), and who is known to have married Henry I, King of England (died 1135) in 1110. In fact, the episode concerning Magnús and Maktildr in Morkinskinna may have influenced the erroneous claim preserved by the same source and Fagrskinna purporting that Sigurðr married a daughter of Máel Coluim mac Donnchada, King of Scotland. At {{about the same time as}} the marriage between Bjaðmunjo and Sigurðr, the former's father secured yet another marital alliance through another daughter and Arnulf de Montgomery, Earl of Pembroke (died 1118×1122), an English magnate in the midst of a revolt against the reigning King of England.|$|E

But, he suggests, [...] "even in this pathologically difficult case of translation, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> rough equivalence obtainable, a kind of rough isomorphism, partly global, partly local, between the brains of all the readers".|$|E

The middle portion is on the lesser kings and the Velir chieftains, who were feudatories of these three major kingdoms, with a short intervening section (poems 182 - 195) of didactic poems. [...] The final portion deals with the general scenery of war and the effect of warfare.|$|E
