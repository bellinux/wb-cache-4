5000|$|The teacher Henry Robyn {{supplied}} the school {{with his own}} custom-made braille printing press. The press functioned by means of metal slugs bearing braille dots in relief: the slugs were hand-placed in a flat frame, over which soft rollers were run <b>to</b> <b>emboss</b> the dots onto paper. The press first {{went to work in}} 1865 with Robyn personally handling its operation.|$|E

5000|$|Die cut, Emboss and Scores: These effects {{work well}} with most Letterpress paper. Images <b>to</b> <b>emboss</b> or die cut are called out in a {{different}} color layer (typically magenta). Scores are typically indicated with a cyan line. Any intricate shapes or patterns should be reviewed with the printer. For thick cover stocks many printers use a [...] "kiss cut" [...] (partially through the stock) rather than a score.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} letter stamps or number stamps. These are used <b>to</b> <b>emboss</b> the {{impression}} of a letter or number into a workpiece. They are most common in the reverse image, this allows the end result to be immediately readable, however they may be made as a positive image. This is essential in the case of die or mold making and ensures that the finished product will be readable, as a die is a negative image.|$|E
5000|$|An {{embossing}} station: The IRD engineers {{purchased and}} modified a Data Card Corp embossing machine and interfaced {{it with the}} IBM 360 computer <b>to</b> <b>emboss</b> the cards. [...] The original design concept called for an Addressograph-Multigraph embossing machine, however, the IRD engineers quickly switched to a Data Card Corp embossing machine. Data Card Corp, a Minneapolis/St. Paul company had just developed the first electronically controlled embossing machine for plastic cards and effectively obsoleted all other mechanical operated embossers.|$|E
50|$|A notable {{feature of}} gift books was their {{decorative}} aspect. They featured increasingly lavish bindings, ranging from glazed paper <b>to</b> <b>embossed</b> silk or embossed and inlaid leather with mother of pearl. Their size increased {{over time as}} well as their interior decoration. Pages often featured flowery borders, and the books were copiously illustrated with engravings or colored plates. An inscription plate was often included for the gift giver to inscribe to the recipient.|$|R

5000|$|Intended for use <b>to</b> <b>emboss</b> {{official}} documents, {{the seal}} {{is not intended}} for decorative use, the single exception being a large version carved in hardwood and affixed to the Vermont Pavilion at the Expo 67 World's Fair. That seal was later used as a backdrop behind the podium in the Vermont State House Press Briefing Room, which is now the minority party's caucus room. The large wooden Great Seal of Vermont has been moved to the working offices of the governor of Vermont at The Pavilion.|$|E
50|$|In America, one cent coins {{are most}} {{commonly}} used in these vending machines, as they are thin, easy <b>to</b> <b>emboss,</b> and are the smallest denomination of American money (most machines charge $.50 {{in addition to the}} cent rolled). All American cents produced after 1982 have a zinc core, and using them produces elongated coins with zinc streaks. This zinc streaking can be avoided by using coins produced before 1982. (The United States Mint produced both compositions during 1982.) Less common are machines that press designs into quarters, dimes, and nickels.|$|E
5000|$|Dashew's {{work with}} Bank of America {{led to the}} {{creation}} of the BankAmericard, the first plastic bank credit card system. Diners Club and other bank and credit card programs quickly followed. His further work with Joe Williams, retired from Bank of America, led to the introduction of Uni-card (taken over from Chase Manhattan Bank), which was later renamed VISA. To pitch his company’s unique position to American Express <b>to</b> <b>emboss</b> more variable data faster than his competitors, he printed the name of each board executive on each man’s sample card, along with a date and the catchphrase he created, “Member Since…” ...|$|E
50|$|Pointillé is a {{decorative}} technique in which patterns are formed on a surface by {{a means of}} punched dots. The technique is similar <b>to</b> <b>embossing</b> or engraving but is done manually and does not cut into the surface being decorated. Pointillé was commonly used to decorate arms and armor starting {{in the fifteenth century}} http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/dect/hd_dect.htm. The Holy Thorn Reliquary in the British Museum, made in France {{at the end of the}} 14th century, has very fine and delicate pointillé work in gold.|$|R
50|$|The state {{first issued}} annual license plates on October 1, 1911, with plate #1 being issued to the Leak Funeral Home in Montgomery. Until 1980, the license year was October 1 to September 30. Porcelain plates were {{originally}} used, {{before the state}} switched <b>to</b> <b>embossed</b> metal plates in 1915. The 1916-17 plate {{was the first to}} feature the year of expiration, while the 1921-22 plate was the first to use a horsepower class system, with each class denoted by a letter. Kilby Prison near Montgomery took charge of all plate manufacture in 1928.|$|R
5000|$|... "Debossing" [...] {{is similar}} <b>to</b> <b>embossing,</b> but {{recesses}} the design rather than raising it. Rather than the paper being raised in specific areas, it is indented. The process involves applying {{pressure to the}} front side of a substrate and forcing the material down from the surface. Although {{it is not as}} common as embossing, it is occasionally used to provide a different effect or appearance that fits a particular theme. Embossing and debossing on digitally printed applications is an off-line process, which may add a significant cost to the job.|$|R
5000|$|As screw heads {{damage the}} wood and could put extra stress on it, {{typically}} a rectangular metal plate or a pair of metal plates are used to secure the joint and re-distribute the screw pressure evenly. Such a plate is usually criticized for making playing on top frets uncomfortable, so, manufacturers sometimes employ some kind of more intricate method to hide a metal plate, smooth the angles and make access to top frets easier. However, a visible metal plate is usually considered {{as a part of}} [...] "vintage" [...] style and they are a popular place <b>to</b> <b>emboss</b> manufacturer's logos, stamp out serial numbers and put other artwork.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Artificial {{polycarbonate}} moth eye structured {{plate was}} used <b>to</b> <b>emboss</b> the moth eye nano-pattern into PVC films. Embossing {{was done at}} 100 °C to prevent any damage on polycarbonate template. With embossing of moth eye nano-patterns, transmittance of PVC film was increased up to 6 % over 400 nm to 800 nm wavelength region. This embossed PVC film was then used as an imprint template after depositing thin layer of SiO 2 and self-assembled monolayer. Consequently, polymer based moth eye nano-patterns were formed on glass template after UV imprinting and its transmittance was increased from 90 % to 92 %...|$|E

40|$|Plasma polymer {{surfaces}} {{have been}} produced and analysed to evaluate their suitability as biomimetic and bioactive surfaces. The conclusions drawn are listed below:• Plasma patterning of surfaces {{can be achieved by}} both an "ink and lift-off' or "emboss and lift-off" approaches. Plasma patterning using the "emboss and lift-off' approach improves with increasing force used <b>to</b> <b>emboss</b> the aperture containing device. Plasma polymer patterned surfaces can be used to mimic naturally occurring micro-condensers and a combination of super-hydrophobic and super-hydrophilic surfaces results in the optimal micro-condenser. Super-hydrophilic plasma polymer surfaces are superior in cell adhesion tests to polymers at higher contact angles.

40|$|Porous {{biodegradable}} polymeric scaffolds {{are essential}} for tissue engineering application since they should provide the adequate three-dimensional structure for cellular attachment and tissue development. In particular, pore size and shape and overall porosity are key structural features in controlling neotissue formation. Since scaffolds structural properties play a relevant role in all processes involved in tissue genesis including cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, growth, differentiation and biosynthesis, an accurate control over the pore size and its distribution, pore shape, pore interconnectivity, and overall porosity of scaffolds is mandatory {{for the success of}} any tissue engineering approach. Several methods have been proposed to tailor make porous scaffolds to obtain the desired pore structure. Here, three techniques <b>to</b> <b>emboss</b> a controlled pattern of porosity in biodegradable polymers, particulate leaching, phase separation and gas foaming along with their combinations, are critically reviewed highlighting process-structure-property relationship...|$|E
