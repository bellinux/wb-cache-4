40|$|Abstract: Microfluidic systems require {{numerous}} {{control valves}} {{in order to}} function properly. These valves form the basic unit of fluid handling within the microfluidic system. Many different valves have been designed and manufactured, both active and passive. The current paper investigates a novel passive valve that works {{on the principle of}} hydrostatic pressure. This normally closed valve can also be used in a <b>toggle</b> <b>valve</b> combination, where only one external actuation source is required to yield two valves that open and close sequentially. The first valve is an active valve, operated pneumatically. The second valve operates purely on the pressure applied by the fluid in the microfluidic channel at the valve entrance. One valve is thus always closed, while the other is open. By changing the valve entrance properties, the valve can be designed to operate at different actuation pressures. The valve mechanism, which consists of four layers of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), was designed and manufactured using the SU- 8 lithography and replication molding processes. It was successfully implemented, and initial results show the relationship between the applied pressure and flow rate. In addition to being used as a <b>toggle</b> <b>valve,</b> this design also allows for the passive valve {{to be used as a}} stand-alone pressure valve and as a one way valve, which would restrict fluid flow to a single direction. This may give rise to the possibility of designing entirely passive microfluidic devices, which would be advantageous from a circuit complexity and energy usage perspective.

40|$|Microfluidics {{provides}} {{a powerful and}} versatile technology to accurately control spatial and temporal conditions for cell culturing and can therefore be used to study cellular responses to gradients. Here we use Lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) to solve both the Navier-Stokes equation (NSE) for the fluid and the coupled convection-diffusion equation (CDE) for the compounds that form the diffusion-based gradient. The design of a microfluidic chamber for diffusion-based gradients must avoid flow through the cell chamber. This {{can be achieved by}} alternately opening the source and the sink channels. The fast <b>toggling</b> of microfluidic <b>valves</b> requires switching between different boundary conditions. We demonstrate that the LBM is a powerful method for handling complex geometries, high Peclet number conditions, discontinuities in the boundary conditions, and multiphysics coupling.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 As the {{semiconductor}} industry works to integrate increasingly more "non-CMOS" devices onto CMOS ICs, compact model development has become {{an important step in}} the circuit/system verification tool flow. This research focuses on the two- and three-dimensional modeling of the physical phenomena that occur in nanoscale magnetic devices. This includes the continuous time dynamics of the changing magnetization state in magnetic thin film spintronic devices such as GMR spin <b>valves,</b> <b>toggle</b> MRAM bits and magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). The various torques responsible for magnetization change are modeled in Verilog-A modules and have been simulated for several static and dynamic cases. Device behavior is verified using current-in-plane Oersted fields and current-perpendicular-to-plane, spin transfer torque (STT) as stimulus. All device compact models have electrical I/O and are being developed to provide accurate device terminal behavior when used in a circuit simulation environment with standard CMOS circuits...|$|R
