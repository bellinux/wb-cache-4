5|$|I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> {{you name}} a record, {{you have to}} choose {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. You also want to choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record, but the mood of the people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E
5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> {{my father}} remarried. Because {{for the three}} years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} said {{anything}} about politics today. I don't propose {{to say anything about}} politics. You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E

25|$|As President Bush's AIDS Coordinator, Tobias was {{responsible}} for setting policy detailing which countries would receive monies from various US agencies, how much, and what the rules governing assignment of those funds would be. As AIDS Coordinator, he discussed the rules {{in an interview with}} PBS' Frontline where he detailed a legal requirement that recipients of U.S. aid denounce prostitution:The Congress I think very appropriately has put into the legislation that created this program that organizations, in order to receive money, need to have a policy opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking. I don't think it's too difficult for people to be opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking, which are in fact two contributing causes to the spread of HIV/AIDS. I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> organizations initially became aware of that requirement, some organizations were concerned about what the implications of that might be, but we implemented that in the first year with non-U.S. organizations. We're now implementing that requirement with U.S. organizations. And so far, I really know of no problems that we've had on the ground.|$|E

When asked about Casares, defensive end Ed O'Bradovich stated, [...] "Oh my God, I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> you talk to my fellow teammates over here, what was all right, true and good about professional football was embodied in Rick Casares.

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1915, Noether was invited {{to return to the}} University of Göttingen by David Hilbert and Felix Klein. Their effort to recruit her, however, was blocked by the philologists and historians among the {{philosophical}} faculty: women, they insisted, should not become privatdozent. One faculty member protested: [...] "What will our soldiers <b>think</b> <b>when</b> they return to the university and find that they are required to learn at the feet of a woman?" [...] Hilbert responded with indignation, stating, [...] "I do not see that the sex of the candidate is an argument against her admission as privatdozent.

500|$|Bryan's announcement, after {{gaining the}} Democratic nomination, {{that he would}} {{undertake}} a nationwide tour by rail, something then unusual for presidential candidates, put pressure on McKinley to match him. Hanna especially urged his candidate to hit the road. McKinley decided against this, feeling {{that he could not}} outdo Bryan, who was a brilliant stump speaker, and that he would be foolish to try. [...] "I might as well put up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete against some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. I have to <b>think</b> <b>when</b> I speak." [...] Furthermore, no matter how McKinley traveled, Bryan would upstage him by choosing a less comfortable manner. McKinley was unwilling to compete with Bryan on the Democrat's terms, and sought to find his own way to reach the people.|$|E

Critical reaction to the prologue was positive, with one critic commenting that [...] "no one gets {{to make a film}} on this kind of scale anymore. Except for Christopher Nolan," [...] though a round-up of reviews highlighted the way many critics found Tom Hardy's dialogue very difficult to hear. Addressing the issue in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Nolan said [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> people see the film, things will come into focus.

500|$|Angus Young later recalled, [...] "I {{remember}} the first time I had ever heard Brian's (Johnson) name was from Bon. Bon had mentioned that he had been in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said 'Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard.' And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we said we should see if we can find him." ...|$|E

I have to <b>think</b> <b>when</b> I speak." [...] Instead of going to the people, McKinley would remain at home in Canton and allow the people to come to him; according to historian R. Hal Williams in his book on the 1896 election, [...] "it was, as it turned out, a brilliant strategy. McKinley's 'Front Porch Campaign' became a legend in American political history." ...|$|E
500|$|The Cure's primary musical traits {{have been}} listed as [...] "dominant, melodic bass lines; whiny, strangulated vocals; and a lyric {{obsession}} with existential, almost literary despair." [...] Most Cure songs start with Smith and Gallup writing the drum parts and bass lines. Both record demos {{at home and}} then bring them into the studio for fine-tuning. Smith said in 1992, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> {{people talk about the}} 'Cure sound', they mean songs based on six-string bass, acoustic guitar and my voice, plus the string sound from the Solina." [...] On top of this foundation is laid [...] "towering layers of guitars and synthesisers". Keyboards have been a component of the band's sound since Seventeen Seconds, and their importance increased with the instrument's extensive use on Disintegration. During Roger O'Donnell's absence between 2005 and 2011, keyboards were not used at all during their live shows, and were not as prominent on their 2008 album 4:13 Dream.|$|E
