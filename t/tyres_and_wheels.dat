5000|$|The idea of {{manufacturing}} the 6 pounder in the US was {{expressed by the}} US Army Ordnance in February 1941. At that time, the US Army still favoured the 37mm Gun M3 and production was planned solely for lend lease. The US version, classified as substitute standard under the designation 57 mm Gun M1, {{was based on the}} 6 pounder Mark II, two units of which were received from the UK. However, since there was sufficient lathe capacity, the longer barrel could be produced from the start. Production started early in 1942 and continued until 1945. The M1A1 variant used US [...] "Combat" [...] <b>tyres</b> <b>and</b> <b>wheels.</b> The M1A2 introduced the British practice of free traverse, meaning that the gun could be traversed by the crew pushing and pulling on the breech, instead of solely geared traverse, from September 1942. The M1 was made standard issue in the Spring of 1943.|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} the landing gear {{is one of the}} prime aspects of {{aircraft}} design. Literature describes the design process thoroughly, however the integration of these design methods within an automated design framework has had little focus in literature. Landing gear design includes different engineering disciplines including structures, weights, kinematics, economics and runway design. Interaction between these different disciplines makes the landing gear a complex system. Automating the design process has shown to have the advantage of increased productivity, better support for design decisions and can provide the capability of collaborative and distributed design. The automation tools improve performance of current designs and simplify the development of new aircraft configurations. In this thesis a systematic and automated landing gear design procedure is proposed. Positioning the landing gear on the aircraft is limited by several requirements. Requirements include take-off stability, touchdown stability, wing-tip and engine clearance, ground handling and stability while taxiing. Evaluation of all these limits results in a feasible design space from which the shortest possible landing gear is found. From the resulting landing gear position, loads on the landing gear struts are calculated. <b>Tyres</b> <b>and</b> <b>wheels</b> are selected and brakes and shock absorbers are designed. The assembly of landing gear components can then be used to make an analytical weight estimation. This analytical weight estimation is based on maximum stresses occurring within the structure due to extreme load cases prescribed in certification specifications. Preventing yielding and buckling within the structure then results in required component thicknesses. A multi-body model is then made, where structural parts are seen as rigid bodies. The multi-body model evaluates and visualises the system dynamics. The oleo-pneumatic shock absorber forces and motion are modelled using an analytical relation. An empirical tyre model models tyre motion and forces at the contact point. These two models can accurately describe forces within the tyres and shocks due to externally applied forces, which then allows for the evaluation of extreme landing load cases. This is done to verify empirically estimated dynamic landing loads used in the weight estimation. And this is done to identify loading peaks that could occur during a landing. In addition to the landing simulation a simulation of the landing gear retraction mechanism is done to check the kinematic feasibility and compliance to certification requirements. Verification of results of the implemented landing gear with reference aircraft shows that landing gear positions closely match with actual landing gear positions. The analytical weight estimation of the landing gear assembly estimates the total gear weight with an error of 15 percent. This is comparable to the result of an empirical weight estimation that has an error of 17 percent. Multi-body simulation results show that dynamic loads during an extreme landing are similar to empirically estimated dynamic loads. For landing gears with multiple rows of tyres it is especially important to look at landing loads, since a hard landing then creates peaks at high frequency in the shock loads. These peaks originate from the interaction between front and rear axle tyres hitting the ground at different times. A kinematic simulation of retraction and extension then verifies the kinematic feasibility. This simulation also shows that the retraction and locking mechanisms work and that it can be stowed within the available space. The resulting landing gear design and analysis tools complete the existing aircraft design tools, which then forms the basis for the future improvement of automated transport aircraft design.

40|$|An {{aircraft}} pavement strength {{rating system}} has been internationally adopted since 1981. Since that time, aircraft <b>tyre</b> pressures <b>and</b> <b>wheel</b> loads have increased significantly {{and an increase in}} shear-related surface distress has been reported. The current strength rating system focuses on protection of the subgrade. It also includes a tyre pressure limit intended to protect stress-susceptible surfaces. However, the shear stresses in the surface layer {{have been shown to be}} a function of both the <b>tyre</b> pressure <b>and</b> the individual <b>wheel</b> load. A modification to the current aircraft pavement strength rating system is recommended. The proposed modification replaces the current tyre pressure rating with a classification number that reflects the contribution of both <b>tyre</b> pressure <b>and</b> <b>wheel</b> load to surface layer shear stress. Guidance is also provided on the selection of a surface rating and the granting of approval for usage by aircraft with more demanding <b>wheel</b> load <b>and</b> <b>tyre</b> pressure combinations.

50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{difference}} {{is in the}} wheels. Traction engines were generally built with large fabricated spoked steel wheels with wide rims. Those intended for road use would have continuous solid rubber tyres bolted around the rims, to improve traction on tarmac.

40|$|A {{pavement}} strength {{rating system}} is internationally adopted {{in order to}} protect aircraft pavements from inadvertent overload. The system has two elements. The primary element is designed to protect the pavement against subgrade rutting and the second is intended to protect asphalt pavement surfaces. The surface-protection element is arbitrary and empirical, placing category-based limits on aircraft tyre pressures. In 2008, increases in the tyre pressure limits were proposed by aircraft manufacturers and these were approved in 2013. The research reported in this paper assesses the impact of <b>tyre</b> pressure <b>and</b> individual <b>wheel</b> load increases on calculated flexible pavement stress indicators, as well as identifying an improved surface layer protection element. Stresses were calculated near the surface, at the surface layer interface and at the subgrade. <b>Tyre</b> pressure <b>and</b> <b>wheel</b> load combinations included current (18 t and 1. 35 MPa), imminent (33 t and 1. 75 MPa) and future (40 t and 2. 15 MPa) aircraft. Surface layer stress increased significantly (20 – 30 %) with increases in both <b>tyre</b> pressure <b>and</b> <b>wheel</b> load. The subgrade stress increased near-equally (97 %) with wheel load but was insensitive (< 1 %) to tyre pressure changes. The ability of the current aircraft pavement strength rating system to protect pavements from the increasing demands of aircraft was demonstrated to be limited to the subgrade. It is recommended that the tyre pressure rating be amended to reflect the combined impact of both <b>tyre</b> pressure rating <b>and</b> individual <b>wheel</b> load. It is also recommended that ongoing efforts to incorporate additional asphalt surface failure modes into routine pavement design be given high priority. The importance of these issues is reinforced by the limited availability of remedies to counter any negative impacts of increased surface layer stresses, especially in hot climates. © 2016 Taylor & Franci...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{investigation}} into the modelling and simulation of an aircraft <b>tyre</b> <b>and</b> <b>wheel</b> assembly in finite element environment. The finite element simulations basing on aircraft <b>tyre</b> test <b>and</b> operational scenarios could predict the loads transferred from <b>tyre</b> <b>and</b> the stresses distributed to the wheel rim. The virtual analysis could assess the safety criteria of different tyre structures, which would lead to the cost and time circle reduction in tyre R&D process. An H 41 x 16. 0 R 20 radial ply aircraft test <b>tyre</b> <b>and</b> its corresponding test wheel, provided by Dunlop Aircraft Tyres Limited, are adopted as the subject of this research. The material properties, especially the rubber and fabric materials, have been investigated. The finite element hyperelastic models have been utilized to represent rubbers and been correlated to experimental data. The 2 D and 3 D finite element tyre models, along with the finite element wheel models are created in the commercial finite element code, LS-Dyna. The finite element models have been validated with either industrial standardised simulation results or experimental data. Basing on the validated models, simulations that duplicating static test and dynamic operational scenarios have been developed.

Octahedral shear and normal stresses were calculated for extreme braking aircraft of various <b>tyre</b> inflation pressures <b>and</b> <b>wheel</b> loads. The historical increase in tyre inflation pressure of around 50 % was shown to have resulted in a moderate 10 % increase in the stress-strength ratio associated with the surface layer interface.

Results are discussed which show significant innovation development when using TRIZ. The efficacy of training key workers in systematic problem solving and creative methods is discussed and the implications for managers in innovation promotion and workplace environment change are highlighted.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} a {{finite element model}} used to investigate the quasi-static behaviour of a stationary automobile tyre vertically loaded against a stiff horizontal surface. The model includes {{a representation of the}} <b>tyre,</b> a steel <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> a surface. The tyre is represented in detail by a number of <b>tyre</b> components, the <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> surface are coarsely modelled. LS-DYNA 3 D is used to simulate the inflation of the tyre, the fit between the <b>tyre</b> <b>and</b> the <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> the vertical loading of the tyre against the surface. Simulation results, such as the load-deflection characteristics and the load-tyre/ground contact patch dimensions are compared with mixed success to those obtained experimentally. The stiffness of the <b>tyre</b> components <b>and</b> the inflation pressure are varied independently and the simulation is repeated. The resulting load-tyre/ground contact patch dimensions are discussed in context with the development of a rolling tyre model.
