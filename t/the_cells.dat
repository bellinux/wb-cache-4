5|$|A {{configuration}} in Rule 90 can be partitioned {{into two}} subsets of cells {{that do not}} interact with each other. One of these two subsets consists of <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> in even positions at even time steps and <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> in odd positions in odd time steps. The other subset consists of <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> in even positions at odd time steps and <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> in odd positions at even time steps. Each of these two subsets {{can be viewed as}} a cellular automaton with only its half of <b>the</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{class of}} problems {{of this type}} concern collections of objects {{that need to be}} updated, such as <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> of a spreadsheet after one of <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> has been changed, or the object files of a piece of computer software after its source code has been changed.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial growth follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the lag phase, a period of slow growth when <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the log phase, {{also known as the}} logarithmic or exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. <b>The</b> <b>cells</b> reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.|$|E

50|$|When a {{plant cell}} {{is placed in}} a {{solution}} that is hypertonic relative to the cytoplasm, water moves out of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> and <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> shrinks. In doing so, <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> becomes flaccid. In extreme cases, <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> becomes plasmolyzed - <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> membrane disengages with <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> wall {{due to lack of}} water pressure on it.|$|R
5000|$|... • Evidence {{indicates}} that those molecules in <b>the</b> <b>cell’s</b> surface {{that act as}} the feet of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> — <b>the</b> integrins, which attach <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> to <b>the</b> substratum — can also be endocytosed and transported through <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> In this way, fresh adhesion sites (see cell adhesion) are provided at <b>the</b> <b>cell’s</b> front.|$|R
5|$|Calcarea have skeletons made of calcite, a form {{of calcium}} carbonate, which may form {{separate}} spicules or large masses. All <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> have a single nucleus and membrane.|$|E
5|$|Cells of {{the genus}} Azotobacter are {{relatively}} large for bacteria (1–2 μm in diameter). They are usually oval, but may take various forms from rods to spheres. In microscopic preparations, <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> can be dispersed or form irregular clusters or occasionally chains of varying lengths. In fresh cultures, cells are mobile due to the numerous flagella. Later, <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> lose their mobility, become almost spherical, and produce {{a thick layer of}} mucus, forming the cell capsule. The shape of the cell is affected by the amino acid glycine which is present in the nutrient medium peptone.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes of {{the smooth}} ER {{are vital to}} the {{synthesis}} of lipids, including oils, phospholipids, and steroids. Sex hormones of vertebrates and the steroid hormones secreted by the adrenal glands are among the steroids produced by the smooth ER in animal cells. <b>The</b> <b>cells</b> that synthesize these hormones are rich in smooth ER.|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} the gas channel {{integrated}} (GCI) cell was reconsidered to reduce <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> thickness without increasing <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> resistance. <b>The</b> <b>cell</b> resistance was decreased by {{the reduction of the}} current collection distance. Furthermore, the changing of the current collection window position also decreased <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> resistance. <b>The</b> new design <b>cell</b> showed <b>the</b> same power density as <b>the</b> former design <b>cell,</b> indicating that <b>the</b> thickness of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> was successfully reduced without any decrease of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> power output. <b>The</b> power output of <b>the</b> new design <b>cell</b> was 1. 6 times larger than that of <b>the</b> planar <b>cell</b> with <b>the</b> same <b>cell</b> size. <b>The</b> large power output per cell was a great advantage of <b>the</b> GCI <b>cell...</b>|$|R
50|$|Cells {{have a more}} acidic pH inside <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> than outside (gastric mucosal cells {{being an}} exception). Therefore, basic drugs (like bupivacaine, pyrimethamine) are more charged inside <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> than outside. <b>The</b> <b>cell</b> {{membrane}} is permeable to non-ionized (fat-soluble) molecules; ionized (water-soluble) molecules cannot cross it easily. Once a non-charged molecule of a basic chemical crosses <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> membrane to enter <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> it becomes charged due to gaining a hydrogen ion because of the lower pH inside <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> and thus becomes unable to cross back. Because transmembrane equilibrium must be maintained, another unionized molecule must diffuse into <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> to repeat <b>the</b> process. Thus its concentration inside <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> increases many {{times that of the}} outside. The non-charged molecules of the drug remain in equal concentration on either side of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> membrane.|$|R
30|$|In {{diffusive}} MET, the mediators enter <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> membrane {{and exchange}} electrons between cellular metabolism inside <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> and <b>the</b> electrode outside it. In the non-diffusive MET, the mediator can collect the electrons from <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> membrane without penetrating <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|R
5|$|In small-cell lung {{carcinoma}} (SCLC), <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> contain dense neurosecretory granules (vesicles containing neuroendocrine hormones), {{which give}} this tumor an endocrine/paraneoplastic syndrome association.

Sixty to seventy percent have extensive disease (which cannot be targeted within a single radiation therapy field) at presentation.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about how ctenophores get rid of waste {{products}} produced by <b>the</b> <b>cells.</b> The ciliary rosettes in the gastrodermis may help to remove wastes from the mesoglea, and may also help to adjust the animal's buoyancy by pumping water into {{or out of the}} mesoglea.|$|E
5|$|Mosaicism in horses {{is thought}} to account for some {{spontaneous}} occurrences of white, near-white, spotted, and roan horses. Mosaicism refers to mutations that occur after the single-cell stage, and therefore affect {{only a portion of}} the adult cells. Mosaicism may be one possible cause for the rare occurrence of brindle coloring in horses. Mosaic-white horses would be visually indistinguishable from dominant whites. Mosaicism could produce white or partially white foals if a stem cell in the developing foal underwent a mutation, or change to the DNA, that resulted in unpigmented skin and hair. <b>The</b> <b>cells</b> that descend from the affected stem cell will exhibit the mutation, while the rest of <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> are unaffected.|$|E

Simulation models of IBC cells, not only helps in understanding <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> behaviour inline with the experimental results but also help further in predicting <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> performance, {{adding to the}} cost effectiveness in <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> processing. <b>The</b> paper initially analyses about <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> behavioural with varying <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> pitch size and then provides with a predictive analysis on <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> behaviour in relation with varying bulk resistivity...|$|R
50|$|The {{negative}} charge in <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> and ions outside <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> creates a thermodynamic potential; if damage occurs to <b>the</b> brain and <b>cells</b> lose their membrane integrity, ions will rush into <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> to balance chemical and electrical gradients {{that were previously}} established. The membrane voltage will become zero, but the chemical gradient will still exist. To neutralize the {{negative charge}}s within <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> cations flow in, which increases the osmotic pressure inside relative {{to the outside of}} <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> <b>The</b> increased osmotic pressure forces water to flow into <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> and tissue swelling occurs.|$|R
50|$|After a cell has {{established}} a resting potential, that <b>cell</b> has <b>the</b> capacity to undergo depolarization. During depolarization, the charge within <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> rapidly shifts from negative to positive. For this rapid change to take place within the interior of <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> several events must occur along the plasma membrane of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> as well. While the sodium potassium pump continues to work, the voltage gated ion channels that had been closed while <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> was at resting potential have been opened by an electrical stimulus. As the sodium rushes back into <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>the</b> positive sodium ions raise the charge inside <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> from negative to positive. Once the interior of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> becomes positively charged, depolarization of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> is complete.|$|R
5|$|Most Demospongiae have {{silicate}} spicules or spongin fibers or {{both within}} their soft tissues. However a few also have massive external skeletons made of aragonite, {{another form of}} calcium carbonate. All <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> have a single nucleus and membrane.|$|E
5|$|Release {{occurs when}} the new viruses escape or are {{released}} from the cell. Most viruses achieve this by making <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> burst, a process called lysis. Other viruses such as HIV are released more gently by a process called budding.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>cell</b> {{membrane}} is selectively permeable {{and able}} to regulate what enters and exits <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> thus facilitating <b>the</b> transport of materials needed for survival. The movement of substances across the membrane can be either [...] "passive", occurring without the input of cellular energy, or [...] "active", requiring <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> to expend energy in transporting it. The membrane also maintains <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> potential. <b>The</b> <b>cell</b> membrane thus works as a selective filter that allows only certain things to come inside or go outside <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cell</b> employs a number of transport mechanisms that involve biological membranes: ...|$|R
50|$|In some melanocytes, the melanosomes remain static within <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> In others <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> {{can extend}} its surface {{lengthwise}} as temporary projections known as pseudopodia, which carry melanosomes {{away from the}} center of <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> thereby increasing <b>the</b> <b>cell's</b> effectiveness in absorbing light.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{secondary}} <b>cell</b> wall is {{a structure}} found in many plant <b>cells,</b> located between <b>the</b> primary <b>cell</b> wall and <b>the</b> plasma membrane. <b>The</b> <b>cell</b> starts producing <b>the</b> secondary <b>cell</b> wall after <b>the</b> primary <b>cell</b> wall is complete and <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> has stopped expanding.|$|R
5|$|Sebum is {{produced}} in a holocrine process, in which cells within the sebaceous gland rupture and disintegrate as they release the sebum and the cell remnants are secreted together with the sebum. <b>The</b> <b>cells</b> are constantly replaced by mitosis {{at the base of}} the duct.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} main types of cytosis: {{endocytosis}} (into <b>the</b> <b>cell),</b> exocytosis (out of <b>the</b> <b>cell),</b> and transcytosis (through <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> in and out).|$|R
5000|$|If a {{plant cell}} {{is placed in}} a {{hypertonic}} solution, <b>the</b> plant <b>cell</b> loses water and hence turgor pressure by plasmolysis: pressure decreases {{to the point where}} the protoplasm of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> peels away from <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> wall, leaving gaps between <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> wall and <b>the</b> membrane and making <b>the</b> plant <b>cell</b> shrink and crumple. A continued decrease in pressure eventually leads to cytorrhysis - the complete collapse of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> wall. Plants with cells in this condition wilt. After plasmolysis the gap between <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> wall and <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> membrane in a plant cell is filled with hypertonic solution. This is because as the solution surrounding <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> is hypertonic, exosmosis takes place and the space between <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> wall and cytoplasm is filled with solutes, as most of the water drains away and hence the concentration inside <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> becomes more hypertonic. There are some mechanisms in plants to prevent excess water loss in the same way as excess water gain. Plasmolysis can be reversed if <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> is placed in a hypotonic solution. Stomata help keep water in the plant so it does not dry out. Wax also keeps water in the plant. The equivalent process in animal cells is called crenation. The liquid content of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> leaks out due to exosmosis. <b>The</b> <b>cell</b> collapses, and <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> membrane pulls away from <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> wall (in plants). Most animal cells consist of only a phospholipid bilayer (plasma membrane) and not a cell wall, therefore shrinking up under such conditions.|$|R
25|$|Adaptive cells {{change their}} absorption/reflection {{characteristics}} depending {{to respond to}} environmental conditions. An adaptive material responds to the intensity and angle of incident light. At the part of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> where <b>the</b> light is most intense, <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> surface changes from reflective to adaptive, allowing the light to penetrate <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> <b>The</b> other parts of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> remain reflective increasing the retention of the absorbed light within <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|R

40|$|A cell buffer with {{built-in}} testing mechanism is provided. <b>The</b> <b>cell</b> buffer provides <b>the</b> ability to measure voltage {{provided by a}} power <b>cell.</b> <b>The</b> testing mechanism provides the ability to test whether <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> buffer is functioning properly and thus providing an accurate voltage measurement. The testing mechanism includes a test signal-provider to provide a test signal to <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> buffer. During normal operation, the test signal is disabled and <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> buffer operates normally. During testing, the test signal is enabled and changes the output of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> buffer in a defined way.
