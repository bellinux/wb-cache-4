40|$|Drawing {{on prior}} {{research}} on staffing sufficiency theory, {{we hypothesized that}} individuals working in understaffed groups would experience higher levels of perceived task scope and utilization of skills, and that these <b>task</b> <b>perceptions</b> would lead {{to higher levels of}} organizational commitment and work performance. Data were gatheredfrom 684 workers from 160 blue-collar groups and 55 white-collar groups. Our path analyses indicated that moderate levels of understaffing were associated with higher levels of <b>task</b> <b>perceptions</b> and commitmentfor both blue-collar and white-collar individuals. But only for the white-collar sample did <b>task</b> <b>perceptions,</b> in turn, lead to higher performance. At the group level of analysis, however, understaffing was associated with lower levels of group performance. We suggest that these findings have important implications for organizations and epartments that are considering structural downsizing. Early work by Barker and his colleagues (Barker & Wright, 1955; Barker, 1960; Barker & Gump, 1964; Barker, 1968) on Behavior Setting Theory has prompted a number of studies {{in the past few years}} on the effects of understaffing on employees ’ attitudes and behavior (e. g., Greenberg, 1979; Greenberg, Wang & Dossett, 1982; Oxley & Barrera, 1984). Barker’s original treatise is grounded in an ecological psychology perspective that argues for the behavioral influence of extra-individual phenomena. In essence, ecological psychology dictates that in order to study environment-behavior relationships, the environment (i. e., a function of objective reality) and the behavior (i. e., a function of perceptions flowing from one’s psychological life space) must be described and measured independently. The major environmental unit of interest in this theory is wha...|$|E

This paper {{presents}} a task-based user study {{carried out to}} investigate how explicit roles assigned to group members affected col-laborative information seeking behaviour during a travel planning task. 24 pairs participated our study where half of them were given a specific instruction to divide the roles into a searcher and writer, while others were given no such instruction. The evaluation looked at travel plans generated, search interaction logs, <b>task</b> <b>perceptions,</b> and dialogues be-tween members. The results suggest that explicit division of roles can have significant effect son a group’s knowledge building during the col-laborative search task.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{literature}} {{provides some}} insight into the role of feedback givers, but little information about within-trainer factors influencing 'feedback-giving behaviours'. We looked for relationships between characteristics of feedback givers (self-efficacy, <b>task</b> <b>perception,</b> neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness) and elements of observation and feedback (frequency, quality of content and consequential impact). METHODS: We developed and tested several hypotheses regarding the characteristics and elements in a cross-sectional digital survey among GP trainers and their trainees in 2011 and 2012. We conducted bivariate analysis using Pearson correlations and performed multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-two trainer-trainee couples from three Dutch institutions for postgraduate GP training participated in the study. Trainer scores on 'task perception' and on a scale of the trait 'neuroticism' correlated positively with frequency of feedback and quality of feedback content. Multiple regression analysis supported positive correlations between <b>task</b> <b>perception</b> and frequency of feedback and between neuroticism and quality of feedback content. No other correlations were found. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to the literature on feedback giving by revealing factors that influence feedback-giving behaviour, namely neuroticism and <b>task</b> <b>perception.</b> Trainers whose <b>task</b> <b>perception</b> included facilitation of observation and feedback (<b>task</b> <b>perception)</b> and trainers who were concerned about the safety of their patients during consultations with trainees (neuroticism) engaged more frequently in observation and feedback and gave feedback of higher quality...|$|R

Although metacognitive behaviors have been linked to L 2 writing proficiency and performance, there is still the need for an account of how and why different metacognitive behaviors can help L 2 academic writers to apply genre knowledge in authentic situations. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, this study borrows the framework of calibration from educational psychology to highlight the relationship between the accuracy of graduate students’ metacognitive judgments and the quality of their texts. Within an authentic setting, the nature of metacognitive judgments is calibrated against the assessment of rhetorical effectiveness by teacher raters using genre analysis criteria. Findings show that individual differences in rhetorical effectiveness can be better understood when accuracy of metacognitive judgments is considered along two qualitative dimensions: depth and alignment. Differential achievement relates to the ability to apply genre knowledge to the text, and misalignments in <b>task</b> <b>perceptions</b> and criteria.

40|$|Purpose-The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effects of {{asymmetric}} perceptions of task conflict (i. e. one person experiencing more conflict than the other) on the anticipated relationship with the partner, as well as subjective and objective performance. Design/methodology/approach–In a 2 = 2 between-participants experimental design, we manipulated participants’ perception of task conflict (perceive task conflict vs does not perceive task conflict) and the perceptual conflict composition of their group (asymmetry vs symmetry). Participants were randomly allocated to each of the four experimental conditions. Eighty-four psychology students at a Dutch university participated (25 men and 59 women; average age= 21). Findings-Results show that when individuals realize that they have asymmetric task conflict perceptions, they have lower expectations about having a positive relationship with their partner and perform worse compared to when they have symmetric <b>task</b> <b>perceptions</b> (i. e. both experiencing either low or high levels of conflict). Originality/value-Past research on conflict has not often taken into account that individuals involved in a conflict can experience different amounts of conflict. By conducting an experimental study, in contrast to past research on conflict asymmetry, we can better understand the causal relationship between (a) symmetry of conflict and outcomes. We also provide insight into the mediating chain that examines how conflict asymmetry interferes with work processes and leads to negative work outcomes...|$|E

OBJECTIVE: To know how <b>task</b> <b>perceptions,</b> perceptions of own ability and perceived barriers regarding nutrition education and treatment of overweight of Dutch GPs have developed from 1992 to 2007. METHODS: In all, 488 GPs, first included in study in 1992, were asked in 2007 to return the Wageningen PCPs Nutritional Practices Questionnaire. Crohnbach's alphas and sum scores were calculated and differences between 1992 and 2007 were investigated using a paired t-test. RESULTS: In all, 247 GPs responded (51 %). 'Noticing patients overweight and guidance of treatment' did not change in GPs from 1992 to 2007. The task perception about health education and prevention did not change and the perception of daily activities shifted from the curative to the preventive side. Interest in the influence of nutrition on health increased in 2007. GPs less often managed to counsel on nutrition in daily practice. Their perceived capacity to counsel and their self-efficacy regarding overweight management declined over the years. In 2007, more GPs perceived the barriers 'lack of time' to treat overweight and to give nutrition education. The most important barrier in 2007 was lack of patient motivation. CONCLUSIONS: The GPs perceived overweight and nutrition education as important and were still favourable towards prevention. However, their potential to give nutrition education or guide in treatment of overweight was not fully utilized because of decreased self-efficacy factors and perceived barriers...|$|E

Here, we further investigated this hypothesis by submitting adult participants to three types of numerical estimation task: 1) a <b>perception</b> <b>task,</b> in which participants had to estimate the numerosity of a non-symbolic collection; 2) a production task, in which participants had to approximately produce the numerosity of a symbolic numerical input; 3) a reproduction task, in which participants had to reproduce the numerosity of a non-symbolic numerical input. Our results gave further support to the finding that different patterns of performance are found according to the type of estimation task: 1) under-estimation in the perception task; 2) over-estimation in the production task; 3) accurate estimation in the reproduction task. Moreover, correlation analyses revealed that the more a participant under-estimated in the <b>perception</b> <b>task,</b> the more he/she over-estimated in the production task.

We designed an implementation strategy, based on peer assessment (PA) focusing on barriers to change in physical therapy care. A previously published randomized controlled trial showed that PA was {{more effective than the}} usual strategy "case discussion" in improving adherence to a low back pain guideline. Peer assessment aims to enhance knowledge, communication, and hands-on clinical skills consistent with guideline recommendations. Participants observed and evaluated clinical performance on the spot in a role-play simulating clinical practice. Participants performed three roles: physical therapist, assessor, and patient. This study explored the critical features of the PA program that contributed to improved guideline adherence in the perception of participants. METHODS: Dutch physical therapists working in primary care (n = 49) organized in communities of practice (n = 6) participated in the PA program. By unpacking the program we identified three main tasks and eleven subtasks. After the program was finished, a questionnaire was administered in which participants were asked to rank the program tasks from high to low learning value and to describe their impact on performance improvement. Overall ranking results were calculated. Additional semi-structured interviews were conducted to elaborate on the questionnaires results and were transcribed verbatim. Questionnaires comments and interview transcripts were analyzed using template analysis. RESULTS: Program tasks related to performance in the therapist role were perceived to have the highest impact on learning, although <b>task</b> <b>perceptions</b> varied from challenging to threatening. Perceptions were affected by the role-play format and the time schedule. Learning outcomes were awareness of performance, improved attitudes towards the guideline, and increased self-efficacy beliefs in managing patients with low back pain. Learning was facilitated by psychological safety and the quality of feedback. CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of PA {{can be attributed to the}} structured and performance-based design of the program. Participants showed a strong cognitive and emotional commitment to performing the physical therapist role. That might have contributed to an increased awareness of strength and weakness in clinical performance and a motivation to change routine practice...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Promotion of {{nutrition}} {{and physical activity}} is important {{to slow down the}} increase of overweight. General practitioners (GPs) are in an unique position to communicate with their patients about nutrition and physical activity, because of the high referral score, high perceived expertise and reach to nearly all segments of the population. Our research group has a large history in the field {{of nutrition}} guidance practices by GPs. The aim of the present study is to gain insight into the similarities and differences in patterns between nutrition and physical activity guidance practices by GPs. Methods: In 1992, a mail questionnaire (The Wageningen GPs Nutritional Practices Questionnaire) was developed and sent to a nationwide sample of 1000 Dutch GPs, who had 5 - 15 years of practice experience. Altogether, 633 GPs participated. All eligible 488 participants from 1992 were asked to participate again in the 2007 study. In total, 255 GPs (in practice for 20 - 30 years) returned the questionnaire. The response rate appeared to be 52 %. Additionally, a new cohort of GPs was asked to fill in the questionnaire, resulting in another 217 GPs in practice for 5 - 20 years. The questionnaire was developed on the basis of qualitative research. Self-reported nutrition guidance practices, <b>task</b> <b>perceptions,</b> self-efficacy expectations and perceived barriers regarding this practices were assessed in the questionnaire. In 2007, the questionnaire also included questions about physical activity guidance practices and its determinants. This makes it possible to study whether GPs, who are communicating about nutrition, are the same GPs, who communicate about physical activity. In addition, special attention has been given to literature reviews about nutrition and physical activity guidance practices by GPs. Results: Around 80 % of GPs mentioned that they often noticed their patients’ weight. Our study showed that GPs are more likely to communicate with overweight patients about physical activity than about nutrition. Moreover, GPs perceived their tasks concerning physical activity guidance more preventive than their tasks concerning nutrition guidance. Also, self-efficacy for physical activity guidance appeared to be higher than for nutrition guidance. Furthermore, 71 % of GPs perceived lack of time as barrier for nutrition guidance, although only 54 % mentioned this as barrier for physical activity guidance. Conclusions: This study indicates that Dutch GPs are more often inclined to promote physical activity than to promote nutrition to overweight patients. Likewise, they tend to rate determinants of physical activity guidance more positively than determinants of nutrition guidance. The preliminary results of in-depth analysis of the similarities and differences between nutrition and physical activity guidance practices will be discussed at the conference...|$|E

Thirty-four TD Italian children aged 8 - 10 completed two specifically designed tasks: a production <b>task</b> and a <b>perception</b> <b>task.</b> Both tasks used nonwords containing clusters consisting of plosive plus liquid (eg. pl). Clusters could be either in a stressed or in an unstressed syllable, and could be either in initial position (first syllable) or in medial position (second syllable). In the production task children were asked to repeat the non-words. In the <b>perception</b> <b>task,</b> the children were asked to discriminate between two nonwords differing in one phoneme belonging to a cluster by reporting whether two repetitions were the same or different. Results from the production task showed that children are more accurate in repeating stressed than unstressed syllables, but there was no difference with respect to position of the cluster. Results from the <b>perception</b> <b>task</b> showed that children performed more accurately when discriminating word initial contrasts than when discriminating word medial contrasts, especially if the cluster was unstressed. Implications of this finding for clinical assessments are discussed...|$|R
