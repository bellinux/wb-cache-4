25|$|Through Sir Spencer Ponsonby-Fane Brympton d'Evercy {{became a}} meeting place of cricket lovers. It had its own cricket pitch where large house parties played against local and visiting teams. A houseparty devoted to cricket took place each year, a {{tradition}} which survived long after Sir Spencer's death and into the 1950s. As treasurer of the MCC Sir Spencer laid the foundation stone for the pavilion at Lord's. He founded the Old Stagers club of Canterbury, and most eccentrically the team known as I Zingari, a wandering cricket club of assorted aristocrats and Victorian and Edwardian notables. Throughout Sir Spencer's ownership of Brympton the house and estate were maintained, but survived only through {{the good fortune of}} low taxation and agricultural rents. This branch of the Fane family had never been wealthy, and World War I was to bring sweeping changes <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> Brympton d'Evercy but country houses all over Britain.|$|E

500|$|The main {{theme of}} the novel is drugs, which Faulks said came partly from the {{timeframe}} of the novel and partly from Fleming not using it as a major theme: [...] "1967, the summer of love... Drugs were first coming to public notice. The Stones were busted, and there was that famous leader in The Times. And, you know, {{what are we talking about}} now all the time? Drugs. It's still very resonant. And there's little about drug-dealing in Fleming. It's not something he did in any depth." [...] Faulks also wanted to broaden the aspect of the story compared to Fleming: [...] "The book is set during the Cold War and I wanted it <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> be a crime story but to also have a political background. I was also determined that although the book is set in 1967, I wanted the issues that it touches on to still be alive to us today".|$|E

500|$|While it is {{sometimes}} assumed, particularly in the United States, to have been borrowed from Arabic political discourse, its evolution has followed a circular course from Arabic to English and then back. Lebanese newspapers began referring to just [...] "the street" [...] during the 1950s; later in the decade reports in The New York Times used the term in English to explain Gamal Abdel Nasser's broad appeal not just in his native Egypt but across the Arab world. Later commentators added the [...] "Arab" [...] and eventually dropped the scare quotes to create the current usage, which became widespread in American media during the First Palestinian Intifada in 1987. Arab media began using it themselves a decade later. However, its usage still differs between the two languages. In the Western English-language media, only Arab popular sentiment {{is referred to as}} the [...] "street"; Arabic commentators use the expression in the same sense to refer <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> public opinion in their countries but in the West as well.|$|E
500|$|The Tempest, Hazlitt claims, {{is one of}} Shakespeare's [...] "most {{original}} and perfect" [...] plays, {{similar in some ways}} to A Midsummer Night's Dream but finer as a play, if not as rich in poetic passages. The Tempest demonstrates the author to be a master of both comedy and tragedy, with a full command over [...] "all the resources of passion, of wit, of thought, of observation". Yet again, Hazlitt here devotes considerable space <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> the characters in the play, but the character of the play as a whole. The world of the play seems to be created out of nothing; yet, though dream-like, in large part a product of the imagination, its setting resembles that of a painting we may have seen—"Prospero's enchanted island [...] airy music, the tempest-tost vessel, the turbulent waves, all have the effect of the landscape background of some fine picture"—its poetry having a music that conjures up meaning in the listener's mind—"the songs [...] without conveying any distinct images, seem to recall all the feelings connected with them, like snatches of half-forgotten music heard indistinctly and at intervals"—and its characters, many of whom, like Ariel, we know could not really exist, are drawn so as to seem [...] "as true and natural as [...] real characters". All is so artfully unified that [...] "that part which is only the fantastic creation of his mind, has the same palpable texture, and coheres 'semblably' with the rest." ...|$|E

500|$|Celilo Falls and The Dalles were {{strategically}} {{located at}} the border between Chinookan and Sahaptian speaking peoples and served {{as the center of}} an extensive trading network across the Pacific Plateau. Artifacts from the original village site at Celilo suggest that trade goods came {{from as far away as}} the Great Plains, Southwestern United States, and Alaska. There are also numerous rock art drawings at the head of the falls. This demonstrates the site <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> be important for trading purposes. It acted as a melting pot for the cultures which fished and traded there. When the Lewis and Clark expedition passed through the area in 1805, the explorers found a [...] "great emporium…where all the neighboring nations assemble," [...] and a population density unlike anything they had seen on their journey. Accordingly, historians have likened the Celilo area to the “Wall Street of the West." [...] The Wishram people lived on the north bank, while the Wasco lived on the south bank, with the most intense bargaining occurring at the Wishram village of Nix-luidix. Charles Wilkes reported finding three major native fishing sites on the lower Columbia — Celilo Falls, the Big Dalles, and Cascades Rapids, with the Big Dalles being the largest. Alexander Ross described it as the [...] "great rendezvous" [...] of native traders, as [...] "the great emporium or mart of the Columbia." [...] Pinnipeds such as sea lions and seals followed salmon up the Columbia as far as Celilo Falls. In 1841 George Simpson wrote [...] "these animals ascend the Columbia in great numbers in quest of the salmon.|$|E
500|$|It was {{not easy}} for the HBC to drive the Americans away from the North West Coast. The Americans had decades of {{experience}} and knew the coast's complex physical and human geography. It took until 1835 for the HBC to gain this level of experience, but the Americans still had several advantages. For {{a number of reasons}} they were willing and able to pay high prices for furs—much higher than the HBC could match without taking large financial losses. The American ventures were global in scope. They tapped multiple markets of which the North West Coast was but one. By the 1820s American ships routinely spent years in the Pacific, making several voyages between various places such as California, Hawaii, the Philippines, and Canton. American ships were usually stocked with a surplus of trade goods intended for trade on the North West Coast. It was always best to get rid of any extra trade goods on the North West Coast, [...] "dumping" [...] them at any price, before leaving. They would use up stowage space that could be used more profitably elsewhere. The HBC therefore faced a major challenge even after they became experienced with the coast's geography and indigenous peoples. The American system not only raised the price of furs but also lowered the value of trade goods. Furthermore, the indigenous people knew that increased competition served their interests and gave them bargaining power. They had no desire to see the Americans abandon the coast trade. Therefore, the HBC had <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> match but exceed the prices paid by Americans if they hoped to drive the Americans away. Beaver fur prices on the coast could be many times what the HBC was paying in the interior. There was no hope of making a profit. In order to compete on the coast the HBC had to take large, long-term financial losses.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} varieties of anglicisms which are largely differentiated on {{the way in which they}} entered the language. One type of anglicism is a calque, or a direct translation from English. For example, the valediction Sincèrement vôtre is regarded as an anglicism since it is a direct translation of the English [...] "Sincerely yours." [...] Other anglicisms include the wholesale adoption of the English term such as [...] "business" [...] or [...] "start-up". Additionally, some English words in French may not have the same meaning as those words in English. One example is the word [...] "golf" [...] which has an increased semantic field, referring <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> the game of golf but also a golf course as in [...] "on va aller au golf" [...] (trans: we're going to the golf course).|$|E

[...] Katherine Dacey also praised the [...] "intensely Romantic quality of all three stories" [...] and their artwork, particularly Hagio's representation of the characters' memories and emotional states with [...] "symbolically rich imagery" [...] and a [...] "dream-like quality". Dacey cited Hagio's [...] "unique ability to mix the sublime with the ridiculous", such as the characters' names and costumes and the sex-change drug.|$|E
2500|$|Paula Jefferson, head of Beachcroft LLP's Disease Group, said: [...] "Any {{organisation}} {{involved in}} any activity in the future, where there {{is the potential for}} release of harmful substances in to the atmosphere, should ensure that they have taken all necessary steps to identify the potential contamination and to then ensure that they either employ, or have themselves the necessary skills, to deal with that contamination. The principles in the judgment apply not just when there is demolition in progress, but to any activity where there is potential for exposure in to the atmosphere. Where there is any known potential for such exposure, then regard should be had <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> the onsite workforce but also to those living and working in the surrounding area. In the Corby case the area of risk was 4km from the demolition site. The area for potential exposure will clearly vary depending on the circumstances of each case. In essence, the message remains the same - proper risk assessment is key and must include identifying the appropriate people to do the job and not cutting corners, which, as has been proved for Corby Borough Council, is likely to be false economy." ...|$|E
