5|$|Ward LeRoy Churchill (born 1947) is {{an author}} and {{political}} activist. He was a professor of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado Boulder from 1990 until 2007. <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> of his work is on the historical treatment of political dissenters and Native Americans by the United States government. His work features controversial and provocative views, written in a direct, often confrontational style.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, {{construction}} resumed on roadways throughout Ontario. The expressway between Highland Creek and Oshawa {{was completed}} in December 1947, while other sections languished. The Toronto–Barrie Highway was <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> of the Department of Highways at the time, and {{the onset of the}} Korean War in 1950 stalled construction again. Despite the delays, highway minister George Doucett officially announced the plans for construction of the new trans-provincial expressway that year, with the Toronto to Oshawa expressway serving {{as a model for the}} design. Work on the most important link, the Toronto Bypass, began in 1951, but it would not open with that name.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the last}} incarcerees left in 1945, former incarcerees {{and others have}} worked to protect Manzanar and to {{establish}} it as a National Historic Site {{to ensure that the}} history of the site, along with the stories of those who were unjustly incarcerated there, are remembered by current and future generations. <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> is the Japanese American incarceration era, as specified in the legislation that created the Manzanar National Historic Site. The site also interprets the former town of Manzanar, the ranch days, the settlement by the Owens Valley Paiute, and the role that water played in shaping the history of the Owens Valley.|$|E
40|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>foci</b> of phytophthora. {{could be}} found in potato fields {{originating}} from diseased tubers and on refuse heaps. In De Streek (North Holland) the very susceptible variety Eersteling had I <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> per 80 ha of potatoes. Infection from refuse heaps was there of minor importance. Only a small proportion of diseased tubers planted gave a <b>primary</b> <b>focus.</b> Spread from <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>foci</b> was studied. Epidemics of phytophthora. under the prevailing weather conditions could be easily explained by spread from <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>foci.</b> 'Field resistance' of the varieties plays a main role in epidemics. A method for testing it in the greenhouse was worked out. The disease could be controlled not only by spraying but also by careful inspection of seed potatoes and by eradication of <b>primary</b> <b>foci</b> in field and on refuse heaps. Heat treatment of tubers killed the fungus, but would hardly be applicable in practice. <p/...|$|R

5|$|The {{aircraft}} was initially {{powered by the}} Pegasus 6 engine which {{was replaced by the}} more powerful Pegasus 11 during the Harrier GR.1 to GR.3 upgrade process. <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> throughout the engine's development was on achieving high performance with as little weight as possible, tempered by the amount of funding that was available. Following the Harrier's entry to service the focus switched to improving reliability and extending engine life; a formal joint US–UK Pegasus Support Program operated for many years and spent a £3-million annual budget to develop engine improvements. Several variants have been released; the latest is the Pegasus 11–61 (Mk 107), which provides 23,800lbf (106kN) thrust, more than any previous engine.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Italian Heavy Draft's early {{popularity}} as {{a strong}} but fast draft horse, increasing mechanization in the farming and military sectors reduced the need for all draft horses, and population numbers declined. In the 1970s, selection processes were changed {{to focus on the}} production of animals for horse meat, and that has continued to be <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> through the present time. In 1976, a breed association was formed in Italy to preserve and promote the Italian Heavy Draft. The association is charged with maintaining the stud book, evaluating breeding stock, granting equine passports, maintaining genetic databases, and exhibiting the breed. The main breeding areas for the Italian Heavy Draft are in the plains and hills around Verona, Padova, Vicenza, Venice, Treviso and Udine. In 2005, it was estimated that there were just under 6,500 Italian Heavy Drafts, about half of which were mares. The registered population at the end of 2010 was 6304, with the largest numbers in Lazio and Umbria; the number of unregistered Heavy Drafts is not reported.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} half of the 20th century, due to a {{widespread}} distrust of permanent military forces in Australia, the reserve military forces were <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> of Australian military planning. Following the end of World War II, however, this focus gradually shifted due to the changing strategic environment, and the requirement for a higher readiness force available to support collective security goals. Since then, Australian defence policy has been focused more upon the Regular Army, and there has been considerable debate about the role of the Army Reserve within defence planning circles. As the strategic situation has evolved in the post Cold War era, the organisation, structure, training and role of the Army Reserve has undergone considerable changes, and members of the Army Reserve are increasingly being used on overseas deployments, not only within Regular Army units, but also in units drawn almost entirely from Reserve units.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was also}} positively received; for example, Hendrix from GamePro shared his {{opinion that the}} game did well with management of the games time. Nelson and Hendrix from IGN and GamePro both emphasized their enjoyment of the games action elements. GameSpot, while feeling that the action elements were <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> of the game, still liked {{the wide variety of}} role-playing elements present. Nelson from IGN, however, wished that the role-playing elements had been reduced even further in favor of the action parts of the game. All three reviewers compared the game to The Legend of Zelda, such as Mielke from GameSpot who had discussed the game to release as a direct competitor to that series. Both GameSpot and IGN felt that the comparison was invalid, as Musashi focused much more on action than role-playing, resulting in a game that was not a direct competitor at all.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> of {{the society}} at this time was simple subsistence. To {{continue}} as a group, they had to focus all of their energies on producing food. This was problematic {{because many of the}} members were becoming old and several suffered illnesses. Since the beginning, Beilhart and the other members had not actively sought out new members, believing that a small group was more viable. This proved to be their undoing as there were no younger members to sustain the farm. The original members, who had stayed with the group since its inception, began to leave and by 1928, only six were left. Financial strains forced them to relinquish the ranch and move to a house in the village of Soquel.|$|E
5|$|The primary freeway {{running through}} Lewisville is Interstate 35E, which runs north–south through the city. Before it was built, US Highway 77 (now Mill Street) {{was the main}} through route, {{connecting}} the city with Denton {{to the north and}} Dallas to the south. In 1998, the Texas Department of Transportation carried out a Major Investment Study to examine the possibility of expanding the section of Interstate 35E between Interstate 635 and U.S. Route 380, <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> being an stretch from Texas State Highway 121 to the bridge crossing Lewisville Lake. The project is scheduled to add one general-purpose lane in each direction, in addition to a managed toll lane. The project is expected to allow the city to substantially renovate its portion of the I-35 Corridor. Construction on {{the first phase of the}} project is projected to begin in summer 2013 and finish in late 2016.|$|E

Alan is also shown a police report of an accident where an acquaintance of his had died in an accident due to his reckless driving. Filling out the film is a nostalgic {{look back at the}} early 1900s, when such things as horseless carriages were parts of everyday life and four-lane superhighways—in the late 1950s still a relatively new concept—weren't even thought of, and slower and less congested roadways meant fewer dangers in driving; however, Hal cautions that his point is that the human body hasn't changed and that even more attention to safety must be heeded.|$|E
