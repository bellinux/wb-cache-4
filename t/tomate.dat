Mexican singer-songwriter Marco Antonio Solís became the first performer to peak at number one 4 times in the same calendar year: twice as the lead member of Los Bukis and twice as a solo artist with La Historia Continúa... and Tu Amor o Tu Desprecio. Ranchero performer Pepe Aguilar debuted at number two on the chart on April 12, 2003 with Y Tenerte Otra Vez and the following week climbed to number one.|$|E
2500|$|This {{tradition}} has persisted {{to the present}} day, even though Flamenco is now legitimate. [...] Sometimes the artistic name consists of the home town appended to the first name (Manolo Sanlúcar, Ramón de Algeciras); but many, perhaps most, of such names are more eccentric: Pepe de la Matrona (because {{his mother was a}} midwife); Perico del Lunar (because he had a mole); Tomatito (son of a father known as <b>Tomate</b> (tomato) because of his red face); Sabicas (because of his childhood passion for green beans, from niño de las habicas); Paco de Lucía, born Francisco ("Paco") Gustavo Sánchez Gomes, was known from infancy after his Portuguese mother, Lucía Gomes (de Lucía = [...] of Lucía). And many more.|$|E
2500|$|Monochrome {{painting}} was initiated {{at the first}} Incoherent arts' exhibition in 1882 in Paris, with a black painting by poet Paul Bilhaud entitled [...] "Combat de Nègres dans un tunnel" [...] (Negroes fight in a tunnel). (Although Bilhaud {{was not the first}} to create an all-black artwork: for example, Robert Fludd published an image of [...] "Darkness" [...] in his 1617 book on the origin and structure of the cosmos; and [...] published his black Vue de La Hogue (effet de nuit) in 1843.) [...] In the subsequent exhibitions of the Incoherent arts (also in the 1880s) the writer Alphonse Allais proposed other monochrome paintings, such as [...] "Première communion de jeunes filles chlorotiques par un temps de neige" [...] ("First communion of anaemic young girls in the snow", white), or [...] "Récolte de la <b>tomate</b> par des cardinaux [...] apoplectiques au bord de la Mer Rouge" [...] ("Tomato harvesting by apoplectic cardinals on the shore of the Red Sea", red). [...] Allais published his Album primo-avrilesque in 1897, a monograph with seven monochrome artworks. [...] However, this kind of activity bears more similarity to 20th century Dada, or Neo-Dada, and particularly the works of the Fluxus group of the 1960s, than to 20th century monochrome painting since Malevich.|$|E

40|$|The {{physicochemical}} {{characteristics of the}} cherry tomato cultivated in organic and conventional production systems and harvested at either 30 or 45 days of cropping were evaluated using a randomized, 2 x 2 factorial design (2 cropping systems x 2 harvesting times) with five repetitions. The parameters analyzed were color, centesimal composition, total energetic value, carotenoids and bioactive amine content. Tomatoes harvested at 30 days had higher total soluble solid (TSS) content when grown conventionally, but when harvested at 45 days, both conventional and organic tomatoes had similar TSS values, probably due to increased N availability in the soil. Organic cherry tomatoes had higher contents of &# 946;-carotene, lycopene and bioactive amine. On the other hand, tomatoes from conventional cropping were more alkaline and brighter. In conclusion, organic tomatoes are more nutritious than conventional varieties, and if allowed to ripen for up to 45 days, contain higher levels of TSS, carotenoids and total bioactive amines. As características físico-químicas de <b>tomates</b> cereja cutivados em sistema orgânico e convencional e colhidos em 30 ou 45 dias de cultivo foram avaliadas em um delineamento casualizado, fatorial 2 x 2 (2 sistemas de cultivo x 2 épocas de colheita) com cinco repetições. Foram analisados os parâmetros cor, composição centesimal, valor energético total e conteúdo de carotenóides e de aminas bioativas. <b>Tomates</b> colhidos em 30 dias tiveram maior conteúdo de sólidos solúveis totais (SST), possivelmente devido ao aumento de disponibilidade de N no solo. Os <b>tomates</b> orgânicos tiveram maior conteúdo de &# 946;-caroteno, licopeno e aminas bioativas. Por outro lado, os <b>tomates</b> convencionais foram menos ácidos e tiveram maior brilho. Conclui-se que <b>tomates</b> orgânicos são mais nutritivos que os convencionais, e se amadurecerem até 45 dias concentram maior teor de SST, carotenóides e aminas bioativas totais...|$|R

50|$|A key {{component}} of an initiative to construct the new Veterans International Bridge at Los <b>Tomates</b> was the careful coordination among U.S. and Mexican local, state, and federal agencies. The Interstate 69E/U.S. Highway 77/83 Los <b>Tomates</b> Expressway Extension project linking Brownsville, Texas, with Matamoros, Mexico, included new, elevated main lanes; construction of frontage roads; and improvements to the International Boulevard intersection. Other significant aspects of the project were the relocation and {{construction of a new}} 47 acre (19-hectare) park and the dedication of a new 175 acre (71-hectare) wildlife preserve. With the completion of the bridge and 10 other projects, international trucking can now bypass the heavily congested downtown corridors of Brownsville and Matamoros.|$|R

Os frutos foram classificados em: grupos, oblongo e redondo; subgrupos: verde maduro, pintado, rosado, vermelho e vermelho maduro e classes: gigante, grande, médio e pequeno. De acordo com a ocorrência de defeitos graves e leves nos frutos, os <b>tomates</b> foram classificados também em tipos: extra, especial ou selecionado e comercial. As amostras cultivadas no sistema convencional foram classificadas como do grupo redondo e plurilocular, enquanto que as do sistema orgânico do grupo oblongo e bilocular.

The {{objective}} of this work was the classification of the tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) cultivated in the organic and conventional cropping systems and commercialized in the Metropolitan Area of Curitiba. Six samples of conventionally grown tomatoes and three samples of organic tomatoes were evaluated. The fruits were classified in groups (oblong and round), subgroups (mature green, breaker, pink, red and mature red), and classes (giant, big, medium and small). According to the occurrence of serious damage and small defects on the fruits, they were classified in types, which can be extra, special or selected and commercial. The samples of conventional systems were classified as round and with than two locules, while of organic systems was classified as oblong and with two locules. Concerning the classes, the medium fruits predominated in the pink and red subgroups. All the samples were classified as out of standard or type due to the occurrence of defects...|$|R
