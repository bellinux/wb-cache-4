5|$|Eshmun was {{identified}} with Asclepius {{as a result}} of the Hellenic influence over Phoenicia; the earliest evidence of this equation is given by coins from Amrit and Acre from the third century BC. <b>This</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> exemplified by the Hellenized names of the Awali river which was dubbed Asclepius fluvius, and the Eshmun Temple's surrounding groves, known as the groves of Asclepius.|$|E
5|$|Figs {{flower and}} fruit asynchronously. Flowering and fruiting is {{staggered}} throughout the population. <b>This</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> important for fig wasps—female wasps {{need to find}} a syconium in which to lay their eggs within a few days of emergence, something that would not be possible if all the trees in a population flowered and fruited at the same time. This also makes figs important food resources for frugivores (animals that feed nearly exclusively on fruit); figs {{are one of the few}} fruit available at times of the year when fruit are scarce.|$|E

5|$|When {{diamonds}} {{are grown}} by the high-pressure high-temperature technique, nickel, cobalt {{or some other}} metals are usually added into the growth medium to facilitate catalytically the conversion of graphite into diamond. As a result, metallic inclusions are formed. Besides, isolated nickel and cobalt atoms incorporate into diamond lattice, as demonstrated through characteristic hyperfine structure in electron paramagnetic resonance, optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra, and the concentration of isolated nickel can reach 0.01%. <b>This</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> by all means unusual considering the large difference in size between carbon and transition metal atoms and the superior rigidity of the diamond lattice.|$|E
5|$|With {{the obvious}} {{exception}} of Brancaccio, all the singers in the concerto were female sopranos. Although the music {{written for the}} concerto focused on high voices, {{there is no evidence}} that the ensemble used either castrati or falsettists. <b>This</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> surprising, considering that castrati were shortly to become the biggest stars of a new art form, opera. In 1607, Monteverdi's Orfeo featured four castrato roles out of a cast of nine, showing the new dominance of this vocal type. It also contrasts with Margherita's father's court, where Guglielmo Gonzaga actively sought out eunuchs.|$|E
5|$|The {{portrait}} {{depicts the}} tensions and manoeuvrings of 16th century court politics. The deep red background and heavy brushstrokes establish an anxious and tense atmosphere, and the uneasy {{relationship between the}} Pope and his suitors. The pope is old, ill and tired and, to some critics' eyes, glares at Ottavio in an accusatory manner. His hat or camauro cloaks his baldness, but there are tell-tale signs of age in his long nose, dark beady eyes, stooped shoulders and long uneven beard. He is noticeably older than in the second Naples portrait of 1543. <b>This</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> reinforced by the clock placed {{on the table beside}} him, which serves both as a memento mori and a reminder that time is running out. Given this, the presence of his grandsons indicates that the commission was prompted by thoughts of succession.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the nature and}} {{limitations}} of the maritime technology of the age meant that the neither the Byzantines nor any of their opponents could develop a true thalassocracy. Galley fleets were confined to coastal operations, and {{were not able to}} play a truly independent role. Furthermore, as the alternation of Byzantine victories and defeats against the Arabs illustrates, no side was able to permanently gain the upper hand. Although the Byzantines pulled off a number of spectacular successes, such as Nasar's remarkable night-time victory in 880 (one of a handful of similar engagements in the Middle Ages), these victories were balanced off by similarly disastrous losses. Reports of mutinies by oarsmen in Byzantine fleets also reveal that conditions were often far from the ideal prescribed in the manuals. Combined with the traditional predominance of the great Anatolian land-holders in the higher military and civil offices, all this meant that, as in the Roman Empire, the navy, even at its height, was still regarded largely as an adjunct to the land forces. <b>This</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> clearly illustrated by the relatively lowly positions its admirals held in the imperial hierarchy.|$|E
