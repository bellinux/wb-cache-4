5000|$|The fourteen-year-old {{teenager}} A. A. Morozov, having got a six-years {{education in}} a special school, came in March, 1919 to the Kharkiv engine-building plant.

40|$|Variations in sinkage and cone index are {{of crucial}} {{importance}} when planning fieldwork, and {{for determining the}} trafficability of farm machinery. Many studies have highlighted the link between higher values of these parameters and dramatic decreases in crop yield. Variations in the dry bulk density and cone index of clayey soil in Southern Spain were measured following each of five successive passes over the same land with {{the three types of}} tractor most widely used in the area (tracked, two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive). In addition, sinkage (rut depth) of the running gear was measured using a laser microrelief profile meter. This device, which integrates three sensors, was specifically designed for these experiments, as was an electrical penetrometer to determine the cone index, and both instruments proved reliable and accurate in the field. The main goal {{of this study was to}} design, manufacture and test these new devices. The first pass caused most soil alteration when compared to successive passes for all types of tractor tested and soil conditions prevailing during the tests. (Heavier) four-wheel drive tractors were found to cause greater soil damage (sinkage, cone index and dry bulk density) than two-wheel drive and <b>track</b> <b>tractors.</b> There was no statistically significant difference between the two latter types. The greatest alterations were recorded in the top 10 cm of the soil. The results show that soil compaction should be avoided as much as possible. This can be achieved by ensuring that tractors always travel along the same tracks, especially in the wet season. At present these aspects are not considered by farmers in this are...|$|E

40|$|Compaction is a {{big problem}} in {{agriculture}} today since it has negative effects on both yield and environment. The change in the environment caused by compaction will mean decreased quality of atmosphere, surface- and ground water and soil resources. It is therefore very important to know how different agricultural practices and technical solutions of machinery affect the soil and its functions in order to be ab 1 e to decrease the negative effects from farming. Three field experiments were carried out during the autumn 200 l. Vertical soil displacement and vertical soil stress was measured at 15, 30 and 50 cm depth in three different tractor comparisons; wheel- and <b>tracked</b> <b>tractor,</b> single and dual wheel and pulling and non pulling tractor. For the pull and the track experiments macroporosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity and bulk density were also measured. Calculations of the vertical soil stress were also made. For the single- dual wheel experiment a John Deere 4640 with single wheel and a wheel load of 2500 kg and a Steiger with dual wheels and a wheel load of 2200 kg were used. Both tractors had 60 kPa tyre inflation pressure. The John Deere was also used, together with a cultivator, for the pull experiment. These two experiments were carried out at Staby Säteri, Uppland. The experiment with a tracked vehicle was carried out at Krenkerup Gods, Lolland, Danmark with a rubber <b>tracked</b> <b>tractor</b> weighing 18, 5 tons and a wheel tractor weighing 9, 7 tons. The <b>tracked</b> <b>tractor</b> was balanced before comparing it to the wheeled tractor to get the weight distribution as even as possible. Vertical soil stress and vertical soil displacement right under the wheels of the single and dual wheels did not differ significantly. The soil stress was lowest between the dual wheel at 15 cm depth but ii was evenly distributed under the wheels at 50 cm depth. No {{significant differences were found between}} a non pulling and a pulling tractor regarding vertical soil stress and soil displacement. There was however a tendency that the saturated hydraulic conductivity was lowest after the pass of a pulling tractor. It is possible that a higher pull would have affected the soil more. The soil stress was higher at 15 and 30 cm depth for the wheeled compared to the <b>tracked</b> <b>tractor.</b> There were no significant differences in soil displacement, saturated hydraulic conductivity and bulk density but there was a tendency that the bulk density was higher for the tracked than for the wheeled tractor. The most important conclusions were: (1) The two tyres in a dual wheel arrangement acted as two separate wheels which makes it more relevant to talk about wheelload than axle 1 oad regarding the risk for subsoil compaction. This is a very important result because the recommendation today is to avoid an axle load over 6 tons. (2) Even for a well balanced <b>tracked</b> <b>tractor</b> the maximum soil stress will be considerably higher than the theoretically calculated. In spite of these problems and a higher total weight, a <b>tracked</b> <b>tractor</b> can have a smaller impact on the soil than a wheeled tractor. (3) The model calculations correlated well with the measured values in the subsoil but not in the topsoil!. A better approximation for the ground pressure than the tyre inflation pressure is however' needed since the ground pressure of ten was as much as twice as high as the tyre inflation pressure...|$|R
