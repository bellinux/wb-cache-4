2500|$|Orlando Figes' {{view was}} that Red Terror was implicit, {{not so much in}} Marxism itself, but in the tumultuous {{violence}} of the Russian Revolution. He noted that {{there were a number of}} Bolsheviks, led by Lev Kamenev, Nikolai Bukharin and M. S. Olminsky, who criticized the actions and warned that thanks to [...] "Lenin's violent seizure of power and his rejection of democracy... he Bolsheviks [...] forced to turn increasingly to terror to silence their political critics and subjugate a society they could not control by other means". [...] "The <b>Terror</b> erupted <b>from</b> <b>below.</b> It was an integral element of the social revolution from the start. The Bolsheviks encouraged but did not create this mass terror." ...|$|R
60|$|The next vivid {{thing in}} my memory is {{the view of the}} last barrier Nature had reared between us and the delectable country. It stood like a lion at the gateway, and for some minutes we gazed at it in <b>terror</b> <b>from</b> Powell's Valley <b>below.</b> How many {{thousands}} have looked at it with sinking hearts! How many weaklings has its frown turned back! There seemed to be engraved upon it the dark history of the dark and bloody land beyond. Nothing in this life worth having is won for the asking; and the best is fought for, and bled for, and died for. Written, too, upon that towering wall of white rock, in the handwriting of God Himself, is the history of the indomitable Race to which we belong.|$|R
