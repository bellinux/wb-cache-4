5000|$|Historian Alfred Crosby {{suggested}} in 2003 that both theories are partly correct in a [...] "combination theory". Crosby {{says that the}} bacterium that causes syphilis belongs to the same phylogenetic family as the bacteria that cause yaws and several other diseases. Despite the tradition of assigning the homeland of yaws to sub-Saharan Africa, Crosby notes {{that there is no}} unequivocal evidence of any related disease having been present in pre-Columbian Europe, Africa, or Asia. Crosby writes, [...] "It is not impossible that the organisms causing <b>treponematosis</b> arrived from America in the 1490s ... and evolved into both venereal and non-venereal syphilis and yaws." [...] However, Crosby considers it more likely that a highly contagious ancestral species of the bacteria moved with early human ancestors across the land bridge of the Bering Straits many thousands of years ago without dying out in the original source population. He hypothesizes that [...] "the differing ecological conditions produced different types of <b>treponematosis</b> and, in time, closely related but different diseases." ...|$|E

50|$|Analysis {{of these}} burials {{has shown that}} Fort Ancient peoples were not as healthy as their less agrarian ancestors, a {{byproduct}} of their heavy dependence on maize agriculture. The chronic malnutrition and niacin deficiency caused by the eating of maize as their major food source caused many of the Fort Ancient peoples to have high rates of arthritis, dental diseases, lower life expectancies and a high infant mortality. This chronic malnutrition also made them prone to other infections, such as tuberculosis (which only a few specimens exhibited) and <b>treponematosis</b> (a non venereal form of yaws or syphilis) a disease which many {{were found to have}} been afflicted with.|$|E

40|$|In 2009, {{an archaeological}} {{intervention}} in the Valle da Gafaria (Lagos, Portugal) allowed the excavation of part of a leprosarium and an associated necropolis (15 th- 17 th centuries). The individuals recovered were buried directly in the soil, in positions and orientations discordant to the prevailing Christian rules. The sample {{is made up of}} eleven adult individuals of both sexes. This paper discusses the differential diagnosis of unusual and distinct pathological changes in five of the individuals recovered. The differential diagnosis of the lesions gave rise to several possible pathological conditions, namely, leprosy, <b>treponematosis,</b> brucellosis, slipped femoral capital epiphysis, and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease. Various macroscopic and radiological aspects led us to consider leprosy as the most probable diagnosis in two individuals. <b>Treponematosis</b> and brucellosis were the probable diagnosis in other two individuals, respectively. One individual presented lesions in the right femur compatible with Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease. Historical documents suggest that the poor, mentally disabled, and people suffering from syphilis, tuberculosis, among others, were also housed in leprosaria. Therefore, it is possible that evidence of other conditions is found in human remains uncovered at a leprosarium. The cases under study enrich the scanty osteoarchaeological documentation of paleopathology in Portugal in the Modern Age, namely of leprosy, brucellosis, <b>treponematosis,</b> and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, and they can contribute to reduce the discrepancy between historical and biological evidences of disease...|$|E
40|$|Results of a {{pilot survey}} in the central, {{northern}} region of Surinam indicate that yaws is prevalent (hypoendemic) {{in this part}} of the country.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to {{describe}} and discuss pathological lesions observed in a Roman skeleton (between 2 nd and 3 rd century AD) from the north-east region of the Iberian Peninsula (St Nicasi 18 – 24 site. Gavà, Barcelona), which may be compatible with <b>treponematosis.</b> Most of the skeleton, with the exception of the neurocranium, was recovered. Only the left tibia was affected, whereas the rest of the recovered skeletal remains were unaffected. Macroscopic examination revealed a male individual between 25 and 30 [*]years of age at death with a sabre-shaped left tibia. The proximal half of the diaphysis was pitted and the bone overall enlarged. The surface of the tibia showed occasional vascular impressions where, in some instances, small raised plaques of new bone appeared to bridge over them, specifically in the most affected area of the proximal half of the tibia. No destructive lesions were observed. Radiographic examination and gross inspection at the cross section of the tibia showed encroachment into the medullary cavity of coarse cancellous bone and cancellization of the cortex. The observed lesions indicate that the tibia was affected by a chronic infectious disease. Differential diagnoses were considered, and these included other infectious diseases, fibrous dysplasia, Paget's disease, chronic varicose ulcers affecting bone and trauma, with the conclusion that the disease affecting the tibia could have been <b>treponematosis.</b> This could be significant in the history of the treponematoses being one of the oldest examples of <b>treponematosis</b> in pre-Columbian Europe...|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} five new cases of possible <b>treponematosis</b> in early medieval Denmark. A total of 1018 skeletons from Danish and present day German cemeteries have been examined, and five candidates of pre-Columbian individuals have been selected from three Danish burial sites on Funen, Jutland and Zealand. The five individuals with a possible infection with treponematoses have been analysed anthropological and chemically.|$|E
30|$|Considering {{the climate}} and {{geography}} at the sites, venereal syphilis might be the treponemal disease causing the pathologies on the skeletal remains. However, the historical background, the bone lesions and their prevalence point {{to the presence of}} a less aggressive, maybe non-venereal, form of <b>treponematosis.</b> Consequently, the hypothesis that pre-Columbian venereal syphilis existed among the analysed skeletal material is rejected with the help of various archaeometric analyses.|$|E

Moreover, one of the patients had pathological auditory brain stem responses, which indicate brain stem dysfunction. Another patient had signs of Menière's syndrome in one ear...|$|E
40|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of Jamaica are now generally {{referred to as}} Taínos. It is likely that they arrived in the island after about 650 AD and were extinct {{by the end of}} the 16 th century. In 1968, during the exploration of a small cave in Bull Savannah, St. Elizabeth parish, Dr. James Lee found two skulls, teeth, bones, and pottery. The aim of this work is to interpret in a biocultural perspective the one cranium with pathological lesions, such as caries sicca. This adult individual had an artificially modified cranium, a cultural practice common among Taínos, which was studied macroscopically and by radiological and computerized tomography. The radiocarbon dates, obtained by AMS, point to the 10 th- 11 th centuries AD and the stable isotopes analysis revealed either the ingestion of a mixed C 3 /C 4 plant diet or an extensive intake of marine resources, the former being more likely. This is the first cranium to be found in Jamaica with evidence of Pre-Columbian <b>treponematosis,</b> most probably syphilis, which has also been demonstrated in a few cases elsewhere in the Caribbean region. This finding agrees with the ethnohistorical narrative, according to which syphilis existed among the native population, who used plant extracts to treat the disease. This paper contributes to our knowledge about the Taínos and the history of <b>treponematosis</b> in the Americas...|$|E
40|$|Descriptive {{dermatology}} in past generations was de-tailed, differentiating, {{and sometimes}} frankly imaginative. It tended to separate differing clinical manifestations which were subsequently {{found to have}} a common causation and to produce confusion of terminology even among nationals speaking their mother tongue; on the international plane confusion became worse confounded. Yaws, the <b>treponematosis</b> with a special predilection for skin and bone, is a case in point. The disadvantages arising from a confused nomenclature became specially signifi-cant in 1949 when the availability of long-acting penicillin preparations opened the way for national yaws-control campaigns in the major endemic areas of the world. In these mass campaigns agreed terminology is essential for teaching the para-medical personnel who will carry ou...|$|E
40|$|Of 202 captive hares studied, many {{of which}} had lesions on their {{external}} genital organs or testicular atrophy or both, 27 % had positive serological tests for syphilis although dark-field examination of extracts of atrophic testes was negative. A total of 12 hares that were nonreactive for the serological test for syphilis was inoculated with Treponema pallidum, 9 intratesticularly and 3 intradermally. Six of the animals inoculated intratesticularly exhibited orchitis after 7 days with an associated accumulation of treponemes. No chancres developed in the intracutaneously inoculated animals during a 27 -day period of observation. These results provide additional {{evidence to support the}} contention that endemic <b>treponematosis</b> occurs in wild hares and suggest that hares are moderately resistant to experimental infection with T. pallidum...|$|E
40|$|Bone {{and dental}} lesions {{characteristic}} of treponemal infection {{have been reported}} in the skeletal remains of indigenous peoples from a number of archaeological sites on the Northwest Coast. Associated radiocarbon dates and material culture indicate that some cases are over 3000 years old. The evidence identified to date includes diagnostic lesions indicative of the venereal treponemal syndrome, venereal syphilis. This dissertation reviews the previously reported evidence and introduces new possible cases of <b>treponematosis</b> from recent archaeological findings in my work as a consulting bioarchaeologist, synthesizing these data to illuminate patterns of prevalence and distribution of treponemal skeletal lesions in time and space to evaluate the treponemal syndrome obtained on the Northwest Coast. A novel system of diagnosing cases of treponemal infection by the composite scores of different lesion types to produce a rigorous and repeatable diagnostic index (Treponemal Index) is introduced and applied to 52 cases identified as possible <b>treponematosis</b> from archaeological populations. In addition to caries sicca and gummatous osteomyelitis, evidence of congenital syphilis, aortitis and neuroarthropathy are found, confirming that a venereal treponemal syndrome was present in archaeological populations of the Strait of Georgia region. The prevalence of cases peaks in the Middle Period, and may have contributed to the decline observed in the Late Period in the archaeological record of the Strait of Georgia through the impact on fertility from congenital infection. Longstanding debates about the nature and origin of venereal syphilis and the other human treponemes continue into the 21 st century. However, since the subsuming of endemic syphilis and yaws as subspecies of Treponema pallidum, the Unitarian Hypothesis has by definition been confirmed. This dissertation embraces this perspective. The data generated here are subsequently employed to test the predictions and principles of the Unitarian model against the Northwest Coast archaeological and ethnographic record...|$|E
40|$|In bioarchaeology, {{skeletal}} {{biology and}} paleopathology, periosteal reaction has been variably {{considered as a}} non-specific sign of trauma and alternatively as having potentially diagnostic implications. Examination of sixth millennium before present Texas cemeteries falsifies the non-specific trauma hypothesis, while examination of a second millennium before present site reveals a new (at least to Texas) population phenomenon. In contrast to isolated bumps and osteomyelitis, the study of periosteal reaction in early Texas {{is the study of}} “virgins, ” indi-viduals spared the phenomenon that cause such bone alteration. It is only in the second millennium before pre-sent that periosteal reaction becomes widespread, both in population penetrance and in extent of skeleton af-fected.

40|$|A {{total of}} 2515 people {{attending}} a large military hospital in Saudi Arabia was studied clinically, serologically, and (when appropriate) radiologically {{for evidence of}} <b>treponematosis.</b> The indications are that non-venereal endemic syphilis (bejel) is prevalent among the nomadic communities living in rural areas. In contrast, venereal syphilis is much less common, and is found almost exclusively in urban populations. Some of the high risk regions for bejel have been identified, and many people from these locations complained of persistent pain in the legs, which was often associated with radiological evidence of osteoperiostitis of the long bones. Bejel also seems to have become clinically "attenuated" within the last 30 years, {{with the majority of}} seroreactors having latent disease. A hypothesis suggesting a reason for this change is put forward, and ways of controlling the infection are outlined...|$|E
40|$|A human {{burial of}} late Holocene age was {{recently}} excavated from inland northwest Queensland and studied prior to reburial by the Indigenous community.

Similar burial techniques have been described in the region 2 ̆ 7 s ethnographic literature, and this site represents the first known archaeological example. Ascertaining a firm date for the burial is problematic owing {{to the nature of}} the radiocarbon calibration curve in recent centuries. A detailed analysis of the bones indicated the individual to be an adult female, most likely of middle age. There are some significant pathological lesions present that are indicative of <b>treponematosis.</b> The alleographic and cultural context of the burial leads us to suggest the most likely diagnosis is treponarid...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of paleopathology is to clarify the role of disease {{in the evolution of}} human groups. The recovery of DNA and immunoglobulins from archeological human skeletal tissue offers a method for enhancing and expanding our knowledge about the presence and significance of disease in past human populations. DNA also might reveal the presence of genetic disease. Immunoglobulins recovered from archeological bone indicate some of the diseases to which an individual was exposed during life. This information also provides supporting evidence for anatomical observations of skeletal disease. This is illustrated by the identification of treponemal antibody in an archeological skeleton that has gross lesions suggestive of <b>treponematosis.</b> Similar biochemical methods could be applied to other research problems to clarify the presence of various syndromes of the inflammatory erosive arthropathies, such as rheumatoid arthritis, in New World archeological populations. Some of these syndromes are associated with DNA sequences and specific proteins that are recoverable from archeological skeletal tissue...|$|E
40|$|Treponema paraluiscuniculi, the {{etiologic}} agent of rabbit venereal syphilis, is morphologically indistinguishable from Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum (T. pallidum), the human syphilis treponeme, and induces similar immune responses and histopathologic {{changes in the}} infected host. Because of their high degree of relatedness, comparative studies are likely to identify genetic determinants that contribute to pathogenesis or virulence in human syphilis. The tpr (Treponema pallidum repeat) genes are believed to code for potential virulence factors. In this study, we identified 10 tpr homologs in Treponema paraluiscuniculi Cuniculi A strain and determined their sequence architecture. Half of this group of paralogous genes were predicted to be nonfunctional due {{to the presence of}} frameshifts and premature stop codons. Furthermore, the immune response against the T. paraluiscuniculi Tpr homologs in long-term-infected rabbits was studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and lymphocyte proliferation assay, showing that TprK is the only target of the antibody and T-cell responses during experimental infection and emphasizing the importance of this putative virulence factor in venereal <b>treponematosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{tests the}} hypothesis that urbanization in a medieval Polish population caused the general quality of life to decline. Furthermore, it will test {{the hypothesis that}} these consequences of urbanization occurred gradually and were not severe. These hypotheses are tested by documentation of stress indicators, specific infectious diseases, dietary indicators, and traumatic injuries. As a corollary, I document workload {{as an indicator of}} lifestyle. To test these hypotheses, three medieval Polish skeletal samples are used, representing the three temporal periods of interest: pre-urbanization (A. D. 950 - 1025), early urbanization (A. D. 1025 - 1100), and late urbanization (A. D. 1100 - 1250). The prevalence of stress indicators (porotic hyperostosis, cribra orbitalia, enamel hypoplasias, and periostitis) and specific infectious diseases (leprosy, <b>treponematosis,</b> and tuberculosis) are compared among the three temporal groups to determine whether health declined. In addition, the average adult stature is temporally compared, as stature reflects overall health. The prevalence, pattern and severity of DJD are also compared among th...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{neglected}} disease with a nearly forgotten name {{is making a}} comeback following a global control programme that almost eradicated it {{more than forty years}} ago. Until the 1970 s the prevalence of non-venereal <b>treponematosis,</b> including yaws, was greatly reduced after worldwide mass treatment. In 2005, cases were again reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A deterministic model is formulated to investigate the impact of poverty on yaws eradication. Threshold parameters are determined and stabilities analysed. The reproductive number was also used {{to assess the impact of}} birth rate in resource-constrained families on the dynamics of yaws. The model was shown to be globally stable whenever the associated reproductive number is less than a unity. Using the Lyapunov function it was proved that whenever the associated reproductive number is greater than a unity an endemic equilibrium exists and is globally asymptotically stable. Results from this theoretical study suggests that if the population of children in the community is dominated by those from resource-constrained families, then yaws eradication will remain difficulty to attain. Thus, more needs to be done in addressing issues such as high fertility rate, overcrowding, poor sanitation, etc. and poverty in general so that yaws epidemic which was successfully controlled several decades ago will cease to reemerge and can easily be eradicated...|$|E
40|$|Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA) is a bone {{pathology}} {{that can}} be associated with a number of focal or systemic diseases, particularly those affecting the respiratory system. HOA is characterized by proliferative periostosis of the long bones, especially in their distal and periarticular regions. This report presents a probable case of HOA in the skeleton of an elderly Portuguese male from Évora, Portugal, who died in 1970. The skeleton was evaluated by morphological, radiological, and histological methods. We found bilateral periosteal proliferation of the tubular bones, remodeling of the phalanges of the feet, and new bone formation on rib visceral surfaces. Bone alterations are more severe on the left tibia and fibula, where lesions display a ‘tree bark’ appearance, leading to severe thickening of the diaphysis. Microscopically, we observed deposition of porous woven bone. Our evaluation also considers a differential diagnosis of the lesions, which includes melorheostosis, hypervitaminosis A, fluorosis, thyroid acropachy, tuberculosis, and <b>treponematosis.</b> AcknowledgmentsThis chapter is funded by FEDER Funds through the Opera-tional Programme for Competitiveness Factors – COMPETE andNational Funds through FCT – Foundation for Science and Tech-nology under the Strategic Projects PEst-C/AGR/UI 0115 / 2011,PEst-OE/AGR/UI 0115 / 2014 and through the Programa OperacionalRegional do Alentejo (InAlentejo) Operation ALENT- 07 - 0262 -FEDER- 001871 /Laboratório de Biotecnologia Aplicada e Tecnolo-gias Agro-Ambientais.

40|$|A close {{relationship}} between the four human treponematoses is suggested by their clinical and epidemiological characteristics and by such limited knowledge of the treponemes as there is at present. No treponeme of this group (except for that of the rabbit) is known other than in man, but the human treponemes probably arose long ago from an animal infection. The long period of infectiousness of pinta suggests {{that it may have}} been the earliest human <b>treponematosis.</b> It may have been spread throughout the world by about 15 000 B. C., being subsequently isolated in the Americas when the Bering Strait was flooded. About 10 000 B. C. in the Afro-Asian land mass environmental conditions might have favoured treponeme mutants leading to yaws; from these, about 7000 B. C., endemic syphilis perhaps developed, to give rise to venereal syphilis about 3000 B. C. in south-west Asia as big cities developed there. Towards the end of the fifteenth century A. D. a further mutation may have resulted in a more severe venereal syphilis in Europe which, with European exploration and geographical expansion, was subsequently carried throughout the then treponemally uncommitted world. These suggestions find some tentative support in climatic changes which might have influenced the selection of those treponemes which still survive in humid or arid climates. Venereal transmission would presumably remove the treponeme from the direct influence of climate. The author makes a plea for further investigation of many aspects of this subject while this is still possible...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the osteological {{analysis of a}} young adult exhumed from the cemetery associated to Igreja do Carmo, Lisbon, Portugal, during the second archaeological intervention in 2010 / 2011. Although the cemetery had been used between {{the beginning of the}} 15 th century and 1755 A. D., the archaeological context of the burial allows us to gauge its dating between the 17 th and the 18 th centuries. The skeleton is distinguished by a cranial morphology suggestive of an African origin and intentional dental modifications. These consist of the removal of both incisal angles of the upper incisors, which corresponds to a practice related to culture, commonly made in sub-Saharan Africa since prehistoric times to the present. A periapical lesion was associated to the maxillary right central incisor that was apparently healthy but modified. The left clavicle showed bone remodelling along the shaft. Five ribs displayed new bone deposition, and the sternal end of the first left rib was deformed and destroyed. The differential diagnosis of the lesions gave rise to several possible pathological conditions, namely, <b>treponematosis</b> and chronic respiratory disease, particularly tuberculosis. Various macroscopic aspects and the geographical context lead us to consider venereal syphilis as the most probable diagnose. Considering that, during the 16 th century, Lisbon has become a fundamental part of the intercontinental maritime routes {{it is not surprising that}} African people were buried in the cemeteries of Lisbon, allowing us to learn more about their lives and deaths...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{evaluated}} {{the prevalence of}} skin lesions in a gorilla population in the Republic of Congo. The observed lesions were typical of yaws, a <b>treponematosis</b> described in gorillas and humans living in tropical regions. Among the 377 gorillas identified, 17 % presented skin lesions, mainly on their faces. The worst cases presented physical handicaps because of the deep lesions. As in humans, lesions break out when individuals are young. Lesions were more prevalent among males than females above 8 years old. This sex-bias prevalence could result from the behavioral characteristics of males through a greater exposure to wounds. Lesions were also more prevalent in unmated adult males (either solitaries or those living in nonbreeding groups) than in males leading breeding groups. In {{the case of the}} latter, nonaffected and affected leading males had a similar number of infants and juveniles. Still, none of the leading males ever presented serious handicaps because of the skin lesions. This suggests that adult females could favor males without lesions. Finally, lesions were more prevalent among immature animals in nonbreeding groups than in breeding groups, suggesting that either young animals with lesions disperse earlier from their natal groups, or that the disease spreads faster in nonbreeding groups. Our results provide some insights into the spread of a disease in a wild population. Further studies are required to determine if the vigor of males affects the development of the disease and if affected individuals experience social discrimination inducing a negative impact on population dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The endemic <b>treponematosis</b> yaws {{remains a}} {{significant}} cause of morbidity in many tropical countries, despite mass treatment campaigns to eradicate it. An outbreak of yaws in Marup village on Karkar Island, Papua New Guinea in 1988 {{provided an opportunity}} to monitor the outcome of treatment with penicillin over an extended period. Thirty-nine children with clinical yaws (6 % of 632 examined) were monitored clinically and serologically, {{for nearly two years}} after mass treatment of all villagers with the World Health Organization recommended dosages of benzathine penicillin. Lesions resolved within one month of treatment in all but four (10 %) children, three of whom were initially successfully retreated. Before treatment, the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test result was reactive in 67 % of the children and treponema-specific IgM antibody test results were reactive in 41 %. Within six months of treatment, of those reactive, the VDRL titer decreased significantly in 25 (96 %) of 26 and IgM antibody test results became negative in 13 (81 %) of 16 children. However, by the end of follow-up, 11 (28 %) of the 39 children had developed clinical and/or serologic evidence of relapse. In these children, response to further treatment was slow and, in three, evidence of active infection persisted or recurred, despite repeated courses. Exog-enous reinfection was unlikely in this isolated community, in which the occurrence of yaws was closely monitored after universal treatment. Treatment failure was most likely to have been due to reduced susceptibility to penicillin of Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue...|$|E

The aim of this mission was to study {{individuals}} not having been tested before by any previous french or danish expedition (Gessain 1935, Skeller 1950, Tingsgaard 1962). Before {{the departure of the}} mission for Ammassalik in 1969 a list of these individuals, never serologica'lly determined, has been established by the C. R. A.; blood samples have been obtained from 130 individuals. This sample was only made to complete previous work; it is too small to allow any estimation of gene frequencies or any other form of statistic or genetic analysis. Results are given in the rough — phenotypes counting — especially because the necessity of completing an already very important sample made us collect an heterogeneous group of individuals some of which were relatives and the others were not. Definitely we must not look for another explanation to such facts as the high frequency of phenotype AB in our results. Results. Table I gives results concerning red cells typing. We must add that the 130 individuals were all Rhesus positive, Kell negative, vw negative and i positive; no red cells antigènes have been found in the Lewis system. Table II gives results concerning Gm and Inv. systems. The GmB factor corresponds to Gm 25 (described by Blanc et al.) of the international nomenclature. Table III gives results concerning haptoglobins. Hematimetric and cytoche- mical studies have been made on some samples. Hemoglobins have been found all normal.

40|$|Background: The {{neglected}} tropical {{diseases are}} {{a group of}} 13 infections that affect more than one billion people worldwide, especially {{those who live in}} extreme poverty. Aim: This study was conducted to determine community knowledge of these neglected tropical diseases (NTD) in Cameroon. Materials and Methods: A random sampling method was used to administer questionnaires to 3345 adults. Results: 2566 (76. 7 %) of people approached responded to the questionnaire. This comprised 1313 (51. 2 %) females and 1253 (48. 8 %) males. There was a significant level of association between the opinion of the respondents and their region of residence (P< 0. 05). Globally the percentage of persons with good knowledge of one of the neglected tropical diseases was low (ranging from 23. 1 % to 80. 9 %). Diseases for which the population had the highest percentages of knowledge were leprosy (80. 9 %), soil-transmitted helminth infections (75. 3 %), lymphatic filariosis (70. 3 %), onchocerciasis (66. 2 %) and human African trypanosomiasis (57. 8 %). Diseases for which people had the least percentages of knowledge were leishmaniosis (18. 0 %), dracunculiasis (23. 1 %), buruli ulcer (23. 8 %), trachoma (38. 2 %), endemic <b>treponematosis</b> (41. 5 %) and schistosomiasis (49. 1 %). Populations living in urban areas had a greater knowledge of the neglected tropical diseases than those living in rural and peri-urban areas (P< 0. 05) and males exhibited a greater knowledge than females (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: There was low community knowledge pattern of neglected tropical diseases, mostly among the female populations and people living in rural areas. We advocate mass media health education to be adopted as one of the strategies for the national control policy of NTDs...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{characterize}} the health status {{of the population in}} early Lund. This is pursued by an osteological analysis of 3. 305 individuals fron three time periods: c. 990 - 1100, c. 1100 - 1300 and c. 1300 - 1536. The individuals derives from cemeteries connected to four neighbouring churches, where one is the sucessor of the other (Trinitatis). One cemetery (Kattesund) is by and large completely excavated. This represents a situation not common to other excavations of Medieval cemeteries in Scandinavia. The following osteological parameters were studied: age, sex, stature, oral health, joint diseases, infections and trauma. The age distribution is {{more or less the same}} between the time periods. There is a tendency of a higher proportion of children found during the later periods. There is no significan difference with respect to stature between time periods. Further, no difference in stature could be substantiated with respect to the position of the graves, a dimension of the material that is known to correlate with socio-economic position of the deceased. Oral health detoriated during the last time period. The frequency of joint diseases, i. e. osteoarthritis did not change over time. Leprosy represents the most common form of specific infection beween 990 - 1100. At this time there were no separate leprosy hospital in Lund, and the lepers were buried in the periphery of the common cemeteries. <b>Treponematosis</b> could be identified only during the time period 1300 - 1536, and this in connection with the last buried individuals. Unspecific infections could be found with respect to all time periods. Periostitis was more common among the males during the earliest time period. Osteomyelitis, however, increased over time, being more common among the males. The frequency of traumatic lesions increased over time with regard to the male population of Lund, not the females. As there is no apparent covariation with regard to the osteological parameters, there is no basis for the conclusion that the health changes chronologically. Neither do we substantiate a detoriation nor an improvment from 990 to 1536 with regard to skeletal health. However, the proportion of subadults increases as we approach the later period 100 - 1536. This result is interpreted as an increased load of infectious diseases...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to conduct a bioarchaeological analysis of the adaptation of Archaic Period hunter-gatherers living on the inland portion of the West Gulf Coastal Plain of Texas. This study, conducted on human skeletal remains recovered from Morhiss and Ernest Witte, provides the first large-scale study of biological adaptation of Archaic Period hunter-gatherers from the region. Over 360 individuals were analyzed in terms of age, sex, body size, and health, to assess the ability of these prehistoric peoples to adapt to their environment. Results of the demographic portion of this analysis suggest that differential selective pressures were not acting on adults from Morhiss or Ernest Witte. Children represented less than 20 percent of the sample, but this most likely reflects the poor skeletal preservation along the inland portion of the coast, rather than the survival of {{a large proportion of}} children to adulthood. A metric analysis of body size documented a large degree of adult sexual dimorphism, indicative of a healthy population. Skeletal evidence for infectious disorders was low, suggesting a population of relatively healthy people, in spite of the presence of endemic <b>treponematosis.</b> Trauma was limited primarily to bones of the hands and feet, indicating that trauma associated with accidents was more prevalent than trauma associated with violent behavior. Degenerative joint disease was the most commonly observed skeletal lesion, but the degree of osteoarthritis observed on the Archaic coastal samples was similar to other coastal samples from North America. Rates of osteoarthritis were highest in the hands, which when combined with high trauma rates in the hands, would have had a negative impact on quality of life. Evidence for anemia was low, which is consistent with the frequency expected for nomadic hunter-gatherer groups. Neoplasms and congenital skeletal disorders were not common. Data from numerous types of skeletal disorders, combined with information obtained from demography and body size analyses, indicate that these populations along the inland portion of the coastal plain of Texas during the Archaic Period were well-adapted to their environment. This finding is consistent with archaeological evidence from the same region and time period...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Hemotypology of Scoresbysund (east Greenland.) INTRODUCTION. Founded in 1925 by 70 {{immigrants}} from Ammassalik, Scoresbysund {{is the most}} northern greenlandic establishment of {{the east coast of}} Greenland. Eight people from west Greenland joined this east greenlandic community by several intermarriages. Within forty five years this population has known an uncommon demographical expansion due mostly to the excess of births on deaths. The population of this community was in 1970 of 420 people, all coming either from the flounders or from some forty immigrants, also from Ammassalik, and arrived later. The age structure is that of a particularly young population; the 246 blood samples which analyses are described below concern almost the entire population over 12 years. A detailed demographical and socio-economical study of this population has been made by J. Robert (1) (2) and any interested reader can refer to it. ERYTHROCYTE BLOOD GROUPS Phenotypical frequencies are given in table I. When the concordance of these distributions with our genetic hypotheses and Hardy-Weinberg law has been ascertained, we calculated the gene frequencies in spite of the small sample size (246 people). Such a small sample comes from the population size since we sampled nearly every one between our age limits. 1) ABO system (table I) : as in other eskimo populations phenotype A 2 was not found. В allele is very rare, probably according to a founder effect. Phenotype frequencies allow the computation of gene frequencies given in table I. 2) Rhesus system (table II) : all the individuals are Rhesus positive. Chromosome r seems inexistant and the observed phenotypes may be explained by the presence of four chromosomes: Rb R 2, Ro, Rz- The first one is, by far, the most frequent and the last one is only encountered in some hétérozygotes and may come from West Greelandic immigrants. If we consider separately the antigenic systems Cc and Ее we realize that the lack of concordance between the computed and observed phenotypic distributions comes from a very high lack of homozygotes ЕЕ and ее. This may come from a bad recognition of the E antigene by the used serum. So we are led to consider a low reactivity of ťhe E antigènes among at least a part of their carriers. The same has been observed among Chipaya indians for С antigène (3). 3) MNSs system (table III), curiously, is in equilibrium for the ordy Ss locus and in strong desequilibrium if we consider the MN locus alone or both loci. This comes from an important excess of MN heterozygotes and from the almost absence of NN homozygotes. It will be interesting to determine whether it comes by chance, which is possible in such a small population, or if other hypotheses have to be considered as elsewhere (4) (5) (6). 4) P, jka and Duffy systems (table IV) are polymorphic. Fya — individuals are very rare and don't allow any computation of gene frequency; the results concerning the two other systems are only approximations because the distribution cannot be tested and the sample is small. 5) The whole of the 246 tested individuals was Kell negative, vb and i positive. 6) No a or b Lewis antigène was found at the red cells level. negative SERIC GROUPS Two individuals of partly west greenlandic origin show the 1, 2, 17, 21 phenotype in the Gm system. Another one is 3, 5, 10, 11, 14, 25, owing to a danish ancestor. The results for the 243 other samples (Gm and Inv system) are given in table II. The distribution of the Gm polymorphism may be explained by three alleles — Gm Ь 1 '' 21 the most common _ Gml, 10, 11, 17, 25 _ Gm 1, 3, 5, 10, 11, 14, 25 (or Gm 1, 3, 5, 10, 11, 14, 17, 25) Haplotype frequencies are given by table II. The fit is good. OTHER SYSTEMS AND VARIOUS RESULTS 1) Haptoglobins: alleles 1 and 2 are present with comparable frequencies (Table III). 2) Alkalin phosphatase: 60 % of the samples show phenotype 1 (Table III). 3) Other results: — hemoglobins are normal, as expected — blood proteins proportions (measured by electrophoresis) lie in the range of usual variation in european populations — no <b>treponematosis</b> was found. CONCLUSION. This work {{is the first step in}} detailed genetic analysis of a population showing an uncommon history. The genealogical data obtained by J. Robert and the studies undertaken in Ammassalik by the danish scientists and medical doctors as well as by the french team led by R. Gessain (7) will allow us to conclude about some hypotheses appeared in this work. The founder effect concerning the ABO system is almost certain as well as the particular properties of the E antigène of certain individuals. On the contrary, the distribution of the MN system is worth of a particular attention, in order to choose between the hypothesis of an effect of chance and small numbers (apparently bigger than what is expected) and, on the other hand, a selective hypothesis comparable to those made about other populations (some of which are mongoloid) but not yet confirmed.

40|$|Every year, through mass drug {{administration}} (MDA), {{hundreds of millions}} of the world’s poorest people receive a single annual dose of one or more drugs to eliminate certain parasitic worm or bacterial infections. Some of these infections, mostly prevalent in tropical areas, have traditionally been neglected from the public health and research point of view. These conditions, collectively known as the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), still cause, at the cusp of the second decade of the 21 st century, a significant amount of morbidity and mortality. The existing control measures for NTD have an enormous potential, although there are still some challenges that require further investigation. For some diseases, alternative strategies may be needed, including longer duration of MDA programmes or modified drug regimens. For other diseases, such as yaws, the work must start almost from scratch, since little has been achieved in terms of control of this disease in the past 50 years. Although eight NTDs affect the region, two diseases pose a major public health problem in the South Pacific Islands, namely yaws and lymphatic filariasis and are the basis for his thesis. These two infections were selected for a number of reasons. First, they affect the South Pacific region disproportionately. Secondly, little research has been conducted in the past years. And third, but more importantly, several epidemiological, technological and historical factors make these two diseases amenable to elimination. Safe and effective tools and interventions to achieve these targets are available and concerted efforts to scale them up are likely to lead to success. Yaws {{is one of the most}} neglected of the NTDs. Yaws was one of the first diseases to be targeted for eradication on a global scale, efforts which almost led to the disease disappearance as a result of a massive treatment program started in the 1950 s. After the successful eradication campaigns the primary health care systems were supposed to give the last push towards eradication of yaws. However a combination of various factors including poor political commitment and limited funding resulted in a progressive abandonment of efforts and the resurgence of the disease. Every new case of yaws was the disappointing confirmation that the public health world had missed a great opportunity. Today yaws has resurged in many tropical areas and presents new challenges including its unknown epidemiological situation, the attenuated clinical forms of the disease, a poor awareness and knowledge among health care workers, the lack of knowledge about the effectiveness of classic treatment with penicillin and, an obvious need for research into simplified administration schemes or new antibiotic treatments, particularly oral ones. There is an enormous knowledge gap regarding current reliable epidemiological information about the disease. Certainly we know little about the burden in the three Melanesian countries where the disease is highly endemic, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and, Vanuatu. In Solomon Islands and Vanuatu there are indications that Yaws is widespread and prevalent, but we know that the diagnosis is unreliable. This takes us to the next point, what does a diagnosis of yaws mean? Overall the natural history of the disease in this era, where it is often subject to inadequate antibiotic pressure, is very unclear. Some authors have suggested that yaws appears to be attenuated in both Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. They state that bone involvement in yaws is now rare and implies that yaws is a mild disease not requiring efforts for elimination. However, the first paper of this thesis describes the epidemiology of yaws in Lihir Island (Papua New Guinea, PNG) and shows a high rate of classical primary ulcers (almost 60 %) and significant bone and periosteal involvement (more than 15 %), suggesting that “attenuation” is not an important issue. When we look at the diagnostic criteria for yaws, signs and symptoms alone are still used often in many areas to diagnose the disease. This reliance on clinical findings was the result of the difficulty of performing serological tests in remote areas. Today, available rapid serological tests are simple, rapid, inexpensive and useful for guiding confirmation of cases, making them adequate tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease. The clinical diagnosis of yaws is complicated because its clinical manifestations may be unspecific. Thus, it is possible that a significant proportion of yaws cases may in fact have been falsely diagnosed. We show, in the first article, that in our experience only 60 % of the cases with a clinical suspicion of yaws were finally confirmed by serologic tests. Therefore, a proper diagnosis of yaws requires the interpretation of clinical findings with reference to laboratory results and the epidemiologic history of the patient. Serological testing in yaws is not only important for diagnostic accuracy, but also is very helpful in defining the disease’s evolution and eventual cure after treatment. Rapid plasma regain (RPR) titres should decline within 6 - 12 months, becoming negative in less than 2 years. The second article of this thesis combines a clinical and serological approach to assess the response after treatment with benzathine benzylpenicillin, and it identifies an overall 20 % treatment failure. This could be related to resistance to the antimicrobial drug used or to re-infection caused. The distinction between re-infection and true resistance to antibiotic treatment is difficult to make but these failures are worrisome. This article also proposes a multivariate model performed to identify independent determinants of failure that affected the outcome after treatment. The risk for reinfection caused by repeated contact with infected children seems to be a pivotal predictor of failure. Low baseline titters (< 1 : 32) of RPR are also an important and independent predictor of failure, possibly as a result of the greater difficulty in resolving chronic infections which are usually accompanied by low titters. With yaws re-emerging, the development of new strategies against this infection aimed at simplifying its treatment and potentially re-focussing strategies towards its eradication seems essential. Injectable penicillin is still effective but management with an oral drug that can be easily administered on a large scale should be the preferred method for treatment. To date, there had been no studies that directly compared the efficacy of penicillin with any of the potentially alternative agents shown to work in the treatment of the non-venereal treponematoses. The fourth paper in this thesis has shown that a single-dose of oral azithromycin is non-inferior to benzathine benzylpenicillin for the treatment of yaws in children in PNG. In an open-label randomised trial, at 6 -month follow-up, 96 % of patients treated with azithromycin were cured, as were 93 % in the benzathine benzylpenicillin group. The prospects of eliminating and eventually eradicating yaws may now be enhanced by the use of a single-dose of oral azithromycin in mass {{drug administration}} campaigns. Community based mass administration of azithromycin has been widely used in many locations for the control of trachoma, which, like yaws, is a disease of poor rural communities in developing countries, and has been used in a more limited way to control granuloma inguinale and outbreaks of venereal syphilis. Elimination of yaws and lymphatic filariasis in the South-Pacific Islands is now considered biologically feasible and programmatically attainable. The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) has expanded quickly to reach the target of elimination by 2020. On the other hand the strategy to eliminate yaws is again at the centre of discussions and given that infected humans are the only source of disease, its eradication could be achieved within a very relatively short time. The fifth article of the thesis comprehensively reviews antimicrobial treatments and elimination strategies against yaws. In order to control yaws and push it towards elimination, we propose to move away from penicillin to azithromycin and use mass treatment campaigns of the entire population in endemic communities irrespective of the prevalence. Also, to make sure all cases are tracked down and treated, strict follow-up measures and selective mass treatment will be required until zero case prevalence is reached. Importantly, we suggest testing the principle of interrupting transmission in pilot implementation studies, including prevalence surveys to assess the impact of the intervention and macrolide resistance monitoring which in our opinion will be essential evaluation tools to guide us towards a sustainable elimination. Lymphatic filariasis (LF), caused by the mosquito-borne nematode Wuchereria Bancrofti, is a major public-health problem in the Melanesian countries. Annual MDA over five years is currently the WHO’s recommended strategy to eliminate lymphatic filariasis. This approach aims to suppress microfilaraemia in infected individuals and bring the infection below a threshold that leads to interruption of transmission. However theoretical work and clinical field experience has highlighted how the ecological diversity between different endemic regions can result in elimination thresholds that vary between local communities. This means that the duration required might be different for different areas. Other variables have also been previously identified as potentially having an influence on the outcome of the program, including baseline prevalence of infection, vector density or the treatment coverage. The last article of this thesis provides data about the impact of a five-year filariasis control program in Papua New Guinea. The findings reported support this strategy for areas with low-to-moderate rates of transmission in regions where anopheline mosquitoes transmit this infectious disease. Additional measures or longer periods of treatment may be necessary in areas with a high rate of transmission. The experience acquired on Lihir Island in MDA programs during the campaigns for the elimination of filariasis, will be very valuable when implementing a pilot strategy for yaws control. Also, in the near future it might be important to link yaws mass treatment with other mass programmes to increase efficiency. The plan for elimination of lymphatic filariasis in PNG was approved as a pilot project in 2005 but the program still needs to be extended to the total of 20 provinces in the country where filariasis is endemic. In this context, an integrated approach to NTD control could represent an important global public health solution in PNG and other South Pacific Islands. Little has been achieved in the past decade in NTDs. We are now in a good position to translate into policies the results of our research projects. A new elimination policy for yaws around the azithromycin pillar has been sketched a WHO consultation meeting held in Morges, Switzerland last March. In the intentions of the organization, a last global mass campaign to tackle yaws should permit to reach zero cases in 2017, and the subsequent certification of worldwide interruption of transmission by 2020. Cada año, a través de la administración masiva de medicamentos (MDA), cientos de millones de personas, las más pobres del mundo, reciben una dosis única de uno o más medicamentos para eliminar ciertas infecciones, parasitarias o bacterianas. Algunas de estas infecciones, frecuentes sobre todo en las zonas tropicales, han sido tradicionalmente desatendidas desde el punto de vista de salud pública e investigación. Estas enfermedades, conocidas comúnmente como las enfermedades tropicales desatendidas (ETD), aún causan, en el inicio de la segunda década del siglo 21, una cantidad significativa de morbilidad y mortalidad. Las medidas de control actuales para ETDs tienen un enorme potencial, pero todavía existen algunas cuestiones que requieren investigación. Para algunas de estas infecciones, son necesarias estrategias alternativas, incluyendo una mayor duración de los programas de MDA o regímenes modificados de medicamentos. Para otras enfermedades, como la enfermedad de pián, el trabajo debe comenzar casi desde cero, ya que poco se ha logrado, en términos de control de esta enfermedad, en los últimos 50 años. Aunque ocho ETDs afectan a la región, dos enfermedades constituyen un problema importante de salud pública en las Islas del Pacífico Sur, a saber: el pián y la filariasis linfática y son la base de esta tesis. Estas dos infecciones fueron elegidas por muchas razones. En primer lugar, afectan a la región del Pacífico Sur de forma desproporcionada. En segundo lugar, pocas investigaciones se han llevado a cabo en los últimos años. Y en tercer lugar, pero lo más importante, varios factores epidemiológicos, tecnológicos e históricos hacen que estas dos enfermedades sean susceptibles de eliminación. Existen armas terapéuticas seguras y eficaces para lograr este objetivo, y esfuerzos coordinados para ejecutar los programas de control pueden conducir al éxito. El pián es una de las más olvidadas de las ETDs. Ésta fue una de las primeras enfermedades en ser objetivo de erradicación a escala global. Los esfuerzos de un programa de tratamiento masivo, que se inició en la década de 1950, casi llevaron a la desaparición de la enfermedad. Después de las exitosas campañas de erradicación, los sistemas de salud de atención primaria debían dar el último empujón hacia la erradicación del pián. Sin embargo, una combinación de varios factores, incluyendo un pobre compromiso político y una financiación limitada, dieron como resultado el abandono progresivo de los esfuerzos y el resurgimiento de la enfermedad. Cada nuevo caso de pián era la decepcionante confirmación de que el mundo de la salud pública había perdido una gran oportunidad. Hoy la enfermedad de pián ha resurgido en muchas áreas tropicales con nuevos desafíos: una situación epidemiológica desconocida, formas clínicas atípicas o atenuadas, poco conocimiento de la enfermedad entre el personal sanitario, la falta de datos acerca de la eficacia del tratamiento clásico con penicilina inyectable y la necesidad de desarrollar esquemas terapéuticos simplificados o investigar en nuevos tratamientos antibióticos, en especial de administración oral. Actualmente hay una enorme brecha de conocimiento entorno a la información epidemiológica fiable sobre la enfermedad. Ciertamente, sabemos poco acerca de la incidencia en los tres países melanesios, donde la enfermedad es altamente endémica, Papúa Nueva Guinea (PNG), Islas Salomón y Vanuatu. En las Islas Salomón y Vanuatu, las cifras de incidencia son muy altas lo que demuestra que el pián es una enfermedad frecuente y ampliamente extendida, pero sabemos que el diagnóstico no es muy fiable. Esto nos lleva al siguiente punto: ¿Cuáles son los criterios diagnósticos del pián? En general, la historia natural de la enfermedad en la época actual, donde la bacteria es objeto de presión antibiótica inadecuada, no es muy clara. Algunos autores han escrito que el pián parece presentar manifestaciones “atenuadas” en las Islas Salomón y Vanuatu. Afirman que la afectación ósea en el pián es poco frecuente, lo que implica que el pián es una enfermedad leve que no requeriría esfuerzos para su eliminación. Sin embargo, el primer trabajo de esta tesis describe la epidemiología del pián en la Isla de Lihir (Papúa Nueva Guinea) y muestra una alta tasa de úlceras primarias clásicas (casi el 60 % de casos) y una afectación significativa del hueso y periostio (más del 15 %) que sugiere que la "atenuación" no es un tema importante. Cuando nos fijamos en los criterios diagnósticos, únicamente signos y síntomas todavía se utilizan en muchas áreas para el diagnóstico de la enfermedad. Esta confianza en los hallazgos clínicos fue el resultado de la dificultad de realizar pruebas serológicas en las zonas remotas. Hoy en día, las pruebas serológicas rápidas son simples, rápidas, económicas y útiles para orientar la confirmación de los casos. El diagnóstico clínico del pián es complicado debido a que sus manifestaciones pueden ser inespecíficas. Así, es posible, que una proporción significativa de los casos de pián puedan haber sido falsamente diagnosticados. En el primer artículo, presentamos que, en nuestra experiencia, sólo el 60 % de los casos con sospecha clínica de pián fueron finalmente confirmados por pruebas serológicas. Por lo tanto, un diagnóstico adecuado del pián requiere la interpretación de los hallazgos clínicos con referencia a los resultados de laboratorio y la historia epidemiológica de los pacientes. Las pruebas serológicas en el pián no sólo son importantes para el diagnóstico de la enfermedad, también son muy útiles en la definición de curación después del tratamiento. En la prueba de la Reagina plasmática rápida (RPR) los títulos deben descender a los 6 - 12 meses, llegando a ser negativa en menos de 2 años. El segundo artículo de esta tesis combina un enfoque clínico / serológico para evaluar la respuesta a bencilpenicilina benzatina, e identifica una tasa de fracaso terapéutico del 20 % a los 12 meses del tratamiento. Esto podría estar relacionado con resistencia al fármaco antimicrobiano, o bien indicar una re-infección por re-exposición. La distinción entre la re-infección y la resistencia verdadera al tratamiento es difícil, pero estos fracasos terapéuticos son preocupantes. En este artículo se describe un modelo multivariante realizado para identificar los factores determinantes del fracaso terapéutico. El riesgo de re-infección causado por el contacto repetido con otros niños infectados parece ser un predictor fundamental de fracaso. También es un factor de riesgo, los títulos basales bajos (< 1 : 32) de RPR. Este último factor podría estar relacionado con la mayor dificultad para resolver infecciones crónicas (en estadio secundario), habitualmente acompañadas de títulos bajos. Con la enfermedad de pián re-emergiendo, el desarrollo de nuevas estrategias contra la infección para hacer más fácil los esfuerzos de erradicación es esencial. La penicilina inyectable sigue siendo eficaz, pero el tratamiento con un fármaco por vía oral que pueda ser fácilmente administrado a gran escala es el método preferido para el tratamiento, prevención y finalmente eliminación en todas las regiones endémicas del mundo. Hasta la fecha, no ha habido estudios que comparen directamente la eficacia de la penicilina con cualquiera de los agentes alternativos en el tratamiento de las <b>treponematosis</b> no venéreas. El cuarto artículo de esta tesis ha demostrado que una dosis única de azitromicina por vía oral no es inferior a la bencilpenicilina benzatina intramuscular, para el tratamiento del pián en niños en Papúa Nueva Guinea. En un ensayo abierto, aleatorio, el 96 % de los pacientes tratados con azitromicina estaban curados a los 6 meses de seguimiento, al igual que el 93 % en el grupo de bencilpenicilina benzatina. Las perspectivas de finalmente erradicar el pián son ahora mayores, mediante el uso de una dosis única de azitromicina oral en campañas masivas de tratamiento. El tratamiento masivo con azitromicina ha sido ampliamente utilizado para el control del tracoma, que, al igual que el pián es una enfermedad de comunidades rurales pobres de países en desarrollo. También se ha utilizado de una manera más limitada para controlar el granuloma inguinal y brotes de sífilis venérea. En general, el uso de azitromicina ha demostrado ser seguro, y de hecho ha habido beneficios inesperados de salud en algunos programas. La eliminación del pián y la filariasis linfática en las Islas del Pacífico Sur se considera ahora biológicamente factible y operacionalmente alcanzable. El Programa Global para Eliminar la Filariasis Linfática (GPELF) se ha expandido rápidamente para alcanzar la meta de eliminación en el año 2020. Por otro lado la estrategia para eliminar el pián es nuevamente centro de atención. Además, dado que los seres humanos infectados son la única fuente de la enfermedad, su eliminación podría lograrse en un plazo relativamente corto. El quinto artículo de la tesis revisa de forma integral el tratamiento con antimicrobianos y las estrategias de eliminación contra el pián. Con el fin de controlar el pián hasta la erradicación, se propone pasar de la penicilina a la azitromicina, y el uso de campañas de tratamiento masivo de toda la población en todas las comunidades endémicas. Además, para asegurar que todos los casos son encontrados y tratados, serán necesarias medidas estrictas de seguimiento y tratamiento masivo selectivo hasta llegar al objetivo de cero casos clínicos. Es importante destacar que el principio de interrupción de la transmisión se debe probar en estudios piloto, incluyendo estudios de prevalencia, para monitorizar el impacto de la intervención, y también la valoración de resistencia a macrolidos, que en nuestra opinión, serán herramientas fundamentales que nos guíen en el camino hacia una eliminación sostenible La filariasis linfática (FL), causada por el nematodo Wuchereria bancrofti, es otro de los grandes problemas de salud pública en los países de la Melanesia. Un curso de MDA anual, durante cinco años, es la estrategia que la OMS recomienda para eliminar la FL. Este enfoque tiene como objetivo suprimir la microfilaremia en los individuos infectados y disminuir los niveles de infección por debajo de un umbral que conduzca a la interrupción de la transmisión. Sin embargo, trabajo teórico y experiencia práctica clínica han puesto de relieve cómo la diversidad ecológica, entre diferentes...|$|E
