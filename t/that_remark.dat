He'd had a serious war and he survived and Miller thought, 'He's my old Services mate. The last thing he wants after five years' war is to be flattened by a cricket ball, so I eased up.

News of the appropriation set off celebrations among Fairbanks residents who hoped its construction would prove a boon for the local economy.|$|E
500|$|In February 2010, Bernd Schuster {{was asked}} if Raúl did not favour Villa moving to Real Madrid, to which he responded, [...] "I have a cough," [...] which caused many {{to believe that he}} was {{implying}} the rumour to be true. Villa firmly ridiculed that idea by saying, [...] "It is impossible that a player with as much class on and off the pitch as Raúl would speak poorly of me. I have always had a good relationship with Raúl, even though we have hardly met on international duty." [...] Speaking about Raúl's record with the Spanish national team as the nation's leading top scorer, Villa said, [...] "I've got 25 goals but he's got 44 and is still playing. I'd be delighted to reach that tally as I'd help the national team achieve great victories and, in many years' time, I could see my name on a [...] that another young lad was trying to beat. That would be great." [...] On 25 March 2011, two years after making <b>that</b> <b>remark,</b> Villa surpassed Raúl as Spain's all-time top scorer.|$|E

He appears on the network's NBA {{coverage}} during pre-game and halftime shows, in addition to special NBA events. He also occasionally works as an onsite game analyst. He is part of the crew on Inside the NBA, a post-game show during which Barkley, Ernie Johnson Jr., Kenny Smith and Shaquille O'Neal recap and comment on NBA games that have occurred during the day and also on general NBA affairs. During the broadcast of a game, in which Barkley was courtside with Marv Albert, Barkley poked fun at NBA official Dick Bavetta's age. Albert replied to Barkley, [...] "I believe Dick would beat you in a footrace." [...] In response to <b>that</b> <b>remark,</b> Barkley went on to challenge Bavetta to a race at the 2007 NBA All-Star Weekend for $5,000. The winner was to choose a charity to which the money would be donated. The NBA agreed to pitch in an additional $50,000, and TNT threw in $25,000. The pair raced {{for three and a half}} lengths of the basketball court until Barkley ultimately won. After the event, the two embraced in a show of good sportsmanship.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{scheduled}} to premiere at RKO's flagship theater Radio City Music Hall on February 14, but in early January 1941 Welles was not finished with post-production work and told RKO that it still needed its musical score. Writers for national magazines had early deadlines and so a rough cut was previewed for a select few on January 3, 1941 for such magazines as Life, Look and Redbook. Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper (and Parsons' arch rival) showed up to the screening uninvited. Most of the critics at the preview said that they liked the film and gave it good advanced reviews. Hopper wrote negatively about it, calling the film a [...] "vicious and irresponsible attack on a great man" [...] and criticizing its corny writing and old fashioned photography. Friday magazine ran an article drawing point-by-point comparisons between Kane and Hearst and documented how Welles had led on Parsons, Hollywood correspondent for Hearst papers. Up until this Welles had been friendly with Parsons. The magazine quoted Welles as saying that he couldn't understand why she was so nice to him and that she should [...] "wait until the woman finds out that the picture's about her boss." [...] Welles immediately denied making the statement {{and the editor of}} Friday admitted that it may be false. Welles apologized to Parsons and assured her that he had never made <b>that</b> <b>remark.</b>|$|E

[...] The historian Pei Songzhi commented that Cao Cao made <b>that</b> <b>remark</b> – which suggests that Liu Bei was not wise enough to notice Hanzhong's strategic importance – because of his personal disdain for Liu, and {{that it should not}} be taken seriously. He felt that a lord acting on his adviser's suggestion should not be interpreted as a sign that the lord was not wise enough to make his own judgment. He pointed out that Cao Cao himself also followed the advice of his adviser Guo Jia.|$|E

Owner Hank Steinbrenner suggested that Mussina should [...] "learn how to pitch like Jamie Moyer", and no longer rely so much on his fastball. Although <b>that</b> <b>remark</b> was widely interpreted as a slight, Mussina joked in response that he could not pitch like Moyer because he did not throw left-handed, and afterwards he excelled, going 91 in his subsequent eleven starts. On June 15, he recorded his 10th win of the season, extending his American League record to 17 consecutive seasons with at least 10 wins. On September 18, Mussina notched his 18th victory of the season and led the Yankees to a 92 victory over the first place White Sox in his final start at Yankee Stadium.
