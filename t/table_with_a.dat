5|$|Jane sits at {{her kitchen}} <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pistol when a figure leaps through her window and hacks {{off one of}} her arms. The wound sprays blood over the kitchen walls before Jane falls to the floor. The killer {{continues}} to hack at her until she is dead, at which point Neal is revealed to be the murderer. Upon learning the details of Berti's sadistic murder spree, Neal recovered a previously repressed memory involving his murder of a girl who had sexually humiliated {{him when he was}} a youth in Rhode Island. The memory torments Neal and inflames his previously repressed lust for blood, driving him insane.|$|E

5|$|Although Emerson {{credits his}} grandfather's {{gift of a}} Barlow knife {{to him at the}} age of eight years with {{starting}} his interest in knives, it was not until later in life that he turned to making them. The summer of 1978 found Emerson in need of a balisong knife for his study of a Filipino martial art and, unable to afford one on his salary, Emerson decided he would attempt to make his own instead. He milled and drilled the handles from aluminum stock; the knife's blade was a simple steel blank that he hand cut with a hacksaw, shaped with files, and heat treated at his dining room <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> butane torch.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left it on the kitchen <b>table,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it in the kitchen, it did not have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E
5|$|Gannon became {{manager of}} Stockport County, {{now in the}} National League North, {{for the third time}} in his career on 18 January 2016. Gannon started off well, taking the team to the Cheshire Senior Cup final and up to ninth in the <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{sequence}} of seven games unbeaten, including five victories, in the run up to Easter. County finished eighth in the 2016–17 season, one point outside the play-offs. Gannon was credited with turning around the career of Danny Lloyd, who signed for Peterborough United in May 2017, 12 months after Gannon had persuaded him to play for County rather than quit the game altogether. Gannon said that he was pleased with his defence, but wanted to overhaul the attacking side so as to reach the play-offs the following season.|$|E

5|$|In January 2002, {{chairman}} Doug Ellis {{once again}} appointed Graham Taylor as manager. Villa finished the 200102 season in eighth place, which {{was similar to}} most of their other Premiership finishes. Taylor quit as manager {{for the second time}} {{after the end of the}} 200203 season. Villa had just finished 16th in the Premiership, losing twice to arch rivals Birmingham City. David O'Leary, who had taken Leeds United to the semi-finals of the 200001 Champions League, was brought in as Taylor's replacement. O'Leary took the team to sixth in the <b>table,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 20 home defeat against Manchester United on the final day meaning that they narrowly missed out on a UEFA Cup place. In 200506, Villa slowly fell down the table and finished in 16th place. The poor placing came despite O'Leary having spent more than £13million the previous summer on players such as Milan Baroš, Kevin Phillips and Wilfred Bouma.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} main match, Ric Flair faced Shawn Michaels. During the match, Michaels {{set up a}} table at ringside and {{positioned}} Flair on it. Randy Orton then came through the audience and attempted to interfere in the match, but Michaels performed Sweet Chin Music on him and put Flair through the <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Splash. Near {{the end of the}} match, Michaels knocked the referee down and {{as he was about to}} perform a Sweet Chin Music on Flair, allowing Orton to hit Michaels with a chair. Orton then placed Flair on top of Michaels and ran out of the ring. When the referee recuperated, he saw the cover and officiated the pinfall made by Flair.|$|E
5|$|On 4 February, {{the team}} beat União de Leiria {{at home by}} 3 goals to 2. Benfica took the lead with a goal from João Tomás. Roger and Van Hooijdonk {{increased}} their lead by two goals, until Nuno Valente settled the final score. With this win, Benfica climbed to second place the league, now only five points behind leader Boavista. On the 16th, Benfica played Estrela da Amadora away from home. The game ended with a 2–1 victory for Benfica. Along with Boavista's loss in Braga, this further reduced Benfica's separation from the league leader. Benfica played their last match of February on the 25th against Boavista. Benfica {{had an opportunity to}} take the top place in the league <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> victory in that game, but they were unsuccessful at breaking the 0–0 draw. Van Hooijdonk had the best chance in the 78th minute, but his attempt struck the goalpost.|$|E

5|$|The event, {{featuring}} commentary by Michael Cole, Jerry Lawler and Booker T, {{began with}} the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match. During the bout, Sheamus slammed Sin Cara through a ladder propped between the ring apron and the announcers' <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> powerbomb. The ladder was bent in half and Cara was stretchered away from ringside. Near {{the end of the}} match, Barrett, Rhodes and Bryan were the only three in the ring. Bryan put Rhodes in a guillotine choke submission hold on top of the ladder {{in the middle of the}} ring while Barrett sneaked up the other side of the ladder. After Bryan knocked Rhodes off the ladder, Barrett got Bryan onto his shoulders and tried to throw him off. Bryan countered with repeated elbow strikes to Barrett's head. Bryan then kicked Barrett in the head and unhooked the briefcase to win the contest.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match to}} {{take place on the}} event's card was the Six Man Tag Team Tables match pitting the team of Johnny Devine and Team 3D against the team of Jay Lethal and MCMG. The match lasted {{fourteen}} minutes and fifty-nine seconds. The objective of a Six Man Tag Team Tables match is to drive {{one of the members of}} the opposing team through a table. During the contest, Lethal drove Devine through a <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> driving elbow drop. However, as the referee was scripted to appear unconscious, this allowed Team 3D to knockout MCMG and Lethal with the X Division Championship belt. They followed by draping Devine over Lethal, making it appear as though Devine had drove Lethal through the table, thus winning the match for his team.|$|E
5|$|After Al-Rasheed was {{promoted}} to the top division, most of Iraq's national team players signed for them, which {{made it difficult for}} the other teams to compete. Even so, in the 1985–86 Iraqi National League and under the management of Yahya Alwan, Al-Talaba won their third league title against all expectations. They finished the season with 25 points, two points ahead of the favourites Al-Rasheed. On 27 December 1985, {{one of the most important}} matches of the season, which could have decided the championship, was played between Al-Talaba and Al-Rasheed in front of 50,000 spectators at the Al-Shaab Stadium. The match ended in a 1–0 win for Al-Talaba with the goal being from a penalty taken by Hussein Saeed in the 63rd minute. Saeed was the season's joint top goalscorer along with Ahmed Radhi and Rahim Hameed. Al-Talaba participated in the 1986 Asian Club Championship where they reached the final round but finished last in the <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single point. Al-Talaba also participated in the Saddam International Tournament in 1986, hosted in Baghdad, but finished third in their group and failed to reach the semi-finals. By winning the league, Al-Talaba qualified for the 1986 Al-Muthabara Cup but were defeated 2–1 by Al-Rasheed.|$|E

5|$|Barça's 2012–13 season {{yet again}} {{began with a}} Supercopa contention, this time another {{incarnation}} of El Clásico. Barcelona would win the first leg at home 3–2 with goals from Messi, Pedro and Xavi, but in the second leg, despite a wonderfully-struck free kick from Messi from 35 yards out, Barcelona would succumb 2–1 to their fiercest foes with goals from Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higuaín. In La Liga, Barcelona would shoot straight {{up to the top}} of the league <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 5–1 win over Real Sociedad. In the most-hyped game of the season so far, Barcelona and Real Madrid would play out what many regard as the best Clásico in recent memory, ending in a 2–2 draw at the Camp Nou with both Messi and Ronaldo netting twice for their respective clubs. Barça would also kick of their Copa del Rey defence with a 3–0 win over Alavés. In the Champions League on 7 November 2012, Barcelona would fall 2–1 to Celtic, with Messi grabbing his third Champions League goal of the 2012–13 season in the 90th minute in Glasgow. Barcelona were eliminated from Europe 0–7 on aggregate in the semi-finals against eventual champions Bayern Munich, the worst-ever aggregate loss in any European competition for the club.|$|E
5|$|During the close-season, Johnson {{sought a}} {{possible}} new club back in England, {{and before the}} start of the 2010 season in America, he was given a trial with Major League Soccer side Seattle Sounders FC joining them for their pre-season training camp. Having trained with Sounders, Johnson decided to stay with Austin Aztex and signed a new two-year contract. In the first game of the Aztex season, Johnson hit the goalpost with a 20-yard curling shot, but Lawrence Olum scored with the rebound, helping the Aztex to a 2–0 victory against Montreal Impact. During May, Johnson scored five goals, including two in a 3–3 draw with Tampa Bay and made two assists to help Austin record an unbeaten spell. He again scored two goals in a 2–1 Aztex victory over Miami and helped take his team to the top of the table by being the club's leading goalscorer throughout the campaign. Heath also used him in his original position in attack, including as a sole striker in a defeat to Puerto Rico Islanders. It was a result that saw the Aztex lose their top spot for the first time in three months. A week later, Johnson scored his tenth goal of the season to give his side their fourth win in five games by defeating Carolina RailHawks 3–2. The Aztex returned to the top of the <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 2–0 victory against NSC Minnesota Stars with Johnson scoring the opening goal of the game. Aztex qualified for the end-of-season play-offs where they faced Montreal Impact over two legs. Johnson scored one of Aztex's two goals in the second leg but their season finished with a 5–2 aggregate defeat. Johnson played a total of 28 games during the season, scoring 15 goals, and earned a place in the 2010 season best XI.|$|E
