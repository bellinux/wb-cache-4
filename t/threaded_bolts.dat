2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{components}} that make up a drum's anatomy. Some of these anatomical components vary dependent upon the type of drum, the manufacturer, and the year in which it was made. However, nearly all modern drums have the same essential components. Kick drums often have legs called [...] "spurs" [...] {{on either side of the}} drum shell. These spurs are used to prevent the kick drum from rolling side to side, to prevent the drum from sliding forward as it is being played and to provide overall added stability to the drum. Casings, also known as lugs, vary in shape and size. They all serve the same purpose as the receiving end of the drum tension rod (also known as a tuning screw) and provide the anchor point for the tension rods themselves. Casings are found on nearly all modern drums. The number of casings a drum has can vary from drum to drum and manufacturer to manufacturer. A drum can have as little as six casings and as many as twelve. Tension rods, also known as tuning screws, are <b>threaded</b> <b>bolts</b> that are placed around the rim of a drum and screw into the casings. They enable the musician tp adjust the tension of the drum's head and effect it's overall pitch, tone, and timbre. They come in many lengths and should also always have a tension rod washer that is often made of metal or hard plastic.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{behaviour}} of bolted steel connections subjected to tension. Quasi-static conditions have been considered. By performing laboratory tests on single bolts and simple T-stub connections the failure modes of the bolts have been examined. Finite element models are created and validated to represent the behaviour observed in the laboratory. Different grip length configurations have been tested for a single bolt and nut assembly subjected to pure tension. Both partially and fully <b>threaded</b> <b>bolts</b> have been considered. It was found that partially <b>threaded</b> <b>bolts</b> with three threads between the unthreaded part of the shank and the bearing surface of the nut experienced thread stripping. This is inconsistent with the recommendations given in NS-EN 1090 - 2, which states that one full thread is sufficient to avoid thread stripping. Finite element models are able to recreate the behaviour of all configurations tested with acceptable accuracy. In addition to the grip length, the material properties and geometry of the threads are identified as the crucial factors for the failure modes of the bolts. Simple T-stub connections with one bolt in each flange have been tested to examine the behaviour of the bolts when they are subjected {{to a combination of}} tension and bending. The center distance between the bolts was varied to examine the behaviour when subjected to increased bending effects. Connections with partially <b>threaded</b> <b>bolts</b> all failed due to thread stripping. The fully <b>threaded</b> <b>bolts</b> experienced both thread stripping and bolt failure. The complexity of the stress distribution when large bending effects are present was difficult to recreate with a simplified finite element model. Acceptable accuracy up to maximum force was possible to achieve for the smallest bolt center distance. The response of the finite element model was very mesh sensitive, and difficult to recreate with limited computational capacity when applying an explicit solution algorithm...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Hodder Avenue {{underpass}} – {{recipient of}} the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI) ’s Harry H. Edwards Industry Advancement Award – is a new highway bridge near Thunder Bay, Canada that utilized a modular construction approach facilitated by the extensive use of ultra-high performance fibre-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) to expedite construction, elevate aesthetic value and enhance quality and durability. Almost all structural components were precast in facilities and assembled on site using UHPFRC joints, which have compact geometries with less complexity, superior durability and strength. The precast elements include a unique UHPFRC pier cap and pier column shells, high performance concrete (HPC) box girders, sidewalks/parapet walls, abutment caps, ballast walls, slope paving panels and approach slabs. Aesthetically, the structure achieved a slender and open form {{with the use of}} shallow precast box girders and a unique pier cap visually and structurally integral with the superstructure. The cap beam was prestressed and precast fully with UHPFRC to overcome design challenges such as geometrical limitations and complex loading. The pier cap and girders were made composite using field-cast UHPFRC joints reinforced with stainless steel bars and <b>threaded</b> <b>bolts.</b> The pier columns also utilized a unique design with precast UHPFRC shells serving as an aesthetic stay-in-place form as well as a protective layer for the salt splashes during Thunder Bay’s harsh winter seasons...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{test results}} {{to evaluate the}} slip and fatigue performance of Resin Injected Bolted Joints (RIBJs) for pultruded Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) material. The objective of the test series {{is to provide a}} robust method of connection for structural engineering that is both fatigue and slip resistant. Forty-six joints (using 23 specimens) were subjected to either static or combined static/cyclic loading at ambient room temperature. Ten specimens (five batches of two) had bolted connections without injected resin and were included to provide baseline static joint strengths. Sikadur®- 30 and RenGel®-SW 404 were the two cold-curing epoxy based resins used to fabricate the 13 RIBJ specimens. Testing was conducted with double lap-shear joints in accordance with modified guidance from Annex G and Annex K in standard BS EN 1090 - 2 : 2008. The specimen’s geometry was established using this British Standard and an American Society of Civil Engineers pre-standard for pultruded thin-walled structures. Rectangular plates for the lap joints were cut from either a wide flange section of size 254 × 254 × 9. 53 mm or a flat sheet of 6. 35 mm thickness. Bolting was with either M 16 or M 20 steel <b>threaded</b> <b>bolts</b> of Grade 8. 8. Sixteen specimens, for eight batches of two specimens were failed in a short duration for static strength. Four RIBJ specimens had static load cycling to an assumed service load level. Three specimens out of 23 were subjected to staged static and cyclic fatigue loadings to determine stiffness changes, life-time ‘slip’ load and residual joint strength. The reported results are evaluated for slip and fatigue performance and the main finding is that resin injection shows much promise as a mechanical method of connection in pultruded FRP structures...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} provide the joint {{versatility}} for pultruded fibre reinforced polymer (PFRP) in civil structures industry is crucial for its application demands. Bolted joint is extensively used in the industry due to low cost and ease of assembly.
