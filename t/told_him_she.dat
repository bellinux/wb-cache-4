5|$|Too weak {{to stand}} or walk, Beauchamp was loaded onto a cart to be {{conveyed}} to the gallows. He begged to see Anna, but the guards <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> was not seriously injured. The guards finally {{allowed him to}} see Anna, and Beauchamp was angered that they had underplayed her critical condition. He stayed with her until {{he could no longer}} feel her pulse; then the guards took him to the gallows to be hanged before he died of his stab wounds.|$|E
5|$|Icke visited Shine four times. During {{the third}} meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke felt {{something}} like a spider's web on his face, and Shine <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> had a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world. Icke {{had been sent to}} heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would allow us to go wherever we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilized by having oil taken from the seabed.|$|E
50|$|Leiningen is {{cold and}} remote to her, rebuffing all her {{attempts}} {{to make friends with}} <b>him.</b> <b>She's</b> beautiful, independent, and arrives ready to be his stalwart helpmate; however, no one has <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she's</b> a widow. He rejects her because he had wanted to marry a virgin.|$|R

5|$|In his {{subsequent}} statement Smith admitted to {{being at the}} Rainbow with Corcoran and a male friend, but claimed they were later separated {{when they went to}} another public house, the Kerryman, and the male friend was ejected. Smith said that he and Corcoran then went to Monte Carlo's, a nightclub in Handsworth, and that when they left some time later, Corcoran was confronted by a man he described as a Teddy Boy, with whom she had argued at the Kerryman. Smith said that the man became aggressive, so he asked Corcoran if she wanted to go home. Claiming that she <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> did not, he said he then left her.|$|E
5|$|After {{a memorable}} 90th birthday, {{where she was}} {{surrounded}} by her now vast family, Zita's strong health began to fail. She developed inoperable cataracts in both eyes. Her last big family gathering took place at Zizers, in 1987, when her children and grandchildren joined in celebrating Empress Zita's 95th birthday. While visiting her daughter, in summer 1988, she developed pneumonia {{and spent most of}} the autumn and winter bedridden. Finally, she called Otto, in early March 1989, and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> was dying. He {{and the rest of the}} family travelled to her bedside and took turns keeping her company until she died in the early hours of 14 March 1989. She was 96 years old, and was the last surviving child of Robert, Duke of Parma from both his marriages.|$|E
5|$|Gardstein's {{body was}} removed {{to a local}} {{mortuary}} where his face was cleaned, his hair brushed, his eyes opened and his photograph taken. The picture, and descriptions {{of those who had}} helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those they were looking for. A local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassilleva, after she had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> {{had been one of the}} people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information began to come in from the public and the group's associates: on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured.|$|E

5|$|Henry Blackwell began {{a two-year}} {{courtship}} of Stone {{in the summer}} of 1853. Stone <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> did not wish to marry because {{she did not want to}} surrender control over her life and would not assume the legal position occupied by a married woman. Blackwell maintained that despite the law, couples could create a marriage of equal partnership, governed by their mutual agreement. They could also take steps to protect the wife against unjust laws, such as placing her assets in the hands of a trustee. He also believed that marriage would allow each partner to accomplish more than he or she could alone, and to show how he could help advance Stone’s work, he arranged her highly successful western lecturing tour of 1853. Over an eighteen-month courtship conducted primarily through correspondence, Stone and Blackwell discussed the nature of marriage, actual and ideal, as well as their own natures and suitability for marriage. Stone gradually fell in love and in November 1854 agreed to marry Blackwell.|$|E
5|$|Opening {{arguments}} by both {{prosecution and}} defense set up cases based on purported times of death. Basing their assertion on pathologist-given testimony that Jones had died {{about six hours}} after she ate lunch on May 26, the prosecution claimed that Jones had died more than 24 hours before Kinne and Boldizs found her body; defense attorneys argued that death had more likely occurred six to eight hours prior. Prosecutor J. Arnott Hill cited testimony by Chief of Detectives Lieutenant Harry Nesbitt and by Patricia Jones's husband, Walter, as evidence of Kinne's motive for the crime: the detective recalled statements by Kinne that she was afraid Jones was drifting away from her despite the financial support she offered him, and Jones testified that Kinne had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> was pregnant by him and he had thereafter attempted to end the relationship.|$|E
5|$|Yogesh is impatient, but Devu {{keeps the}} bride a secret. When she enters, Yogesh cannot tell who she is. When the {{ceremony}} ends, Devu welcomes {{the father of}} the bride: Sanjana's father. Yogesh is stunned when his grandfather brings the money to pay Jitu's debts. He asks Devu how he arranged the marriage; Devu explains that when Sanjana followed him and showed him a picture of her boyfriend, he remembered seeing the boyfriend kissing another woman in Khandala. He brought Sanjana to a hotel in Khandala to confront her boyfriend. Sanjana <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> would marry Yogesh, having realised that she loves him. The film ends with the marriage attendants asking Sanjana's astrological sign. Sanjana asks Yogesh what her raashee is, to which he says he does not know, and smiles.|$|E

5|$|On February 15, 2008, Beshear {{unveiled}} his promised {{legislation that}} would allow casino gambling in Kentucky. Beshear's plan included a constitutional amendment allowing 12 casinos to be licensed in the state – seven {{at each of the}} state's horse racetracks and five additional free-standing casinos – and a companion bill specifying how the increased revenues would be spent. After the plan encountered initial resistance, House leadership reduced the number of casinos that would have been allowed to by the amendment to nine. One proposal, authored by House Speaker Jody Richards, would have guaranteed five casino licenses to the state's racetracks and allowed the other four to go to free-standing casinos. A competing measure, drafted by House Majority Whip Rob Wilkey and Speaker Pro Tem Larry Clark, would have allowed all nine licenses to be awarded competitively, with none specifically reserved for racetracks. In late February, the House Elections, Constitutional Amendments, and Intergovernmental Affairs committee failed to advance either proposal to the full floor of the House of Representatives. The following day, Speaker Richards removed Representative Dottie Sims from the committee; Sims claimed Richards retaliated against her for voting against the proposals, but Richards said he removed Sims because she <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> would vote for the proposals and then voted against them. Following Sims' removal the committee passed the amendment.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} weeks of the summer, Cisneros called Fischer several times and {{asked him why he}} had broken up with her daughter. He told her Cristina was very kind, but he wanted to be single and date other girls. Cisneros then called Fischer's father, Buddy, and asked him why his son had broken up with Cristina. Fischer was angry that Cristina did not return his ring, and wrote a letter to her saying that he wanted his ring in ten days, or he would take action. Cisneros then called Buddy and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> wanted to talk about his son's ring and other things; both agreed to meet at a Burger King. Cisneros asked Buddy why Fischer broke up with Cristina, and Buddy said that was between his son and her. He said his son was old enough to make his own decisions, and that he would not get involved. Cisneros then asked him if he knew Fischer drank, and he responded that at his son's age it was not {{uncommon}} to drink. Cisneros then said she had seen Fischer drunk once before, but his father responded by saying if he had been drunk before, it was not in his presence. Sex never came up in the conversation. Buddy told Cisneros he would speak to his son about acting like a gentleman; Cisneros promised to return Fischer's ring. Buddy recalled the meeting was awkward but friendly.|$|E
5|$|Police interviewed Farrar at 6:20 a.m, informing him {{immediately}} that {{the bodies of}} Tim and Kelly had been recovered. He told police about the deterioration of his marriage and health {{over the past six}} months. In August 1995, Farrar had fallen ill with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He initially assumed it was a residual effect of the traveler's diarrhea many people on the Peru trip had contracted while there. Though he recovered from the initial bout of symptoms, he relapsed about a week later, and on August 18 Farrar was hospitalized with severe dehydration and high fever. In the hospital, he developed sepsis. Doctors identified Streptococcus viridans, which had probably leaked through damaged digestive tissue as a result of Farrar's severe diarrhea, as the source of the sepsis; however, they could not pinpoint the root cause of the gastrointestinal illness itself. Though Farrar's illness was severe and possibly life-threatening, he eventually recovered and was released from the hospital on August 25. That night, however, shortly after eating a dinner that Green had served him, Farrar again suffered vomiting and diarrhea and had to be hospitalized. A third bout of symptoms struck on September 4, days after he was released from the hospital for the second time. Basing their conclusions on the likelihood that his illness was related to the Peru trip, doctors narrowed down the possible causes for Farrar's gastrointestinal issues to a handful, though none fitted his symptoms perfectly: typhoid fever, tropical sprue, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Farrar had noticed that each time he returned home from the hospital, he became ill again almost immediately, and he speculated that it may have been due to the stress of his dissolving marriage or the change from a bland hospital diet to a normal home one. When Farrar's girlfriend, Margaret Hacker, <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> suspected Green was poisoning him, he initially wrote off the idea as ridiculous.|$|E

25|$|Fontanne went {{to great}} lengths to avoid divulging her true age. Her husband {{reportedly}} died believing she was five years younger than he (as she had <b>told</b> <b>him).</b> <b>She</b> was, in fact, five years older, but continued to deny, long after Lunt's death, that she was born in 1887.|$|E
25|$|Law did {{not attend}} the IWA General Council {{meetings}} between August 1870 and October 1871.

25|$|In {{addition}} to his difficult lifelong relationship with his parents, Reimer {{had to deal with}} unemployment and the death of his brother Brian from an overdose of antidepressants on July 1, 2002.

On the morning of May 4, 2004, Reimer drove to a grocery store's parking lot in his hometown of Winnipeg and took his own life by shooting himself {{in the head with a}} sawed-off shotgun. He was 38 years old.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with other}} Ripper victims, Kelly's origins are obscure and undocumented, {{and much of}} it is {{possibly}} embellished. Kelly may have herself fabricated many details of her early life as there is no corroborating documentary evidence, but {{there is no evidence to}} the contrary either. According to Joseph Barnett, the man she had most recently lived with prior to her murder, Kelly had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> was born in Limerick, Ireland, in around 1863—although whether she referred to the city or the county is not known—and that her family moved to Wales when she was young.|$|E
