He also claimed that as a child, he performed to family, neighbors and teachers unexpected feats such as moving a heavy rabbit hutch using Archimedean principles and small logs, building radios and winning arguments with parents and teachers at an early age.

50|$|In the 1990s, {{with the}} advent of high-definition video, {{television}} engineers created the 1.78 (16:9) ratio as a mathematical compromise between the theatrical standard of 1.85 and television's 1.33, as it was not practical to produce a traditional CRT <b>television</b> <b>tube</b> with a width of 1.85.

When the frames are updated rapidly enough, changes in those images provide the illusion of continuous motion. This makes normal <b>television</b> <b>tubes</b> unsuitable for computer displays, where the image is generally static for extended periods of time (as it is while you read this). The solution is to use additional hardware and computer memory to store the image between each update, a section of memory known as a framebuffer.|$|R
