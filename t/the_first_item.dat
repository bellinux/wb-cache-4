Often <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>item</b> of parliamentary business was a public reading and reaffirmation of the Charter, and, {{as in the previous}} century, parliaments often exacted confirmation of it from the monarch. The Charter was confirmed in 1423 by King Henry VI.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>item</b> on {{the agenda}} for Wisconsin's 1905 {{legislature}} was to elect a Senator. La Follette nominated himself and was confirmed by the State Senate. He kept serving as Governor and left Wisconsin's U.S. Senate seat unfilled until January 1, 1906, when he resigned to join the U.S. Senate. He publicly proclaimed this unusual action was done to ensure that his 1904 platform was enacted in Wisconsin.|$|E
25|$|Despite these difficulties, {{negotiations}} on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>item</b> continued. In March, {{a delegation of}} six members of Congress travelled to Havana {{to meet with the}} FARC negotiators and the encounter was described as productive and respectful. Senator Roy Barreras (Partido de la U) declared that the peace process was moving forward, to stages never reached in prior peace processes. On May 26, both sides announced a partial agreement on the first point, comprehensive rural reform. The agreement focused on the issues of land access and use, unproductive land, property titles, rural development, infrastructure, social development in rural regions, agricultural and livestock production, technical assistance, subsidies and credits, food and nutritional policies.|$|E
25|$|In 1942 a {{rationing}} {{system was}} begun to guarantee minimum amounts of necessities to everyone (especially poor people) and prevent inflation. Tires were <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>item</b> to be rationed in January 1942 because supplies of natural rubber were interrupted. Gasoline rationing proved {{an even better}} way to allocate scarce rubber. In June 1942 the Combined Food Board {{was set up to}} coordinate the worldwide supply of food to the Allies, with special attention to flows from the U.S. and Canada to Britain. By 1943 one needed government issued ration coupons to purchase coffee, sugar, meat, cheese, butter, lard, margarine, canned foods, dried fruits, jam, gasoline, bicycles, fuel oil, clothing, silk or nylon stockings, shoes, and many other items. Some items, like automobiles and home appliances, were no longer made. The rationing system did not apply to used goods like clothes or cars, but they became more expensive since they were not subject to price controls.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>items</b> of postal {{stationery}} {{to be issued}} by Hungary were postcards in 1869 followed by envelopes in 1871 and newspaper wrappers in 1872. Lettercards were issued in 1886 and aerogrammes were first issued in 1969.|$|R

50|$|Snacks are <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>items</b> presented. Two or more small {{dishes are}} brought to the table, holding boiled {{unsalted}} peanuts, salted roasted peanuts, or similar dishes. These may be consumed while ordering, or while waiting for other dishes to arrive.|$|R
25|$|Microsoft Word {{supports}} bullet {{lists and}} numbered lists. It {{also features a}} numbering system that helps add correct numbers to pages, chapters, headers, footnotes, and entries of tables of content; these numbers automatically change to correct ones as new items are added or existing items are deleted. Bullets and numbering can be applied directly to paragraphs and convert them to lists. Word 97 through 2003, however, had problems adding correct numbers to numbered lists. In particular, a second irrelevant numbered list might have not started with number one, but instead resumed numbering after the last numbered list. Although Word 97 supported a hidden marker that said the list numbering must restart afterwards, the command to insert this marker (Restart Numbering command) was only added in Word 2003. However, if one cut <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>item</b> of the listed and pasted it as another item, e.g. fifth, the restart marker would have moved with it and the list would have restarted in the middle instead of at the top.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 4 Stephanie Wilson and Naoko Yamazaki grappled and berthed the Multi-purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) Leonardo. The MPLM was berthed to {{the station}} at 04:24 UTC (00:24 EDT). The hatches were opened by station flight {{engineer}} Soichi Noguchi and shuttle mission specialist Clayton Anderson at 11:58 UTC (07:58 EDT). The joint STS-131/Expedition 23 crews began transferring cargo from the MPLM, with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>item</b> being a Rate Gyro Assembly (RGA) which will be replaced on the first spacewalk of the mission. During flight day 4 commander Alan Poindexter did several in-flight interviews. Commander Poindexter was joined by mission specialists Rick Mastracchio and Stephanie Wilson. The interviews were with the Tom Joyner Radio Show, WVIT-TV and Fox News Radio. At {{the end of the}} day Mastracchio and Anderson entered the Quest airlock and begin breathing pure oxygen for an hour, while the atmospheric pressure inside the airlock was lowered to 10.2 psi. This procedure is known as the pre-breathe protocol and is done before every spacewalk, to purge nitrogen from the blood stream and prevent decompression sickness.|$|E
25|$|While discussions {{advanced}} on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>item</b> on {{the agenda}} (integral rural development), the peace process faced its first major crisis {{at the end of}} January 2013 following the kidnapping of two police officers by the FARC in the Valle del Cauca on January 25. The incident was followed by a FARC ambush which killed four soldiers in the Nariño Department on January 31, and the assassination of another three police officers in La Guajira Department on February 1. The FARC claimed that these actions were in retaliation of a military bombing which left 20 guerrillas dead, during the FARC's unilateral ceasefire (which came to an end on January 20). Government negotiators in Havana argued that such actions undermined the peace process. In bringing the war to the negotiating table, both sides broke their previous understanding not to let events of the conflict affect the process, and the dispute escalated into a war of words between the two parties. The government, pressed by former President Uribe's fiery opposition to the peace process, sternly warned the FARC that it would respond in kind and would not be pressured into discussing a bilateral ceasefire (as demanded by the FARC).|$|E
50|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>items</b> on <b>the</b> {{parliamentary}} {{agenda of}} the Partition Sejm (1773-1775), which acceded to <b>the</b> <b>First</b> Partition of Poland, was the assessment in how to best utilise the former Jesuit property and declaration of a firm intention to {{the continuity of the}} education system.|$|R

25|$|Thor is {{a superb}} hand-to-hand combatant, and is skilled in armed combat, excelling {{in the use}} of the war hammer, sword, axe and mace. Thor {{possesses}} two items which assist him in combat: the enchanted Belt of Strength, and his signature weapon, the mystical hammer Mjolnir. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>item</b> doubles Thor's strength and endurance while the second is used to control his weather abilities; flight; energy projection and absorption; dimensional travel; matter manipulation and the most powerful of his offensives, the God Blast (which taps into Thor's life force, and has even forced Galactus to flee), the Thermo-blast, and the Anti-Force (which counteracts another force). Using Mjolnir by throwing it in the desired direction and then holding on to the handle's leather loop, Thor can fly at supersonic speeds in Earth's atmosphere and travel faster than light in space. He can also use the hammer to create a barrier by letting it spin in a circle, and even managed to contain an explosion powerful enough to destroy a 1/5th of the universe, although at the cost of his own life. He can throw an object out of Earth's atmosphere by using his strength, and throw his hammer to Asgard from which it will return.|$|E
500|$|Since September 2012, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>item</b> of {{business}} on Tuesday afternoons is usually Time for Reflection {{at which a}} speaker addresses members for up to four minutes, sharing a perspective on issues of faith.

[...] The other secret item is a cousin of the Prince, which, once rolled up in main gameplay, can be used as a character in the various multiplayer modes. However, cousins can only be found and rolled up after the game is beaten. The game also tracks which objects the player has collected at any time, allowing them to review all the various objects within the game.|$|E

For some reason {{it does not appear}} in a royal inventory of 1441; Jenny Stratford suggests that this was because Beaufort still had it at this point.
