5|$|No. 30 <b>Transport</b> <b>Unit</b> was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{unit that}} {{operated}} during the Korean War. It {{was formed in}} November 1950 as No.30 Communications Unit and based at Iwakuni, Japan, as part of No.91 (Composite) Wing. The unit was initially equipped with four Douglas C–47Dakotas and two Austers, one of the Dakotas being the personal transport of Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson, commander of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF). Another four Dakotas were sent to Japan due to operational demands. The unit's role in Korea was to support No.77 (Fighter) Squadron by transporting supplies and equipment. It also delivered materials and stores to Australian and Commonwealth ground forces, and transported VIPs of the United Nations Command. Return journeys to Japan were often used to evacuate wounded personnel from the theatre. No.30 Communications Unit was redesignated No.30 <b>Transport</b> <b>Unit</b> in November 1951, and re-formed as No.36 (Transport) Squadron in March 1953. The squadron remained in Korea following the armistice, and returned to Australia in June 1955.|$|E
5|$|No. 38 Squadron {{was formed}} as a <b>transport</b> <b>unit</b> at RAAF Base Richmond near Sydney on 15 September 1943. Equipped with Lockheed Hudsons, the {{squadron}} conducted its first operation on 17 December, when one of its aircraft flew from Richmond to RAAF Base Darwin. During the period No. 38 Squadron was equipped with Hudsons, it operated only within Australia.|$|E
5|$|No. 38 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) <b>transport</b> <b>unit.</b> It {{was formed}} in 1943 and saw service during World War II {{transporting}} supplies and personnel between Australia and the combat zones in New Guinea and Borneo, using Douglas Dakota aircraft. Following the war, the squadron conducted regular courier flights between Australia and Japan in 1947 and 1948. No. 38 Squadron was deployed to Singapore from 1950 to 1952, supplying Commonwealth forces engaged in the Malayan Emergency and undertaking courier flights across Asia. In 1954 it became responsible for training RAAF personnel to operate Dakotas.|$|E

As early as December 1961, the 3rd Truck Transportation Group of PAVN's General Rear Services Department had become the first motor <b>transport</b> <b>unit</b> fielded by North Vietnamese to work the trail {{and the use of}} motor transport escalated.|$|E
5|$|Transport Flight (Japan) was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) <b>transport</b> <b>unit</b> that {{operated}} {{in the aftermath}} of the Korean War. It was formed in March 1955 at Iwakuni, Japan, and equipped with three Douglas C-47Dakotas and a CAC Wirraway. The flight's main duty was flying a regular courier service between Japan and South Korea in support of Commonwealth military units based on the peninsula. Transport Flight (Japan) ceased operations in June 1956 and disbanded in September that year.|$|E
5|$|No.30 Communications Flight was re-designated No.30 Communications Unit in November 1950, and No.30 <b>Transport</b> <b>Unit</b> a year later, before re-forming as No.36 (Transport) Squadron in March 1953. It {{undertook}} medical evacuation, cargo and troop transport, and courier flights. No.77 Squadron {{converted to}} Gloster Meteor jets between April and July 1951, and operated {{primarily in the}} ground attack role from December that year. It remained in Korea on garrison duty following the July 1953 armistice, and returned to Australia in November 1954; No.491 Squadron disbanded the same month. No.36 Squadron returned to Australia in March 1955, leaving four aircraft to equip the newly formed RAAF Transport Flight (Japan), which briefly came under No.91 Wing's control. The following month, No.391 Squadron and No.91 Wing headquarters were disbanded.|$|E

5|$|On 10March 1953, No.30 <b>Transport</b> <b>Unit</b> re-formed as No.36 (Transport) Squadron, {{which had}} disbanded the {{previous}} day at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales. Between the armistice in July {{and the end of}} August 1953, the squadron repatriated over 900 Commonwealth prisoners of war. As of 30November 1954, its strength was seven Dakotas and one Wirraway, and eighty-seven personnel including seven officers. Elements of No.36 Squadron began returning to Australia in January 1955, {{and by the end of}} the month its strength was four Dakotas and one Wirraway, and fifty-eight personnel including five officers. Nominal operational control of the squadron was transferred to Fifth Air Force on 1February 1955, though its purpose continued to be the support of Commonwealth forces. No.36 Squadron ceased flying on 13March, after which its remaining elements departed Iwakuni for Australia, leaving three Dakotas and a Wirraway that formed RAAF Transport Flight (Japan); the flight operated until July 1956 and was disbanded two months later.|$|E
5|$|On 22June 1949, No.86 Wing, {{comprising}} Nos.36, 38 and 486 Squadrons, relocated from Schofields to {{the nearby}} RAAF Station Richmond. The return of crews from Berlin allowed the wing to release No.38 Squadron and its Dakotas {{to participate in the}} Malayan Emergency, under the control of No.90 (Composite) Wing, commencing in June 1950. After airlifting more than 17,000 passengers and evacuating over 300 injured troops, the squadron left Malaya in November 1952 and returned to No.86 Wing at Richmond. A month earlier, the wing's Dakotas had flown supply and observation flights in connection with the British atomic test on Montebello in Western Australia. No.36 Squadron disbanded at Richmond on 9March 1953, re-forming the next day from No.30 <b>Transport</b> <b>Unit</b> at Iwakuni, Japan. Here it was part of No.91 (Composite) Wing, which controlled the RAAF's units during the Korean War and its immediate aftermath. The squadron returned to Australia and the aegis of No.86 Wing two years later, when No.91 Wing disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Somervell {{returned}} to Washington Barracks {{to attend the}} Engineer School but his course was interrupted by the declaration of war by the United States on Germany on 6 April 1917. The course was abruptly terminated and Somervell, along with hundreds of other junior officers, was ordered to appear before an examination board that would determine his fitness for promotion. Following a favorable report from the board, Somervell was promoted to captain on 15 May 1917. He helped organize the 15th Engineers, a rail <b>transport</b> <b>unit,</b> at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In July 1917 this became the first engineer regiment to be sent overseas, arriving in England in July 1917 and France later that month. The 15th Engineers worked on a several construction projects, including a munitions dump at Mehun-sur-Yèvre and an advanced depot and regulating station at Is-sur-Tille. Somervell got his projects completed by working his men around the clock and deploying every available resource regardless of the cost. For his role, Somervell was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E

5|$|The first air <b>transport</b> <b>unit</b> in SWPA {{was called}} the Air Transport Command, which was formed at RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland on 28 January 1942. It was {{equipped}} with five C-53s originally bound for the Philippines, and two B-18s and a C-39 that had escaped from there. Only two of the original 14 pilots were fully qualified on transports; the remaining 12 had to be retrained. Of the 19 airmen, 12 were trained as aircrew members. It was redesignated the 21st Transport Squadron on 3 April. On the same date, the 22nd Transport Squadron was formed at Essendon Airport in Victoria with former KNILM and RNEIAAF aircraft that had arrived in Australia from Java. The two squadrons were redesignated the 21st and 22nd Troop Carrier Squadrons on 26 July. The RAAF formed four transport squadrons in February and March 1942, and No. 33 Squadron RAAF began flying a regular passenger and freight service from Townsville to Port Moresby on 5 March. It received Avro Ansons in September and a detachment was sent to Port Moresby the following month. Aircraft of No. 36 Squadron RAAF also made occasional trips to New Guinea in 1942, and twenty RAAF pilots were seconded to US troop carrier squadrons.|$|E
5|$|When the Korean War {{broke out}} on 25June 1950, No.77 (Fighter) Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) was based at Iwakuni, Japan. For the {{previous}} four years the squadron, equipped with North American P-51 Mustangs, had served with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF). Personnel were preparing to return to Australia when they were placed on standby for action over Korea; the squadron began flying missions as part of United Nations (UN) forces a week later. Following the landing at Inchon and the consequent advance northward of UN troops, No.77 Squadron relocated to Pohang, South Korea, on 12October 1950. It left behind its main support elements at Iwakuni. No. 91 (Composite) Wing was established at the base on 20October and given administrative responsibility for all RAAF units operating during the conflict. This included No.77 Squadron and three newly formed components: No.30 Communications Flight (renamed No.30 Communications Unit the following month, No.30 <b>Transport</b> <b>Unit</b> in November 1951 and No.36 (Transport) Squadron in March 1953), No.491 (Maintenance) Squadron, and No.391 (Base) Squadron. Apart from No.77 Squadron, the wing's units were all headquartered at Iwakuni.|$|E
