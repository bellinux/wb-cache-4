50|$|The {{problem can}} be {{eliminated}} by minimising slack spring travel, and by {{reducing the amount of}} trailer braking force applied for a given drawbar force. However this results in the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> bearing some of the trailer braking load, something the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> is often not designed to do. The result is compromised braking.|$|R

5000|$|A weight-distributing hitch is a [...] "load leveling" [...] hitch. It is a hitch setup {{mounted on}} the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle</b> that uses spring bars and chains under tension to {{distribute}} part of the trailer's hitch weight from the towing vehicle's rear axle to the towing vehicle's front axle and to the trailer's axle(s). It can help reduce trailer sway and hop. Trailer hop can jerk the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Trailer sway is sometimes called [...] "fish tailing". At high speeds, trailer sway can become dangerous. Most vehicle manufacturers will only allow a maximum trailer capacity of 5000 lb and 500 lb of tongue weight without using a weight-distributing hitch. Tow vehicles often have square receiver sockets to accept weight distributing hitches.|$|E
5000|$|These are {{available}} for loads between 10000 and 30000 lb. They are used for larger trailers and provide considerably more stability than does a traditional hitch. Both styles have trailers attach to a coupler mounted above the axle within {{the bed of the}} <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle</b> such as a flat deck or pickup truck. A fifth-wheel coupling is also referred to as a kingpin hitch and is a smaller version of the semi-trailer [...] "fifth wheel". Though a fifth wheel and a gooseneck trailer look much the same, their method for coupling is different. A fifth wheel uses a large horseshoe-shaped coupling device mounted a foot or more above the bed of the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle.</b> A gooseneck couples to a standard 2+5/16 in ball mounted on the bed of the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The operational difference between the two is the range of movement in the hitch. The gooseneck is very maneuverable and can tilt in all directions, while the fifth wheel is intended for level roads and limited tilt side to side. Gooseneck mounts are often used for agricultural and industrial trailers. Fifth-wheel mounts are often used for recreational trailers. Standard bumper-hitch trailers typically allow a 10% or 15% hitch load while a fifth wheel and gooseneck can handle 20% or 25% weight transfer.|$|E

5000|$|... {{since the}} <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> is still slowing down, the whole cycle repeats itself. The result {{is not only}} severe vibration, {{but the lack of}} {{effectiveness}} of the trailer brakes leaves the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> to do nearly all the braking. The front vehicle thus also fails to brake effectively, and lateral stability is also compromised, risking a jackknife situation.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} factor in towing safety is tongue weight, the weight with which the trailer presses down on the tow vehicle's hitch. Insufficient tongue weight can cause the trailer to sway back and forth when towed. Too much tongue weight can cause problems with the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
