5|$|As {{early as}} 1786, Marshall had been implicating several {{prominent}} Kentucky politicians in {{a scheme to}} take Kentucky out of the Union and into alliance with Spain. After the expiration of his Senate term, he resumed these charges <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> the Western World newspaper. His allegations resulted in a legislative investigation of Kentucky Court of Appeals judge Benjamin Sebastian, who {{was found to be}} receiving a pension from Spain and resigned from the bench. Federal judge Harry Innes was also a target of Marshall's allegations, and the two became embroiled in a legal battle that lasted almost a decade. Innes hired William Littell to write and publish a book giving Innes' version of his dealings with Spain. Marshall countered by publishing his History of Kentucky in 1812. Although blatantly partisan, it became the most widely read history of the state at the time. Marshall and Innes ended their legal battle with an agreement, signed in 1815, that neither would publish anything negative about the other again. Innes upheld his part of the agreement, but in 1824, years after Innes' death, Marshall published an updated edition of his History of Kentucky which was just as vitriolic as the previous version had been. Marshall faded from public life during his later years. He died at the home of his son in Lexington, Kentucky on July 3, 1841.|$|E

25|$|The {{stories are}} {{formatted}} so that, {{after a couple}} of pages of reading, the protagonist faces two or three options, each of which leads to more options, and then to one of many endings. The number of endings is not set, and varies from as many as 44 in the early titles, to as few as 8 in later adventures. Likewise, there is no clear pattern among the various titles regarding the number of pages per ending, the ratio of good to bad endings, or the reader's progression backwards and forwards <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> the book. This allows for a realistic sense of unpredictability, and leads to the possibility of repeat readings, {{which is one of the}} distinguishing features of the books.|$|E

Jennings did {{much of the work}} himself, including life-sized models of fairy tales. The park, originally separate from Idlewild, opened in 1956. Story Book Forest featured many attractions such as a pirate ship, a castle, and many live storybook characters.

According to Subhas Chandra Bose, {{a proponent of}} armed struggle for Indian independence, Vivekananda was [...] "the maker of modern India"; for Gandhi, Vivekananda's influence increased Gandhi's [...] "love for his country a thousandfold". Vivekananda influenced India's independence movement; his writings inspired independence activists such as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Aurobindo Ghose, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Bagha Jatin and intellectuals such as Aldous Huxley, Christopher Isherwood, Romain Rolland. Many years after Vivekananda's death Rabindranath Tagore told French Nobel laureate Romain Rolland, [...] "If {{you want to know}} India, study Vivekananda. In him everything is positive and nothing negative". Rolland wrote, [...] "His words are great music, phrases in the style of Beethoven, stirring rhythms like the march of Händel choruses. I cannot touch these sayings of his, scattered as they are <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> books, at thirty years' distance, without receiving a thrill through my body like an electric shock.

2500|$|The New York Times said of Landon, [...] "Though {{a serious}} and {{prolific}} scholar, Mr. Landon also {{had a knack for}} making musicology seem exciting to the general public." [...] Charles Rosen, in a review of Landon's five-volume Haydn compendium, expressed admiration and gratitude to the author for his energy in bringing all of Haydn's music, particularly the complete symphonies, to publication: [...] "Only a few decades ago there were still immense tracts of unexplored Haydn. ... That we are better off today is owing {{in large part to the}} work of Robbins Landon." [...] However, he faults Landon for haphazard scholarship and analysis, observing that [...] "much of what he writes is sensitive and penetrating, and it is all informed by a great love of Haydn and an enthusiasm which would be infectious if the book were not so disorganized and unsystematic. ... He writes like a man going quickly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> Haydn's works and pointing out to a friend the passages he likes most." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{still at}} college, Jaquays became {{interested}} in science-fiction and fantasy gaming and the nascent role-playing game industry <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> The Space Gamer. Jaquays discovered Dungeons & Dragons in 1975 and formed the Fantastic Dungeoning Society with several friends at college including Mark Hendricks. Together they decided to create a fanzine, which would provide adventures for other Game Masters. TSR's Tim Kask gave Jaquays a casual license to publish this fanzine, The Dungeoneer, an amateur publication {{but one of the}} earliest RPG periodicals. The first issue was published in the same month as Dragon #1 (June 1976). The first issue was mainly drawn and written by Jaquays, with some contributions from other FDS members. In all, FDS produced six issues of The Dungeoneer from 1976-1978. Marketed as a [...] "dungeonmaster's publication," [...] the magazine was noteworthy for its pioneering approach to pre-factored adventures, [...] "F'Chelrak's Tomb" [...] was published in June 1976, the same month as Wee Warriors' Palace of the Vampire Queen. The publication has been an inspiration for many similarly-themed magazines in the United States and elsewhere. In addition to these [...] "honest efforts at quality contents to interest readers," [...] Jaquays began submitting artwork to TSR's in-house gaming magazine, The Dragon, in 1976. Her work appeared in the premiere issue of The Dragon, and later contributions included the cover of issue #21.|$|E
