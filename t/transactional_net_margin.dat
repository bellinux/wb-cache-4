The group both sells galley equipment and spare parts {{as well as}} carrying out installation of the marine foodservice areas in both new build vessels and in vessels where an old galley is changed into a new one. The group also provides its customers with turnkey deliveries, which are when the supplier has the overall responsibility for the delivery of a marine foodservice area. Marine Food group transfers goods and services between the enterprises situated in Finland, Sweden and the US and has not established a transfer pricing system for these transactions. The company located in Singapore was recently established and any intra-group transactions have not been conducted yet. This master’s thesis aims at developing a transfer pricing system that could be applicable on these transactions and acceptable to the tax authorities in Finland, Sweden and the US. The elements that should be included when developing a transfer pricing system is functional analysis, economic analysis, an analysis of transactions, selection of transfer pricing method and comparables. The Marine Food group is therefore analyzed based on these elements {{in order to be}} successful in developing a transfer pricing system. Furthermore, the transfer pricing rules in Finland, Sweden and USA is examined in order to develop a transfer pricing system that is acceptable to the tax authority in respective country. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has issued Transfer Pricing Guidelines, which are another significant source that are examined when establishing a transfer pricing system for Marine Food group. Spare parts are transferred between the Swedish company, Marine Food AB and the US based company, Marine Food LLC. The transfer pricing method that should be applied in Sweden is the resale price method since Marine Food LLC operates like a reseller for the spare parts. Internal comparables exist and comparability for the purposes of resale price method can be established with reference to both internal and external data. In the US, the comparable profit method should be applied given that it meets the best method rule. The transactions from the Finnish Company, Marine Food Oy and the Swedish company, Marine Food AB consist of installation works and stainless steel furniture. Hence, the transactions both involve goods and services and should be looked at separately. The transfer price for the installation works should be set by using the <b>transactional</b> <b>net</b> <b>margin</b> method. In order to determine the transfer price under the <b>transactional</b> <b>net</b> <b>margin</b> method both internal and external comparables can be used in this case. The transfer price for the stainless steel furniture should on the other hand be established using the resale price method. In order to determine comparability external comparables are used due to lack of internal data. Marine Food AB sells galley equipment and spare parts to Marine Food Oy. The transfer pricing method that should be applied on these transactions is the resale price method since the least complex party in the transaction, Marine Food Oy, act like a reseller of the galley equipment and spare parts.

40|$|This master’s thesis has {{analyzed}} the issues multinational enterprises (MNE) have when determining the arm’s length price from {{intra group services}} rendered from a group service center (GSC). The thesis {{is based on the}} recommendations from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the legislations in Sweden, Germany, USA, and Denmark. There are several factors that could cause issues for services rendered from a GSC. GSCs render services to the members of a MNE. These types of services are often managerial, supervisory, marketing, or other kinds of services, which are preformed more efficiently if centralized in the MNE rather than if each member of the MNE would perform the services themselves. The research has shown three specific issues that have caused problems for MNEs: When is a service chargeable? Is the applied method for charging appropriate? And, how should the remuneration be determined? The concerned countries have different rules and regulations towards dealing with these issues, which have caused problems for MNE operating in these countries. There is no other category of transaction that has caused as much disagreement between taxpayers and tax authorities as intra group services. Countries seem to have different approaches towards when services are chargeable, which in situations create disputes between taxpayers and the countries’ tax authorities. The appropriate method for charging is dependent of the concerned countries. Three of the countries have a negative attitude towards indirect charging, while one has no preference. Consequently, this has caused problems for MNE to price services. Three of the countries apply the OECD’s recommendations, when determine the appropriate pricing method. OECD has a hierarchy of the methods, whereas USA applies the best method rule, which means that they have no preference over a certain pricing method. The most common methods for pricing services are the cost plus method and the <b>transactional</b> <b>net</b> <b>margin</b> method. However, there are situations where some of the countries do not approve a profit element in the charge. In these situations, the OECD‘s recommendations do not provide a clear and straight answer, whereas the US Regulations have very strict and clear regulations when a service should be charged without a profit element. There could be many factors to why countries have different interpretations: ambiguous recommendations from the OECD; subjective opinions from governments, tax authorities and courts; protectionism; language barriers; accounting standards; the differences in the legal value of the OECD recommendations; and probably other factors which has not been considered. Inferentially, the OECD should be more open to a “US approach”, by giving more clear, precise and direct recommendations. A “US approach” gives more predictability to practitioners. Direct, clear and precise recommendations will give less room for interpretation, thus, less confusion in practice. Even if this has to be accepted by countries it should lead to less confusion and hopefully decrease double taxation for MNEs...|$|E
40|$|A methodological {{approach}} {{to determine the}} optimum time to control weeds that integrates aspects of weed biology, weed-crop competition, and economics is presented. The approach {{is based on the}} concept of Time Density Equivalent: this is defined as the density of weed plants that germinate with the crop and compete until harvest that causes the same yield loss caused by a group of weeds with a given density, time of emergence, and time of removal. A model was developed that accounts for pattern of weed emergence and permits determination of timing of weed control that minimizes economic loss due to weeds emerging both before and after treatments. The outcomes of the model are presented with two examples: corn in competition with velvetleaf and soybean in competition with Amaranthus cruentus. For both crops, six different weed control strategies involving preemergence, chemical, and mechanical postemergence treatments are considered. The results obtained with the model are compared with the calculation of <b>net</b> <b>margin</b> based on assumptions of simultaneous emergence of crop and weeds and no effect of different times of control. Different control strategies are compared considering not only maximum <b>net</b> <b>margin</b> but also its dependence on time of control, because a strategy with a lower value of maximum <b>net</b> <b>margin,</b> but a flatter <b>net</b> <b>margin</b> curve, allows more flexibility of time of control...|$|R

The objective of this work was to evaluate the economic behavior of four food crop and supplementary forage rotations using indicators of profitability and profit variability. Productive data were used from a long-term experiment (16 yr) in the central valley of Chile under conditions of irrigation. With productive data and information on historic input/output prices, the real <b>net</b> <b>margin</b> per rotation (RNMR) and its coefficient of variation (CV) were determined. The {{results indicated that the}} highest economic benefits and greatest economic stability were obtained with rotations that only included crops, namely sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L. subsp. vulgaris) -wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) -bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) -barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (CR 2) and corn (Zea mays L.) -wheat-bean-barley (CR 4). These rotations included crops with low CV of the <b>net</b> <b>margin,</b> such as wheat, barley and beans, with values between 0. 31 and 0. 34. The rotations with crops and pasture, sugar beet-wheat-red clover (Trifolium pratense L.)

The selection of crops for rotations and their sequence were determining factors in the economic behavior of rotations, affecting the level of RNMR and the degree of inter-annual variability of this indicator. Thus, differences among rotations of 47 % in <b>net</b> <b>margin</b> were determined (CR 2 vs. CR 1), which only differed in the replacement of pasture with red clover (2) by bean-barley.
