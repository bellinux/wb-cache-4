5|$|Justification {{for using}} the Sunnah {{as a source of}} law can be found in <b>the</b> <b>Qur'an.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Qur'an</b> {{commands}} Muslims to follow Muhammad. During his lifetime, Muhammad made it clear that his traditions (along with <b>the</b> <b>Qur'an)</b> should be followed after his death. The overwhelming majority of Muslims consider the sunnah to be essential supplements to and clarifications of <b>the</b> <b>Qur'an.</b> In Islamic jurisprudence, <b>the</b> <b>Qur'an</b> contains many rules for the behavior expected of Muslims but there are no specific Qur'anic rules on many religious and practical matters. Muslims believe that they can look at the way of life, or sunnah, of Muhammad and his companions to discover what to imitate and what to avoid.|$|E
5|$|The Al Hayat Museum is the complex's most {{recognized}} establishments; {{it consists}} of ten halls spread over two floors, exhibiting rare Qur'anic manuscripts from different periods, starting from the first century Hijra (700AD). Manuscripts on parchments that originate from Saudi Arabia (Mecca and Medina), Damascus and Baghdad, {{are present in the}} museum. The manuscripts undergo special procedures for the preservation of these artifacts, in order to protect them from damages. Some of the artifacts present in the museum include a rare manuscript of <b>the</b> <b>Qur'an,</b> dating to 1694AD and was printed in Germany. The museum also houses the world's oldest translated copy of <b>the</b> <b>Qur'an,</b> which was translated to Latin in Switzerland and dates to 955AD. The first copy of <b>the</b> <b>Qur'an,</b> written during the reign of Caliph Uthman ibn Affan, is on display in the museum alongside a number of small copies of <b>the</b> <b>Qur'an,</b> which could only be read using optical instruments.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} justifications, found in <b>the</b> <b>Qur'an</b> and sunnah, {{for the use}} of ijtihad. For example, during a {{conversation}} with Mu'ādh ibn Jabal, Muhammad asked the former how he would give judgments.

40|$|Abstract—This study {{seeks to}} give a {{comparative}} account of passive constructions in terms of semantic functions in <b>the</b> Holy <b>Qur'an</b> where they are widely used in its chapters and verses [...] A comparison and contrast is indirectly made between what grammarians stated in their books and the cases found in <b>the</b> Holy <b>Qur'an.</b> This is to identify the functions stated by the grammarians and not mentioned in <b>the</b> Holy <b>Qur'an</b> and those found in <b>the</b> Holy <b>Qur'an</b> but not stated by the grammarians.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Qur'an</b> is {{the first}} and most {{important}} source of Islamic law. Believed to be the direct word of God as revealed to Muhammad through angel Gabriel in Mecca and Medina, the scripture specifies the moral, philosophical, social, political and economic basis on which a society should be constructed. The verses revealed in Mecca deal with philosophical and theological issues, whereas those revealed in Medina are concerned with socio-economic laws. <b>The</b> <b>Qur'an</b> was written and preserved during the life of Muhammad, and compiled soon after his death.|$|E
5|$|Various {{sources of}} sharia {{are used by}} Islamic {{jurisprudence}} to elucidate the body of Islamic law. The primary source accepted universally by all Muslims is <b>the</b> <b>Qur'an,</b> the majority adhering also to the traditionally reported Sunnah, but rejected by others; Quranism. <b>The</b> <b>Qur'an</b> is the holy scripture of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the direct and unaltered word of God. The Sunnah consists of the alleged religious actions and quotations of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, narrated through his Companions and the Imams (per the beliefs of the Sunni and Shi'ite schools respectively).|$|E

5|$|Holland {{looks at}} the {{earliest}} evidence for Muhammad, Mecca and Islam {{in the first century}} of the Arab Empire, pointing to a lack of evidence in the historical record to support the traditional account. Highlighting that very little Muslim testimony from the 7th century exists, he considers it suspect that 30 years after Muhammad's death, Muawiyah I became leader of the Arab Empire in Jerusalem despite showing little sign of being Muslim, and that no mention of Muhammad or Islam can be found in any of Muawiyah's inscriptions, coins, or documents. Holland proceeds to note that {{with the exception of a}} single ambiguous reference in <b>the</b> <b>Qur'an,</b> there is no mention of Mecca in any datable text for a century after Muhammed's death. He points out that in <b>the</b> <b>Qur'an,</b> the Prophet appears to address farmers and agriculturalists while his opponents are described as keeping cattle and growing olives and vines. This appears to describe an environment foreign to Mecca, where there was no agriculture; thus Holland posits that the location attributed to Mecca in <b>the</b> <b>Qur'an</b> more closely fits a city in the Negev desert, in what is now southern Israel.|$|E

40|$|Arguably, {{among the}} sources of Islamic radicalization in Indonesia is the {{interpretation}} of certain terminology in <b>the</b> holy <b>Qur’an.</b> In a relatively long period, religious understanding of Indonesian society is shaped by the official Translation of <b>the</b> Holy <b>Qur’an</b> by Ministry of Religious Affairs. However, this translation contains several mistakes, including mistakes in translating key terms relating {{to the issue of}} warfare, non-Muslims and killing. This eventually contributes to radicalization of some element of Muslim society in Indonesia. The purpose of this research is to analyze error translation of <b>The</b> Holy <b>Qur’an</b> verses. Content analysis theory is applied in this research with grammatical and cultural approach against <b>the</b> Holy <b>Qur’an</b> translation by Ministry of Religious Affairs of Indonesia (MORA). The research shows that 90 fatal errors in translation of <b>The</b> Holy <b>Qur’an</b> verses regarding infidels and polytheists are confirmed.

5|$|As Islamic {{regulations}} {{stated in}} the primary sources do not explicitly deal with every conceivable eventuality, jurisprudence must refer to resources and authentic documents to find the correct course of action. According to Sunni schools of law, secondary sources of Islamic law are consensus, {{the exact nature of}} which bears no consensus itself; analogical reason; pure reason; seeking the public interest; juristic discretion; the rulings of the first generation of Muslims; and local customs. Hanafi school frequently relies on analogical deduction and independent reasoning, and Maliki and Hanbali generally use the Hadith instead. Shafi'i school uses Sunnah more than Hanafi and analogy more than two others. Among Shia, Usuli school of Ja'fari jurisprudence uses four sources, which are Qur'an, Sunnah, consensus and the intellect. They use consensus under special conditions and rely on the intellect to find general principles based on <b>the</b> <b>Qur'an</b> and Sunnah, and use the principles of jurisprudence as a methodology to interpret <b>the</b> <b>Qur'an</b> and Sunnah in different circumstances. Akhbari Ja'faris rely more on tradition and reject ijtihad. According to Momen, despite considerable differences in the principles of jurisprudence between Shia and the four Sunni schools of law, there are fewer differences in the practical application of jurisprudence to ritual observances and social transactions.|$|E

5|$|The {{legal system}} of Saudi Arabia {{is based on}} Sharia, Islamic law derived from <b>the</b> <b>Qur'an</b> and the Sunnah (the traditions) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The sources of Sharia also include Islamic {{scholarly}} consensus developed after Muhammad's death. Its interpretation by judges in Saudi Arabia {{is influenced by the}} medieval (Islamic Golden Age) texts of the literalist Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence. Uniquely in the Muslim world, Sharia has been adopted by Saudi Arabia in an uncodified form. This, and the lack of judicial precedent, has resulted in considerable uncertainty in the scope and content of the country's laws. The government therefore announced its intention to codify Sharia in 2010, but this is yet to be implemented. Sharia has also been supplemented by regulations issued by royal decree covering modern issues such as intellectual property and corporate law. Nevertheless, Sharia remains the primary source of law, especially in areas such as criminal, family, commercial and contract law, and <b>the</b> <b>Qur'an</b> and the Sunnah are declared to be the country's constitution. In the areas of land and energy law the extensive proprietorial rights of the Saudi state (in effect, the Saudi royal family) constitute a significant feature.|$|E
