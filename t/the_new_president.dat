5|$|Because Vice President Carlos Álvarez {{had already}} resigned, the Congress convened {{to appoint a}} new president. Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, {{governor}} of the San Luis Province, was in office for two months while calling for new presidential elections. Renewed demonstrations forced him to resign as well, and Eduardo Duhalde was appointed as <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>president.</b> He was able to complete De la Rúa's term of office.|$|E

5|$|Unlike in his {{previous}} congressional term, when Weaver entered the 49th United States Congress, {{he was the only}} Greenback member. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>president,</b> Democrat Grover Cleveland, was friendly to Weaver, and asked his advice on Iowa patronage.

5|$|After Arias' {{death in}} 1988, Endara became a leading {{opponent}} of the Manuel Noriega military dictatorship, heading the opposition coalition in the 1989 presidential election. Though his coalition was judged by international observers as having defeated pro-Noriega candidate Carlos Duque, the results were annulled by the government, and Endara and his running mates were attacked in the streets by the paramilitary Dignity Battalions. The assaults received widespread coverage in international media, helping to build support within the U.S. for military action against Noriega. Seven months later, the United States invaded Panama, and swore in Endara as <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>president</b> {{on the first night}} of the invasion on a U.S. military base.|$|E
5|$|After eight years, Fetter {{returned}} to academia and finally completed his B.A. in 1891. In 1892, Jeremiah W. Jenks—who had taught Fetter at Indiana University—acquired a teaching position at Cornell University at <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>President</b> White School of History and Political Science and subsequently secured a fellowship for Fetter at that institution. Fetter completed his Master of Philosophy degree the same year. Jenks then convinced Fetter to study, as Jenks himself had, under Johannes Conrad at the Sorbonne in Paris, France. Fetter earned his Ph.D. in 1894 from the University of Halle in Germany, where {{he wrote his}} doctoral dissertation, a critique of Malthusian population theory.|$|E
5|$|By lending his {{prestige}} to Kennan's position, {{the president}} tacitly signaled {{his intention to}} formulate the strategy of his administration {{within the framework of}} its predecessor's, despite the misgivings of some within the Republican Party. The critical difference between the Truman and Eisenhower policies of containment had to do with Eisenhower's concerns that the United States could not indefinitely afford great military spending. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>president</b> thus sought to minimize costs not by acting whenever and wherever the Soviets acted (a strategy designed to avoid risk) but rather whenever and wherever the United States could afford to act.|$|E

Members of both parties in Congress agreed to convene a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which ultimately decided the race for Hayes.|$|E
5|$|Having {{passed his}} exam, Middleton was {{recommended}} for a commission by President Howard Taft in November 1912, but it wasn't until after <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>President,</b> Woodrow Wilson, {{was sworn in}} the following March, and the new congress convened, that the 56 successful candidates were confirmed by the Senate. Their appointment was back-dated to 30 November 1912. During this interim period, Middleton was transferred to Fort Crockett in Galveston, Texas, where he arrived early in 1913.|$|E
5|$|Nigeria regained {{democracy}} in 1999 when it elected Olusegun Obasanjo, the former military head of state, as <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>President</b> of Nigeria. This ended almost 33 years {{of military rule}} (from 1966 until 1999), excluding the short-lived second republic (between 1979 and 1983) by military dictators who seized power in coups d'état and counter-coups during the Nigerian military juntas of 1966–1979 and 1983–1998. Although the elections that brought Obasanjo to power in 1999 and again in 2003 were condemned as unfree and unfair, Nigeria has shown marked improvements in attempts to tackle government corruption and to hasten development.|$|E

Truman (Art Baker), continues to support the atomic project, now moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico.

5|$|Services were {{initially}} traditional, following the Polish rite. Men and women sat separately, but the mehitza separating them was soon done away with.

Traditionalists—who mostly came from the Hebrew Benevolent Society—objected and withdrew, forming their own Orthodox minyan, which eventually became Oakland's Congregation Beth Jacob.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of John F.

Senator Birch Bayh succeeded Kefauver as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments and set about advocating for a detailed amendment dealing with presidential disability.|$|E

Menem's accession marked the first time since Hipólito Yrigoyen took office in 1916 that an incumbent government was peacefully succeeded by a president from an opposition party.|$|E

5|$|A luncheon at the U.S.Capitol {{has been}} part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that time, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the {{outgoing}} President and First Lady). The menu for the 2009 inaugural luncheon, which often features dishes representative of the home states of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>President</b> and Vice President, included seafood stew, duck and pheasant entrees with Pinot noir wine, and a dessert of apple cinnamon sponge cake with sweet cream glacé. Since 1985, a painting has served as a backdrop for the head table. For the 2009 inaugural luncheon, the featured painting was Thomas Hill's 1865 View of the Yosemite Valley, a painting that commemorated Abraham Lincoln's 1864 signing of the Yosemite Grant, which was the first time the federal government protected park lands for public use.|$|E
