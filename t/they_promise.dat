5|$|In {{the book}} and the lectures, Lewis argues that {{significant}} changes are required to meet the Millennium Development Goals in Africa by their 2015 deadline. Lewis explains the historical context of Africa since the 1980s, citing a succession of disastrous economic policies by international financial institutions that contributed to, rather than reduced, poverty. He connects the structural adjustment loans, with conditions of limited public spending on health and education infrastructure, to the uncontrolled spread of AIDS and subsequent food shortages as the disease infected much of the working-age population. Lewis also addresses such issues as discrimination against women and primary education for children. To help alleviate problems, he ends with potential solutions which mainly require increased funding by G8 countries to levels beyond what <b>they</b> <b>promise.</b>|$|E

25|$|Solar {{cells can}} be {{classified}} into first, second and third generation cells. The first generation cellsâalso called conventional, traditional or wafer-based cellsâare made of crystalline silicon, the commercially predominant PV technology, that includes materials such as polysilicon and monocrystalline silicon. Second generation cells are thin film solar cells, that include amorphous silicon, CdTe and CIGS cells and are commercially significant in utility-scale photovoltaic power stations, building integrated photovoltaics or in small stand-alone power system. The third generation of solar cells includes a number of thin-film technologies often described as emerging photovoltaicsâmost of them {{have not yet been}} commercially applied and are still in the research or development phase. Many use organic materials, often organometallic compounds as well as inorganic substances. Despite the fact that their efficiencies had been low and the stability of the absorber material was often too short for commercial applications, {{there is a lot of}} research invested into these technologies as <b>they</b> <b>promise</b> to achieve the goal of producing low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.|$|E

For instance, some theologians believe that the life and writings of Paul the Apostle, who {{is believed to have}} experienced significant suffering during his ministry, are particularly in conflict with prosperity theology. [...] Cathleen Falsani, religion writer in an opinion piece in the Washington Post, points to the conflict with basic Christian teachings [...] "Jesus was born poor, and he died poor.

500|$|Bribery {{of foreign}} public {{officials}} {{is a distinct}} crime under Section 6, {{in line with the}} OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. A person will be guilty of this offence if <b>they</b> <b>promise,</b> offer or give a financial or other advantage to a foreign public official, either directly or through a third party, where such an advantage is not legitimately due. A foreign public official is defined, under Section 6(4), as [...] " [...] an individual holding legislative, administrative or judicial posts or anyone carrying out a public function for a foreign country or the country's public agencies or an official or agent of a public international organisation". The inclusion of [...] "through a third party" [...] is intended to prevent the use of go-betweens to avoid committing a crime, although if the written law of the country of the foreign public official allows or requires the official to accept the advantage offered, no crime will be committed. Unlike with general bribery offences, there is no requirement to show that the public official acted improperly as a result; this is a distinction between the Act and the Anti-Bribery Convention. The offence under Section 6 only applies to the briber, and not to the official who receives or agrees to receive such a bribe.|$|E
