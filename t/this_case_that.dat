25|$|Doyle {{was also}} a fervent {{advocate}} of justice and personally investigated two closed cases, which led to two men being exonerated of the crimes of which they were accused. The first case, in 1906, involved a shy half-British, half-Indian lawyer named George Edalji who had allegedly penned threatening letters and mutilated animals in Great Wyrley. Police were set on Edalji's conviction, even though the mutilations continued after their suspect was jailed. Apart from helping George Edalji, Doyle's work helped establish a way to correct other miscarriages of justice, as it was partially {{as a result of}} <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> the Court of Criminal Appeal was established in 1907.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{developments}} {{after it}} issued its original report, NTSB issued a superseding accident report on March 18, 1992. In its superseding report, the NTSB {{determined that the}} probable cause of the accident was the sudden opening of the cargo door, which was attributed to improper wiring and deficiencies in the door's design. It appeared in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> a short circuit caused an uncommanded rotation of the latch cams, which forced the weak locking sectors to distort and allow the rotation, thus enabling the pressure differential and aerodynamic forces to blow the door off the fuselage, ripping away the hinge fixing structure, the cabin floor and side fuselage skin, causing the explosive decompression.|$|E
25|$|Although {{individual}} members of Congress {{have every right to}} express their views and the views of their constituents with respect to their religious beliefs and principles and their personal standards of who may marry whom, this court cannot conclude that Congress is entitled to solemnize such views in the laws of this nation in disregard of the views, legal status and living arrangements of a significant segment of our citizenry that includes the Debtors in this case. To do so violates the Debtors' right to equal protection of those laws embodied in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.

25|$|In {{the example}} above the atomic weight of carbon is given as 12.011, not 12. This is because {{naturally}} occurring carbon {{is a mixture}} of the isotopes 12C, 13C and 14C which have relative atomic masses of 12, 13 and 14 respectively. Moreover, the proportion of the isotopes varies between samples, so 12.011 is an average value. By contrast, there is less variation in naturally occurring hydrogen so the average atomic weight is known more precisely. The precision of the molecular mass is determined by precision of the least precise atomic mass value, in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> of carbon. In high-resolution mass spectrometry the isotopomers 12C1H4 and 13C1H4 are observed as distinct molecules, with molecular weights of 16 and 17, respectively. The intensity of the mass-spectrometry peaks is proportional to the isotopic abundances in the molecular species. 12C 2H 1H3 can also be observed with molecular weight of 17.|$|E
25|$|In Washington v. Harper, the {{individual}} protesting the involuntary medication was already incarcerated. The Court suggested in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> a competent person {{has the right}} to refuse if the medication is administered for other than treatment reasons to a person not dangerous or extremely ill, but it accepted the institution's procedures for making such treatment decisions. However, Riggins was not convicted {{at the time he was}} involuntarily medicated. In Riggins v. Nevada, the Court said that not only had the medication to be a medically appropriate means of attaining an important state objective such as competency, but the medication must be the least intrusive means of attaining the objective. However, although the treatment must be the least intrusive (for example, to allow {{the individual}} to retain a clear head to consult with his attorney as well as to avoid medication side effects), the court did not say that involuntary medication is never appropriate to achieve the state's goal.|$|E
25|$|There was a hard-fought 16-month {{legal battle}} in the House of Lords, then the highest court of the United Kingdom. Pinochet claimed {{immunity}} from prosecution as a former head of state under the State Immunity Act 1978. This was rejected, as the Lords decreed that some international crimes, such as torture, could not be protected by former head-of-state immunity. This judgement was set aside in a second, unprecedented case, {{on the basis that}} one of the judges involved was potentially biased due to his ties to Amnesty International, a human rights activist organization that had campaigned against Pinochet for decades and intervened in the case. A third case in March 1999 confirmed the original verdict, but the Lords held in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> Pinochet could only be prosecuted for crimes committed after 1988, the year during which the United Kingdom implemented legislation for the United Nations Convention Against Torture in the Criminal Justice Act 1988. This invalidated most, but not all, of the charges against him; but the outcome was that extradition could proceed.|$|E

25|$|Rapid venom {{evolution}} {{can also}} {{be explained by the}} arms race between venom targeted molecules in resistant predators, such as the opossum, and the snake venom that targets the molecules. Scientists performed experiments on the opossums and found that there were multiple trials that showed replacement to silent substitutions in the von Willebrand Factor (vWF) gene which encodes for a venom-targeted hemostatic blood protein. These substitutions are thought to weaken the connection between vWF and a toxic snake venom ligand (botrocetin) which changes the net charge and hydrophobicity. These results are significant to the venom evolution because it is the first citation of rapid evolution in a venom-targeted molecule. This shows that an evolutionary arms race may be occurring in terms of defensive purposes. Alternative hypotheses suggest that venom evolution is due to trophic adaption, whereas these scientist believe, in <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> <b>that</b> selection would occur on traits that help with prey survival in terms of venom evolution instead of predation success. Several other predators of the pit viper (mongooses and hedgehogs) show the same type of relationship between snakes, which helps to support the hypothesis that venom has a very strong defensive role along with a trophic role. Which in turn supports the idea that predation on the snakes can be the arms race that produces snake venom evolution.|$|E
500|$|Ever {{since the}} {{affirmation}} by Congress, in the Expatriation Act of 1868, that individuals had an inherent right to expatriation (giving up of citizenship), it {{has historically been}} accepted that certain actions could result in loss of citizenship. This possibility was noted by the Supreme Court in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, an 1898 case involving a man born in the United States to Chinese parents who were legally domiciled in the country. After ruling in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> Wong was born a U.S. citizen despite his Chinese ancestry, the Court went on to state that his birthright citizenship [...] " [...] not been lost or taken away by anything happening since his birth." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{final section}} of the {{judgment}} was on {{the legality of the}} Commissioner's 1971 ordinance.

While the latitude given to the Commissioner was wide, it [...] "may be a very large tapestry, but every tapestry has a border". The court found that in the 1971 ordinance, the Commissioner had exceeded his authority, and the ordinance was made ultra vires. Therefore, the ordinance was quashed.|$|E

500|$|Seungsahn also {{developed}} his own kōan study program {{for students of}} the Kwan Um School, known today as the [...] "Twelve Gates". These twelve kōans are a mixture of ancient cases and cases which he developed. Before receiving inka to teach (in Kwan Um, inka is not synonymous with Dharma transmission), students must complete the Twelve Gates, though often they will complete hundreds more. One of the more well known cases of the Twelve Gates is [...] "Dropping Ashes on the Buddha", the Sixth Gate, {{which is also the}} title of one of his books. In the book The Compass of Zen, this kong-an is transcribed as follows: [...] "Somebody comes to the Zen center smoking a cigarette. He blows smoke and drops ashes on the Buddha." [...] Seungsahn then poses the question, [...] "If you are standing there at that time, what can you do?" [...] Not included in this version of the kōan is the Kwan Um School of Zen's following side note on the case, [...] "ere {{is an important factor in}} <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> has apparently never been explicitly included in its print versions.

500|$|Even though How the García Girls Lost Their Accents {{was written}} in the United States, there are {{significant}} historical ties between the novel and the author’s country of origin. Alvarez wrote an essay entitled [...] "An American Childhood in the Dominican Republic", in which she reveals some information about her own life. This is evidence that it may have served {{as the basis for the}} novel. For example, she mentions that it was Mr. Victor, of the US embassy and a member of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who persuaded Carlos García to join the resistance against Trujillo, and later helped him in leaving the country, and obtaining a job with an international cardiovascular team. This is a parallel to the novel in which Carlos Garcia obtains work as a doctor in New York. Julia Alvarez emigrated to the United States at the age of 10 with her parents and three sisters as political refugees from the Dominican Republic. The novel is a variation of her real-life experiences, which have perhaps been slightly altered. The majority of her literature is constructed from multiple viewpoints and a strongly concealed political undercurrent is present in her literature. In <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> <b>that</b> undercurrent is her family fleeing the Trujillo revolution, something she did as a child. The novel encompasses the impact living under a regime can have on a family, and the way it shaped the four girls' upbringing. It is also an attempt to understand memory, the past, and a time before the sisters lost their innocence and accents.|$|E
