40|$|In {{analogy to}} spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>reference</b> <b>systems,</b> {{semantic}} reference {{systems have been}} proposed to support interoperation between information communities. Such reference systems provide the structure for specifying intended interpretations of communities ’ vocabularies and the functionality of translating expressions used by one community to those used by another. First attempts towards designing semantic reference systems have been made and few prototypical implementations examined the notion for information communities in the geospatial domain. In addition to ambiguous, general and open-textured expressions that are applied to define data models, many geospatial concepts are vague in nature and geospatial information relies on error-prone measurements. Not all these aspects have yet been considered in reference systems. The work {{presented in this paper}} analyses the requirements, which semantic reference systems need to meet, in order to account for the varying facets of uncertainty. The facets are categorised and taxonomically structured. Design requirements are derived for each category. Possibilities of satisfying these requirements are outlined. The analysis defines a basis for developing semantic reference systems, which account for uncertainties underlying geospatial information. 1...|$|E

Theories have been refined and new technologies have been developed and enhanced, which in turn have advanced our understanding of geodesy and our ability to make use of this information. Chapter Two of the Technical Aspects of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (TALOS) manual has recently been updated to capture the effects of these geodetic changes on LOS activities, which are summarised in this paper. Through the International Association of Geodesy, global scientific organisations have developed conventions for spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>reference</b> <b>systems</b> and realisations of these systems, as well as conventions for the use of geodetic technology and techniques. Improvements in space geodesy techniques, such as GPS, Very Long Baseline Interferometry, Satellite Laser Ranging, and several satellite gravity missions have fundamentally improved our understanding of geodetic reference surfaces such as the geoid and reference ellipsoid, spurring ever more accurate global horizontal and vertical geodetic datums, systems and frames. This paper will concentrate on the implications of these geodetic advances on maritime boundary delimitation. Of course, GPS and other forms of satellite-based positioning have also revolutionised positioning for terrestrial and bathymetric surveys, as well as for vessel navigation. The latter topic will be touched upon in this work, but will be the focus of another paper at this conference...|$|E
40|$|This study reconstructs {{the present}} <b>temporal</b> <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> of Early African American English (AAE) by {{investigating}} the linguistic factors conditioning several variables within {{the domain of}} present <b>temporal</b> <b>reference</b> in three varieties argued to be representative of Early AAE. The first half concerns the variable contraction and deletion of the copula, studies of which have used the following grammatical category to ascribe a creole origin to AAE, while downplaying the equally significant subject-type constraint. Arguing that both effects are epiphenomena of constraints dictated by prosodic structure, I show that {{the complexity of the}} phonological phrase constrains both contraction and deletion across all three varieties. Thus, the early African Americans exploited a possibility inherent in the English language once contraction developed. The second half concerns verbal predication in the present <b>temporal</b> <b>reference</b> domain, previous studies of which have focussed only on the opposition between bare verbs and verbs marked with [...] s, ignoring other morphosyntactic constructions. Expanding the analysis to the entire present <b>temporal</b> <b>reference</b> <b>system,</b> I demonstrate that different expressions of the present themselves convey different aspects: the previously-noted finding that [...] s marks habitual aspect is confirmed, but zero also marks aspect, that of duration. The progressive is used most often with nonstative verbs, to denote durative aspect, while its much rarer use with statives appears to reflect an older stage in its "grammaticization". Thus, these findings largely comply with the literature on the history and use of the progressive in English. This reconstruction not only serves as further evidence {{in the history of the}} development of AAVE, it also demonstrates the utility of variationist analysis in resolving issues of system membership and genetic affiliation. Combining variationist analysis with current advances in linguistic theory, it provides linguistically meaningful explanations of the observed variability and places it within the context of the development of the English language...|$|R

Location <b>referencing</b> <b>system</b> (LRS) data models vary across transportation agencies and often within organizations as well. This {{has resulted in}} failed attempts and abandoned efforts to interoperate business functions and / or integrate data. A number of transportation agencies, through recognition {{of the significance of}} spatially-referenced information to their operations, have identified the need for comprehensive management of location referencing. What is lacking is a clear set of functional requirements for a comprehensive location <b>referencing</b> <b>system.</b> Detailed functional requirements and a comprehensive data model are necessary so transportation agencies can implement improved transportation information systems and advanced GIS-T technology.

30|$|Finally, {{geographic}} information has three components: space, time and theme (or attribute). Though {{the interdependence of}} these three dimensions is acknowledged, the work has deliberately chosen {{to focus on the}} spatial and temporal dimension of geographic dimension. The main rationale for this is that space and time are more specific and well-understood case of the (more varied) attribute dimension. It appeared reasonable to start with these two to make the investigation more manageable, as theories pertaining to the thematic dimension have proven challenging to establish. For instance, though spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>reference</b> <b>systems</b> have been around (and used) for years, semantic reference systems suggested 15 years ago [89] are yet to be produced. The ideas proposed in this article {{can be used as a}} starting point for the formulation of a more general, receptor-based, theory of resolution which applies to all three dimensions of {{geographic information}}. Regarding thematic resolution, Veregin [90] suggested a distinction between two types: thematic resolution for quantitative data and thematic resolution for categorical data. The former refers to the degree to which small differences in the quantitative attribute can be discerned (e.g., 10.03 mA and 10.0251 mA 7 indicate two different thematic resolutions for an observation reporting about the amount of electric current in an electrical circuit); the latter denotes the fineness of category definition (e.g., a classification of entities as being either ‘anthropogenic’ or ‘natural’ as opposed to a classification of the same entities as belonging to the classes ‘Agriculture’, ‘Grass and Riparian and Dense Urban vegetation’ ‘Desert’ or ‘Urban’ 8). The best setting for reuse of the ideas presented in this work is a theory of thematic resolution of quantitative data. In particular, interesting questions to investigate are the extent to which a receptor-based approach is applicable to the thematic resolution of observations, and the interplay between the thematic resolution of an observation (say an image), and the discrimination of the sensor (e.g., satellite) which produced the observation. These questions have not been discussed in this work and could be taken up by future studies.|$|E

In particular, current medical imaging techniques (such as magnetic resonance imaging and helical CT) provide temporal sequences of morphological data and, thus, information about heart kinematical behavior.

In {{the first half of}} the study, the strongest linguistic constraints on the choice of bare verb forms match precisely those described for large-scale studies of spoken (diaspora) Early AAE: the bare form results from consonant cluster simplification in weak verbs, and from lexical preferences attested through the history of English in the case of strong verbs. Conditioning factors proposed to result from earlier creole influence on Early AAE (anteriority, remoteness, or clause type) did not play a significant role. The second half of the study concerns multiple verb forms, especially the present perfect, described by previous studies as marginal or non-existent in AAE. In contrast, present perfect forms in this corpus are frequent and favoured by all the English-derived conditioning factors tested in this study: ambiguity of temporal orientation and relation, recent or continuing events, negation, extended time adverbials, and since clauses, as well as by non-statives. This conditioning, especially taken in concert with the variability of bare verb forms, suggests that the present perfect has long been part of AAE, with its rarity in other corpora due to genre-based differences in the frequency of contexts requiring its use. The study provides new evidence in the history of the development of African American varieties of English, as well as demonstrating the utility of variationist analysis in resolving problems of linguistic system membership. Combining variationist and comparative analytical methods, it places AAE within the context of the development of the English language...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on two corpora of Black English. The first, the Samana English Corpus {{is a series of}} recorded conversations with very elderly residents of the Samana peninsula in the Dominican Republic. They are the descendants of American Ex-Slaves who immigrated there just after emancipation. The second, the Ex-Slave Recordings are interviews with American Ex-Slaves conducted in the 1930 's. These corpora represent two, of the very rare, oral data bases which can tell us what Black English was like at an earlier point in time. The focus of our investigation was the past <b>temporal</b> <b>reference</b> <b>system.</b> Here, variable marking patterns among tense/aspect morphemes suggest that there are underlying differences between white and black varieties of English. We considered every verbal structure used to mark past time. This encompasses a wide range of different morphological types [...] base forms, e. g. I walk, suffixal inflections, e. g. I walked, suppletive forms, e. g. I went, pre-verbal items such as auxiliaries, e. g. I used to walk, as well as auxiliary/inflection combinations, e. g. I have walked/I have gone/I was walking. Many of these are used interchangeably, possibly as alternative semantic categories. Each of these forms was examined quantitatively with respect to many contextual features and from all areas of the grammar [...] phonology, syntax, semantics and discourse. Our results suggest some general patterns to temporal structure and organization. For example, we found that the existence of a preceding verbal mark was significant to all the variables we examined. An overt mark or no mark at all, led to more of the same. Such a counter-functional effect, although unattested in any English variety, is distinctly unlike a Creole system where overt marking is said to lead to unmarked forms. We concluded that there is very little evidence that the variable past <b>temporal</b> <b>reference</b> verbal structures in Samana English or the Ex-Slave Recordings can be attributed to Creole-like temporal organization. To the question of whether they represent English processes [...] {{there is little evidence that}} they do not. It remains to be seen, however, whether these results will be confirmed or contrasted in other Creole and/or English varieties (either Black or white). (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|Different forms convey future <b>temporal</b> <b>reference</b> in Portuguese. The {{recognition}} of these forms is {{a starting point}} towards examining their actual usage in the language. Of four acknowledged future forms, only two, i. e. the periphrastic ir + infinitive and the present variants, are productively used in contemporary spoken Brazilian Portuguese. There was therefore a need for reconstructing the future <b>temporal</b> <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> of early Portuguese, in order {{to shed light on}} the development of these forms in the future sector. This study employs the methods of comparative and variationist linguistics in diachronic and synchronic data to analyse this development. These methods made it possible to identify the conditioning factors contributing to the selection of the variants in future contexts throughout the centuries and establish the direction of the linguistic evolution. The first analyses concern the use of the future variants in the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries. They reveal that three variants were productively used to express the future: the synthetic future, haver + infinitive and the present. The synthetic future, which is acknowledged as the default form by prescriptive literature, had the highest overall probability of occurrence at that time, and was mainly favoured by contingent events, stative verbs and affirmative statements. The second analyses concern the use of the variants in the nineteenth century: the synthetic future, haver + infinitive, the present and ir + infinitive. In that century, the synthetic future lost two of its favoured contexts, contingent events and affirmative utterances, to the present variant and ir + infinitive, respectively. That century witnessed the emergence of an adverbial specification pattern in Brazilian Portuguese that has also been observed in French. The last analyses are related {{to the use of the}} future variants in the twentieth century. The results for the written data reveal that (i) haver + infinitive moved away from the future sector; (ii) the synthetic future declined; and (iii) the use of ir + infinitive highly increased. In the spoken data, only contingency and adverbial specification retained the present variant in the language. Ir + infinitive has almost completed its process of grammaticalization. This research reveals that the future variants have been in variation for centuries in Portuguese, and have been involved in a complex process of incursion and withdrawal from the future context, which ultimately changed the representation of future <b>temporal</b> <b>reference</b> in contemporary Brazilian Portuguese. The variationist methodology makes it possible to ascertain that the difference in frequency of variant usage in the different centuries is correlated to their displacement of or expansion into specific linguistic contexts...|$|R
40|$|The English go future, a quintessential {{example of}} grammaticalization, has shown {{layering}} with will {{since at least}} 1490. To date, most synchronic evidence for this development comes from dialects where be going to represents a sizable proportion of the future <b>temporal</b> <b>reference</b> <b>system.</b> However, in the United Kingdom {{in the late twentieth}} century there were still dialects where be going to was only beginning to make inroads, representing a mere 10 – 15 per cent of future contexts. These varieties offer an effective view of the early stages of grammatical change. Statistical analysis of nearly 5, 000 variable contexts reveals that the use of be going to is increasing across generations, but at different rates, depending on location and orientation to mainstream norms. Major patterns of use mirror previous findings: be going to is favoured for subordinate clauses. However, other widely reported constraints conditioning be going to are radically different across age groups, exposing contrasts between incipient vs later stages of grammaticalization. In the most conservative dialects be going to is strongly correlated with negatives and questions especially in the first person singular. This suggests that these contexts may have been the ‘trigger’ environments for redistribution of meaning of the incoming grammatical form (Hopper & Traugott 1993 : 85). The fact that strong effects of negatives and questions endure in contemporary urban varieties (Torres-Cacoullos & Walker 2009) confirms that grammaticalization begins in very specific syntactic contexts, and impacts on the system for generations to come. In contrast, other reported constraints – resistance of be going to in the first person singular and extension to inanimates and far future readings – emerge across generations, suggesting they are later developments. Taken together, these findings demonstrate how synchronic dialects show us incremental steps in the grammaticalization process. Comparative sociolinguistic analysis thus offers insights into which patterns define the point of grammaticalization itself; which derive from systemic processes; which can be attributed to discourse routines and collocations; and how these factors converge in shaping the evolution of grammar...|$|R

The dynamic objects on site interact with each other and site surroundings in a complex spatial-temporal manner. It is critical to consider spatial-temporal relationships between site objects at the pre-construction planning phase, otherwise conflicts or improper layout may frequently occur on site and influence the success of a project. ^ Four dimensional (3 D+time) modeling technique has been proven to be useful and promising in pre-construction planning. It aims to augment and integrate traditional planning aids such as 2 D/ 3 D drawings and Critical Path Method (CPM) schedules. However, the current 4 D modeling methods take great effort to create the model that mainly serves as a post-planning review tool. They usually lack the capability to represent dynamic workspaces, conduct 4 D analyses, and automate or facilitate the automation of model creation tasks. This research aims at understanding the dynamic interaction between site objects by creating a Spatial Temporal Information Model (STIM) for construction planning with dynamic representation, analytical, and convenient modeling capabilities to address the above mentioned issues. Firstly, the newly created model employs a flexible workspace generating and adjustment method to represent the dynamic workspace for each activity, considering labor 2 ̆ 7 s comfortable working ranges and workspace evolution. Secondly, a 4 D construction topology framework is created to support 4 D construction topological analysis considering the dynamic workspaces. It includes a generic representation to describe 4 D topological relationships in general and a Topology Categorization Method (TCM) to facilitate 4 D topological analysis for specific planning tasks. Lastly, a Spatial <b>Temporal</b> <b>Referencing</b> <b>System</b> (STRS) is created to implement the construction 4 D topology framework and as a platform for inputting, indexing, and analyzing 4 D information. The inputting method of STRS, a Graphical Planning Method (GPM), facilitates the 4 D modeling process that synergizes 4 D modeling into CPM scheduling and provides analytical assistance. The indexing method of STRS, an Octree-based Indexing Method (OIM), improves the efficiency of 4 D topological analysis. ^ A prototype of STIM is developed and validated based on a case study. The prototype is tested in its capability of 4 D modeling, dynamic workspace representation, and construction 4 D analyses. It is validated that STIM can be implemented and assist in construction planning tasks. The results demonstrated great potential of STIM to serve as an analytical 4 D model for construction planning. ^ This study brings contributions in three aspects: a) it better captures and represents the construction site dynamics; b) it enhances the analytical capability by supporting 4 D topological analysis; and c) it improves the 4 D modeling process. ...|$|R
