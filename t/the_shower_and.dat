She gives up her job, her current boyfriend and her apartment, and flies to Los Angeles to Jacob, who greets her with flowers {{at the airport}} where they have an awkward reunion. Jacob brings Anna to his house where he joins her in <b>the</b> <b>shower,</b> <b>and</b> as the water falls over them, they {{remember}} happier memories they had together {{at the beginning of}} their relationship, which has now become strained due to their indiscretions during the time spent apart.|$|E

Felicity is angry that Tony, a recovering alcoholic, got drunk again; she has had to issue several refunds because of his drunken behaviour on stage. She sends him into the shower to sober up, and summons Jim. He is unsure whether he knows the lines well enough to go onstage in Tony's place, but Laura encourages {{him to take the}} chance. As she hands him a prop dagger, he sees blood all over the dagger and her hands. Tony comes out of <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> wants to finish the performance, so Jim allows him to go. Laura berates Jim for his lack of ambition. She is left alone in the dressing room and hears noises coming from the shower; but when she goes to look, it is empty. A scream is then heard from the stage.|$|E

According to one, Polite {{checked into the}} hotel on August 1, but was dissatisfied and asked for another room. When she switched rooms and found the replacement did not have <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> bath she wanted, Polite asked for a refund, which she received. Afterward, however, she asked for return of a $1 tip ($ in 2014) that she gave to an elevator operator. The operator refused; Polite began to protest loudly, which {{caught the attention of}} Collins. According to another account, she became drunk at a party in one of the rooms, and confronted the officer as she attempted to leave.|$|E
5|$|Beth asks Mick to {{help her}} friend Morgan find her stolen cameras. When he meets her, Mick is {{completely}} shocked; Morgan is identical to his ex-wife, Coraline. He becomes even more confused when his vampiric sense of smell tells him that Morgan is human. Mick tries to expose Morgan as Coraline, but finally comes {{to believe that she}} is a doppelgänger when he sees that she does not have the fleur de lis tattoo on her shoulder as Coraline did. When alone, Morgan scrubs away the heavy makeup that has been covering the tattoo. Beth snoops through Mick's property, and finds out Mick was the one who protected her as a little girl when she was kidnapped. Morgan goes with Mick to his apartment to clean up after almost getting hit by a car. Mick joins her in <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> finally sees the tattoo on her shoulder, revealing her identity as Coraline. When Beth learns that Morgan is really Coraline, the lady who kidnapped her as a child, she goes to Mick's apartment and stabs her with a wooden stake, narrowly missing her heart, not realizing that she has become human. Coraline goes to hospital, but recovers and leaves after being revealed to be a vampire again. Beth's boyfriend Josh is kidnapped by a dangerous Los Angeles–based gang. Mick and Beth witness the event and drive after him, but Josh is shot. Beth realizes that Josh is dying, and begs Mick to turn him into a vampire; he refuses and Josh dies. While putting Josh's affairs in order, Beth discovers that Josh was about to propose to her.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} results of FLUKA {{simulations}} of the propagation of cosmogenic muons in a 20 kton spherical liquid scintillator detector underneath 700 to 900 meters of rock. A showering muon is one which deposits at least 3 GeV in the detector in addition to ionization energy. We find that 20 percent of muons are <b>showering</b> <b>and</b> a further 10 percent of muon events are muon bundles of which more than one muon enters the detector. In this range <b>the</b> <b>showering</b> <b>and</b> bundle fractions are robust against changes in the depth and topography, thus <b>the</b> total <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> bundle rate for a given experiment {{can be obtained by}} combining our results with an estimate for the total muon flux. One consequence is that a straightforward adaptation of <b>the</b> full detector <b>showering</b> muon cuts used by KamLAND to JUNO or RENO 50 would yield a nearly vanishing detector efficiency.

25|$|Darius Just had {{previously}} helped novice writer Giles Devore produce a breakthrough novel. Just credits himself with ruthlessly editing Devore's original drafts and forcing the young author to turn an incoherent mess into a masterwork. Having gained {{fame and fortune}} with his first book, a bestseller, Devore attends the ABA convention to promote his second book, which he wrote without Just's help. Just volunteers to run an errand for Devore – collecting a parcel for him and taking it to his hotel room – but he forgets to do so until the next day. Entering Devore's hotel room, Just discovers Devore dead in the bathroom, apparently having slipped in <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> hit {{his head on the}} faucets. Others take this to be a tragic accident and nothing more, but Just suspects murder, based on Devore's compulsive tidiness and the disarray in which Just found the room. He interviews Devore's ex-wife, who tells him that the parcel contained Devore's monogrammed pens.|$|E
500|$|Following the sacking of Roeder as Norwich {{manager in}} January 2009, Gunn {{was asked to}} take {{temporary}} charge of the first team. In an interview with BBC Radio Norfolk, he revealed that he [...] "told the players that they've let people down." [...] In his first match as caretaker manager, he received [...] "a euphoric reception" [...] from the fans, and Norwich beat Barnsley 4–0. The players were equally supportive: according to Scotland on Sunday, [...] "in the dressing room afterwards, [...] midfielder, Darel Russell, dragged the chairman, Roger Munby, into <b>the</b> <b>shower,</b> <b>and</b> demanded that Gunn be appointed permanently." [...] Momentum gathered, and a Facebook group called [...] "Bryan Gunn for manager", created by his then 17-year-old daughter, Melissa, soon attracted about 3,000 members. Gunn considered applying for the role on a longer-term basis; he had previously applied without success to be Norwich manager in 1998. On 19 January 2009 he phoned the directors and requested to be considered. He was interviewed that afternoon and [...] "by 10.30 am the next day had been appointed manager {{until the end of}} the season".|$|E

The girls are also shown in different locations with individual story lines. Cole is simply seen looking out of a sunny window. Walsh is {{sat in front of}} a mirror, putting on make-up; her fictional boyfriend comes to get her and they hug, though she appears to be sad. Coyle is seated on a couch, flipping through photographs featuring her and a man. She takes a lighter to the photos and sets them alight. Roberts is lying down by a swimming pool, running her fingers through the water. A young man walks up to her with a bouquet of flowers and tosses them into the water. Harding watches her boyfriend in <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> goes through his phone. The video premiered on 17 October 2007.|$|E
500|$|Nava praised Beyoncé's {{acting in}} the commercial, stating: [...] "She's so scorchingly hot that even when she touches the floor with her {{dangerous}} high-heels, she kind of sets her world on fire." [...] In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, Beyoncé described the sexual tone of the video stating: [...] "'It's called Heat, so we wanted the ads to be really steamy and dewy. My sexiest moments are when I'm just {{getting out of the}} tub or <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> I'm clean, so I wanted to incorporate that in the ads. The dress was this liquid-y satin. The song Fever I did years ago and always loved it. [...] I got to sing it a bit more whispery, more natural." [...] "Fever" [...] was re-recorded by Beyoncé on two different occasions. Knowles first recorded her version of [...] "Fever" [...] on September 9, 2003 for her film The Fighting Temptations. Before the release of Heat, she recorded [...] "Fever" [...] again for the fragrance's television commercial. After the launch of Heat, the latter version of the song was officially released as a promotional single to the US iTunes Store through Columbia Records on February 8, 2010, to promote the fragrance. It was made available digitally in the United Kingdom the following day.|$|E

After getting out of <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> having another argument with Vito, Regal ran off with his towel falling off, exposing his buttocks and, for a brief second, his penis. Although his buttocks being exposed was scripted, his penis was completely accidental. WWE issued an apology for the incident the next day, mentioning that it didn't tolerate nudity of any kind, in contrast to past instances of intentional nudity during The Attitude Era (particularly from the Divas and Billy Gunn during his [...] "Mr. Ass" [...] gimmick) as well as the then-current ECW segment Extreme Exposé. Because No Mercy was on pay-per-view, WWE didn't receive any repercussions by the FCC or cable television providers.|$|E

Bryan heard Rucker singing in <b>the</b> <b>shower,</b> <b>and</b> the two became a duo, playing R.E.M. covers at a local venue. They later recruited Felber and finally Sonefeld joined in 1989. As a member of Hootie & the Blowfish, Rucker has recorded six studio albums: Cracked Rear View – 1994, Fairweather Johnson – 1996, Musical Chairs – 1998, Scattered, Smothered & Covered – 2000, Hootie & the Blowfish [...] and Looking for Lucky – 2005, also charting within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 six times. All six albums feature songs that Rucker, Bryan and Felber wrote.
