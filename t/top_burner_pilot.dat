The developed model is more dependent on injection co-firing and combined with co-milling co-firing. Co-firing not only reduces CO 2 emission, but also does not significantly affect the fly ash use in cement industry, construction industry and agriculture. Moreover, economic assessments show that in comparison with dedicated firing in grate furnace, agro/forestry residues and coal co-firing in a large PC furnace is highly economic. Otherwise, when the co-firing ratio was below 5 wt%, the boiler co-firing efficiency was 0. 05 %– 0. 31 % higher than that of dedicated PC combustion, and boiler efficiencies were about 0. 2 % higher with agro/forestry residues co-firing in the bottom and <b>top</b> <b>burner</b> systems than that in a middle burner system...|$|R

The syngas was either co-fired with coal at the burners or injected downstream as a reburning fuel under both fuel lean and conventional (fuel rich) reburning configurations. Sensitivity of syngas heat input and furnace stoichiometry were examined. Results indicated that the syngas was an effective reburning fuel although it contained less than 6 % hydrocarbons. NOx reductions from 12 – 46 % were predicted for different reburning configurations; the highest NOx reduction of 46 % was achieved with 23 % heat input under a conventional reburning configuration. Furnace LOI increased over baseline values for all but one reburning configuration. The highest LOI came from the <b>top</b> <b>burner</b> row in all cases. Results suggested the LOI increase due to reburning might be mitigated by biasing more air to the upper burners to enhance particle burnout.

Since the unit currently fires a blend of high sulfur Illinois coal and low sulfur Kentucky coal to meet an SO{sub 2 } limit of 1. 8 lb/MBtu, the goal at this site was amended to meeting this limit while increasing the fraction of high sulfur coal to 57 % from the current 15 % level.

In this thesis, the use of iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO) 5) as a catalyst precursor in the combustion of natural gas is experimentally studied. The counter-flow diffusion flame burner is employed as the experimental apparatus. The products of combustion are analyzed by using a Gas Chromatograph (GC) to quantitate the effects of adding the catalyst. The experimental setup is such that a mixture of methane (CH 4) and nitrogen (N 2) is fed from the bottom burner while a mixture of oxygen (O 2) and air is supplied from the <b>top</b> <b>burner.</b> The combustion of natural gas without catalyst is first characterized.

To investigate and evaluate the performance of iron-containing catalysts on emission reduction, a small amount of separated nitrogen flow is used to carry iron pentacarbonyl into the flame through the central port of the fuel-side burner. Catalytic combustion produces an orange flame.

The furnace operates by allowing a short natural gas flame to burn over the face of a wall of porous fire brick on two sides of the furnace.

Regulators and orifice valves are used to provide a minimum gas pressure of 4 in. water column at a rate of approximately 1, 450 scf/h to the burners.

Observed flame length and vendor literature were used to calculate <b>pilot</b> <b>burner</b> gas consumption. Air for combustion, purging, and cooling is supplied by a single blower.

40|$|Plating of Neurospora conidia or ascospores {{is often}} {{accomplished}} using a glass spreader to distribute suspended cells on the agar surface. See How to plate conidia and ascospores. Spreaders are commonly made of 3 mm diameter soft glass rod with a 70 ° bend 50 mm {{from one end}} (Davis and de Serres 1970). These are sturdy and suitable for reuse. Common practice is to sterilize the spreader between using it for different spore samples by dipping it in alcohol and flaming to burn off the excess alcohol. This kills conidia. Ascospores, however, are large, thick-walled, and heat-resistant, and the procedure does not ensure that all ascospores adhering to the spreader will be killed (Newmeyer and Wallace 1971). It is imperative, therefore, that an already used spreader be replaced with a sterile spreader whenever ascospores from different crosses are to be plated one after another. Spreaders handmade from disposable Pasteur pipettes provide a convenient alternative to the conventional spreaders made of glass rod. Procedure Disposable Pasteur pipets 23 cm long are suitable. (VWR Scientific Catalog No. 14572 - 380. Flint glass. Outside dimension of body, 7 mm; OD of 12 cm-long capillary stem, ~ 1. 5 mm.) Pipets are sterilized in a hot-air oven.

There is no need to dip in alcohol or to flame before using. Each newly made spreader is discarded after use.
