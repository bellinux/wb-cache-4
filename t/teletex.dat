50|$|<b>Teletex</b> was an ITU-T {{specification}} for a {{text and}} document communications service {{that could be}} provided over telephone lines. <b>Teletex</b> allowed for the transmission and routing of Group 4 facsimile documents. It was rapidly superseded by e-mail but the name <b>Teletex</b> lives on {{in several of the}} X.500 standard attributes used in Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.|$|E
50|$|<b>Teletex</b> was {{designed}} as an upgrade to the conventional telex service. The terminal-to-terminal communication service of telex would be turned into an office-to-office document transmission system by <b>teletex.</b> <b>Teletex</b> envisaged direct communication between electronic typewriters, word processors and personal computers. These units had storage for transmitting and receiving messages. The use of such equipment considerably enhanced the character set available for document preparation.|$|E

5000|$|A background/foreground {{operation}} was envisaged in <b>teletex.</b> Transmission/reception of messages should proceed {{in the background}} without affecting the work which the user might be carrying out in the foreground with the equipment. In other words, a user might be preparing a new document, while another document was being transmitted or received. The <b>teletex</b> would also maintain compatibility with the present telex system and inter-operate with it. Telex procedures called for the exchange of header information before the actual document transfer took place. The header information consisted of four parts: ...|$|E

Plain MO-MT messages have PID=0.|$|E
50|$|The {{draft of}} the second {{standard}} {{was based on the}} consideration of factors such as the promulgation of the jōyō kanji, the enforcement of the jinmeiyō kanji, and the standardization of Japanese-language <b>Teletex</b> by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications; also, the next modification was performed to keep pace with JIS C 6234-1983 (24-pixel matrix printer character forms; presently JIS X 9052).|$|E
50|$|T.61 is an ITU-T {{recommendation}} for a <b>Teletex</b> character set. T.61 predated Unicode,and {{was the primary}} character set in ASN.1 used in early versions of X.500 and X.509for encoding strings containing characters used in Western European languages. While T.61 continues to be supported in modern versions of X.500 and X.509, it has been deprecated in favor of Unicode. It is also called Code page 1036, CP1036, or IBM 01036.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the standard character set, a rich set of graphic symbols and a comprehensive set of control characters were supported in <b>teletex.</b> The set of control characters helped in preparation and reproduction of documents. In particular, they permitted the positioning of the printing element, specification of page orientation, left and right margins, vertical spacing {{and the use of}} underlining. The page control feature allowed standard A4 size papers to be used for receiving messages instead of the continuous stationery used in conventional telex systems.|$|E
5000|$|Unified messaging: GeoNet {{was one of}} {{the first}} systems to offer [...] "unified messaging" [...] (a term {{introduced}} by Ovum Ltd. in the UK). The [...] "one-stop-shop" [...] metaphor was extended by allowing message exchange with fax, telex, <b>teletex,</b> SMS, pager, voice and Inmarsat-C. GeoNet {{was one of the}} first systems to introduce a fax-out service, and also one of the first systems to offer private fax-in numbers, allowing users to send and receive faxes from wherever they could get a connection to their mailbox.|$|E

Thanks to a chance meeting with the manager of <b>Teletex</b> International computer systems at a party, Victoria is able to access the most advanced computer system in the state which informs her that she can counter the aging with pituitary gland extract from a 5 to 6 month old human fetus. In addition, Martha has grown jealous of Victoria's success, and finds out the University of Colorado has never heard of her. Before she leaves for Minneapolis, Victoria poisons her with methotrexate {{in order to keep}} her origin secret. Shortly after Martha's departure, Holliston is informed of her fatal heart attack.|$|E
50|$|The Teleputer was a {{range of}} {{computers}} that were suffixed with a number. Only the Teleputer 1 and Teleputer 3 were manufactured and sold. The teleputer 1 was a very simple device and only worked as a <b>teletex</b> terminal, whereas the Teleputer 3 was a z80 based micro computer. It ran {{with a pair of}} single sided 5¼ inch floppy disk drive; a 20Mb Hard disk drive version was available {{towards the end of the}} product's life. The operating system was CP/M or a proprietary variant CP*, and the unit was supplied with a suite of applications, consisting of a word processor, spreadsheet, database and a semi-compiled basic programming language. The display supplied with the unit (both the Teleputer 1 and 3) was a modified Rediffusion 14 inch portable colour television, with the tuner circuitry removed and being driven by a RGB input. The unit had a 64Kb onboard memory which could be expanded to 128Kb with a plug in card. Graphics were the standard videotext (or teletext) resolution and colour, but a high resolution graphic card was also available. A 75/1200 baud modem was fitted as standard (could also run at 300/300 and 1200/1200), and connected to the telephone via an old style round telephone connector. In addition an IEEE interface card could be fitted. On the back of the unit there was a RS232 and Centronic connections and on the front was the connector for the keyboard.|$|E
40|$|<b>Teletex,</b> a {{computerized}} {{version of the}} classic switched telegraph system, was marketed by the PTTs as the 'natural' successor to the obsolete telex system. It was a failure. <b>Teletex</b> {{is likely to be}} dropped within the foreseeable future. Telex is also showing a significant decline, which will eventually mean the end of the classic switched telegraph. <b>Teletex</b> was unable to revive the principles of the switched telegraph. The future of text communication centres around two other means of telecommunication: telefax and e-mail. The battle over text communications and the life cycle of <b>teletex</b> is studied in terms of externalities and {{within the framework of the}} installed base theory. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>TELETEX</b> {{is a new}} {{international}} telecommunication service for text communication between terminals capable of data storage and possibly integrated in a information processing system, [l]. The new service is intended to fill the same needs as does business mail. With regard to information security {{this means that the}} information handled by the <b>TELETEX</b> system shall not be unintentionally changed or destroyed or lost to an unintended receiver. Measures to prevent this are called information protection. (We prefer to use the terms information security and information protection rather than data security and data protection. The reason is that "data " {{in the sense of a}} string of symbol s may be lost without revealing the information represented by the data. This is for example the case when the data consists of encrypted information). One of the most efficient methods for information protection is to use encryption. This means that the information is transmitted using a ''language" which i s not understood by is efficiently protected against loss and in most cases also against undetected change. Cryptological methods can also be used to detect information destruction. In Section 2 of this report we discuss the basic problems involved with the use of encryption in data networks in general. In a separate report we discuss the possible threats to the information security in <b>TELETEX.</b> This leads to suggestions regarding suitable protection methods. Our standpoint is that <b>TELETEX</b> shall offer at least the same level of information security as does the established mail distribution system...|$|E

40|$|Through {{much of the}} 1980 s, {{governments and}} {{corporations}} invested {{hundreds of millions of}} hours and dollars developing three technologies now generally considered extinct: <b>teletex,</b> videotext and Minitel. The technologies which now define the history of the Internet were relatively ignored, though known to exist as obscure academic experiments. Most curiously, BBSes and Fidonet – popular technologies which defined the digital world for millions –were, and remain, largely ignored by scholars.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{two major}} questions. First, {{what is the}} schizophrenia that is afflicting the library profession in general and public librarians in particular? Second, what knowledge and skill competencies must public librarians possess {{to survive in the}} remainder of this century, particularly in utilizing information technology? In the latter part of this paper I will suggest six competency areas that should be emphasized both for public librarians and all professional librarians. Most public librarians have difficulty thinking of libraries as just one type of information technology. The general public thinks of public libraries primarily as a collection of books or a room or building where a collection of books, periodicals, manuscripts, or even possibly video-cassettes are kept. Clearly, to meet their needs, people go to many other information resources than just the public library. Today, the emergence of videotex, <b>teletex,</b> autodial tape services, electronic banking services, electronic publishing, laser printing on demand, and many other technol-ogies are expanding the information user's options...|$|E
40|$|Historical {{examples}} (ISDN, <b>Teletex,</b> telefax, telex) {{show us that}} forecasting {{efforts in}} the telecommunication sector can go awry [...] not only by a few percentage points but by large magnitudes. We maintain that with strong network effects {{it is not possible}} to forecast the success of telecommunication services with a high degree of confidence. This paper reviews the role played by network effects for the adoption of telecommunication services, which lead to diffusion phenomena including critical mass, lock-in, path dependency, and inefficiency. To improve forecasting practices, we propose the master equation approach as an appropriate modelling technique incorporating network effects. A case is made for "thinking in probability distributions" rather than deriving misleading linear extrapolations of trend patterns. At base, the paper argues why these phenomena require a shift, away from a static, to a dynamic analysis; the paper also identifies a formal method suitable for the dynamic analysis. 2000 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a batch service polling {{system in which}} all customers in a queue present upon arrival of the server a,re served simultaneously. The service time is independent of the batch size. We study the joint steady-state queue. iength distribution {{as well as the}} waiting time distribution at each of the queues. 1. fntroduction We consider poliing systems where service is given in batches of unlimited size. When the server visits a queue, all customers present are served in a single batch. We call tlis gated batch seruice. The batch service time is independent {{of the size of the}} batch. Some examples of such systems are discussed in the literature below. Examples more related to manufacturing are ovens, transportation of material by one server to a number of different machines and, a,s an approximation, situations in which the set-up time is an order of magnitude larger than the actual production time. Literature reu'iew Polling systems with unlimited batch service have been studied much less extensively then those in which service is given to customers in a 'one at a time ' fashion or in batches of limited size. Unlimited batch service models are considered in the context of teletext, videotex and TDMA systerrs, as well as for central data-base operations.
