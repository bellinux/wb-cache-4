You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E
2500|$|According to Pirozhkova, [...] "Before I met Babel, I {{used to read}} a great deal, though {{without any}} {{particular}} direction. I read whatever I could get my hands on. Babel noticed this and told me, 'Reading that way will get you nowhere. You won't have time to read the books that are truly worthwhile. There are about a hundred books that every educated person needs to read. Sometime I'll try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> list of them.' And {{a few days later}} he brought me a list. There were ancient writers on it, Greek and Roman — Homer, Herodotus, Lucretius, Suetonius — and also all the classics of later European literature, starting with Erasmus, Rabelais, Cervantes, Swift, and Coster, and going on to 19th century writers such as Stendhal, Mérimée, and Flaubert." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{his last}} days, {{some of his}} new disciples began to preach him as God Almighty. I was afraid my meeting with such men would give rise to {{unpleasant}} discussions. So, I kept away. At last, when the news of his fast declining health was brought to me one day, I left all work and went to Dakshineswar. I found him very low. That was before his removal to a more commodious house on the riverside for treatment. Ramkrishna took me to task for neglecting him. I pleaded guilty to the charge and made a clean breast of it by letting him know the exact causes, I smiled and said, “As there are many editions of a book so {{there have been many}} editions of God Almighty and your disciples are about <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> new one.” He too smiled and said, “Just fancy, God Almighty dying of cancer in the throat. What great fools these fellows must be!” ...|$|E

2500|$|The group started 2000 {{by playing}} its second Big Day Out tour. It {{continued}} touring internationally playing the US, Canada and New Zealand. Daymon recalled [...] "There have been times, especially after Someday Shambles, when our popularity in Australia had really surprised {{us and we}} were playing to huge crowds at the Big Day Out and we'd had two really successful records. We were a little dismayed as to why we couldn't push it further into the overseas area. Unfortunately {{it seemed to be}} the politics of working with a record on a major label that held us back. It's not much of an incentive for a label overseas <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> priority if a lot of the profit is going back to the company where the band is from". In August, the group issued a six-track split EP with Jimmy Eat World, Jebediah / Jimmy Eat World in the US through independent label, Big Wheel Recreation.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2017, {{during an}} {{interview}} with The Breakfast Club radio show, T.I. revealed he would retire from making music after three more solo albums: [...] "I'm ready {{to get the hell}} outta here, though. I got, like, two, I got, this next album and two, I got three more albums in my head, conceptualized. Once I get them out, I'm done. [...] We're still doing it. … [...] The next one is more like trap music. It’s Trap Muzik 2017. And the one after that, it’s gonna be more like a, uh, love as it pertains to a dope boy. And the one after that, that’s my final album. It’s called Kill the King. The last album is Kill the King. Simply because ever since my first album, I've put the title of 'King of the South' on me and to make yourself the king is <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> target. And in chess, the object is to kill the king. So Kill the King is the title of my last album. Will they kill him or will he ride into the sunset happily ever after?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But Mr. Grandcourt will {{consider}} {{that you have}} already accepted him, in allowing him to come. His note tells you plainly enough that he is coming <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> offer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{impossible}} for me <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> offer," [...] she said, [...] "for this reason--your need of money will depend greatly on your future plans. I am quite ignorant of your future plans.'' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Young {{women are}} severe: they don't feel {{the stress of}} action as men do, though perhaps I ought <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> {{exception}} there. But you don't put Fred Vincy on so low a level as that?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But what," [...] said Mr. Jaggers, {{swinging}} his purse,--"what {{if it was}} in my instructions <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> present, as compensation?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{wanted to}} explain to {{you one of the}} reasons which emboldened me last night <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> {{proposal}} of marriage.|$|E
6000|$|... "We can {{understand}} that," [...] the professor agreed. [...] "We are approaching you {{with regard to}} them in an altogether different manner. Mr. Bomford {{is a man of}} business. It is our wish <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> offer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But if {{you knew}} it, I am endeavouring to save you. Imprudent as you have been I still wish <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> my wife." [...] Here Rachel in her indignation spat upon the floor. [...] "Yes; I am anxious <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> honest woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sixth. God {{can tell}} {{how to fight}} against thee [...] "with the sword of his mouth," [...] and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>thee</b> <b>a</b> butt for his arrows; {{and this is a}} {{dispensation}} most dreadful (Rev 2:16; Job 6:4; Psa 38:2-5).|$|R

6000|$|... "As yet, Luis," [...] {{returned}} the young wife, smiling, [...] "the change promiseth {{to be the}} other way, since thou art much likelier <b>to</b> <b>make</b> me a rover, than I <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>thee</b> <b>a</b> fixture of the castle of Llera." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One minute," [...] {{said the}} picture, evidently alarmed. [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> offer--a genuine offer. It's right what I'm saying. You lack inspirations. Well. No doubt you've {{heard of the}} Cathedral of Cologne, and the Devil's Bridge, and--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel--almost too much--to think," [...] he said, with {{a solemn}} simplicity. [...] "I {{have come to}} speak to you without preface. My life is not my own since I have beheld you clearly, Miss Everdene--I come <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> offer of marriage." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Then I won't; we {{must try}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> home here. And {{in the first}} place, those lodgings of yours; {{you can never be}} {{comfortable}} in them.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Try to talk {{sensible}} for once, Hudson," [...] he said. [...] "See here, I don't want to {{take advantage}} of your beastly temper, but if you are really bent on selling the place, and not vaporing as usual, I'm open <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> offer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it isn't," [...] {{he broke}} in. [...] "I am {{speaking}} {{of you and}} of me, and no one else.

6000|$|... "Edith," [...] said {{my mother}} sharply, when I got home that night, [...] "Harry has been here, and I know two things. He has {{proposed}} {{to you and you}} have refused him, I'm certain of that; and the other thing is, that young Carvalho has been insolent enough <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> offer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll try my best <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> good husband, Lucy,' said Bobbie, very earnestly. 'I don't {{ask you to}} {{care for}} me; I only want to serve you.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "By {{the chains}} of St. Peter," [...] quoth the monk, [...] "that {{is just what}} thou needest. Hoist thee on such another fool's back, truss thee up, and lay it on lustily, till thou art ashamed. To treat <b>thee</b> as <b>a</b> man is only <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>thee</b> <b>a</b> more heady blown-up ass than thou art already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Object--I? Ho--no! Not at all." [...] After a pause he said, [...] "But you won't {{have enough}} money for this lively scheme without help, you know?

6000|$|... “I am {{sure you}} will not find living with Daniel Hawkins agreeable,” he said. “So I am going <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> offer.
