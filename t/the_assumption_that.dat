5|$|The {{best fit}} for the shape of HAT-P-33b's orbit {{suggests}} that the orbit is slightly elliptical, as the planet's orbital eccentricity is fit to 0.148. However, because the star HAT-P-33 has such {{a high level of}} jitter, it is difficult to constrain the planet's eccentricity with accuracy. Most of the planet's defined characteristics are based on <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> HAT-P-33b has an elliptical orbit, although the planet's discoverers have also derived HAT-P-33b's characteristics on <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> the planet has a circular orbit. The elliptical model has been chosen because it is considered to be the most likely scenario.|$|E

5|$|A common {{source of}} data for {{archaeoastronomy}} {{is the study of}} alignments. This is based on <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> the axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards an astronomical target. Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while Green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments are unlikely to be selected by chance, usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites.|$|E
5|$|Chrysler Corporation {{approved}} {{the development of}} the model on <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> Chrysler Europe would sell 60,000 C9 models per year, which translated into a projected 5percent share of the executive car market. This estimate seemed achievable because Chrysler had a 7percent market share in Europe overall. The projected sales would have covered the car's tooling costs, with the development costs accounted for separately, as part of an independent annual budget.|$|E
5|$|Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita {{school and}} Shankara's Advaita school are both nondualism Vedanta schools, both are premised on <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> all souls {{can hope for}} and achieve the state of blissful liberation; in contrast, Madhvacharya {{believed}} that some souls are eternally doomed and damned.|$|E

5|$|The Khap panchayat's {{ruling was}} based on <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> Manoj and Babli belonged to the Banwala gotra, a Jat community, and were {{therefore}} considered to be siblings despite not being directly related and any union between them would be invalid and incestuous. Nevertheless, the couple went ahead with their marriage, following which they were abducted and killed by Babli's relatives.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> John of Lydus' {{figure of}} 390,000 for the Diocletian's army {{refers to the}} {{beginning}} of that emperor's reign is dubious as it would seem more natural for the chronicler to report the army's peak strength under that emperor.|$|E
5|$|The {{overarching}} methodological {{principle of}} positivism is to conduct sociology in broadly {{the same manner}} as natural science. An emphasis on empiricism and the scientific method is sought to provide a tested foundation for sociological research based on <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge, and that such knowledge can only arrive by positive affirmation through scientific methodology.|$|E

5|$|The update rule is an {{injective}} function, that is, {{there are}} no two configurations that both map to the same common configuration. This condition is obviously implied by <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> the update rule is a bijection. In the other direction, the Garden of Eden theorem for cellular automata implies that every injective update rule is bijective.|$|E
5|$|As {{a strong}} acid, HCl {{has a large}} Ka. Theoretical {{attempts}} to assign a Ka to HCl have been made. When chloride salts such as NaCl are added to aqueous HCl, they have practically no effect on pH, indicating that Cl− is an exceedingly weak conjugate base and that HCl is fully dissociated in aqueous solution. For intermediate to concentrated solutions of hydrochloric acid, <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> H+ molarity (a unit of concentration) equals HCl molarity is excellent, agreeing to four significant digits.|$|E
5|$|At certain dates, food may be set {{out as a}} {{sacrifice}} to {{the spirits of the}} deceased or the gods, such as during the Qingming Festival. This may include slaughtered animals, such as pigs and ducks, or fruit. Another form of sacrifice involves the burning of Joss paper, or Hell Bank Notes, on <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> images thus consumed by the fire will reappear—not as a mere image, but as the actual item—in the spirit world, making them available for revered ancestors and departed loved ones. At other points, a vegan diet or full fast may be observed.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{original}} Doctor Who series reached its conclusion, some tentative plans {{had been made}} for a proposed 27th season under <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> it would maintain the then-current pattern of two four-part and two three-part stories. As noted in each entry, Big Finish Productions has produced audio adaptations of several scripts {{as part of their}} The Lost Stories releases. The safecracking companion introduced in Crime of the Century (see below), who was never named during the planning, has now been given a name, that of Raine Creevey, and she is portrayed by Beth Chalmers.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{activity}} occurs along a protein's active site. Traditional drug design methods involve tightly binding to {{this site}} and blocking its activity, under <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> the target protein exists in one rigid structure. However, this approach works for approximately only 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain allosteric sites which, when bound to by small molecules, can alter a protein's conformation and ultimately affect the protein's activity. These sites are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very computationally costly. In 2012, Folding@home and MSMs {{were used to}} identify allosteric sites in three medically relevant proteins: beta-lactamase, interleukin-2, and RNase H.|$|E

The ship was launched on 12 September 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 20 July 1875. Deutschland cost the German government 8,240,000gold marks. She was the last German capital ship built by a foreign shipbuilder.|$|E
