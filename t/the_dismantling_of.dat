5|$|Set against this, the purges of the Red Army leadership, {{in which}} Molotov participated, {{weakened}} the Soviet Union's defence capacity {{and contributed to}} the military disasters of 1941 and 1942, which were mostly caused by unreadiness for war. The purges also led to <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> privatised agriculture and its replacement by collectivised agriculture. This left a legacy of chronic agricultural inefficiencies and under-production which the Soviet regime never fully rectified.|$|E

5|$|The {{dispute between}} the {{counties}} was resolved {{once and for all}} in 1848 when the Windsor Improvement Act 1848 decreed <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> the Divided Bridge and the building of two new road bridges, Victoria Bridge slightly upstream, and Albert Bridge slightly downstream. Both new bridges opened in 1851. Once the Divided Bridge was demolished the old Windsor to Datchet road was rerouted over Victoria Bridge and the Berkshire side became part of the private grounds of Windsor Castle. This is the only case on the entire Thames where a main bridge crossing has completely disappeared.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the thirteenth}} century, the islands once ruled by Magnús and his fellow members of the Crovan dynasty before him, were {{incorporated}} into the Scottish realm. In 1293, the parliament of John, King of Scots (died 1314) established three new sheriffdoms within his kingdom. One of these three, the Sheriffdom of Skye, was granted to William I, Earl of Ross (died 1323). This sheriffdom included the seaboard north of Ardnamurchan (Wester Ross and Kintail), and the islands of Skye, Lewis, Uist, Barra, Eigg, and Rum. It is possible that parts of the sheriffdom may have been taken over earlier, sometime after <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles.|$|E

The resumption of international rugby in South Africa came after <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> the apartheid system, and was only done with permission of the African National Congress. With their return to test rugby, South Africa were selected to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup. After upsetting Australia in the opening match, South Africa continued to advance through the tournament until they met New Zealand in the final. After a tense final that went into extra time, South Africa emerged 15–12 winners, with then President Nelson Mandela, wearing a Springbok jersey, presenting the trophy to South Africa's captain, Francois Pienaar.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} speed <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> the third-class forts, the 22nd Army Corps issued General Order 89, which stated (in part) that {{the guns and}} {{ammunition}} removed from the dismantled forts {{should be kept in}} storage. Fort Corcoran was chosen as one of the storage locations and thus avoided the immediate demise of the other third-class fortifications. By the end of August 1865, however, with funds running low, and no further appropriations likely, more and more forts were designated as second- or third-class locations, and were dismantled and the land returned to its original owners. Fort Corcoran stored the cannon of the dismantled forts located south of the Potomac River.|$|E
5|$|The {{track was}} lifted in 1964, the {{contract}} for the work was awarded to The Demolition and Construction Co Ltd, of Croydon, Surrey.

5|$|After their {{original}} religious activities ceased, Egyptian temples suffered slow decay. Many were defaced by Christians trying {{to erase the}} remnants of ancient Egyptian religion. Some temple buildings, such as the mammisi at Dendera or the hypostyle hall at Philae, were adapted into churches or other types of buildings. Most commonly the sites were left disused, as at the Temple of Khnum at Elephantine, while locals carried off their stones to serve as material for new buildings. <b>The</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> temples for stone continued well into modern times. Limestone was especially useful {{as a source of}} lime, so temples built of limestone were almost all dismantled. Sandstone temples, found mostly in Upper Egypt, were more likely to survive. What humans left intact was still subject to natural weathering. Temples in desert areas could be partly covered by drifts of sand, while those near the Nile, particularly in Lower Egypt, were often buried under layers of river-borne silt. Thus, some major temple sites like Memphis were reduced to ruin, while many temples far from the Nile and centers of population remained mostly intact. With understanding of the hieroglyphic script lost, the information about Egyptian culture that was preserved in the surviving temples lay incomprehensible to the world.|$|E
5|$|Although {{his primary}} reason for {{military}} action in Zaire was <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> the refugee camps, Kagame also began planning a war to remove long-time dictator President Mobutu Sese Seko from power. Mobutu had supported the genocidaires based in the camps, and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire. Together with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Kagame supported the newly created Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL), an alliance of four rebel groups headed by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, which began waging the First Congo War. The ADFL, helped by Rwandan and Ugandan troops, took control of North and South Kivu provinces in November 1996 and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting. By May 1997, they controlled almost the whole of Zaire except for the capital Kinshasa; Mobutu fled and the ADFL took the capital without fighting. The country was renamed as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Kabila became the new president. The Rwandan Defence Forces and the ADFL were accused of carrying out mass atrocities during the First Congo War, {{with as many as}} 222,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees declared missing.|$|E
5|$|Edward IV {{seized power}} in 1461. When Edward {{captured}} Henry's wife, Margaret of Anjou, {{she was brought}} back to be detained at the castle. Edward began to revive the Order of the Garter, and held a particularly lavish feast in 1472. Edward began {{the construction of the}} present St. George's Chapel in 1475, resulting in <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> several of the older buildings in the Lower Ward. By building the grand chapel Edward was seeking to show that his new dynasty were the permanent rulers of England, and may also have been attempting to deliberately rival the similar chapel that Henry VI had ordered to be constructed at nearby Eton College. Richard III made only a brief use of Windsor Castle before his defeat at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, but had the body of Henry VI moved from Chertsey Abbey in Surrey to the castle to allow it to be visited by pilgrims more easily.|$|E

5|$|Following {{through on}} the CEO's opinion that the company needed a {{consistent}} marketing plan and management team to succeed, the company began its moves by replacing its chairman and CEO Jerry W. Levin with its own choice of executives, Barry J. Gibbons, {{chairman and managing director}} of Grand Metropolitan Retailing, Ltd., as chief executive and Ian A. Martin, Grand Met's top executive in the United States, as chairman. The moves came to no surprise to Wall Street analysts and franchisees, as they were expected due to reservations about Levin after his appointment by the outgoing management at Pillsbury. Grand Met's first major restructuring move was <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> Burger Kings 50-year-old purchasing and distribution arm, Distron. Unhappy with the distribution group, the company originally thought to dispose of the division after the purchase but instead decided to reorganize it into two separate groups, one for procurement (Burger King Purchasing or BKP) and another for distribution (Burger King Distribution Services or BKDS). With the restructuring, the company eliminated many positions and ended up laying off over a hundred staff members as a consequence.|$|E
5|$|Poland's {{communist}} government attempted {{to destroy the}} union by instituting martial law in 1981, followed by several years of political repression, {{but in the end}} was forced into negotiation. The Roundtable Talks {{between the government and the}} Solidarity-led opposition resulted in semi-free elections in 1989. By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed, and, in December 1990, Wałęsa was elected president. This was soon followed by <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> the {{communist government}}al system and by Poland's transformation into a modern democratic state. Solidarity's early survival represented a break in the hard-line stance of the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR), and was an unprecedented event; not only for the People's Republic of Poland—a satellite of the USSR ruled by a one-party communist regime—but for the whole of the Eastern bloc. Solidarity's example led to the spread of anti-communist ideas and movements throughout the Eastern Bloc, weakening communist governments. This process later culminated in the Revolutions of 1989.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish conquest had as its {{principal}} aims the physical {{incorporation of the}} indigenous peoples of Chiapas into the Spanish Empire, and their spiritual conversion to Christianity. This involved <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> indigenous power structures, the destruction of pagan temples and idols, the concentration of indigenous populations in centralised settlements that could be more easily controlled and evangelised, the incorporation of these new settlements into the Spanish system of tributes and taxes, {{and the introduction of}} Christian imagery. One side of this involved armed struggle and the imposition of Spanish colonial administration by force; the religious side of this struggle was the generally peaceful conversion of indigenous populations to Christianity. In Chiapas, such evangelisation efforts were generally carried out by the Dominican Order. The Dominicans became involved in the concentration of Indians into new settlements, the construction of churches and convents, and the religious instruction of the natives.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrest of}} Zabiuddin Ansari alias Abu Hamza in June 2012 {{provided}} further clarity {{on how the}} plot was hatched. According to Abu Hamza, the attacks were previously scheduled for 2006, using Indian youth for the job. However, a huge cache of AK-47's and RDX, which were {{to be used for}} the attacks, was recovered from Aurangabad in 2006, thus leading to <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> the original plot. Subsequently, Abu Hamza fled to Pakistan and along with Lashkar commanders, scouted for Pakistani youth to be used for the attacks. In September 2007, 10 people were selected for the mission. In September 2008, these people tried sailing to Mumbai from Karachi, but couldn't complete their mission due to choppy waters. These men made a second attempt in November 2008, and successfully managed to execute the final attacks. David Headley's disclosures, that three Pakistani army officers were associated with the planning and execution of the attack were substantiated by Ansari's revelations during his interrogation.|$|E
5|$|The {{current line}} scheme of the R1 started {{operating}} on , after <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> the former {{route of the}} Barcelona–Mataró–Maçanet-Massanes railway through the Barcelona neighborhood of Poblenou. Earlier, all the commuter rail services coming from Mataró used the route through Poblenou, terminating at Estació de les Rodalies, a terminus station that was located adjacent to the still existing Estació de França. All services coming from Mataró were then rerouted through the Sagrera rail complex and the Meridiana Tunnel to access Barcelona, terminating at L'Hospitalet de Llobregat or Barcelona–El Prat Airport stations, depending on the station of origin. The services coming from Mataró terminated at the airport, whilst the services coming from north of Mataró terminated at L'Hospitalet de Llobregat. Since the new through line scheme offered more stops within Barcelona and better connections with the city's metro system, the line's ridership doubled. Throughout 1989, this new line scheme was incorporated as part of line 1 of Rodalies Barcelona (predecessor of the R1), the Cercanías commuter rail system for the Barcelona area, created in the same year.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{origins of}} the early Finnish horse are {{currently}} not known. Because the Finnhorse breed and its progenitors were the only horses in Finland for centuries, the history of horses in Finland parallels {{the history of the}} Finnhorse itself. The documented history of the distinct breed begins {{at the turn of the}} 13thcentury. Outside influences by many light and warmblood breeds were recorded beginning in the 16thcentury, making the breed larger and more usable. An official Finnhorse studbook was founded in 1907, producing purebred animals in significant numbers for many years. Due to mechanisation of agriculture and <b>the</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> Finnish horse cavalry in the later half of the 20thcentury, the Finnhorse population plummeted from a high of just over 400,000 animals in the 1950s to a low of 14,100 in 1987. However, the breed managed to survive thanks to its popularity for harness racing and its versatility as a mount.|$|E
