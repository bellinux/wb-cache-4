40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 22 nd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 14 - 16 July 2003 "National issues affecting the movement of people and goods - strategic approaches", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT: This study investigated taxi-owners. perceptions of the Government’s Recapitalisation Scheme for the taxi industry. More specifically, the objectives were to assess how it would impact on the taxi industry. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to gather data from short distance taxi-owners under Umsunduzi one municipality in Pietermaritzburg. <b>The</b> <b>recapitalisation</b> <b>scheme</b> is a strategy which {{was developed by the}} government to deal with economic problems facing the taxi industry. The study findings show that taxi-owners in Pietermaritzburg support the proposed recapitalisation scheme. Most taxi-owners felt that the intervention of the government in he taxi industry is important. The taxi-owners knew what recapitalisation is about. Their understanding of the scheme was that it was about the introduction of bigger vehicles. They further view the government’s objective behind the scheme as being taxing them. They identified that the benefit of the scheme for taxi-owners would be new vehicles. Most taxi-owners rated recapitalisation scheme as a good idea. Most taxi-owners felt that the problem with the proposed scheme was the lack of infrastructure (ranks) in place to cater for the proposed new vehicles. Under general comments, taxi-owners felt that the government is taking too long to implement the scheme. This paper was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference.

The salaries of senior bank executives will be frozen and they will not receive performance bonuses. However, it was found in 2013 that payrates at Irish banks increased between 2008 and 2012.

40|$|The {{economic}} and financial crisis of 2008 has raised some particularly challenging issues regarding assessing the performance of proposed financial institution bailout solutions. The need for quick action to avoid financial disaster often precluded a full airing of the possible advantages and disadvantages associated with the accountability and performance indicator mechanisms put in place. Now, a vigorous debate is occurring over performance indicators related to the effectiveness, efficiency and equity aspects of the solutions that have been implemented both in the U. S. and Europe. The United States major bailout proposal was the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) overseen by the Office of Financial Stability in the US Department of Treasury which has taken major ownership positions in US banks. The British bailout plan called <b>the</b> Bank <b>Recapitalisation</b> <b>Scheme</b> (BRS) is being directed by HM Treasury and the United Kingdom Financial institutions, Corp. which has also taken equity positions in major UK banks. These similarities and differences form the backdrop for the empirical case studies. The particular nature of these government programs make them ideal candidates for an extreme type case analysis in the characterizing the fight over defining performance. Not surprisingly, a host of academics, private financial institutions, government agencies and even intergovernmental governing bodies such as the IMF are airing their respective performance definitions. The competition between these bodies {{will serve as the}} empirical basis for assessing the arguments and motivations over how to define performance {{in the context of the}} bank bailouts. These case studies will be analyzed in the performance regime and competing values conceptual frameworks as initially brought together in Talbot (2008).. The performance regime frame will help assess the institutional forces who are attempting to exert influence over indicators. The competing values frame advances the notion that there are four major types of models by which social relationships are constructed and the form through the regime influences impact indicators and performance definitions. The major new contribution presented here will be in using these case studies to define the types of variables and factors that drive different types of private and public agents in constructing the definition of performance as well as advancing this combination of the performance regime and competing values framework. It is felt that these financial bailouts provide a rich set of data upon which new insights and the advancement of knowledge can be constructed. The United States and United Kingdom models represent important cases where large scale financial bailouts have occurred in two countries that have similar business cultures and yet there remain important differences in their approaches. ...|$|R

40|$|The European Commission {{published}} the Second Review report of Spain's {{compliance with the}} Financial Assistance Programme for <b>the</b> <b>Recapitalisation</b> of Financial Institutions.

Furthermore, as financial markets have stabilised, funding and liquidity conditions of the Spanish financial sector have improved. In order to build on this momentum, it will be important to maintain the pace of reforms in order to overcome the still significant challenges and conclude successfully the programme.

40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of the government’s formulation of <b>the</b> taxi <b>recapitalisation</b> policy which is aimed at regulating the minibus taxi industry. Coupled with a brief social and politico-historical context of the policy, the aim is to highlight the government’s statist conduct in the formulation of <b>the</b> <b>recapitalisation</b> policy. <b>The</b> minibus taxi industry started to fulfil a prominent role in the 1970 s {{as a result of a}} loophole in the legislation of the former apartheid government. It is currently the most accessible mode of public transport and conveys 65 per cent of the country’s commuters daily. Consequently, the Industry is an imperative force to be considered by the government in its formulation of transport policies. However, the industry is characterised by numerous problems, including a high rate of minibus taxis involved in accidents, unroadworthy vehicles and violence. It is in this context that the government formulated both the original and revised versions of <b>the</b> <b>recapitalisation</b> policy. However, <b>the</b> formulation of the policy has been problematic. The government followed a statist approach during the formulation process when it directed the course of the process according to its interests and without adequate consultation with relevant role players...|$|R

5000|$|... 16 Oct: Details for <b>the</b> bank <b>recapitalisation</b> {{outlined}} by <b>the</b> new memorandum was presented. The size of <b>the</b> <b>recapitalisation</b> {{is still a}} potential €48bn, of which the first €18bn were already injected into the four biggest banks {{in the first half}} of 2012. <b>The</b> remaining <b>recapitalisation</b> will be performed in three stages. At first the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) will immediately inject capital to the banks so they comply with the required 9% capital ratio. At the second stage HFSF shall provide financial tools until the end of January, and at the third stage the permanent capital increases should be covered by the private sector by the end of April 2013. Banks with remaining capital inadequacies shall before mid-June 2013 have a solution implemented. The 3 biggest systemic banks will get the remaining capital amounts covered by HFSF through the issue of common shares (where HFSF in return will pay the banks with EFSF bonds), while smaller banks will have to be either liquidated by HFSF or bought by other banks. The plan is for private shareholders to retain administrative control of the systemic banks, so during the next five years they will have the right at any time to buy back the shares from HFSF. Apparently the Troika have dropped their previous requirement for the capital ratios to be further increased to 10% by the end of June 2013.|$|R
