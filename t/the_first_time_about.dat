5|$|The {{chemistry}} of plutonium {{was found to}} resemble uranium {{after a few months}} of initial study. Early research was continued at the secret Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago. On August 20, 1942, a trace quantity of this element was isolated and measured for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>About</b> 50micrograms of plutonium-239 combined with uranium and fission products was produced and only about 1microgram was isolated. This procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element's atomic weight. On December 2, 1942, on a racket court under the west grandstand at the University of Chicago's Stagg Field, researchers headed by Enrico Fermi achieved the first self-sustaining chain reaction in a graphite and uranium pile known as CP-1. Using theoretical information garnered from the operation of CP-1, DuPont constructed an air-cooled experimental production reactor, known as X-10, and a pilot chemical separation facility at Oak Ridge. The separation facility, using methods developed by Glenn T. Seaborg and a team of researchers at the Met Lab, removed plutonium from uranium irradiated in the X-10 reactor. Information from CP-1 was also useful to Met Lab scientists designing the water-cooled plutonium production reactors for Hanford. Construction at the site began in mid-1943.|$|E

Bill Belichick spoke with Moss for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> the possibility of joining the Patriots at 2:30am Sunday morning. Moss then boarded a plane and arrived in Boston later that morning on April 29 and was required to pass a team administered physical. Once he was cleared by Patriots officials, a trade was completed that sent Randy Moss to New England in exchange for a fourth-round selection in the 2007 NFL Draft. The draft pick had been acquired by the Patriots the previous day from the San Francisco 49ers, and the Raiders selected John Bowie.|$|E
25|$|They invented and {{developed}} arithmetic by using several different number systems including a mixed radix system with an alternating base 10 and base 6. This sexagesimal system became the standard number system in Sumer and Babylonia. They may have invented military formations and introduced the basic divisions between infantry, cavalry, and archers. They developed {{the first known}} codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records. The first true city-states arose in Sumer, roughly contemporaneously with similar entities in what are now Syria and Lebanon. Several centuries after the invention of cuneiform, the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to be applied for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>about</b> 2600 BC, to messages and mail delivery, history, legend, mathematics, astronomical records, and other pursuits. Conjointly with the spread of writing, the first formal schools were established, usually {{under the auspices of}} a city-state's primary temple.|$|E

500|$|Immediately {{after the}} game, Lord Harris led his men from Sydney, {{cancelling}} the planned return match against a representative Australian side {{that would have}} become the fourth-ever Test match. The England team returned to Melbourne where two further matches were played against Victoria on 21–25 February and 7–10 March. At the farewell banquet hosted by the Melbourne Cricket Club, Harris spoke publicly for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> the riot. He was critical of the way his team had been treated by {{a portion of the}} New South Wales press, which had [...] "unintentionally", he trusted, [...] "but with questionable courtesy", described them [...] "as if they were strolling actors, rather than as a party of gentlemen." [...] However, the speech was otherwise regarded as reconciliatory.|$|E
500|$|Favre spoke {{publicly}} for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> his potential comeback in a July 14, 2008, interview with Greta Van Susteren on the Fox News Channel's On the Record with Greta Van Susteren. In the interview, Favre {{said he was}} [...] "guilty of retiring early", that he was [...] "never fully committed" [...] to retirement, {{and that he was}} pressured by the Packers to make a decision before the NFL Draft and the start of the free agent signing period. Favre disputed the notion that {{he does not want to}} play for Green Bay and said that while he understands the organization has decided to move on, they should now allow him to do the same. He made clear that he would not return to the Packers as a backup and reiterated his desire to be released rather than traded, which would allow him the freedom to play for a competitive team. Favre also accused the Packers of being dishonest, wishing the team would have been straightforward with him and the public.|$|E
500|$|A test in a {{deliberately}} artificial environment explored P. labiata′s {{ability to}} solve a novel problem by trial and error. A little island {{was set up in}} the middle of a miniature atoll, and the space between with them was filled with water. The gap was too wide for the spiders to jump all the way, and the spiders' options were to leap and then swim or to swim only. The testers encouraged some specimens by using a small scoop to make waves toward the atoll when the spiders chose the option the testers preferred (leap and then swim for some spiders, and swim only for others), and discouraged some specimens by making waves back toward the island when the spiders chose the option the testers did not want – in other words, the testers [...] "rewarded" [...] one group for [...] "successful" [...] behaviour and [...] "penalised" [...] the other group for [...] "unwanted" [...] behaviour. Specimens from Sagada almost always repeated the first option they tried, even when that was unsuccessful. When specimens from Los Baños were unsuccessful <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>about</b> three quarters switched to the other option, irrespective of whether the first attempt was by leaping and then swimming or by swimming only.|$|E

500|$|Populations from Los Baños {{and from}} Sagada, {{both in the}} Philippines, have {{slightly}} different hunting tactics. In laboratory tests, Los Baños P. labiatas rely more on trial and error than Sagada P. labiatas in finding ways to vibrate the prey's web and thus lure or distract the prey. Around Los Baños the web-building [...] Scytodes pallida, which preys on jumping spiders, is very abundant, and spits a sticky gum on prey and potential threats. A P. labiata from Los Baños instinctively detours round the back of S. pallida while with plucking the web {{in a way that}} makes the prey believe the threat is in front of it. In areas where S. pallida is absent, the local members of P. labiata do not use this combination of deception and detouring for a stab in the back. In a test to explore P. labiata′s ability to solve a novel problem, a miniature lagoon was set up, and the spiders had to find the best way to cross it. Specimens from Sagada, in the mountains, almost always repeated the first option they tried, even when that was unsuccessful. When specimens from Los Baños, beside a lake, were unsuccessful <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>about</b> three quarters switched to another option.|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, John's wife Cynthia {{opened the door}} of Kenwood (their home in Weybridge) to see a man who [...] "looked like a tramp" [...] but, alarmingly, with John's face. Cynthia invited Alf in, and gave him tea and cheese on toast until John came home, which he was {{expected}} to do in an hour or so. While waiting, Cynthia offered to cut Alf's [...] "long, stringy locks" [...] of hair, which he allowed her to do. After waiting for a couple of hours, Alf left. John was annoyed when he came home, and told Cynthia (for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time)</b> <b>about</b> Alf's visit to the NEMS office a few weeks earlier. Later he relented slightly and contacted Alf over the next few months, telling Cynthia [...] "Alright, Cyn. He's a bit 'wacky', like me." [...] After Christmas, in 1965, John was embarrassed to hear that Alf had made a record: [...] "That's My Life (My Love and My Home)", released on 31 December 1965. John asked Epstein to do anything he could to stop it being released or becoming a hit. The record never made it into the charts. In 1966 [...] "Freddie Lennon" [...] (the name under which Alf recorded) tried again, and issued three singles with the group Loving Kind. These records did not sell well, either. Though the public at large quickly forgot these attempts to cash in on his son's success with the Beatles, the records do command fairly high prices among collectors of rare records, with [...] "That's My Life" [...] being worth over £50.|$|E
500|$|A tribute {{was held}} in Armstrong's honor on September 13 at Washington National Cathedral, whose Space Window depicts the Apollo 11 mission and holds a sliver of Moon rock amid its stained-glass panels. In {{attendance}} were Armstrong's Apollo 11 crewmates, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin; Eugene A. Cernan, the Apollo 17 mission commander and last man {{to walk on the}} Moon; and former Senator and astronaut John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth. In a eulogy, Charles Bolden said, [...] "Neil will always be remembered for taking humankind's first small step on a world beyond our own, but it was the courage, grace, and humility he displayed throughout this life that lifted him above the stars." [...] Eugene Cernan recalled Armstrong's low-fuel approach to the Moon: [...] "When the gauge says empty we all know there's a gallon or two left in the tank!" [...] Diana Krall sang the song [...] "Fly Me to the Moon". Michael Collins led prayers. Aldrin and Collins left immediately after the event. The Apollo 15 commander, David Scott, spoke to the press; he recalled the Gemini 8 mission with Armstrong when he spoke, possibly for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>about</b> an incident in which glue spilled on his harness and prevented it from locking correctly minutes before the hatch had to be sealed or the mission aborted. Armstrong then called on back-up pilot Pete Conrad to solve the problem, which he did, to continue the mission without stopping the countdown clock. [...] "That happened because Neil Armstrong was a team player, he always worked on behalf of the team." ...|$|E
