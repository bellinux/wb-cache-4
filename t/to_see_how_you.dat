60|$|HARRY. I say, Daisy, I wish you'd {{put on the}} dress. I'd love <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> look in it.|$|E
6000|$|... “We shall {{go back to}} America <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> get on,” {{her husband}} said; “and if you succeed {{it will be a}} great precedent.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What, {{you pull}} the cat's tail! Then I'll pull your nose, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> like it." [...] And give his nose a proper hard pinch.|$|E
6000|$|... "Much better, my good friend--much better," [...] was {{the cheerful}} answer; [...] "but do tell us (we are so glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you!)</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> came <b>to</b> {{surprise}} {{us all in}} this way?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But I {{have a right}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you!</b> <b>How</b> do <b>you</b> {{think there}} can be {{anything}} between us now?' Lizzy was silent. 'You are a smuggler,' he continued sadly.|$|R
6000|$|... "What! Is it you? Really, I did {{not expect}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> <b>How</b> did <b>you</b> manage to pass the guards I placed within the caves and passageways to prevent your coming here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, dear. You {{are weak}} from loss of blood, and quiet is necessary. Lie here a minute. I will fetch the leech in, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> are." ...|$|E
60|$|CANDIDA. That's very gallant; but I think I {{should like}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> do it first. (Turning to Morell.) James: you've not been looking after the house properly.|$|E
60|$|MAGGIE. She's very keen. Comtesse, I {{could come}} for a day by and by <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> are getting on. Yes--yes--certainly. [To JOHN] She says she'll be delighted.|$|E
60|$|It's {{singular}} {{that though}} I'm Scotch {{and you are}} English I should be able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> ridiculous <b>you</b> are, while you're quite blind to your own absurdity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet," [...] {{said the}} princess; [...] "I have <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> big <b>you</b> can make {{yourself}}, now I wish <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> little <b>you</b> can become. Let me see you change {{yourself into a}} mouse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Greenbrier Nye!" [...] he exclaimed, {{grasping}} {{the hand that}} had smitten him. [...] "My dear fellow! So glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you!</b> <b>How</b> did <b>you</b> come to--oh, to be sure--the inaugural ceremonies--I remember you joined the Rough Riders. You must come and have luncheon with me, of course." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the only}} chance. I came down to look up bearers, and rig {{up a couple of}} hammocks, as well as <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> are getting on." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jonson means, [...] "despite your lack of Greek and Latin I {{would not}} shrink from {{challenging}} the greatest Greek and Roman tragedians <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> bear comparison with themselves"? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Andrew grimly. [...] "I've a {{suspicion}} {{that you know}} as much about it as I do, though it's hard <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> came by the knowledge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you {{are doomed}} to die," [...] {{continued}} Adolay, when the boys' howling had subsided, [...] "and if you are to be tortured, we will all come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> brave <b>you</b> are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have {{observed}} that you joke with difficulty. It's singular that though I'm Scotch and you are English, I should be able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> ridiculous <b>you</b> are, while you're quite blind to your own absurdity.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear fellow,' said Traddles, {{rumpling}} {{his hair}} in his excitement, which was a most unnecessary operation, 'my dearest Copperfield, my long-lost and most welcome friend, how glad I am <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you!</b> <b>How</b> brown <b>you</b> are! <b>How</b> glad I am! Upon my life and honour, I never was so rejoiced, my beloved Copperfield, never!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a pity, now, {{that you}} should be so {{careless}} of me, when I was so thoughtful of you! I have come all this distance, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You seem to {{have been}} getting smarter since you came to Canada," [...] he said. [...] "Perhaps I'd better admit that I was anxious <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> were getting on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that is my}} denomination," [...] said Babbie, cheerfully. [...] "Some day, though, I am {{coming to}} hear you preach. I should like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> look in your gown." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} begun to stow it away yet," [...] Jack said. [...] "I was waiting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> much <b>you</b> had both got, and which berth {{you were going}} to choose, before I began to settle at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|The woman made {{a little}} grimace. [...] "The trek-ox is slow to {{understand}} and one teaches it with the stick. Sometimes {{the same thing is}} done with a man. It seems the Señorita does not wish <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> fast <b>you</b> could go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are going}} to the manor-house of Charles de la Noue at Sainte Marie," [...] said De Catinat, [...] "and we hope soon to be in a place of safety. But I grieve, sir, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> terribly <b>you</b> have been mishandled." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{can read}} it, for us?" [...] asked Mrs. Talbot. [...] "Shall we ask Master Heatherthwayte? he is a scholar, {{and he said}} he would look in <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> fared." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> {{looked in}} it, Jim? It looks first rate. I wish I {{was in one}} too, and was going with you, instead of {{sticking}} in Philpot Lane." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{thought we}} would come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> were getting on," [...] said Mrs. Halliday. [...] "It was an adventure; your new road is very bad and the car nearly upset." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, here's a game!' cried Sam. 'Only think o' {{my master}} havin' the {{pleasure}} o' meeting yourn upstairs, and me havin' the joy o' meetin' <b>you</b> down here. <b>How</b> are <b>you</b> gettin' on, {{and how is}} the chandlery bis'ness likely to do? Well, I am so glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> <b>How</b> happy <b>you</b> look. It's quite a treat <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you; ain't it, Mr. Muzzle?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, Christian. Lift up your spirits like a man! Susy, dear, you and I {{will have}} a jig--hey, my honey?--before 'tis quite too dark <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> well-favoured <b>you</b> be still, though so many summers have passed since your husband, {{a son of a}} witch, snapped you up from me." ...|$|R
50|$|Time Trial Mode {{is a test}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> long <b>you</b> {{can last}} on your {{favourite}} map, while the difficulty is gradually increased. You can choose {{from all of the}} maps you've already unlocked in Story Mode - as you progress through Story Mode new maps will unlock in Time Trial Mode.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, yes; but {{my father}} died a few days ago, and I had to come on, and being near I ran in <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> and the 'bugs' were getting on." ...|$|E
60|$|Alph. Mourn inward, brother; 'tis {{observed}} at court, Who weeps, and who wears black; and your return Will fix all eyes on every act of yours, <b>To</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> resent King Sancho's death.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> are. I'm all right. What {{sort of a}} day is it? You'll go riding, won't you? Give my love to the horses. Good-bye, Dad; just for now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, Roger," [...] Mistress Beggs went on, [...] "it is {{marvelous}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> fast <b>you</b> grow! Why, it {{is scarce}} six months since you sailed away, and you seem half a head taller {{than you were}} when you went! And so the Swan has returned safely, without damage or peril?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "To get away? But you sha'n't, man! I won't let you. I {{was just}} going <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> <b>How</b> long have <b>you</b> been there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. BRENNAN (quickly--in a voice {{meant to}} be kindly). Here we are, all of us, come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> <b>How</b> is it you're feelin' now, Eileen? ...|$|R
