But [...] states, [...] "pure olive oil beaten for the light," [...] but not [...] "pure olive oil beaten for meal-offerings," [...] {{to make clear that}} such purity was required only for the Menorah and not for meal-offerings.. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2003[...] The Mishnah taught that there were three harvests of olives, and each crop gave three kinds of oil (for a total of nine types of oil). The first crop of olives were picked {{from the top of the}} tree; they were pounded and put into a basket (Rabbi Judah said around the inside of the basket) to yield the first oil. The olives were then pressed beneath a beam (Rabbi Judah said with stones) to yield the second oil. The olives were then ground and pressed again to yield the third oil. Only the first oil was fit for the Menorah, while the second and third were for meal-offerings. The second crop is when the olives at roof-level were picked from the tree; they were pounded and put into the basket (Rabbi Judah said around the inside of the basket) to yield the first oil (of the second crop). The olives were then pressed with the beam (Rabbi Judah said with stones) to yield the second oil (of the second crop). The olives were then ground and pressed again to yield the third oil. Once again, with the second crop, only the first oil was fit for the Menorah, while the second and third were for meal-offerings. The <b>third</b> <b>crop</b> was when the last olives of the tree were packed in a vat until they became overripe. These olives were then taken up and dried on the roof and then pounded and put into the basket (Rabbi Judah said around the inside of the basket) to yield the first oil. The olives were next pressed with the beam (Rabbi Judah said with stones) to yield the second oil. And then they were ground and pressed again to yield the third oil. Once again, with the <b>third</b> <b>crop,</b> only the first oil was fit for the Menorah, while the second and third were for meal-offerings..|$|E

40|$|Adoption of reduced-tillage fallow {{systems in}} the western USA is limited by winter annual grass weeds such as downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.). Moldboard plowing is an {{effective}} means of controlling downy brome in winter wheat (Tritcum aestivum L.) –fallow systems. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the influence of plowing and secondary tillage operations, for the purpose of weed control, on soil quality attributes of a silt loam soil that had been cropped in a subtill or no-till (NT) winter wheat–fallow system for more than 20 yr. Compared with undisturbed NT, downy brome populations in plowed NT decreased 97 and 41 % in the first and <b>third</b> <b>crops</b> following tillage, respectively. Wheat yields in plowed NT treatments were 30 and 9 % greater in the first and <b>third</b> <b>crops</b> following tillage, respectively, compared with undisturbed NT. Soil quality indicators assessed were organic C (OC), total N, inorganic N, pH, electrical conductivity, bulk density, water infiltration rate, and pore-size distribution. Five years after tillage, soil OC decline in the 0 - to 7. 5 -cm depth was 20 % in plowed compared with undisturbed NT; however, OC increased 15 % in the 7. 5 - to 15 -cm depth and was not different in the 0 - to 30 -cm depth. Total soil N followed similar trends. Soil inorganic N in plowed NT decreased 37 %, and soil pH increased 9 %, compared with undisturbed NT, at the 0 - to 7. 5 -cm depth.

40|$|The Tasar silkworm, Antheraea mylitta Drury (Daba TV), is an {{important}} wild, sericigenous insect and is commercially exploited in the nine states of tropical India. It encounters the vagaries of nature, pests and predators resulting in low crop yield. Rearing being outdoors, there is no control over the natural vagaries leading to irregular hatching of eggs and prolonged larval period. Not only the climatic hazards, its indefinite period of diapause leading to erratic moth emergence followed by inadequate seed support and other grainage problems also lead to severe crop loss. In order to overcome these difficulties, the concept of indoor rearing has been adopted. In the present investigation, a comparative analysis of Juvenile hormone (control larval period) extracted from the haemolymph of outdoor and indoor reared fifth instar 10 th day larvae of tasar silkworm has been taken up.

50|$|In crystallization, a solid (usually impure) is {{dissolved}} in a solvent at high temperature, {{taking advantage of}} the fact that most solids are more soluble at higher temperatures. As the solution cools, the solubility of the solute in the solvent will gradually become smaller. The resultant solution is described as supersaturated, meaning that there is more solute dissolved in the solution than would be predicted by its solubility at that temperature. Crystallization can then be induced from this supersaturated solution and the resultant pure crystals removed by such methods as vacuum filtration and centrifugal separators. The remaining solution, once the crystals have been filtered out, is known as the mother liquor, and will contain a portion of the original solute (as predicted by its solubility at that temperature) as well as any impurities that were not filtered out. Second and <b>third</b> <b>crops</b> of crystals can then be harvested from the mother liquor.|$|R

In the <b>third</b> lettuce <b>crop</b> only, isolates IVT 1 and Contans formulated by Prophyta and isolate IVT as an oil-water formulation, all applied as spore suspensions, reduced disease at harvest compared with the untreated control. Recovery, viability and C. minitans infection of sclerotia buried during the 8 -week period prior to each of the three lettuce crops, and of sclerotia formed on the crop, were tested. Only the maizemeal-perlite inoculum (isolate Conio) reduced the recovery of sclerotia buried in soil for weeks between inoculum application and crop planting, reducing their viability and increasing infection by C. minitans. Eight weeks was' sufficient to enable C. minitans to infect sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum, and may account for disease control. After harvest of the second and <b>third</b> <b>crops,</b> maizemeal-perlite treatment (isolate Conio) reduced the number and viability of sclerotia recovered on the soil surface and increased infection by C. minitans compared with spore-suspension treatments.
