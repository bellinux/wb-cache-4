5|$|Capital {{within the}} EU may be {{transferred}} in any amount {{from one country}} to another. All intra-EU transfers in euro are treated as domestic transactions and bear the corresponding domestic transfer costs. This includes all member states of the EU, even <b>those</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> eurozone providing the transactions are carried out in euro. Credit/debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within the eurozone are also treated as domestic transactions; however paper-based payment orders, like cheques, have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based. The ECB has also set up a clearing system, TARGET, for large euro transactions.|$|E
5|$|In many bathhouses the {{customer}} has {{a choice between}} renting a room or a locker, often for fixed periods of up to 12 hours. A room typically consists of a locker and a single bed (though doubles are sometimes available) with a thin vinyl mat supported on a simple wooden box or frame, an arrangement that facilitates easy cleaning between patrons. In many bathhouses (particularly <b>those</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> United States), {{some or all of}} the rooms are freely available to all patrons.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Reformation brought {{about changes in}} the {{governance}} of the cathedrals as discussed below. Some existent buildings became cathedrals at this time. Several of the buildings were structurally damaged or left incomplete because of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, 1537–40. Many of the large abbey churches, particularly <b>those</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> towns, were robbed, burnt out and abandoned. The late 16th and early 17th centuries saw repairs to the fabric of many cathedrals and some new building and stained glass {{as well as many}} new fittings.|$|E

Peter Charanis, born {{on the island of}} Lemnos in 1908 and later became a professor of Byzantine history at Rutgers University, recounts that when the island was taken from the Ottomans by Greece in 1912, Greek soldiers were sent to each village and stationed themselves in the public squares. Some of the island children ran to see what Greek soldiers looked like. ‘‘What are you looking at?’’ one of the soldiers asked. ‘‘At Hellenes,’’ the children replied. ‘‘Are you not Hellenes yourselves?’’ the soldier retorted. ‘‘No, we are Romans,’’ the children replied.|$|E

25|$|Towards late 1994 and {{especially}} in 1995 there was a definite distinction between the reggae and ragga sounding jungle and the tracks with heavily edited breaks, such as the artists Remarc, DJ Dextrous and The Dream Team on Suburban Bass Records. Ironically, one compilation which brought the term to the wider awareness of <b>those</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> scene, 'Drum & Bass Selection vol 1' (1994), featured {{a large amount of}} ragga influenced tracks, and the first big track to use the term in its title (Remarc's 'Drum & Bass Wize', 1994) was also ragga-influenced.|$|E

25|$|Sources {{disagree}} {{as to who}} the Ngarrindjeri were. The missionary George Taplin chose it, spelling {{the term}} as Narrinyeri, as a generic ethnonym to designate a unified constellation several distinct tribes, and bearing the meaning of 'belonging to people', as opposed to 'kringgari (whites). Etymologically, it {{is thought to be}} an abbreviation of kornarinyeri ('belonging to men/human beings', formed narr (linguistically plain or intelligible) and inyeri, a suffix indicating belongingness. It implied that <b>those</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> group were not quite human. Other terms were available, for example, Kukabrak, but Taplin's authority popularized the other term.|$|E
25|$|According to Mahayana sutras, Gautama Buddha always {{maintained}} that lay persons {{were capable of}} great wisdom and of reaching enlightenment.

Accordingly, emphasis on lay persons, as well as Sangha members, practicing the Buddhist path of morality, meditation, and wisdom is present in all major Buddhist schools.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{municipality}} {{is covered in}} forest of one type or another, and these forests are its main natural resource.
