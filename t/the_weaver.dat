5|$|An aspect weaver is a metaprogramming utility for aspect-oriented {{languages}} {{designed to}} take instructions specified by aspects (isolated representations of a significant concepts in a program) and generate the final implementation code. <b>The</b> <b>weaver</b> integrates aspects into the locations specified by the software as a pre-compilation step. By merging aspects and classes (representations {{of the structure of}} entities in the program), <b>the</b> <b>weaver</b> generates a woven class.|$|E

5|$|Below Winsford, {{the course}} of the river has been altered several times, by the {{construction}} of cuts and locks, to enable small ships to trade on it. The river formerly joined the River Mersey at Weston Marsh, but since the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal, begun in 1887, it has flowed into the canal, from where surplus water enters the Mersey by <b>the</b> <b>Weaver</b> sluices, just upstream of the junction. The tidal river section below Frodsham has been bypassed by the Weston Canal since 1810, and is no longer navigable, as Frodsham Lock is derelict.|$|E
5|$|In 1720 {{the first}} Act of Parliament to {{authorise}} {{improvements to the}} river was obtained by three gentlemen of Cheshire. The act was dated 23 March 1720 and authorised work between Frodsham bridge and Winsford bridge. Rates for tolls were set, which were to be reduced by 20 per cent once the cost of construction had been met, and profits were then {{to be used to}} maintain bridges and highways within Cheshire. Each year the Justices of the Peace were to meet to decide which structures should benefit from this source of revenue. The Act included powers to improve the Witton Brook from <b>the</b> <b>Weaver</b> to Witton Bridge. Following a plea by the owner of brine workings near Middlewich, who felt they would be disadvantaged by the new navigation, a separate Act was obtained on 7 June 1721 to authorise improvements to the River Dane, but did not result in any work being undertaken.|$|E

5|$|Many {{traditional}} rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave kilims, {{are divided}} into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by <b>the</b> <b>weaver.</b> In kilims from Anatolia, the motifs used are themselves usually symmetrical. The general layout, too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating with rows of motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly laid out as a wallpaper with a wallpaper group such as pmm, while the border may be laid out as a frieze of frieze group pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.|$|E
5|$|Significant change {{occurred}} when the Manchester Ship Canal was opened in 1894. The tidal section of the river below Frodsham now flowed into the ship canal, rather than the River Mersey, and the exit lock from Weston Docks also joined the canal rather than the estuary. A new ship lock was constructed at Weston Marsh, which provided a more convenient route to the ship canal than the alternative route through Weston Point docks. The Weston Canal has been little used since. Although {{it is possible for}} pleasure craft to reach <b>the</b> <b>Weaver</b> from the Ship Canal, it is a commercial waterway, and most leisure users are dissuaded from doing so by the amount of paperwork and the requirements of the operating company.|$|E
5|$|The major {{trade was}} salt. The {{arrival of the}} Trent and Mersey Canal at Anderton in 1773 was {{detrimental}} to the salt trade at first, but ultimately beneficial, as salt was tipped down chutes from the canal into barges on the river navigation. Access to the river was improved in 1810 by the Weston Canal, which provided a link to Weston Point, where boats could reach the River Mersey at most states of the tide, as the water was deeper. The navigation was completely reconstructed between 1870 and 1900, with the original locks being replaced by five much larger locks, capable of handling 1000-tonne coasters. With {{the opening of the}} Manchester Ship Canal, a new lock was constructed at Weston Marsh, which gave direct access to the ship canal without having to pass through the docks at Weston Point. All water from the river entered the canal nearby, and any surplus was released into the Mersey through <b>the</b> <b>Weaver</b> sluices, which were located just upstream of the junction.|$|E

5|$|In 1771, {{the people}} of Chester, fearing that the {{construction}} of the Trent and Mersey Canal would divert trade away from their city to Liverpool, announced in the Press that they would be applying to build a canal between Middlewich, on the Trent and Mersey, and Chester. The city was at the time served by the River Dee, and the River Dee Company had recently spent £80,000 on improvements to the river, but they realised that without a connection to the growing canal network, there was little future for the river or the Port of Chester. The idea had first been raised three years earlier, when merchants suggested a line from the Trent and Mersey to near Runcorn. There were no objections from the Corporation of Liverpool, but the canal company was non-committal. By 1770, the plans were a little clearer, with a main line from Chester to Middlewich and a branch to Nantwich. Although the Corporation of Chester subscribed £100 towards the scheme, and the Societies and Clubs of Chester put up another £2,000, there was little enthusiasm for it. Neither <b>the</b> <b>Weaver</b> Navigation nor the Trent and Mersey were supportive, as both might have lost some trade if the canal were built, and when the Duke of Bridgewater was approached for support, he replied that provided the canal did not physically link with the Trent and Mersey at Middlewich, he would not oppose the plans. Despite attempts at flattery, the Duke would not alter his position, and so the Company promoting the bill in parliament began with a serious disadvantage.|$|E

25|$|Completion of the River Weaver Navigation in 1734 {{provided}} a navigable route for transporting salt from Winsford, through Northwich, to Frodsham, where <b>the</b> <b>Weaver</b> joins the River Mersey.

The opening of the Trent and Mersey Canal in 1777 {{provided a}} second route close to <b>the</b> <b>Weaver</b> Navigation for part of its length, but extended further south to the coal mining and pottery industries around Stoke-on-Trent.|$|E

25|$|To be an {{efficient}} manufacturing facility, a loomshop needed good daylight, controlled ventilation, un-obstructed space, provision for storage, heat, and access for goods and workers. Hand looms were manual, the artisan raised the heddles using foot levers, {{and threw the}} shuttle {{the width of the}} loom by hand, forward and back. The left hand was used to operate the batten that compressed the pick. Broader cloth could not be woven this way, so <b>the</b> <b>weaver</b> used a child to throw back the shuttle. John Kay's flying shuttle of 1733, removed the need for the child. <b>The</b> <b>weaver</b> jerked the two hammers or pickers with a picking stick held in the right hand. The pickers propelled the shuttle, and the left hand operated the batten.|$|E
