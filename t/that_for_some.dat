5|$|The {{appointment}} {{of the government}} of Ukraine was scheduled for the December 11, 2007. The session was opened late due to awaiting of the President of Ukraine who after arriving was giving the first word. At first there were 271 parliamentarians registered that morning with only Party of Regions and four people's deputies from the Communist Party being absent. During the voting for the appointment, however, the rest of the Communist Party and Lytvyn Bloc were absent together with Ivan Plyushch from Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc. Beside <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> reason the electronic counting system of the parliament seemed to malfunction and did not count votes of two parliamentarians showing only 225 approving votes.|$|E
5|$|The {{system had}} {{its origins in}} laws enacted before Confederation, but was {{primarily}} active from {{the passage of the}} Indian Act in 1876. An amendment to the Indian Act in 1884 made attendance at day schools, industrial schools, or residential schools compulsory for First Nations children. Due to the remote nature of many communities, school locations meant <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> families residential schools were the only way to comply. The schools were intentionally located at substantial distances from Indigenous communities to minimize contact between families and their children. Indian Commissioner Hayter Reed argued for schools at greater distances to reduce family visits, which he thought counteracted efforts to civilize Indigenous children. Parental visits were further restricted by the use of a pass system designed to confine Indigenous peoples to reserves. The last federally operated residential school closed in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The use of data loggers at {{sea that}} record {{ingestion}} of water against time (providing a likely time of feeding) suggests that albatrosses predominantly feed during the day. Analysis of the squid beaks regurgitated by albatrosses {{has shown that}} many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive, and include mid-water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatross, suggesting <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> species (like the wandering albatross), scavenged squid may be {{an important part of the}} diet. The source of these dead squid is a matter of debate; some certainly comes from squid fisheries, but in nature it primarily comes from the die-off that occurs after squid spawning and the vomit of squid-eating whales (sperm whales, pilot whales and southern bottlenose whales). The diet of other species, like the black-browed albatross or the grey-headed albatross, is rich with smaller species of squid that tend to sink after death, and scavenging is not assumed to play a large role in their diet. The waved albatross has been observed practising kleptoparasitism, harassing boobies to steal their food, making it the only member of its order to do so regularly.|$|E

25|$|A {{generalization}} {{of the concept}} of Pythagorean triples is the search for triples of positive integers a, b, and c, such <b>that</b> , <b>for</b> <b>some</b> n strictly greater than 2. Pierre de Fermat in 1637 claimed that no such triple exists, a claim that {{came to be known as}} Fermat's Last Theorem because it took longer than any other conjecture by Fermat to be proven or disproven.

25|$|In antiquity, penance {{had been}} a public ritual. Penitents were divided into a {{separate}} part of the church during liturgical worship, and they came to mass wearing sackcloth and ashes in {{a process known as}} exomologesis that often involved some form of general confession. There is evidence that this public penance was preceded by a private confession to a bishop or priest (sacerdos), and it seems <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> sins, private penance was allowed instead. Nonetheless, penance and reconciliation was prevailingly a public rite (sometimes unrepeatable), which included absolution at its conclusion.|$|E

25|$|Stilgoe wrote lyrics for Andrew Lloyd Webber's Starlight Express and {{collaborated with}} Charles Hart on {{the lyrics to}} The Phantom of the Opera.

25|$|Ten weeks later, a local woman {{turned in}} Froon's blue backpack, {{which she said}} she had found in a rice paddy by a {{riverbank}} near her village of Alto Romero, in the Bocas del Toro region; she said she was sure it had not been there the day before. The backpack contained two pairs of sunglasses, $83 in cash, Froon's passport, a water bottle, Froon's camera, two bras, and the women's phonesall packed, dry, and in good condition.

25|$|The {{conjecture}} is wrong; , {{who went}} back to the original Italian text, observed <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> triangles a larger area can be achieved by a greedy algorithm that inscribes a single circle of maximal radius within the triangle, inscribes a second circle within one of the three remaining corners of the triangle, the one with the smallest angle, and inscribes a third circle within the largest of the five remaining pieces. The difference in area for an equilateral triangle is small, just over 1%, but as Howard Eves pointed out in 1946, for an isosceles triangle with a very sharp apex, the optimal circles (stacked one atop each other above the base of the triangle) have nearly twice the area of the Malfatti circles.|$|E
