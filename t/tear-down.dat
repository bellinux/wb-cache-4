Jon Pareles and Jon Caramanica of The New York Times commented that [...] "Rihanna shares the mechanized, {{chattering}} beat of [...] "Raining Men" [...] with Nicki Minaj, singing and rapping about an endless supply of available men". Stacey Anderson of Spin commented that the song is {{the highlight of the}} album, calling it [...] "a gloriously eccentric collaboration with Nicki Minaj that entwines their minor-key hyperventilating, air sirens dissolving into mind-melting bass, and the scene-stealing Minaj's breathless contortion of the simple word 'really' into its own fully demented sideshow". BBC Music also commended Minaj's presence on the song, saying that [...] "Nicki Minaj makes for a superb partner in crime on Raining Men, her wild, kinetic flow complementing Rihanna’s steely delivery to wicked effect". Jim Farber for New York Daily News said that [...] "Rihanna pairs just as well with Nicki Minaj, on a complete <b>tear-down</b> on the old Weather Girls disco standard 'It's Raining Men.' Here it's not a gay song of lust but a statement of assurance that no man should incite too much worry, considering their sheer numbers". Chris Richards of The Washington Post said that [...] "Nicki Minaj, a quick-witted rapper able to assume the voices of a dozen characters in a single song, fails to impart any wisdom on her colleague with [...] "Raining Men". Emily Mackay of NME said that [...] "Raining Men" [...] is a bold collaboration between Rihanna and Minaj, which plays to both of their strengths in the [...] "hip-pop" [...] collaboration.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies teletraffic engineering {{of dynamic}} multicast connections. The traditional models in teletraffic engineering do not handle multicast connections properly, since in a dynamic multicast tree, users may join {{and leave the}} connection freely, and thus the multicast tree evolves in time. A model called multicast loss system {{is used to calculate}} blocking probabilities in a single link and in tree-type networks. In a single link case, the problem is a generalised Engset problem, and a method for calculating call blocking probabilities for users is presented. Application of the reduced load approximation for multicast connections is studied. Blocking probabilities in a cellular system are studied by means of simulation. The analysis is mainly concentrated on tree type networks, where convolution-truncation algorithms and simulation methods for solving the blocking probabilities exactly are derived. Both single layer and hierarchically coded streams are treated. The presented algorithms reduce significantly the computational complexity of the problem, compared to direct calculation from the system state space. An approximative method is given for background traffic. The simulation method presented is an application of the Inverse Convolution Monte-Carlo method, and it gives a considerable variance reduction, and thus allows simulation with smaller sample sizes than with traditional simulation methods. Signalling load for dynamic multicast connections in a node depends on the shape of the tree as well as the location of the node in the tree. This dissertation presents a method for calculating the portion of signalling load that is caused by call establishments and <b>tear-downs.</b> reviewe...|$|R

5000|$|An effects unit is {{also called}} an [...] "effect box", [...] "effects device", [...] "effects processor" [...] or simply [...] "effects".

A musician bringing many pedals to a live show or recording session often mounts the pedals on a guitar pedalboard, to reduce set-up and <b>tear-down</b> time and, for pedalboards with lids, protect the pedals during transportation.

50|$|SIP and H.323 are {{signaling}} protocols, while {{media gateway}} control protocols are device control protocols.

50|$|The {{connection}} termination phase uses a four-way handshake, {{with each}} side of the connection terminating independently. When an endpoint wishes to stop its half of the connection, it transmits a FIN packet, which the other end acknowledges with an ACK. Therefore, a typical <b>tear-down</b> requires a pair of FIN and ACK segments from each TCP endpoint. After the side that sent the first FIN has responded with the final ACK, it waits for a timeout before finally closing the connection, during which time the local port is unavailable for new connections; this prevents confusion due to delayed packets being delivered during subsequent connections.|$|E
50|$|A network {{implementing}} NCS {{is designed}} {{according to the}} media gateway control protocol architecture for interconnecting a packet network with the traditional {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN). This architecture physically decomposes the functionality of providing complete end-to-end multimedia telecommunication sessions into several discrete components, notably a media gateway (MG) located at the customer premises that performs the physical translation between analog voice or video streams to packetized digital data, and a media gateway controller (MGC) which is a centralized server that controls typically many media gateways and manages the complexity of call setup, resource negotiation, call routing, and <b>tear-down.</b> In addition, the architecture also uses signaling gateways to the traditional telecommunication channels, such as SS7-based networks.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{a slotted}} {{protocol}} {{can be either}} connectionless or connection-oriented. However, only the latter case represents a true alternative to IEEE 802.11p, by introducing the determinism which {{carrier sense multiple access}} with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) lacks. In vehicle networks the connection set-up phases of a telephone call (reservation request, confirmation, data exchange, <b>tear-down)</b> cannot be applied (it does not hold for broadcast communications, it is hampered by hidden stations, it is not manageable with heavy losses, mobility and varying channel conditions). For these reasons MS-Aloha is connection oriented and continuously refreshes each reservation simply by transmitting each period. MS-Aloha adopts a different approach and subtends the following hypotheses and rules which, basically, define all its main mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Factory {{objects are}} used in {{situations}} where getting hold of an object of a particular kind is a more complex process than simply creating a new object, notably if complex allocation or initialization is desired. Some of the processes required {{in the creation of}} an object include determining which object to create, managing the lifetime of the object, and managing specialized build-up and <b>tear-down</b> concerns of the object. The factory object might decide to create the object's class (if applicable) dynamically, return it from an object pool, do complex configuration on the object, or other things. Similarly, using this definition, a singleton implemented by the singleton pattern is a formal factory - it returns an object, but does not create new objects beyond the single instance.|$|E
50|$|Inband T1s {{are also}} capable of {{carrying}} CID and ANI information if they are configured by the carrier by sending DTMF *ANI*DNIS*. However, PRIs handle this more efficiently. While an inband T1 seemingly has a slight advantage due to 24 lines being available to make calls (as opposed to a PRI that has 23), each channel in an inband T1 must perform its own setup and <b>tear-down</b> of each call. A PRI uses the 24th channel as a data channel to perform all the overhead operations of the other 23 channels (including CID and ANI). Although an inband T1 has 24 channels, the 23 channel PRI can set up more calls faster due to the dedicated 24th signalling channel (D Channel).|$|E
