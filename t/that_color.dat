5|$|Green room. A room at {{a theater}} where actors rest when not onstage, or a {{room at a}} {{television}} studio where guests wait before going on-camera. It originated in the late 17th century from a room of <b>that</b> <b>color</b> at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London.|$|E
5|$|Only certain traits may be {{required}} to deceive predators; for example, tests on the sympatry/allopatry border (where the two are in the same area, and where they are not) of the mimic Lampropeltis elapsoides and the model Micrurus fulvius showed <b>that</b> <b>color</b> proportions in these snakes were important in deceiving predators, but that the order of the colored rings was not.|$|E
5|$|Robert Patrick Modell (Robert Wisden) {{walks through}} a supermarket, buying a large {{supply of energy}} drinks. Before he can leave, Modell is {{surrounded}} and arrested by FBI agents led by Frank Burst (Vic Polizos). While being escorted away in a police car, he repeatedly talks about the color cerulean blue. Modell's talking seemingly causes the driver to not see an approaching big rig of <b>that</b> <b>color,</b> causing a collision. Modell escapes after the driver unlocks his handcuffs before dying.|$|E
50|$|Primitivism may {{be either}} realist or antirealist, since primitivism simply claims <b>that</b> <b>colors</b> aren't {{reducible}} to anything else. Some primitivists further accept <b>that,</b> though <b>colors</b> are primitive properties, no real or nomologically possible objects have them. Insofar as we visually represent things as colored - on this view - we {{are victims of}} color illusions. For this reason primitivism <b>that</b> denies <b>that</b> <b>colors</b> are ever instantiated is called an error theory.|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} the breed were white or occasionally brown or black. Queen Victoria adopted a small red Pomeranian in 1888, which caused <b>that</b> <b>color</b> to become fashionable {{by the end of}} the 19th century. In modern times, the Pomeranian comes in the widest variety of colors of any dog breed, including white, black, brown, red, orange, cream, blue, sable, black and tan, brown and tan, spotted, brindle, plus combinations of those colors. The most common colors are orange, black or cream/white.|$|E
5|$|The ship crosses an ice {{barrier and}} arrives in open sea, {{close to the}} South Pole, albeit with a mild climate. Here the Jane Guy comes upon a mysterious island called Tsalal, {{inhabited}} by a tribe of black, apparently friendly natives led by a chief named Too-Wit. The color white is alien to the island's inhabitants and unnerves them, because nothing <b>that</b> <b>color</b> exists there. Even the natives' teeth are black. The island {{is also home to}} many undiscovered species of flora and fauna. Even its water is different from water elsewhere, being strangely thick and exhibiting multicolored veins.|$|E
5|$|In plant cells, vacuoles cover {{anywhere}} from 30% to 90% {{of the total}} cell volume. Most mature plant cells contain one large central vacuole encompassed by a membrane called the tonoplast. Vacuoles of plant cells act as storage compartments for the nutrients and waste of a cell. The solution that these molecules are stored in is called the cell sap. Pigments <b>that</b> <b>color</b> the cell are sometime located in the cell sap. Vacuoles can also {{increase the size of}} the cell, which elongates as water is added, and they control the turgor pressure (the osmotic pressure that keeps the cell wall from caving in). Like lysosomes of animal cells, vacuoles have an acidic pH and contain hydrolytic enzymes. The pH of vacuoles enables them to perform homeostatic procedures in the cell. For example, when the pH in the cells environment drops, the H+ ions surging into the cytosol can be transferred to a vacuole {{in order to keep the}} cytosol's pH constant.|$|E
50|$|In philosophy, {{there are}} several {{theories}} of color. <b>Color</b> realism holds <b>that</b> <b>colors</b> are physical properties <b>that</b> objects possess. <b>Color</b> fictionalism is an error theory that denies this, and colors are the sum in our mind.|$|R

25|$|Properties {{can only}} be {{developed}} once a player owns all the properties in <b>that</b> <b>color</b> group, and then must be developed equally. A house must be built on each property of <b>that</b> <b>color</b> before a second can be built. Each property within a group must be within one house level {{of all of the}} others within that group.|$|E
25|$|To form a {{color with}} RGB, three light beams (one red, one green, and one blue) must be {{superimposed}} (for example by emission {{from a black}} screen or by reflection from a white screen). Each of the three beams is called a component of <b>that</b> <b>color,</b> {{and each of them}} can have an arbitrary intensity, from fully off to fully on, in the mixture.|$|E
25|$|Ladd-Franklin {{concluded}} <b>that</b> <b>color</b> vision {{evolved in}} three stages: achromatic vision (black and white), blue-yellow sensitivity and red-green sensitivity. Since red-green sensitivity {{was the last}} to evolve it explains why many people suffer from red-green color blindness. The next one that affects a small population is blue-yellow color blindness. Since achromatic vision was the first to evolve it explains why {{the majority of the population}} are not affected by black-white color blindness.|$|E

25|$|Brodovitch was {{sensitive}} to the fact <b>that</b> <b>color</b> was relatively new in magazines, with laborious preparation and high costs. By using process or second color inventively, Brodovitch {{was able to give}} the magazine an added sense of currency and luxury. He applied color to his layouts expressively, often choosing to use colors bolder than might be seen in the real world. Even after full-color reproduction became standard practice, he still used broad swaths of single colors for bold emphasis.|$|E
25|$|Because demosaicing is not {{required}} for the Foveon X3 sensor to produce a full-color image, the color artifacts ("colored jaggies") associated with that process are not seen. The separate anti-aliasing filter commonly used to mitigate those artifacts in a Bayer sensor is {{not required}}. This is because little aliasing occurs when the photodiodes for each color, {{with the assistance of}} the microlenses, integrate the optical image over a region almost as big as the spacing of sensors for <b>that</b> <b>color.</b>|$|E
25|$|P. gibbosus has a sting that {{is painful}} and menacing enough to deter most {{potential}} predators. P. gibbosuss black and yellow coloring {{serves as a}} warning to other organisms, as <b>that</b> <b>color</b> pattern often indicates a dangerous species. Additionally, the burrowing behavior of P. gibbosus provides the species with a suitable hiding spot to avoid predators. Because the burrows are so far into the ground, usually around two feet, P. gibbosus is able to avoid predation by remaining in its burrow.|$|E

25|$|The {{first year}} the points {{classification}} was used, {{it had no}} jersey {{that was given to}} the leader of the classification. In the 1967 Giro d'Italia, the red jersey was added for the leader of the classification. However, in 1969 the red jersey was changed to a cyclamen (purple) colored jersey. It remained <b>that</b> <b>color</b> until 2010 when the organizers chose to change the jersey back to the color red; in a return to the original color scheme for the three minor classifications, which reflected the colors of the Italian flag.|$|E
25|$|The {{sculpture}} {{that made}} her significant {{to the development of}} Minimalism were aggressively plain and painted structures, often large. The recessional platform under her sculpture raised them just enough off the ground that they appeared to float on a thin line of shadow. The boundary between sculpture and ground, between gravity and verticality, was made illusory. This formal ambivalence is mirrored by her insistence <b>that</b> <b>color</b> itself, contained a psychological vibration which when purified, as it is on a work of art, isolates the event it refers to as a thing rather than a feeling. The event becomes a work of art, a visual sensation delivered by color.|$|E
25|$|Darden {{would use}} a number of terms that he himself devised to {{describe}} how a quote, image, sketch, et cetera might influence a project. He would use the term pre-texts to describe passages that in-form the initial portion of the design process, but simultaneously cloaks and conceals the real intention. Con-texts are the writings by Darden or the inspirational elements that condition the design {{and give it a}} sense of believability. Sub-text was the underlining story behind the project—in a sense, Darden's own personal life found in the project (e.g. Darden's letter to The Southern Quarterly on how he related Oxygen House with his leukemia). Finally, there are archi-texts, which are writings, thoughts, or ideas by Darden himself <b>that</b> <b>color</b> the project and give it sustenance.|$|E
40|$|In synesthesia, {{stimulation}} of one sensory modality {{leads to a}} percept in another nonstimulated modality, for example, graphemes trigger an additional color percept in grapheme-color synesthesia, which encompasses the variants letter-color and digit-color synesthesia. Until recently, {{it was assumed that}} synesthesia occurs strictly unidirectional: Although the perception of a letter induces a color percept in letter-color synesthetes, they typically do not report <b>that</b> <b>colors</b> trigger the percept of a letter. Recent data on number processing in synesthesia suggest, however, <b>that</b> <b>colors</b> can implicitly elicit numerical representations in digit-color synesthetes, thereby questioning unidirectional models of synesthesia. Using a word fragment completion paradigm in 10 letter-color synesthetes, we show {{here for the first time}} <b>that</b> <b>colors</b> can implicitly influence lexical search. Our data provide strong support for a bidirectional nature of grapheme-color synesthesia and, in general, may allude to the mechanisms of cross-modality interactions in the human brain...|$|R

25|$|Although all-electronic {{color was}} {{introduced}} in the U.S. in 1953, high prices and the scarcity of color programming greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 Tournament of Roses Parade) occurred on January 1, 1954, but during the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. It was not until the mid-1960s <b>that</b> <b>color</b> sets started selling in large numbers, {{due in part to the}} color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that fall. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later. In 1972, the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.|$|E
25|$|Properties {{can also}} be mortgaged, {{although}} all developments on a monopoly must be sold before any property of <b>that</b> <b>color</b> can be mortgaged or traded. The player receives money from the bank for each mortgaged property (half of the purchase price), which must be repaid with 10% interest to unmortgage. Houses and hotels can be sold back to the bank for half their purchase price. Players cannot collect rent on mortgaged properties and may not give improved property away to others; however, trading mortgaged properties is allowed. The player receiving the mortgaged property must immediately unmortgage it for the mortgage price plus 10%, or pay the bank just the 10% amount and keep the property mortgaged; if the player chooses the latter, they must still pay the 10% again if the property is later unmortgaged.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1915, she was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis and spent the following two years in sanatoria, where she decided to become a writer. It was discovered during that time, however, that she had bronchitis, not TB. In 1917, she began writing for the Fort Worth Critic, critiquing dramas and writing society gossip. In 1918, she wrote for the Rocky Mountain News in Denver, Colorado. In the same year, Katherine almost died in Denver during the 1918 flu pandemic. When she was discharged from the hospital months later, she was frail and completely bald. When her hair finally grew back, it was white and remained <b>that</b> <b>color</b> {{for the rest of her}} life. Her experience was reflected in her trilogy of short novels, Pale Horse, Pale Rider (1939), for which she received the first annual gold medal for literature in 1940 from the Society of Libraries of New York University.|$|E
