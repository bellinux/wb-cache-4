5|$|A {{project to}} improve the {{performance}} of <b>the</b> <b>J</b> 34 resulted in one Hunter being fitted with a Swedish-designed afterburner in 1958. While this significantly increased the engine's thrust, there was little improvement in overall performance, thus the project was shelved. The last of <b>the</b> <b>J</b> 34s was retired from service in 1969.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the Swedish Air Force saw {{the need for}} an {{interceptor}} that could reach enemy bombers at a higher altitude than <b>the</b> <b>J</b> 29 Tunnan that formed the backbone of the fighter force. A contract for 120 Hawker Hunter Mk 50s (equivalent to the Mk 4) was therefore signed on 29 June 1954 and the first aircraft was delivered on 26 August 1955. The model was designated J 34 and was assigned to the F 8 and F 18 wings that defended Stockholm. <b>The</b> <b>J</b> 34 was armed with four 30mm (1.18in) cannon and two Sidewinders. The Swedish Air Force's aerobatic team Acro Hunters used five J 34s during the late 1950s. <b>The</b> <b>J</b> 34s were gradually replaced by supersonic J 35 Draken and reassigned to less prominent air wings, F 9 in Gothenburg and F 10 in Ängelholm, during the 1960s.|$|E
40|$|The Escherichia coli Hsp 40 DnaJ {{uses its}} J-domain (Jd) to couple ATP {{hydrolysis}} and client protein capture in Hsp 70 DnaK. Fusion of <b>the</b> <b>Jd</b> to peptide p 5 (as in Jdp 5) dramatically increases the apparent affinity of the p 5 moiety for DnaK {{in the presence}} of ATP, and Jdp 5 stimulates ATP hydrolysis in DnaK by several orders of magnitude. NMR experiments with [15 N]Jdp 5 demonstrated that the peptide tethers <b>the</b> <b>Jd</b> to <b>the</b> ATPase domain. Thus, ATP hydrolysis and client protein binding in DnaK are coupled principally through the association of the client with DnaJ. Overexpression of a recombinant Jd was specifically toxic to cells that simultaneously expressed DnaK. No toxicity was observed when overexpressing Jdp 5 or mutant Jd or when co-overexpressing <b>the</b> <b>Jd</b> and <b>the</b> nucleotide exchange factor GrpE. The results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>Jd</b> shifts DnaK to a client-bound form by stimulating the DnaK ATPase but only when <b>the</b> <b>Jd</b> is brought to DnaK by a client-Hsp 40 complex...|$|R
