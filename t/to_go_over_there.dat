Konetzni testified {{during the}} inquiry that Waddle {{and his crew}} had rushed into Greenevilles final {{maneuvers}} without taking enough time {{to ensure that no}} other vessels were in the vicinity. [...] In a statement that was widely reported in the media, Konetzni looked at Waddle and said, [...] "I'd like <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> and punch him for not taking more time." ...|$|E

I wanted it to look as phony as possible, I wanted the clouds to go one direction, the {{mountains}} to go one direction, the horses <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> cause I want to show you that this is The Hunger Games. I want to show you that {{this is the type of}} imagery that's been presented to all of us. And the only difference is a black dude in the middle of it." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The Wayfarers", the first-part of the three-part 1964 season opener, {{producers}} shipped Ruth and {{her family}} off to Australia where Paul would teach agriculture. [...] Lassie was forced {{to remain in the}} States due to Australia's strict quarantine regulations and would become the companion animal of Corey Stuart, a forestry service worker. Lockhart commented, [...] "We were supposed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> so that Paul could show the Australians how to grow things. We hadn't had a successful bean crop in six seasons. What could they possibly learn from us?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Say, Sir Henry," [...] he complained, [...] "I don't quite {{understand}} this. Why, I'd only got <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Draconmeyer <b>there</b> and stand and {{talk for a}} moment, and he must have introduced me." ...|$|R

500|$|On June 13, 2017, Rodman {{returned}} to North Korea {{on what was}} initially described as a sports-related visit to the country. [...] "My purpose is <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> and try to see if I can keep bringing sports to North Korea," [...] Rodman said. He added that he hoped to accomplish [...] "something that's pretty positive." [...] During the visit, Rodman met with national Olympic athletes, male and female basketball players, viewed a men's basketball practice, and visited a state-run orphanage. Rodman {{was not able to}} meet with Kim Jong Un, but met instead with the nation's Minister of Sports and handed off several gifts for Kim Jong Un, including two signed basketball jerseys, two soap sets, and a copy of Donald Trump's 1987 book, [...] "". Other gifts believed to be intended for the leader's daughter, included a [...] "Where's Waldo?" [...] book and a jigsaw puzzle of a mermaid.|$|E
2500|$|Chess, {{which is}} a {{recognized}} sport of the International Olympic Committee, {{has a history of}} being linked to political issues. [...] This was particularly true of the 1972 World Championship match between the American Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union. The match took place during the Cold War and Henry Kissinger is believed to have told Fischer [...] "America wants you <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> to beat the Russians".|$|E

6000|$|... "Because they {{go round}} the 'arth, in this latitude. Now {{is the time}} to speak, Sir John. If we are bound to Leaphigh, we have the choice of three pretty desperate chances; <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> under, or <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> that <b>there</b> ice. If we are to put back, there is not a moment to lose, for it may be even now {{questioned}} whether the ship would claw off, as we are, with a sending sea, and this heavy norther." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is {{too hot for}} {{anything}} in Italy,' Mrs. Fortescue said; 'it was foolish of us trying it. Of course, we ought not <b>to</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> {{until the end of}} September, or else in May. May {{was out of the question}} because of the House. September was equally so, because of the shooting; so my husband paired till the end of the session, and we started early last month. We have been doing Florence and Bologna and Venice, and the places along to Milan, and then I struck. The heat was unbearable; so now we shall spend a fortnight in Switzerland before we go back. I suppose there are lots of people one knows at Lucerne?' ...|$|R

50|$|In each episode, {{two sets}} of neighbors redecorated one room in each other's home. Each two-person team had two (later, three) days, a budget of US$1,000, (later $2,000) and the {{services}} of a designer. Although the producers generally allowed the teams <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> budget slightly, <b>there</b> was one instance when a designer <b>went</b> $150 <b>over</b> budget and the producers forced her to return a rug she bought for the project she was working on.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's even lovelier inside {{than it was}} out," [...] I murmured. The {{red light}} poured itself along the age-polished dusky panels till the Tudor roses and lions of the gallery took colour and motion. An old eagle-topped convex mirror {{gathered}} the picture into its mysterious heart, distorting afresh the distorted shadows, and curving the gallery lines into the curves of a ship. The day was shutting down in half a gale as the fog turned to stringy scud. Through the uncurtained mullions of the broad window I could see valiant horsemen of the lawn rear and recover against the wind that taunted them with legions of dead leaves. [...] "Yes, it must be beautiful," [...] she said. [...] "Would you like <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> it? <b>There's</b> still light enough upstairs." ...|$|R
60|$|One of the Gauchos now told Mr. Hardy that he {{knew that}} at a short {{distance}} further to the west there was a spring of water much used by the Indians, and where {{he had no doubt}} they had halted {{on the night of the}} fire. Finding that it was not more than half an hour's ride, Mr. Hardy, after a brief consultation, determined <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> to water the horses and breakfast, before retracing their footsteps across the burned prairie.|$|E
60|$|THE {{doctor was}} an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got him up. I told him {{me and my brother}} was over on Spanish Island hunting {{yesterday}} afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and shot him in the leg, and we wanted him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> and fix it and not say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks.|$|E
60|$|But I {{did hear}} {{something}} that the histories didn't mention and don't know about. I heard Joan say that now that the garrisons on the other wide had been weakened to strengthen those on our side, the most effective point of operations had shifted to the south shore; so she meant <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> and storm the forts which held the bridge end, and that would open up communication with our own dominions and raise the siege. The generals began to balk, privately, right away, but they only baffled and delayed her, and that for only four days.|$|E
50|$|It seems, due to {{committing}} many extravagancies and lavish lifestyle, he {{went bankrupt}} and eventually became deranged. He then quit {{his family and}} <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Paris. <b>Over</b> <b>there,</b> he proposed {{a plan for the}} conquest of Judea with an aim of rebuilding Jerusalem. In 1694, he proclaimed himself as new messiah and king of the Jews. One of the hobby, on which he spent millions of amassed wealth was the return of the Jews to Palestine.|$|R
50|$|CALLER: I'm {{one of the}} {{few that}} joined the Army to serve my country, I'm proud to say, not for the money or {{anything}} like that. What I would like to retort to is that, what these people don't understand, is if we pull out of Iraq right now, which is not possible because of all the stuff that's <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> it would take us at least a year to pull everything back out of Iraq, then Iraq itself would collapse and we'd have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> right back <b>over</b> <b>there</b> within a year or so.|$|R
5000|$|A musical {{community}} was born, and the Compass Point All Stars label would eventually extend throughout the 1980s to anything either originating from Compass Point Studios, productions by Bill Laswell and remixes by Larry Levan and François K Kevorkian included; or somewhat related <b>to</b> what <b>went</b> on <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> from resident or non-resident artists, regardless of genre and sonic identity, starting back from The B-52's. This largo sensu acception has been displayed on compilations such as Funky Nassau/The Compass Point Story/1980-1986 released by Strut Records, incorporating works by Chaz Jankel, Cristina, Will Powers, Guy Cuevas, along with extensive interviews by David Katz: [...] "I don't believe anything could ever sum it up" [...] said Wally Badarou of Compass Point's heyday, [...] "like nothing could ever sum up Motown or Stax sounds: the studio itself, the engineers, the producers, the artists, the vibes of the time, {{and only the}} specific combination of elements does the job".|$|R
6000|$|Too {{occupied}} with his {{subject to notice}} this ominous reception, the Old Man continued: [...] "I reckon I struck a fresh lead in the new grocery man at the Crossing. He says he'll let the Judge have a pair of boots on credit, but he can't send them over here; and considering that the Judge has got to try them anyway, it don't seem to be asking {{too much for the}} Judge <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>there.</b> He says he'll give us a barrel of pork and a bag of flour if we'll give him the right of using our tail-race and clean out the lower end of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Feeling {{that he had}} by {{that time}} heard quite enough, Tolly Trevor {{effected}} a masterly retreat, {{and returned to the}} place where he had left the horses. On the way he recalled with satisfaction the fact that Paul Bevan had once pointed out to him the exact direction of Simpson's Gully {{at a time when he}} meant to send him on an errand thither. [...] "You've on'y <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> lad," [...] Paul had said, pointing towards the forest in rear of his hut, [...] "and hold on for two days straight as the crow flies till you come to it. You can't well miss it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{all well}} enough," [...] {{he said to}} himself, and he helped Mara up the ladders with the {{greatest}} deference and tenderness. [...] "This little woman is worth ten such girls as Sally, if one only could get her heart. Here we are on our ship, Mara," [...] he said, as he lifted her over the last barrier and set {{her down on the}} deck. [...] "Look over there, do you see Eagle Island? Did you dream when we used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> and spend the day that you ever would be on my ship, as you are to-day?

50|$|Earl Hamner Jnr, whose novel Spencer's Mountain {{had just}} been bought by Warners, was hired to write the {{screenplay}}. Hamner:They gave the screenplay duties Spencer's Mountain to someone else, and I think Mr. Warner thought that he owed me one. He called me one day and asked me what I thought of Palm Springs. I was just newly arrived from New York, and I told him that I'd never been there. He said, 'I want you <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> <b>over</b> Easter Weekend and poke around {{and see if you}} come back with a movie.'... I suppose since he'd just done Spencer's Mountain, he trusted that I could write about young people.When Norman Taurog signed to direct, he felt the script needed some work, so the studio hired David Schwartz, who had just adapted Sex and the Single Girl. They did not like his work so another writer was hired, Danny Arnold, to do a weekly polish.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> Blake {{and tell}} him I {{want to talk to}} him. Then you <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Louise's room. I'll follow directly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said. [...] "We'll <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> {{together}} by and by--but not just now. We'll camp beside the lake where I met you first, instead." ...|$|R
60|$|ASHER. I've been turning {{something}} {{over in my}} mind. And the country looked so fine and fresh I crossed the covered bridge {{to the other side}} of the river. When George was a child I used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> with him on summer afternoons. He was such a companionable little shaver--he'd drop his toys when he'd see me coming home from the office. I can see him now, running along that road over there, stopping to pick funny little bouquets--the kind a child makes, you know--ox-eyed daisies and red clover and buttercups all mixed up together, and he'd carry them home and put them in a glass on the desk in my study.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{you must}} be her friend, whether she'll let you or not," [...] said Miss Cornelia resolutely. [...] "Don't you mind if she's stiff by times--don't notice it. Remember what her life has been--and is--and must always be, I suppose, for creatures like Dick Moore live forever, I understand. You should see how fat he's got since he came home. He used to be lean enough. Just MAKE her be friends--you can do it--you're {{one of those who}} have the knack. Only you mustn't be sensitive. And don't mind if she doesn't seem to want you <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> much. She knows that some women don't like to be where Dick is--they {{complain}} he gives them the creeps. Just get her to come over here as often as she can. She can't get away so very much--she can't leave Dick long, for the Lord knows what he'd do--burn the house down most likely. At nights, after he's in bed and asleep, is about the only time she's free. He always goes to bed early and sleeps like the dead till next morning. That is how you came to meet her at the shore likely. She wanders there considerable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will never}} come," [...] {{asserted}} Dorn, positively. [...] "Lenore, {{people in our}} country do not understand. They are {{too far away from}} realities. But I was six months in France. I've seen the ruined villages, thousands of refugees--and I've met the Huns at the front. I know I've seen the realities. In regard to this war I can only feel. You've got <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> and see for yourself before you realize. You can understand this--that but for you and your power over me I'd be a worn-out, emotionally burnt out man. But through you I seem to be reborn. Still, I shall hate Germans all my life, and in the after-life, what ever that may be. I could give you a thousand reasons. One ought to suffice. You've read, of course, about the regiment of Frenchmen called Blue Devils. I met some of them--got friendly with them. They are great--beyond words to tell! One of them told me that when his regiment drove the Huns out of his own village he had found his mother disemboweled, his wife violated and murdered, his sister left a maimed thing to become the mother of a Hun, his daughter carried off, and his little son crippled for life! ... These are cold facts. As long as I live I will never forget the face of that Frenchman when he told me. Had he cause to hate the Huns? Have I?... I saw all that in the faces of those Huns who would have killed me if they could." ...|$|E
