25|$|Morricone {{never left}} Rome to compose his music and {{never learned to}} speak English. But given that the {{composer}} has always worked in a wide field of composition genres, from absolute music, which he has always produced, to applied music, working as orchestrator as well as conductor in the recording field, {{and then as a}} composer for theatre, radio and cinema, the impression arises that he never really cared <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> his standing in the eyes of Hollywood.|$|E
25|$|The oligarchies {{opposed the}} Cleomenian reforms. With Cleomenes' quick {{victories}} this opposition increased throughout all the Peloponnese. Cleomenes took Corinth and other strategic places. The Cleomenian reforms, {{although they were}} {{not intended to be}} applied to the defeated populations, was a significant factor behind the campaign successes of the Spartan king. Indeed, some of the Achean population wanted to be debt-free and were willing to share their lands for more equity. In reality, Cleomenes did not care <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the defeated population and chose to negotiate with the oligarchies even if the enmity between Aratus and Cleomenes was too great to enable them to come to an agreement.|$|E
500|$|On December 16, 1956, American Broadcasting Company {{president}} Oliver E. Treyz announced Aubrey {{would immediately}} become the network's head of programming and talent. [...] ABC, the weakest {{of the three}} networks, was a perennial also-ran with a weak roster of affiliates and programs, something comparable to {{the early days of}} the Fox Network. Aubrey later said [...] "at that time, there was no ABC. The headquarters was an old riding stable. But I went because [...] Leonard Goldenson in effect said, 'Look, I don't know <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> TV, I'm a lawyer.' And he let me have autonomy." ...|$|E

500|$|Cohn and Levithan's novel {{contained}} many musical references, including {{songs by}} The Cure and Green Day, as did Scafaria's screenplay, which she originally submitted {{with a mix}} CD featuring her ideas for the film's soundtrack, including songs by The Black Keys, Bloc Party, and Frou Frou. In the final cut of the film, however, most of the music was chosen by Sollett, editor Myron Kerstein and music supervisor Linda Cohen. Sollett said that he [...] "got lucky" [...] with the songs {{that he was able}} to choose because, within the financiers and the studio, [...] "there was nobody in that group who knew all <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> music or the music that we had in the film". His objective when selecting the music was to find [...] "the best music you haven't heard yet", primarily from bands based in New York City. While filming in New York, he emailed songs [...] "right out of my iTunes [...] " [...] which he thought would suit particular scenes to Kerstein, who was in Los Angeles assembling the film as it was shot.|$|E
500|$|The final trailer was [...] "unlocked" [...] by fans on March 4, 2015, via {{the use of}} hashtags on Twitter, {{ahead of}} its {{broadcast}} debut during the series premiere of American Crime on March 5. Mendelson felt [...] "this [...] a fine final trailer, teasing what we already know, hinting at the scale and a few new action beats without telling us much we don't already know" [...] adding, [...] "Here we have the fourth and final Avengers: Age of Ultron trailer and we don't know all <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> what transpires in a moment-to-moment sense in the finished 150-minute feature. I have expressed my concern dating back to October that Marvel and Disney would release too many trailers and would by default give away too much plot and character information between October and May. But if this really is the final Avengers 2 trailer, then {{at least on the}} trailer front they have kept the film relatively unspoiled." [...] A week after the final trailer debuted, Marvel revealed that the trailer had [...] "smashed records" [...] with over 35 million views.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the advice}} of his agent, Wesley Rose, Orbison left Monument in mid-1965 for a more lucrative {{contract}} with MGM Records, with Rose taking over as producer. Orbison did not ask for Porter on his recording sessions, and he did not have any hit songs with MGM. Years later, Porter said that, though he really liked Orbison, the singer [...] "never understood the engineer's contribution." [...] It was Rose's advice to leave Monument, and he was [...] "doing his job as a manager" [...] to get more money, but, said Porter, [...] "he didn't know <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the music." [...] Porter felt that only with himself as engineer, Fred Foster as producer and Anita Kerr as arranger was Orbison going to find the right combination.|$|E
2500|$|Friend Danny Hutton {{highlighted}} Brian's studio proficiency, citing what {{he believed}} to be an extraordinary talent at harnessing several different studio spaces while piecing together discrete instrumental patterns and timbres cohesively. He noted, [...] "Somebody could go in right after Brian's session and try to record, and they could never get the sound he got. There {{was a lot of}} subtle stuff he did. ... People don't talk <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it. They always talk about his music. He was fabulous in the studio, in terms of getting sounds. You'd sit there, and that was him. He was just hands-on. He would change the reverb and the echo, and all of a sudden, something just – whoa! – got twice as big and fat." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, manager Ozzie Guillén led the White Sox to a World Series victory, {{their first}} in 88 years. Thomas {{was not on}} the post-season roster of the Series-winning team due to injury, but the team honored his {{perennial}} contributions to the franchise during Game 1 of the Division Series against the Boston Red Sox. Thomas was chosen to throw out the ceremonial first pitch. [...] "What a feeling", Thomas said. [...] "Standing [...] all around the place. People really cheering me. I had tears in my eyes. To really know the fans cared <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> me – it was a great feeling. One of my proudest moments in the game." [...] Though Frank Thomas {{was not on the}} post-season roster, he did earn a World Series ring for his contributions during the season.|$|E

2500|$|After a {{few years}} of discussion, the Minnesota Legislature {{authorized}} Greenleaf Lake State Park in 2003 and appropriated $500,000 to buy property from Geyer and other willing landowners. [...] However the DNR claimed it did not have the funding to run its existing parks, much less plan, develop, and maintain a new one, and the project languished. [...] In March 2007 the DNR and legislature reached a compromise, reestablishing Greenleaf Lake as a state recreation area for lower operation and maintenance costs. [...] At the same time DNR officials began eagerly negotiating to establish Lake Vermilion State Park in northern Minnesota, prompting criticism from Greenleaf Lake supporters that [...] "the DNR bureaucrats in St. Paul did not really care <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> a state park in Meeker County." [...] In December 2007 the first parcel was purchased from Geyer's [...] [...] The Meeker County board of commissioners and the nonprofit organization Minnesota Parks & Trails Council stepped in with additional funds for the $3.2 million deal. [...] The transfer of the rest of Geyer's property is expected to be completed in early 2012, with further acquisitions within the designated boundaries as funds and willing sellers arise.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accuracy}} of a sentiment analysis system is, in principle, {{how well it}} agrees with human judgments. This is usually measured by variant measures based on precision and recall over the two target categories of negative and positive texts. However, according to research human raters typically only agree about 80% of the time (see Inter-rater reliability). Thus, a program which achieves 70% accuracy in classifying sentiment is doing nearly as well as humans, even though such accuracy may not sound impressive. If a program were [...] "right" [...] 100% of the time, humans would still disagree with it about 20% of the time, since they disagree <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> any answer. On the other hand, computer systems will make very different errors than human assessors, and thus the figures are not entirely comparable. For instance, a computer system will have trouble with negations, exaggerations, jokes, or sarcasm, which typically are easy to handle for a human reader: some errors a computer system makes will seem overly naive to a human. In general, the utility for practical commercial tasks of sentiment analysis as it is defined in academic research has been called into question, mostly since the simple one-dimensional model of sentiment from negative to positive yields rather little actionable information for a client worrying {{about the effect of}} public discourse on e.g. brand or corporate reputation.|$|E

He was in a rare taking, was the priest. But what would you have? Johnny had slipped his cable: no more Johnny in the market; and the administration racket clean played out. Next thing, word came to Randall the priest was praying upon Johnny's grave. Papa was pretty full, and got a club, and lit out straight for the place, and there was Galoshes on his knees, {{and a lot of}} natives looking on. You wouldn't think Papa cared <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> anything, unless it was liquor; but he and the priest stuck to it two hours, slanging each other in native, and every time Galoshes tried to kneel down Papa went for him with the club. There never were such larks in Falesá. The end of it was that Captain Randall was knocked over with some kind of a fit or stroke, and the priest got in his goods after all. But he was the angriest priest you ever heard of, and complained to the chiefs about the outrage, as he called it. That was no account, for our chiefs are Protestant here; and, anyway, he had been making trouble about the drum for morning school, and they were glad to give him a wipe. Now he swears old Randall gave Adams poison or something, and when the two meet they grin at each other like baboons." ...|$|E
