5|$|In the mid-1980s, several sets of {{communication}} protocols emerged to fill <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> the data-link layer {{and the application}} layer of the OSI reference model. These included Appletalk, IPX, and NetBIOS with the dominant protocol set during the early 1990s being IPX due to its popularity with MS-DOS users. TCP/IP existed at this point, but it was typically only used by large government and research facilities.|$|E
5|$|Penrose {{originally}} {{discovered the}} P1 tiling in this way, by decomposing a pentagon into six smaller pentagons (one {{half of a}} net of a dodecahedron) and five half-diamonds; he then observed that when he repeated this process <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> pentagons could all be filled by stars, diamonds, boats and other pentagons. By iterating this process indefinitely he obtained {{one of the two}} P1 tilings with pentagonal symmetry.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters {{are fairly}} {{indiscriminate}} in {{their choice of}} habitat. Their requirements are simply an elevated perch from which to watch for prey and a suitable ground substrate in which to dig their breeding burrow. Because their prey is entirely caught on the wing they are not dependent on any vegetation type. A single species, the blue-headed bee-eater, is found inside closed rainforest where it forages {{close to the ground}} in poor light in <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> large trees. Six other species are also closely associated with rainforest, but occur in edge habitat such as along rivers, in tree-fall gaps, off trees overhanging ravines or on emergent tree crowns above the main canopy.|$|E

5|$|He {{worked with}} Corréard, Savigny {{and another of}} the survivors, the {{carpenter}} Lavillette, to construct an accurately detailed scale model of the raft, which was reproduced on the finished canvas, even showing <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> some of planks. Géricault posed models, compiled a dossier of documentation, copied relevant paintings by other artists, and went to Le Havre to study the sea and sky.

5|$|Henry's wealth {{allowed him}} to {{maintain}} what was probably the largest curia regis, or royal court, in Europe. His court attracted huge attention from contemporary chroniclers, and typically comprised {{a number of major}} nobles and bishops, along with knights, domestic servants, prostitutes, clerks, horses and hunting dogs. Within the court were his officials, ministeriales, his friends, amici, and the familiares regis, the king's informal inner circle of confidants and trusted servants. Henry's familiares were particularly important to the operation of his household and government, driving government initiatives and filling <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> the official structures and the king.|$|E
5|$|The Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) is a {{recently}} developed measure of gender inequality calculated by analyzing social institutions, societal practices, and legal norms {{and how these}} factors largely frame gender norms within a society. By combining these sources of inequality, SIGI is able to penalize high levels of inequality {{in each of the}} applicable dimensions, allowing for only partial compensation by <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> the remaining dimensions and the highly inequitable one. Through its analysis of the institutional sources of gender inequality in over 100 countries, SIGI has been proven to add new insights into outcomes for women, even when other factors such as religion and region of the world are controlled for.|$|E

50|$|Divine {{coincidence}} {{relies on}} the assumption specific to the New Keynesian model that <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> natural level of output and the efficient (first-best) level of output is constant and invariant to shocks. This further implies that stabilizing <b>the</b> output <b>gap</b> - <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> actual and natural output — is equivalent to stabilizing <b>the</b> welfare-relevant output <b>gap</b> — <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> actual and efficient output. If, however, non-trivial real imperfections are introduced into <b>the</b> model, <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> natural and efficient output is not constant any more and is affected by shocks. Consequently, divine coincidence disappears, <b>the</b> output <b>gap</b> does not equal <b>the</b> welfare-relevant output <b>gap</b> any longer, and central banks are left with their trade-off between inflation and output stabilization.|$|R

5|$|A double {{is a safe}} hit {{in which}} the batter reaches second base without being called out. This {{scenario}} often occurs when a ball is hit into <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> the outfielders, or down the foul line {{on either side of}} the playing field. Tris Speaker is the all-time leader in doubles in MLB history, with 792, one of which was part of a cycle; Speaker accomplished the feat for the Boston Red Sox on June 9, 1912, against the St. Louis Browns. Two of the other top five players in MLB history in doubles have hit for the cycle: Stan Musial (725 doubles; third all-time) completed the cycle on July 24, 1949; and Craig Biggio (668; fifth all-time) accomplished the feat on April 8, 2002. The single-season MLB leader is Earl Webb, the left-handed outfielder who hit 67 in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Advanced {{technology}} {{was required for}} the planning and construction of large reservoirs and canals. When constructing reservoirs, <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> low ridges in the dry zone plains were used for damming water courses. Two different techniques were used in construction; one method involved making an embankment using natural rock formations across a valley and the other involved diverting water courses through constructed canals to reservoirs. All the reservoirs and canals in an area were interconnected by an intricate network, so that excess water from one will flow into the other. The locations of these constructions indicate that the ancient engineers were aware of geological formations in the sites as well, and made effective use of them. Underground conduits have also been constructed to supply water to and from artificial ponds, {{such as in the}} Kuttam Pokuna and the ponds at Sigiriya.|$|E
5|$|For the Australians, {{the attack}} had been successful, {{as they had}} gained {{possession}} of the main Ottoman line, and after being halted at The Cup they began preparing to defend their gains. Hastily erecting sandbag barriers along the parapet, they settled down {{to wait for the}} first counterattack. As they did so, the brigade reserve—the 1st Battalion—was brought up. Due to crowding in the tunnels that had been used for the attack, the reinforcements were sent via the open ground that had been in front of the old Ottoman positions; despite being behind the recently captured position, the ground was still subjected to heavy Ottoman artillery and machine-gun fire, which was being poured down from positions in overwatch on the flanks. Nevertheless, in company lots, the 1st Battalion moved up and began filling in <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> the assault battalions, while engineers from the 2nd Field Company began the task of extending the tunnels from The Pimple towards the new Australian line.|$|E

5|$|With the Chinese infiltrating the Canadian {{perimeter}} through <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> platoons, D Company {{was close}} to being surrounded. The company commander—Captain J.G.W. Mills—was subsequently forced to call down artillery fire onto his own position on several occasions during the early morning of 25 April to avoid being overrun. The tactic succeeded and the exposed Chinese were soon swept off the position, while the dug-in Canadians escaped unharmed. The Chinese persisted however, launching a number of smaller attacks {{during the rest of}} the night, but these were again repulsed by artillery and small arms fire. By dawn the attacks on the Canadian positions had abated, and with D Company remaining in control of the summit they were able to recover the previously abandoned machine-gun at first light. Meanwhile, on the right flank B Company was also able to re-occupy the platoon position it had been forced to relinquish earlier the previous evening. The Chinese had suffered heavily during the night, with perhaps as many as 300 killed by the Patricias.|$|E
5|$|This brought {{together}} England's leading batsmen, Hutton and Compton. The latter, coming in upon {{the fall of}} Edrich, ran down the pitch before the ball was bowled and had to quickly play a defensive shot on the run. He clipped the next ball to the leg side for two runs before surviving a confident leg before wicket appeal from Johnson {{when he was on}} eight. Compton appeared ready to walk off, but umpire Chester declined the appeal, much to his surprise. England reached 50 in 65 minutes and with Lindwall missing, Bradman had difficulties in spreading the workload among his depleted bowling resources. The part-time leg spin of Barnes was brought on as the fifth bowling option to give the others some time to rest, and Miller resumed bowling late in the day, delivering slow off spin to conserve energy. Hutton and Compton exploited the depleted bowling attack and began to score freely, using their placement to bisect <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> the fielders. The pair did not give a chance apart from when Compton aimed an uppish square drive from Johnston that flew in the air wide of cover point.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{determined}} the Tug Argan gap {{the best possible}} place to make a stand out of the three roadways, and also the most likely invasion route, and thus positioned {{the bulk of the}} army around it. On the British right, to the north of Tug Argan, were three companies of the 3/15 Punjab Regiment, set upon a group of west-facing strongpoints overlooking the rough wilderness that lay beside the road. South of them lay the gap itself, manned by a contingent of Rhodesian troops. They sat upon a line of small hills, named from north to south Black, Knobbly, Mill, Observation, and Castle Hills. These hills, positioned in a row with 2,000–2,500 yard gaps in between, housed machine-gun nests surrounded with light rings of barbed wire and served as the Rhodesians' defensive strongholds and the main defense for the British of the pass. On the British left were another group of Indian troops, located upon the aptly named 'Punjab Ridge' facing directly to the south. Unfortunately for the British, the front was too wide for the troops available, and <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> hills too large, leaving the defenses prone to infiltration. Also, due to the hills being in a single line, the position lacked depth. Meanwhile, De Simone, arriving {{at the site of the}} impending battle on 10 August, set his forces directly opposite the British positions. On the left, II Brigade prepared to advance through the wilderness towards the Punjab troops in the north. In the Italian center, XIV Brigade faced the Rhodesian hilltop positions within the pass, and XV Brigade looked north towards Punjab Ridge on the Italian right. Behind them were XIII Brigade and the armored vehicles.|$|E
