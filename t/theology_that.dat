5|$|Branham {{became more}} {{controversial}} {{in his later}} years and this was particularly evident in his development of a <b>theology</b> <b>that</b> emphasized a few select doctrines. His theology seemed complicated and bizarre to many people who admired him personally. Although not always consistent with each other, his primary concerns were eschatology, the denial of an eternal hell, Oneness Pentecostalism, predestination, eternal security and the serpent's seed. Branham asserted that his doctrinal teachings were given to him by divine revelation.|$|E
5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} {{has become}} popular among poor Americans, {{particularly those who}} seek personal and social advancement. It has seen significant growth in black and Hispanic churches and is particularly popular among immigrants. Apologists for the movement note its ethnic diversity and argue that it encompasses a variety of views. Joel Robbins of Cambridge University notes that most anthropologists attribute the theology's appeal to the poor—especially in the Global South—to {{the fact that it}} promises security and helps explain capitalism. Simon Coleman developed a theory based on the doctrine's rhetoric and the feeling of belonging it gave parishioners. In a study of the Swedish Word of Life Church, he noted that members felt part of a complex gift-exchange system, giving to God and then awaiting a gift in return (either from God directly or through another church member). Hillsong Church, the largest congregation in Australia, teaches a form of prosperity <b>theology</b> <b>that</b> emphasizes personal success. Marion Maddox has argued that this message has drawn a significant number of upwardly mobile Australians.|$|E

25|$|Despite his {{conservative}} theological beliefs, Machen {{was never able}} to fully embrace popularist fundamentalism either. His refusal to accept premillennialism and other aspects of Fundamentalist belief was based upon his belief that Reformed Theology was the most biblical form of Christian belief—a <b>theology</b> <b>that</b> was generally missing from Fundamentalism at the time. Moreover, Machen's scholarly work and ability to engage with modernist theology was at odds with Fundamentalism's anti-intellectual attitude.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the same}} time, Mahavira (the 24th Tirthankara in Jainism) {{propagated}} a <b>theology</b> <b>that</b> was to later become Jainism.

Rishabhanatha was the 1st Tirthankara. The Vedas are believed to have documented a few Tirthankaras and an ascetic order similar to the shramana movement.|$|E
25|$|Hermeticism, {{also called}} Hermetism, is a religious, philosophical, and esoteric {{tradition}} based primarily upon writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus ("Thrice Great").

40|$|This {{essay is}} {{concerned}} with the intersection between theology, social theory, and evolution. In an effort to sketch an ecologically sound theology of social solidarity and a global ethics, the author examines constructive <b>theologies</b> <b>that</b> take cosmic evolution as a central organizing principle. While the inherent utopianism of Washington Gladden ś social gospel cannot be revived, his theology provides useful insights into the creative use of scientific and religious discourse for a contemporary democratic theology in search of the common good...|$|R

25|$|The Latin Rite of the Catholic Church {{does not}} teach that the {{suffering}} of purgatory is imposed by God.

Knowing the acts of love that those on earth are offering for one might conceivably make more bearable the remorse.|$|R
25|$|In 1746 the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians {{created the}} College of New Jersey, later renamed Princeton University. The mission was {{training}} New Light Presbyterian ministers.

Meanwhile, Princeton Seminary, under the leadership of Charles Hodge, originated a conservative <b>theology</b> <b>that</b> in large part shaped Fundamentalist Protestantism in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Many American {{proponents of}} neo-Lamarckism were {{strongly}} influenced by Louis Agassiz {{and a number of}} them, including Hyatt and Packard, were his students.

Agassiz never accepted evolution; his followers did, but they continued his program of searching for orderly patterns in nature, which they considered to be consistent with divine providence, and preferred evolutionary mechanisms like neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis that would be likely to produce them.|$|E
25|$|The Bhagavad Gita is a {{dialogue}} between Krishna and Arjuna, and presents Bhakti, Jnana and Karma yoga as alternate ways to spiritual liberation, with the choice left to the individual. The text discusses dharma, and its pursuit as duty without craving for fruits of one's actions, {{as a form of}} spiritual path to liberation. The text, state Clooney and Stewart, succinctly summarizes the foundations of Vaishnava <b>theology</b> <b>that</b> the entire universe exists within Vishnu, and all aspects of life and living is not only a divine order but divinity itself. Bhakti, in Bhagavad Gita, is an act of sharing, and a deeply personal awareness of spirituality within and without.|$|E
25|$|Theistic {{evolution}} and evolutionary creationism are <b>theologies</b> <b>that</b> reconcile {{belief in a}} creator with biological evolution.

Spokespersons from the Catholic Church have specifically criticized biblical creationism for relying upon literal interpretations of biblical scripture as the basis for determining scientific fact.|$|R
2500|$|Unitarianism is {{a proper}} noun and follows the same English usage as other <b>theologies</b> <b>that</b> have {{developed}} within a religious movement (Calvinism, Anabaptism, Adventism, Wesleyanism, Lutheranism, etc.). The term existed shortly {{before it became}} {{the name of a}} religious movement, [...] thus occasionally it is used as a common noun that would describe any understanding of Jesus Christ that denies the Trinity or which believes that God is only one person. In that case, it would be a nontrinitarian belief system not necessarily associated with the Unitarian religious movement.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, {{the author}} brings into {{discussion}} the Romanian phenomenon of migration, {{often described as}} ‘the Romanian Exodus’ due to the impressive numbers of Romanians who emigrated to the West (especially to Western Europe). His aim is to bring a theological dimension to the sociological discussion. He argues for the need of ‘local’ or ‘contextualized’ Romanian <b>theologies</b> <b>that</b> could meet the current social events experienced by Romanian people. He believes that the Romanian Exodus could be a starting point in developing such theologies. KEY WORDS: migration, Romania, Exodus, indigenous theology, contextual theology...|$|R
25|$|For Moltmann's {{second major}} work, The Crucified God, the {{philosophical}} inspiration {{comes from a}} different tendency within Marxist philosophy. In Explanation of the Theme, his introduction to the book, Moltmann acknowledges that {{the direction of his}} questioning has shifted to that of existentialist philosophy and the Marxism of the Frankfurt School, particularly Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer – close associates of Paul Tillich. An unacknowledged influence, and certainly an important parallel, is probably the Death of God <b>theology</b> <b>that</b> was winning notice in the mid-1960s, particularly the essay collection under that title, edited by William Hamilton and Thomas J.

25|$|According to Prof. Dennis Hudson, Navalar's {{contributions}} although {{began in}} Jaffna, spread to both in Sri Lanka {{as well as}} Southern India, thus establishing two centres of reform. He had two schools, two presses and pressed on against Christian missionary activity on both sides as well as against Hindus who he thought were unorthodox. He produced approximately ninety-seven Tamil publications, twenty three were his own creations, eleven were commentaries, and forty were his editions of those works of grammar, literature, liturgy, and <b>theology</b> <b>that</b> were not previously available in print. With this recovery, editing, and publishing of ancient works, Navalar laid the foundations for the recovery of lost Tamil classics that his successors such as U. V. Swaminatha Iyer and C.W. Thamotharampillai continued. He {{was the first person}} to deploy the prose style in the Tamil language and according to Tamil scholar Kamil Zvelebil in style it bridged the medieval to the modern.|$|E

50|$|In the New Testament, Jesus Christ {{repeatedly}} {{calls for}} his disciples {{to heal the}} sick and serve the poor, but also for them to “make disciples of all nations.” In striving to obey such commands, Western Christians have debated the nature of proper evangelism, often emphasizing either eschatological, or material realities within missionary efforts. Much of Euro-American Protestantism has emphasized Jesus’ eschatological and soteriological statements in developing <b>theologies</b> <b>that</b> emphasize personal salvation over the provision of material needs.
