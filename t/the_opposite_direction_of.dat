5|$|The term Cyclone {{was coined}} by Henry Piddington of the British East India Company to {{describe}} the devastating storm of December 1789 in Coringa, India. A cyclone forms around a low-pressure area. Anticyclone, the term {{for the kind of}} weather around a high-pressure area, was coined in 1877 by Francis Galton to indicate an area whose winds revolved in <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> a cyclone. In British English, <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> clockwise is referred to as anticlockwise, making the label anticyclones a logical extension.|$|E
5|$|Third, {{because the}} front and rear tires can have {{different}} slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. When understeering, the steering angle must be greater, and when oversteering, the steering angle must be less than it would be if the slip angles were equal to maintain a given turn radius. Some authors even use the term counter-steering to refer to the need on some bikes under some conditions to steer in <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the turn (negative steering angle) to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage.|$|E

However, it was also argued that the large grass median was sufficient to prevent cross-over collisions, given that Highway410 has a similar median.|$|R
40|$|Using a {{database}} from Chile, we have tested empirically {{the effects of}} economic residential segregation on educational achievements. Our hypothesis is based on literature's findings about segregation's negative impact on individuals' well being. We found that segregation has negative impacts. This result would have interesting policy implications and goes in <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> those investigations' findings, which indicate that segregation has just negligible effects...|$|R
5|$|A simple rule {{of thumb}} is that for {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air flows from the center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E
5|$|Once a turn is established, {{the torque}} {{that must be}} applied to the {{steering}} mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike. At speeds below the capsize speed, described below in the section on Eigenvalues and also called the inversion speed, the self-stability of the bike will cause it to tend to steer into the turn, righting itself and exiting the turn, unless a torque is applied in <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the turn. At speeds above the capsize speed, the capsize instability will cause it to tend to steer out of the turn, increasing the lean, unless a torque is applied {{in the direction of the}} turn. At the capsize speed no input steering torque is necessary to maintain the steady-state turn.|$|E
5|$|Bok tried {{twice to}} flee from slavery {{at the age}} of 14. The first {{instance}} happened early one morning after he had been sent out with the cattle. Bok blindly ran down a road for several miles before he was captured by one of Giemma's fellow militia members. Giemma's peer returned Francis to the Giemma's compound, where he was beaten with a bullwhip. Bok attempted to escape once again just two days later, when he fled in <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> his previous escape. He once again fled for several miles, this time keeping to the forest. He stopped for water at a local stream crossing, where he was spotted by Giemma who happened to be there as well. Giemma forced Francis back to his home, this time promising to kill him. Francis was beaten again, but Giemma chose not to kill him, as Francis had become too valuable to the family as a slave.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, Braathens SAFE {{applied for}} {{concession}} for a route from Oslo to Bodø via Trondheim without subsidies. They {{also stated that}} {{they were willing to}} fly all domestic routes without subsidies, granted that they were awarded all routes. This was based on the acquisition of de Havilland Heron aircraft, which could use shorter runways and has a capacity of 15 people. SAS was granted the concession to Bodø and Trondheim, but the Ministry of Transport issued a concession to Braathens SAFE on the route from Oslo via Tønsberg Airport, Jarlsberg to Stavanger. The plane started in Stavanger in the morning, and operated <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> SAS' route from Oslo to Stavanger, which continued onwards to London. The first flight was made on 3 May 1952, with the Heron LN-PSG Per. From 7 to 14 May, the plane went {{on a tour of the}} country, visiting several airports. Regular services started on 18 August and a one-way ticket cost NOK95.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E

50|$|East of Pendleton, I-84 climbs Emigrant Hill, a 6% grade, {{into the}} Blue Mountains. This grade {{is known for}} the fact that the {{westbound}} lanes switchback twice on its descent into Pendleton. Eastbound lanes feature what are the tightest curves allowed on the Interstate Highway system, even though those curves are on the uphill (eastbound) direction. This grade is also well known because of the distance between eastbound and westbound lanes, nearly 2 mi between <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> travel at some points.|$|R

On some freeways, the two carriageways are built on different alignments; this may be done to make use of available corridors in a mountainous area or to provide narrower corridors through dense urban areas.|$|R
40|$|Second {{harmonic}} generation and optical parametric amplification in negative-index metamaterials (NIMs) are studied. <b>The</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wave vector and the Poynting vector in NIMs {{results in a}} "backward" phase-matching condition, causing {{significant changes in the}} Manley-Rowe relations and spatial distributions of the coupled field intensities. It is shown that absorption in NIMs can be compensated by backward optical parametric amplification. The possibility of distributed-feedback parametric oscillation with no cavity has been demonstrated. The feasibility of the generation of entangled pairs of left- and right-handed counter-propagating photons is discussed. Comment: 7 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|Some {{factors that}} can {{potentially}} reduce the performance of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) and trigger an internal erosion of the GCL are high gradient, subgrade and confining pressure. Previous studies mainly investigated the internal erosion occurrence by monitoring the hydraulic conductivity with water flow coming from above. In this research, <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> water pressure were also applied to the sample.

The result is the oscillation of the fan blades creating vibrations and hence noise.|$|E
