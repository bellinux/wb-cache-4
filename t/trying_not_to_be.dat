500|$|The race {{took place}} in very wet and windy conditions. This {{included}} a headwind {{in the early stages}} of the race, which delayed the formation of a breakaway. When the breakaway did form, it included seven riders, who built up a nine-minute lead within the first hour of racing. These riders were Tim Kerkhof (...) , Alexis Gougeard (...) , Albert Timmer (...) , Alex Dowsett (...) , Pavel Brutt (Tinkoff-Saxo), Jesse Sergent (Trek Factory Racing) and Mirko Tedeschi (...) [...] Soon afterwards the peloton was split into groups as riders began to withdraw from the race. The principal difficulty throughout the race was the wind: Cyclingnews.com described the riders as [...] "constantly balancing on their bike, leaning into the wind, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> blown off the road".|$|E
2500|$|I was at {{the post}} office with my Mum and Auntie [...] They put us in the police ute and said they were taking us to Broome. They put the mums in there as well. But when we'd gone [...] they stopped, and threw the mothers out of the car. We jumped on our mothers' backs, crying, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> left behind. But the policemen pulled us off and threw us back in the car. They pushed the mothers away and drove off, while our mothers were chasing the car, running and crying after us. We were {{screaming}} in the back of that car. When we got to Broome they put me and my cousin in the Broome lock-up. We were only ten years old. We were in the lock-up for two days waiting for the boat to Perth.|$|E

60|$|I can't make it out. It {{seems very}} unfair. The more I <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> extravagant, the more I spent.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm naughty sometimes, {{and so is}} Chubbins," [...] said Twinkle, honestly. [...] "But we <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> any naughtier than we can help." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Noble girl!" [...] cried Bartley, with {{irony that}} pleased her better than praise. Women like <b>to</b> <b>be</b> understood, {{even when they}} <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> understood.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tilly Bassett, {{whatever}} {{made you}} put wormwood and catnip in your stuffin'?" [...] demanded Ma, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> severe, {{for all the}} rest were laughing, and Tilly looked ready to cry.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{laugh at}} me, Jo! I didn't mean anyone should know till the time came. I only meant {{to change the}} little bottle for a big one, and I gave all my money to get it, and I'm truly <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> selfish any more." ...|$|E
60|$|The other junior Britling {{danced in}} front of the hero, who was walking beside Mrs. Britling and <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too aggressively a soldierly figure. He looked a very man in khaki and more of a boy than ever. Mrs. Teddy came behind, quietly elated.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, yes; {{and you are}} not frightened at me? Well, I will <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> frightened at myself. Time was, however, when I {{should have}} been." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{ended with}} a little mocking laugh. That was the perverse side of her, the cat using her claws. I <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> angry, but failed.|$|R
6000|$|March <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{nervous about}} his son's lingering; he {{was ashamed of}} his anxiety; but {{he said in a}} low voice, [...] "Better be off, Tom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very patiently I {{waited in}} the dark little hole, {{listening}} to the steady 'tick-tock!' of the machinery behind me and <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nervous. After awhile I heard the old man {{come into the room}} and exclaim sorrowfully because his captive cuckoo had escaped from its cage. He could not imagine what had become of me, and I kept still and laughed to myself to think how I would presently surprise him.|$|E
6000|$|Swollen with greatness, {{slightly}} afraid {{lest the}} noble blood of Nottingham change its mind {{and leave him}} at any street corner, Babbitt paraded with Sir Gerald Doak to the movie palace and in silent bliss sat beside him, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too enthusiastic, lest the knight despise his adoration of six-shooters and broncos. At the end Sir Gerald murmured, [...] "Jolly good picture, this. So awfully decent of you to take me. Haven't enjoyed myself so much for weeks. All these Hostesses--they never let {{you go to the}} cinema!" ...|$|E
60|$|She was {{perfectly}} unreasonable, and right {{in most of}} the things she said. He {{was perfectly}} unreasonable, and right in all of the things he said. Their argument was absurdly hot, and hurt them pathetically. It was difficult, at first, for Carl to admit that he was at odds with his playmate. Surely this was a sham dissension, of which they would soon tire, which they would smilingly give up. Then, he was <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too contentious, but was irritated into retorting. After fifteen minutes they were staring at each other as at intruding strangers, he remembering {{the fact that she was}} a result of city life; she the fact that he wasn't a product of city life.|$|E
60|$|Istra was curled {{on the bed}} in a leaf-green silk kimono with a great gold-mounted {{medallion}} pinned at her breast. Mr. Wrenn <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{shocked at}} the kimono.|$|R

60|$|It {{happened}} {{one afternoon}} in the drawing-room. There were visitors that day--women; and women seem fatal to me. I was in the background, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen, for, though I had been brought in by Peter, the family never liked my coming into the drawing-room. I was hoping {{for a piece of}} cake and not paying much attention to the conversation, which was all about somebody called Toto, whom I had not met. Peter's mother said Toto was a sweet little darling, he was; and one of the visitors said Toto had not been at all himself that day and she was quite worried. And a good lot more about how all that Toto would ever take for dinner was a little white meat of chicken, chopped up fine. It was not very interesting, and I had allowed my attention to wander.|$|E
6000|$|Before supper she found, {{by half a}} dozen {{telephone}} calls, that Fern {{had fled}} to the Minniemashie House. She hastened there, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> self-conscious {{about the people who}} looked at her on the street. The clerk said indifferently that he [...] "guessed" [...] Miss Mullins was up in Room 37, and left Carol to find the way. She hunted along the stale-smelling corridors with their wallpaper of cerise daisies and poison-green rosettes, streaked in white spots from spilled water, their frayed red and yellow matting, and rows of pine doors painted a sickly blue. She could not find the number. In the darkness {{at the end of a}} corridor she had to feel the aluminum figures on the door-panels. She was startled once by a man's voice: [...] "Yep? Whadyuh want?" [...] and fled. When she reached the right door she stood listening. She made out a long sobbing. There was no answer till her third knock; then an alarmed [...] "Who is it? Go away!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let's {{cut out the}} next," [...] said Todd, and she consented, though Sanford Hunt came boyishly, blushingly up to ask her for a dance.... She was {{intensely}} {{aware that}} she was a wall-flower, in a row with the anxious Miss Ingalls and the elderly frump, Miss Fisle. Sam Weintraub seemed to avoid her, and, though she tried to persuade herself that his greasy, curly, red hair and his pride of evening clothes and sharp face were blatantly Jewish, she knew that she admired his atmosphere of gorgeousness and was in despair at being shut out of it. She even feared that Sanford Hunt hadn't really wanted to dance with her, and she wilfully ignored his frequent glances of friendliness and his efforts to introduce her and his [...] "lady friend." [...] She was silent and hard, while poor Todd, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a radical and lecture on single-tax or municipal ownership, attempted to be airy about the theater, which meant the one show he had seen since he had come to New York.|$|E
6000|$|... "Try <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> surprised; <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alarmed. If my mind to-morrow is {{the same}} as my mind to-night, I shall attempt to make my escape. I shall take refuge with Lady Northlake.|$|R
2500|$|In {{a recent}} {{interview}} Tatler stated that he now <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> influenced by modern bands and keep his sound, although he imagines that [...] "little bits creep into the writing process." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Anders, I'll <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{quite so}} clibber in future; but ask Grabantak {{if he will}} go with me on an {{expedition}} among these islands. I want very much to examine them all." ...|$|R
6000|$|Our {{steps were}} in fact, I {{am happy to}} think, almost soft enough for a death-chamber as we stood in the big, vague sala of the three sisters, spectators of their {{simplified}} state and their beautiful blighted rooms, the memories, the portraits, the shrunken relics of nine Doges. If I wanted a first chapter it was here made to my hand; the painter of life and manners, as he glanced about, could only sigh--as he so frequently has to--over the vision of so much more truth than he can use. What on earth {{is the need to}} [...] "invent," [...] in the midst of tragedy and comedy that never cease? Why, with the subject itself, all round, so inimitable, condemn the picture to the silliness of <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aware of it? The charming lonely girls, carrying so simply their great name and fallen fortunes, the despoiled decaduta house, the unfailing Italian grace, the space so out of scale with actual needs, the absence of books, the presence of ennui, the sense of the length of the hours and the shortness of everything else--all this was a matter not only for a second chapter and a third, but for a whole volume, a dénoûment and a sequel.|$|E
60|$|But the plebeians {{were always}} <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{left out of}} everything. By and by, they said under Servius Tullius, the city was divided into six quarters, and all the {{families}} living in them into six tribes, each of which had a tribune to watch over it, bring up the number of its men, and lead them to battle. Another division of the citizens, both patrician and plebeian, was made every five years. They were all counted and numbered and divided off into centuries according to their wealth. Then these centuries, or hundreds, had votes, by the persons they chose, {{when it was a}} question of peace or war. Their meeting was called the Comitia; but as there were more patrician centuries than plebeian ones, the patricians still had much more power. Besides, the Senate and all the magistrates were in those days always patricians. These magistrates were chosen every year. There were two consuls, who were like kings for the time, only that they wore no crowns; they had purple robes, and sat in chairs ornamented with ivory, and they were always attended by lictors, who carried bundles of rods tied round an axe--the first for scourging, the second for beheading. There were under them two prætors, or judges, who tried offences; two quæstors, who attended to the public buildings; and two censors, who had to look after the numbering and registering of the people in their tribes and centuries. The consuls in general commanded the army, but sometimes, when there was a great need, one single leader was chosen and was called dictator. Sometimes a dictator was chosen merely to fulfil an omen, by driving a nail into the head of the great statue of Jupiter in the Capitol. Besides these, all the priests had to be patricians; the chief of all was called Pontifex Maximus. Some say this was because he was the fax (maker) of pontes (bridges), as he blessed them and decided by omens where they should be; but others think the word was Pompifex, and that he was the maker of pomps or ceremonies. There were many priests as well as augurs, who had to draw omens from the flight of birds or the appearance of sacrifices, and who kept the account of the calendar of lucky and unlucky days, and of festivals.|$|E
6000|$|It {{pressed on}} him with this that never had a man been in so many places at once. [...] "I quite {{understand}} that she's yours. Only you see she's not mine." [...] He felt he could somehow, for honesty, risk that, as he had the moral certainty she wouldn't repeat it and least of all to Mrs. Lowder, who would find in it a disturbing implication. This {{was part of what}} he liked in the good lady, that she didn't repeat, and also that she gave him a delicate sense of her shyly wishing him to know it. That was in itself a hint of possibilities between them, of a relation, beneficent and elastic for him, which wouldn't engage him further than he could see. Yet even as he afresh made this out he felt how strange it all was. She wanted, Susan Shepherd then, as appeared, the same thing Kate wanted, only wanted it, as still further appeared, in so different a way and from a motive so different, even though scarce less deep. Then Mrs. Lowder wanted, by so odd an evolution of her exuberance, exactly what each of the others did; and he was between them all, he was in the midst. Such perceptions made occasions--well, occasions for fairly wondering if it mightn't be best just to consent, luxuriously, to be the ass the whole thing involved. <b>Trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> and yet keeping in it was of the two things the more asinine. He was glad there was no male witness; it was a circle of petticoats; he shouldn't have liked a man to see him. He only had for a moment a sharp thought of Sir Luke Strett, the great master of the knife whom Kate in London had spoken of Milly as in commerce with, and whose renewed intervention at such a distance, just announced to him, required some accounting for. He had a vision of great London surgeons--if this one was a surgeon--as incisive all round; so that he should perhaps after all not wholly escape the ironic attention of his own sex. The most {{he might be able to}} do was not to care; while he was trying not to he could take that in. It was a train, however, that brought up the vision of Lord Mark as well. Lord Mark had caught him twice in the fact--the fact of his absurd posture; and that made a second male. But it was comparatively easy not to mind Lord Mark.|$|E

60|$|Daisy {{accepted}} passively the tokens of affection, with {{a little}} sad smile. She <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unsympathetic. Mrs Griffith led her daughter into the sitting-room where George and Edith were sitting. George was very white.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Mouse! I thought you'd <b>be</b> glad <b>to</b> see me. I've never rowed with you, have I? I've <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> temperamental with you. That's why I wired you, {{when there}} are others I've known for years." ...|$|R

50|$|After the Festival of the Undead, Darren {{must choose}} his third trial which is The Hall of Flames, a metal room with various jets that emit flames periodically. Darren must {{remain in the}} room for {{approximately}} fifteen minutes, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 'toasted' by the scorching hot flames. This is revealed {{by many to be}} one of the hardest trials he could have picked, and he barely survives it.|$|E
50|$|Zapffe's {{theory is}} that humans are born with an overdeveloped skill (understanding, self-knowledge) which does not fit into nature's design. The human craving for {{justification}} on matters such as life and death cannot be satisfied, hence humanity has a need that nature cannot satisfy. The tragedy, following this theory, is that humans spend all their time <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> human. The human being, therefore, is a paradox.|$|E
