5|$|Following Massachusetts' lead, the Federalist {{minorities}} in both Virginia and New York {{were able to}} obtain ratification in convention by linking ratification to recommended amendments. A committee of the Virginia convention headed by law professor George Wythe forwarded forty recommended amendments to Congress, twenty of which enumerated individual rights and another twenty of which enumerated states' rights. The latter amendments included limitations on federal powers <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>taxes</b> and regulate trade.|$|E

50|$|Many {{countries}} that impose tax have subdivisions or subsidiary jurisdictions that also impose tax. This feature {{is not unique}} to federal systems, like the U.S., Switzerland and Australia, but rather is a common feature of national systems. The top tier system may impose restrictions on both the ability of the lower tier system <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>tax</b> as well as how certain aspects of such lower tier system work, including the granting of tax exemptions. The restrictions may be imposed directly on the lower jurisdiction's power <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>tax</b> or indirectly by regulating tax effects of the exemption at the upper tier.|$|R

5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1861, Johnson tried mightily to assert the {{legitimacy}} of the fledgling government, but to no avail. Its jurisdiction extended only as far as the area controlled by the Confederate Army. Johnson came woefully short of raising the 46,000 troops requested by the Confederate Congress in Richmond. Efforts <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>taxes</b> and to compel citizens to turn over their guns to the government were similarly unsuccessful. On January 3, 1862, Johnson requested a sum of $3million from the Confederate Congress to meet the provisional government's operating expenses. The Congress instead approved a sum of $2million, the expenditure of which required approval of Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin and President Davis.|$|E
5|$|Many colonists, however, had {{developed}} a different conception of the empire. The colonies were not directly represented in Parliament, and colonists argued that Parliament had no right <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>taxes</b> upon them. This tax dispute {{was part of a}} larger divergence between British and American interpretations of the British Constitution and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies. The orthodox British view, dating from the Glorious Revolution of 1688, was that Parliament was the supreme authority throughout the empire, and so, by definition, anything that Parliament did was constitutional. In the colonies, however, the idea {{had developed}} that the British Constitution recognized certain fundamental rights that no government could violate, not even Parliament. After the Townshend Acts, some essayists even began to question whether Parliament had any legitimate jurisdiction in the colonies at all. Anticipating the arrangement of the British Commonwealth, by 1774 American writers such as Samuel Adams, James Wilson, and Thomas Jefferson were arguing that Parliament was the legislature of Great Britain only, and that the colonies, which had their own legislatures, were connected to the rest of the empire only through their allegiance to the Crown.|$|E
5|$|The Free State {{began using}} its new-found {{control of the}} region <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>taxes</b> from the local population, {{gathered}} using similar hostage tactics to the Manyema. The taxes were initially collected {{in the form of}} ivory but when ivory supplies began to run low the Free State switched to natural rubber. The rubber was collected from Landolphia owariensis gentilii rubber vines which were relatively scarce in the area with an average frequency of around one plant in each acre. The rubber was gathered by tapping a rubber vine and placing a pot beneath to collect the latex which could be used in the production of rubber for the European market. If the vines were a long distance from the ground the gatherer would have had to climb a tree, tap the plant and hold the collecting pot beneath the vine, possibly for an entire day. Hence rubber collection was a labour-intensive process which made it unpopular with the villagers. Indeed, they preferred the Manyema to the Free State authorities as the Manyema only took low bulk, high value items such as ivory or slaves because of the long distances from their homeland whereas the state, with its steamboat transports, could afford to make the people harvest the low value high bulk rubber. By September 1892 the Free State was using its military forces to attack and occupy villages in the Lulonga and Maringa river valleys to expand its tax base.|$|E

5|$|The {{heart of}} the plan was the Constitutional Agreement on Krajina (Part One). Part One defined Krajina as an {{autonomous}} region of Croatia, with borders {{based on the results}} of the 1991 Croatian census (which identified eleven municipalities with an absolute Serb majority). Those areas would enjoy a high level of autonomy, with most authority transferred from the central government in Zagreb to Krajina. The region would have its own president, cabinet, legislation, courts, police force, emblem, flag and currency, and the right <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>taxes</b> and make international agreements. Part One also provided for demilitarising the autonomous area. Part Two of the plan, the Agreements Concerning Slavonia, Southern Baranja, Western Sirmium and Other Areas, related to areas where the Croatian Serbs did not form the majority in 1991 (including eastern and western Slavonia) and contained transitional provisions. Part Three of the plan spelled out safeguards on human rights, fundamental freedoms, prosecution of war crimes, a human-rights court with international judges, and provisions allowing dual Croatian and Yugoslav citizenship for Croatian Serbs. The plan envisaged that western Slavonia would be the first to be restored to Croatian control, followed by eastern Slavonia (where a transitional UN administration would be set up before the handover).|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{from the}} laity took longer to surface. This {{resistance}} focused on two things: the King's right to demand military service, {{and his right}} <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>taxes.</b> At the Salisbury parliament of February 1297, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, {{in his capacity as}} Marshal of England, objected to a royal summons of military service. Bigod argued that the military obligation only extended to service alongside the King; if the King intended to sail to Flanders, he could not send his subjects to Gascony. In July, Bigod and Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford and Constable of England, drew up a series of complaints known as the Remonstrances, in which objections to the extortionate level of taxation were voiced. Undeterred, Edward requested another lay subsidy. This one was particularly provocative, because the King had sought consent only from a small group of magnates, rather than from representatives from the communities in parliament. While Edward was in Winchelsea, preparing for the campaign in Flanders, Bigod and Bohun turned up at the Exchequer to prevent the collection of the tax. As the King left the country with a greatly reduced force, the kingdom seemed {{to be on the verge}} of civil war. What resolved the situation was the English defeat by the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. The renewed threat to the homeland gave king and magnates common cause. Edward signed the Confirmatio cartaruma confirmation of Magna Carta and its accompanying Charter of the Forestand the nobility agreed to serve with the King on a campaign in Scotland.|$|E

25|$|Since World War II, {{the federal}} {{constitution}} authorizes the Confederation to levy {{a number of}} taxes, the most significant of which are an income tax, a withholding tax and a value added tax. However, Switzerland is unique among modern sovereign states in that the authority to levy these taxes is limited in duration and extent. The Constitution imposes an upper limit on the federal tax rates and causes the federal authority <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>taxes</b> to expire in 2020. A renewal of that authority requires a constitutional amendment, which must be approved in a popular referendum by both {{a majority of the}} popular vote and the cantons. If that renewal is not approved at the polls (as it has been six times since 1958), the Confederation itself will conceivably dissolve for lack of funds.
