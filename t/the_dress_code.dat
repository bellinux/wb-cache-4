5|$|Another {{issue that}} {{concerns}} women is <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> <b>code</b> expected of them. Islam requires {{both men and}} women to dress modestly; this concept is known as hijab and covers a wide interpretation of behavior and garments. There is mixed opinion among feminists over extremes of externally imposed control. Women from other religions are also expected to follow dress codes.|$|E
5|$|Balls {{are major}} events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in 9th week of Trinity Term, are called Commemoration balls; <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> <b>code</b> is usually white tie.

5|$|Soon after <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> <b>code</b> dust-up made headlines, {{a letter}} {{was sent to}} The New York Times by the Women's Professional Billiard Association (WPBA), by its {{president}} Belinda Bearden, disputing the facts as reported. According to the WPBA, <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> <b>code</b> was self-imposed by the players {{in an attempt to}} improve the image of women's pool and to attract more spectators and press to the sport, and that Balukas was the only participant at Binghamton unwilling to comply. They further explained that Balukas first withdrew from the women's division but later returned and asked to play after player assignments had been completed. A vote to allow her to play resulted in a tally of 8–7 in her favor, but after they moved to consult a player who was not present for the vote, Balukas again withdrew from the competition, and that was where the matter had ended.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>dress</b> <b>code</b> of the British headbangers {{reflected}} the newly found cohesion {{of the movement}} and recalled the look of 1960s rockers and American bikers. The common elements were long hair and jeans, black or white T-shirts with band logos and cover art and leather jackets or denim vests adorned with patches. Following the example of Judas Priest, elements of S fashion entered the metal wardrobe of the 1980s and it became typical to show off metallic studs and ornaments, or for metal musicians to wear spandex or leather trousers. Elements of militaria, such as bullet belts and insignia, were also introduced at this time. This style of dress quickly became the uniform of metalheads worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Formerly, men {{not wearing}} {{military}} uniform wore knee breeches of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included trains and tiaras or feathers {{in their hair}} (or both). <b>The</b> <b>dress</b> <b>code</b> governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World WarI, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts {{a few inches from}} the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King GeorgeV was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King GeorgeVI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.|$|E
25|$|In Iran, where {{wearing the}} hijab is legally required, many women push the {{boundaries}} of <b>the</b> state-mandated <b>dress</b> <b>code,</b> risking a fine or a spell in detention.

25|$|The Ottoman Empire had {{a social}} {{system based on}} {{religious}} affiliation. The religious insignia extended to every social function. It was common to wear clothing that identified the person with their own particular religious grouping and accompanied headgear which distinguished rank and profession throughout the Ottoman Empire. The turbans, fezes, bonnets and head-dresses surmounting Ottoman styles showed the sex, rank, and profession (both civil and military) of the wearer. These styles were accompanied with a strict regulation beginning with the reign of Süleyman the Magnificent. Sultan Mahmud II followed on the example of Peter the Great in Russia in modernizing the Empire and used <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> <b>code</b> of 1826 which developed the symbols (classifications) of feudalism among the public. These reforms like that of Peter I of Russia or Sultan Mahmud II, was achieved through introduction of the progressive customs by decrees, while banning the traditional customs. The view of their social change proposed; if the permanence of secularism was to be assured by removal of persistence of traditional cultural values (the religious insignia), a considerable degree of cultural receptivity by the public to the further social change could be achieved. <b>The</b> <b>dress</b> <b>code</b> gave {{a chance for the}} removal of persistence of traditional values in the society.|$|E

25|$|Iran {{went from}} banning {{all types of}} veils in 1936 to {{restoring}} original dress code between 1980 and 1984. Practical decisions started with the Iranian Cultural Revolution in April 1980, when {{it was decided that}} women in government offices and educational institutions would observe the veil. The 1983 penal code prescribed punishment of 74 lashes for women appearing in public without Islamic hijab (hijab shar'ee), leaving the definition of proper hijab ambiguous. The same period witnessed tensions around the definition of proper hijab, which sometimes resulted in vigilante harassment of women who were perceived to wear improper clothing. The government felt obliged to address this situation, and in 1984 Tehran’s public prosecutor announced that a stricter dress-code should observed in public establishments, while clothing in other places should correspond to standards observed by the majority of the people. A new regulation issued in 1988 by the Ministry of the Interior based on the 1983 law further specified what constituted violations of hijab. Iran's current penal code stipulates a fine or 10 days to two months in prison as punishment for failure to observe hijab in public, without specifying its form. <b>The</b> <b>dress</b> <b>code</b> has been subject of alternating periods of relatively strict and relaxed enforcement over the years, with many women pushing its boundaries, and its compulsory aspect has been a point of contention between conservatives and the current president Hassan Rouhani. In governmental and religious institutions, <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> <b>code</b> requires khimar-type headscarf and overcoat, while in other public places women commonly wear a loosely tied headscarf (rousari). Iranian government endorses and officially promotes stricter types of veiling, praising it by invoking both Islamic religious principles and pre-Islamic Iranian culture.|$|E
25|$|A common {{version of}} Malaysian school uniform is of public schools. <b>The</b> <b>dress</b> <b>code</b> for males {{is the most}} {{standardised}} while female uniforms are more varied based on the religion of students {{and the type of}} schools. Male students are required to wear a collared shirt with a pair of shorts or long pants. Female students may wear a knee-length pinafore and a collared shirt, a knee-length skirt and a collared shirt, or a baju kurung consisting of a top and a long skirt with an optional hijab (tudung) for Muslim students. White socks and shoes of black or white are almost universally required for students, while ties are included in certain dress codes. Prefects and students with other additional school duties may wear uniforms of different colours; colours may differ between primary and secondary schools.|$|E
