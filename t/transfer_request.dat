5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1987–88 season, Whiteside {{represented}} the Football League in a game against the 'Rest of the World' to celebrate the league's centenary. He formed a solid partnership with Brian McClair, scoring 10 goals in 35 appearances, though United finished second in the league behind Liverpool, and he often found himself back in midfield or on the bench when Peter Davenport was selected to play alongside McClair. However, he felt that he was due a better contract, and decided to 'call the bluff' of the club by handing in a <b>transfer</b> <b>request.</b> Recovering from injury and abuse from some supporters for his <b>transfer</b> <b>request,</b> he put what many United fans call the best performance of his career at Anfield on 4 April 1988, when he came off a substitute with his team 3–1 down to help United to salvage a point.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 2007, it was {{announced}} that a bid from Sunderland had been accepted by Stoke, after Higginbotham had handed a <b>transfer</b> <b>request</b> to the club. Higginbotham wrote in his autobiography that Pulis would only authorise the deal if he handed in a <b>transfer</b> <b>request.</b> Higginbotham signed a four-year deal with Sunderland the following day, moving for a £2.5million fee, possibly rising to £3million dependent on appearances. He said that the chance to play Premier League football under Roy Keane was too good to refuse. On 10 November 2007, Higginbotham scored the opening goal for Sunderland which was believed to come off his ear in a 1–1 draw with their Tyne-Wear rivals Newcastle United at the Stadium of Light. He was only a bit-part player by the start of 2008–09, and Keane allowed him to return to Stoke for the same fee that he had paid to Stoke.|$|E

5|$|After Kaká and Ancelotti left Milan in {{the summer}} of 2009, Chelsea tested Milan's resolve by bidding $12 million and Claudio Pizarro for Pirlo. The club {{rejected}} the offer and Pirlo was said to be contemplating a <b>transfer</b> <b>request.</b> On 5 August, club owner Silvio Berlusconi decided not to sell Pirlo, who said he was overjoyed and wanted to end his career at Milan. On 21 October 2009, Pirlo scored a notable 30-metre goal in Milan's 3–2 win over Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League; Milan were eventually eliminated in the round of 16. Milan finished the season with a 3rd place in Serie A, and a quarter-final finish in the Coppa Italia under new manager Leonardo.|$|E
5|$|Baroš {{broke his}} ankle in a September 2003 match against Blackburn Rovers, a match which also saw {{teammate}} Jamie Carragher sustain a broken leg. Baroš subsequently missed {{five months of}} football and scored just two goals in the 2003–04 season. His first goal came in a league match against Leeds United in February 2004, while his other goal was in March in a 1–1 Champions League draw against Marseille. Baroš would later claim that had manager Gérard Houllier stayed at the club after the summer of 2004, he would have put in a <b>transfer</b> <b>request.</b> As it was, Houllier left the club {{and was replaced by}} Rafael Benítez.|$|E
5|$|Bonass {{came into}} the team at outside-right for the fifth game of the new season, before {{reverting}} to outside-left against Sheffield Wednesday on 17 September, which coincided with Chesterfield's first win. Two weeks later, he scored the only goal of the game at home to West Ham United direct from a corner kick. He kept his place {{to the end of}} the year, but then played only three times before the end of February when he submitted a <b>transfer</b> <b>request.</b> The Derbyshire Times reported no disharmony between club and player, who just felt that different surroundings might help a return to form. He moved on to London club Queens Park Rangers (QPR) in June, and played in all three of their matches before the 1939–40 Football League season was abandoned when war broke out.|$|E

5|$|Born in Manchester, Higginbotham {{started his}} career at his local club Manchester United. He made seven {{appearances}} at Old Trafford, winning the Intercontinental Cup, as well as having a loan spell with Belgian side Royal Antwerp before joining Derby County in order to play more matches. He spent three years at Derby but handed in a <b>transfer</b> <b>request</b> when the club was relegated from the Premier League. Southampton signed Higginbotham for a £1.5million fee in February 2003, and he helped them reach the 2003 FA Cup Final. When Southampton were relegated in 2005, Higginbotham rejected a new contract and {{was placed on the}} transfer list.|$|E
5|$|Allardyce {{was offered}} a {{contract}} by Norwich City manager John Bond, but the offer was bettered by Colin Addison at Derby County, and he verbally agreed a three-year contract with Derby. However, before signing the contract he received a late offer from Ken Knighton to play for Sunderland on a £300 a week contract with a £20,000 signing on fee – which more than quadrupled his wage at Bolton. Knighton appointed him as club captain. However Allardyce soon wearied of the long-distance travel from Sunderland {{to his home in}} Bolton, and put in a <b>transfer</b> <b>request</b> when chairman Tom Cowie refused to help finance the purchase of a home in Sunderland. Cowie sacked Knighton late in the 1980–81 season, leaving caretaker manager Mick Docherty in charge to steer the club out of the First Division relegation zone. New manager Alan Durban left Allardyce out of the team {{at the start of the}} 1981–82 campaign, leaving Allardyce's departure from Roker Park inevitable.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1926–27 season, the {{departure}} of club captain Jimmy Blair saw Keenor appointed the new captain of the Bluebirds and he led the team to a second FA Cup final in 1927. However Keenor came close to never playing in the match as, having been struggling to hold down a first team place due to injury, he handed in a <b>transfer</b> <b>request</b> in January 1927 but a proposed move to Severnside rivals Bristol Rovers later collapsed. Instead, he returned to the starting eleven that beat Arsenal 1–0 with a goal from Hughie Ferguson, being praised for his leadership of the team's defence during the match and earning plaudits from opposing captain Charlie Buchan. By winning the trophy, Cardiff had become the first team outside England to win the FA Cup and Keenor, as captain, was handed the trophy by King George V.|$|E

5|$|Banks {{started the}} 1964–65 season on wages of £40 a week, {{and the club}} only agreed to pay £60 a week in December. These miserly wages made it {{difficult}} for the club to spend the £80,000 it received from the sale of Frank McLintock – he had put in a <b>transfer</b> <b>request</b> over dissatisfaction with his pay and quality replacements were reluctant to join a club that paid full internationals like Banks and McLintock no more than the base rate that rival clubs paid to average players. Leicester finished 18th in the league and were knocked out of the FA Cup by Liverpool at Anfield in the sixth round. In the League Cup, City struggled to get past Peterborough United (in a replay), Grimsby Town and Crystal Palace (in a replay), before they recorded an 8–1 victory over Coventry City at Highfield Road. After easing past Plymouth Argyle in the semi-finals, Banks found himself playing in another League Cup final. However Chelsea won the final after successfully defending their 3–2 win at Stamford Bridge with a goalless draw at Filbert Street.|$|E
5|$|Given {{started his}} career at Celtic, however he never made a first-team {{appearance}} and he was released and signed by Blackburn Rovers on a free transfer in 1994. Given was part of both the Sunderland team who won the Football League First Division title in 1995–96 and the Swindon Town team who won the Football League Second Division title that same season, while on loan from Blackburn Rovers. He was signed by Newcastle United in 1997 for a fee of £1.5million, {{and it was there}} that he began competing to be a first-choice Premier League goalkeeper. Given was part of the teams who came runners-up in the 1998 and 1999 FA Cup campaigns, and was named in the Premier League Team of the Season for 2001–02 and 2005–06. He played in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup with Newcastle, and was involved in the club's title challenge in 2001–02. Although he submitted a <b>transfer</b> <b>request</b> during the 2000–01 campaign after losing his position in the starting line-up, it was denied, and Given went on to regain his place.|$|E
5|$|He joined fellow Championship side Stoke City for a £225,000 fee in August 2006. He {{was made}} captain when Michael Duberry left in January 2007 and Stoke {{went on to}} {{narrowly}} miss out on a play-off place. With Stoke not being promoted Higginbotham again decided to hand in a <b>transfer</b> <b>request</b> to help force through a move to Sunderland. He spent one season at the Stadium of Light before returning to Stoke in 2008. He became a vital member of Tony Pulis' squad as Stoke established themselves in the Premier League. He scored the winning goal in the FA Cup quarter-final against West Ham United but missed out on both the semi-final and the final due to a knee injury. After his recovery he struggled to force his {{way back into the}} side and spent time out on loan to Nottingham Forest and Ipswich Town before joining Sheffield United on a free transfer in January 2013. After eight months at Bramall Lane, he left to join Conference Premier side Chester before ending his career with a short spell at Altrincham.|$|E
50|$|In May 2016, Banco del Austro (BDA) in Ecuador sued Wells Fargo after Wells Fargo honored $12 {{million in}} fund <b>transfer</b> <b>requests</b> {{that had been}} placed by thieves. In this case, the thieves sent SWIFT {{messages}} that resembled recently canceled <b>transfer</b> <b>requests</b> from BDA, with slightly altered amounts; the reports do not detail how the thieves gained access to send the SWIFT messages. BDA asserts that Wells Fargo should have detected the suspicious SWIFT messages, which were placed outside of normal BDA working hours and were of an unusual size. Wells Fargo claims that BDA {{is responsible for the}} loss, as the thieves gained access to the legitimate SWIFT credentials of a BDA employee and sent fully authenticated SWIFT messages.|$|R
50|$|The attacks {{exploited}} vulnerabilities in {{the systems}} of member banks, allowing the attackers {{to gain control}} of the banks' legitimate SWIFT credentials.

5|$|In July 1945, Lawton handed in a <b>transfer</b> <b>request</b> at Everton as {{he wanted}} a move to a Southern club so as {{to see more of}} his {{increasingly}} estranged wife. In November 1945, he was sold to Chelsea for a fee of £14,000. Chelsea continued to play regional wartime fixtures as national league football had not resumed for the 1945–46 season, and Lawton also continued his uncapped appearances for the England national team. In the summer of 1946, following his demobilisation, he coached for the FA in a summer camp in Switzerland. He scored a club record 26 goals in 34 league games in the 1946–47 season. However he struggled to settle at Stamford Bridge and came into conflict with manager Billy Birrell after refusing to go on a pre-season tour of Sweden in 1947, which resulted in him requesting a transfer. He favoured a move to Arsenal, but this was ruled out by the Chelsea hierarchy. Lawton turned down an approach by Sunderland manager Bill Murray as he held out hope that Chelsea would relent and allow him a move to Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|In November 1949 {{he joined}} Second Division club Hull City for a {{transfer}} fee of £19,000. He chose {{to join the}} Tigers ahead of bigger clubs like Arsenal and Manchester City who had shown interest in signing him {{due to the fact}} that Hull were managed by Raich Carter, who had been a great player before and after World War II. Carter did improve Revie's game but was not a success as Hull manager, as City finished mid-table in 1949–50 and 1950–51, before becoming involved in a relegation battle in 1951–52. Teammate Andy Davidson later said Revie failed to fulfil his potential at Boothferry Park as he was not a tough player, and the rest of the Hull team were not physically dominant enough to protect him and allow him to dictate play with his accurate passing. As at Leicester, Revie felt the time had come for him to move on and handed in a <b>transfer</b> <b>request</b> once Carter departed.|$|E
5|$|On 27 January 2011, Torres was {{the subject}} of a £40million bid from Chelsea, which was {{rejected}} by Liverpool. He subsequently handed in an official <b>transfer</b> <b>request</b> to Liverpool the next day, which was rejected. Torres completed his move to Chelsea on a five-and-a-half-year contract on 31 January 2011 for an undisclosed fee reported to be £50million, which set a new record for a British transfer and made him the sixth most expensive footballer in history. He made his Chelsea debut on 6 February 2011 in a 1–0 home defeat to former club Liverpool. On 23 April 2011, Torres scored his first goal for Chelsea against West Ham United in a 3–0 victory, which ended a run of 903 minutes of football without a goal. This was his only goal for Chelsea in the 2010–11 season, having made 18 appearances for his new club.|$|E

5|$|Sidelined for a period, {{recovering}} from a hernia operation, Swan {{spent much of the}} 1993–94 pre-season making visits to the local children's hospital as he was moved by the patients he met there, particularly by a small girl called Lisa who died later that summer. Once he made it back onto the training field he had a small fight with teammate Bernie Slaven, though rumours that spread through Stoke-on-Trent that this was due to him having an affair with Slaven's wife were false. As Rudge built a solid team the club earned automatic promotion, with Swan being a vital contributor to this success. However, by October Swan fancied a new club and a new challenge, and so handed in a <b>transfer</b> <b>request.</b> In July 1994 he was sold on to Peter Shilton's Plymouth Argyle for a fee of £300,000, then a Plymouth record. This was despite Vale's valuation of £350,000 and reported interest from Burnley, and from First Division club's Bolton Wanderers, Leicester City, Notts County, and West Brom.|$|E
5|$|Wolves enjoyed an {{excellent}} {{start to the}} 1969–70 season, winning seven of their opening eight games, but fell away to a mid-table finish after the shock retirement of 24-year old forward Peter Knowles, who left the game to become a full-time Jehovah's Witness volunteer. Dougan had a poor season, limited to just ten goals in 33 games due to injuries and an eight-week suspension for verbally abusing a linesman in a home defeat to Everton. In the return fixture at Goodison Park, he suffered a clash of heads with full-back Keith Newton and had to undergo major re-constructive surgery and was out of action for two months. McGarry did not speak to Dougan during his two-month absence, but Dougan decided against issuing a <b>transfer</b> <b>request</b> as {{he did not want}} to further his reputation as a journeyman player.|$|E
5|$|Wormull helped Stevenage {{to reach}} {{the final of the}} FA Trophy in 2002, which they lost 2–0 to {{full-time}} professional club Yeovil Town. While with the club he won his seventh international cap, and maintained his reputation as a good crosser of the ball who was willing to shoot; in his first two seasons with the club he contributed more shots than any of his teammates, and in his second and third seasons he made most assists. Stevenage began to move towards full-time status before the 2002–03 season. At the end of that season, Wormull submitted a <b>transfer</b> <b>request,</b> because he was struggling to balance work and football commitments. Manager Graham Westley rejected the request, but in April 2004 his contract was cancelled by mutual consent, citing the player's injury record and his difficulties adjusting to the demands of full-time football.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Dynamic optical {{networks}} {{hold the}} potential of satisfying very large bandwidth requirements {{of many of the}} Grid applications. However, encapsulation of optical network elements into manageable Grid resources and dynamic provisioning of lightpaths is necessary to meet the complex demand patterns of the Grid applications and to optimize usage of optical network components. In this paper, we first present a scalable algorithm for an NP-Hard problem of scheduling ondemand and advance reservation requests for lightpaths. We then investigate in detail the effect of proportion of advance reservations, laxity and distribution of the size of data <b>transfer</b> <b>requests</b> on performance through extensive experimentation. The paper also investigates that how much improvement in performance can be gained by segmenting large data <b>transfer</b> <b>requests</b> into multiple requests of smaller sizes and up to what percentage of overheads is segmentation justified in scheduling of lightpaths.
