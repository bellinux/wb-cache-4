50|$|Yangon has a 4456 km {{road network}} {{of all types}} (<b>tar,</b> <b>concrete</b> and dirt) in March 2011. Many of the roads are in poor {{condition}} and not wide enough to accommodate {{an increasing number of}} cars. The vast majority of Yangon residents cannot afford a car and rely on an extensive network of buses to get around. Over 300 public and private bus lines operate about 6,300 crowded buses around the city, carrying over 4.4 million passengers a day. All buses and 80% of the taxis in Yangon run on compressed natural gas (CNG), following the 2005 government decree to save money on imported petroleum. Highway buses to other cities depart from Dagon Ayeyar Highway Bus Terminal for Irrawaddy delta region and Aung Mingala Highway Bus Terminal for other parts of the country.|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{the effects}} of jet fuel {{spillage}} on samples of bituminous concrete pavements are reported. Test samples were made from binders of asphalt, tar and blends of asphalt and tar. All binders were rubberized by adding varying quantities of nitrile, styrene and natural rubber. Changes in Marshall stability and flow values resulting from exposure to fuel were measured, relative to unexposed control specimens. <b>Tar</b> <b>concrete</b> mixes proved to be the most resistant to jet fuel attack, while the temperature history of the test specimens was shown to be an important factor. Measured glass transition temperatures obtained from DTA studies of some of the blended binders gave evidence that the blends were physical, or two-phase. The results of this study give quantitative support to the observed behaviour of prototype bituminous pavements subjected to jet fuel spillage...|$|E
40|$|As a rule, motor {{roads are}} {{composed}} of the subgrade and the road dressing. Road dressing is composed of the road pavement, road base and the bottoming. Road dressing may be non-rigid (or made of coarse asphalt concrete, fine asphalt concrete, <b>tar</b> <b>concrete,</b> rubble or gravel treated by binding agents, etc.) and rigid (asphalt concrete road pavements resting on the road base made of cement concrete, or prefabricated pavements made of reinforced concrete and ferrocement slabs, monolithic cement concrete pavements). Cement concrete roads are five to six times more durable than asphalt concrete roads; their service life may exceed 50 years. They are resistant to environmental attacks; they ensure excellent grip of the wheel, and they are dust-free. Their road pavement is resistant to wear (0. 1 mm per year); its thickness does not exceed 16 - 22 mm. Therefore, effective concrete road pavements require self-compacting though non-segregating concrete mixtures {{to comply with the}} pre-set values of their properties, namely, bending and compressive strength, corrosion resistance, freeze resistance, etc. Acting in cooperation with Department of Technology of Binders and Concretes of MSUCE, NIIMosstroy developed and examined a self-compacting cast concrete mixture designated for durable monolithic road pavements. The composition in question was generated by adding a multi-component modifier into the mix. The modifier was composed of a hyperplasticiser, active (structureless) fine and crystalline silica, and a concrete hardening control agent...|$|E

40|$|The report {{enclosed}} herewith relates the construction history and interim performance of an experimental pavement in which coal tar (RT- 12) was substituted for asphalt cement (PAC- 5) ··all other design features were basically similar to asphaltic concrete paving projects abutting {{each end of}} the experimental section. The resulting tar mixtures were in general conformity with Mixes 4 T {base) and 7 T (surface) of ASTM D 1753 - 67. Although the Marshall stability was 3000 pounds at I 00 °F, the tar surface course has thinned in the wheel tracks and thickened outside the wheel paths. Tar mixes have insufficient strength to withstand testing at 140 °F. The greater. sensitivity of the tar to summer temperatures [...] together with very heavy wheel loads �- suffice to explain the greater rutting occurring in the tar surface than in the asphalt sections. Only the heavy wheel loads were unanticipated. Deflection measurements indicate that the <b>tar</b> <b>concrete</b> pavement is otherwise comparable to the two asphaltic concrete pavements abutting thereto. Leveling of the existing surface, together with an insulating overlay of asphaltic concrete, should restore the pavement to normal service capabilities. Whereas the report indicates that 4. 5 inches would be needed to restore the pavement to the original 20 -year design, I would recommend a 2. 5 -inch overlay (plus. 5 -inch allowance for leveling) at this time [...] thereby deferring the remaining 2 inches until a mor...|$|E

Fe 2 O 3 {{is the most}} popular red mineral pigment which is used largely in traditional ceramics, <b>tar</b> and <b>concrete.</b> The compounds were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning transmission electronic microscopy (energy dispersive X-ray cartography), Mössbauer spectroscopy, magnetic investigations versus temperature and visible-NIR spectroscopy. Both 57 Fe and 119 Sn Mössbauer analyses combined with rietveld XRD refinements are the ideal techniques to characterize tin-iron oxides.

40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to the School of Technology University of Wolverhampton in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Doctor of PhilosophyThe deficiency of sub-Saharan Africa urban land use planning regimes has received extensive discussion in the literature. As yet, little is known of the extent and magnitude of {{the economic impact of}} these planning regimes on the economic wellbeing of individuals and the society. This situation is further compounded by the lack of simplified and bespoke methodologies for calibrating economic impacts of planning policies even in the developed world where there are relatively huge volumes of organised data. This study aims to prescribe a simplified quantitative methodology, which is subsequently employed to gauge the economic impacts of these regimes. It proceeds on the central argument that planning regimes in the sub-region are weak with low compliance with planning regulations, partly because they do not provide incentives for property owners/developers/land users. The study adopts a cross-sectional survey strategywith questionnaires and administrative data extraction to procure the requisite data from Accra, Ghana to feed the devised methodological framework. The study establishes that Ghana’s urban land use planning regime, in its current form, imposes huge cost on residential property owners compared to its benefits; it creates a disincentive for property owners. A substantial amount of this cost emanates from pipe-borne water, and <b>tarred</b> roads and <b>concrete</b> drain infrastructural facilities. It is further established that the cost of title formalisation requirement constitutes a huge portion of the cost on express requirements under the planning regime. A major portion of this cost results from the cost other than official fees. However, on individual basis the requirement generates marginal net benefit. Incidental costs for the other express requirements, architectural design and building permit are also substantial. In terms of benefits, <b>tarred</b> roads and <b>concrete</b> drains, formalised title, electricity and pipe-borne water, individually, are found to generate the most benefits under the planning regime. The study makes a number of recommendations. These include formulation of planning policies on the basis of providing incentives to property owners/developer/land users, strategies for reduction of infrastructural and amenities costs, as well as incidental cost relating to compliance with the subject planning regime express requirements...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{vegetation}} {{has been}} converted to land uses, such as agriculture, commercial forestry and urban use, to meet increasing human demands for food, fuel and shelter. These land use changes modify the surface conditions of an area, resulting in changes in hydrological responses. Urban land use, in particular, has {{a significant impact on}} catchment hydrology {{as a result of the}} increased impervious areas such as <b>concrete,</b> <b>tar</b> and roofs. To assess the future hydrological impacts of urban land use, the scale and location of future urban areas must be considered. The objective of this study was to assess the hydrological responses to future urban growth in the Mgeni catchment, South Africa. An urban growth model was used to generate scenarios of plausible future urban growth and these scenarios were modelled using a hydrological model to determine the hydrological responses to urban growth. The plausible future urban growth in the Mgeni catchment was modelled using the SLEUTH Urban Growth model (SLEUTH). The SLEUTH acronym stands for the input layers required for the model viz. Slope, Land use, Excluded areas, Urban Extent, Transport routes and Hillshade. SLEUTH is able to provide the scale and location of future urban growth require...|$|R
40|$|The {{urban land}} use {{planning}} literature is rife with criticism of the deficiency of planning regimes in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, little is known {{of the magnitude of}} the economic impact of these {{land use planning}} regimes, leading to a lack of clear evidence to direct policy reforms. This study examines the economic benefit of Ghana’s land use planning regime to provide quantitative evidence of the magnitude of its benefits to contribute to the debate in the literature as well as aid policy formulation. This study found that land use planning in Ghana contributes considerable benefits in residential areas. A substantial portion of these benefits emanates from <b>tarred</b> roads and <b>concrete</b> drains, electricity, formalized titles and pipe-borne water, while worship centres generate no benefits. This implies that the former four attributes are central to generating maximum benefits from planning in residential areas in Ghana. The study recommends that Ghana’s ongoing planning reforms should place the provision of these facilities at the heart of residential neighbourhood developments, while steps are taken to review the necessity of requirements (attributes) such as community parks, schools and worship centres in residential communities. To aid the assessment of the suitability of land use planning requirements, it is further suggested that the benefit of the planning regime should be evaluated {{in the context of the}} cost of compliance with its requirements and urban dwellers’ socio-economic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (DTech. {{degree in}} Mathematics and Statistics) Tshwane University of TechnologyFor decades, the {{development}} of rhythmic corrugations on untarred roads has fascinated road engineers and technicians and even travellers. Numerous researchers have proposed theories about the formation and movement of these corrugations. Automobile tyres are essentially designed for use on <b>tarred</b> or <b>concrete</b> road surfaces. However, these tyres are also used on dirt roads, which often develop corrugations {{as a result of}} the interaction between the vehicle and dry road surfaces. Designing a tyre suited to corrugated dirt road conditions would be advantageous for rural inhabitants as well as the economy of a country. The aim of this research is to investigate the tangential oscillation of the vehicle tyre’s tread surface when the tyre strikes an obstacle in the road and the effect of this tangential oscillation on the formation of corrugations. A theoretical analysis of the nature and frequency of the tangential oscillation of the tread surface of the rubber tyre was done. A mathematical model (torsional oscillator model) of the tangential oscillations of the rubber tyre’s tread surface was proposed, in the form of an ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. To verify this model, static experiments were performed on a wheel with a rigid, stationary axle. Dynamic experiments were then carried out on the tyre of a vehicle. It was found that, when a vehicle is travelling a corrugated dirt road and an obstacle (such as a corrugation) is struck in the road, the tread surface of the rubber tyre will oscillate tangentially. A second theoretical model, the forced telegraph equation model, in the form of a partial differential equation, was also proposed. Correlation between the graphs of the two models was evident. The experiments and observations in this research are consistent with the hypothesis that corrugations are formed, at least partially by the tangential oscillation of the vehicle tyre’s tread surface. It is suggested that, to minimize the formation of dirt road corrugations, the design of tyres must take into account the tangential oscillation of the rubber tyre’s tread surface. If the tangential oscillation of the tyres’ tread surface can be effectively damped, their tendency to generate corrugations might be reduced...|$|R
