5|$|One final {{suggestion}} for political policy reform {{is the notion}} that <b>there</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> political balance in every branch of public service. Lack of balance in public institutions creates havens for reactionary forces, which in turn undermine democracy. Russell emphasises two conditions necessary for the achievement of balance. He advocates, first, the abolition of the legal standing of confessions as evidence, to remove the incentive for extraction of confession under torture by the police (Russell 1938:232). Second, the creation of dual branches of police to investigate particular crimes: one which presumes the innocence of the accused, the other presuming guilt (Russell 1938:233).|$|E

2500|$|The {{position}} of Richard Owen was unknown: when emphasising to a Parliamentary committee {{the need for}} a new Natural History museum, he pointed out that [...] "The whole intellectual world this year has been excited by a book on the origin of species; and what is the consequence? Visitors come to the British Museum, and they say, 'Let us see all these varieties of pigeons: where is the tumbler, where is the pouter?' and I am obliged with shame to say, I can show you none of them..." [...] As to showing you the varieties of those species, or of any of those phenomena that would aid one in getting at that mystery of mysteries, the origin of species, our space does not permit; but surely <b>there</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> space somewhere, and, if not in the British Museum, where is it to be obtained?" ...|$|E

2500|$|A minor of a graph G is any graph H that is {{isomorphic}} to a graph {{that can}} be obtained from a subgraph of G by contracting some edges. [...] If G does not have a graph H as a minor, then we say that G is [...] H-free. Let H be a fixed graph. Intuitively, if G is a huge H-free graph, then <b>there</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> [...] "good reason" [...] for this. [...] The graph structure theorem provides such a [...] "good reason" [...] {{in the form of a}} rough description of the structure of G. [...] In essence, every H-free graph G suffers from one of two structural deficiencies: either G is [...] "too thin" [...] to have H as a minor, or G can be (almost) topologically embedded on a surface that is too simple to embed H upon. [...] The first reason applies if H is a planar graph, and both reasons apply if H is not planar. [...] We first make precise these notions.|$|E
2500|$|Sinn Féin {{has been}} {{considered}} to be Eurosceptic. The party campaigned for a [...] "No" [...] vote in the Irish referendum on joining the European Economic Community in 1972,. Sinn Fein was {{on the same side}} of the debate as the DUP and most of the UUP in that they wanted to pull out when UK had its referendum in 1975. [...] The party was critical of the supposed need for an EU constitution as proposed in 2002, and urged a [...] "No" [...] vote in the 2008 referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, although Mary Lou McDonald said that there [...] was [...] "no contradiction in being pro-Europe but anti-treaty." [...] In its manifesto for the 2015 UK general election, Sinn Féin pledged that the party would campaign for the UK to stay within the European Union (EU), Martin McGuinness saying that an exit [...] "would be absolutely economically disastrous". Gerry Adams said that, if there were to be a referendum on the question, <b>there</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> separate and binding referendum for Northern Ireland. Its policy of a [...] "Europe of Equals", and its critical engagement after 2001, together with its engagement with the European Parliament, marks a change from the party's previous opposition to the EU. The party expresses, on one hand, [...] "support for Europe-wide measures that promote and enhance human rights, equality and the all-Ireland agenda", and on the other a [...] "principled opposition" [...] to a European superstate.|$|E
