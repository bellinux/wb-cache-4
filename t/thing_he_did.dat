25|$|Shortly after Moreira married Vicenta, his {{troubles}} began. The Deputy Mayor of the area, known as Don Francisco, had also {{fallen in love}} with La Vicenta, so as a form of vengeance he began charging Moreira fines for everything he could think of, real or imaginary. The first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> was charge Moreira 500 pesos for having his wedding celebration without proper authorization.|$|E
25|$|His {{adoptive father}} was a {{hard-working}} coal miner, but the family still had trouble making ends meet. Gavin quit school after eighth grade and became a full-time clerk at a shoe store for $12.50 a week. His next stint was as a manager for Jewel Oil Company. A combination of restlessness and limited future opportunities in his hometown caused Gavin {{to run away from}} home. In March 1924, on his 17th birthday, he took the night train to New York. The first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> upon arriving was to send a telegram to his parents saying everything was all right to prevent them from reporting him missing to the police. After that, he started looking for a job.|$|E
25|$|In 1875, he {{was named}} Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford and in 1876 assumed the new Chair of Chinese Language and Literature at Oxford, where he {{attracted}} few students to his lectures but worked hard for some 20 years in his study at 3 Keble Terrace, on his translations of the Chinese classics. According to an anonymous contemporary obituary in the Pall Mall Gazette, Legge was in his study every morning at three o'clock, winter and summer, having retired to bed at ten. When he {{got up in the}} morning the first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> was to make himself a cup of tea over a spirit-lamp. Then he worked away at his translations while all the household slept.|$|E

25|$|Accounts differ as to {{the next}} {{sequence}} of events. After the collision, Lifsh said that the first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{was to try to}} lift the car in order to free the two children beneath it. The EMS unit that arrived on the scene about three minutes after the accident said that Lifsh was being beaten and pulled out of the station wagon by three or four men. A volunteer ambulance from the Hatzolah ambulance corps arrived on the scene at about 8:23pm, followed by police and a City ambulance, which took Gavin Cato to Kings County Hospital, arriving at 8:32pm; Cato was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. Volunteers from a second Hatzolah ambulance helped Angela Cato, until a second City ambulance arrived and took her to the same hospital.|$|E

500|$|After leaving {{school with}} A-levels in English, History and Economics, Dickinson confessed, [...] "I didn't {{really know what}} I wanted to do." [...] The first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> was join the Territorial Army for six months. Although he enjoyed {{his time in the}} TA, Dickinson {{realised}} {{that it was not a}} career choice, and so he applied for a place to read history at Queen Mary College, London. His parents wanted him in the army, but he told them that he wanted to get a degree first, which acted as his [...] "cover story", and immediately began playing in bands.|$|E

500|$|Before the [...] season, Ellis {{publicly}} criticized Yankees owner George Steinbrenner {{for giving}} him a raise that was inadequate given his 1976 performance and for interfering with manager Billy Martin. As Ellis refused to sign his contract, and the Yankees {{did not want to}} have players who could become free agents, the Yankees traded Ellis with Larry Murray and Marty Perez to the Oakland Athletics for Mike Torrez in April 1977. Torrez emerged as a top starting pitcher for the Yankees that season, while Ellis struggled. While pitching for Oakland, the team asked him to keep charts. Defiant, Ellis set the charts on fire in the clubhouse, setting off sprinklers. Ellis ranked this as the [...] "craziest" [...] <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> during his career.|$|E
500|$|Drake {{ended his}} studies at Cambridge nine months before graduation, and in autumn 1969 moved to London. His father remembered [...] "writing him long letters, {{pointing}} out the disadvantages of going away from Cambridge... a degree was a safety net, if you manage to get a degree, at least {{you have something to}} fall back on; his reply to that was that a safety net was the one <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want." [...] Drake spent his first few months in the capital drifting from place to place, occasionally staying at his sister's Kensington flat, but usually sleeping on friends’ sofas and floors. Eventually, in an attempt to bring some stability and a telephone into Drake's life, Boyd organised and paid for a ground floor bedsit in Belsize Park, Camden.|$|E
500|$|... "Radio Bart" [...] {{was written}} by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza, though series creator Matt Groening {{came up with the}} idea for it. The episode was based on the 1951 film Ace in the Hole, which sees the story of a down-and-out journalist exploiting a story about a man trapped in a cave to re-jump start his career. Vitti did not watch the film until after the episode had been written; [...] " [...] came in out of nowhere and just gave me, start to finish, the whole story." [...] Vitti said renting the film was the first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> after finishing the script. He remarked, [...] "It's surprisingly hard to rent. It's really dark and funny and it's by Billy Wilder, so you think it would be in stores, but it's not. It was hard to find." ...|$|E

500|$|As Edgeworth {{had been}} a popular {{character}} ever since start of the series, Takumi {{found it difficult to}} come up with a way to bring him back without having him, a supposedly great prosecutor, always lose to Phoenix. While he was writing the story for the game's final case, he thought of the idea to have Edgeworth become a player character; he liked this idea so much that he immediately started to rewrite the case. In order to allow Edgeworth to be the player character, the first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> was to [...] "get rid of" [...] Phoenix by having him fall from a bridge into an icy river. He enjoyed writing from another character's perspective, who thought differently from Phoenix; he also used the case to explore the relationship between Edgeworth and Gumshoe. One of the game's episodes had originally been written for Justice for All: it had been intended as the fourth episode of Justice for All, but was cut due to memory limiations, and ended up being reused as the third episode of Trials and Tribulations.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson {{spent the}} {{majority}} of the 2003 season on the disabled list and was ineffective in the few injury-hampered starts he did make. One <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> accomplish that year was hitting his first career home run in a September 19, 2003 game against the Milwaukee Brewers. It was the only home run to date for Johnson, a career [...]125 hitter.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Glenn Chugg {{was born}} on 15 June 1947 in Launceston to Victor Chugg and Lorna (née Hancock). Chugg was the eldest of four children, while his grandmother, Ella Chugg, was his [...] "best friend". He credits his {{great-grandfather}} with his idiosyncratic use of profanity [...] "the first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> was taught me to swear. And it's always been {{a major part of}} my delivery of things. There might have been one or two instance over the 40 years where I was probably out of order but in the main it's usually been because it needed to be done". He attended Glen Dhu Primary School and then Queechy High School.|$|E
2500|$|... "Just imagine Mayor Emanuel had {{released}} the video in, say, November —without {{being forced to}} by a lawsuit.... But of course, he didn't do the right thing. He buried the video. He allowed officials to mislead the public. He hid the tapes because most likely he [...] assumed it would hurt his reelection campaign. Thus he {{not only did the}} immoral <b>thing,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> the politically stupid thing. Cook County state's attorney Anita Alvarez probably would've quickly responded with an indictment—just like she did earlier this week, when the tape actually was released. I mean, it's really hard to look at that tape and not call for an indictment. If the mayor had done that, he wouldn't be the villain in this sordid story. He'd be the hero. Or at least the guy who finally, for once in his life, did the right thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Frank Miller {{expanded}} most of Daredevil's abilities, {{he attempted}} to make them [...] "extraordinary enough to be exciting, but not on par with Superman", noting Superman's distinctly unbelievable powers. When Miller joined the title in 1979, the first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> to the character was [...] "revamp" [...] his radar sense and made it less distinct and more believable; he wanted Daredevil to have the [...] "proximity" [...] sense that some martial artists claim to have. Due to the character's sensitive sense of touch, Daredevil can read by passing his fingers over the letters on a page though laminated pages prevent him from reading the ink. Daredevil has commonly used his superhuman hearing {{to serve as a}} polygraph for interrogation by listening for changes in a person's heartbeat. This ability can be fooled if the other person's heart is not beating at a natural rate, such as if they have an artificial pacemaker.|$|E

2500|$|Joseph Paxton {{was first}} and {{foremost}} a gardener, and his layout of gardens, fountains, terraces and cascades left no doubt as to his ability. One <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> have a problem with was water supply. Such was his enthusiasm that thousands of gallons of water were needed to feed the myriad fountains and cascades abounding in the Park: the two main jets were [...] high. [...] Water towers were duly constructed, but the weight of water in the raised tanks caused them to collapse. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was consulted and came up with plans for two mighty water towers, one {{at the north end of}} the building and one at the south. Each supported a tremendous load of water, which was gathered from three reservoirs, at either end of and in the middle of the park. The grand fountains and cascades were opened, again in the presence of the Queen, who got wet when a gust of wind swept mists of spray over the royal carriage.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} notable ways was {{demonstrated}} in the 1992 Olympics, when the Dream Team, including Jordan and Pippen, took on Croatia for the gold medal. The Croatia team featured Toni Kukoč, a young star whom Krause had discovered through European contacts and was courting {{to a degree that}} some of the Bulls found annoying. Jordan biographer David Halberstam said that Jordan and Pippen [...] "seemed to play against Kukoc as if they had a vendetta", and that [...] "in the end, {{it was as if they}} had been playing not against Kukoc but against Krause." [...] Jordan would later be quoted as saying: [...] "The trade of Oakley was good, and the best <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> was to get Pippen and Grant. That's it. His claim to fame is that he drafted Earl Monroe for the Bullets. And I say to him, 'What pick was that?' He says, 'Two.' And I say, 'Hell! Earl Monroe was a real secret, huh? A real secret? If you hadn't taken him, he'd have gone third!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Uchikoshi {{prioritized}} storylines over characters, {{and used}} the feeling of discomfort {{as the foundation of}} the narrative. He first came up with a setting, and then made characters along with the drama and stories behind them. After this, he decided on the core of the game's story, and created a flowchart based on it, which became the [...] "bone structure of the story". According to Uchikoshi, it did not matter that the setups of the games were far-fetched, as long as their internal logic worked; he said {{that as long as the}} story is interesting and immersive, implausible situations feel plausible to the player. On the other hand, he felt that if he had specifically tried to make it more plausible, by forcing explanations that justify the situations, the story would become boring and the implausible would look even more implausible. Instead, he chose to rely on players' imagination, saying that players can make things seem plausible in ways he had not even imagined himself. One <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> to make the stories more believable was adding concepts such as Schrödinger's cat, which he felt added flavor and kept players wondering whether a particular concept could be the main idea of the game; he felt that when players wonder that, it makes the story feel more real, as they create the game world in their minds.|$|E
