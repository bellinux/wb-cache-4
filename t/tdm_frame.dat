40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} multiwavelength wavelength-routing networks {{operating in}} circuit-switched mode. Wavelength utiliza-tion is poor in such networks if sessions require {{only a fraction}} of a wavelength’s capacity. An all-optical approach to improve wavelength utilization is to use time division multiplexing (TDM) on each wavelength, and switch time slots and wavelengths. In this paper, we address the off-line multirate session scheduling problem, i. e., the problem of assigning time slots and wavelengths to a given static set of multirate sessions, in ring topologies. Given a set of sessions and their relative rates, our objective is to maximize network throughput. This objective translates to the problem of minimizing the maximum length of a <b>TDM</b> <b>frame</b> over all wavelengths. We first show that the off-line single-rate session scheduling problem is equivalent to the off-line wavelength assignment problem, and hence obtain bounds on frame length.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} routing and {{wavelength}} assignment {{problem for a}} circuit-switched time division multiplexed (TDM) wavelength-routed (WR) optical WDM network. In a conventional wavelength routed network, an entire wavelength is assigned to a given session (or circuit). This can lead to lower channel utilization when the individual sessions do not need the entire channel bandwidth. This paper considers a TDM-based approach to reduce this inefficiency. In this network architecture, each individual wavelength is partitioned in the time-domain into fixed-length time-slots organized as a <b>TDM</b> <b>frame.</b> Multiple sessions are multiplexed on each wavelength by assigning a sub-set of the TDM slots to each session. Thus, given a session request with a specified bandwidth, {{the goal is to}} determine the route, wavelength and time-slot assignment (RWTA) that meets the given request. This is similar to the routing and wavelength assignment problem studied for WR networks. In this paper, we present a family of RWTA algorithms and study the resulting blocking performance. For routing, we use the existing shortest-path routing algorithm with a new link cost function called least resistance weight function (LRW), that incorporates wavelength utilization information. For wavelength assignment, we employ the known least loaded (LL) wavelength selection; and for time-slot allocation, we present the leastloaded time-slot (LLT) algorithm with three different variations. Simulation based analyses are used to compare the proposed TDM architecture to traditional wavelength-routed networks, both with and without wavelength conversion.

5000|$|After {{the control}} word comes the TDMoIP payload. For structure-agnostic {{transport}} (SAToP) {{this is simply}} a predetermined number of TDM octets, while for the structure-locked format the payload is an integer number of <b>TDM</b> <b>frames.</b> For structure-indication and structure-reassembly TDMoIP draws on proven adaptation mechanisms originally developed for ATM. A side benefit of this choice of payload types is simplified interworking with circuit emulation services carried over ATM networks. For statically allocated, constant bit-rate (CBR) TDM links, TDMoIP employs ATM adaptation layer 1 (AAL1). This mechanism, defined in ITU-T standard I.363.1 and ATM Forum specification atm-vtoa-0078, was developed for carrying CBR services over ATM. AAL1 operates by segmenting the continuous stream of TDM data into small 48-byte cells and inserting sequencing, timing, error recovery, and synchronization information into them. TDMoIP allows concatenation of any number of AAL1 cells into a packet (note that these are AAL1 cells and not ATM cells, i.e. they {{do not include the}} five-byte [...] "cell tax"). By allowing multiple cells per packet, TDMoIP facilitates flexible tradeoffs of buffering delay (which decreases with fewer cells per packet) for bandwidth efficiency (which increases with more cells per packet, due to the per packet overhead). For dynamically allocated TDM links, whether the information rate varies due to activation of time slots or due to voice activity detection, TDMoIP employs ATM adaptation layer 2 (AAL2). This mechanism, defined in ITU-T standard I.363.2, was developed for carrying variable bit rate (VBR) services over ATM. AAL2 operates by buffering each TDM time slot into short minicells, inserting the time slot identifier and length indication, sequencing, and then sending this minicell only if it carries valid information. TDMoIP concatenates the minicells from all active time slots into a single packet. For time slots carrying high-level data link control (HDLC) data, such as data for common channel signaling (CCS), TDMoIP has a special adaptation that encapsulates stretches of non-idle data.|$|R

40|$|The {{demand of}} data traffic {{bandwidth}} is ever increasing. Optical networking technologies hold {{the promise of}} meeting this ever increasing demand. In the 1990 's, we saw tremendous progress in DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing) technologies through which more than 100 wavelength channels can be multiplexed onto one single strand of fiber to provide an aggregate data rate of hundreds of gigabits per second. Not stopping at point-to-point DWDM sytems, scientists have kept coming up with wavelength switching and control technologies for all-optical networks where bandwidth allocation can be done dynamically, flexibly, and delay-free. Note that on top of optical technologies, control technologies and intelligent routing are required to realize this dream. In a DWDM network, the data rate of an individual wavelength channel is typically in the gigabit-per-second range. In this thesis, we consider an optical network in which an optical channel can be subdivided in time into time slots. We call such a network a Photonic Circuit Switching (PCS) network. PCS is analogous to Optical TDM as has been suggested by others {{to be one of}} the feasible network proposal for the future. As opposed to optical burst switching, PCS does not require header processing of each "opitcal" packet. Rather, time slots are switched based on their positions within a Time Division Multiplexed (<b>TDM)</b> <b>frame</b> as in conventional TDM circuit switching in the electrical domain. However, there is one major problem for PCS - there is no RAM-like buffer available in the optical domain, and FDL (Fiber Delay Line) seems to be the only choice for dealing with buffering in the near future. FDL is expected to be far more expensive when compared to RAM, implying that it must be used highly efficiently. Therefore, in this thesis, we propose and analyze a number of buffer-efficient Routing and Time-slot assignments (RTA) algorithms for determining routes and assigning time-slots for photonic circuits. Our aim is to minimize the buffer usage in the whole network. In this thesis, two categories of RTA algorithms are investigated, namely, the coupled scheme and the decoupled scheme. The coupled scheme determines path and time-slots simulataneously, while the decoupled scheme chooses the path first, and then afterwards assigns the time-slot. Performances of different schemes are evaluated and compared. An efficient connection management scheme for setting up and tearing down connections is essential for the effective operation of a PCS network. In this thesis, we investigate how the GMPLS architecture with RSVP-TE as the connection management protocol can be adopted for connection management of the PCS network. In a dynamic network where the network status changes frequently, modifications to the RSVP-TE are needed. In addition, extensions and modifications required to improve the buffer efficiency will be proposed in this thesis...|$|E

The problem consists of data arrival based on external occurrences such as target tracking, and not due to sampling polls from internal sequencers.

This increases the required bandwidth to transfer collected data to ground sites proportional to the worst case arrival rate of asynchronous data and the maximum latency allowed for the application.
