5|$|A {{study with}} an intent-to-treat {{prospective}} design {{was published in}} 1998 by a team from the Johns Hopkins Hospital and followed-up by a report published in 2001. As with most studies of the ketogenic diet, there was no control group (patients who did not receive the treatment). The study enrolled 150 children. After three months, 83% of them were still on <b>the</b> <b>diet,</b> 26% had experienced a good reduction in seizures, 31% had had an excellent reduction and 3% were seizure-free. At twelve months, 55% were still on <b>the</b> <b>diet,</b> 23% had a good response, 20% had an excellent response and 7% were seizure-free. Those who had discontinued <b>the</b> <b>diet</b> by this stage did so because it was ineffective, too restrictive or due to illness, {{and most of those}} who remained were benefiting from it. The percentage of those still on <b>the</b> <b>diet</b> at two, three and four years was 39%, 20% and 12% respectively. During this period the most common reason for discontinuing <b>the</b> <b>diet</b> was because the children had become seizure-free or significantly better. At four years, 16% of the original 150 children had a good reduction in seizure frequency, 14% had an excellent reduction and 13% were seizure-free, though these figures include many who were no longer on <b>the</b> <b>diet.</b> Those remaining on <b>the</b> <b>diet</b> after this duration were typically not seizure-free but had had an excellent response.|$|E

One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained dietitians, who are needed to administer a ketogenic diet programme.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} the multiple dimensions {{and benefits of}} <b>the</b> Mediterranean <b>diet</b> as a sustainable diet, in order to revitalize this intangible food heritage at the country level; {{and to develop a}} multidimensional framework – <b>the</b> Med <b>Diet</b> 4. 0 – in which four sustainability benefits of <b>the</b> Mediterranean <b>diet</b> are presented in parallel: major health and nutrition benefits, low environmental impacts and richness in biodiversity, high sociocultural food values, and positive local economic returns. Design: A narrative review was applied at the country level to highlight the multiple sustainable benefits of <b>the</b> Mediterranean <b>diet</b> into a single multidimensional framework: <b>the</b> Med <b>Diet</b> 4. 0. Setting/subjects: We included studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals that contained data on the characterization of sustainable <b>diets</b> and of <b>the</b> Mediterranean <b>diet.</b> <b>The</b> methodological framework approach was finalized through a series of meetings, workshops and conferences where the framework was presented, discussed and ultimately refined. Results: <b>The</b> Med <b>Diet</b> 4. 0 provides a conceptual multidimensional framework to characterize <b>the</b> Mediterranean <b>diet</b> as a sustainable diet model, by applying principles of sustainability to <b>the</b> Mediterranean <b>diet.</b> Conclusions: By providing a broader understanding of the many sustainable benefits of <b>the</b> Mediterranean <b>diet,</b> <b>the</b> Med <b>Diet</b> 4. 0 can contribute to the revitalization of <b>the</b> Mediterranean <b>diet</b> by improving its current perception not only as a healthy diet but also a sustainable lifestyle model, with country-specific and culturally appropriate variations. It also takes into account the identity and diversity of food cultures and systems, expressed within the notion of <b>the</b> Mediterranean <b>diet,</b> across <b>the</b> Mediterranean region and {{in other parts of the}} world.

5|$|Impala browse {{as well as}} graze; either may predominate, {{depending}} upon the availability of resources. <b>The</b> <b>diet</b> comprises monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). Impala prefer places close to water sources, and resort to succulent vegetation if water is scarce. An analysis showed that <b>the</b> <b>diet</b> of impala is composed of 45% monocots, 45% dicots and 10% fruits; the proportion of grasses in <b>the</b> <b>diet</b> increases significantly (to as high as 90%) after the first rains, but declines in the dry season. Browsing predominates in the late wet and dry season, and diets are nutritionally poor in the mid-dry season, when impala feed mostly on woody dicots.

40|$|Two {{groups of}} male rats {{were placed on}} a feeding regimen in which a fat/protein diet and a carbohydrate/protein diet were {{available}} ad lib. Naltrexone was infused via osmotic minipumps either at <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>diets</b> were introduced or after one week of adaptation to <b>the</b> <b>diets.</b> In rats adapted to <b>the</b> <b>diets,</b> naltrexone caused {{a decrease in the}} intakes of fat/protein and carbohydrate/protein diets. Relative preferences for <b>the</b> two <b>diets</b> were generally unchanged. In contrast, when naltrexone was infused at the time of introduction of <b>the</b> <b>diets,</b> a polarization phenomenon was observed: rats tended to consume nearly all of their daily calories from either one <b>diet</b> or <b>the</b> other. Six rats (out of 10) showed a stronger preference for <b>the</b> carbohydrate/protein <b>diet</b> than did any of the saline-treated rats, while 3 showed a stronger preference for <b>the</b> fat/protein <b>diet</b> than did any of the saline-treated rats. Thus, the effect was not diet- or macronutrient-specific. These preferences became significantly less extreme after termination of naltrexone infusions. Conditioned aversions and naltrexone-induced reductions in exploratory behavior are discussed as potential explanations for this polarization effect. These results indicate that naltrexone has differential effects on the development versus <b>the</b> maintenance of <b>diet</b> preferences. Further, they emphasize the importance of examining individual differences as well as baseline preferences in studies on the control of intake and diet selection...|$|R

40|$|Background: Results {{of prior}} {{studies of the}} effect of {{viscosity}} reduction of high-energy-density, starch-containing diets on young children’s energy intakes are inconsistent, possibly because of dif-ferences in the characteristics of <b>the</b> unmodified <b>diets</b> with which <b>the</b> low-viscosity <b>diets</b> were compared. Objective: Our objective was {{to determine the effects of}} dietary viscosity and energy density on total daily energy consumption by young, non-breast-fed children. Design: We measured the amount of food consumed and the dura-tion of meals during 3 substudies, in each of which 3 study diets were offered for 4 consecutive days each in random sequence: high energy density, high viscosity (HD-HV); high energy density, low viscosity (HD-LV); and low energy density, low viscosity (LD-LV). The viscosity and energy density of the unmodified starch-containing HD-HV diet were varied across substudies to deter-mine whether the effect of amylase liquefaction was related to the initial characteristics of <b>the</b> HD-HV <b>diet.</b> <b>The</b> viscosity of <b>the</b> HV <b>diets</b> ranged from 79000 to 568000 mPa · s; energy density of <b>the</b> HD <b>diets</b> ranged from < 4. 18 to 4. 93 kJ (1. 00 – 1. 18 kcal) /g. Vis-cosity of <b>the</b> LV <b>diets</b> was < 3000 mPa · s and the energy density of <b>the</b> LD <b>diets</b> was < 2. 47 kJ (0. 6 kcal) /g. Results: In each substudy, children consumed more of <b>the</b> LD-LV <b>diet</b> (g · kg body wt 21 · d 21) than of <b>the</b> other <b>diets</b> and more of <b>the</b> HD-LV <b>diet</b> than of <b>the</b> HD-HV <b>diet</b> (P < 0. 001). Energy consumption from <b>the</b> HD-LV <b>diet</b> was greater than from <b>the</b> other <b>diets</b> (P < 0. 001), but the energy intakes from <b>the</b> latter <b>diets</b> were not significantly different.
