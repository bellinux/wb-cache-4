For instance, the Australian Aboriginal {{people continue to}} burn a sacred flame to honour his memory in Sydney's Victoria Park, while members of the Amerindian Hopi and Havasupai tribe revere his work. There are also many tributes <b>to</b> <b>Bob</b> Marley throughout India, including restaurants, hotels, and cultural festivals.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Gerald Ford {{moves into}} the house across the street after Bush leaves. When {{originally}} conceived, Richard Nixon was going to move in instead, though this was changed <b>to</b> <b>Bob</b> Dole following Nixon's death. The writers then decided it would be funnier if it were Ford since they believed he was the politician who best represented Homer. Keeler's first draft also included a musical number in the style of Tom Lehrer's satirical recordings, although this ended up being cut.|$|E

His attempts to track her lead <b>to</b> <b>Bob</b> Bletcher's death and Butler's escape. Butler is revealed as a demon, capable of changing form on a whim. She later reappears as a succubus, sexually assaulting Black in his sleep to frame him for rape and (as a large snake) trying to kill Emma Hollis. Although both ploys are foiled, Butler escapes.|$|E
5|$|By {{this point}} in the year, the British Invasion—started by the Beatles' {{previous}} U.S. visit—was gathering momentum, and several more UK acts had come to the United States, including The Dave Clark Five, Billy J. Kramer, and Gerry & the Pacemakers. One third of all U.S. top ten hits in 1964 were by British acts.

5|$|Cecil {{was drawn}} to {{resemble}} David Hyde Pierce, but still look similar <b>to</b> <b>Bob.</b> According to director Pete Michels, {{it was difficult to}} draw Bob and Cecil standing together because their feet are both so big. There was a scene featuring Hans Moleman and his house, which was cut, but his house can still briefly be seen in the scene where Cecil throws Bart off a cliff. The sequence was cut in order {{to make room for the}} explanation of why Bob was sent back to prison. Ken Keeler has said that it is his favorite deleted scene.|$|E

Alice cannot know which cards Bob has because {{she does not have}} access <b>to</b> <b>Bob's</b> keys B6 <b>to</b> B10 which are required to decrypt the cards.|$|R

Their eye shine creates a unique pattern among lemurs because they tend <b>to</b> <b>bob</b> their heads up and down and from side to side.|$|E

5|$|There {{was also}} an {{ownership}} change in what {{had been one of}} the most stable front offices in professional sports. In February 1991, after being diagnosed with cancer, Tim Mara sold his 50% interest in the team <b>to</b> <b>Bob</b> Tisch for a reported $80 million. The sale was worked out before the Super Bowl but not announced until afterwords, to avoid distracting the team. It marked the first time since their inception in 1925 that the Giants had not been wholly owned and controlled by the Mara family.|$|E
5|$|After {{struggling}} {{in the latter}} half of the 1960s and the entire 1970s, the Giants hired an outsider, George Young, to run football operations for the first time in several decades. The Giants on-field product and business aspects improved rapidly following the hiring. In 1990, Jack Mara's son, Tim, who was struggling with cancer at the time, sold his half of the team <b>to</b> <b>Bob</b> Tisch. This marked the first time in franchise history the team had not been solely owned by the Mara family. In 2005, Wellington Mara, who had been with the team since its inception in 1925 when he worked as a ball boy, died. His death was followed two weeks later by the death of Tisch.|$|E

5|$|After {{upsetting}} second-ranked Michigan State, 34–7, Maryland {{climbed to}} an AP Poll ranking of {{eighth in the}} nation and then defeated Georgetown. The following game they met N.C. State at Byrd Stadium for Homecoming weekend. In the first quarter, a Maryland fumble rolled out of the end zone for a safety, and soon after, another fumble set up a touchdown rush by NC State. Maryland advanced inside the N.C. State five-yard line three times but was unable to score. In the third quarter, NC State scored again to expand their lead, 0–16. Maryland scored on a 21-yard pass from Jack Scarbath <b>to</b> <b>Bob</b> Shemonski. With three minutes remaining, Shemonski connected with a pass to Pete Augsburger for another touchdown. A 47-yard drive into Wolfpack territory ended with an interception in the end zone with seconds remaining. The loss effectively ended the Terrapins' hopes for a bowl game bid. The second loss dropped them out of the AP Poll {{for the remainder of the}} year.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920 season, the spitball was banned by Major League Baseball. As a current spitball pitcher, Coveleski was grandfathered in, and was allowed to continue using the pitch until his retirement. He won his first seven starting appearances of the season, but on May 28, his wife died suddenly, and he was given some time off to mourn, returning to pitching two weeks later. Nearly three months later, he was the starting pitcher against the New York Yankees on August 16. In the game, Coveleski hit a sacrifice fly to help the Indians win, 4–3, but it was best remembered as the game where Yankees pitcher Carl Mays hit Ray Chapman, leading to the only death in MLB history from a pitch. He finished the 1920 regular season with 24 wins, 14 losses, a 2.49 ERA, and 133 strikeouts; he led the AL in strikeouts and finished second in ERA <b>to</b> <b>Bob</b> Shawkey.|$|E
