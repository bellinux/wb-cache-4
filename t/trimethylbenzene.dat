5000|$|Transalkylation {{reactions}} are often performed using zeolite catalysts. Zeolites are crystalline solids composed of [...] and [...] These crystals are porous in nature with varying pore size.

50|$|This type of {{reaction}} {{can also be}} performed with toluene and <b>trimethylbenzene</b> to produce xylene. The reaction occurs via equilibrium, so the product is not pure xylene. Many products are produced with varying numbers of methyl groups. The quantities in which each product is produced depends on the M/R ratio. This is {{the ratio of the}} number of methyl groups to the number of benzene rings in all of the substrates. For example, in the disproportionation of toluene, the M/R ratio is 1. Side reactions in which alkanes are produced reduce the number of methyl groups available which decreases the M/R ratio. This can be mitigated by adding compounds with higher numbers of methyl groups, such as <b>trimethylbenzene.</b> The ratio of products produced depends only on the M/R ratio so different starting materials can produce the same compounds via transalkylation.|$|E

The formation of the tetrahyrdo derivative can be suppressed through the selection of catalysts, solvents, and reaction conditions. Some suggested solvent mixtures are polyalkylated benzenes and alkyl phosphates or tetraalkyl ureas, <b>trimethylbenzenes</b> and alkylcyclohexanol esters, and methylnaphthalene and nonyl alcohols.|$|R

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it could be}} seen that the primary single {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons formed were C 8 (ethylbenzene and xylenes) aromatic hydrocarbons followed by C 7 (toluene) and C 9 (<b>trimethylbenzenes)</b> aromatic hydrocarbons. Considering the limited pore size of HZSM- 5 -based catalyst, larger aromatic hydrocarbons such as C 9 + aromatic hydrocarbons (mainly including C 10 and C 11 aromatic hydrocarbons) were difficult to generate. Even if C 9 + aromatic hydrocarbons could form in the pore volume, considering the diffusion limitations caused by the confined pore diameter, they could not pass through the channel readily and then {{came out of the}} catalyst. The above-mentioned restriction effect could be reflected by the variation trends of C 9 + aromatic hydrocarbons with the increasing loading amount of the Catalyst II. The more loading amount of the Catalyst II indicated more mesoporous existence, the more C 9 + aromatic hydrocarbons formed. With regard to the rather low selectivity towards C 6 aromatic hydrocarbon, Tian et al. [9] have proposed that methanol had a high capability of alkylation. Thus, the alkyls formed during the reaction could easily add to benzene rings through electrophilic attack, and as a result, xylenes and <b>trimethylbenzenes</b> were formed.|$|R

The inclusion selectivity for isomeric mixtures of <b>trimethylbenzenes</b> and tetramethylbenzene guests by these host frameworks has been examined. The organic residues of the MDS and TMBDS pillars mimic the isomeric <b>trimethylbenzenes</b> and tetramethylbenzenes, respectively, suggesting an avenue to a separations protocol based on molecular recognition during inclusion and subsequent crystallization. Pairwise competition experiments, in which inclusion compounds are crystallized from solutions containing {{a mixture of}} two molecular isomers, map the inclusion selectivity of a particular host {{as a function of}} guest content in solution. The single crystal structures suggest that guest inclusion selectivity is governed by the ability of a host to achieve efficient packing with the guest molecules and its ability to allow efficient guest-guest packing in the one-dimensional channels. Consequently, the more compliant G 2 MDS host exhibits higher selectivities for guest inclusion. Overall, the selectivity patterns appear to reflect size and shape compatibility between the host and guest, suggesting opportunities for separations of isomers based on straightforward crystallization processes...|$|R

The activity of MeAPO- 5 catalysts follows the order of SiAPO > MgAPO > MnAPO > ZnAPO > CoAPO which can be correlated with the acid properties of catalysts. The same correlation was found for MeAPSO- 5 catalysts. The strength of acid sites of the catalyst influences the competition among various reactions that occur during the transalkylation process.

Here, these surrogates and a jet fuel are tested in premixed, nonuniform flows. The counterflow configuration is employed, and critical conditions of extinction are measured. In addition, the reference components tested are n-heptane, n-decane, n-dodecane, methylcyclohexane, <b>trimethylbenzene,</b> and o-xylene. Measured critical conditions of extinction of the Aachen surrogate and surrogate C are compared with those for the jet fuel. In general the alkanes n-heptane, n-decane, and n-dodecane, and methylcyclohexane {{are found to be}} more reactive than the aromatics o-xylene and <b>trimethylbenzene.</b> Flame structure and critical conditions of extinction are predicted for the reference components and the surrogates using a semi-detailed kinetic model. The predicted values are compared with experimental data. Sensitivity analysis shows that the lower reactivity of the aromatic species arises from the formation of resonantly stabilized radicals. These radicals are found to have a scavenging effect. The present study on premixed flows together with previous studies on nonpremixed flows show that the Aachen surrogate and surrogate C reproduce many aspects of premixed and nonpremixed combustion of jet fuels...|$|E

Triexponential OH decays were observed {{in the presence of}} the <b>trimethylbenzenes,</b> indicating the participation of more than one adduct species. Analytical solutions for the system of differential equations with two adduct isomers were derived, and the OH decay curves were evaluated based on this reaction model. This led to significant improvements of fit qualities and notable changes in OH rate constants compared to a previous model with a single adduct species. The detailed analysis was confined to 1, 3, 5 -trimethylbenzene where reversible formation of two OH-aromatic ortho-and ipso-adduct isomers is feasible in accordance with the extended reaction model. Only after inclusion of additional isomerization reactions, consistent thermochemical data were obtained from the fitted rate constants. Reaction enthalpies of - 83 +/- 7 kJ mol(- 1) and - 35 +/- 22 kJ mol(- 1) were derived for the formation of one adduct isomer and the isomerization into the other, respectively. Based on literature data, the more and less stable adducts were assigned to ipso- and ortho-adduct isomers, respectively. The potential isomerization precluded the determination of primary yields of adduct isomers but formation of the ipso-adduct in any case is a minor process. For the rate constants of the OH + 1, 3, 5 -trimethylbenzene reaction an Arrhenius expression k(OH) = 1. 32 x 10 (- 11) cm(3) s(- 1) exp(450 +/- 50 K/T) was obtained.

Aromatic hydrocarbons, categorized into five groups, show a yield order of ortho (o -xylene and o -ethyltoluene) > one substitute (ethylbenzene, propylbenzene and isopropylbenzene) > meta (m -xylene and m -ethyltoluene) > three substitute (<b>trimethylbenzenes)</b> > para (p -xylene and p -ethyltoluene). SOA yields of aromatic hydrocarbon photooxidation do not monotonically decrease when increasing alkyl substitute number. The ortho position promotes SOA formation while the para position suppresses aromatic oxidation and SOA formation. Observed SOA chemical composition and volatility confirm that higher yield is associated with further oxidation. SOA chemical composition also suggests that aromatic oxidation increases with increasing alkyl substitute chain length and branching structure. Further, carbon dilution conjecture developed by Li et al.  (2016) is extended in this study {{to serve as a}} standard method {{to determine the extent of}} oxidation of an alkyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon...|$|R
