Bhardwaj was afraid of dancing, suspecting a possible sprain, and found the costumes uneasy, but had to continue upon the choreographer's insistence. Canadian-born Indian actress Ayesha Shiva was signed to play Kajal's friend in the film.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's {{approach}} to science was observational: he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> a phenomenon by describing and depicting it in utmost detail {{and did not}} emphasise experiments or theoretical explanation. Since he lacked formal education in Latin and mathematics, contemporary scholars mostly ignored Leonardo the scientist, although he did teach himself Latin. In the 1490s he studied mathematics under Luca Pacioli and prepared a series of drawings of regular solids in a skeletal form to be engraved as plates for Pacioli's book De divina proportione, published in 1509.|$|E

25|$|Heart Mountain is an 8,123-foot (2,476 m) klippe {{just north}} of Cody in the U.S. state of Wyoming, rising {{from the floor of}} the Bighorn Basin. The {{mountain}} is composed of limestone and dolomite of Ordovician through Mississippian age (about 500 to 350 million years old), but it rests on the Willwood Formation, rocks that are about 55 million years old—rock on the summit of Heart Mountain is thus almost 300 million years older than the rocks at the base. For over one hundred years, geologists have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how these older rocks came to rest on much younger strata.|$|E
25|$|Tocqueville's {{penetrating}} analysis {{sought to}} understand the peculiar nature of US political life. In describing the US, he agreed with thinkers such as Aristotle and Montesquieu that the balance of property determined the balance of political power, but his conclusions after that differed radically from those of his predecessors. Tocqueville <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> why the US was so different from Europe in the last throes of aristocracy. The US, {{in contrast to the}} aristocratic ethic, was a society where hard work and money-making was the dominant ethic, where the common man enjoyed a level of dignity which was unprecedented, where commoners never deferred to elites, and where what he described as crass individualism and market capitalism had taken root to an extraordinary degree.|$|E

25|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to Parnell, Redmond lacked charisma. He worked well in small committees, but had little success in arousing large audiences. Parnell always chose the nominees to Parliament. Now they were selected by the local party organisations, giving Redmond numerous weak MPs over whom he had little control. Redmond was an excellent representative of the old Ireland, but grew increasingly old-fashioned because he {{paid little attention to}} the new forces attracting younger Irishmen, such as Sinn Féin in politics, the Gaelic Athletic Association in sports, and the Gaelic League in cultural affairs. He never <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the unionist forces emerging in Ulster. Redmond was further weakened in 1914 by the formation by Sinn Féin members of the Irish Volunteers. His enthusiastic support for the British war effort alienated many Irish nationalists. His party had been increasingly hollowed out, and a major crisis—notably the Easter Rising—was enough to destroy it.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{previous}} liberal conceptions viewing society as populated by selfish individuals, Green viewed society as an organic whole {{in which all}} individuals {{have a duty to}} promote the common good. His ideas spread rapidly and were developed by other thinkers such as Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse and John A. Hobson. In a few years, this New Liberalism had become the essential social and political programme of the Liberal Party in Britain, and it would encircle much of the world in the 20th century. In addition to examining negative and positive liberty, liberals have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the proper relationship between liberty and democracy. As they struggled to expand suffrage rights, liberals increasingly understood that people left out of the democratic decision-making process were liable to the tyranny of the majority, a concept explained in Mill's On Liberty and in Democracy in America (1835) by Alexis de Tocqueville. As a response, liberals began demanding proper safeguards to thwart majorities in their attempts at suppressing the rights of minorities.|$|E
25|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of this myopathy is very varied. Many mutations {{occur in}} the region of actin’s indentation near to its nucleotide binding sites, while others occur in Domain 2, or in the areas where interaction occurs with associated proteins. This goes some way to explain the great variety of clumps that form in these cases, such as Nemaline or Intranuclear Bodies or Zebra Bodies. Changes in actin’s folding occur in nemaline myopathy as well as changes in its aggregation and there are also changes in the expression of other associated proteins. In some variants where intranuclear bodies are found the changes in the folding masks the nucleus’s protein exportation signal so that the accumulation of actin's mutated form occurs in the cell nucleus. On the other hand, it appears that mutations to ACTA1 that give rise to a CFTDM have a greater effect on sarcomeric function than on its structure. Recent investigations have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> this apparent paradox, which suggests there is no clear correlation between the number of rods and muscular weakness. It appears that some mutations are able to induce a greater apoptosis rate in type II muscular fibres.|$|E

Another attempt using vertically oriented antennas [...] "completely cured the problem", and allowed the antennas to be positioned anywhere along the wing. When he later <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> why the antennas had always been horizontal, he found this had come from the ASV trials where it was found this reduced reflections from the waves. Given the parallel development of the ASV and AI systems, this arrangement had been copied to the AI side without anyone considering other solutions.|$|E

Believing that the modern western worldview failed to understand this process, Duerr criticizes the work of those anthropologists and scientists who had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> [...] "archaic" [...] society through a western rationalist framework, instead advocating a return to [...] "archaic" [...] modes of thought.|$|E

[...] Rolling Stones Daniel Kreps gave a mixed review of the video, calling the song [...] "over-the-top" [...] with a [...] "lackluster" [...] and [...] "understated" [...] video. Doses Leah Collins was more neutral in her review, questioning if Gaga was simply [...] "swooning with nostalgia for other pop culture nuggets that have featured the same NYC backdrop of fire escapes and brown-stone steps" [...] or just attempting to [...] "be saving a metric buttload on the budget".

500|$|The {{scenario}} {{was written}} by freelance writer Kenji Terada, based on a story by Sakaguchi. Ishii heavily influenced the game's setting with his idea of the crystals. He also suggested illustrator Yoshitaka Amano as character designer, but Sakaguchi declined at first as {{he had never heard}} the artist's name before. When Sakaguchi showed Ishii some drawings on magazine clippings and told him that this was the art style he was looking for, Ishii revealed to him that these were actually created by Amano, hence leading to his involvement in the game. The music for Final Fantasy was composed by Nobuo Uematsu and marked his 16th video game music composition. Iranian-American programmer Nasir Gebelli was hired to code the game. He initially <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> all aspects of the gameplay but was soon advised by Sakaguchi to just program the design concepts so {{he did not have to}} explain everything to Gebelli in detail. Among the other developers were graphic designer Kazuko Shibuya, programmers Kiyoshi Yoshii and Ken Narita, as well as debugger Hiroyuki Ito. When the project started to show promise, designer Hiromichi Tanaka and his [...] "B-Team" [...] joined to aid development. The lack of faith in Sakaguchi's team, as well as its unpopularity within the company, motivated the staff members to give their best.|$|E
500|$|The Workmans {{struggled}} with labor problems continually, needing local porters to carry gear {{for them because}} they could not carry a sufficient amount for themselves for a multi-month expedition. [...] They had to transport Mummery tents, eider sleeping bags, camera equipment, scientific instruments, and a large supply of food. The porters were skeptical of the entire venture. The locals rarely climbed mountains and were not used to taking orders from a woman, which made Fanny's position difficult. The Workmans tried to solve these problems with condescension and high-handedness. Kenneth Mason maintains in his history of Himalayan mountaineering, written in 1955, that [...] "The Workmans were, on their journeys, the victims of their own faults. They were too impatient and rarely <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the mentality of the porters and so did not get the best out of them." [...] Labor problems beset all of their expeditions because, as Miller puts it, [...] "Almost alone of Victorian travellers, the Workmans had absolutely no sympathy or even common-sense understanding of the local people, into whose poor and remote villages they burst with trains of followers demanding service and supplies." [...] In her chapter on Workman, Miller argues that the couple, being American, did not have the same sense of caste or class that British explorers had: [...] "the Workmans, like most of their countrymen, plunged in their enterprises headlong, expecting their enormous energy to overcome all obstacles. They were justifiably criticized by the British for their callous, incompetent behavior toward the Indians." ...|$|E
