25|$|Russell and Moore {{were devoted}} to clarity in {{arguments}} by breaking down philosophical position into their simplest components. Russell, in particular, saw formal logic and science as the principal tools of the philosopher. Russell did not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> separate methods for philosophy. Russell thought philosophers should strive to answer the most general of propositions about the world and this would help eliminate confusions. In particular, he wanted to end {{what he saw as}} the excesses of metaphysics. Russell adopted William of Ockham's principle against multiplying unnecessary entities, Occam's Razor, as a central part of the method of analysis.|$|E
500|$|Though DeLonge {{hoped to}} retain the angst present in the band's past work, he wanted to [...] "deliver it in a package that's very modern, using {{instrumentations}} and formulas to launch you into different places with music that is not just three-chord pop-punk with riffs." [...] He later felt the album was not progressive as he had wished: [...] "I'm thinking, 'Why don't we do this? Why don't we create these landscapes?' I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been pushing ourselves, and trying to push the genre forward." [...] Likewise, Barker felt DeLonge wanted their music to be derivative of groups such as U2 or Coldplay, commenting, [...] "For us, we were always like 'Blink is Blink, man. We want to sound like fucking Blink-182.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{urgency of}} {{negotiating}} a concession {{was made clear}} to Rhodes {{during a visit to}} London in June 1888, when he learned of the London syndicate's letter to Knutsford, and of their appointment of Maund. Rhodes now understood that the Matabeleland concession could still go elsewhere if he did not secure the document quickly. [...] "Someone has to get the country, and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> the best chance," [...] Rhodes told Rothschild; [...] "I have always been afraid of the difficulty of dealing with the Matabele king. He is the only block to central Africa, as, once we have his territory, the rest is easy... the rest is simply a village system with separate headmen... I have faith in the country, and Africa is on the move. I think it is a second Cinderella." ...|$|E
3000|$|... “My {{sister is}} {{angry with me}} for {{continuing}} contact with mum. She <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{nothing to do with}} her. She does not understand it is compulsive behaviour. She feels rejected by mum.” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Grace," [...] said I, at length--"I am not {{envious of}} this {{probable}} accession of fortune to the Hardinges, but I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> all <b>have</b> {{been much more}} united--much happier--without it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose you're one of {{the people}} who <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> all <b>have</b> professions," [...] she said, rather distantly, as if feeling her way among the phantoms of an unknown world.|$|R
500|$|November's {{first game}} {{was at the}} Mata Real against Paços de Ferreira. Benfica scored first with a header by Cristian Rodríguez, but Tiago Valente tied the game {{a few minutes later}} for Paços. In the 85th minute, Kostas Katsouranis scored Benefica's winning goal with an assist by Rodríguez. To Camacho, the win was [...] "difficult but very important". On 6 November, Benfica played Celtic on the road. In their second game against the team, Benfica lost 1–0 on a goal by Aiden McGeady. With the loss, Benfica was in last place and needed to defeat Milan to remain in the Champions League. Although Camacho was optimistic, he was aware of the high stakes. On 11 November, Benfica hosted Boavista in search of their fourth {{consecutive}} win in the Primeira Liga. Cardozo scored in the first half, with Boavista tying the score in the 58th minute. Benfica then scored five goals in the final 40 minutes for a 6–1 win. After the match, Rui Costa said, [...] "We had our fourth consecutive win in the Primeira Liga, and I think we are on the right track." [...] After a third international break, Benfica resumed on the 24th with an away game against Académica. Lito scored first for Académica, but a free kick by Rui Costa tied the game. Académica goalkeeper Ricardo made two errors, allowing Luisão and Adu to score Benfica's second and third goals, and Camacho credited the late win to his players' perseverance and commitment. November ended with a decisive match against Milan. Andrea Pirlo scored for Benfica, but Maxi Pereira's 23th-minute shot tied the game. Benfica's fate was determined by events in Glasgow, as Celtic defeated Shakhtar Donetsk with an added-time goal. Camacho bemoaned his team's luck: [...] "We're a bit unhappy. For what we did in this competition I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> had more of a chance to go through, so for me football has not been fair to Benfica." ...|$|E
2500|$|But after {{enrolling in}} public school and moving to Montana — a {{predominantly}} white state, albeit one with a decidedly hippie-ish vibe — Lamb and Lynx decided they simply no longer believed what they’d been taught. ..."I’m glad {{we were in the}} band," [...] Lynx said, [...] "but I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been pushed toward something a little more mainstream and easier for us to handle than being front-men for a belief system that we didn’t even completely understand at that time. We were little kids." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hitchens has listed actions {{done by the}} Conservative Party that {{he deems}} as [...] "anti-British", such as the {{bringing}} the United Kingdom into the European Economic Community (later European Union). Despite this, {{he does not believe}} that Conservative Brexiteers such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson are truly opposed to membership of the European Union, and did not vote to leave in the Brexit referendum {{as a result of this}} disillusionment. He has also claimed that [...] "I think referenda are fundamentally unconstitutional, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> them" [...] and was not [...] "particularly pleased" [...] with the outcome of the EU referendum. He has also described Brexit as a [...] "constitutional crisis" [...] due to the pro-EU makeup of Parliament, and has stated that he believes it would take 10 years for Britain to fully leave the European Union.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was indeed, sir. At {{one time}} they fairly drove us back, but I <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> beaten them {{even if you}} had not brought help to us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The De la Noues always die {{upon the}} field of honour," [...] he remarked. [...] "I <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> some more men in the angle by the gun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not know, Dogeetah, but I think not. If {{she were}} dead I <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> heard some rumour of the Feast of the eating {{of the dead}} Mother." ...|$|R
2500|$|In August 2015, Eno {{endorsed}} Jeremy Corbyn's {{campaign in}} the Labour Party leadership election. He said: [...] "I don't think electability really {{is the most important}} thing. What's important is that someone changes the conversation and moves us off this small-minded agenda." [...] He wrote in The Guardian: [...] "By gathering this level of support Jeremy Corbyn has already shown that there is a strong nascent progressive movement in this country. He's shown the others in his party that there's a well of commitment for them to tap, if they have the will and the courage to do it. If nothing further happens with his campaign, that would be an undeniable and valuable contribution. I admit it: PM Corbyn is a long shot right now – but only four weeks ago bookies were giving 100-1 against him even becoming the candidate. Now it's 7-4 on. Things can change, and quickly. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> some faith and give it a try." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It was {{a rotten}} thing for Werner to do!" [...] {{declared}} Randy, his eyes flashing. [...] "Really, do you know, Jack, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> had him arrested for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I don't <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> much {{difficulty}} in determining that,' said I; 'with your permission {{we will take}} the first train down to Sussex, and go a little more deeply into the matter upon the spot.' ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> succeeded, {{even though}} the ship was wracked from stem to stern by the terrific buffetings she received, and though she were half {{submerged}} {{the greater part of}} the time, had no further accident befallen us.|$|R
6000|$|There was a supper-tray {{after we}} got home at night, and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> all <b>have</b> enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable {{domestic}} occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid came in, and said, [...] "If you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{introduced}} {{such a young}} serpent {{into the}} bosom of our family! and have left him {{in the company of}} that guileless darling!" [...] and she points to Master Miles.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> a talk," [...] the wub said. [...] "I'd like {{to discuss}} this with you, Captain, if I might. I can see that you and I do not agree on some basic issues." ...|$|E
6000|$|SIR PEARCE. Strictly between ourselves, O'Flaherty, and as {{one soldier}} to another [O'Flaherty salutes, but without stiffening], do you <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> got an army without {{conscription}} if domestic life had been as happy as people say it is? ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Angela and I {{exchanged}} glances. I <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> both <b>have</b> laughed but for {{the tears}} which we had seen in his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; no. I {{wish the}} title could have passed over my head, Silverbridge, {{and gone to}} you at once. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> both <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been suited better. But there are things which one should not consider. Even in this place I may perhaps do something. Shall you attack us very bitterly?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It answers Hartley's description," [...] he said. [...] "After all, I don't <b>think</b> it's {{extraordinary}} <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{taken so}} much trouble to push on past the right place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have had}} a pretty good fright ourselves," [...] Dick replied. [...] "If it had not been for Blacking pluckily getting through them to take you the news, I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> seen daylight. Is he much hurt, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{other man}} nodded. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'm sorry, because after {{what you have}} told me I almost <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> hit it tolerably well together. At any time you think I could be of service, {{you can write to}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Fire, as she passed, {{was saying}} to Water, [...] "We are getting tired in Boupari of Lavita, the son of Sami. If {{the luck of the}} island is not to change, it is high time, I <b>think,</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> a new Tu-Kila-Kila." ...|$|E
30|$|Students’ digital stories {{point to}} the changes {{that they would like}} to see in schools, and there are some {{recurrent}} themes including curricular “usefulness” (e.g. “I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> only <b>have</b> classes that are helpful to the careers we want”), teacher relationships (e.g. “teachers need to have a positive attitude towards teaching the students”) and participation (e.g. “let the students be more active”).|$|R
6000|$|... "Good heavens!" [...] Skinner broke in; [...] "to <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> three <b>should</b> <b>have</b> passed {{close to}} your brother and {{that none of us}} <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{recognized}} him! How awfully unfortunate!" ...|$|R
60|$|ENVY is an uneasiness of the mind, {{caused by}} the {{consideration}} of a good we desire obtained by one <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> had it before us.|$|R
6000|$|... "I should <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{to go up}} as much as down," [...] said Mr. Holiday; [...] "for it is {{necessary}} to ascend as much {{to get to the top}} of any hill from the bottom as you descend in going down to the bottom from the top." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At laste Irish, my boy," [...] {{the doctor}} said, as {{surprised}} as Charlie had been. [...] "To <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been talking Swedish to each other, instead of our native tongue. And what is your name? And {{what is it you}} are doing here, as a Swede, at all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sister, I don't agree there. Mr. Thomas had {{a perfect}} RIGHT to do as he liked with his own land; but I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> had no trouble {{if you had been}} willing to sell him the corner of our garden where the old summer-house is, for his hens," [...] began Miss Penny in a mild tone.|$|E
60|$|This, I <b>think,</b> is what <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{been told}} if the Pentateuch {{had been the}} {{invention}} of man. This {{is exactly what we}} are NOT told; but, on the contrary, the very opposite.|$|R
6000|$|... "For our sakes, yes; {{for your}} own I am not so sure. To tell you the truth, I <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done better never to have started on this mad expedition. However, things look a little more {{promising}} now, though Nam and his company have still to be reckoned with, and we don't seem much nearer the rubies, which are our main object." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{that is the}} difficulty. We {{could not}} employ axes to cut down the trees, and to saw them down would be an interminable work. I <b>think,</b> Mr. Ferguson, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> to carry them." ...|$|R
