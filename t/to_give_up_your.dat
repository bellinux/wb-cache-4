25|$|It dispelled so many {{myths about}} the {{coaching}} business -- {{that you had}} to be a yeller and a screamer to win. You can be your own person, treat people with respect, be very demanding but demanding in a way that doesn't trample on people. And you don't have <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> faith to win in the NFL. It confirmed and re-affirmed an awful lot of the beliefs I held about coaching....|$|E
2500|$|... "Smart was good, {{but having}} {{the ability to}} beat someone senseless! Now that was real power. Education was often {{talked about in the}} apartment, but always with the implied threat that if your marks weren't acceptable, be ready <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> soul to God because your ass belonged to our father ... nd As weren't acceptable." ...|$|E
2500|$|You, Emperor, {{should not}} ask {{something}} like this, and Chu Liang's response was absurd and rebellious. [...] Gaozu of Han was often defeated, {{and the first}} emperor of Shu could not even protect his wife and children. [...] Winning and losing battles happened throughout history. [...] How can you be ready <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> state just based on one defeat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The loss {{will fall}} on you, no doubt, because the Eustace people {{will make you}} pay for them. You'll have <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> half <b>your</b> {{jointure}} for your life. That's what it will come to. To think of your travelling about with those things in a box!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's my duty <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> honor; but I ask {{permission}} {{to think a}} third chase should always be the last one. That's a melancholy sight to a man of feelin', Captain Cuffe, the object between the two midship-guns, on the starboard side of the main-deck, sir?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But--you won't be offended, but I want to understand. The thing seems such a muddle <b>to</b> me. You've <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> practice--how do {{you mean}} to live?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Niven had {{particular}} scorn {{for those}} newspaper columnists covering the war who typed out self-glorifying and excessively florid prose about their meagre wartime experiences. Niven stated, [...] "Anyone who says a bullet sings past, hums past, flies, pings, or whines past, has never heard one—they go crack!" [...] He gave a few {{details of his}} war experience in his autobiography, The Moon's a Balloon: his private conversations with Winston Churchill, the bombing of London, {{and what it was}} like entering Germany with the occupation forces. Niven first met Churchill at a dinner party in February 1940. Churchill singled him out from the crowd and stated, [...] "Young man, you did a fine thing <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> film career to fight for your country. Mark you, had you not done so − it would have been despicable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are willing}} <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> position, your {{beautiful}} houses, your carriages and milliner's accounts {{to come back}} to Bohemianism?" ...|$|E
60|$|But I saw in {{the papers}} {{that you were going}} <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> seat in the House owing to ill-health.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see that}} John and Judy seem {{to respond to}} your care; but is it right <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> all <b>your</b> comfort and peace, and even your health, for so little as you are enabled to do for them? It {{would be better if}} there were some {{appreciation}} of your care, or some attention paid--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I had {{any notion}} of {{accepting}} you," [...] said Ida reflectively, [...] "I should at least have the consolation of knowing that you didn't make anything by your bargain; for my fifteen hundred dollars would just amount to the three hundred a year which you would have <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> with <b>your</b> fellowship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Nina! But {{when your}} aunt shall once know your secret, she {{will give you}} no peace till you are out of her power. She will leave no stone unturned <b>to</b> make you <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> Jew lover." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'J. C. P. [...] "Capital, George, {{but are you}} all willing <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> {{living in}} villages among your own {{particular}} relations? [...] " ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I know well, {{that our}} joint income should be ample {{for the next}} four or five years. You will have <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> horse--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is, {{provided}} {{you want to}} come in, Sam. Dad doesn't want you <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> idea of becoming a lawyer unless you want to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want," [...] I {{went on as}} I slipped new {{cartridges}} {{into the}} rifle, [...] "I want you <b>to</b> promise <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> drink for <b>your</b> daughter's sake. That's what nearly did for you just now, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That doesn't {{matter a}} bit. If you have more, why, {{the more the}} merrier. If you have less, {{or if you have}} <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> all <b>your</b> {{property}} when you're married, I will soon make another ten thousand to supply the loss. Only give me one good word, and, by George, I'll fight the seven champions of Christendom, one down and t'other come on, for five thousand a side each. Hang the money!" ...|$|R
50|$|The movie {{starts out}} with a village leader coming into {{the house of a}} crying mother. He says <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> hope that <b>your</b> husband is still alive. Resisting from the comments, the mother decides to run away with her child.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will not}} be more fit for matrimony because you are going <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> profession. Now, Lord Ongar has--heaven knows what--perhaps sixty {{thousand}} a year." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} a hard bargain," [...] she said, doubtfully; [...] "for you would have <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> occupation; and I should give up nothing but my unfruitful liberty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On this principle, mademoiselle, you are, then, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> own {{judgment}} about France, {{on all those}} points in which I have the misfortune to differ from you," [...] said Eve, laughing.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} a little thing, of course, that," [...] she answered. [...] "But I've been {{thinking}} it must be that that's {{at the bottom of}} it all; and that is why God lets there be weak things--children and little animals and men and women in pain, that we feel sorry for, so that people like you and Robert and so many others are willing <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> all <b>your</b> lives <b>to</b> helping them. And that is what He wants." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} thinking," [...] said the Absolute Fool, [...] "that it is {{perfectly}} ridiculous, and very uncomfortable, to continue this search any longer. I would go back, but my master would not suffer me to return without knowing where you are going. I have, therefore, a plan <b>to</b> propose. <b>Give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> useless search for this Prince, who is probably not nearly so handsome and intellectual as I am, and marry me. We will then return, and I will assume the reins of government in your domain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't quite know, but I am very ambitious. I {{want to be}} famous, to do {{something}} for you all, to make some sacrifice for Rose, and, if I can, to have something <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> for <b>your</b> sake. Let me wait and work longer I know I haven't earned my welcome yet," [...] pleaded Phebe so earnestly that her lover knew it would be in vain to try and turn her, so wisely contented himself with half, since he could not have the whole.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Cool!' cried James, {{as soon as}} he was gone. 'To {{expect you}} <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> school at his beck, to come and keep house for him as long as it may suit him!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Ducaine," [...] he said, [...] "we have {{discussed}} this matter thoroughly, {{and we are}} all practically agreed that {{there is no reason why}} we should ask you <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> position." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay, I did {{not mean}} to press you,' said Lord Ormersfield, gently; 'but I thought, since James has had the {{fellowship}} and Clara has been at school, that you wished <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> pupils.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall not}} be asked <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> any of <b>your</b> independence," [...] said Julia, with a smile--a melancholy smile, that gave but little sign of pleasantness within. Then, on a sudden, her face became stern and hard. [...] "The fact is," [...] she said, [...] "I {{do not intend to}} keep Lord Ongar's money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ruth told me. She said {{both her}} father and her mother are very much upset over {{the way you have}} treated them. They want to be friends with you, and her father is willing to do {{whatever}} is right regarding what took place years ago. She said her folks would like nothing better than <b>to</b> have you <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> lonely life on this island and come down and make your home with them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{might do}} so, of course, Vincent, if you liked; {{but unless you}} change a good deal, I don't think your {{supervision}} would amount to very much. When you are not at school you are always on horseback and away, and we see little enough of you, and I do not think you are likely {{for a long time}} yet <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> most of <b>your</b> time to looking after the estate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{mean that}} you would be a poor man, were you--were you <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> {{fellowship}} {{and at the same time}} take upon yourself other cares as well. Do as other poor men do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to {{tell you}} how good and sweet I think it was of you <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> cake to the other Ida. That little bit of unselfishness was a good guerdon for your new year." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So like," [...] murmured the old woman, as {{she gazed}} in Slidder's face. [...] "And {{it is so}} good of you <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> play and come to look after a {{helpless}} old creature like me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Captain Cephas fixed {{upon his}} friend an earnest glare. [...] "That's pretty {{considerable}} {{of an idea}} to come upon you so suddint," [...] said he. [...] "But I can tell you one thing: there ain't a-goin' to be any such doin's in my house. If you choose {{to come over here}} <b>to</b> sleep, and <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> house <b>to</b> any woman you can find {{to take care of the}} little gal, all right. But the thing can't be done here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, Bert, {{you might}} just as well hang y'rself, and done with it! Why, it's suicide! I can't allow it. I started in at college bravely, and failed because I'd let it go too long. I couldn't study--couldn't get down to it; but you--why, old man, I'd bet on you!" [...] He had a tremor in his voice. [...] "I hate like thunder <b>to</b> see you <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> plans. Say, you can't afford to do this; it's too much to pay." ...|$|R
6000|$|While he was dictating to Una, Mr. Truax monologized: [...] "I don't {{see why we}} can't {{sell that}} Boutell family a lot. We wouldn't make any profit out of it, now, anyway--that's nearly eaten up by the {{overhead}} we've wasted on them. But I hate <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them <b>up,</b> and <b>your</b> friend Mr. Fein says that we aren't scientific salesmen if we <b>give</b> <b>up</b> the office problems that everybody takes a whack at and seems to fail on." ...|$|R
