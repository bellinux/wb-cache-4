5|$|Chances {{the bill}} would be passed ended in November 2004 when House Republicans in the Pennsylvania General Assembly decided not to bring the bill to a vote. Later that year, Governor Rendell {{released}} US$30 million from the Redevelopment Assistance Budget <b>to</b> <b>Liberty</b> Property Trust. Through the state's Department of Economic and Community Development, Comcast received US$12.75 million that included a US$4-million opportunity grant, US$6.75 million in job-creation tax credits, and US$2 million in job training assistance. Despite the failure to gain KOZ status, the project received US$42.75 million in financial incentives from the state.|$|E
5|$|Common to all {{crimes against}} {{the person is}} the {{infringement}} {{of the right to}} bodily integrity. It extends to the touching of clothing, for example, and where no physical harm actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the right <b>to</b> <b>liberty.</b> It is the very touching, and not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This is related to the right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The central statute on this topic is Offences against the Person Act 1861, which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction and the threat of violence. Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.|$|E
5|$|In the {{parallel}} universe, Walternate's machine has been detected by the Fringe division and Fauxlivia {{and her team}} go to investigate. When Walternate tells them to stand down, Fauxilivia asks him about her recent mission to the prime universe and the part that she recovered. Walternate admits {{to her that the}} machine has been activated, having sacrificed his own son Peter to allow Fauxlivia's son to live. Fauxlivia becomes distressed at Walternate's actions, and later returns <b>to</b> <b>Liberty</b> Island to obtain the devices to allow her to cross to the prime universe, but is caught before she can use them. Walternate locks her away, seeing her as a traitor to his cause.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Walter and Astrid {{determine}} {{that most of}} the effects of the device are occurring in the areas between western Massachusetts and Liberty Islandthe locations of the doomsday machines in the prime and parallel universes respectivelyaligned like iron filings around the ends of a magnet. Walter convinces Broyles to move the device <b>to</b> <b>Liberty</b> Island to reduce the area affected by the strange events. During this time, Peter wakes with confused memories and leaves the hospital, traveling to a location in New York City and buying a silver dollar coin from a pawn shop.|$|E
5|$|The Avalanche's success came amid {{considerable}} {{turmoil in}} the front office. COMSAT's diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company. In particular, cost overruns associated {{with the construction of}} Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms. Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent <b>to</b> <b>Liberty</b> Media. However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} portrays this scene, although {{as usual}} with Matejko's work, it sacrifices some historical reality for more dramatic presentation. It {{serves as an}} allegory for all three Partitions of Poland (1772, 1793, 1795) and portrays {{a number of major}} historical figures of this era. Rejtan is the most visible, occupying the entire right side of the painting, {{in the midst of his}} dramatic pose which has been compared <b>to</b> <b>Liberty</b> Leading the People. His position on this painting exemplifies the golden ratio.|$|E
50|$|The {{constitution}} was not egalitarian by today's standards. It distinguished between the propertied active {{citizens and the}} poorer passive citizens. Women lacked rights <b>to</b> <b>liberties</b> such as education, freedom to speak, write, print and worship.|$|R

5|$|Brought by JC's agents <b>to</b> <b>Liberty</b> Island, Alex {{learns that}} the island holds an old {{part of the}} pre-Collapse {{worldwide}} communication network {{which can be used}} by each faction. No matter what choices Alex has made up to now, they can choose to side with any faction, or kill all the leaders on Liberty Island. If Alex follows JC's plan, the biomods are distributed worldwide, giving Helios the ability to access all human thought, allowing it to govern humanity. If Alex sides with the Illuminati, they use the network to help create a global surveillance state where communication and the economy are controlled. If Alex joins the Templars, they help unite humanity under a theocracy where biomod use and those considered impure are ruthlessly suppressed. Killing all other factions on Liberty Island leads to global chaos, turning Earth into a wasteland dominated by the Omar.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 the Arden Group {{settled with}} One Meridian Plaza's owners E/R Partners {{to pay more}} than US$13 million for the site. In 1999 Arden sued E/R Partners for backing out of a deal Arden said it had made with the site owners. E/R Partners had wanted to sell the site <b>to</b> <b>Liberty</b> Property Trust for a higher amount. Arden had already bought the {{adjacent}} Two Mellon Plaza in 1993. Damaged and vacant since the One Meridian Plaza fire, Two Mellon Plaza was converted into a Ritz-Carlton hotel in 2000. Also adjacent to {{the south side of the}} One Meridian Plaza site is 1441 Chestnut Street. Mariner Commercial Properties bought the property which contained the site of several three-story shops and the eighteen-story Morris Building, all damaged and vacant due to the One Meridian Plaza fire. The buildings were demolished in 2000. The north side of the One Meridian plaza site faces Philadelphia City Hall across the street. While the One Meridian Plaza site waited for development Arden converted it into an underground parking garage.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 {{the group}} moved to WMQM's Millington-based sister station, AM1380 WLRM, and {{switched}} to a nightly schedule, Monday through Friday. Farley left the program in November of that year. Two years later, Geoff Melton, a former co-host, joined to help set up the show's website and the show entered syndication with Dixie Broadcasting Radio Network. The program went on hiatus on February 15, 2008, because staff members said they needed a break, but returned to the airwaves in June 2008 on WLRM on Saturday nights. One year later, it switched from Republic Broadcasting Network <b>to</b> <b>Liberty</b> News Radio Network. As of August 2009, Bonds and Melton are no longer affiliated with the program. Frith now lives in Nashville, Michigan, but remains {{a part of the}} show's staff. Since WLRM is not audited by Arbitron, the show's ratings are unknown. The show is listener-supported and, according to Edwards, receives more donations from Florida than from any other state.|$|E

50|$|In 2005, Thomas Jefferson moved <b>to</b> the <b>Liberty,</b> while Fairfax {{moved to}} the Concorde, and Robinson was moved from the Patriot to the Concorde district.

James Madison was added to the district after being a long standing member of the Liberty District.|$|R
5000|$|You {{say you are}} {{fighting}} for liberty. Yes you {{are fighting}} for liberty: <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> keep four millions of your fellow-beings in ignorance and degradation; - <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> separate parents and children, husband and wife, brother and sister; - <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> steal the products of their labor, exacted with many a cruel lash and bitter tear; - <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> seduce their wives and daughters, and to sell your own children into bondage; - <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> kill these children with impunity, when the murder cannot be proven by one of pure white blood. This {{is the kind of}} liberty - the <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> do wrong - which Satan, Chief of the fallen Angels, was contending for when he was cast into Hell.|$|R
25|$|When Liberty Park {{opened in}} June 2016, the {{question}} {{had not been}} resolved.
