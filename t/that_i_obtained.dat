2500|$|This book {{explains}} Kepler's cosmological theory, {{based on}} the Copernican system, in which the five Pythagorean regular polyhedra dictate {{the structure of the}} universe and reflect God's plan through geometry. This was the first attempt since Copernicus to say that the theory of heliocentrism is physically true. According to Kepler's account from this text, the ratio was brought to his attention accidentally while demonstrating the calculation of the ratio between a circle and a circle created by a rotated inscribed circle. [...] From this he realized that he had stumbled on the same ratio between the orbits of Saturn and Jupiter. [...] He wrote, [...] "I believe it was by divine ordinance <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>obtained</b> by chance that which previously I could not reach by any pains." [...] But after doing further calculations he realized he could not use the two-dimensional polygons to represent all the planets, but instead he had to use the five Platonic solids.|$|E

I thought also <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>obtained</b> it in oil of turpentine, but if {{so it was}} very dull and small.|$|E
60|$|And I {{began to}} be less amazed at the {{circumstance}} that he should possess for wife so beautiful and superb a creature as Madonna Giuliana. I thought <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>obtained</b> glimpses of the charm which that elderly man {{might be able to}} exert upon a fine and cultured young nature with aspirations for things above the commonplace.|$|E

30|$|The results <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>obtain</b> {{are of a}} {{quantitative}} nature. The model economy is first calibrated to mimic some stylized facts of the U.S. economy. Then, the following revenue-neutral tax experiment is run: assuming that aggregate tax revenues are a constant fraction of the economy’s aggregate output, I analyze both the individuals’ and the aggregate economy’s responses to (unannounced) changes in the progressivity of the income tax code. The numerical results obtained are an illustration {{of the effects of}} income tax progressivity upon economic growth, income inequality, and social welfare.|$|R

6000|$|... "However, I {{have one}} {{good reason for}} being obliged to him, since it was through him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>obtained</b> my commission. He told me that, in his young days, {{he had been at}} a French college with the duke. They had been great friends there, and he thought that, in memory of this, de Noailles would procure me a commission." ...|$|E

I think you will consider, sir, that if ever the end justified the means, it did so in this case. Here was something very different from the paltry matter of treason that is alleged against me." ...|$|E
60|$|Again, as he {{bore the}} body from the room, he shot a quick but searching glance toward me, and then his eyes fell once more upon the bald and shiny dome of the dead man in his arms. The last {{fleeting}} glimpse <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>obtained</b> of his profile as he passed from my sight without the chamber revealed a cunning smile of triumph upon his lips.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, Colonel; {{the general}} has {{requested}} me to inform you, at once, {{of the news}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have <b>obtained</b> from a prisoner; namely that, either {{on the night of}} the 30th or 31st, your position will be attacked, by the men who are called the Invulnerables." ...|$|R

By the English Law I shall not, however, be free to marry again till the decree is confirmed six months hence. In the meanwhile I have the honor to ask {{to be considered a}} formal suitor for the hand of your daughter. I shall write again in a few days and beg you both to come and stay at my river house.|$|E
60|$|In {{these first}} days I saw nothing {{of any one}} but Felipe, unless the {{portrait}} is to be counted; and since the lad was plainly of weak mind, and had moments of passion, it may be wondered that I bore his dangerous neighbourhood with equanimity. As a matter of fact, it was for some time irksome; but it happened before long <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>obtained</b> over him so complete a mastery as set my disquietude at rest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{continued}} the lady, smiling, [...] "here the reviewer asserts that Congress {{passed a law}} limiting the size of certain ships, in order to please the democracy; and that the Executive privately evaded this law, and built vessels of a much greater size; whereas the provision {{of the law is}} just the contrary, or that the ships should not be less than of seventy-four guns; a piece of information, by the way, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>obtained</b> from Mr. Powis." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> owned <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had <b>obtained</b> my {{information}} in this way. And <b>I</b> declared <b>that</b> he had expressed his admiration of her, and his belief in her, in terms which made it a subject of regret to me {{not to be able}} to show what he had written.|$|R

"I care not," [...] {{said the}} deserted wife, [...] "what degree of ridicule I may incur; if {{there be any}} one chance out of a hundred <b>that</b> <b>I</b> may <b>obtain</b> some {{certainty}} of my husband's fate, I would not miss that chance for whatever else the world can offer me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I spoke over-confidently when <b>I</b> said <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could <b>obtain</b> you the Vicomte's pardon. There {{proved to}} be a factor on which I had not counted.

60|$|Indescribable was the want of {{hospitality}} which characterised the Hispano-Englishmen of Las Palmas. I have called twice upon a fellow-countryman without his dreaming of asking me upstairs. Such shyness may {{be understood in}} foreigners, who often entertain wild ideas concerning what an Englishman expects. But these people were wealthy; nor were they wholly expatriated. Finally, {{it was with the}} utmost difficulty <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>obtained</b> from one of them a pound of home-grown arrowroot for the sick child of a friend.|$|E
60|$|He {{had counted}} upon my lying {{the night in}} one of the {{intervening}} towns, for the journey was over-long to be accomplished at a stretch, and wherever I might chance to lie, there I should have to reckon with his assassins. The nearer Toulouse--although I knew not this--the thicker grew my danger. Into the very thick of it I rode; in the very thick of it I lay, and all that came of it was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>obtained</b> possession of one more and overwhelming piece of evidence against my murderous Chevalier. But I outrun my story.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And on {{evidence}} so strong,' {{she went on}} quietly, 'that even my father for a moment suspected me, and my dear friend, Mr. Singleton, believed that I had been mixed up in some disgraceful transaction; and others, who I thought knew me well, and would have trusted me, as I know you would have done, believed me guilty--not of theft, but of the previous accusations. There are shopmen in London ready to swear {{in a court of}} law <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>obtained</b> diamonds and other goods from them, and to-morrow fresh charges may be made, and ere long I may stand in the dock as a thief.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, sir. My {{father was}} the only {{surviving}} brother of Sir Wycherly; {{the only one who}} ever married; and I am his eldest child. Since this melancholy event has occurred, it is quite fortunate <b>that</b> <b>I</b> lately <b>obtained</b> this certificate of the marriage of my parents--is it not, sir?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will try}} to do so, Colonel," [...] the lad said, in a low voice, [...] "and I am {{grateful}} indeed for the kindness that you have shown me. I have always hoped <b>that</b> some day <b>I</b> might <b>obtain</b> a commission in your regiment, but never even hoped {{that it would be}} until after I had done something to deserve it. Indeed I did not think that it was even possible <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could <b>obtain</b> a commission until----" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{remember}} his {{talking to me}} more than once {{on the subject of}} his father, and especially his remarking on one occasion that his friends were pressing him to come out there oftener, and suggesting, when he seemed out of health and spirits, that he was not taking care of himself; but that it was the anguish he endured, as night after night he lay awake thinking of his father gradually sinking and craving for him, and cheerfully resigning him, that really told upon him. I know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>obtained</b> then a glimpse of an affection and a depth of sorrow such as perfectly awed me, and I do not think I have witnessed anything like it at all, either before or since. It was then that he seemed to enter into the full meaning of those words of our Lord, in St. Mark x. 29-30, i.e., into all that the [...] "leaving" [...] there spoken of involved.' ...|$|E
60|$|The country {{round about}} Bessir was very hilly and rugged, bristling with jagged and honey-combed coralline rocks, and with curious little chasms and ravines. The paths often passed through these rocky clefts, {{which in the}} depths of the forest were gloomy and dark in the extreme, and often full of fine-leaved {{herbaceous}} plants and curious blue-foliaged Lycopodiaceae. It was in such places as these <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>obtained</b> many of my most beautiful small butterflies, such as Sospita statira and Taxila pulchra, the gorgeous blue Amblypodia hercules, and many others. On the skirts of the plantations I found the handsome blue Deudorix despoena, and in the shady woods the lovely Lycaena wallacei. Here, too, I obtained the beautiful Thyca aruna, of the richest orange on the upper side; while below it is intense crimson and glossy black; and a superb specimen of a green Ornithoptera, absolutely fresh and perfect, and which still remains one of the glories of my cabinet.|$|E
6000|$|Through ignorance {{which might}} have cost me dear but for friend Larking's weight with the local authorities, I had {{neglected}} to provide myself with a passport in England, {{and it was not}} without difficulty, involving much unclean dressing and an unlimited expenditure of broken English, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>obtained</b> from H.B.M's Consul at Alexandria a certificate, declaring me to be an Indo-British subject named Abdullah, by profession a doctor, aged thirty, and not distinguished-at least so the frequent blanks seemed to denote-by any remarkable conformation of eyes, nose, or cheek. For this I disbursed a dollar. And here let me record the indignation with which I did it. That mighty Britain-the mistress of the seas-the ruler of one-sixth of mankind-should charge five shillings to pay for the shadow of her protecting wing! That I cannot speak my modernised [...] "civis sum Romanus" [...] without putting my hand into my pocket, in order that these officers of the Great Queen may not take too ruinously from a revenue of seventy millions! O the meanness of our magnificence! the littleness of our greatness! ...|$|E
60|$|As they {{approached}} the Custer fight, however, they paused, pondered, checked up one another's statements, and at last produced what I {{believed to be the}} truth regarding the share in that battle--and the truth is incredible.

60|$|I {{have not}} as yet noticed {{by far the}} most {{remarkable}} feature in the natural history of this archipelago; it is, that the different islands to a considerable extent are inhabited by a different set of beings. My attention was first called to this fact by the Vice-Governor, Mr. Lawson, declaring that the tortoises differed from the different islands, and that he could with certainty tell from which island any one was brought. I did not for some time pay sufficient attention to this statement, and I had already partially mingled together the collections from two of the islands. I never dreamed that islands, about 50 or 60 miles apart, and most of them in sight of each other, formed of precisely the same rocks, placed under a quite similar climate, rising to a nearly equal height, would have been differently tenanted; but we shall soon see that this is the case. It is the fate of most voyagers, no sooner to discover what is most interesting in any locality, than they are hurried from it; but I ought, perhaps, to be thankful <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>obtained</b> sufficient materials to establish this most remarkable fact in the distribution of organic beings.|$|E
60|$|I {{have rarely}} enjoyed myself more than during my {{residence}} here. As I sat taking my coffee at {{six in the}} morning, rare birds would often be seen on some tree close by, when I would hastily sally out in my slippers, and perhaps secure a prize I had been seeking after for weeks. The great hornbills of Celebes (Buceros cassidix) would often come with loud-flapping wings, and perch upon a lofty tree {{just in front of}} me; and the black baboon-monkeys, Cynopithecus nigrescens, often stared down in astonishment at such an intrusion into their domains while at night herds of wild pigs roamed about the house, devouring refuse, and obliging us to put away everything eatable or breakable from our little cooking-house. A few minutes' search on the fallen trees around my house at sunrise and sunset, would often produce me more beetles than I would meet with in a day's collecting, and odd moments could be made valuable which when living in villages or at a distance from the forest are inevitably wasted. Where the sugar-palms were dripping with sap, flies congregated in immense numbers, and it was by spending half an hour at these when I had the time to spare, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>obtained</b> the finest and most remarkable collection of this group of insects that I have ever made.|$|E
60|$|When I {{arrived at}} the mines, on the 14th of March, I had {{collected}} in the four preceding months, 320 different kinds of beetles. In less than a fortnight I had doubled this number, {{an average of about}} 24 new species every day. On one day I collected 76 different kinds, of which 34 were new to me. By the end of April I had more than a thousand species, and they then went on increasing at a slower rate, so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>obtained</b> altogether in Borneo about two thousand distinct kinds, of which all but about a hundred were collected at this place, and on scarcely more than a square mile of ground. The most numerous and most interesting groups of beetles were the Longicorns and Rhynchophora, both pre-eminently wood-feeders. The former, characterised by their graceful forms and long antenna, were especially numerous, amounting to nearly three hundred species, nine-tenths of which were entirely new, and many of them remarkable for their large size, strange forms, and beautiful colouring. The latter correspond to our weevils and allied groups, and in the tropics are exceedingly numerous and varied, often swarming upon dead timber, so that I sometimes obtained fifty or sixty different kinds in a day. My Bornean collections of this group exceeded five hundred species.|$|E
