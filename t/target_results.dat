25|$|Priha 9, February 12 - 201 Squadron Phantoms attack Egyptian radar {{facilities}} at Jebel Obeid, while a 69 Squadron pair {{is sent to}} attack army bases at Hanca. Mistaken identification of the <b>target</b> <b>results</b> in the bombing of a metal foundry at Abu Zabel and the killing of 70 Egyptian workers. Israeli defence minister Moshe Dayan informs Egyptian authorities, through the Red Cross, of a delayed detonation bomb at the site, and the Israeli government prohibits strikes against targets within a range of 20km {{from the center of}} Cairo. Later in the day, two 201 Squadron F-4s strike army bases at Dahshur again, while a 69 Squadron pair destroys a radar facility at Abu Suweir.|$|E

50|$|The {{second stage}} is where players attempt to hit their ball within a target circle from 4 {{different}} locations. Hitting within the <b>target</b> <b>results</b> in 2 points and holing the shot results in 10 points. If they miss, {{they can choose}} to take a mulligan and hit the shot again {{at the cost of}} 1 point, or they can choose to stop. They can have up to two mulligans.|$|E

50|$|As {{the teeth}} of the {{rotating}} wheel (or other target features) pass by the face of the magnet, the amount of magnetic flux passing through the magnet and consequently the coil varies. When the gear tooth is close to the sensor, the flux is at a maximum. When the tooth is further away, the flux drops off. The moving <b>target</b> <b>results</b> in a time-varying flux that induces a proportional voltage in the coil. Subsequent electronics are then used to process this signal to get a digital waveform that can be more readily counted and timed.|$|E

50|$|The energy {{amplifier}} first uses {{a particle}} accelerator (e.g. linac, synchrotron, cyclotron or FFAG) {{to produce a}} beam of high-energy (relativistic) protons. The beam is directed to smash into the nuclei of a heavy metal target, such as lead, thorium or uranium. Inelastic collisions between the proton beam and the <b>target</b> <b>results</b> in spallation, which produces twenty to thirty neutrons per event. It {{might be possible to}} increase the neutron flux {{through the use of a}} neutron amplifier, a thin film of fissile material surrounding the spallation source; the use of neutron amplification in CANDU reactors has been proposed. While CANDU is a critical design, many of the concepts can be applied to a sub-critical system. Thorium nuclei absorb neutrons, thus breeding fissile uranium-233, an isotope of uranium which is not found in nature. Moderated neutrons produce U-233 fission, releasing energy.|$|E
50|$|An econometric {{analysis}} by University of Greenwich economists found that although inflation <b>targeting</b> <b>results</b> in higher economic growth, {{it does not}} necessarily guarantee stability based on their study of 36 emerging economies from 1979 to 2009.|$|R
5000|$|Giesbrecht and Di Lollo (1998) [...] {{suggest that}} the attentional blink over <b>target</b> 2 <b>results</b> when the person is busy {{processing}} target 1.

50|$|In a sense, ICM is {{the same}} effect as (intentional) single-exposition motion blur: {{in the former the}} camera moves during exposure, in the second the target moves, but they have in common that there is {{relative}} motion between camera and <b>target,</b> <b>resulting</b> in streaking in the image.|$|R
50|$|A 2007 article {{published}} in The Industrial-Organizational Psychologist, by Jesse S. Michel from Michigan State University, applied Stanley Milgram’s small world phenomenon (i.e., “small world problem”) {{to the field of}} I-O psychology through co-author publication linkages. Following six criteria, Scott Highhouse (Bowling Green State University professor and fellow of the Society of Industrial and Organizational Psychology) was chosen as the target. Co-author publication linkages were determined for (1) top authors within the I-O community, (2) quasi-random faculty members of highly productive I-O programs in North America, and (3) publication trends of the <b>target.</b> <b>Results</b> suggest that the small world phenomenon is alive and well with mean linkages of 3.00 to top authors, mean linkages of 2.50 to quasi-random faculty members, and a relatively broad and non-repetitive set of co-author linkages for the target. The author then provided a series of implications and suggestions for future research.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDetecting a {{pedestrian}} while {{driving in the}} fog is one situation where the prior expectation about the target presence is integrated with the noisy visual input. We focus on how these sources of information influence the oculomotor behavior and are integrated within an underlying decision-making process. The participants had to judge whether high-/low-density fog scenes displayed {{on a computer screen}} contained {{a pedestrian}} or a deer by executing a mouse movement toward the response button (mouse-tracking). A variable road sign was added on the scene to manipulate expectations about target identity. We then analyzed the timing and amplitude of the deviation of mouse trajectories toward the incorrect response and, using an eye tracker, the detection time (before fixating the target) and the identification time (fixations on the <b>target).</b> <b>Results</b> revealed that expectation of the correct <b>target</b> <b>results</b> in earlier decisions with less deviation toward the alternative response, this effect being partially explained by the facilitation of target identification...|$|E
