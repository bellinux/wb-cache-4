This study aimed to determine the incidence trend of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (SPPT) in sub-age and sex groups during the years of 1995 - 2012. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was performed in 2015 by using the dataset regarding National Statistics of SPPT reported by World Health Organization during 1995 - 2012. Annual percent changes (APCs) and average annual percent changes (AAPCs) were estimated to determine <b>the</b> <b>summery</b> statistics <b>of</b> trend using segmented regression model. Results: During 1995 - 2012, there were 96, 579 SPPT case notifications in Iran (male to female ratio: 0. 99).

40|$|It {{seems to}} the writer that much less {{attention}} has been paid on the financial aspect of insurance business. Indeed, the financial business of any insurance company is a secondary one that is derived from its proper operation, but it does never justify neglecting or disregarding this business aspect of insurance companies. Virtually none would deny that they are financial institutions, especially so life insurance companies. The writer is much interested in the relationship between economic growth and the pattern of investment of life insurance fund. Can life insurance fund play any role in the process of economic growth? What type of effect does the pattern of the use of life insurance fund have on the path of economic growth, if any? The {{purpose of this paper is}} to answer these questions empirically on the basis of statistical data. This work is to be accomplished in three step procedure. (1) to realize the nature of life insurance fund through analyzing the insurance business of the most ordinary sort in which life insurance companies are engaged in the present time. (2) to lighten the characteristics of the economic growth in the cost-war period in our country. (3) to provide some policy implication to the problem which pattern of investment of life insurance companies should be prefered to neutralize undesirable effect of the growth. <b>The</b> <b>summery</b> <b>of</b> the argument is as follows. The liability of life insurance companies is in its nature long term, and consequently to the assets of the companies high liquidity is not required. On the other hand, the growth of our economy in the post-war period has been continued at astonishingly high rate at the cost of inflation in virture of vast credit creation of commercial banks. As a result, the capital structure of business firms as a whole has been deteriorated verv much. The ratio of equity to debt in capital structure has become from 6 : 4 before the World War II, to 4 : 6 in the post war time. This is the most undesirable effect of the growth at high rate. To neutralize such an effect, it is necessary to enlarge the stock market in our country, and make the access of firms to it easier. Life insurance companies would render much contribution to the attempt of enlarging the stock market, if they decide to increase their stock investment within the limit provided by law at least...|$|E

The infrared – Thermographycamera “Varioscan-Compact 3011 ” {{was used for the}} thermographic examination. Both front legs of 61 horses were examined, 32 wich had received diagnostic anaesthesia injections as part of a complete lameness exam. 20 other horses included in this study had received neurectomy of the Nn. digitales mediales and laterales at differing times. The control group consisted of nine sound, healthy horses. In the evaluation the absolute temperature of bodysurface of the limbs was established and the temperature difference between corresponding regions of the front legs was assessed. The results of the study can be summoned as follows: 1. The sound horses showed a symmetrical distribution of the temperature of the bodysurface on both front legs. 2. Horses that received diagnostic anaesthetic injections showed a significant increase of temperature after the injections with a peak at 30 minutes post injectionem. A difference between varying groups of anaesthesia was not detectable. That means neither the time of the temperature increase nor the level of temperature difference showed a dependency on the amount of injected local anaesthesia. The most considerable changes in temperature were obvious in the fetlock region, the slightest changes in the region of the hoof. 3. Horses that received a neurectomy revealed an obvious connection between the symmetry of the temperature distribution and the date of the surgery. Horses that had received a neurectomy two to eight weeks before the thermographic examination showed a considerable divergence in the symmetry of temperature distribution. In the horses, whose surgery took place six months to five years ago, no explicit differences in the temperature distribution were detectable with the exeption of two horses. In one proband the limb that received neurectomy and the other horse the healthy limb was considerably warmer than the contralateral extremity. However the absolute temperature of the bodysurface of those two horses was within the physiological limits. Temperatures changes on the bodysurface of the front legs afterbdiagnostic anaesthesia or neurectomycan be detected and accounted for by thermography. However a neurectomy seems to cause a considerable divergence in <b>the</b> <b>summery</b> <b>of</b> the temperature distribution for just a certain period of time. Just six month after surgery only a few corresponding limbs showed a divergence of temperature of more than 1 °C.

40|$|How {{toddlers}} {{with special}} needs adjust to the daycare setting A multiple case study of how the relationships with adults and children are built The aim {{in this study is}} to describe how toddlers {{with special needs}} adjust to daycare. The emotional well-being and involvement in daycare activities of toddlers are especially investigated in this study. The relationship and how it is built between an adult and a child, a child and a child is examined. The daycare is examined through the socio-cultural theory as a pedagogical institution, where the child adapts by participating in social and cultural activities with the others. The development of the child {{is the result of the}} experiences that are gained through the constant relationship between the child, the family and social context. By the attachment theory the inner self-regulation, that allows the child safely adapt to new situations, develops most in the relationship between the child under 3 years of age and the attending adult. The relationships between toddlers in daycare are usually built by the coincidental encounters in play and daily activities. In these relationships, the toddler gets the information of themselves and the other children. The complexity of the rules in the setting that organize the social action is challenging for the children and they need constant support from the adults. The participants of the study were five toddlers with special needs. When applying to daycare they were less than three years old and they got the specialist statement for their special needs, and the reference for daycare. The children were observed by recording their attending in the daycare once in the 3 - 4 months from the first day in daycare. Approximately 15 hours of material that was analysed with the Transana-program. The qualitative material was analysed by first collecting a descriptive model that explains and theorises the phenomenon. By <b>the</b> <b>summery</b> <b>of</b> the narrative it is placed a hypothesis that is tested by quantitative methods using correlations and variance analyses and general linear modeling that is used to count the differences between repeated measures and connections between different variables. The results of the study are built theoretically for the consistent conception between the theory and the findings in research. The toddlers in the study were all dependent on the support given by the adults in all the situations in the daycare. They could not associate with the other children without the support of the adults and their involvement in activities was low. The engagement of an adult in interaction was necessary for the children’s involvement in activities, and the co-operation with the other children. The engagement of teachers was statistically significantly higher than the engagement of other professions. Pienet, alle kolmevuotiaat lapset, tarvitsevat erityisen paljon aikuisen hoivaa ja opetusta päiväkodissa. Monitapaustutkimuksessa Erityistä tukea tarvitsevan taaperon päiväkotiryhmään sopeutuminen seurattiin viiden lapsen päiväkotiryhmään liittymistä ensimmäisen päiväkotivuoden aikana. Tutkimuksen taaperot olivat erittäin riippuvaisia aikuisilta saamastaan tuesta kaikissa päivähoidon arki- ja leikkitilanteissa. Kasvattajien herkkyys tunnistaa lasten tarpeita ja tukea lapsia heidän toiminnoissaan nousi merkittävämmäksi tekijäksi lasten toimintaan sitoutuneisuudessa ja lasten välisen yhteisen toiminnan rakentumisessa. Tutkimustulokset osoittavat, että aikuiset eivät olleet riittävän herkkiä havaitsemaan lasten tarpeita ja tukemaan heitä sosiaalisissa tilanteissa. Koulutus näytti kuitenkin vahvistavan aikuisten taitoa toimia lasten kanssa, koska opettajien sitoutuminen vuorovaikutukseen oli korkeampaa kuin muiden ammattiryhmien sitoutuminen. Tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan päiväkotia sosiokulttuurisen teorian mukaan kasvatusinstituutiona, johon lapsi sopeutuu osallistumalla sen sosiaaliseen ja kulttuuriseen toimintaan yhtenä ryhmän jäsenenä. Lapsia havainnoitiin videoimalla heidän päiväkotipäiviänsä 3 - 4 kuukauden välein aloittamispäivästä alkaen. Lapsia havainnoimalla on tallennettu heidän ryhmätilanteisiin liittyviä tarinoita. Tarinoiden yksityiskohtia on käsitelty tilastollisin menetelmin, jotta tärkeät ilmiöt nousisivat vakuuttavasti esille. Tämä tutkimus vahvistaa käsitystä vuorovaikutuksen ainutlaatuisesta merkityksestä lapsen hyvinvoinnissa. Kiinnittämällä huomiota tapaan olla lapsen kanssa ja säädellä hänen olojaan voidaan päivähoidossa ennaltaehkäistä sosio- emotionaalisten haittojen kasautumista.

40|$|Childbirth is a {{physiological}} activity, every {{woman who is}} planning a baby, she must also prepare for this process. Unfortunately, many women have a great fear of childbirth. Whether this fear relates to an unknowen environment, or the willingness or unwillingness of medical staff, so it usually refers to the fear of pain, which is inevitable in childbirth. Some women are supporters of Unmitigated pain, but {{we live in the}} 21 st century, where the history of medicine got progressed very forward. And so, it is possible to allow the woman natural childbirth, but also women can be easily remedied from the pain, and I think that a woman need not be ashamed that, she {{would like to have a}} rest during this process, which is made possible thanks to analgesia, but also leads birth to a successful conclusion. Another fear that accompanies women in childbirth is fear of the baby. Most women also rejects painkiller because of negative effects on the child. Of course, there is quite extensive choice in pharmaceutical market of how to relieve the pain of women in childbirth. The most commonly used and most popular among women is epidural analgesia, or infusion of semi-synthetic opioid nalbuphine. When using the infusion solution application is the easiest. If women choose epidural analgesia, the next question from women is if the application hurts and what the risks are. It is well known among the public that this method is invasive, but it has demonstrable effects. Another option is the inhalation of nitrous oxide, which this purely theoretical treatment thesis is dedicated. The task of this thesis is to do <b>the</b> <b>summery</b> <b>of</b> the latest information. Which contains both positive aspects and negative aspects that this product carries. In this work I also presented places abroad where the use of this product is big, but also places like the USA, where the product is not used. In the Czech Republic there are hospitals which offer this analgesic method, but usage is relatively small or none. But there are hospitals where this product is in high demand. The greatest demand for this type of analgesia is at suture birth injury. In this case the composition is typically placed on a doctor and is free. But there are, of course, hospitals where you have to pay for it. Prices in our country are very different. But it is clear that this analgesia is a golden center. It has an easy application, the effect is not as comparable as with epidural analgesia, but it is completely non-invasive. Thanks to its analgesic effect stress in mothers is also releasing and the course of childbirth can improve. If a woman does not want to use this analgesia during labor, it can be selected at the suture of birth injury and the effect will be guaranteed. A significant problem in our country is that this product is not covered by health insurance. There are hospitals where epidural analgesia is charged. In contrast, the laughing gas is unknown to the public. Although there is INKA program in the Czech Republic that I have also mentioned in my work and which is intended to raise public awareness of analgesia during labor. Apart from information about nitrous oxide analgesia I have mentioned childbirth management and pain management in my theoretical thesis. In these chapters I deal with the management of childbirth at different diagnoses, as well as the leadership of birth from the perspective of the famous French obstetrician Leboyera Odent. I tried to create the whole concept work so that the individual chapters follow, because I think that childbirth pain and subsequent pain is very common. I mentioned an intresting thing in pain management which is hypnosis during childbirth. This method is also a novelty within the obstetrical analgesia, but it depends on the susceptibility and the readiness of women to use this method in practice. Susceptibility of women is also very important in the application of any analgesic methods in childbirth...|$|E
