5|$|Justice Simpson's {{report was}} tabled in the House of Representatives on 28 June 1951 {{by the new}} Minister for Civil Aviation, Larry Anthony. The Inquiry found that the Amana {{suffered}} <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of engine power {{on at least one}} occasion, followed by rapid loss of height until it struck the ground. However, the evidence did not allow the court to determine the cause of the <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of engine power. Consequently, the court was unable to determine the cause of the accident. Simpson stated he was satisfied water had not been introduced into the Amana's fuel system in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide or Perth.|$|E

5|$|A 2007–2008 {{survey of}} over 19% of all colonies {{revealed}} a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of 35.8%. Operations that pollinated almonds lost, on average, {{the same number}} of colonies as those that did not. The 37.9% of operations that reported having at least some of their colonies die with a complete lack of bees had a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of 40.8% of colonies compared to the 17.1% loss reported by beekeepers without this symptom. Large operations {{were more likely to have}} this symptom, suggesting a contagious condition may be a causal factor. About 60% of all colonies that were reported dead in this survey died without the presence of dead bees in the hive, thus possibly suffered from CCD.|$|E

5|$|Devotional art {{before the}} Reformation {{included}} books and images commissioned in the Netherlands. Before the Reformation in the mid-sixteenth century the interiors of Scottish churches were often elaborate and colourful, with sacrament houses and monumental effigies.

5|$|The <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of life {{resulting}} from Pontiac's War is unknown. About 400 British {{soldiers were killed}} in action and perhaps 50 were captured and tortured to death. George Croghan estimated that 2,000 settlers had been killed or captured, a figure sometimes repeated as 2,000 settlers killed. The violence compelled approximately 4,000 settlers from Pennsylvania and Virginia to flee their homes. Native American losses went mostly unrecorded.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of Lone Grove, the area north of Ardmore was also hard hit. Several buildings, {{including}} those of the Beaver Academy and the Ardmore Adventist Academy, were destroyed.

40|$|Purpose. To obtain {{relations}} {{determining the}} components of the <b>total</b> <b>losses</b> power with p-q-r power theory for three-phase four-wire energy supply systems, uniquely linking four components: the lowest possible losses power, losses power caused by the reactive power, losses power caused by the instantaneous active power pulsations, losses power caused by current flowing in the neutral wire. Methodology. We have applied concepts of p-q-r power theory, the theory of electrical circuits and mathematical simulation in Matlab package. Results. We have obtained the exact relation, which allows to calculate the <b>total</b> <b>losses</b> power in the three-phase four-wire energy supply system using three components corresponding to the projections of the generalized vectors of voltage and current along the pqr axis coordinates. Originality. For the first time, we have established a mathematical relationship between spatial representation of instantaneous values of the vector components and the <b>total</b> <b>losses</b> power in the three-phase four-wire energy supply systems. Practical value. We have elucidated an issue that using the proposed methodology would create a measuring device for determining the current value of {{the components of}} <b>total</b> <b>losses</b> power in three-phase systems. The device operates with measuring information about instantaneous values of currents and voltages...|$|R
5|$|Brain death {{refers to}} an {{irreversible}} <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of brain function. This is characterised by coma, loss of reflexes, and apnoea, however, the declaration of brain death varies geographically and is not always accepted. In some countries {{there is also a}} defined syndrome of brainstem death. Declaration of brain death can have profound implications as the declaration, under the principle of medical futility, will be associated with the withdrawal of life support, and as those with brain death often have organs suitable for organ donation. The process is often made more difficult by poor communication with patients' families.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane was {{transferred}} to the North America and West Indies station in November 1917, but rejoined the 2nd Cruiser Squadron early in 1918. She was based in Murmansk between March and September 1918 during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. She ferried Soviet troops to Pechenga on 3 May to forestall an attempt by White Finns to seize the town. On 14 November 1918 she was stranded in the Mersey Estuary, while {{under the control of the}} pilot, and later broke in two, becoming a <b>total</b> <b>loss.</b> The wreck had been broken up in situ by June 1919.|$|E
5|$|During {{the sixteenth}} century, Scotland {{underwent}} a Protestant Reformation {{that created a}} predominantly Calvinist national Church of Scotland (kirk), which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook. Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll {{as a result of}} Protestant iconoclasm, with the almost <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings. The nature of the Scottish Reformation may have had wider effects, limiting the creation of a culture of public display and meaning that art was channelled into more austere forms of expression with an emphasis on private and domestic restraint.|$|E
