5|$|Acid2 was {{designed}} with Microsoft Internet Explorer particularly in mind. The creators of Acid2 were dismayed that Internet Explorer {{did not follow}} web standards. It was prone to display web pages differently from other browsers, causing web developers to spend time tweaking <b>their</b> <b>web</b> pages. Acid2 challenged Microsoft to make Internet Explorer comply with web standards.|$|E
5|$|Listeners often obtain QSL cards (which confirm contact) from ham operators, {{broadcasters}} or utility stations as trophies of the hobby. Traditionally, listeners {{would send}} {{letters to the}} station with reception reports and requests for schedules. Many stations now accept E-mails or provide reception report forms on <b>their</b> <b>Web</b> sites. Reception reports give valuable information about propagation and interference to a station's engineers.|$|E
5|$|Spiders {{can also}} be the prey of {{aggressive}} mimics. The assassin bug Stenolemus bituberus preys on spiders, entering <b>their</b> <b>web</b> and plucking its silk threads until the spider approaches. This vibrational aggressive mimicry matches a general pattern of vibrations which spiders treat as prey, having a similar temporal structure and amplitude to leg and body movements of typical prey caught in the web.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{there are}} spiders. They {{frequently}} show the greatest skill and cunning {{in the construction}} of <b>their</b> <b>webs</b> and the capture of their prey, and naturalists say that the spider has a very well developed brain. They must certainly have a geometrical talent, or they could not arrange <b>their</b> <b>webs</b> with such regularity and scientific accuracy. Some spiders will throw <b>their</b> <b>webs</b> across streams that are quite wide.|$|R
50|$|They {{are common}} in gardens and low vegetation. They often build <b>their</b> <b>webs</b> among bushes.|$|R
50|$|Males also build orb webs, often {{near the}} <b>webs</b> of females. <b>Their</b> <b>webs</b> are usually smaller.|$|R
5|$|There {{has been}} no new {{material}} since 2001, but reprints of the strip have appeared online and in print. The Roy of the Rovers website has archived all of the Match of the Day years' material, in addition to excerpts from other classic strips. In October 2007, Setanta bought the original strips, which they featured on <b>their</b> <b>web</b> site.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is common}} amongst spiders, both in luring prey and stealthily {{approaching}} predators. One {{case is the}} golden orb weaver (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see. Other colors were also learned and avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow pigmented webs with danger. Yellow {{is the color of}} many nectar bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worth while. Another form of mimicry is based not on color but pattern. Species such as Argiope argentata employ prominent patterns {{in the middle of their}} webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change <b>their</b> <b>web</b> day to day, which can be explained by bees' ability to remember web patterns. Bees are able to associate a certain pattern with a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.|$|E
25|$|Sites {{also often}} aim to {{increase}} <b>their</b> <b>web</b> traffic through inclusion on search engines and through search engine optimization.|$|E
5|$|P. fimbriata in {{all regions}} fix <b>their</b> own <b>webs</b> to solid {{surfaces}} such as rocks and tree trunks and boughs, while some other Portia species often fix <b>their</b> <b>webs</b> to pliant stems and leaves {{and on the}} lower branches of trees.|$|R

25|$|Other {{studies suggest}} that the stabilimenta may {{actually}} lead predators to the spider; species such as A. keyserlingi place <b>their</b> <b>web</b> predominantly in closed, complex habitats such as among sedges.|$|E
50|$|C. lyoni {{are active}} hunters. Hanging upside down, they will quickly capture prey caught in <b>their</b> {{irregular}} cobweb-like <b>webs.</b> If hungry enough, they also actively pursue prey that fly close to <b>their</b> <b>webs.</b> They {{do not use}} their fangs when hunting, throwing silk over prey instead and then wrapping them loosely using their hind legs. They will only bite them when they start to feed, which can sometimes be as long as six days after capture. They also actively clean <b>their</b> <b>webs</b> by removing carcasses regularly. When webs become too dirty, they build new ones.|$|R

25|$|The {{hobo spider}} (Eratigena agrestis, {{formerly}} Tegenaria agrestis) {{is a member}} of the genus of spiders known colloquially as funnel web spiders, but not to be confused with the Australian funnel-web spider. The medical significance of its bite is still poorly understood and debated. Individuals construct a funnel-shaped structure of silk sheeting and lie in wait at the small end of the funnel for prey insects to blunder onto <b>their</b> <b>webs.</b> Hobo spiders sometimes build <b>their</b> <b>webs</b> in or around human habitations.|$|R

25|$|As these spiders live in {{constant}} proximity to humans, {{they are not}} usually aggressive and will even let a human hand approach <b>their</b> <b>web.</b> Like any other spider, however, {{they are afraid of}} bigger foes, and, in most cases, will retreat behind an obstacle (such as a dried leaf or prey remains) upon perceiving more than usual disturbance to <b>their</b> <b>web.</b> Further disturbance may lead to the spider dropping down on a thread, then running away from the web. If the distance is not considerable, it will usually return to its web within a couple of days. Otherwise, it will start a new one.|$|E

25|$|Aggressive mimicry {{need not}} involve {{the sense of}} vision. For example, the assassin bug preys on spiders, {{entering}} <b>their</b> <b>web</b> and plucking its silk threads.
