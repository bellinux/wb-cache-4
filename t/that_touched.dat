5|$|For the 13tornadoes <b>that</b> <b>touched</b> {{down from}} the parent {{supercell}} in southern Minnesota, the Twin Cities and Sioux Falls NWS offices issued tornado warnings an average of 15minutes before the warned areas were hit. Because of above-average lead time for the warnings, and for excellence in forecasting the entire event, a bronze medal was issued to the Twin Cities NWS office the following December by the United States Department of Commerce.|$|E

A crowd of 60,135 {{people showed up}} to see the Browns beat the Miami Seahawks 44–0, then a record attendance mark for professional football. <b>That</b> <b>touched</b> off a string of wins; the team ended the season with a 12–2 record and the top spot in the AAFC's western division. The Browns then beat the AAFC's New York Yankees in the championship.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of July 16, 1904, a severe thunderstorm produced a strong tornado <b>that</b> <b>touched</b> down around 3:30pm EST in Chappaqua, New York. Residents reported the first indication of the thunderstorm was a large black cloud approaching the region. The sky was reportedly completely dark as torrential rain and high winds commenced. Intense lightning and loud thunder prompted people to seek shelter in their cellars. The tornado tracked directly through Chappaqua before moving towards the Hudson River. Upon reaching the river, the tornado became a waterspout that was powerful enough to uncover the river bed below it. The waterspout eventually dissipated by 4:00pm EST. The tornado was later rated as F3 on the modern-day Fujita scale.|$|E

Roger was suspended by Pope Alexander III because he was implicated in Becket's death, but was restored to office on 16 December 1171.|$|E

5|$|Since it {{initially}} moved little, Bret brought prolonged overcast {{conditions to}} much of the northern Bahamas, with most of the activity over the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama. An estimated 3 in (75mm) of precipitation fell in Abaco over the weekend of July 1617. In addition, a weather station on the island reported gale-force gusting of up to 48mph (77km/h) {{at the height of the}} storm. The rain led to the cancellation of a local Little League baseball match. Outer rainbands spawned a waterspout <b>that</b> <b>touched</b> down on eastern Paradise Island, accompanied by lightning strikes and torrents. Nevertheless, locals considered the storm's impact to be generally positive, as its rains aided in alleviating mild drought conditions across the nation.|$|E
5|$|The Bridge Creek–Moore tornado {{was part}} of a much larger outbreak, which {{produced}} 71 tornadoes across five states throughout the Central Plains on May 3 alone, along with an additional 25 <b>that</b> <b>touched</b> down a day later in some of the areas affected by the previous day's activity (some of which were spawned supercells that developed on the evening of May 3), stretching eastward to the Mississippi River Valley. On the morning of May 3, in its Day 1 Convective Outlook for the United States, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a slight risk for severe weather, as a dry line that stretched from western Kansas into western Texas approached a warm, humid air-mass over the Central Plains; the conditions ahead of the dry line and a connecting trough positioned over northeastern Colorado appeared to favor the development of thunderstorms later that day that would contain large hail, damaging straight-line winds, and isolated tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|The November 2008 Carolinas tornado {{outbreak}} was a {{brief but}} deadly tornado outbreak which began shortly after midnight (local time), while many people were sleeping. Most of the eight tornadoes <b>that</b> <b>touched</b> down were produced by two supercell thunderstorms over North Carolina. At 12:25a.m. EST, the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for most of eastern North Carolina as the risk of tornadoes increased. Not long after, the first tornado of the outbreak, an EF2, touched down in South Carolina. Almost an hour later, the second tornado touched down in Robeson County, North Carolina. Three other minor tornadoes, two EF0 and an EF1, touched down {{over the next two}} hours. Around 3:10a.m. EST, the first of two killer tornadoes touched down near Kenly, North Carolina. The EF2 tornado destroyed a few homes and damaged several others. Roughly 20 minutes later, an EF3 tornado touched down in Wilson County. This tornado killed one person and injured a few others after destroying several homes. Total damages from the outbreak amounted to $2.5million, about half of which was a result of the EF3 tornado.|$|E

5|$|The Storm Prediction Center {{received}} 292 {{reports of}} tornadoes {{in the preceding}} 24 hours. It broke {{the record for the}} most tornado touchdowns in 24 hours with 219 in the United States from midnight to midnight CDT (0500 – 0500 UTC) breaking the 24-hour record of 147 (in both totals, excluding confirmed tornadoes outside the United States that were part of the outbreak) set by the 1974 Super Outbreak. Of those 219 tornadoes, 59 touched down in Alabama and 79 hit the ground in Tennessee, accounting for well over half of the tornadoes <b>that</b> <b>touched</b> down on April 27. On April 27 alone, the National Weather Service in Huntsville, Alabama issued 92 tornado warnings, 31 severe thunderstorm warnings, and seven flash flood warnings.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{during the}} month of March are an unusual {{occurrence}} in Minnesota when compared {{to the rest of the}} spring and summer months. Before this event there had been only six tornadoes ever recorded in the state during March, and since this event there has been only six. This outbreak also marks the first time in Minnesota history that two tornadoes were recorded on the same day in March, as well as the first time since 1921 that there have been multiple tornado fatalities on the same March day. Despite the historical significance of the outbreak, this was not the earliest calendar-year tornado to touch down in Minnesota; that record is held by three tornadoes <b>that</b> <b>touched</b> on March 6, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} initial tornado dissipated, a new {{circulation}} rapidly developed {{to the east of}} the old one. This new circulation produced a tornado <b>that</b> <b>touched</b> down at the Union University campus in Jackson, almost immediately intensifying into a violent EF4 and causing tremendous damage. Several large, brick, two-story dormitory buildings sustained major structural damage, two of which completely collapsed. 80% of the dormitory buildings on campus were damaged or destroyed, and hundreds of vehicles were damaged or destroyed in the parking lots around campus. Twelve students at the university were trapped in damaged buildings but all were eventually rescued. Due to the damage, the university was closed until February 18. Past Union University, the tornado weakened slightly and maintained EF3 strength along the remainder of the path. It tracked across U.S. Route 45, heavily damaging several banks, businesses, a hospital, and several doctors offices. The tornado then moved through the northern part of Jackson, inflicting significant damage to many subdivisions and businesses. The Chapel Creek, Indian Hills, and Wyndhurst subdivisions were all struck by the tornado. Numerous homes were damaged in this area, some of which sustained loss of roofs and exterior walls. Additional damage was noted at Northside High School, at the Jackson Oaks Senior Living Complex, and in the Walnut Trace subdivision as well. Continuing northeast, the tornado caused major damage to multiple additional homes as it crossed near the intersection of Christmasville Road and Ashport Road. The Madison County Fire Station #11 was destroyed in this area as well, with the station's fire engine and pumper, along with its water and brush trucks all being damaged. Beyond this point, the tornado weakened and dissipated. 70 structures were destroyed in Jackson, with over 500 more damaged. Despite causing EF4 damage after dark in a densely populated area, the tornado did not cause any deaths in Jackson, though 51 people were injured, and the initial EF3 tornado caused three fatalities and 14 injuries. The second of the two tornadoes was the third violent tornado to hit Jackson in 10 years. Two others, both rated F4, had devastated the community on January 17, 1999 and May 4, 2003.|$|E

25|$|Ulla {{taught that}} the Rabbis ruled {{the skin of}} dead people contaminating so as to prevent people from {{fashioning}} their parents' skin into keepsakes. Similarly, the Mishnah taught that the Sadducees mocked the Pharisees, because the Pharisees taught that the Holy Scrolls rendered unclean the hands <b>that</b> <b>touched</b> them, but the books of Homer did not. In response, Rabban Johanan ben Zakkai noted that both the Pharisees and the Sadducees taught that a donkey's bones were clean, yet the bones of Johanan the High Priest were unclean. The Sadducees replied to Rabban Johanan that the uncleanness of human bones flowed from the love for them, so that people should not make keepsakes out of their parents' bones. Rabban Johanan replied that {{the same was true}} of the Holy Scriptures, for their uncleanness flowed from the love for them. Homer's books, which were not as precious, thus did not render unclean the hands <b>that</b> <b>touched</b> them.|$|E
