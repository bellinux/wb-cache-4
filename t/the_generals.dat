5|$|As {{a result}} of the tension in late-December, the {{standoff}} remained. The US hoped <b>the</b> <b>generals</b> would relent because they could not survive and be able to repel the communists or rival officers without aid from Washington. On the other hand, Khánh and the Young Turks expected the Americans would become more worried about the communist gains first and acquiesce to their fait accompli against the HNC. <b>The</b> <b>generals</b> were correct.|$|E
5|$|By mid-October, Diệm and Nhu knew of {{the coup}} plans, but {{did not know that}} Đính was firmly among them, {{although}} they were wary of him. Nhu then decided to outwit <b>the</b> <b>generals</b> with a counter-plot. <b>The</b> <b>generals</b> heard of this and decided to counteract him. The other generals were still suspicious of Đính, fearing he would betray them. Having discovered that Nhu was trying to use him to trap them, and not sure which side he was really on, they promised to make him interior minister and offered other rewards if he helped to overthrow the Ngô brothers.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, the treason and {{defection}} of Dumouriez {{gave the}} Jacobins full scope {{to take control}} of the armies. Before Neerwinden, the army obeyed its commanders. Afterward, the representatives on mission were given extraordinary powers over army commanders. <b>The</b> <b>generals</b> might pay with their lives for defeat, but the real authority lay with the political operatives. Meanwhile, the new War Minister sent his agents to spy on <b>the</b> <b>generals.</b> These men were quick to report any complaint against officers, which could result in disgrace or execution. Elements of this system stayed in force even after Maximilien Robespierre was overthrown and guillotined.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} news of this public tragedy reached Athens, a massive {{controversy}} erupted over the apportionment of blame for the botched rescue. The public was furious {{over the loss of}} so many sailors, and over the failure to recover the bodies of the dead for burial, and <b>the</b> <b>generals</b> suspected that Thrasybulus and Theramenes, who had already returned to Athens, might have been responsible for stirring up the assembly against them, and wrote letters to the people denouncing the two trierarchs as responsible for the failed rescue. Thrasybulus and Theramenes were called before the assembly to defend their behavior; in their defense, Theramenes produced a letter from <b>the</b> <b>generals</b> in which they blamed only the storm for the mishap; the trierarchs were exonerated, and public anger now turned against <b>the</b> <b>generals.</b> All eight were deposed from office, and summoned back to Athens to stand trial. Two fled, but six returned as commanded to face the charges against them.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of the coup, the rebels forced Tung to order his men to surrender. This meant that only the Presidential Guard was left to defend Gia Long Palace. At 16:45, Tung was forced at gunpoint to talk to Diệm on the phone, telling the {{president}} that he had told his men to surrender. Minh ordered Nhung to execute the Diệm loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy, since the special forces commander had disguised his men in army uniforms and framed <b>the</b> <b>generals</b> for the pagoda raids. <b>The</b> <b>generals</b> were aware of the threat Tung posed; they had discussed his elimination during their planning, having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces.|$|E
5|$|In the historiography of this battle, {{the figures}} would be {{deliberately}} inflated or underplayed by <b>the</b> <b>generals</b> {{of both sides}} attempting to lessen the impact the figures would have on public opinion both during aftermath of the battle or, for political reasons, later during the Soviet period.|$|E

5|$|Later in the day, Đôn privately {{met with}} CIA agent Lucien Conein and reiterated that the Americans were mistaken in {{believing that the}} ARVN was responsible. Đôn insisted that Diem {{remained}} in control although Nhu had to approve all of the generals' meetings with Diệm. Đôn insisted Nhu had orchestrated the raids, fearing that <b>the</b> <b>generals</b> had too much power. He asserted that Nhu used the cover of martial law to discredit <b>the</b> <b>generals</b> by dressing the Special Forces in ARVN uniforms. Đôn insisted that {{he was unaware of}} the plans and was at Joint General Staff headquarters with Khiêm when he received a radio message informing him of the assaults. Police Commissioner Trần Văn Tu, supported by Tung's men, were in charge of the operation at ground level, and by the time Don arrived, the mission had been completed.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo, Donatello, and Michelangelo {{plan their}} next move, while Donatello discovers the next portal will open over Winters' tower. Splinter tells Leonardo {{that his team}} is incomplete, and that {{he knows what he}} must do. After 11 monsters have been captured, General Aguila {{questions}} Yaotl's actions. <b>The</b> <b>generals</b> conspire to betray Yaotl, wanting to remain immortal. Raphael encounters the Jersey Devil, one of the remaining monsters but drives it off. Leonardo fights Raphael, but when he breaks Leonardo's swords, Raphael is forced to leave. <b>The</b> <b>generals</b> seize Leonardo, intending to substitute him for the 13th missing beast, and Raphael decides to make amends by rescuing Leonardo. As the portal opens, Yaotl discovers his generals' treachery, while Splinter and the Turtles, accompanied by Casey and April, fight their way through the Foot Clan cordon and breach the tower. Yaotl reveals the truth to the heroes: he wants to be free of his curse of immortality. <b>The</b> <b>generals</b> reveal that they wish to preserve their immortality, but also to use the portal to bring in more monsters to conquer the world.|$|E

The following day, Karnan goes to war accompanied by his son Vrishasena who fights bravely, but is killed by Arjuna afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Following this, Joan {{begins to}} gather troops {{and she takes}} her army to the forests around Orleans. While they camp there, a girl named Isabel comes and begins to {{describe}} the events surrounding siege of the city. Joan sends a messenger to offer the English peace, but the English decline. The French attack the English and, {{as soon as they}} start, a storm starts up and lightning flashes about them. This scares the English and Joan is able to win and enter the city. Soon after, Joan is able to lift the siege. The story continues with various French victories and the English are pushed back from fort after fort. Eventually, the English are pushed back to Tourelles. While the English fight their way there, one of <b>the</b> <b>generals,</b> Salisbury, is able to wound Joan. Her companion, Theodore, is able to kill Salisbury in return but he is brought down by the general Talbot. The French soon lay siege to Tourelles and begin a bloody fight to take the fort.
