He also <b>taught</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> give up all evil doings and practices and do righteousness or be destroyed {{from the face of the}} earth. He taught us that the slave-masters had <b>taught</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> eat the wrong food and that this wrong food is the cause of our sickness and short span of life. He {{declared that}} he would heal us and set us in heaven at once, if we would submit to Him. Otherwise he would chastise us with a severe chastisement until we did submit. And that He was able to force the whole world into submission to his will. He said that he loved us (the so-called Negroes), his lost and found, so well that he would eat rattlesnakes to free us if necessary, for he has power over all things.|$|E

500|$|Foo Fighters earned mostly {{positive}} reviews upon release. Many critics {{compared the}} album to Grohl's previous band, Nirvana. Reviewer David Browne of Entertainment Weekly considered that [...] " [...] songs pack the riffy wallop of unpolished Nirvana demos, {{and his voice}} has Kurt Cobain's lunging, over-the-top passion." [...] Writing for Spin, Terri Sutton stylistically compared the album to Nirvana's second album, Nevermind, saying that [...] "the album's first half [...] owes much to Nevermind, and it's tempting to hear {{it in the way}} Nevermind <b>taught</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> hear." [...] Paul Rees of Kerrang! admitted that [...] "Foo Fighters cannot fail to evoke Kurt Cobain's memory, whether if through Grohl's ragged howl of a voice or the way a number of its songs go soft-soft-loud", but ultimately considered the record [...] "more than strong enough to stand or fall in its own merits". [...] Billboard complimented the [...] "inspired songwriting and passionate performances", adding the album could please grunge fans and [...] "also remind fans of other rock and punk taste makers, from Green Day and The Offspring to Better than Ezra." ...|$|E

It {{has been said}} that Tickell's poetic powers were awakened by his admiration for the person and genius of Addison, and undoubtedly his best work is the sincere and dignified elegy addressed to Addison's stepson Edward Rich, 7th Earl of Warwick on Addison's death: [...] He <b>taught</b> <b>us</b> how <b>to</b> live, and oh! too high, the price for knowledge, <b>taught</b> <b>us</b> how <b>to</b> die.|$|R

2500|$|A major {{precedent}} {{was formed}} {{on the use}} of linguistic profiling in the case of Sanchez v. People. A witness testified against a suspect based on his overhearing of an argument between two apparent Spanish speakers where the killer was identified as having a Dominican rather than a Puerto Rican accent. The New York Superior Court ruled that distinguishing between accents was permissible {{based on the fact that}} [...] "human experience has <b>taught</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> discern the variation in the mode of speech of certain individuals." [...] The court found that a certain degree of familiarity with the accents and dialects of a region or ethnic group qualified an individual to identify ethnicity or race in a court based on auditory evidence.|$|E
2500|$|In Gratz v. Bollinger, Thomas said that, in his view, [...] "a State's use {{of racial}} {{discrimination}} in higher education admissions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause." [...] In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, Thomas joined the opinion of Chief Justice Roberts, who concluded that [...] "he way to stop {{discrimination on the basis}} of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race." [...] Concurring, Thomas wrote that [...] "if our history has taught us anything, it has <b>taught</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> beware of elites bearing racial theories," [...] and charged that the dissent carried [...] "similarities" [...] to the arguments of the segregationist litigants in Brown v. Board of Education. In Grutter v. Bollinger, he approvingly quoted Justice Harlan's Plessy v. Ferguson dissent: [...] "Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens." [...] In a concurrence in Missouri v. Jenkins (1995), he wrote that the Missouri District Court [...] "has read our cases to support the theory that black students suffer an unspecified psychological harm from segregation that retards their mental and educational development. This approach not only relies upon questionable social science research rather than constitutional principle, but it also rests on an assumption of black inferiority." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{concurrence}} {{with the}} majority opinion Justice Clarence Thomas restated his view, in agreement with Justice Harlan's dissent in Plessy, that the Constitution is [...] "color-blind." [...] For Thomas, this means that no {{discrimination on the basis}} of race is permitted by the Constitution, even for a so-called [...] "benign" [...] purpose (Thomas rejected the notion that there could be a purely benign purpose in his concurrence in Adarand because the benignity or malignity of race-based discrimination turns on [...] "whose ox is being gored" [...] or is [...] "in the eye of the beholder"). [...] Justice Thomas also rejected the view advanced by the dissent that these school districts were in danger of resegregation. [...] He contended that whatever trends toward classroom racial imbalance have obtained, they were not the result of state-sanctioned segregation as in the pre-Brown era. Justice Thomas goes on to call out the dissent for adopting segregationist reasoning advanced in Brown, particularly its insistence that the Court should defer to local school board knowledge, expertise, and judgment. [...] He also wrote about the unsettled debate concerning whether racial balance or diversity has a positive effect on educational outcomes. [...] Justice Thomas recoils at the suggestion that black students can only learn if they are sitting next to white students. [...] Some of the concurrence consists of social science citations and statistics showing that black students can succeed in majority black schools such as HBCUs. [...] Justice Thomas concludes noting [...] "If our history has taught us anything it has <b>taught</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> beware of elites bearing racial theories." [...] In a footnote the Justice added a personal mention of Justice Breyer: [...] "Justice Breyer's good intentions, which I do not doubt, have the shelf life of Justice Breyer's tenure." [...] He goes on to explain that he is skeptical that school boards will always have such good intentions in their race-based decisionmaking, for, as Madison said, [...] "if men were angels, no government would be necessary." ...|$|E
