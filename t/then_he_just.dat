500|$|In casting his nine-member crew, Whedon looked {{first at}} the actors and {{considered}} their chemistry with others. Cast member Sean Maher recalls, [...] "So <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> sort of put us all together, and I {{think it was very}} quick, like right out of the gate, we all instantly bonded". All nine cast members were chosen before filming began. However, while filming the original pilot [...] "Serenity", Whedon decided that Rebecca Gayheart was unsuitable for the role of Inara Serra, and shot her scenes in singles so that {{it would be easier to}} replace her. Morena Baccarin auditioned for the role and two days later was on the set in her first television show. [...] "Joss brought me down from the testing room like a proud dad, holding my hand and introducing me," [...] Baccarin recalled.|$|E
500|$|Kasey Kahne, who {{finished}} second, said, [...] "I hung {{with him for}} about three laps running in his kind of dirty air. I was right there. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> slowly crept away. It felt good. We were close. That’s a huge improvement. I was pretty happy." [...] "We had a similar [...] issue {{at the start of}} the Pocono race last year where we broke a fuel cable," [...] Hamlin said after the race. [...] "I thought maybe that’s what we did. When I went to take off , it immediately shut off. While it was [...] "a downer, I was pretty confident we weren’t going to have it again. Because Mike [...] never really gave me an alarm we were going to be stretching it on fuel." [...] In the subsequent press conference, Hamlin's crew chief said, ...|$|E
500|$|Kinsler {{narrowly}} missed {{making the}} AL All-Star team. First, {{though he had}} led all AL second basemen as of June 30, with 2,170,100 fan votes (fifth-most votes of all AL players, just ahead of Dustin Pedroia's 2,163,270), Pedroia passed him {{on the last day}} in last-minute voting. <b>Then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> missed making the team as a reserve in player voting, coming in second again, this time to Toronto's Aaron Hill. He missed in his third chance, as AL All Star team and Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon did not pick him as a reserve. He missed a fourth opportunity to make the team, in the Sprint Final Vote competition for the final spot on the team, coming in second to Brandon Inge of the Tigers. A fifth opportunity presented itself when Pedroia pulled out of the All Star Game to spend time with his pregnant wife—and as Kinsler had finished second in fan voting, in player voting, and in the Final Vote competition, he appeared a likely candidate to replace his fellow second baseman. But Maddon went with one of his own to replace Pedroia, Tampa Bay's first baseman Carlos Peña, who was leading the league in homers but batting [...]228 (and who had come in fourth in the Final Vote competition, behind Kinsler and Chone Figgins). A sixth and final opportunity presented itself when Evan Longoria withdrew because of a finger infection; but again Maddon (a former Angels coach) chose someone else as a replacement, this time Figgins of the Angels, who had come in third in the Final Vote competition (behind Kinsler).|$|E

2500|$|Facing forward, Moore {{could not}} see Sanchez miss the handoff, but he recalls that [...] "You could feel it, you knew {{something}} wasn't right." [...] When the fumble occurred, Moore was not aware that his buttocks had caused it; he learned of his role only after the game. When asked about the play, Moore answered, [...] "Why do I {{need to talk about}} that? I don't understand why y’all keep asking about that play. ... I think it was a miscue with the handoff." [...] After consulting Sanchez and his assistant coaches, Jets head coach Rex Ryan echoed the analysis: [...] "My understanding is, I thought [...] reversed out the wrong way. That's what happened. It was a mental mistake and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> tried to slide. When he did, he actually ran into Brandon." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{that same}} Raw Is War at the First Union Center in Philadelphia, The Rock {{returned}} {{for the first}} time since his kayfabe suspension (in reality, he was given the [...] "suspension" [...] to film The Scorpion King) on the April 2 episode of Raw Is War. Shane, Stephanie, and Vince McMahon were in the ring that night, trying to convince The Rock to join them. Shane reminded The Rock of how Vince screwed him out of the WWF Championship earlier that year at WrestleMania and also in a steel cage match the day after WrestleMania. Vince conceded that it was wrong for him to back Austin, as he was a rattlesnake that he should have known would eventually bite him. He promised The Rock that he had no intention of screwing him if he returned to the WWF but also noted that he could not promise that he never would; if it was good for business, he said, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> might do it. He told The Rock that he was at least being honest with him and pleaded for The Rock to trust himself, stating that his future was with the fans and the WWF. The Rock gave Vince a Rock Bottom after some bickering between Shane and Vince, and proceeded to stare down Shane, then smile cheekily and shake Shane's hand, faking a defection to the Alliance and a heel turn – but he then proceeded to Rock Bottom him as well and give him a People's Elbow, before emphatically asserting, [...] "Finally, the Rock has come back... to the WWF," [...] thus aligning himself with the World Wrestling Federation.|$|E

50|$|This was a post {{rather than}} a rank in itself, and if its holder's {{permanent}} rank was below that of an admiral <b>then</b> <b>he</b> ranked <b>just</b> below the most junior rear-admiral and was entitled to the pay and allowance of a rear-admiral whilst he held the post.|$|R

6000|$|... "Indeed <b>then,</b> doctor, <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> bad enough," [...] {{said her}} ladyship, {{not in a}} very happy tone of voice; [...] "just bad enough. There's been some'at {{at the back of}} his head, rapping, and rapping, and rapping; and if you don't do something, I'm {{thinking}} it will rap him too hard yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} such pluck in a mite like that," [...] he whispered {{afterwards}} to his anxious auditory. [...] "He never dropped those ribbons, by G--, until I got alongside, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> hopped down and said, as short and cool as you please, 'Dank you!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fancy your spunk!" [...] said Mary admiringly. [...] "I wouldn't {{have dared}} {{do that and}} I'm not so slow. Mrs. Wilson says {{the two of you}} jawed {{something}} scandalous, but you come off best and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> turned round and like to eat you up.

6000|$|He {{waited a}} little, {{but the door}} {{remained}} shut as tightly as before. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> put his shoulder to it, and immediately the wood began to crack.

5000|$|During an awards {{ceremony}} in Beijing in April 2011, Jackie {{stated that he}} would be donating half his money to charity when he dies, instead of to his son.

6000|$|Warner's been in here {{swearing}} like a lunatic, {{and saying}} he had written you {{to come on the}} 4th,--and I said, [...] "You leather-head, if I talk in Boston both afternoon and evening March 5, I'll have to go to Boston the 4th,"--and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> kicked up his heels and went off cursing after a fashion I never heard of before.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> {{stroked the}} skein with his wand, {{and all the}} broken threads joined {{themselves}} together, and the whole skein wound itself smoothly off in the most surprising manner, and the Prince, turning to Graciosa, {{asked if there was}} nothing else that she wished him to do for her, and if the time would never come when she would wish for him for his own sake.|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I--I'd like {{to taste}} one more nut before I starve to death," [...] muttered Chatterer, and almost without knowing it, {{he began to}} gnaw the hard shell. When that nut was finished, he found another; and when that was gone, still another. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> had to taste a grain of corn. The first thing Chatterer knew, the nuts and the corn were all gone, and his stomach was full. Somehow he felt ever so much better. He didn't feel like {{starving}} to death now.|$|E
2500|$|Superintendent Faidley {{said the}} school offered Doe [...] "reasonable and appropriate" [...] {{alternatives}} to changing clothes {{in front of the}} transgender student.

60|$|When Sammy Jay, who was {{listening}} and chuckling as he listened, heard that, he flew down {{where he would}} be just out of reach of Old Man Coyote, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> turned that tongue of his loose, and you know that some people say that Sammy's tongue is hung in the middle and wags at both ends. Of course this isn't really so, but when he gets to abusing people it seems as if it must be true. He called Old Man Coyote every bad name he could think of. He called him a sneak, a thief, a coward, a bully, {{and a lot of other}} things.|$|E
60|$|And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> {{broke down}} and cried, he was so thankful. So between him and Tom there was talk enough, Jim being excited because the land {{was so full of}} history--Joseph and his brethren, Moses in the bulrushers, Jacob coming down into Egypt to buy corn, the silver cup in the sack, and all them {{interesting}} things; and Tom just as excited too, because the land was so full of history that was in HIS line, about Noureddin, and Bedreddin, and such like monstrous giants, that made Jim's wool rise, and a raft of other Arabian Nights folks, which the half of them never done the things they let on they done, I don't believe.|$|E
5000|$|Critics {{have since}} called Hathaway's debut his finest album. Joel Dorn {{wrote that the}} album was the artist's best and that it had, [...] "a certain innocence to it.

He saw Shadow dodge in the very nick of time. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> watched Whitey swoop again and again as Shadow dodged {{this way and that}} way.

6000|$|... "It was Mr. Scott who did it," [...] {{said the}} Story Girl. [...] "He was preaching somewhere in Nova Scotia, {{and when he}} was more than half way through his sermon--and you know sermons were VERY long in those days--a man walked in. Mr. Scott stopped until he had taken his seat. Then he said, 'My friend, you are very late for this service. I hope you won't be late for heaven. The {{congregation}} will excuse me if I recapitulate the sermon for our friend's benefit.' And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> preached the sermon over again from the beginning. It is said that that particular man was never known to be late for church again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's been {{my friend}} so long," [...] she said sorrowfully to Anne. [...] "He was Dick's old dog, you know--Dick had {{him for a}} year or so before we were married. He left him with me when he sailed on the Four Sisters. Carlo got very fond of me--and his dog-love helped me through that first dreadful year after mother died, when I was alone. When I heard that Dick was coming back I was afraid Carlo wouldn't be so much mine. But he never seemed to care for Dick, though he had been so fond of him once. He would snap and growl {{at him as if he}} were a stranger. I was glad. It was nice to have one thing whose love was all mine. That old dog has been such a comfort to me, Anne. He got so feeble in the fall that I was afraid he couldn't live long--but I hoped I could nurse him through the winter. He seemed pretty well this morning. He was lying on the rug before the fire; then, all at once, he got up and crept over to me; he put his head on my lap and gave me one loving look out of his big, soft, dog eyes--and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> shivered and died. I shall miss him so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{he cocked}} his head down and took another look; he glances up {{perfectly}} joyful, this time; winks his wings and his tail both, and says, 'Oh, no, this ain't no fat thing, I reckon! If I ain't in luck! --Why it's a perfectly elegant hole!' So he flew down and got that acorn, and fetched it up and dropped it in, and was just tilting his head back, with the heavenliest smile on his face, {{when all of a sudden}} he was paralyzed into a listening attitude and that smile faded gradually out of his countenance like breath off'n a razor, and the queerest look of surprise took its place. Then he says, 'Why, I didn't hear it fall!' He cocked his eye at the hole again, and took a long look; raised up and shook his head; stepped around to the other side of the hole and took another look from that side; shook his head again. He studied a while, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> went into the Details--walked round and round the hole and spied into it from every point of the compass. No use. Now he took a thinking attitude on the comb of the roof and scratched the back of his head with his right foot a minute, and finally says, 'Well, it's too many for ME, that's certain; must be a mighty long hole; however, I ain't got no time to fool around here, I got to [...] "tend to business"; I reckon it's all right--chance it, anyway.' ...|$|E
