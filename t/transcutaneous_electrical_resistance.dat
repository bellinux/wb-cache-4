40|$|AbstractEvaluation of {{the skin}} irritancy and {{corrosivity}} potential of an ingredient is a necessity in the safety assessment of cosmetic ingredients. To date, there are two formally validated alternatives to the rabbit Draize test for skin corrosivity in place, namely the rat skin <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>resistance</b> (TER) assay and the Human Skin Model Test using EpiSkin™, EpiDerm™ and SkinEthic™ reconstructed human epidermal equivalents. For skin irritation, EpiSkin™, EpiDerm™ and SkinEthic™ are validated as stand-alone test replacements for the rabbit Draize test. Data from these tests are rarely considered in isolation and are evaluated {{in combination with other}} factors to establish the overall irritating or corrosive potential of an ingredient. In light of the deadlines established in the Cosmetics Directive for cessation of animal testing for cosmetic ingredients, a COLIPA scientific meeting was held in Brussels on 30 th January, 2008 to review the use of alternative approaches and to set up a decision tree approach for their integration into tiered testing strategies for hazard and safety assessment of cosmetic ingredients and their use in products. In conclusion, the safety assessments for skin irritation/corrosion of new chemicals for use in cosmetics can be confidently accomplished using exclusively alternative methods...|$|E
40|$|As a {{follow-up}} to a prevalidation study on IN VITRO tests for replacing the IN VIVO rabbit test for skin corrosivity, an international validation study was conducted during 1996 and 1997 {{under the auspices of}} ECVAM. The tests evaluated were the rat skin <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>resistance</b> (TER) assay, CORROSITEX TM, the Skin 2 TM ZK 1350 corrosivity test and EPISKIN TM. Each test was conducted in three independent laboratories. Sixty coded chemicals were tested. Two of the four test evaluated, the TER assay and EPISKIN, met the criteria agreed by the Management Team concerning acceptable underprediction and overprediction rates for them to be considered scientifically validated for use as replacements for the animal test for distinguishing between corrosive and non-corrosive chemicals for all of the chemical types studied. EPSKIN was the only test able to distinguish between known R 35 (UN packing group I) and R 34 (UN packing groups II & III) chemicals, for all of the chemical types included, on an acceptable number of occasions. The corrosive potentials of about 40 % of the test chemicals could not be assessed with CORROSITEX; however, it may be valid for testing specific classes of chemicals. The Skin 2 assay did not meet the criteria for it to be considered scientifically validated. JRC. (EI) -Environment Institut...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} whether <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation or interferential current {{was more effective}} in reducing experimentally heat pain. Forty-eight young healthy subjects were randomly divided into the following groups: (i) <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation; (ii) interferential current; and (iii) no stimulation. A multi-function electrical stimulator was used to generate the <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation or interferential current. A thermal sensory analyser was used to record the heat pain threshold. The stimulation lasted for 30 minutes and the heat pain thresholds were measured before, {{during and after the}} stimulation. <b>Transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation (p= 0. 003) and interferential current (p= 0. 004) significantly elevated the heat pain threshold, but "no stimulation" did not. The thresholds of the <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation and interferential current groups were significantly higher than that of the control group 30 minutes into the stimulation (p = 0. 017). Both <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation and interferential current increased the heat pain threshold to a similar extent during stimulation. However, the post-stimulation effect of interferential current lasted longer than that of <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: This {{feasibility}} study aimed to (i) develop a clinical protocol using a long-term potentiation-like repetitive stimulation protocol for <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation {{in patients with}} upper limb complex regional pain syndrome and (ii) develop a research protocol for a single-blind randomised controlled trial investigating the efficacy of <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation for complex regional pain syndrome. Methods: This small-scale single-blind feasibility randomised-controlled trial planned to randomise 30 patients with upper limb complex regional pain syndrome to either a variant of <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation or placebo <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation for three weeks. Stimulation comprised 20 pulses over 1 s with a non- stimulation interval of 5 s, a so-called repetitive electrical stimulation protocol following the timing of long-term potenti- ation. Pain, function and body image were measured at baseline, post-treatment and at three months follow-up. At three months, participants were invited to one-to-one interviews, which were analysed thematically. Results: A <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation protocol with electrodes applied proximal {{to the area of}} allodynia in the region of the upper arm was developed. Participant concordance with the protocol was high. Recruitment was below target (<b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation (n ¼ 6), placebo (n ¼ 2)). Mean (SD) pain intensity for the <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation group on a 0 to 10 scale was 7. 2 (2. 4), 6. 6 (2. 8) and 7. 8 (1. 9), at baseline, post-treatment and at three-month follow-up, respectively. Qualitative data suggested that some patients found <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation beneficial, easy to use and were still using it at three months. Conclusion: Patients tolerated <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation well, and important methodological infor- mation to facilitate the design of a large-scale trial was obtained (ISRCTN 48768534) ...|$|R
40|$|Untoward {{reactions}} to cosmetics, toiletries, and topical applications are the commonest single reason for hospital referrals with allergic contact dermatitis. In most cases, {{these are only}} mild or transient and most reactions being irritant rather than allergic in nature. Various adverse effects may occur {{in the form of}} acute toxicity, percutaneous absorption, skin irritation, eye irritation, skin sensitization and photosensitization, subchronic toxicity, mutagenicity/genotoxicity, and phototoxicity/photoirritation. The safety assessment of a cosmetic product clearly depends upon how it is used, since it determines the amount of substance which may be ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin or mucous membranes. Concentration of ingredients used in the different products is also important. Various test procedures include in vivo animal models and in vitro models, such as open or closed patch test, in vivo skin irritation test, skin corrosivity potential tests (rat skin <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>resistance</b> test, Episkin test), eye irritation tests (in vivo eye irritancy test and Draize eye irritancy test), mutagenicity/genotoxicity tests (in vitro bacterial reverse mutation test and in vitro mammalian cell chromosome aberration test), and phototoxicity/photoirritation test (3 T 3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity test).

40|$|The {{influence}} of naloxone {{on the effects}} of high frequency <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation in angina pectoris induced by atrial pacing was studied in 11 patients with severe coronary artery disease. The patients were catheterised and treated with <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation on two occasions, double blind and in random order, with a single intravenous dose of saline or with a single intravenous dose of 50 mg naloxone. Treatment with <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation increased tolerance to pacing and significantly improved lactate metabolism with placebo and with naloxone. The positive effects of <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation were thus reproducible and not reversed by single intravenous doses of naloxone. The results indicate that the effects of <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation on the heart are not mediated by beta endorphin but they do not exclude activation of more short-acting opioids such as delta or kappa receptor agonists (met-enkephalin or dynorphin or both) because naloxone has a low affinity for these receptors.

40|$|Objective: This is {{a double}} blind study that {{examined}} the optimal stimulation frequency of <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation in reducing pain due to knee osteoarthritis. Subjects: Thirty-four subjects were randomly allocated into 4 groups receiving <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation at either: (i) 2 Hz; (ii) 100 Hz; (iii) an alternating frequency of 2 Hz and 100 Hz (2 / 100 Hz); or (iv) a placebo <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation. Methods: Treatment was administered 5 {{days a week for}} 2 weeks. The outcome measures included: (i) a visual analogue scale; (ii) a timed up-and-go test; and (iii) a range of knee motion. Results: The 3 active <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation groups (2 Hz, 100 Hz, 2 / 100 Hz), but not the placebo group, significantly reduced osteoarthritic knee pain across treatment sessions. However, no significant between-group difference was found. Similarly, the 3 active <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation groups, but not the placebo group, produced significant reductions in the amount of time required to perform the timed up-and-go test, and an increase in the maximum passive knee range of motion. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that 2 weeks of repeated applications of <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> nerve stimulation at 2 Hz, 100 Hz or 2 / 100 Hz produced similar treatment effects for people suffering from osteoarthritic knee.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> stimulation, {{when applied to}} acupuncture points in patients after acute stroke, decreases spasticity and/or increases muscle strength more effectively than placebo stimulation and standard rehabilitation. DESIGN: Randomized control trial. SUBJECTS: Sixty-two patients aged 70. 0 (standard deviation 7. 4) years and 9. 2 (standard deviation 3. 4) days post-stroke. METHODS: The patients {{were randomly assigned to}} 3 groups receiving <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> stimulation, placebo stimulation, or standard rehabilitation alone. Stimulation was applied to 4 acupuncture points in the affected lower leg for 60 min, 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Plantarflexor spasticity, ankle muscle strength, and functional mobility were measured before treatment, weekly during treatment, and at follow-up at week 8 post-stroke. RESULTS: No significant difference was found in the outcome measures among groups before treatment. When compared with standard rehabilitation or placebo stimulation, <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> stimulation to acupuncture points significantly increased the percentage of patients with normal tone, increased ankle dorsiflexor strength, and decreased antagonist co-contraction ratio (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). The patients in the <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> stimulation group also tended to walk 2 – 4 days earlier than the patients in the other 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Three weeks of <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> stimulation to lower leg acupuncture points, given 5 times a week within 10 days post-stroke, significantly decreased ankle plantarflexor spasticity, and increased dorsiflexor strength concomitant with a decrease in antagonist co-contraction.
