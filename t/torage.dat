However, {{over the past several}} decades, the storage primitives that access secondary storage have remained unchanged, forcing NAND flash memory to serve merely as a block device like hard disk drive. Recently, several emerging storage primitives have been presented to explore the potential value of non-volatile memory devices. Although these primitives can significantly boost the access performance by providing virtual to logical address mappings, they still suffer from large RAM footprint to maintain the address mapping table and require further support for update operations.

Within the Roer Valley Graben area Triassic Buntsandstein rocks have an {{estimated}} CO 2 storage capacity of several hundred million tons. Mesozoic shales and younger sediments provide adequate sealing. Westphalian D sandstones may possess storage opportunities in the southern graben area, and the karstified/dolomitized parts of the Dinantian carbonates in the western sub-basin have an estimated CO 2 storage capacity of 130 X 106 tons. Inplaces, the Dinantian reservoirs may be combined with carbonate r servoirs inthe underlying Devonian str ta. Sealing is provided by Namurian shales and Westphalian coals and shales. Along the western and southern edge of the basin the Dinantian reser-voir is sealed by Cretaceous chalks and marls. Besides aquifers, the available coal qualifies for CO 2 storage. Six coalbed methane target eas contain a producible enhanced coalbed methane (ECBM), volume of 53 - 79 X 109 m 3. This provides a minimum CO 2 sequestration potential of 400 • 106 tons.

40|$|Modern {{multi-layer}} insulation (MLI) allows to sharply {{reduce the heat}} leak into cryogenic propellant storage tanks through the tank surface and, as a consequence, significantly extend the storage duration. In this situation the MLI penetrations, such as support struts, feed lines, etc., {{become one of the}} most significant challenges of the tanks heat management. This problem is especially acute for liquid hydrogen (LH 2) storage, since currently no efficient cryocoolers exist that operate at very low LH 2 temperatures (20 K). Even small heat leaks under microgravity conditions and over the period of many months give rise to a complex slowly-developing, large-scale spatiotemporal physical phenomena in a multi-phase liquid-vapor mixture. These phenomena are not well-understood nor can be easily controlled. They can be of a potentially hazardous nature for long-term on-orbital cryogenic <b>torage,</b> propellant loading, tank chilldown, engine restart, and other in-space cryogenic fluid management operations. To support the engineering design solutions that would mitigate these effects a detailed physics-based analysis of heat transfer, vapor bubble formation, growth, motion, coalescence and collapse is required in the presence of stirring jets of different configurations and passive cooling devices such as MLI, thermodynamic vent system, and vapor-cooled shield. To develop physics-based models and correlations reliable for microgravity conditions and long-time scales there is a need for new fundamental data to be collected from on-orbit cryogenic storage experiments.

LoT technologies are expanding rapidly {{in the recent years}} and they are applied {{in a wide range of}} applications ranging from domestic appliances and buildings to indus trial installations and farmer fields. The existing wireless telecommunication networks that are of widespread deployment have neither been designed to serve regions located far from stations, bases and infrastructure nor for the transfer of low volume da ta, hence resulting in appliances consuming large amounts of energy. The above - mentioned factors are significant with respect to the Lot appliances. The so called “ Low Power Wide Area Network ” provides for a solution in tackling the aforementioned issues. This is a technology ensuring the interface of appliances by basically prioritizing both the economy (low power consumption mode) and a broad coverage. Many companies have developed in recent years their own LPWAN technology such as Sigfox, LoRa Alliance, Igenu and Weightless, to mention but a few. LoRa (LoRa Alliance, [URL] :// LoRa - alliance. org) is one of LPWAN protocols and is the subject matter of thisessay. The broad range and the economy of the nodes of the network make this technology ideal for the u rban, industrial and rural related infrastructure appliances.

40|$|Single-phase, utility interfaced, {{isolated}} AC-DC converters {{with power}} f actor correction cover {{a wide range}} of applications such as chargers for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles, inverte rs for multiple renewable energy sources (e. g. photovoltaic modules), as well as interfaces for residential DC distribution systems and energy s <b>torage</b> systems. Thereby, bidirectional conversion capability enables the development of smart interactive power networks in which the energy sys tems play an active role in providing different types of support to the grid. Examples are vehicle-to-grid concepts, smart home concepts, AC m icrogrids, and residential DC distribution systems (DC nanogrids). In the presented work, the main objective is to investigate the feasibility and suitability of a single-stage (1 -S) dual active bridge (DAB) AC-DC converter for the realization of the above mentioned bidirect ional energy conversions. Compared to the commonly used dual-stage (2 -S) systems, the 1 -S architecture has the potential to benefit the system p erformance with regard to efficiency, volume (power density), number of components (reliability), weight, and costs, due to the effective omissi on of a complete energy conversion stage. In order to validate the prese nted analyses, a second objective is to realize a state-of-the-art (i. e. regarding efficiency and power density) converter prototype system that is designed {{in order to meet the}} requirements for future, mode 1 compat ible, on-board electric vehicle battery chargers, interfacing a 400 V DC -bus with the single-phase 230 VAC / 50 Hz mains. Compliance with domest ic power sockets results in a nominal (active) AC charging current of 16 Arms and a nominal power of 3. 7 kW. The main challenge to achieve the above objectives lies in addressing the fundamental limitati ons of the existing analyses and circuit implementations of DAB converte rs. These limitations mainly relate to the soft-switching (i. e. by virtu e of zero voltage switching, ZVS) modulation schemes available in litera ture, being especially problematic for DAB converters with large input a nd/or output voltage variations and large power variations, such as is t he case for the 1 -S DAB AC-DC architecture at hand. By means of an intro ductory Chapter (i. e. Chapter 2), the shortcomings in the existing analy ses of DAB converters are highlighted, and the selection of the full bri dge - full bridge (FBFB) DAB implementation as the most suitable candida te for the considered AC-DC converter topology is motivated. The subsequ ent chapters discuss the 1 -S DAB AC-DC converter in detail: Chapter 3 outlines the operating principle of the DAB AC-DC converter. T he exact operating range of the DAB DC-DC converter, as the main buildin g block of the 1 -S AC-DC architecture, is derived, and a control equatio n for the DAB input current is obtained. Furthermore, the steady-state a nalysis of the DAB is presented and commutation inductance(s)  are intr oduced as an essential HF AC-link modification in order to achieve full- operating-range ZVS. Lastly, a novel current-dependent charge-based (C DCB) ZVS verification method is proposed in order to deal with the defic iencies of the existing current-based (CB) and energy-based (EB) ZVS ana lyses; Chapter 4 is devoted to the derivation of full-operating-range ZVS modul ation schemes for the DAB converter. Three different approaches are pres ented, being a numerical approach, an analytical approach, and a semi-an alytical approach, all relying on the CDCB ZVS verification method propo sed in Chapter 3 in order to assure that soft-switching operation with q uasi zero switching losses is obtained within the calculated ZVS regions; In Chapter 5, the main functional elements of the DAB AC-DC prototype co nverter are designed, employing the values for the circuit level variabl es and the ZVS modulation schemes derived in Chapter 4. State-of-the-art design methods/procedures, models for the component losses, and volume models are combined with custom developed (local) optimization algorithm s in order to obtain a high-efficiency and high-power-density converter design that is in compliance with the specified system requirements; In Chapter 6, first a DC-DC system characterization of the prototype sys tem is presented in order to validate the theoretical analyses, i. e. the steady-state converter model and the ZVS analysis outlined in Chapter 3, as well as the CDCB ZVS modulation schemes proposed in Chapter 4. Ther eafter, the results of an AC-DC system characterization are given, allow ing to evaluate the performance of the prototype converter with regard t o the reached efficiency and with regard to the quality of the AC input power. Conversion efficiencies higher than 95 % within the major pa rt of the output power range, with a very flat efficiency curve and thus a high partial-load efficiency, are reported. The peak efficiency is ar ound 96 % and the efficiency at nominal power approximately 95. 6 %. Moreover, a high power density of 2 kW/liter is obtained. From a b rief comparison with several (similar) dual-stage prototype systems foun d in literature, it is clear that the achieved performance is close to t he absolute state-of-the-art; Chapter 7 concludes the presented work and provides an outlook regarding future research in the field of DAB AC-DC converters. nrpages: 332 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Now {{that the}} dust has settled, it 2 ̆ 7 s {{clear that the}} federal budget {{delivered}} less than appeared on the renewable energy front, writes Tony Kevin IN THE 2010 Budget documents and associated media releases by Energy Minister Martin Ferguson (eight, under the rubric “Australia’s biggest ever renewable energy rollout”), the government sought to create an impression of active support for Australian scientific and engineering research efforts in renewable energy fields (solar, wind, geothermal, biofuels). Yet in terms of new money, it was still small beer. In the trumpeted 5. 1 billion “Expanded Renewable Energy Future Fund,” 650 million was new money and the remaining 4. 5 billion simply recycled unspent pledges from previous budgets. Those old budget pledges for renewable energy are still being doled out at a snail’s pace, {{with the emphasis on}} spreading the (thin) gravy as widely as possible around Australian industry and universities, rather than on achieving fast greenhouse gas emissions cuts.   The selection of one 1000 MW solar flagship power station, the centrepiece of the renewable energy section of the 2009 budget, now seems a year behind schedule. The 2010 budget papers say that the two final successful flagships applicants – one solar, and one coal carbon capture and <b>torage</b> – will be announced {{in the first half of}} 2011. Yet the 2009 budget papers had indicated that these selections would be made in the first half of 2010. Meanwhile, four short-listed solar photovoltaic and four solar thermal company projects (totalling 1425 MW, all in the low range of 150 - 250 MW each, and spread over all states except WA and Tasmania), will share 15 million in feasibility funding.   Separately, there is 92 million for two “large-scale” (actually, quite small – 23 and 40 MW) solar energy demonstration projects in Queensland and SA. There is another 20 million-odd to be spread around five research projects in advanced solar energy technologies. As in Joseph Heller’s Catch- 22, everyone will get a share. But this is peanut money, which won’t begin to spend the proclaimed 5. 1 billion Expanded Renewable Energy Future Fund program any time soon. It’s still all experimental, prototype activity. The emphasis is still on research, rather than on seriously building megawatt-scale renewable energy generating capacity. And this, of course, is where the coal industry is happy for renewable energy to remain for as long as possible. The proposed 1000 MW solar flagship power station still seems quite a few years away. There is no sense of urgency – rather, of dribbling a few million dollars around the country, to keep the renewable energy lobbies happy or at least fairly quiet. It is still climate change policy a la Rudd: clever, interest group politics. For all Wayne Swan’s good words on “Investing in Renewable Energy” in his Budget Speech, there is still no evidence of a national decarbonisation strategic vision, no appreciation of the real urgency of the decarbonisation task before the nation, if the government truly believes the warnings of climate science. There are good things. The other 2009 budget flagship program, a 1000 MW coal carbon capture and storage power station, was noticeably de-emphasised in this 2010 budget. Maybe the government now tacitly accepts that CCS, a useless distraction from a serious decarbinisation strategy, is going nowhere. The coal industry won’t be sorry – it was from the beginning merely paying lip service to CCS. It will still get its huge coal transport infrastructure subsidies. There is a new board of a new body, the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy, chaired by the NSW Chief Scientist Professor Mary O’Kane, who advises government and companies on innovation, research, education and development. She has expertise in process and information (smart systems) engineering: let’s hope she is a fast learner on renewable energy technologies. There are welcome tax concessions for geothermal energy.   There is recent or new support for international renewable energy and energy efficiency bodies. There is 30 million for a public education program in climate science – this has been mocked as more government propaganda, but it is actually sorely needed after the damage done by the denialist lobby over the past two years to public understanding of climate change. Somebody needs to explain to the public how climate science (actually, any experimental science) works, and at what stage the accumulation of climate data in support of strong theory becomes an undeniable guide to public policy. If the public information program is designed in this way, it will be useful. Overall, while there will be some happier faces in the renewable energy industries – money always helps – there is still no sign in the 2010 budget of any over-riding national policy vision for decarbonisation. The Rudd government is still trotting out the old rhetoric, while indolently trying a few things out – fiddling while Australia’s climate security burns.   Kevin Rudd should – as many, not just in the Greens, are saying – be now looking now seriously at an interim flat-rate carbon tax. Yet, as I watched the Prime Minister’s now famous interview on the ABC 7. 30 Report on 12 May, I saw no sign of this. I believe he sincerely believes that he is trying his hardest on climate change now. He just isn’t yet joining the dots.   He doesn’t yet understand that rhetoric, argy-bargy with interest groups, and international conference gamesmanship doesn’t add up to a climate policy for a real and present global warming crisis. That crisis, for Kevin Rudd, is still somewhere off in vague Future-land. •   Tony Kevin is the author of Crunch Time (Scribe, 2009), a book exploring the politics of Australia’s inadequate policy response to the climate change crisis.
