5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing electropositive cations and basic anions ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Other ionic compounds are known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. If the compound is <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a reaction between a strong acid and a weak base, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> is an acidic salt. If it is <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a reaction between a strong base and a weak acid, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> is a basic salt. If it is <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a reaction between a strong acid and a strong base, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> is a neutral salt. Weak acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the conjugate base ion and conjugate acid ion, such as ammonium acetate.|$|E

5|$|If one removes from a 1-tree one of {{the edges}} in its cycle, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> is a tree. Reversing this process, if one augments a tree by {{connecting}} any two of its vertices by a new edge, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> is a 1-tree; the path in the tree connecting the two endpoints of the added edge, together with the added edge itself, form the 1-tree's unique cycle. If one augments a 1-tree by adding an edge that connects one of its vertices to a newly added vertex, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> is again a 1-tree, with one more vertex; an alternative method for constructing 1-trees is {{to start with a}} single cycle and then repeat this augmentation operation any number of times. The edges of any 1-tree can be partitioned in a unique way into two subgraphs, one of which is a cycle and the other of which is a forest, such that each tree of the forest contains exactly one vertex of the cycle.|$|E
