5|$|Anomalocaridids, such as Anomalocaris, were {{organism}}s {{thought to}} be distantly related to the arthropods. <b>These</b> <b>creatures</b> looked quite unlike any organism living todayâ€”they had segmented exoskeletons, with lateral lobes used for swimming, typically large compound eyes, often set on stalks, and most strikingly, a pair of large, claw-like great appendages that resembled headless shrimp. These appendages {{are thought to have}} passed food to the animal's mouth, which resembled a ring of sliced pineapple.|$|E
5|$|Helping Alisia in her quest are her pet monsters. <b>These</b> <b>creatures</b> {{fly around}} the heroine on their own, attacking her foes, and {{blocking}} enemy attacks from hitting her. There are four pets, {{each with its}} own type of attack. The Dragon Frye spits fireballs, and the Boomerang Lizard hurls boomerangs. The Thunder Raven emits a thunder blast that affects enemies across the screen, and the Ball O' Fire burns enemies on contact. Only one pet can fight alongside Alisia in her quest, but the player can select any of the four (or none) as the active companion at any time.|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} {{to all of}} this would be the Primal Zerg, who inhabit the original Zerg homeworld of Zerus (as seen in Heart of the Swarm). The Zerg Hive Mind was created to control the Zerg, and eventually put them {{under the control of the}} main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, managed to avoid being subsumed. These are the Primal Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not bound to the Overmind. <b>These</b> <b>creatures</b> are each independently sapient, and if they follow a leader it is because they choose to. Their lack of a Hive Mind also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive Mind.|$|E
50|$|Each match {{can involve}} the player {{controlling}} {{a number of}} creature units based upon mythical and real life animals and supernatural beings. The player may start with <b>these</b> <b>creature</b> units by using mercenaries or villagers, or add creature units per turn by casting a spell to summon them. Many of <b>these</b> <b>creature</b> units also have abilities to distinguish them from others in a more tangible way than merely by differing values such as attack rating.|$|R

5|$|Enemies {{range from}} camouflaged plants to large {{vultures}} to Komodo dragon-like lizards and huge leviathan in water. Many enemies can kill the Slugcat in one hit, and some species have internal variation, {{such as the}} pink lizards that can climb. The enemies spawn at random, such that the player cannot progress {{through trial and error}} experimentation. <b>These</b> <b>creatures</b> possess dynamic AI and exist in the game's world perpetually, even when not on the same screen as the player. The player does, however, need to experiment with spears to climb walls and knock fruit out of trees. The Slugcat can hold two objects at once and switch between them. It can also eat power-up plants, which grant status effects, such as slowing time.|$|E
5|$|Geneforge {{stemmed from}} the idea of {{creating}} a horde of creatures and the ability to care for those creatures or send them to their deaths. The choice was to be made by the player. From this point, Vogel considered who would be able to gain such powers, how they would control them and how <b>these</b> <b>creatures</b> would be treated. The game was developed with the intention of giving players choices; which factions to side with, how non-Shaper human outsiders are treated and whether to pursue goals through combat or diplomacy. Unlike most role-playing games, Geneforge was designed so that {{it would be possible to}} complete the game without using violence. Vogel cited , , Deus Ex and EverQuest as influences.|$|E
5|$|In Flow, {{the player}} guides a small, multi-segmented worm- or snake-like {{creature}} through an aquatic environment. There are no menus or guidelines; the game begins immediately. The game world, which is viewed from a top-down perspective, consists of two-dimensional planes stacked vertically upon each other. A blurred {{version of the}} layer below appears {{in the background of}} each plane. Planes contain organisms of varying sizes; the player's creature automatically attempts to consume them when they are nearby. The majority of <b>these</b> <b>creatures</b> are non-confrontational, and are composed of cells that increase the number of segments in the player's creature when eaten. All planes, except for the highest and lowest, contain two specially colored organisms that move the player's creature up or down one plane when touched.|$|E

5|$|In early {{editions of}} , many {{well-known}} legendary creatures were included {{such as the}} phoenix, dragon and manticore as well as cryptids like the satyrus, which Linnaeus collected into the catch-all category Paradoxa. Broberg thought Linnaeus was trying to offer a natural explanation and demystify the world of superstition. Linnaeus tried to debunk some of <b>these</b> <b>creatures,</b> as he had with the hydra; regarding the purported remains of dragons, Linnaeus wrote that they were either derived from lizards or rays. For Homo troglodytes he asked the Swedish East India Company to search for one, {{but they did not}} find any signs of its existence. Homo lar has since been reclassified as Hylobates lar, the lar gibbon.|$|E
5|$|Invertebrates {{constitute}} {{a vast array}} of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular eukaryotes such as Paramecium to such complex multicellular animals as the octopus, lobster and dragonfly. They {{constitute a}}bout 95% of the animal species. By definition, none of <b>these</b> <b>creatures</b> has a backbone. The cells of single-cell protozoans have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs. Locomotion is often provided by cilia or flagella or may proceed via the advance of pseudopodia, food may be gathered by phagocytosis, energy needs may be supplied by photosynthesis and the cell may be supported by an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton. Some protozoans can form multicellular colonies.|$|E
5|$|Paterson's worms are {{an attempt}} to {{simulate}} the behaviour of prehistoric worms. <b>These</b> <b>creatures</b> fed upon sediment {{at the bottom of}} ponds and avoided retracing paths they had already travelled because food would be scarce there but, because food occurred in patches, it was in the worm's interest to stay near previous trails. Different species of worm had different innate rules regarding how close to travelled paths to stay, when to turn, and how sharp a turn to make. In 1969 Raup and Seilacher created computer simulations of the fossilized worm trails, and these simulations inspired Paterson and Conway to develop a simple set of rules to study idealized worms on regular grids.|$|E

5|$|A world {{containing}} {{creatures who}} are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't cause or determine {{them to do}} only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not {{do what is right}} freely. To create creatures capable of moral good, therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give <b>these</b> <b>creatures</b> the freedom to perform evil {{and at the same time}} prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of moral evil. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.|$|E
5|$|Certain planes feature aggressive, multi-segmented {{creatures that}} perish {{when all of}} their {{segments}} are eaten by the player's creature; however, they can eat segments of the player's creature to regrow their own. <b>These</b> <b>creatures</b> release many cells upon death, which can restore {{the health of the}} player's creature, temporarily increase the size of its mouth, or cause it to sprout decorative protrusions. Players are not required to eat these or any other organisms; they may travel to higher or lower planes at any time. Being defeated by aggressive creatures does not result in death, but causes the player's creature to float to a higher plane. In the Flash version, the player can replay the game with a jellyfish-like organism by defeating an aggressive creature on the bottom plane. If the player reaches the bottom again, the creature there is their original worm-like creature, and defeating it starts the game over as that organism.|$|E
5|$|Escaping {{the castle}} is made {{difficult}} by shadow creatures {{sent by the}} Queen. <b>These</b> <b>creatures</b> attempt to drag Yorda into black vortexes if Ico leaves her {{for any length of}} time, or if she is in certain areas of the castle. Ico can dispel these shadows using a stick or sword and pull Yorda free if she is drawn into a vortex. While the shadow creatures cannot harm Ico, the game is over if Yorda becomes fully engulfed in a vortex; the player restarts from a save point. The player will also restart from a save point if Ico falls from a large height. Save points in the game are represented by stone benches that Ico and Yorda rest on as the player saves the game. In European and Japanese releases of the game, upon completion of the game, the player has the opportunity to restart the game in a local co-operative two-player mode, where the second player plays as Yorda, still under the same limitations as the computer-controlled version of the character.|$|E

5|$|While {{traveling}} the player is frequently attacked by monsters, which include shadowy figures called Shades, large animals, and robots. Defeating these enemies gives the player experience points that can increase Nier's power, and money {{that can be}} used to purchase items. Nier can attack <b>these</b> <b>creatures</b> with either a one- or two-handed sword, or a spear. These weapons can be customized to have greater damage and abilities using materials that can be purchased, dropped from monsters, or scavenged around the world. Multiple different varieties of each weapon type can be acquired. The player can also use magic spells, which require enough energy from a constantly regenerating amount to cast. These spells include projectiles and large shadowy fists, among others; new spells are acquired in the first half of the game by completing specific battles. In addition to the main plotline, Nier includes numerous side-quests, which give the player experience points and money, as well as fishing and farming segments.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Greek mythology {{contains}} several precursors {{to modern}} vampires, though none were considered undead; these included the Empusa, Lamia, and striges (the strix of Ancient Roman mythology). Over time {{the first two}} terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa {{was the daughter of}} the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic, bronze-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood. Lamia was the daughter of King Belus and a secret lover of Zeus. However Zeus' wife Hera discovered this infidelity and killed all Lamia's offspring; Lamia swore vengeance and preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood. Like Lamia, the striges feasted on children, but also preyed on young men. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as strix, a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on human flesh and blood. The Romanian vampire breed named StrigoÃ¯ has no direct relation to the Greek striges, but was derived from the Roman term strix, as {{is the name of the}} Albanian Shtriga and the Slavic Strzyga, though myths about <b>these</b> <b>creatures</b> are more similar to their Slavic equivalents. Greek vampiric entities are seen once again in Homer's epic Odyssey. In Homer's tale, the undead are too insubstantial to be heard by the living and cannot communicate with them without drinking blood first. In the epic, when Odysseus journeyed into Hades, he was made to sacrifice a black ram and a black ewe so that the shades there could drink its blood and communicate.|$|E
