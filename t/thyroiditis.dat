5|$|Inflammation of {{the thyroid}} is called <b>thyroiditis.</b> Inflamed thyroids may cause {{symptoms}} of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Two types <b>thyroiditis</b> initially present with hyperthyroidism and are sometimes {{followed by a}} period of hypothyroidism – Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis</b> and postpartum <b>thyroiditis.</b> There are other disorders that cause inflammation of the thyroid, and these include subacute <b>thyroiditis,</b> acute <b>thyroiditis,</b> silent <b>thyroiditis,</b> Riedel's <b>thyroiditis</b> and traumatic injury, including palpation <b>thyroiditis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis</b> is an {{autoimmune}} {{disorder in}} which the thyroid gland is infltrated by the lymphocytes B-cell and T-cells. These progressively destroy the thyroid gland. In this way, Hasimoto's <b>thyroiditis</b> may have occurred insidiously, and only be noticed when thyroid hormone production decreases, causing symptoms of hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's {{is more common in}} females than males, much more common after the age of 60, and has known genetic risk factors. Also more common in individuals with Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis</b> are type 1 diabetes, pernicious anaemia, Addison's disease vitiligo.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism {{is managed}} with {{replacement}} of the hormone thyroxine. This is usually given daily as an oral supplement, and may take {{a few weeks to}} become effective. Some causes of hypothyroidism, such as Postpartum <b>thyroiditis</b> and Subacute <b>thyroiditis</b> may be transient and pass over time, and other causes such as iodine deficiency may be able to be rectified with dietary supplementation.|$|E
5|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common cause of primary hypothyroidism and endemic goiter worldwide. In areas of the world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis</b> (chronic autoimmune <b>thyroiditis).</b> Hashimoto's may be associated with a goiter. It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.|$|E
5|$|After women give birth, about 5% develop {{postpartum}} <b>thyroiditis</b> {{which can}} occur up {{to nine months}} afterwards. This {{is characterized by a}} short period of hyperthyroidism followed by a period of hypothyroidism; 20–40% remain permanently hypothyroid.|$|E
5|$|Autoimmune <b>thyroiditis</b> is {{associated}} with other immune-mediated diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 1, pernicious anemia, myasthenia gravis, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. It may occur as part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (type 1 and type 2).|$|E
5|$|People with {{hypothyroidism}} {{often have}} no or only mild symptoms. Numerous symptoms and signs {{are associated with}} hypothyroidism, and {{can be related to}} the underlying cause, or a direct effect of having not enough thyroid hormones. Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis</b> may present with the mass effect of a goiter (enlarged thyroid gland).|$|E
5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hypothyroidism without any lumps or masses felt within the thyroid gland {{does not require}} thyroid imaging; however, if the thyroid feels abnormal, diagnostic imaging is then recommended. The presence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) makes {{it more likely that}} thyroid nodules are caused by autoimmune <b>thyroiditis,</b> but if there is any doubt, a needle biopsy may be required.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of {{the thyroid}} are functional–caused by {{dysfunction}} {{in the production}} of hormones, and nodes and tumors either benign or malignant. Functional disorders can cause inflammation as can some other forms of <b>thyroiditis.</b> Functional disorders can result in the overproduction or underproduction of hormones. Any of the functional thyroid disorders can result in the gland's enlargement and cause a swollen neck termed a goitre.|$|E
5|$|In {{veterinary}} practice, {{dogs are}} the species most commonly affected by hypothyroidism. The {{majority of cases}} occur {{as a result of}} primary hypothyroidism, of which two types are recognized: lymphocytic <b>thyroiditis,</b> which is probably immune-driven and leads to destruction and fibrosis of the thyroid gland, and idiopathic atrophy, which leads to the gradual replacement of the gland by fatty tissue. There is often lethargy, cold intolerance, exercise intolerance, and weight gain. Furthermore, skin changes and fertility problems are seen in dogs with hypothyroidism, {{as well as a number}} of other symptoms. The signs of myxedema can be seen in dogs, with prominence of skin folds on the forehead, and cases of myxedema coma are encountered. The diagnosis can be confirmed by blood test, as the clinical impression alone may lead to overdiagnosis. Lymphocytic <b>thyroiditis</b> is associated with detectable antibodies against thyroglobulin, although they typically become undetectable in advanced disease. Treatment is with thyroid hormone replacement.|$|E
5|$|Numerous authors {{described}} cretinism, myxoedema {{their relationship}} with the thyroid in the nineteenth century. Charles Mayo coined the term hyperthyroidism in 1910, Hakaru Hashimoto documented a case of Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis</b> in 1912, and autoantibodies were demonstrated in 1956. Knowledge of the thyroid and its conditions developed throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with many modern treatments and investigative modalities evolving throughout the mid twentieth century, including the use of radioactive iodine, thiouracil and fine needle aspiration.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{underlying}} form of thyroid disease associated with TPP is Graves' disease, a syndrome {{due to an}} autoimmune reaction that leads to overproduction of thyroid hormone. TPP has also been described in people with other thyroid problems such as <b>thyroiditis,</b> toxic nodular goiter, toxic adenoma, TSH-producing pituitary adenoma, excessive ingestion of thyroxine or iodine, and amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism.|$|E
5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical {{symptoms}} are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency {{is the most}} common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis</b> {{is the most common}} cause in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some forms of hypothyroidism can result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of {{the immune}} system can result in {{autoimmune}} diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis,</b> rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects {{of the immune}} system.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, {{too little}} iodine {{in the diet}} {{is the most common}} cause of hypothyroidism. In {{countries}} with enough iodine in the diet, {{the most common cause of}} hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis.</b> Less common causes include: previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels.|$|E
5|$|Subclinical {{hypothyroidism}} is a milder form of hypothyroidism {{characterized by}} an elevated serum TSH level, but with a normal serum free thyroxine level. This milder form of hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis.</b> In adults it is diagnosed when TSH levels are greater than 5 mIU/L and less than 10mIU/L. The presentation of subclinical hypothyroidism is variable and classic {{signs and symptoms of}} hypothyroidism may not be observed. Of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, a proportion will develop overt hypothyroidism each year. In those with detectable antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO), this occurs in 4.3%, while in those with no detectable antibodies, this occurs in 2.6%. Those with subclinical hypothyroidism and detectable anti-TPO antibodies who do not require treatment should have repeat thyroid function tests more frequently (e.g. yearly) compared with those who do not have antibodies.|$|E
5|$|The other iodine radioisotopes {{have much}} shorter half-lives, {{no longer than}} days. Some of them have medical {{applications}} involving the thyroid gland, where the iodine that enters the body is stored and concentrated. Iodine-123 has a half-life of thirteen hours and decays by electron capture to tellurium-123, emitting gamma radiation; it is used in nuclear medicine imaging, including single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and X-ray computed tomography (X-Ray CT) scans. Iodine-125 has a half-life of fifty-nine days, decaying by electron capture to tellurium-125 and emitting low-energy gamma radiation; the second-longest-lived iodine radioisotope, it has uses in biological assays, nuclear medicine imaging and in radiation therapy as brachytherapy to treat a number of conditions, including prostate cancer, uveal melanomas, and brain tumours. Finally, iodine-131, with a half-life of eight days, beta decays to an excited state of stable xenon-131 that then converts to the ground state by emitting gamma radiation. It is a common fission product and thus is present in high levels in radioactive fallout. It may then be absorbed through contaminated food, and will also accumulate in the thyroid. As it decays, it may cause damage to the thyroid. The primary risk from exposure {{to high levels of}} iodine-131 is the chance occurrence of radiogenic thyroid cancer in later life. Other risks include the possibility of non-cancerous growths and <b>thyroiditis.</b> The usual means of protection against the negative effects of iodine-131 is by saturating the thyroid gland with stable iodine-127 in the form of potassium iodide tablets, taken daily for optimal prophylaxis. However, iodine-131 may also be used for medicinal purposes in radiation therapy for this very reason, when tissue destruction is desired after iodine uptake by the tissue. Iodine-131 is also used as a radioactive tracer.|$|E
25|$|Having another {{autoimmune}} diseases is a {{risk factor}} to develop Hashimoto’s <b>thyroiditis,</b> and the opposite is also true. Autoimmune diseases most commonly associated to Hashimoto’s <b>thyroiditis</b> include celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, vitiligo, and alopecia.|$|E
25|$|Grave's Disease, Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis.</b> Grave's {{disease and}} Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis</b> are greatly {{increased}} {{in patients with}} CD. Grave's disease is an autoimmune hyperthyroidism, as GSE is a potentiator for autoimmune disease, but GD is more commonly found and avitaminosis of selenium and other minerals may {{be a factor in}} this increase.|$|E
25|$|There are {{multiple}} suggested {{mechanisms by which}} the pathology of Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis</b> develops.|$|E
25|$|Tamoxifen {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as part of a}} treatment plan for Riedel's <b>thyroiditis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Overt, {{symptomatic}} thyroid dysfunction is {{the most}} common complication, with about 5% of persons with subclinical hypothyroidism and chronic autoimmune <b>thyroiditis</b> progressing to thyroid failure every year. Transient periods of thyrotoxicosis (over-activity of the thyroid) sometimes occur, and rarely the illness may progress to full hyperthyroid Graves' disease with active orbitopathy (bulging, inflamed eyes). Rare cases of fibrous autoimmune <b>thyroiditis</b> present with severe dyspnea (shortness of breath) and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), resembling aggressive thyroid tumors – but such symptoms always improve with surgery or corticosteroid therapy. Primary thyroid B cell lymphoma affects fewer than one in a thousand persons, and it is more likely to affect those with long-standing autoimmune <b>thyroiditis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis,</b> {{also known}} as chronic {{lymphocytic}} <b>thyroiditis</b> and Hashimoto's disease, is an autoimmune disease in which the thyroid gland is gradually destroyed. Early on {{there may be no}} symptoms. Over time the thyroid may enlarge forming a painless goiter. Some people eventually develop hypothyroidism with its accompanying weight gain, feeling tired, constipation, depression, and general pains. After many years the thyroid typically shrinks in size. Potential complications include thyroid lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis {{is usually}} made by {{detecting}} {{elevated levels of}} anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) in the serum, but seronegative (without circulating autoantibodies) <b>thyroiditis</b> is also possible.|$|E
25|$|Hypothyroidism is {{a growing}} problem in the Rhodesian ridgeback, and this {{condition}} causes a multitude of symptoms, including weight gain and hair loss. Treatment for hypothyroidism in dogs consists of an inexpensive once-daily oral medication. Dr. Lorna Kennedy at the University of Manchester’s Centre for Integrated Genomic Medical Research in England has found the haplotype (group of genes), which, when present, double {{the chances of a}} Ridgeback becoming hypothyroid due to lymphocytic <b>thyroiditis.</b> This is important to the breed because lymphocytic <b>thyroiditis</b> is the overwhelming cause of hypothyroidism in ridgebacks.|$|E
25|$|In October 2013, Business Insider {{reported}} that Page's paralyzed vocal cords {{are caused by}} an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis,</b> and prevented him from undertaking Google quarterly earnings conference calls for an indefinite period.|$|E
25|$|SS is {{associated}} with a number of other medical conditions, many of which are autoimmune or rheumatic disorders, such as celiac disease, fibromyalgia, SLE (lupus), autoimmune <b>thyroiditis,</b> multiple sclerosis and spondyloarthropathy, and several malignancies, principally non-Hodgkin lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|Various autoantibodies may {{be present}} against thyroid peroxidase, {{thyroglobulin}} and TSH receptors, although {{a small percentage of}} people may have none of these antibodies present. As indicated in various twin studies a percentage of the population may also have these antibodies without developing Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis.</b> Nevertheless, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity is a substantial factor behind the apoptotic fall-out of Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis.</b> Activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CD8+ T-cells) in response to cell-mediated immune response affected by helper T-lymphocytes (CD4+ T-cells) is central to thyrocyte destruction. As is characteristic of type IV hypersensitivities, recruitment of macrophages is another effect of the helper T-lymphocyte activation, with Th1 axis lymphocytes producing inflammatory cytokines within thyroid tissue to further macrophage activation and migration into the thyroid gland for direct effect.|$|E
25|$|Thyroid {{problems}} have been identified by American breeders as a priority issue, together with epilepsy and hip dysplasia. As many as 1 in 6 Tollers may have autoimmune <b>thyroiditis.</b> Symptoms of thyroid problems includes weight gain, skin and hair problems including hair loss, weakness, cold intolerance or infertility.|$|E
25|$|Another theory {{suggests}} the female high tendency to get autoimmunity {{is due to}} an imbalanced X chromosome inactivation. The X-inactivation skew theory, proposed by Princeton University's Jeff Stewart, has recently been confirmed experimentally in scleroderma and autoimmune <b>thyroiditis.</b> Other complex X-linked genetic susceptibility mechanisms are proposed and under investigation.|$|E
25|$|Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis</b> is {{associated}} with CTLA-4 (Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte Antigen-4) gene polymorphisms. CTLA-4 downregulates., i.e. transmits an inhibitory signal to T cells so reduced functioning {{is associated}} with increased T-lymphocyte activity. A family history of thyroid disorders is common, with the HLA-DR5 gene most strongly implicated conferring a relative risk of 3 in the UK.|$|E
25|$|Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis</b> {{is thought}} to be due to a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include a family history of the condition and having another autoimmune disease. Diagnosis is confirmed with blood tests for TSH, T4, and antithyroid antibodies. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include Graves’ disease and nontoxic nodular goiter.|$|E
25|$|Hyperthyroidism {{almost always}} causes general eye {{symptoms}} like dryness and irritation, {{regardless of what}} the cause of the hyperthyroid state is. However, these need to be distinguished from Graves' ophthalmopathy, which can only occur in patients who have Graves' disease. (It may also, rarely, be seen in Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis,</b> primary hypothyroidism, and thyroid cancer).|$|E
25|$|Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis</b> affects about 5% of the {{population}} {{at some point in}} their life. It typically begins between the ages of 30 and 50 and is much more common in women than men. Rates of disease appear to be increasing. It was first described by the Japanese physician Hakaru Hashimoto in 1912. In 1957 it was recognized as an autoimmune disorder.|$|E
25|$|Hashimoto's <b>thyroiditis,</b> {{regardless}} of whether or not hypothyroidism is present, can be treated with levothyroxine. If hypothyroidism is not present some may recommend no treatment while others may treat to try to reduce the size of the goiter. Those affected should avoid eating large amounts of iodine; however, sufficient iodine is required especially during pregnancy. Surgery is rarely required to treat the goiter.|$|E
25|$|Health {{tests are}} {{available}} for both eye diseases and autoimmune <b>thyroiditis.</b> A test for Addison's disease is available {{but it is only}} for one form of the disease and there are other forms which also affect the breed. A test is also available for one form of cleft palate that is exclusive to Tollers. Early testing shows a carrier rate of about 15%.|$|E
