40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that <b>troxerutin,</b> a trihydroxyethylated derivative of natural bioflavonoid rutin, exhibits beneficial effects on diabetes-related symptoms. Here we investigated the effects of <b>troxerutin</b> on the enhancement of hepatic gluconeogenesis in high-fat diet (HFD) -treated mice and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Mice were divided into four groups: Control group, HFD group, HFD + <b>Troxerutin</b> group, and <b>Troxerutin</b> group. <b>Troxerutin</b> was treated by daily oral administration at doses of 150 mg/kg/day for 20 weeks. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) was used to inhibit endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). Our results showed that <b>troxerutin</b> effectively improved obesity and related metabolic parameters, and liver injuries in HFD-treated mouse. Furthermore, <b>troxerutin</b> significantly attenuated enhancement of hepatic gluconeogenesis in HFD-fed mouse. Moreover, <b>troxerutin</b> notably suppressed nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p 65 transcriptional activation and release of inflammatory cytokines in HFD-treated mouse livers. Mechanismly, <b>troxerutin</b> dramatically decreased Nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) expression, as well as interaction between NOD 1 / 2 with interacting protein- 2 (RIP 2), by abating oxidative stress-induced ER stress in HFD-treated mouse livers, which was confirmed by TUDCA treatment. These improvement effects of <b>troxerutin</b> on hepatic glucose disorders might be mediated by its anti-obesity effect. In conclusion, <b>troxerutin</b> markedly diminished HFD-induced enhancement of hepatic gluconeogenesis via its inhibitory effects on ER stress-mediated NOD activation and consequent inflammation, which might be mediated by its anti-obesity effect...|$|E

40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-related {{neurodegenerative}} disease linked with increased production and/or deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in the brain. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the possible neuroprotective effect of <b>troxerutin</b> on an animal model of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer model was induced by a single dose intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of Aβ 1 – 42 (5 nmol/ 5 μl). Thereafter, <b>troxerutin</b> (300 mg/kg) was gavaged for 14 days. The hippocampal malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were measured using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. In addition, the number of apoptotic cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) was assessed by TUNEL kit. The results showed that ICV microinjection of Aβ 1 - 42 increased MDA levels, reduced SOD and GPx, and increased AChE activities in the hippocampus. Chronic administration of <b>troxerutin</b> significantly attenuated MDA levels and AChE activity and increased SOD and GPx activities in the hippocampus. Moreover, the number of apoptotic cells was decreased by <b>troxerutin</b> treatment. Taken together, our study demonstrated that <b>troxerutin</b> could increase the resistance of hippocampal neurons against apoptosis, at least in part, by diminishing the activity of AChE and oxidative stress.

40|$|Background/Aims: <b>Troxerutin,</b> {{also known}} as vitamin P 4, has been {{commonly}} used {{in the treatment of}} chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) disease. However, its effect on in vivo myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, a model that closely mimics acute myocardial infarction in humans, is still unknown. Methods: The myocardial I/R injury rat model was created with <b>troxerutin</b> preconditioning. Myocardial infarct size was evaluated by the Evans blue-TTC method. Hemodynamic parameters, including the heart rate (HR), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), maximal rate of rise in blood pressure in the ventricular chamber (+dp/dt max), and maximal rate of decline in blood pressure in the ventricular chamber (-dp/dt max) were monitored. Serum TNF-α and IL- 10 were determined by ELISA kit. Cell apoptosis was detected by MTT method. Results: <b>Troxerutin</b> preconditioning significantly reduced myocardial infarct size, improved cardiac function, and decreased the levels of creatine kinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the I/R injury rat model. The serum and mRNA levels of TNF-α and IL- 10 as well as some apoptosis markers (Bax, Caspase 3) also decreased. Moreover, <b>troxerutin</b> pretreatment markedly increased the phosphorylation of Akt, and blocking PI 3 K activity by LY 294002 abolished the protective effect of <b>troxerutin</b> on I/R injury.

40|$|Abstract. Dermal papilla (DP) cells {{function}} as important regulators {{of the hair}} growth cycle. The loss of these cells is a primary cause of diseases characterized by hair loss, including alopecia, and evidence has revealed significantly increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in hair tissue and DP cells in the balding population. In the present study, <b>troxerutin,</b> a flavonoid derivative of rutin, was demonstrated to have a protective effect against H 2 O 2 -mediated cellular damage in human DP (HDP) cells. Biochemical assays revealed that pretreatment with <b>troxerutin</b> exerted a protective effect against H 2 O 2 -induced loss of cell viability and H 2 O 2 -induced cell death. Further experiments confirmed that <b>troxerutin</b> inhibited the H 2 O 2 -induced production of ROS and upregula-tion of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. Using microRNA (miRNA) microarrays, the present study identi-fied 24 miRNAs, which were differentially expressed in the troxerutin-pretreated, H 2 O 2 -treated HDP cells. Subsequent prediction using bioinformatics analysis revealed that the altered miRNAs were functionally involved in several cell signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase and WNT pathways. Overall, these results indicated that ROS-mediated cellular damage was inhibited by trox-erutin and suggested {{that the use of}} <b>troxerutin</b> may be an effective approach in the treatment of alopecia...|$|E

40|$|Galactomannans {{represent}} one of {{the most}} versatile classes of available materials for applications in many sectors, including pharmaceuticals. Galactomannans have gained attention in the latest years for applications in drug release systems. In this work, a previously extracted and purified galactomannans from Adenanthera pavonina (L.) and Dimorphandra gardneriana (Tul.) were modified by sulfation reaction. The sulfation reaction was effective to modify the galactomannans A. pavonina and D. gardneriana resulting in a substitution degree of 0. 61 and 0. 63 respectively which showed inhibition percentage (77 % and 94 % respectively) against dengue virus type 2. Galactomannans from A. pavonina (GLMAp) and D. gardneriana (GLMDg) and its sulfated derivatives (GLMApS and GLMDgS) were used as polymeric matrices for <b>troxerutin</b> and mangiferin encapsulation by spray-drying process. The efficiency of the different matrices for drug release was studied comparing the dissolution profile of the mixtures: <b>troxerutin</b> / (GLMAp); <b>troxerutin</b> / (GLMApS); mangiferin/(GLMDg) and mangiferin/(GLMDgS) in pH 1. 2, 4. 6 and 6. 8 buffer solutions, simulating gastric and intestinal media at 37 oC. The fastest release profile was found to be for the sulfated polymeric matrix. The faster release profile of the sulfated polymeric matrix (release rate, approximately 100 % after 8 h) when compared to the natural polymer (GLMDg / mangiferin - 82. 7 % and GLMAp / <b>troxerutin</b> - 95. 1 %) was due to the reduction of the molar mass and viscosities of the sulfated galactomannan caused by the depletion of the polymer during sulfation. The results show the potential of GLMAp, GLMApS, GLMDg and GLMDgS as bio-based drug delivery systems for the controlled release of bioactives. A galactomanana, polÃmero natural, representa uma das classes de materiais mais versÃteis, disponÃveis para aplicaÃÃes em diversas Ãreas, inclusive na farmacÃutica.

30|$|In conclusion, herein we {{developed}} a simple and effective screening strategy to identify chemical compounds modulating SG assembly/disassembly. A number of natural aromatic compounds had been identified to have the potency to modulate SG formation. The action of two highly effective and nontoxic compounds, C 13 (syringic acid) and C 85 (<b>troxerutin),</b> were verified for various subtypes of SGs induced by dissimilar stressors. More importantly, both compounds {{did not affect the}} formation of other types of cytoplasmic protein aggregates or RNA granules, suggesting that these two compounds were highly SG-specific and could be used to modulate SG formation in the cells without modifications of the other types of cellular bodies. A preliminary functional study indicated that the SG-promoting compound C 85 impaired both cellular stress response and recovery from stressed conditions. The SG-dissociating compound C 13 had complicated effect on stress response but facilitate recovery after the cells were released from stressors. Our results suggested that there do have SG-specific modulators although the microscopic visible membraneless organelles share some common assembly/disassembly mechanism. Screening using a larger library combined with structural design will provide more SG-specific modulators with higher efficiency. Meanwhile, herein we only performed a preliminary functional study of SGs using these modulators. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanism of these compounds and their cellular consequence by modulating SG assembly/disassembly.|$|E
40|$|Background Lymphoedema is the {{accumulation}} of excess fluid in the body caused by obstruction of the lymphatic drainage mechanisms. Treatment with Benzo-pyrones is thought to reduce fluid forming in the subcutaneous tissues and reduce pain and discomfort of the affected area. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of benzo-pyrones compared to placebo {{in the management of}} lymphoedema. Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group register (September 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2003), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, UnCover, PASCAL, SIGLE, reference lists produced by The British Lymphology Society, the National Research Register (NRR) and The International Society of Lymphology congress proceedings. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing Benzo-pyrones with placebo. Data collection and analysis Trials were selected for eligibility and tested for quality by two blinded reviewers who independently extracted data. Meta-analysis was not performed due to the poor quality of the trials. Main results Fifteen trials were included. Three oxerutin trials tested the same dose over 6 months against placebo and included a total of 127 participants (data were available for 81). There were insufficient data from these to calculate the per cent reduction or increase in baseline excess limb volume. One trial testing Cyclo 3 Fort (approved name) was found (57 participants) but insufficient data was provided to allow a proper analysis of its findings. A single trial of Daflon (approved name) was found (104 participants) but this also provided insufficient information to reach a conclusion about the effectiveness of the drug. Three trials of coumarin combined with <b>troxerutin</b> were found which tested two different doses of the drug against each other with no placebo, however participant numbers and baseline data were not provided. Eight trials of coumarin were identified. Two of these reported the same trial and the other potentially also referred to the same trial but this could not be confirmed. A further two papers also appeared to refer to the same trial but again this was unconfirmed. Five studies added anti-filarial drugs to the interventions tested. Participant data could not be extracted and the reporting of outcome measures in most was unclear.
