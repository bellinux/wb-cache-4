5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy. There is currently a crisis of decreasing number of available care workers for an increasing population requiring care. One reason why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV/AIDS affects working age people the most, {{and there has been}} evidence to show that women are affected at a younger age and in greater numbers. Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount of care work and community work <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> to do. Because of the lack of care workers available, the very young and the very old have also started participating in care work, resulting in poorer quality of care.|$|E

5|$|Tracy Jordan's storyline {{in which}} his former nanny writes a tell-all book {{revealing}} {{that he has never}} actually had an affair with anyone mirrored—though in reversal—the real life of professional golfer Tiger Woods' extramarital affairs scandal that occurred in late 2009. In one scene, it is revealed <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> come forward admitting to never have had a sexual relationship with Tracy; After news broke of Woods's infidelities, numerous women came forward admitting to having affairs with the golfer. To re-establish his womanizing persona, Tracy holds a press conference announcing he is leaving show business {{to spend more time with}} a stripper; In December 2009, Woods announced he would take an indefinite leave from professional golf to focus on his marriage after he admitted infidelity. Other women, who Tracy did not have a relationship with, have released voice mails to the news media. In one of them, Tracy leaves a message to his wife, Angie (Sherri Shepherd), in which he is loving and sincere in the message; One of Woods's mistress produced voice and text messages as evidence of a relationship with the golfer. As a result of him being outed as monogamous, Tracy loses various endorsements; After admitting to his affairs, Woods lost various endorsement deals with different companies.|$|E
25|$|Studies suggest gender {{differences}} in the reminiscence bump. Researchers found that men have more positive life events in their thirties and <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> more positive life events in their twenties. This finding suggests that the timing of important positive life events, such as marriage or employment, differ for men and women. Most of the major life events start between the age of 15 and 30 but there is a small gender difference shown here with respect to when the event takes place. Researchers found <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> a slightly earlier bump than men. The earlier age of the bump in women may be attributed to earlier hormonal changes in adolescence.|$|E

25|$|Domestic {{workers are}} those who perform a variety of tasks for and in other peoples' homes. For example, they may cook / clean the house and look after children. Yet they are often {{the ones with the}} least consideration, {{excluded}} from labour and social protection.

25|$|In Casey, {{the plaintiffs}} {{challenged}} five {{provisions of the}} Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982 authored by Rep. Stephen F.

The majority in Roe further held <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> a privacy interest protecting their right to abortion embedded in the liberty clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

25|$|Hrdy's {{hypothesis}} {{is an extension}} of the male assistance hypothesis, in that both hypotheses argue <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> evolved this adaptation to gain some tangible benefit from males. According to Hrdy's hypothesis, extended female sexuality is an adaptive process with an aim of creating paternity confusion in their male counterparts. Paternity confusion refers to the male being unsure as to whether offspring are genetically his own. If the female mates with different males (at all points of her ovarian cycle) whilst concealing fertility, then the males will inevitably have paternity confusion.|$|E

25|$|Promiscuities {{reports on}} and {{analyzes}} the shifting patterns of contemporary adolescent sexuality. Wolf argues that literature {{is rife with}} examples of male coming-of-age stories, covered autobiographically by D. H. Lawrence, Tobias Wolff, J. D. Salinger, and Ernest Hemingway, and covered misogynistically by Henry Miller, Philip Roth, and Norman Mailer. Wolf insists, however, that female accounts of adolescent sexuality have been systematically suppressed. She adduces cross-cultural material to demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>have,</b> across history, been celebrated as more carnal than men. Wolf also argues that women must reclaim the legitimacy of their own sexuality by shattering the polarization of women between virgin and whore.|$|E
25|$|According to Andrew Beveridge, a Professor of Sociology at Queens College, between 2000 and 2005, {{young women}} in their twenties earned more than their male {{counterparts}} in some large urban centers, including Dallas (120%), New York (117%), Chicago, Boston, and Minneapolis. A major reason for this is <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> been graduating from college in larger numbers than men, and that many of those women seem to be gravitating toward major urban areas. In 2005, 53% of women in their 20s working in New York were college graduates, compared with only 38% of men of that age. Nationwide, the wages of that group of women averaged 89% of the average full-time pay for men between 2000 and 2005.|$|E
25|$|Learned {{helplessness}} theory {{posits that}} because human bodies are only alterable {{to a certain}} point, people {{develop a sense of}} body shame and anxiety from which they create a feeling of helplessness in relation to correcting their physical appearance and helplessness in being able to control the way in which others perceive their appearance. This lack of control often results in depression. In relating to a lack of motivation, objectification theory states <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> less control in relationships and the work environment because they have to depend on the evaluation of another who is typically basing their evaluation on physical appearance. Since the dependence on another's evaluation limits a woman's ability to create her own positive experiences and motivation, it adversely increases her likelihood for depression. Furthermore, sexual victimization may be a cause. Specifically, victimization within the workplace degrades women. Harassment experienced every day wears on a woman, and sometimes results in a state of depression.|$|E

25|$|Many people {{dedicated}} {{their time}} to creating memorials and funds in Lloyd's name post death. A significant amount of effort was put into creating these, which shows {{just how much of}} an impact she made on the life of her students. There is not much released to the public about Lloyd despite her being a figure who fought for educational programs to benefit women at a time when progressive movements had not taken preeminence. This is most clearly shown in a correspondence between the editor of A Biographical Dictionary and Mary T. Bromage, who spent significant time on a biography of Lloyd over whether she {{should be included in the}} dictionary. The editor, Edward James believed Lloyd did not have much influence outside of Michigan despite her numerous leadership positions before her death. Nevertheless, her legacy continues to live on to this day and is seen in the numerous advancements <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> made at the University of Michigan and in higher education as a whole.|$|E
