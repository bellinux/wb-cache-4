40|$|This paper reconciles two, apparently, {{contradictory}} {{facts about}} the Spanish economy: real GDP per working age person has grown at 2. 4 percent during the period 1996 - 2007, on average, whereas Total Factor Productivity has been stagnant during that period. Here we argue that the Spanish economy has grown, in spite of stagnant TFP, because investment in structures has been heavily subsidized. This inefficiently high rate of investment in structures {{is the main reason}} for the increase in hours worked observed during that period. We use a three sector model economy where we distinguish between equipment and structures to quantify the sources of changes in measured TFP in Spain. We find that measured TFP is low because Investment- Specific Technical Change in Spain is very low. A calibrated version of this model is able to reproduce very well the growth experience of Spain for the period 1970 - 2007. We use the model economy <b>to</b> <b>quantify</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of direct and indirect subsidies to structures and the gains of eliminating them in terms of TFP and income growth. Our three sector model economy also allows us <b>to</b> <b>quantify</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> in measured TFP of the housing price boom experienced during the 2000 s...|$|E

To this end, a decision analysis model was created over a 4 -year period, <b>to</b> <b>quantify</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of treatments, procedures and adverse events, as well as the benefits expressed as survival rates and reduced lost workdays. The results show that, since the treatment with Hyalubrix® enables to avoid or delay the need for Total Hip Replacement (THR) surgery, it is possible to reduce mortality, adverse events and total costs. Hyalubrix®, given in the hip by ultrasound-guided intra-articular injection as an alternative to surgery is the most favourable option, helping preserve the survival rate over a 4 -year period, of approximately 1 in 100 patients considered candidates for THR, preserve work capacity for a total differential amount of 500 days, and achieve considerable savings in economic terms, of approximately 550, 000 € and 600, 000 € euros from the NHS and the Societal perspectives, respectively.
