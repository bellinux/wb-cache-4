Of the nine sugars identified from methanolic extracts of seven grass species, only <b>turanose,</b> a sucrose isomer, was {{negatively correlated with}} the survival and growth of the noctuid larva of cereal stemborer, Busseola fusca. Sucrose was the most abundant sugar, although it did not vary significantly in concentration among the plant species studied. Using Styrofoam (TM) cylinders impregnated with increasing concentrations of <b>turanose</b> or sucrose, the two sugars had opposing effects: <b>turanose</b> appeared phagodeterrent while sucrose was phagostimulatory. Electrophysiological studies indicated that B. fusca larvae were able to detect both sugars via their styloconic sensilla located on the mouthparts. The findings indicate that, whereas sucrose is a feeding stimulant and positively influences food choice by B. fusca larvae, <b>turanose</b> negatively contributes to larval food choice. The balance in concentrations of both sugars, however, somehow influences the overall host plant choice made by the larvae. This can partly explain host plant suitability and choice by this caterpillar pest in the field...|$|E
40|$|Amylosucrases are sucrose-utilizing alpha-transglucosidases that {{naturally}} catalyze {{the synthesis of}} alpha-glucans, linked exclusively through alpha 1, 4 -linkages. Side products and in particular sucrose isomers such as <b>turanose</b> and trehalulose are also produced by these enzymes. Here, we report the first structural and biophysical characterization of the most thermostable amylosucrase identified so far, the amylosucrase from Deinoccocus geothermalis (DgAS). The three-dimensional structure revealed a homodimeric quaternary organization, never reported before for other amylosucrases. A sequence signature of dimerization was identified from {{the analysis of the}} dimer interface and sequence alignments. By rigidifying the DgAS structure, the quaternary organization is likely to participate in the enhanced thermal stability of the protein. Amylosucrase specificity with respect to sucrose isomer formation (<b>turanose</b> or trehalulose) was also investigated. We report the first structures of the amylosucrases from Deinococcus geothermalis and Neisseria polysaccharea in complex with <b>turanose.</b> In the amylosucrase from N. polysaccharea (NpAS), key residues were found to force the fructosyl moiety to bind in an open state with the O 3 ' ideally positioned to explain the preferential formation of <b>turanose</b> by NpAS. Such residues are either not present or not similarly placed in DgAS. As a consequence, DgAS binds the furanoid tautomers of fructose through a weak network of interactions to enable <b>turanose</b> formation. Such topology at subsite + 1 is likely favoring other possible fructose binding modes in agreement with the higher amount of trehalulose formed by DgAS. Our findings help to understand the inter-relationships between amylosucrase structure, flexibility, function, and stability and provide new insight for amylosucrase design...|$|E
40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the {{regulatory}} mechanisms of sugar signaling in plants, the effect of derivatives of the transport sugar sucrose (Suc), the Suc isomers palatinose and <b>turanose,</b> and the Suc analog fluoro-Suc were tested. Photo-autotrophic suspension culture cells of tomato (Lycopersicon peruvianum) were used to study their effect on the regulation of marker genes of source and sink metabolism, photosynthesis, and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Suc and glucose (Glc) resulted in reverse regulation of source and sink metabolism. Whereas the mRNA level of extracellular invertase (Lin 6) was induced, the transcript level of small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RbcS) was repressed. In contrast, <b>turanose,</b> palatinose, and fluoro-Suc only rapidly induced Lin 6 mRNA level, whereas the transcript level of RbcS was not affected. The differential effect of the metabolizable and non-metabolizable sugars on RbcS mRNA regulation was reflected {{by the fact that}} only Suc and Glc inhibited photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence. The activation of different signal transduction pathways by sugars was further supported by the analysis of the activation of MAPKs. MAPK activity was found to be strongly activated by <b>turanose,</b> palatinose, and fluoro-Suc, but not by Suc and Glc. To analyze the role of sugars in relation to pathogen perception, an elicitor preparation of Fusarium oxysporum lycopersici was used. The strong activation of MAPKs and the fast and transient induction of Lin 6 expresssion by the fungal elicitor resembles the effect of <b>turanose,</b> palatinose, and fluoro-Suc and indicates that non-metabolizable sugars are sensed as stress-related stimuli...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Most {{biological}} fluids contain both {{neutral and}} acid α-glucosidase. Optimal conditions were there-fore {{developed for the}} selective determination of the activity of neutral and acid ot-glucosidase, using 2 -step, discontinuous assays. In the first Step of the assay of neutral α-glucosidase, glucose was liberated from maitose (citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 6. 8, 20 mmol/ 1 maitose, 25 mmol/ 1 <b>turanose).</b> Under these incubation condi-tions, <b>turanose</b> inhibited the residual activity of acid α-glucosidase alnjost completely without influencing the activity of neutral α-glucosidase.

Under these incu-bation conditions, potassium ions stimulate the activity of acid α-glucosidase and simultaneously inhibit al-most completely the residual activity of neutral α-glucosidase.

Fructose and glucose are the highest sugars in honey with an average value of 36 % and 26 %, respectively. The 1 stDer spectra with MSC or SLS in the wave number range from 1500 to 750 cm(- 1) provide the best calibration model with a r(2) of 86. 60 and 86. 01 with RPD of 2. 6 and 2. 55, respectively for fructose and glucose.

However, when H 2 gas is provided, A. vinelandii can grow mixotrophically with H 2 as the energy source and mannose as the carbon source (T. -Y. Wong and R. J. Maier, J. Bacteriol. 163 : 528 - 533, 1985). In this report, seven sugars {{were used to determine}} whether A. vinelandii could derive energy from these sugars for mannose utilization. Supplementation of fructose- or galactose-limited medium with mannose did not influence the biomass produced by N 2 -fixing A. vinelandii.

40|$|Trehalose {{is absorbed}} by two {{distinct}} systems—one constitutive, the other induced by <b>turanose</b> {{and to a}} lesser extent by nigerose but not by trehalose. The constitutive system is apparently mediated by a surface trehalase; the induced system has the characteristics of a permease. The specificity of the induced system is apparently limited to the α glucosyl-glucose or glucosyl-fructose linkage, because absorption of kojibiose, nigerose, maltose, isomaltose, <b>turanose,</b> sucrose, and melezitose, in addition to that of trehalose, was increased. Absorption of β-linked or of galactose-containing disaccharides was not increased. The constitutive and induced trehalose-absorbing systems differ in their activity, specificity, lability to acid treatment, effects of substrate concentration, and pH optima. Both systems require oxygen, and no marked differential effects of inhibitors were observed. The activity of the induced system is proportional to log <b>turanose</b> concentration (from about 1 to 300 μg/ml), and is an approximate linear function of time of exposure (from about 1 to 50 min). Accumulation of trehalose occurred against a concentration gradient in both systems but particularly in the induced. No leakage was observed. The activity of the induced system declined slowly upon removal of the inducer. Accumulated trehalose is metabolized after activation by azide as are the endogenous trehalose reserves. The accumulated trehalose appears to enter the endogenous trehalose pool found in these spores, although some data suggest it may be more accessible. Respiratory data indicate that absorbed trehalose is available for metabolism while in transit from the external membrane to the internal pool...|$|E

40|$|Starch {{branching}} enzyme (SBE) {{activity in the}} cassava storage root exhibited a diurnal fluctuation, dictated by a transcriptional oscillation of the corresponding SBE genes. The peak of SBE activity coincided {{with the onset of}} sucrose accumulation in the storage, and we conclude that the oscillatory mechanism keeps the starch synthetic apparatus in the storage root sink in tune with the flux of sucrose from the photosynthetic source. When storage roots were uncoupled from the source, SBE expression could be effectively induced by exogenous sucrose. <b>Turanose,</b> a sucrose isomer that cannot be metabolized by plants, mimicked the effect of sucrose, demonstrating that downstream metabolism of sucrose was not necessary for signal transmission. Also glucose and glucose- 1 -P induced SBE expression. Interestingly, induction by sucrose, <b>turanose</b> and glucose but not glucose- 1 -P sustained an overt semidian (12 -h) oscillation in SBE expression and was sensitive to the hexokinase (HXK) inhibitor glucosamine. These results suggest a pivotal regulatory role for HXK during starch synthesis. Abscisic acid (ABA) was another potent inducer of SBE expression. Induction by ABA was similar to that of glucose- 1 -P in that it bypassed the semidian oscillator. Both the sugar and ABA signaling cascades were disrupted by okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase inhibitor. Based on these findings, we propose a model for sugar signaling in regulation of starch synthesis in the cassava storage root...|$|E

Two sucrose analogs were applied at post-veraison to determine their effects on leaf photosynthesis. It is hypothesized that the signal of sugar accumulation in leaves will bring a reduction in photosynthesis and an increase in the photosynthate translocation rate to the berries. The experiment was conducted in a commercial Vitis vinifera âFlameâ vineyard. The sucrose analogs used were palatinose and <b>turanose</b> at 5 mM. For each treatment, five fully expanded leaves from five different vines were sprayed until run-off. Control leaves were treated with distilled water. Net photosynthesis rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) and leaf temperature (Lt) were measured at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min after the treatment with a LICOR- 6200 portable photosynthesis system. Statistical analysis was made by variance analysis based on a randomized complete block design and means separated using the Student-Newman-Keuls test with a confidence level of 0. 05. The application of <b>turanose</b> did not affect Pn whereas palatinose reduced the Pn one hour after application. At this point, not statistical differences were found in gs and PAR.

40|$|Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a root crop, {{one of the}} world’s most {{important}} but under-exploited staple food crops and source of income. It is a high starch producer with levels between 73. 7 and 84. 9 % of its total storage root dry weight. Increasingly, {{there is a need}} for diverse novel starches for both food and non-food applications. In response, sbeII encoding starch branching enzyme II was cloned. The relationship between spatial-temporal expression patterns of starch synthesis genes and the plasticity of the storage root development states was examined. To gain further insight into the transcriptional activity of sbe, diurnal transcript abundances, sugar and hormone signaling were studied. Results showed that the transcriptional activity of sbe increased with the developmental states of the storage root. Analysis of sbe diurnal transcript patterns identified the existence of an endogenous semidian oscillator (12 h) in the storage root cells but its nature and function remains unknown. To elucidate the relationship between sbe expression and sugar status; a combination of biochemical, genomic, histological and therapeutic approaches were used. In these analyses, sucrose was identified as the main signal that mediates transcriptional induction of sbe. Other identified effectors were abscisic acid (ABA), glucose, glucose- 1 -phosphate (G- 1 -P) and <b>turanose.</b> Repeated experimentation located the semidian oscillator upstream of G- 1 -P/G- 6 -P but downstream of glucose at the level of hexokinase. The discovery that sbe expression is not induced by mannose, mannitol, 3 -O-methyl- glucose and palatinose, but <b>turanose,</b> uncovered the existence of a sucrose transporter (SUT) and/or sensor. Notably, the induced sbe expression profile and level, and the biochemical properties of sucrose and <b>turanose</b> suggested that the SUT might as well as serve a sensor, although the existence of an independent extracellular sensor was not precluded. It was also shown that sucrose and ABA singly or in combination mediate sbe expression, and ABA by itself or with sucrose decouples the endogenous semidian oscillator via a bypass mechanism. Furthermore, it was revealed that either sucrose or ABA is not sufficient to promote maximal sbe expression, but the dual additive interactive effect is essential. The study also revealed the importance of protein phosphatases, protein kinases and first evidence for plastid de novo protein synthesis in the regulation of sbe expression. Okadaic acid, which preferentially inhibits type 1 and 2 A protein phosphatases, PP 1 and PP 2 A, respectively, abolished sbe expression, in the presence or absence of other effectors, i. e., sucrose, glucose, G- 1 -P, <b>turanose</b> and ABA. Conversely, cantharidin, a potent inhibitor of PP 2 A, did not, suggesting that sugar and ABA signaling pathways converge at the PP 1 level downstream of the sugar signaling pathway. Chloramphenicol, which specifically inhibits plastid de novo protein synthesis, with or without sucrose, blocked sbe expression but cycloheximide, a cytosolic de novo protein synthesis inhibitor, did not, suggesting a role of plastid de novo protein synthesis in the regulation of sbe. The emerging implications from this study have been summarised into a working regulatory model for sbe expression. In summary, this work has established that sbe transcriptional activity depends on the plasticity of the storage root growth and development states, rhythmicity of an endogenous semidian oscillator, interactive effects of sucrose and ABA signaling pathways, plastid de novo protein synthesis, and dephosphorylation events...|$|E

Koningsberger, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 204 : 590 - 609, 1970; R. Serrano, Eur. J. Biochem. 80 : 97 - 102, 1977). However, Saccharomyces contains multiple alpha-glucoside transport systems, and these studies have never been performed on a genetically defined strain shown to have only a single permease gene. In this study we isolated maltose-negative mutants in a MAL 6 strain and, using a high-resolution mapping technique, we showed that one class of these mutants, the group A mutants, mapped to the MAL 61 gene (a member of the MAL 6 gene complex). An insertion into the N-terminal-coding region of MAL 61 resulted in the constitutive production of MAL 61 mRNA and rendered the maltose permease similarly constitutive. Transformation by high-copy-number plasmids containing the MAL 61 gene also led to an increase in the maltose permease. A deletion-disruption of MAL 61 completely abolished maltose transport activity. Taken together, these results prove that this strain has only a single maltose permease and that this permease is the product of the MAL 61 gene. This permease is able to transport maltose and <b>turanose</b> but cannot transport maltotriose, alpha-methylglucoside, or melezitose. The construction of strains with only a single permease will allow us to identify other maltose-inducible transport systems by simple genetic tests and should lead to the identification and characterization of the multiple genes and gene products involved in alpha-glucoside transport in Saccharomyces yeasts...|$|E

BxlA showed about sixfold higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) than BxlB towards para-nitrophenyl b-D-xylopyranoside (pNPX) and b- 1, 4 -xylo-oligosaccharides (degree of polymerisation 2 – 6). For both enzymes kcat/Km decreased with increasing b- 1, 4 -xylo-oligosaccharide chain length. Using pNPX as donor with 9 monosaccharides, 7 disaccharides and two sugar alcohols as acceptors 18 different b-xylosyl-oligosaccharides were synthesised in 2 – 36 % (BxlA) and 6 – 66 % (BxlB) yields by transxylosylation. BxlA utilised the monosaccharides D-mannose, D-lyxose, D-talose, D-xylose, D-arabinose, L-fucose, D-glucose, D-galactose and D-fructose as acceptors, whereas BxlB used the same except for D-lyxose, D-arabinose and L-fucose. BxlB transxylosylated the disaccharides xylobiose, lactulose, sucrose, lactose and <b>turanose</b> in upto 35 % yield, while BxlA gave inferior yields on these acceptors.

Furthermore, transxylosylation of certain acceptors resulted in mixtures. Some of these products are also novel, but the structures of the individual products could not be determined...|$|E
40|$|The red {{imported}} fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren, {{is considered}} an oil-loving feeder, however, carbohydrates are essential ingredients in the diet of the fire ant also. Comprehensive screening of mono-, di-, and tri-saccharides demonstrated that glucose, fructose, fucose, sucrose, maltose, <b>turanose</b> and raffinose were significant phagostimulants for fire ant workers. It was also found that while D-glucose and L-fucose, the naturally occurring isomers, were active, the opposite diastereomers were not. Any structural modification of the glucose molecule resulted in loss of activity. None of the sugar alcohols evaluated were active. The fire ant is an agricultural pest and the many reports of fire ant damage to food crops {{may be linked to}} their need for dietary carbohydrates. A knowledge of carbohydrate phagostimulants may help to understand specificity of fire ant/plant interactions...|$|E
40|$|The {{association}} of plant cell wall components with A. oryzae’s extracellular enzyme machinery was investigated {{by analyzing the}} transcriptome profile {{in relation to the}} chemical structure of the carbon sources. Strain RIB 40 of A. oryzae was cultured on various carbon sources, namely cellohexaose, mannohexaose, xylopentaose, arabinoheptaose, glucohexaose, glucosyl maltotriosyl maltotriose, galactosyl mannotriose, <b>turanose</b> and sophorose, and the transcribed genes were determined with DNA microarrays. The statistically significant genes were selected and potential novel hydrolases were identified. Presently, we aim at the heterologous expression and characterization of seven different hypothetical and non classified proteins of A. oryzae, which could prove to be useful tools in the wood biomass separation and modification process. This work represents a novel way of integrating computational chemical biology and classical enzyme research for improving lignocellulose bioconversion...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the sugar-sensing processes modulating the expression of α-amylase in barley (Hordeum vulgaris L. var Himalaya) embryos. The results highlight the existence of independent glucose (Glc) and disaccharides sensing. Glc treatment destabilizes the α-amylase mRNA. Non-metabolizable disaccharides repress α-amylase induction, but have no effects on transcript stability. Structure-function analysis indicates that a fructose (Fru) moiety is needed for disaccharide sensing. Lactulose (β-galactose [Gal][1 → 4]Fru), palatinose (Glc[1 → 6]Fru), and <b>turanose</b> (Glc[1 → 3]Fru) are not metabolized but repress α-amylase. Disrupting the fructosyl moiety of lactulose and palatinose, or replacing the Fru moiety of β-Gal[1 → 4]Fru with Glc or Gal results in molecules unable to repress α-amylase. Comparison of the molecular requirements for sucrose transport with those for disaccharide sensing suggests that these sugars are perceived possibly at the plasma membrane level independently from sucrose transport...|$|E
40|$|Two α-glucosidase-encoding genes (agl 1 and agl 2) from Bifidobacterium breve UCC 2003 were {{identified}} and characterized. Based on their similarity to characterized carbohydrate hydrolases, the Agl 1 and Agl 2 enzymes are both assigned to a subgroup of the glycosyl hydrolase family 13, the α- 1, 6 -glucosidases (EC 3. 2. 1. 10). Recombinant Agl 1 and Agl 2 into which a His 12 sequence was incorporated (Agl 1 His and Agl 2 His, respectively) exhibited hydrolytic activity towards panose, isomaltose, isomaltotriose, and four sucrose isomers—palatinose, trehalulose, <b>turanose,</b> and maltulose—while also degrading trehalose and, to a lesser extent, nigerose. The preferred substrates for both enzymes were panose, isomaltose, and trehalulose. Furthermore, the pH and temperature optima for both enzymes were determined, showing that Agl 1 His exhibits higher thermo and pH optima than Agl 2 His. The two purified α- 1, 6 -glucosidases were also shown to have transglycosylation activity, synthesizing oligosaccharides from palatinose, trehalulose, trehalose, panose, and isomaltotriose...|$|E
40|$|Fusobacterium mortiferum {{utilizes}} sucrose [glucose-fructose in a(1 ! 2) linkage] and {{its five}} isomeric a-D-glucosyl-D-fructoses as energy sources for growth. Sucrose-grown cells are induced for both sucrose- 6 -phosphate hydrolase (S 6 PH) and fructokinase (FK), {{but the two}} enzymes are not expressed above constitutive levels during growth on the isomeric compounds. Extracts of cells grown previously on the sucrose isomers trehalulose a(1 ! 1), <b>turanose</b> a(1 ! 3), maltulose a(1 ! 4), leucrose a(1 ! 5) and palatinose a(1 ! 6) contained high levels of an NADM plus metal-dependent phospho-a-glucosidase (MalH). The latter enzyme was not induced during growth on sucrose. MalH catalysed the hydrolysis of the 6 H-phosphorylated derivatives of the five isomers to yield glucose 6 -phosphate and fructose, but sucrose 6 -phosphate itself was not a substrate. Unexpectedly, MalH hydrolysed both a- and b-linked stereomers of the chromogenic analogue p-nitrophenyl glucoside 6 -phosphate. The gene malH is adjacent to malB and malR, which encode an EII(CB) component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar:phosphotransferase system and...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was the {{characterisation}} of ‘Serra da Lousã’ heather honey by using novel statistical methodology, relevant principal component analysis, in order to assess the correlations between production year, locality and composition. Herein, we also report its chemical composition in terms of sugars, glycerol and ethanol, and physicochemical parameters. Sugars profiles from ‘Serra da Lousã’ heather and ‘Terra Quente de Tra´ s-os-Montes’ lavender honeys were compared and allowed the discrimination: ‘Serra da Lousã’ honeys do not contain sucrose, generally exhibit lower contents of <b>turanose,</b> trehalose and maltose and higher contents of fructose and glucose. Different localities from ‘Serra da Lousã ’ provided groups of samples with high and low glycerol contents. Glycerol and ethanol contents were revealed to be independent of the sugars profiles. These data and statistical models can be very useful in the comparison and detection of adulterations during the quality control analysis of ‘Serra da Lousã’ honey. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Spores of {{the fungus}} Myrothecium verrucaria are cryptic to maltose and isomaltose. Induction of a {{transport}} {{system can be}} effected by several sugars whose order of effectiveness is: <b>turanose</b> > maltulose > sucrose > d-arabinose, d-fructose, nigerose, maltotriulose, kestose > melezitose, raffinose, nystose, and stachyose. The transport system is not specific to maltose and isomaltose, and it is apparently identical to an induced trehalose permease described previously. Induction of the permease is markedly influenced by spore age—older spores being more responsive. Pure maltose is not absorbed by spores. Absorption of commercial reagent-grade maltose is due to permease induction by maltulose as an impurity. Maltulose contamination of maltose was demonstrated by charcoal column chromatography and comparison of its physical, chemical, and permease-inductive properties with those of authentic maltulose. Maltose accumulates temporarily in spores after absorption and then decreases, although no conversion to glucose can be detected. Although spores contain small quantities of maltase, metabolism of maltose may be via some nonhydrolytic pathway...|$|E
40|$|Replacement of {{mannitol}} with sucrose {{decreases the}} binding of [203 Hg]-p-chloromercuribenzenesulphonic acid (PCMBS) to Vicia faba leaf discs without epidermis. This decrease is optimal for 20 minutes on incubation, is concentration-dependent, {{and is also}} found with maltose and raffinose. In parallel experiments, the addition of sucrose, maltose, and raffinose during PCMBS pretreatment was shown to increase subsequent uptake of [U- 14 C]sucrose. In contrast, d- or l-glucose, 3 -O-methylglucose, galactose, fructose, palatinose, <b>turanose,</b> or melibiose had no effect either on PCMBS binding or on [14 C]sucrose uptake. The sucrose-induced decrease of PCMBS binding is retained after a cold and ionic shock. Measurements of specific activities of membrane fractions prepared from tissues incubated in labeled PCMBS show that the decrease concerns the 120, 000 gravity pellet, but that very mild procedures must be chosen to prevent redistribution of label in the supernatant. Altogether, the data provide new support to {{the hypothesis that the}} active site of the sucrose carrier contains a group sensitive to PCMBS...|$|E
30|$|Sugars are {{the main}} storage form of photosynthetically fixed carbon in plants. Levels of monosaccharides such as {{fructose}} and mannose declined in RP-I tissues as compared to RP-UI. However, at 48 hai, fructose and glucose levels went up in infested tissues as compared to un-infested tissues. The phosphorylated derivatives of hexoses (galactose and glucose) showed enhanced accumulation in infested tissue as compared to un-infested {{and so did the}} transcripts encoding for hexokinases and galactokinases. The levels of disaccharide sucrose and <b>turanose</b> declined in infested tissues as compared to un-infested tissues (Additional file 5 : Table S 2). A corresponding up-regulation of the transcripts encoding invertases, a class of enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of sucrose to constituting monosaccharides, was observed. Trehalose, another disaccharide, showed elevated levels which was reflected in down-regulation of transcripts involved in trehalose metabolism. The levels of sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, arabinitol and myo-inositol decreased in host tissues upon gall midge challenge which is in line with the up-regulation of transcripts involved in minor CHO metabolism (Fig.  1, Additional file 6 : Table S 3).|$|E
40|$|A yellow-pigmented, Gram-negative, {{rod-shaped}} bacterium (strain CC-YY 255 (T)) {{was isolated}} from compost generated from food waste collected from Kinmen County, Taiwan. 16 S rRNA gene sequence {{analysis indicated that}} the strain formed a monophyletic branch at {{the periphery of the}} evolutionary radiation occupied by the genus Luteimonas; its closest neighbour was the type strain of Luteimonas mephitis (94. 4 % sequence similarity). The isolate was distinguished from Luteimonas mephitis on the basis of several phenotypic properties. The organism utilized glucose, maltose, gentiobiose, melibiose and <b>turanose</b> and only a few organic acids (acetate, propionate) and amino acids (L-alanyl glycine, glycyl L-aspartic acid and glycl L-glutamic acid) as substrates. The fatty acid profile was slightly different from that reported for Luteimonas mephitis. It is evident from the genotypic, chemotaxonomic and physiological data presented that strain CC-YY 255 (T) represents a novel species of the genus Luteimonas, for which the name Luteimonas composti sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CC-YY 255 (T) (= CCUG 53595 (T) = CIP 109311 (T) BCRC 17598 (T)) ...|$|E
