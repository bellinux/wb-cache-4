500|$|The Blue Jays drafted Loup in {{the ninth}} round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft. Loup had shown a strong {{performance}} when he was playing for the Tulane Green Wave and was the second Green Wave player to be drafted. Loup said of the event, [...] "I had 20 people text message me before I even heard anything and then my phone rang and I got the call. It's exciting. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> would call {{me as soon as}} the draft was over and we would discuss details, so hopefully everything will shake out." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the final}} cut privilege, Spielberg was {{dissatisfied}} with the film. Columbia Pictures was experiencing financial problems, and they were depending on this film to save their company. [...] "I wanted to have another six months to finish off this film, and release it in summer 1978. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> needed this film out immediately," [...] Spielberg explained. [...] "Anyway, Close Encounters was a huge financial success and I told them I wanted {{to make my own}} director's cut. They agreed on the condition that I show the inside of the mothership so they could have something to hang a [...] campaign on. I never should have shown the inside of the mother ship." [...] In 1979, Columbia gave Spielberg $1.5million to produce what became the [...] "Special Edition" [...] of the film. Spielberg added seven minutes of new footage, but also deleted or shortened various existing scenes by a total of ten minutes, so that the Special Edition was three minutes shorter than the original 1977 release. The Special Edition featured several new character development scenes, the discovery of the SS Cotopaxi in the Gobi Desert, and a view of the inside of the mothership. Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Special Edition was released in August 1980, making a further $15.7million, accumulating a final $303.7million box office gross. Roger Ebert [...] "thought the original film was an astonishing achievement, capturing the feeling of awe and wonder we have when considering the likelihood of life beyond the Earth. ... This new version ... is, quite simply, a better film ... Why didn't Spielberg make it this good the first time?" ...|$|E
2500|$|A man landed near my {{subterranean}} home. Behind {{him another}} man landed {{to his right}} [...] Then a third [...] landed nearby. The three sat over something {{that appeared to be}} a cloud. They spoke to me. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> came from far away, that they were coming for me, and they would take me to an old ancient regime.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm sorry, and I warn't expecting it. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to. <b>They</b> all <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to. <b>They</b> all said, kiss her; {{and said}} she'd like it. They all said it--every one of them. But I'm sorry, m'am, and I won't do {{it no more}} --I won't, honest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; all carried clubs. And <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>they</b> {{had been}} {{especially}} ordered {{not to take}} knives, and had indeed been searched before they came out." ...|$|R
2500|$|Verna is the matriarch of the Sawyer family. According to Taylor, [...] "What {{attracted}} me to Leatherface {{was really}} {{talking with the}} directors. When <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> {{wanted to do something}} that was a cross between Terrence Malick, like Badlands, and The Virgin Suicides, I thought 'I'm there' because what I love is this stuff that's happening with people pushing a genre as far as they could push it and it's exciting to me." [...] Taylor chose to concentrate more on Verna's maternal instincts for her family than her murderous ways, with the character having a denial or compartmentalization about her motherhood and the murder. The film reunites Taylor with Stephen Dorff, who both starred in the 1996 film I Shot Andy Warhol.|$|E
2500|$|Following her {{departure}} from EastEnders, Johnson was more candid in her reasons for leaving: [...] "I've {{had a great}} time but {{it got to the point}} where I was sat in bed at night thinking: 'Tomorrow will my character be crying, getting drunk or having an argument?'. It soon became physically exhausting and draining [...] I don't think the producers were very happy when I said I wanted to leave. I was still very new and they had just set up the new Watts dynasty but no-one could have made me change my mind. When I said to the producers I wanted to go <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> might have to recast Vicki. I don't mind. Life goes on and EastEnders goes on. I wouldn't want to go back at the moment - but never say never." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "There was a {{guy named}} Dan Jones who was then about 60years old, who was a wino {{who lived in a}} fleabag in the bad part of town. Jones was well known to rescue. In June of '69 they got a call—man down—it was Jones. They put the paddles on him, he was in VF, started CPR, zapped him, he came back to sinus rhythm, brought him into ER and three days later he was out and walking around. In gratitude, about a week later, he came down to Station 1, which he had never done before, and he {{said he would like to}} talk to the man who saved his life. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> had never seen Dan Jones in a clean shirt and sober, both of which he was that day. He would {{periodically}} come to the fire house and just say hello and he seemed to be sober. In my talks in those days I said this was the new cure for alcoholism. That was our first true save." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It was {{ten feet}} from the ground,' said Mary Alda, impressively, 'and they had lost their way; but <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> who <b>they</b> were. I'm come down with my father to see the place.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Then I {{went to the}} heath and the wild, [...] To the thistles and thorns of the waste; [...] And <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how <b>they</b> were beguiled, [...] Driven out, and {{compelled}} to the chaste.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I almost {{thought it}} must be a mistake when <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> seeing <b>they</b> are so unequally matched, but they all say so, so in course it's true--the other was Mitcham, the bugler of No. 3 Company." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{character}} received media criticism {{due to her}} American accent {{upon her}} reintroduction in 2003. Johnson said, [...] "I knew that would happen because I'm the only character who speaks differently. I haven't taken any of that to heart." [...] However, when the accent was altered from American to British, this received criticism too with Ian Hyland from the Daily Mirror describing it as [...] "hilarious" [...] and branding the character [...] "Go Away Again Vicki". [...] He added, [...] "Presumably the producers decided the reason viewers found her so annoying was her whiny American voice. Try again, guys." [...] Upon her departure in 2004, Johnson was also critical about her character's alternating accent: [...] "When I took the job they weren't sure what accent they wanted Vicki to have and about a week before they told me it should be American. I did that {{for a few months}} and then one day out of the blue I arrived on set and <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> wanted me to change to Cockney. It was the producer's decision. I was as stunned as everyone else - all the criticism was perfectly justified. It's probably the most stupid decision they could have made. People assumed I was slipping out of the accent - but it was nothing to do with me. I've taken a lot of stick. But it doesn't bother me because I know the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{heard of}} them before, though <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> were quite well known. The lady asked me if I had been to Chicago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I did," [...] said he. [...] "It {{might have}} been the mince-pies. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> were temperance pies, but I don't believe it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'The {{two doctors}} saw it an hour ago,' the Emir went on, 'and they greatly fear for his life. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>they</b> could do nothing, but that, as you {{had seen the}} white hakim do {{wonderful}} things, {{you might be able}} to do something.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Terry {{later told}} police, [...] "They got {{everything}} they had, {{put it in}} the car and drove off, and <b>me</b> too, and <b>they</b> drove <b>me</b> back home. While we were driving <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>they</b> were Satan worshippers and they had to do it Peter Aston for the sacrifice." ...|$|R
2500|$|He {{also said}} [...] "the {{whole thing was}} about ... them setting their own minimum wage. <b>They</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> would waive their foreign aid in return for setting their own minimum wage." [...] His {{comments}} in the Congressional Record in 1997 do not mention a minimum wage and the CNMI receives no foreign aid.|$|R
6000|$|Thou impetuous Nah! I lingered by thine {{islands of}} nightingales, and I asked thy rushing waters why they {{disturbed}} {{the music of}} thy groves? <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> were hastening to the Rhine! ...|$|E
60|$|I met {{the ladies}} {{afterwards}} in Lausanne. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> had been condemned {{to a fine}} of forty francs apiece. They also {{explained to me that}} they had not the slightest intention of paying it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, there's no danger, Aunt Judy," [...] said Mr. Loudon, [...] "if {{you don't}} meddle with them. But I suppose you can't do that, if {{the boys are}} going to case them up, as <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> {{intended}} doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I got {{out these}} glasses--which I bought because <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>they</b> would be wanted here, {{to keep out}} the glare of the sun--and I came here, and spoke as proper as might be; and then, Mrs. O'Halloran, you burst out {{laughing}} in my face, and destroy the whole effect of these spectacles, and all.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{were two}} {{here when you}} first came in sight, but they left at once on account of some business, as I understood. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>they</b> wanted to buy my wood-lot, and when I said that I had already sold it, they offered to show good signs of oil {{if they could be}} paid for the {{prospecting}} they had done." ...|$|R
25|$|Six of the escapees {{were there}} and we talked for about three hours with me trying to persuade them to come back. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>they</b> had {{sent a letter to}} the Minister of Justice Bakoa Kaltongga, {{complaining}} that they had been at ‘Container City’ since June in very confined areas, not allowed visitation rights and had no chance to see their chiefs for rehabilitation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's {{what they}} told me," [...] {{answered}} the man doggedly. [...] "They hired the car first without telling me what sort of a job it was. Then <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> wouldn't give me a cent if I didn't do what I was told to do. I'm a poor man, and----" ...|$|E
6000|$|Even so have I seen young {{priests of}} the prelatical Establishment aim at {{popularity}} by playing cricket with liberal coal-miners of sectarian persuasions. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> were [...] "in the mission field," [...] and one observed that his favourite {{post in the}} field was third man. I know not what he meant. But {{to return to the}} island.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "you don't seem cheered up much by word from your friends. I {{was too busy}} looking at them to rightly catch {{everything}} they said, but I know <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> were going to London in the Glanford. This I remembered, because it struck me what a jolly piece of good luck it all was for Captain Guy." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>they</b> {{had been}} refused {{medical care and}} had other {{requests}} unanswered and that other high risk prisoners had been moved out of container city to other prisons but not them and they felt it was unfair. They {{said that they were}} not allowed to exercise and were demanding to be relocated to another prison and that was the reason behind their escape." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He didn't," [...] cried Davy indignantly. [...] "I {{just thought}} it out for myself. And I've thought of {{something}} else. I'm not going to Sunday School or church at all. I'm going up {{to play with the}} Cottons. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> yesterday <b>they</b> weren't going to Sunday School today, 'cause their mother was away and there was nobody to make them. Come along, Dora, we'll have a great time." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>they</b> had {{followed}} <b>me</b> inshore when I had not {{returned from the}} hunt, that they had met {{the men of the}} elephant country, and had had a short and one-sided battle with the fellows. And that afterward they had returned to the launch with a prisoner, from whom they had learned that I had probably been captured by the men of the lion country.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Three or four {{of these}} vessels called at Mota while I was there. On one day three were in sight. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> were shot at at Whitsuntide, Sta. Maria, Vanua Lava, &c. And, indeed, I am obliged to be very careful, more so than at any time; and here, in the North Hebrides, I never know what may happen, though of course in many places they know me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] {{answered}} Pauline; [...] "I {{was made}} queen {{for the purpose}} of ruling. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> had confidence in my judgment, not in my readiness to carry out their wishes. If my judgment, coupled with that of my advisers, does not suit them, it is open to them to unmake me as they made me, and appoint a king or a president, but my judgment I cannot alter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur Raphael and {{his sister}} came down in the train with us," [...] said Mrs. Giles to Lothair; [...] "the rest of the troupe will not be here until to-morrow; but <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> {{could give you a}} perfect proverbe if your lordship would like it; and the Spanish conjuror is here; but I rather think, from what I gather, that the young ladies would like a dance." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{were equally}} surprised, though on another account. <b>They</b> all <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> were neighbors; {{that they had}} heard any one might take them; that they were nobody's goods; and the like. I talked big to them at first; {{went back to the}} gate and took out the key, so that they were all my prisoners; {{threatened}} to lock them all into the warehouse, and go and fetch my lord mayor's officers for them.|$|R
6000|$|... "After that I only {{remember}} that Constance was kneeling before him, calling out so pitifully, 'Oh, Merton, my darling, what is it? Merton, Merton, speak to me--speak to me--one word, only one word!' Then I fainted. When I recovered my senses I {{was lying on}} a sofa in the house, {{with some of them}} round <b>me</b> doing what <b>they</b> could for me; and <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>they</b> had sent for a doctor, and that Merton was dead.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, she was dead. Women {{work hard}} in these parts. She worked herself to death <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> and, as <b>they</b> said so then, the fire {{has gone on}} {{saying the same thing}} ever since. I suppose it was true. I have always {{believed}} it.' ...|$|R
