30|$|Half-wavelength AC Transmission (HWACT) {{can improve}} {{capability}} of AC transmission significantly. According {{to the basic}} principle of HWACT, the electromagnetic transient model of HWACT is built to analyze the fault transient process of transmission line. Based on fault characteristics of HWACT, the adaptability of traditional protections for transmission lines is analyzed briefly, such as current differential protection, distance protection and over current protection. In order {{to solve the problems}} of conventional protection caused by HWACT, a novel integrated protection based on multi-frequency domain information is proposed in this paper, which uses both the power frequency information and transient information. The integrated protection based on multi-frequency domain information takes advantages of power frequency and <b>transient</b> <b>protections,</b> which can not only improve the performance of traditional protection of AC transmission line but also realize fast fault judgment by <b>transient</b> travelling wave <b>protection.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{advantage}} of the rotary converter over the discrete motor-generator set is that the rotary converter avoids converting all of the power flow into mechanical energy and then back into electrical energy; some of the electrical energy instead flows directly from input to output, allowing the rotary converter to be much smaller and lighter than a motor-generator set of an equivalent power-handling capability. The advantages of a motor-generator set include adjustable voltage regulation which can compensate for voltage drop in the supply network; it also provided complete power isolation, harmonics isolation, greater surge and <b>transient</b> <b>protection,</b> and sag (brownout) protection through increased momentum.|$|E

The potential for using them as the primary transducer for monitoring high frequency currents {{as well as the}} power system frequency components provides the basis for extensive research into the use of <b>transient</b> based <b>protection</b> using current signals. This investigation has examined the response of a representative sample of 50 Hz distribution system {{current transformers}} to signals in the range of 1 kHz to 100 kHz.

The performances of a variety of current transformers of different types are examined. These included standard distribution system CTs, class X CTs and earth fault passage indicator CTs.

40|$|Supplemental {{restraint}} systems (SRS) developed for modern automotive vehicles rely heavily upon microelectronic control circuits; that act within fractions of a second, to coordinate and synchronize the activation, firing and subsequent deployment of airbag safety devices. However, within these vehicles, the relatively harsh electrical environment that exists can often contain multiple sources of transient electrical phenomena, which can {{give rise to}} false and potentially fatal activation of the aforementioned safety devices. The need for effective and reliable yet inexpensive built-in microelectronic based <b>transient</b> <b>protection</b> against such occurrences therefore remains key. Historically, automotive microelectronic based <b>transient</b> <b>protection</b> schemes have largely been based upon a technique known as „level-triggered transient protection‟ (LTTP). More recently, the work of Cahill et al. has managed to improve upon the aforementioned approach through use of a technique known as „level-triggered timed shut-off transient protection‟ (LTSOTP). However, from an industrial perspective, all of the advancements reported have remained somewhat unattractive; predominately due to manufacturing complexity, reliability and cost associated issues. In this work, a novel BiCMOS based monolithic HTSOTP device design is proposed that combines the advantages LTTP and LTSOTP, while capable of being „programmed‟ at manufacture to afford <b>transient</b> <b>protection</b> across {{the entire range of}} automotive system and sub-system voltage specifications currently in use. Finite element static and dynamic solid-state simulations were used to develop theory of operation for the HTSOTP design proposed and a discrete prototype was assembled and tested to further demonstrate proof of concept. Process simulations were then employed to investigate the constraints and potential issues associated with the realisation of a single monolithic implementation of the aforementioned design. In conclusion, significant advancements in the field of ‘flexible <b>transient</b> <b>protection</b> technologies for low voltage microelectronic switching applications’ have been reported...|$|E

30|$|In the 1960 ’s, {{people started}} to develop {{protection}} using the fault generated transient wave front, which marked the start of using fault <b>transients</b> for <b>protection.</b> Due to the limitation of the available technical means and the complexity in identifying the reflections of the wave front from the fault point, the prototype relays developed at that time do not offer today’s desired reliability and speed.

Through the examination and analysis of these characteristics, new protection principles can be developed to solve the problems which can not be resolved by power frequency based protection principles.

40|$|Abstract—Whether a {{disturbance}} will trigger unexpected protection operation to exacerbate the normal operation state or even {{lead to the}} unstable state depends on the transient energy that the system gains during the fault period. The paper presents a new gradient projection approach to calculate the critical energy for transient stability assessment of the power system with the protection operation. The method takes the projection of the potential energy gradient on the key protection operation surface as search direction and iteratively searches for the critical energy at the surface; in order to let the optimal point be the feasible point, the generator angles are considered as control variables of power flow equation to solve network bus voltage and angle during the searching process.

This transfer of IgA from mother to infant provides <b>transient</b> immune <b>protection</b> against a variety of gastrointestinal pathogens. Here we show that the mucosal epithelial chemokine CCL 28 is up-regulated in the mammary gland during lactation and that IgA ASCs from this tissue express CCR 10 and migrate to CCL 28.
