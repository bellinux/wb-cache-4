5|$|Dynasty Warriors 4 expands on its {{predecessors}} by adding new characters, new modes {{of play and}} a completely new 'Edit Mode.' Instead of having strict routines to follow during battle, officers, to some extent, will have a greater reaction to the events taking place on the battlefield {{in the game and}} may react to <b>things</b> <b>more</b> often.|$|E
5|$|For the 1980 Grand Prix season, the Yamaha factory {{made the}} Yamaha USA team of Roberts and Carruthers {{the de facto}} factory racing team. The season got {{underway}} two months late due to cancellation of Austrian and Venezuelan rounds. Barry Sheene {{had been replaced by}} Randy Mamola as the top Suzuki rider as, Sheene had been dissatisfied with the Suzuki's efforts and had turned to a privateer Yamaha team. Roberts won the first three races as the Suzuki team appeared to be in disarray, but by the third race, the Suzukis of Mamola and Marco Lucchinelli were making <b>things</b> <b>more</b> difficult for Roberts. Roberts' Yamaha suffered a deflating front tire and a faulty rear shock absorber in the Netherlands forcing him {{to pull out of the}} race, but his main championship rivals also suffered setbacks with Cecotto, Ferrari and Hartog all missing races due to injuries and Sheene suffering mechanical breakdowns. Suzuki riders went on to win the last four races, but Roberts had built up a sufficient point lead to hold on and clinch his third consecutive 500cc world championship.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the {{researchers}} Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones explored Casler's first explanation, arguing {{that people have}} a basic desire {{to feel good about}} themselves and behave according to that desire. These automatic positive associations would influence feelings about almost anything associated with the self. Given the mere ownership effect, which states that people like <b>things</b> <b>more</b> if they own them, {{the researchers}} theorised that people would develop an affection for objects and concepts that are associated with the self, such as their name. They called this unconscious power implicit egotism. Uri Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices. Low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity would show an effect. Raymond Smeets theorised that if implicit egotism stems from a positive evaluation of the self, then people with low self-esteem would not gravitate towards choices associated with the self, but possibly away from them. A lab experiment confirmed this.|$|E

5|$|The four Borodino-class battlecruisers (also {{referred}} to as Izmail class) of the Imperial Russian Navy were all laid down in December 1912 at Saint Petersburg for service with the Baltic Fleet. Construction of the ships was delayed as many domestic factories were already overloaded with orders and some components had to be ordered from abroad. The start of World War I slowed their construction still further as the foreign orders were often not delivered and domestic production was diverted into <b>things</b> <b>more</b> immediately useful for the war effort. The ships were launched in 1915â€“16, but {{the outbreak of the}} Russian Revolution in 1917 put a stop to their construction, which never resumed. The Soviet Navy gave consideration to completing the ships; initially, Izmail and Borodino were looked at, with a view to finishing one or both to their original design, but the lack of available 12in guns, combined with the complexity of the originally designed electrical system, led to the idea being dropped. Subsequently, plans were raised to complete Kinburn and Navarin to a modified design with 16in guns, which again failed due to the difficulty in either obtaining guns from overseas, or manufacturing them domestically. Subsequent ideas included converting some of the hulls for cargo or passenger use, which again failed. The Navy made a serious proposal in 1925 to convert Izmail, the ship closest to completion, to an aircraft carrier, but this plan was later cancelled as a result of political maneuvering {{on the part of the}} Red Army. Eventually, all four hulls were broken up for scrap; the second, third and fourth were sold to a German company in 1923, while Izmail was broken up in Leningrad in 1931.|$|E

25|$|Puzzles became greatly fashionable as well. In 1893, the English lawyer , writing {{under the}} {{pseudonym}} of Professor Hoffman, {{wrote a book}} called Puzzles Old and New. It contained, amongst other <b>things,</b> <b>more</b> than 40 descriptions of puzzles with secret opening mechanisms. This book grew into a reference work for puzzle games and was very popular at the time. The Tangram puzzle, originally from China, spread to Europe and America in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Concern grew {{about the}} {{disproportionate number of}} lunatics in Middlesex. The local {{judiciary}} (before whom the lunatics would have appeared charged with various offences or running amok) decided on 15 November 1827 to exercise their powers and build an asylum. In the following year Parliament recognised the barriers to asylum building (mostly financial) and passed the 1828 Metropolitan Commissioners in Lunacy Act to ensure the 1808 Acts was enforced. It gave JPs the powers to progress <b>things</b> <b>more</b> rapidly.|$|E

After he finishes the relationship, a heartbroken Sam looks for comfort elsewhere. She turns to local club owner Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), but he is only using her to make Melanie Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite) jealous, so a hurt Sam decides to leave Walford once again in 2000.|$|E

25|$|Note that {{up until}} now much of the above {{paragraph}} could apply to octopuses, mollusks, worms, insects and <b>things</b> <b>more</b> primitive; anything with a more concentrated nervous system and better eyes than say a jellyfish. However, the following applies to mammals generally and birds (in modified form): The retina in these more complex animals sends fibers (the optic nerve) to the lateral geniculate nucleus, to the primary and secondary visual cortex of the brain. Signals from the retina can also travel directly from the retina to the superior colliculus.|$|E
25|$|Over time, HRT {{operators}} {{studied with}} US military, local, federal, and international tactical teams, and attended private courses {{to learn more}} about air assault tactics, rappelling, close quarters combat, chemical agents, terrorist psychology, surveillance methods, sniping/counter-sniping, communications and more. Tactics learned during training were shared with the team. Eventually, for close quarter battle training, the HRT decided to make <b>things</b> <b>more</b> realistic on advice from SEAL Team Six (later known as United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group or DEVGRU) commander Richard Marcinko, and the HRT introduced blood bags and wax bullets. The wax bullets were used for team-versus-team drills.|$|E
25|$|Singer's {{ideas have}} contributed to the rise of {{effective}} altruism. He argues that people should not only try to reduce suffering, but reduce it in the most effective manner possible. While Singer has previously written at length about the moral imperative to reduce poverty and eliminate the suffering of nonhuman animals, particularly in the meat industry, he writes about how the effective altruism movement is doing these <b>things</b> <b>more</b> effectively in his 2015 book, The Most Good You Can Do. He is a board member of Animal Charity Evaluators, a charity evaluator used by many members of the effective altruism community which recommends the most cost-effective animal advocacy charities and interventions.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, {{after the}} fall of the Eastern Bloc, the former East Germany became part of the Communities as part of a reunified Germany. A close fiscal {{integration}} with the introduction of the euro was not matched by institutional oversight making <b>things</b> <b>more</b> troubling. Attempts to solve the problems and to make the EU more efficient and coherent had limited success.With further enlargement planned to include the former communist states of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus and Malta, the Copenhagen criteria for candidate members to join the EU were agreed upon in June 1993. The expansion of the EU introduced a new level of complexity and discord.|$|E
25|$|In {{the best}} book on asthma of the 19th century, first {{published}} in 1860, the British physician and physiologist Henry Hyde Salter (1823â€“1871) included a chapter on treatment â€³by stimulantsâ€³. Strong coffee was very helpful, presumably because it dispelled sleep, which favoured asthma. Even more impressive, however, was the response to â€³strong mental emotionâ€³: â€³The cure of asthma by violent emotion is more sudden and complete than by any other remedy whatever; indeed, I know few <b>things</b> <b>more</b> striking and curious in {{the whole history of}} therapeutics. â€¦ The cure â€¦ takes no time; it is instantaneous, the intensest paroxysm ceases on the instant.â€³ â€³Cureâ€³ due to release of adrenaline from the adrenals is the retrospective interpretation.|$|E
25|$|After this, Elves and Dwarfs flourished {{and created}} mighty empires, but {{eventually}} {{they were set}} into a slow decline. A series of civil wars amongst the Elves split them into two groups - the malicious Dark Elves and righteous High Elves. A petty war between the High Elves and Dwarfs served only to diminish both races and caused the High Elves to abandon their colonies. Some of the colonists refused {{to leave their homes}} in a magical sapient forest and over time developed into the enigmatic and isolationist Wood Elves. A period of seismic activity caused by the Slann decimated the underground holds of the Dwarfs while attacks by Skaven and Goblins, who breached the Dwarf strongholds from below, only made <b>things</b> <b>more</b> desperate.|$|E

25|$|Plantations stayed off the {{political}} agenda until the appointment of Thomas Wentworth, a Privy Councilor of Charles I, {{to the position of}} Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1632. Wentworth's job was to raise revenue for Charles and to cement Royal control over Ireland â€“ which meant, among other <b>things,</b> <b>more</b> plantations, both to raise money and to break {{the political}} power of the Irish Catholic gentry. Wentworth confiscated land in Wicklow and planned a full-scale Plantation of Connacht â€” where all Catholic landowners would lose between a half and a quarter of their estates. The local juries were intimidated into accepting Wentworth's settlement; when a group of Connacht landowners complained to Charles I, Wentworth had them imprisoned. However, settlement proceeded only in County Sligo and County Roscommon.|$|E
25|$|Two boys, Kevin and Tommy, {{have become}} {{convinced}} (mostly Kevin) {{that the two}} barbers who run the unpopular and obscure old barbershop in town are actually vampires. Despite failing most vampire tests (such as disliking garlic, crossing running water, crosses etc.) the two break into the barbershop's basement. They are captured and the truth revealed: neither barber is a vampire. Rather, they harvest blood for their resident vampire; vampires have changed over the centuries into gigantic <b>things</b> <b>more</b> akin to 1000-pound leeches than anything that could pass for a human. They bargained with the barber guild: if the guild would hide and feed them, then the barbers {{would be allowed to}} harvest a sort of purified blood which grants partial immortality to humans. The two are forcibly inducted into this grim fraternity.|$|E
