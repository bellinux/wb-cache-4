50|$|Nyquist's famous 1928 {{paper was}} a study on how many pulses (code elements) could be {{transmitted}} per second, and recovered, through a channel of limited bandwidth. Signaling at the Nyquist rate meant putting as many code pulses through a <b>telegraph</b> <b>channel</b> as its bandwidth would allow. Shannon used Nyquist's approach when he proved the sampling theorem in 1948, but Nyquist did not work on sampling per se.|$|E
5000|$|His early {{theoretical}} work on {{determining the}} bandwidth requirements for transmitting information laid {{the foundations for}} later advances by Claude Shannon, {{which led to the}} development of information theory. In particular, Nyquist determined that the number of independent pulses that could be put through a <b>telegraph</b> <b>channel</b> per unit time is limited to twice the bandwidth of the channel, and published his results in the papers Certain factors affecting telegraph speed (1924) and Certain topics in Telegraph Transmission Theory (1928). [...] This rule is essentially a dual of what is now known as the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem.|$|E
50|$|The Model 28 Tape Readers, {{also known}} as a transmitter-distributors, are transmitting-only five, six, seven or eight level devices that {{automatically}} converts chadless or fully perforated paper tape into electrical impulses. These devices are self-contained and motor-driven and operate at speeds up to 200 words-per-minute. In some equipment, these electrical signals are transmitted sequentially over a single <b>telegraph</b> <b>channel</b> to local or remote receiving stations. In other cases, the tape readers will provide output on a parallel-wire basis. The Model 28 family of tape readers includes the fixed head single contact transmitter-distributor (LXD), pivoted head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LAXD), fixed head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LBXD), pivoted and fixed head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LCXD) and tape reader parallel-wire transmitter (LX).|$|E

40|$|Abstract-A {{new class}} of {{constrained}} systems: average runlength constraints (ARC) are defined. These systems are defined by requiring that the sum of n consecutive runlengths be bounded above by a linear function of n. In particular, the running average runlength of every sequence in the system is bounded above by a constant. A general result is given on the capacity of ARC systems. The state splitting algorithm is then improved for variable-length graphs. This is then applied to obtain high, fixed-rate codes from the free binary source to ARC systems. As an example, a rate 1 / 2, (d, k) =(2, 7) code is constructed that has a smaller average runlength than the industry standard (2, 7) code. - Index Tenns-Magnetic recording, runlength-limited codes, state-splitting. the RLL constraints, can be represented more compactly if one utilizes a variable-length graph (VLG), where the edge labels in the FSTD may have different lengths, as in Shannon’s original description of the <b>telegraph</b> <b>channel.</b> The state-splitting technique, central to the algorithm in [2], was extended by Adler, Friedman, Kitchens, and Marcus [7] to constraints described by a VLG. This generalized approach proved {{to be most effective}} in the construction of fixed-rate (1 : 1) codes from Nary data to the constrained system; the application to the construction of codes with arbitrary rate (p: q) often requires representing the constrained sequences {{in a way that is}} not consistent with the original variable-length structure. In this paper, we develop an improved variable-length state-splitting algorithm that permits the design of rate (p: q) codes more directly from the original VLG representation of the constraint. The modified algorithm is I...|$|E
40|$|Optimal (minimum cost) binary prefix {{codes for}} {{infinite}} sources with geometrically distributed frequencies, e. g., P = {pi(1 - p) }i= 0 ∞<, 0 < p < 1, were first (implicitly) suggested by Golomb {{over thirty years}} ago in the context of run-length encodings. Ten years later Gallager and Van Voorhis exhibited such optimal codes for all values of p. Just recently Merhav, Seroussi and Weinberger extended this further to find optimal binary prefix codes for two-sided geometric distributions. These codes were derived by cleverly "guessing" optimal codes for finite sources, validating these guesses by using the sibling property of Huffman encoding, and then showing that the finite codes converge in a very specific sense to an optimal infinite one. In this thesis we describe the first algorithmic approach to constructing optimal prefix infinite codes. Our approach is to define an infinite weighted graph with the property that the least cost infinite path in the graph corresponds to the optimal code. We then show that even though the graph is infinite, the least-cost infinite path has a repetitive structure and that it is therefore possible to not only find this path but to find it relatively efficiently. This approach will work for even more complicated generalizations of geometric sources where solutions cannot be guessed as well as in extensions of Huffman-coding for which the Huffman algorithm no longer works, e. g., non-uniform cost encoding alphabet characters and/or other restrictions on the codewords. We illustrate our approach by deriving an algorithm for constructing optimal prefix free codes with a geometric source for the <b>telegraph</b> <b>channel.</b> We also implement our algorithm and show what the constructed codes look like in this case...|$|E

5000|$|Although Morse code preceded modern coded {{modulation}} techniques by {{more than}} a century, in terms of Claude Shannon's modern Information Theory, Morse code may be regarded essentially as an encoded method of signaling that simultaneously comprises both: a source code (data compression code) and a channel code (modulation code). The Morse code source code was created by Samuel Morse's assistant Alfred Vail when Vail assigned the shortest Morse code symbols to the most often occurring (English language) source symbols (alpha-numeric characters and punctuation marks), in the style of today's modern data compression codes such as the modern Information Theory based: Huffman, Arithmetic, and Lempel-Ziv-Welsh codes. Morse code symbols are variable length sequences of: dot signals, dash signals, and dot duration silent periods. Vail based his Morse code on the English language source with the shortest Morse symbol, a sequence composed of a single Morse code dot followed by a single dot duration silent period, encoding the most often used English letter [...] "E" [...] with corresponding longer sequences used for less common English letters. Besides assigning Morse code symbols to alpha-numeric and punctuation characters of the information source language symbols the early creators of Morse code also assigned additional procedural symbols to the Morse code related to page formatting of documents and to control and turn over of <b>telegraph</b> communication <b>channels.</b>|$|R
