25|$|On November 6, 2017, Canada Post {{issued a}} stamp commemorating the devastating {{explosion}} that rocked Halifax {{on the morning}} of December 6, 1917, when two ships – one loaded with explosives – collided in the narrows leading to its harbour. Released one month before the 100th anniversary of <b>that</b> <b>fateful</b> day, the issue also salutes the resilience of the Haligonians who rebuilt their city from the ashes.|$|E
25|$|Father and son {{repeatedly}} clash {{over the}} unwritten rules of social class, and this culminates when Tommy marries his sweetheart Meg (Ophelia Lovibond), {{a woman of}} lower standing with a shameful secret in her past.

Following the results of <b>that</b> <b>fateful</b> choice, Old Tom takes on a personal mission that carries him through the final decades of his life: that of honouring his son Tommy.|$|E
25|$|Guests enter {{one of two}} rooms, {{either his}} office or the library, and in each room a large stained glass window depicts a {{confident}} Hightower with Shiriki Utundu sitting on a pedestal nearby. A tour guide talks about Hightower, then winds up an old gramophone that plays a recording of Hightower's last interview. At this point, the lights dim. Suddenly, the stained glass window changes to show a frightened Hightower holding the idol and then entering the elevator on <b>that</b> <b>fateful</b> night. It then shows {{the outside of the}} hotel as the elevator ascends. Suddenly, all the lights in the hotel go out, and there is a flash of green lightning, shattering the bottom of the window. At this point, Shiriki Utundu comes to life, looks around, laughs mischievously at the guests, and then vanishes into a star-field. A gray fog covers the window, which remains the same when the fog lifts. Guests are then ushered into an enormous storage room where Hightower kept his treasures. There are multiple loading rooms on the second floor, each themed to a different type of item. One has swords, another has tapestries, the third has stone tablets and other valuable artifacts.|$|E

50|$|Shelden {{has noted}} <b>that</b> Guelzo's <b>Fateful</b> Lightning: A New History of the Civil War and Reconstruction (2012) is heavily focused on Lincoln. She {{complains}} that {{little in the}} book is new, and much is based on old fashioned historiography. She says he underplays the recent scholarship on the home front, environmental concerns, and medical issues, while giving only cursory attention to the black experience or to the complexities of Reconstruction.|$|R
60|$|As he had {{not been}} present when Bradley arrived, he did not know <b>that</b> this <b>fateful</b> object had been brought home by his host, who, after {{receiving}} it from Richelieu, had put it in his pocket to illustrate his story of the discovery. On the contrary, it seemed that Louise's careless exposure of his foolish stratagem was gratuitously and purposely cruel. Nevertheless, he stopped and looked at her.|$|R
500|$|Hannibal had {{defeated}} {{the equivalent of}} eight consular armies (16 legions plus {{an equal number of}} allies). Within just three campaign seasons (20 months), Rome had lost one-fifth (150,000) of the entire population of male citizens over 17 years of age. Furthermore, the morale effect of this victory was such that most of southern Italy joined Hannibal's cause. After Cannae, the Hellenistic southern provinces of Arpi, Salapia, Herdonia, Uzentum, including the cities of Capua and Tarentum (two of the largest city-states in Italy) revoked their allegiance to Rome and pledged their loyalty to Hannibal. As Livy noted, [...] "How much more serious was the defeat of Cannae than those which preceded it, can be seen by the behavior of Rome's allies; before <b>that</b> <b>fateful</b> day, their loyalty remained unshaken, now it began to waver {{for the simple reason that}} they despaired of Roman power." [...] In the same year the Greek cities in Sicily were induced to revolt against Roman political control, while the Macedonian king, Philip V, pledged his support to Hannibal, initiating the First Macedonian War against Rome. Hannibal also secured an alliance with the new King Hieronymus of Syracuse, the only independent left in Sicily.|$|E

2500|$|Critics say {{the absurdity}} of Plan 9 from Outer Space {{is found in the}} {{dialogue}} rather than on-screen action. Criswell's opening narration redundantly informs the viewer that [...] "future events such as these will affect you in the future", while referring to viewers as [...] "my friends" [...] four times in the same minute. Criswell also begins the narration by referring to future events, only to later describe them in the past tense ("...the full story of what happened on <b>that</b> <b>fateful</b> day"), and inexplicably calling for [...] "the guilty" [...] to be punished.|$|E
50|$|In his memoirs, Jovan Subotić {{recalled}} <b>that</b> the <b>fateful</b> {{events of}} 1848 propelled him irrevocably {{into the public}} life. He remembered the revolution in Vienna on March 13, which was soon followed by the revolution in Budapest on the 15th of the same month. The first demand addressed to the Parliament in Pest was the request for abolition of censorship. Subotić was among the petitioners and he subsequently lost the job that gave him 600 florins yearly.|$|R

2500|$|..... {{the night}} of 3 March 1971 will never be {{forgotten}} by the fans of Fluminense, who followed {{on radio and television}} the match against Deportivo Italia. More than 26,000 people went to the Maracana. The modest Venezuelan team, thrashed in their own field in the previous match, did what no none could do for over a year, not even the powerful Brazilian teams: defeat the Fluminense in their Maracana. <b>That</b> <b>fateful</b> night, Deportivo Italia achieved the victory more enjoyable in the Venezuelan national football history, winning in the largest stadium in the world the Champion of Brazil..|$|E
2500|$|Stead {{boarded the}} Titanic {{for a visit}} to the United States {{to take part in a}} peace {{congress}} at Carnegie Hall at the request of President Taft.

During the tour his role as specialist fielding coach was reduced to allow greater input into the team's batting performance. He was used extensively by both junior and senior players such as Inzamam-ul-Haq, Younis Khan, Mohammad Yousuf and Shahid Afridi as a one-to-one batting coach. He was in the Pakistan dressing room at The Oval on <b>that</b> <b>fateful</b> day in August 2006 when the infamous alleged [...] "Ball tampering" [...] incident occurred.|$|E

2500|$|The {{suspicion}} by {{the northern}} officers {{that there was}} some kind of collusion and understanding between the Nzeogwu group and General Aguiyi-Ironsi was further fuelled by the fact that Aguiyi-Ironsi himself was of Igbo ethnic stock. Interestingly 40 years after his murder Aguiyi-Ironsi's son, Thomas Aguiyi-Ironsi, was to become [...] Nigeria's Minister of Defence and ironically he took over that position from General Theophilus Danjuma, the man that had killed his father 40 years earlier. Many have said that the seeds of the northern officer's counter-coup of July 1966, which witnessed the killings of General Aguiyi-Ironsi and many other officers of mainly Igbo extraction and which eventually led to the [...] Nigerian civil war itself were planted on <b>that</b> <b>fateful</b> night of 15 January by the bloodletting of Major Nzeogwu and his men, most of whom were of Igbo extraction.|$|E

2500|$|Carinthia's eminent {{linguists}} Primus Lessiak and Eberhard Kranzmayer {{assumed that}} the city's name, which literally translates as [...] "ford of lament" [...] or [...] "ford of complaints", {{had something to do}} with the superstitious thought <b>that</b> <b>fateful</b> fairies or demons tend to live around treacherous waters or swamps. In Old Slovene, cviljovec is a place haunted by such a wailing female ghost or cvilya. [...] Thus they assumed that [...] Klagenfurt's name was a translation made by the German settlers of the original Slovene name of the neighbouring wetland. However, the earliest Slovene mention of Klagenfurt in the form of [...] "v Zelouzi" [...] ('in Celovec', the Slovene name for Klagenfurt) dating from 1615 is 400 years more recent and thus could be a translation from German. The latest interpretation, on the other hand, is that the Old Slovene cviljovec itself goes back to an Italic l'aquiliu meaning a place at or in the water, which would make the wailing-hag theory obsolete.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tragedy of}} [...] "The Great Stone Church" [...] {{gave rise to}} its best-loved legend, that of a young native girl named Magdalena {{who was killed in}} the collapse. Magdalena lived on the Mission grounds and {{had fallen in love with}} an artist named Teófilo. However, the pair was deemed too young to marry by their elders and were forced to carry on their {{relationship}} in secret. On <b>that</b> <b>fateful</b> December morning, the repentant Magdalena walked ahead of the procession of worshipers carrying a penitent's candle just as the earthquake struck. Teófilo rushed into the church as the walls and roof tumbled to the ground in a vain attempt to save his lover. When the rubble was cleared the pair was found among the dead, locked in a final embrace. It is said that on moonlit nights one can sometimes make out the face of a young girl, seemingly illuminated by candlelight, high up in the ruins. Other, less-pervasive legends include that of a faceless monk who haunted the corridors of the original quadrangle, and of a headless soldier who was often seen standing guard near the front entrance.|$|E

[...] During that same year, the Greek cities in Sicily were induced to revolt against Roman political control, while the Macedonian king, Philip V, pledged his support to Hannibal [...] thus initiating the First Macedonian War against Rome. Hannibal also secured an alliance with newly appointed King Hieronymus of Syracuse, and Tarentum also came over to him around that time. Hannibal now had the resources and personnel needed to launch a successful attack on the City of Rome. However, he was uncertain of the feasibility of such an attack and spent a great deal of time pondering it. While he hesitated, the Romans were able to regroup, and the opportunity was lost. The Romans looked back on Hannibal's indecision as what saved Rome from certain defeat. Hannibal sent a delegation to Rome to negotiate a peace and another one offering to release his Roman prisoners of war for ransom, but Rome rejected all offers.|$|E

5000|$|Anationalism {{was defined}} as follows in that manifesto: [...] "What characterizes anationalism is not {{primarily}} its acknowledgement of the huge role played by production of artifacts in the world. It is that capability that has made man the king of other living beings. Human beings adapt nature to their own needs, while animals must adapt to nature. Anationalists therefore do not deny the great strength that lies in the human will. They do not doubt that humans cannot shed their own weight or jump away from their own shadow. Nevertheless, the limited space in which man is free to act is relatively large. His will can thus engender great works. We therefore believe <b>that</b> the <b>fateful</b> laws of history are only relative." ...|$|R
