After completion of the crypt and the apse, still in Gothic style, {{the rest of the}} church is conceived in an organic style, imitating natural shapes with their abundance of ruled surfaces. He intended the interior to resemble a forest, with inclined columns like branching trees, helicoidal in form, creating a simple but sturdy structure. Gaudí applied all of his previous experimental findings in this project, from works such as the Park Güell and the crypt of the Colònia Güell, creating a church <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> structurally perfect, harmonious and aesthetically satisfying.|$|E

Copper and silver bond extremely well owing to their shared high electro-conductivity. Lining thickness varies widely by maker, but averages between 7–10 microns. The disadvantages of silver are expense and the tendency of sulfurous foods, especially brassicas, to discolor. Worn silver linings on copper cookware can be restored by stripping and re-electroplating.|$|E

25|$|After his retirement, Eamon Carr went on {{to become}} a {{producer}} of young rock talent in the mid-1980s, and also forming his own record label called Hotwire (which sponsored noted acts such as the punk rock group The Golden Horde). He also did a number of specialist DJ slots on radio before morphing into a music/sports journalist with the Evening Herald in Dublin. More recently he presented on a Dublin station 'Carr's Cocktail Shack' in which he played American music of the 1950s and 1960s. In 2008, Carr and Henry McCullough co-wrote a new bunch of songs. A resulting album entitled Poor Man's Moon was released on 1 September 2008. Also in 2008, Carr released his first book, The Origami Crow, Journey Into Japan, World Cup Summer 2002, a book <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> a travel log about his journey to Japan, a poetry collection, an homage to Japanese poet Basho, heralded by many as the creator of Haiku, and also has some sports commentary thrown in.|$|E

In the aftermath of his death, many of his unpublished writings—including letters, literary criticism and prose and poetry—were released.

Despite covering five decades and numerous settings, it still [...] "cohere into a satisfying tale {{of loss and}} redemption". He said [...] "It's an impressive feat of sustained narrative craftsmanship". Robert Wiersema wrote in the National Post {{that this is one}} of Irving's [...] "most rewarding and satisfying novels". He said he performs [...] "the most death-defying of literary feats: negotiat the delicate line between familiarity and novelty in such impressive style as to create a work <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> comfortable, vintage Irving yet wholly new and unique". Ron Charles in The Washington Post praised the opening section of the book and its [...] "vibrant" [...] Twisted River community, but was critical of the rest of the novel saying it is [...] "scrambled across many blurry cities and restaurants and different times in a way that deadens the novel's momentum". He said that as soon as Dominic and his son flee Twisted River, the story [...] "disintegrates in what must be the most disappointing wipeout of Irving's career". Charles was particularly critical of the fact that the book dwelt excessively on Danny's writing career, which mirrored Irving's, saying that it was [...] "shorthand for real storytelling, for creating colorful places full of well-developed characters".|$|E

Chris Williams of Billboard {{said the}} song is [...] "Max Martin and Spears at their best: a stomping dance floor beat with building synths prodding the song along and the singer sounding like she's having a blast being the bad girl". Rolling Stone writer Caryn Ganz called the song one of the standout tracks of the album. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian commented that her stronger and confident delivery in the chorus was noticeably lacking {{in the rest of}} the album. Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle also said that the [...] "more aggressive, pointed persona" [...] Spears adopts in {{the song is}} one of the high points of the album. The Emory Wheels writer Julia Cox called it [...] "the album's strongest and most unorthodox song". Ricardo Baca of The Denver Post named the song the most fascinating track of the album and commented on the euphemism, saying [...] "It's trashy and clever, and it's also quite fun. And fun is exactly what Spears should be aiming for". However, there were also some negative reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said the song is [...] "a Katy Perry-styled exercise in crass commercial carnality <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> the best and worst song here". Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "" [...] and added that [...] "it'll be a middle-school sensation". NME named it one of the filthiest songs of all time.|$|E

Two (of many) guffaw-worthy moments: Mulder's squeal and the smoking alien." [...] Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave the episode a rare A+ and wrote that the episode [...] "is {{one of the very}} finest episodes of television I've ever seen, but I'm not sure it's a terrific episode of The X-Files. [...] If The X-Files were a Lord of the Rings-length novel, then [...] "Jose Chung's" [...] would be its first appendix, a source <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> in love with the main text and critical of it, a place where real human concerns creep {{around the edges of the}} show's chilly implausibilities." [...] VanDerWerff's colleague Zack Handlen wrote that the episode was [...] "brilliant", but he did not feel it was as satisfying as he anticipated because it did not contribute to the series as a whole. Review website IGN named it the fourth best standalone X-Files episode of the entire series, writing, [...] "it was 'Jose Chung's From Outer Space in Season 3 that showed that X-Files could create a true comedy masterpiece that almost completely broke away from the show's usual format and tone."

OK, one more and then I'll be done: it's yummy." [...] Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Ratatouille never overwhelms, even though it's stocked with action, romance, historical content, family drama and serious statements about the creation of art." [...] Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "From the moment Remy enters, crashing, to the final happy fadeout, Ratatouille parades the brio and depth that set Pixar apart from and above other animation studios." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "A lot of animated movies have inspired sequels, notably Shrek, but Brad Bird's Ratatouille is the first one that made me positively desire one." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Had Bird gone the safe route, he would have robbed us of a great new cartoon figure in Remy, who {{like the rest of the}} film is rendered with animation <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> fanciful and life-like.

2500|$|Examining Pachypodium reveals {{characteristics}} of various organs that {{adapt to the}} microenvironment. These adaptations, variations on habit, trunks, branches, branchlets, spines, leaves, or flowers, are plentiful in demonstrating how Pachypodium as a genus fosters greater variation in its speciation. The manner in which speciation occurs in Pachypodium, therefore, is apparent: adaptive mechanisms on a morphological level respond to the microenvironment of Pachypodium habitat. The genus' unique organizational, architectural morphology shapes plants that are highly, adaptively responsive to their immediate, surrounding, microenvironments. The duplicity of an adaptive mechanism <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> [...] "strict" [...] and [...] "flexible" [...] at differing levels of plant physiology, or structure, has granted Pachypodium the ability to evolve within the landscape into variations that fulfill an ecological niche as various species.|$|E
