5|$|After the Olympics, Crapp and Fraser took a {{break from}} {{competitive}} swimming, while Leech retired. This allowed Morgan an opening, and she won both the junior and open sprint titles at the 1957 New South Wales Championships. She followed <b>this</b> <b>by</b> winning three individual titles at the Australian Championships in Canberra: the 110-, 220- and 440-yard freestyle, in times of 1 minute 7.8 seconds; 2 minutes 29.3 seconds; and 5 minutes 21.6 seconds, respectively. Her times were slower than her bests in 1956. She {{was part of the}} New South Wales team that won the 4×100-yard freestyle and medley relays, anchoring both quartets.|$|E

5|$|Another {{function}} of this coenzyme in cell signaling is as a precursor of cyclic ADP-ribose, which is produced from NAD by ADP-ribosyl cyclases, {{as part of}} a second messenger system. This molecule acts in calcium signaling by releasing calcium from intracellular stores. It does <b>this</b> <b>by</b> binding to and opening a class of calcium channels called ryanodine receptors, which are located in the membranes of organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
5|$|As Dean of Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Jonathan Swift {{spent every}} fifth Sunday preaching from the pulpit. Although {{many of his}} friends {{suggested}} that he should publish these sermons, Swift felt that he lacked the talent as a preacher to make his sermons worthy of publication. Instead, Swift spent his time working more on political works, such as Drapier's Letters, and justified <b>this</b> <b>by</b> his lacking in religions areas.|$|E
5|$|At {{a session}} of the Arab League's Joint Defence Council on January 27–30, 1973, Egypt {{presented}} a report stressing that an attack against Israel {{would have to be}} carried out simultaneously from Egypt, Syria and Jordan because of the Israeli air superiority. According to the report, Egypt and Syria's air forces, if reinforced with 16 air squadrons from other Arab countries would achieve numerical superiority. However, the Israelis offset <b>this</b> <b>by</b> superior training, avionics, aircraft payload and weaponry. A simultaneous Arab attack could dilute the effectiveness of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), and would force Israeli ground forces to fight a two-front war.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the crossbar, teams could play without a goalkeeper. The first reference to a goalkeeper appears in the report of the Battle of Bramall Lane in 1862. The position, however, was used as an alternative to sending off a player. Although a recognised position goalkeeper sometimes was also referred to in the rules as the player nearest their own goal (allowing him the luxury of handling the ball). Unlike its FA counterpart Sheffield Rules never restricted handling to one designated player. Despite <b>this</b> <b>by</b> the 1870s teams usually featured a single player in the position.|$|E

5|$|Coprinopsis variegata can attack soil bacteria, such as {{species of}} Pseudomonas and Agrobacterium, {{and use them}} as {{nutrient}} sources. The fungus achieves <b>this</b> <b>by</b> growing specialized hyphae {{in the direction of}} the bacteria, sensing them with some chemoattractive mechanism not yet fully understood. The fungus then secretes compounds to digest the bacteria while growing assimilative hyphae to absorb the nutrients. The process is relatively rapid, and bacterial colonies can be assimilated in less than 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|Decay {{had set in}} and {{the roof}} of the eastern limb {{collapsed}} during a gale on 4 December 1637. In 1640 the General Assembly ordered Gilbert Ross, the minister of St Giles kirk, to remove the rood screen which still partitioned the choir and presbytery from the nave. Ross was assisted in <b>this</b> <b>by</b> the Lairds of Innes and Brodie who chopped it up for firewood. It is believed that the destruction of the great west window was caused by Oliver Cromwell's soldiers sometime between 1650 and 1660.|$|E

5|$|Doubt {{was cast}} on <b>this</b> <b>by</b> Robert Dickson in 1878, when {{he pointed out}} that, while {{relatively}} high-status goods were found {{in some of the}} graves disinterred during early building work in Carnoustie, {{there was a lack of}} weapons. He also talked of the apparent presence of female skeletons. Subsequent finds pointed to the area being a domestic Pictish Long-Cist cemetery, including the remains of a female aged between 40 and 50 with osteoarthritis, who apparently died of tuberculosis. In contrast with Holinshed's account, the burials there are Christian, found in a supine, east-west orientation.|$|E
5|$|During oral argument, Justice Antonin Scalia {{responded to}} <b>this</b> <b>by</b> {{suggesting}} that some interests a person might express, such as recreational drugs, signified {{a willingness to}} violate social norms {{regardless of whether the}} conduct was illegal or not. Paul Larkin, who appeared for the government, had to admit to that there was no case law on entrapment where something that had previously been permitted was now prohibited. At one point, trying to argue that Jacobson did not have access to the defense of entrapment by estoppel (where the government persuades an actor that it is legal to do something, only to prosecute them for it), Scalia told Larkin he'd lost him.|$|E
5|$|Edwin Jarvis (portrayed by James D'Arcy) {{was charged}} with treason during the war after he forged the {{signature}} of his superior officer {{in an attempt to}} save the woman that would become his wife, Ana. Saved from <b>this</b> <b>by</b> Howard Stark, Jarvis becomes Stark's butler and is eventually offered to Carter as support for her mission to clear Stark's name. Befriending Carter, Jarvis came to enjoy his missions with her and chose to continue to help her with missions unrelated to Stark, such as the fight against Whitney Frost. For this, Ana became involved as well, until she was seriously injured by Frost. In retaliation, Jarvis unsuccessfully attempted to murder Frost.|$|E

5|$|In 1974, R.A. Powell raised two fisher kits for {{the purpose}} of {{performing}} scientific research.

The research lasted for two years. After one year, one of the fishers died due to unknown causes. The second was released back into the wilderness of Michigan's Upper Peninsula.|$|E
