25|$|The film {{is notable}} for its avant-garde style, shot on stark high-contrast {{black-and-white}} film, using the spherical cinematographic process with allusions to French New Wave cinema. The striking black-and-white photography of the film's cinematographer, Stephen H. Burum, lies in two main sources: the films of Orson Welles and German cinema of the 1920s. When {{the film was}} in its pre-production phase, Coppola asked Burum how he wanted to film it and they agreed {{that it might be}} the only chance they were ever going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a black-and-white film.|$|E

We thought, 'Well, we haven't got the budget we want, we haven't got the {{schedule}} we want, so we're going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it as brilliant as we can.' It was a costume drama and it needed a costume drama budget, and it didn't get that.|$|E
500|$|Marital {{infidelity}} features {{throughout the}} sections of the novel narrated by Sarah. Cleave discussed: [...] "When you are choosing a lover, you're choosing a philosophy; it's not about sex, it's not about marriage. With Sarah, her unfaithfulness {{is just one of}} the symptoms of the fact that she's torn and is going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this strong moral choice." [...] Sarah's storyline also explores her moral culpability following Andrew's suicide. Personal accountability is a central theme of the novel, with Elkins of The New York Times opining that by not focusing on [...] "postcolonial guilt or African angst", Cleave is able to use the novel to challenge readers' conceptions of civility and ethical choice. Margot Kaminski of the San Francisco Chronicle similarly feels that the book delivered a message of anti-complacency, however believes that is does so by [...] "bemoaning the normality of the First World in the face of the horrors of the Third." [...] She deemed The Other Hand essentially a novel about [...] "the borders we draw, and the real damage they inflict".|$|E

500|$|The Ford-powered M2B {{made its}} debut driven by McLaren at the world {{championship}} season-opening Monaco Grand Prix. There he qualified 10th on the grid and ran as high as sixth but retired after nine laps due to an oil leak. After Monaco McLaren decided [...] "it looks as though we're going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some fairly drastic moves in the engine room", and so for the next race in Belgium the Serenissima engine was used. The replacement unit did not provide an immediate solution though, terminally damaging its bearings in practice. With no spare, McLaren was unable to start the race. The team missed the next race in France, but at the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch the M2B finished sixth to score McLaren's first championship point. Another non-start resulted when the Serenissima failed again before the Dutch Grand Prix, and the entries for the German and Italian Grands Prix were withdrawn {{in anticipation of the}} improved Ford engine being readied. Thus equipped at the United States Grand Prix, McLaren drove to fifth place and two more points. At final event in Mexico, the rear bodywork was cut away to help prevent overheating but the engine failed during the race. McLaren had intended for Chris Amon, who was already racing sports cars for the team, to race a second car but the engine problems prevented this.|$|E
2500|$|Along with Waugh, {{selector}} {{and former}} batsman David Boon defended their selections. [...] "Sometimes you're going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a hard decision {{to keep a}} subtle rotation going through so you don't have mass retirements...But you've also got to pick the best cricket team you possibly can to represent your country", he stated. [...] "If we keep producing cricketers who are 25 plus, they're mature, they're ready to play, they've still got a seven or eight-year career, then we're doing OK." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stephen Harper {{hinted at}} the {{possibility}} of dissolving parliament on August 14, 2008. Speaking in Newfoundland and Labrador, he cited Stéphane Dion as the main player in making Parliament become increasingly [...] "dysfunctional". [...] "I’m going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a judgment in the next little while {{as to whether or not}} this Parliament can function productively," [...] Harper said. This came after repeated confidence votes that resulted in the NDP and Bloc parties not voting in favour of the government, and the Liberal Party voting in favour or not attending the vote. Rumours of a possible fall election were further fuelled by Harper's announcement of a fourth federal by-election for September 22 in the Toronto riding of Don Valley West.|$|E
30|$|Maximum generations {{limits the}} number of {{iterations}} that the GA is allowed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> before a final solution is identified. GA's are known to converge to near-optimal solutions, however {{the time it takes}} to reach a solution is an important consideration. In CR, the environment may change before the GA <b>has</b> <b>had</b> a chance <b>to</b> fully converge, therefore maximum generations cannot be too high. This leads <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some concessions into the final fitness of the solution. It may not have converged on the overall best solution. In this case, a 'good-enough' solution maybe a necessity.|$|R

2500|$|On October 6, 2010, Palin {{spoke with}} reporters and fielded a {{question}} about Social Security. She stated, [...] "e are going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some tough decisions today. Thomas Paine, one of our Founders, had said, 'If {{there is to be}} trouble, let it be in my day, so that my child may have peace.' What he meant way back then was that there should be an expectation that some sacrifices will have to be made, in our generation, so that future generations can have the opportunities that we've had to grow and thrive and prosper, so that our private sector can do what a private sector does best in creating jobs. So, yeah, with some practical things that have to be made, some decisions here, with perhaps changing, in future years, not adversely affecting those who are reliant on retirement benefits today, for instance, Social Security benefits, but changing, perhaps, the eligibility in future years. That has to be something that we're brave enough, courageous enough, to start talking about." ...|$|E
2500|$|These events {{known as}} the Haymarket Riots angered many people and gave a bad {{impression}} of the labor unions due to the violence that they had incurred. [...] However, protests such as these helped to make an impression upon the industrial heads. [...] It made them start {{to realize that they}} were going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> changes for the workers or suffer the consequences. [...] The Haymarket Riots were {{one of the things that}} set the era of worker reform into motion to help millions of people improve their lives. [...] Working to reform the eight-hour day paid off eventually and continues on today. [...] This showed the people in charge that laborers were no longer willing to be treated so inhumanely and that they would do what needed to be done in order to change what they wanted. [...] Because of this push for the eight-hour day, doors were open for reform of other unfair treatments of laborers. [...] It helped to work towards a more just labor system in general. [...] Young Jay Fox had been a part of this at the age of sixteen; he had helped in a cause to make a difference. [...] Not only this but he was able to leave behind writings that let future generations know what had happened in his account of the event “I Was At Haymarket.” [...] Through this piece of writing he showed what was going on at the time, what people decided to do about the unfair treatment, and the injustice of the authorities handling the situation.|$|E

6000|$|DEAR MISS MONROE,--Many {{thanks for}} your letter and your good wishes. It was much my desire to get to Chicago: had I done--or if I yet do--so, I shall hope to see the {{original}} of my photograph, {{which is one of}} my show possessions; but the fates are rather contrary. My wife is far from well; I myself dread, worse than almost any other imaginable peril, that miraculous and really insane invention the American Railroad Car. Heaven help the man--may I add the woman--that sets foot in one! Ah, if it were only an ocean to cross, it would be a matter of small thought to me--and great pleasure. But the railroad car--every man has his weak point; and I fear the railroad car as abjectly as I do an earwig, and, on the whole, on better grounds. You do not know how bitter it is <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> such a confession; for you have not the pretension nor the weakness of a man. If I do get to Chicago, you will hear of me: so much can be said. And do you never come east? ...|$|E
