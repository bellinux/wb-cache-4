5|$|A {{possible}} {{issue with}} the causeway's identification as a Roman structure in <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twentieth century was its incorporation of many small bends along its course. Roman military roads are usually straight in both their overall course, and also typically from one vantage point to the next. Both the Foss Way and the Stanegate, roads of established Roman provenance, have sinuous courses similar to Wade's causeway, so the objection is not conclusive.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the hearth}} tax returns of 1664, the {{township}} of Sale had {{a population of}} about 365. Parish registers show that the area experienced steady population growth during the 17th and 18th centuries, more so during <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century (due to the Industrial Revolution). This later growth was less rapid than that seen in neighbouring areas such as Altrincham, Bowdon or Stretford. The increase in growth in <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century also coincides {{with the arrival of the}} railway, indicative of Sale's growth as a commuter town. A huge increase in population in 1921–1931 is accounted for by the administrative merger of Sale with Ashton upon Mersey in 1930. Steady growth thereon is evident until 1981, when the decline of industry in Trafford and the Greater Manchester area accounts for a reduction in the town's population. This follows the general population trend for Greater Manchester, with residents relocating to new jobs. The table below details population changes since 1801, including the percentage change since the last census.|$|E
