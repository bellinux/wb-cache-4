The bill also allowed judges to sentence criminals to life without parole; previously, life without parole for 25years had been the harshest non-capital sentence.

25|$|The United States {{government}} has been making efforts since the late 1970s to accommodate {{this section of the}} population.

There has also been a decline of arrest rates in street youth, dropping in 30,000 arrests from 1998 to 2007.

40|$|The {{justice system}} handles {{thousands}} of cases involving juvenile victims each year. These victims {{are served by}} {{a complex set of}} agencies and institutions, including police, prosecutors, courts, and child protection agencies. Despite the many cases involving <b>juvenile</b> victims and <b>the</b> structure in place for responding to them, <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> victim <b>justice</b> system model presented in this Bulletin is a new concept. Although <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> victim <b>justice</b> system has a distinct structure and sequence, its operation is not very well understood. Unlike <b>the</b> more familiar <b>juvenile</b> offender <b>justice</b> system, <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> victim <b>justice</b> system has not been conceptualized as a whole or implemented by a common set of statutes. This Bulletin identifies the major elements of <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> victim <b>justice</b> system by delineating how cases move through the system. It reviews each step in the case flow process for the child protection and criminal justice systems and describes the interaction of the agencies an individuals involved. Recognizing how <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> victim <b>justice</b> system works can inform policy decisions and improve outcomes for <b>juvenile</b> victims. Acknowledging <b>the</b> existence of the system has important implications for system integration, information sharing, and data collection—all of which {{play a key role in}} ensuring the safety and well-being of juvenile victims...|$|R

25|$|The Human Rights Watch {{suggests}} that censuses of street {{children should be}} taken in various cities {{in order to help}} NGOs have accurate data about the street children population and plan programmes accordingly. The Human Rights Watch also makes various legal suggestions for the protection of street children in their study of police abuse and killings of street children. These suggestions include the amendment of Sections 53 and 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedures to make a medical examination necessary when a street child is detained, ratifying the United Nations 1984 Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and to amend <b>the</b> <b>Juvenile</b> <b>Justice</b> Act {{in order to create a}} mechanism for complaints and prosecutions for abuse.|$|E
25|$|Exception 2 {{of section}} 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), {{which deals with}} the {{punishment}} for rape, stated that “sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape.” However, the same provision states that a man is said to commit rape if he has sexual relations with a woman with or without her consent, when she is under 18 years of age. Thus, there was a discrepancy between the two sub-clauses. Independent Thought, a non-governmental organisation, in a petition in 2013, had challenged Exception 2. In a landmark ruling on 11 October 2017, the supreme court upheld the age of consent as 18 years. The {{court held that the}} distinction made between a married girl child and an unmarried girl child was illogical and ran against the provisions of the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act. Such a distinction also violated a child’s right to liberty and dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution. Irrespective of her marital status, sex with a minor girl will now attract a minimum rigorous imprisonment of ten years. Two other significant statues undermined by the IPC section were the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and <b>the</b> <b>Juvenile</b> <b>Justice</b> Act, both of which defines a child as someone below the age of 18.|$|E

50|$|The {{first of}} Florida's gradual efforts to shift <b>the</b> state's <b>juvenile</b> <b>justice</b> system {{away from a}} social {{services}} model occurred in 1994. The Legislature created <b>the</b> Department of <b>Juvenile</b> <b>Justice</b> (DJJ), providing for the transfer of powers, duties, property, records, personnel, and unexpended balances of related appropriations and other funds from <b>the</b> HRS <b>Juvenile</b> <b>Justice</b> Program Office to the new agency. DJJ was assigned responsibility for juvenile delinquency cases and children and families in need of services (CINS/FINS) cases. <b>Juvenile</b> <b>justice</b> provisions, which were then found in Chapter 39, F.S., remained virtually unchanged {{and most of the}} new agency's employees were former employees of HRS. Hence, philosophically, DJJ continued to approach juveniles as children in need of treatment and reform rather than criminals deserving punishment.|$|R
