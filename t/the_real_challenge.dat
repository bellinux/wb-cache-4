500|$|Nguyen Thanh Tam, {{commander}} of the Viet Cong 409th Battalion, ordered his 30th Company to leave their base area and marched into the Central Highlands, to reconnoitre and attack the U.S. airfield at Camp Holloway and the U.S. advisory compound of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam II Corps. In February 1965, Camp Holloway's outer perimeter was protected by a South Vietnamese security contingent which included one Ranger battalion, five Regional Force companies and one armored squadron. However, in their reconnaissance of Camp Holloway, the Viet Cong found the security barrier which surrounded the U.S. advisory compound was <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>challenge,</b> as it was protected by several layers of concertina wire fences which measured about [...] high.|$|E
500|$|Rick Cohoon of Allmusic {{praised the}} album for its musical variety, saying, [...] "With artists as well {{anchored}} in the business as Diamond Rio, the musical quality is a given. <b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>challenge</b> is outdoing yourself {{and coming up with}} fresh concepts. The selections on this album seem to be the fruition of that search for musical renewal". He cited [...] "Beautiful Mess" [...] and [...] "I Believe" [...] as standout tracks. Ray Waddell of Billboard also thought that the singles were among the best tracks on the album, while highlighting the instrumental track [...] "Rural Philharmonic" [...] (which Olander had originally intended to record for a solo album) {{as an example of the}} band's strong musicianship. Chrissie Dickinson of The Chicago Tribune was less favorable, commending the [...] "masterful musicianship" [...] and Roe's [...] "light vocal timbre", while criticizing the song selections as [...] "mostly a paint-by-numbers trip around the musical block, from the predictable power balladry of 'I Believe' to the saccharine sentiments of 'We All Fall Down.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Denning {{writes that}} <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>challenge</b> is {{keeping up with}} {{technological}} change, and in this sense, scientific management was the key American technological advance in the 20th century. It allowed American companies to provide large numbers of jobs to semi-skilled workers through supply-chain management, hierarchies, and rule-based systems. Businesses must now adjust to well-informed consumers who disdain profiteering and wish to be [...] "delighted". A related challenge is shifting from managing semi-skilled to knowledge workers. The Economist contrasted the [...] "Great Stagnation" [...] thesis with the [...] "Great Divergence" [...] which traces the pay gap to an increasing demand for skilled workers. Timothy Noah, writing in Slate, did not share Cowen's optimism {{about the future of}} American educational attainment on the basis that President Obama [...] "is getting tough" [...] on teachers' unions. There have been many reforms implemented in the last thirty years that the unions initially opposed, and the United States has poorer outcomes than many OECD countries with stronger unions. Noah reminds us that the earlier authors were optimistic about increased third level enrollment and that has since fallen as have graduation rates. The United States remains significantly behind other advanced countries in educational outcomes offering a perverse hope for improvement.|$|E

2500|$|Peter Garrison, {{contributing}} editor for Flying magazine, has said that [...] "in my opinion ... the most promising engine for aviation use is the Mazda rotary." [...] Mazda rotaries have worked well when converted for use in homebuilt aircraft. However, <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>challenge</b> in aviation is to produce FAA-certified alternatives to the standard reciprocating engines that power most small general aviation aircraft. Mistral Engines, based in Switzerland, developed purpose-built rotaries for factory and retrofit installations on certified production aircraft. The G-190 and G-230-TS rotary engines were already flying in the experimental market, and Mistral Engines hoped for FAA and JAA certification by 2011. , G-300 rotary engine development ceased, with the company citing cash flow problems.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>challenge</b> to {{his throne}} came with Bogdan II's son Ştefan cel Mare. The young prince {{had been given}} the {{protection}} of Kingdom of Hungary captain-general John Hunyadi and, after John's death, that of Vlad III Dracula (Vlad Ţepeş) - the new Prince of Wallachia. According to the interpretation of the account in the [...] Vlad had offered Ştefan his full support for his venture. In April 1457, after two battles, Peter was deposed and had to flee, taking refuge first in Poland and then in Székelyföld. There, he played a part in increasing the tensions between Ştefan cel Mare and King Matthias Corvinus. Following Matthias's incursion and subsequent defeat at the Battle of Baia (15 December 1467), Peter was captured and executed.|$|E
2500|$|The writing effort changed {{direction}} when Franklin {{fell ill}} and {{was removed from}} the production. Zimbalist offered the project to William Wyler, who had been one of 30 assistant directors on the 1925 film, in early 1957. Wyler initially rejected it, considering the quality of the script [...] to be [...] "very primitive, elementary" [...] and no better than hack work. It lacked good characterization, the dramatic structure was poor, and the leads were uninteresting (just [...] "villains and heroes"). Zimbalist showed Wyler some preliminary storyboards for the chariot race, and Wyler began to express an interest in the picture. Zimbalist told Wyler, [...] "Forget the chariot race. That's just second-unit stuff", stating that <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>challenge</b> would be to give the picture [...] "body, depth, intimacy", which Wyler was renowned for. Zimbalist also told Wyler that MGM would spend up to $10 million on the film, and Wyler, impressed with the large budget, agreed to review the script a second time. The more Wyler thought about the story, the more he became intrigued with its possibilities. However, {{according to a report in}} The New York Times, Wyler refused to take the job until he was sure he had a good leading man. MGM permitted Wyler to start casting, and in April 1957, mainstream media outlets reported that Wyler was giving screen tests to Italian leading men, such as Cesare Danova.|$|E
40|$|We {{argue that}} ongoing {{research}} in extensible kernels largely fails to address <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>challenges</b> facing <b>the</b> OS community. Instead, these efforts have become entangled {{in trying to}} solve the safety problems that extensibility itself introduces into OS design. We propose a pragmatic approach to extensibility, where kernel extensions are used in experimental settings to evaluate and develop OS enhancements for demanding applications. Once developed and well understood, these enhancements are then migrated into the base operating system for production use. This approach obviates the need for guaranteeing safety of kernel extensions, allowing the OS research community to re-focus on <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>challenges</b> in OS design and implementation. To provide a concrete example of this approach, we analyze the techniques used in experimental HTTP servers to show how proper application design combined with generic enhancements to operating systems can provide the same benefits without requiring applicati [...] ...|$|R
