5|$|A {{game played}} under time control will end as {{a loss for}} a player who uses up all of their allotted time, unless the {{opponent}} cannot possibly checkmate him (see the Timing section above). There are different types of time control. Players may have a fixed amount of time for the entire game or {{they may have to}} make a certain number of moves within a specified time. Also, a small increment of <b>time</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> added for each move made.|$|E
5|$|If morning {{cortisol}} {{levels are}} over 500nmol/l, ACTH deficiency is unlikely, whereas a level less than 100 is indicative. Levels between 100-500 require a stimulation test. This, too, {{is done with}} the insulin tolerance test. A cortisol level above 500 after achieving a low blood sugar rules out ACTH deficiency, while lower levels confirm the diagnosis. A similar stimulation test using corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is not sensitive enough {{for the purposes of}} the investigation. If the insulin tolerance test yields an abnormal result, a further test measuring the response of the adrenal glands to synthetic ACTH (the ACTH stimulation test) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Stimulation testing with metyrapone is an alternative. Some suggest that an ACTH stimulation test is sufficient as first-line investigation, and that an insulin tolerance test is only needed if the ACTH test is equivocal. The insulin tolerance test is discouraged in children. None of the tests for ACTH deficiency are perfect, and further tests after a period of <b>time</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> needed if initial results are not conclusive.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{function}} of equipment in SaGa games {{is to increase}} character attributes. Arming a character with a gold helmet increases his or her base defense statistic, for example. The amount of equipment that can be placed on any one character at any time depends on the character's class. Humans can hold eight, mutants four, and monsters none. There are five types of armor: shields, helmets, breastplates, gauntlets, and shoes. Only one of each at a <b>time</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> added to one character and cannot be added to monsters. Weapons, consisting of swords, hammers, whips, spell books, and guns, utilize either the strength, agility or mana attribute of a character, {{and can be used}} only a certain number of times before breaking and being removed from the player's inventory. Shields can be used as items in combat, most with a limited number of uses, and allow the user to evade enemy attacks.|$|E

5|$|A {{standard}} adult football match {{consists of}} two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most {{commonly referred to as}} stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, {{towards the end of the}} half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage <b>time</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90minutes had elapsed and the game was over. The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.|$|E

25|$|Club cricket, by far {{and away}} the widest form of cricket played worldwide, is largely amateur, but still formal, cricket, with the teams {{organised}} into leagues. The games are sometimes limited-overs, with each innings usually lasting between twenty and fifty overs. Other matches are played to time restrictions. Restrictions in overs or <b>time</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> placed on each side individually, or they may stipulate the total length of the match. The latter more traditional case is often known as declaration cricket.|$|E

25|$|According to Roche, {{side effects}} are most severe when {{beginning}} therapy and may decrease in frequency with time; this {{is supported by}} the results of the XENDOS study, which found that 36% of people had gastrointestinal adverse effects during their fourth year of taking orlistat, whereas 91% of study subjects had experienced at least one GI-related side effect {{during the first year of}} treatment. It has also been suggested that the decrease in side effects over <b>time</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> associated with long-term compliance with a low-fat diet.|$|E
25|$|Some {{view the}} three-age system as over-simple; that is, it neglects vital detail and forces complex {{circumstances}} into a mold {{they do not}} fit. Rowlands argues that the division of human societies into epochs based on the presumption of a single set of related changes is not realistic:But as a more rigorous sociological approach has begun to show that changes at the economic, political and ideological levels are not 'all of apiece' {{we have come to}} realise that <b>time</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> segmented in as many ways as convenient to the researcher concerned.|$|E
25|$|Large {{databases}} {{have historically}} been kept on disk drives. The time to read a record on a disk drive far exceeds {{the time needed to}} compare keys once the record is available. The time to read a record from a disk drive involves a seek time and a rotational delay. The seek <b>time</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> 0 to 20 or more milliseconds, and the rotational delay averages about half the rotation period. For a 7200 RPM drive, the rotation period is 8.33 milliseconds. For a drive such as the Seagate ST3500320NS, the track-to-track seek time is 0.8 milliseconds and the average reading seek time is 8.5 milliseconds. For simplicity, assume reading from disk takes about 10 milliseconds.|$|E

25|$|Sensory dissonance and its two perceptual manifestations (beating and roughness) {{are both}} {{closely related to}} a sound signal's {{amplitude}} fluctuations. Amplitude fluctuations describe variations in the maximum value (amplitude) of sound signals relative to a reference point and {{are the result of}} wave interference. The interference principle states that the combined amplitude of two or more vibrations (waves) at any given <b>time</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> larger (constructive interference) or smaller (destructive interference) than the amplitude of the individual vibrations (waves), depending on their phase relationship. In the case of two or more waves with different frequencies, their periodically changing phase relationship results in periodic alterations between constructive and destructive interference, giving rise to the phenomenon of amplitude fluctuations.|$|E
25|$|A {{team led}} by Sheena Josselyn in the Silva Lab {{discovered}} that there are molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate which neurons in a circuit encode a given memory (neuronal memory allocation). They found that the transcription factor CREB modulates the probability that individual amygdala neurons become involved in storing a specific emotional memory: higher levels of CREB increase this probability while lower levels of CREB have the opposite effect. Later, Yu Zhou and colleagues in the Silva lab discovered that CREB modulates memory allocation by regulating neuronal excitability. These studies suggested that the mechanisms that consolidate one memory, for a limited period of <b>time,</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> involved in determining the allocation of the next memory, so that the two memories are associated or linked.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{it appears}} that a brief 0.25-second {{exposure}} to a <5nbsp&mW laser such as found in red laser pointers does not {{pose a threat to}} eye health. On the other hand, there is a potential for injury if a person deliberately stares into a beam of a classnbsp&IIIa laser for few seconds or more at close range. Even if injury occurs, most people will fully recover their vision. Further experienced discomforts than these may be psychological rather than physical. With regard to green laser pointers the safe exposure <b>time</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> less, and with even higher powered lasers instant permanent damage should be expected. These conclusions must be qualified with recent theoretical observations that certain prescription medications may interact with some wavelengths of laser light, causing increased sensitivity (phototoxicity).|$|E
