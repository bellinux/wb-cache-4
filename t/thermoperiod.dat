50|$|The {{induction}} phase occurs at a genetically predetermined stage of life, and occurs {{well in advance}} of the environmental stress. This sensitive stage may occur within the lifetime of the diapausing individual, or in preceding generations, particularly in egg diapause. During this phase, insects are responsive to external cues called token stimuli, which trigger the switch from direct development pathways to diapause pathways. Token stimuli can consist of changes in photoperiod, <b>thermoperiod,</b> or allelochemicals from food plants. These stimuli are not in themselves favourable or unfavourable to development, but they herald an impending change in environmental conditions.|$|E
50|$|Environmental {{regulators}} of diapause generally {{display a}} characteristic seasonal pattern. In temperate regions, photoperiod {{is the most}} reliable cues of seasonal change. Depending on the season in which diapause occurs, either short or long days can act as token stimuli. Insects may also respond to changing day length as well as relative day length. Temperature may also act as a regulating factor, either by inducing diapause or, more commonly, by modifying {{the response of the}} insect to photoperiod. Insects may respond to <b>thermoperiod,</b> the daily fluctuations of warm and cold that correspond with night and day, as well as to absolute or cumulative temperature. Food availability and quality may also help regulate diapause. In the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, a plant hormone called gibberellin stimulates reproductive development. During the dry season, when their food plants are in senescence and lacking gibberellin, the locusts remain immature and their reproductive tracts do not develop.|$|E

The seeds, of varieties glauca and menziesii, came from eight widely separated areas. Plants from both varieties made maximum growth with soil and air temperatures between 18 and 24 C during the 20 weeks of the study. Little requirement for diurnal fluctuation in temperature was evident. Low soil temperatures greatly reduced growth and hastened dormancy of plants grown under all the <b>thermoperiods</b> tested.

In container-grown seedlings, {{it was found that}} warm <b>thermoperiod</b> with moderate moisture stress and cool <b>thermoperiod</b> with low moisture stress induced dormancy in the initial stage of the experiment. Short photoperiod with warm <b>thermoperiod</b> and long photoperiod with cool <b>thermoperiod</b> hastened onset of dormancy in a later stage. Short photoperiod and cool <b>thermoperiod,</b> which acted independently, could also induce dormancy. Both Shasta red fir and noble fir seedlings showed a typical terminal bud dormancy. Six to eight weeks of chilling were required to overcome the dormancy. Dormancy induction method influenced chilling requirements. Seedlings induced into dormancy by long cool days required less chilling than did the seedlings induced into dormancy by short warm days. Long photoperiod during chilling could conpensate for inadequate chilling. The survival, phenology and growth of non-chilled true fir seedlings were determined for two seasons in two irrigation regimes. Regardless of species, survival was not different between any treatments. Unchilled terminal buds stayed inactive during the first season after outplanting. These terminal buds resumed growth after being chilled naturally during the winter. Lateral branch development was observed for both growing seasons. Growth was greater in the moist irrigation regime than the dry irrigation regime. Dormancy induction in natural low- and high-elevation environments was investigated by using a switch-back experimental design. It was determined that lower night temperature in the high-elevation areas triggered growth cessation in the seedlings and thus earlier dormancy. High moisture stress early in the season could also prematurely cease seedling growth and impose stress-induced dormancy...|$|E

Las semillas se sometieron a tres diferentes termoperiodos (0 °C/ 20 °C, 5 °C/ 25 °C y 10 °C/ 30 °C) y a siete diferentes concentraciones de NaCl (200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1500 y 3000 mM) y como testigo se usó agua destilada (0 mM NaCl) utilizando un fotoperiodo de 12 h oscuridad/ 12 h luz. En los resultados, las semillas sin testa presentaron el mayor porcentaje de germinación en todos los termoperiodos en agua destilada. En los termoperiodos de 5 °C/ 25 °C y 10 °C/ 30 °C se obtuvo una germinación de alrededor del 97 % para los tres tipos de semillas, mientras que en el de 0 °C/ 20 °C en semillas sin testa se obtuvo el 72 %; en las semillas de testa café fue del 7 % y en las de testa negra del 1 %. Las concentraciones de NaCl reducen la germinación de las semillas sin testa en promedio un 12 % a 1000 mM de NaCl en todos los termoperiodos. En las semillas de testa café la reducción fue del 3 % a 600 mM de NaCl en un termoperiodo de 5 °C/ 25 °C y en las de testa negra no hubo germinación en concentraciones salinas. En conclusión, la germinación de Suaeda mexicana varía de acuerdo al tipo de semilla, termoperiodo y salinidad expuesta, siendo la semilla sin testa la que mejor responde.

One {{purpose of this study was}} to observe environmental influences on the anatomy of the needle. It was found that the natural-grown seedlings had a thicker needle than those grown under any treatment. This additional thickness was composed of an additional row of palisade cells and typically longer cells in comparison with those needles formed under low light intensity with various combinations of photoperiod and <b>thermoperiod,</b> and larger palisade cells than those needles formed under high light intensity and various combinations of photoperiod and <b>thermoperiod.</b> The upper cuticle of those needles formed under a natural environnient was not larger than that formed under high light but had twice the thickness of those cuticles formed under low light.

The second purpose of this study is to observe the environmental influences on the anatomy of the hypocotyl. The number of tracheid cells increased with the longer photoperiod, warmer night temperature, and lower light intensity. The size of the hypocotyl was directly related to photoperiod and night temperature. There was a difference between seed sources in the thickness of the tracheid cell wall and lumen diameter but not for tracheid diameter.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{affecting}} UK agriculture, and {{research is needed}} to prepare crops for the future. Wheat is the UK’s most important crop, and needs to be protected from losses caused by disease. While direct effect of the environment on pathogen spread is often reported, effect of the environment on host defence is not. Many wheat resistance genes are temperature sensitive and these were used as a starting point to investigate defence temperature sensitivity in wheat starting with yellow rust resistance gene Yr 36, previously shown to be temperature-sensitive. The effect of temperature on resistance was shown to be independent of Yr 36 in breeding line UC 1041, and was more likely to be due to a previously-uncharacterised background temperature sensitivity. These results suggest that temperature changes, rather than thresholds, might influence some disease resistance mechanisms. Understanding this phenomenon could enable the breeding of more stable defence in crops. In order to gain further insight into how temperature changes influence resistance, plants were grown under different <b>thermoperiods</b> and challenged with different types of pathogens; Results showed that resistance to multiple pathogens in one cultivar Claire was enhanced under variable temperatures, compared to constant temperatures. Taken together, the research presented revealed that defence temperature sensitivity in plants is much more complex than previously thought, considering that both temperature changes and different <b>thermoperiods</b> can influence aspects of wheat defence. To ascertain which research approaches will be most valuable in preparing for climate change, the effect of the environment on take-all was also investigated. Vulnerable periods for wheat from the threat of take-all development were identified by analysing historical datasets, and controlled environment experiments. Results showed a relationship between initial post-sowing temperatures and spring take-all levels in 2 nd 3 rd or 4 th winter wheats, depending on the location.

Each experiment was conducted under continuous irradiation of 400 micromoles per square meter per second of photosynthetic photon flux and included two temperature treatments: constant 18 °C and fluctuating 22 °C/ 14 °C on a 12 -hour cycle. A common vapor pressure deficit of 0. 62 kilopascal was maintained at all temperatures. Plants under constant 18 °C were stunted and had chlorotic and abscised leaves and essentially no tuber formation. Plants grown under the fluctuating temperature treatment developed normally, were developing tubers, and had a fivefold or greater total dry weight as compared with those under the constant temperature.

Trabalhos anteriores demonstraram que a isoforma citossólica da NR está presente nas folhas e raízes do abacaxizeiro; já as associadas à membrana plasmática (NRMP) ainda não se tem registro.

Além disso, estudou-se a influência da idade das plantas na resposta ao tratamento com baixa temperatura noturna. Plantas cultivadas in vitro com 90 dias de idade ou com idades variadas foram transferidas para câmaras de crescimento com temperatura constante (28 °C dia/noite controle experimental) ou com termoperíodo (28 °C dia/ 15 °C noite), fotoperíodo de 16 horas e intensidade luminosa de 55 moles m- 2 s - 1. Elas permaneceram nessas condições por 1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 30, 40, 50 ou 60 dias. Após cada período, a atividade in vivo da NR foi analisada durante a fase de ausência de luz. Para que fosse possível identificar uma possível NRMP nas células radiculares de abacaxizeiro, um método de ensaio in vitro foi padronizado e a melhor técnica de isolamento de frações de membrana plasmática foi selecionada. Após as plantas com 60 dias de idade serem submetidas por 30 dias ao tratamento termoperiódico ou à temperatura constante, as frações de membrana plasmática das células radiculares foram isoladas e o ensaio in vitro da NR foi realizado, utilizando-se NADH, NADPH ou succinato como doadores de elétrons. Os resultados indicaram que o tempo mínimo de exposição das plantas de abacaxizeiro ao termoperíodo foi de 30 dias. O método de ensaio enzimático in vitro foi padronizado para as plantas de abacaxizeiro e a técnica de isolamento de frações de membrana plasmática que se mostrou mais adequada para essa bromélia foi a de fracionamento por sistema de duas fases com Dextran T- 500 e PEG 3350. O grau de pureza das frações, avaliado pela detecção da atividade da enzima citoplasmática malato desidrogenase (MDH), foi em média de 95 %, evidenciando a eficácia da pradronização do método. Os resultados obtidos para as frações de membranas plasmáticas, extraídas das raízes das plantas que estiveram sob o tratamento termoperiódico, mostraram que a baixa temperatura noturna influenciou positivamente a atividade da nitrato redutase. O aumento da atividade foi observado quando NADH, NADPH ou succinato foram utilizados como doadores de elétrons. Isso significa que, provavelmente, mais de uma isoforma da NRMP está presente nas raízes de abacaxizeiro. Além disso, há indícios de que a isoforma que está ligada externamente à membrana por uma âncora glicosídica (que utiliza succinato como doador de elétrons) está presente nas células radiculares do abacaxizeiro e respondeu positivamente ao estímulo da baixa temperatura noturna. Em contrapartida, nenhuma diferença pôde ser observada quando as atividades da NR foram medidas nas frações de citoplasma das plantas controle e daquelas que foram tratadas com termoperíodo. Não foi detectada atividade nas frações citossólicas quando succinato foi oferecido como poder redutor da NR. Concluiu-se, portanto, que o incremento na atividade da NR, verificado nas plantas que foram tratadas com termoperíodo, deveu-se à indução pela baixa temperatura noturna da NRMP. Esta pesquisa trouxe contribuições importantes acerca da existência de uma nitrato redutase associada à membrana plasmática em abacaxizeiro, nunca antes detectada em uma bromélia e muito pouco estudada nos demais vegetais. As padronizações realizadas serão essenciais para aplicação em outras pesquisas do Laboratório de Fisiologia Vegetal do IBUSP, abrindo oportunidades para se aprofundar ainda mais o tema sobre o controle da ativação da NR. The nitrate reductase (NR) acts {{together with the}} nitrite reductase (NiR) to catalyze {{the first step of}} the nitrate reduction. The NR localized in the cytosol is activated mainly by light and reduces nitrate to nitrite, followed by its reduction to ammonium. Previous work demonstrated that the cytosolic isoform of NR is present in leaves and roots of Ananas comosus, although the isoform associated with the plasma membrane (PM-NR) has not yet been registered in this species. The PM-NR has different modes of activation in comparison to the cytosolic NR, as already demonstrated in other species. Among the factors that affect its activity can be mentioned the temperature. Experiments developed in the Laboratory of Plant Physiology of IBUSP hypothesized that exists a specific plasma membrane NR in plant roots regulated by <b>thermoperiod,</b> differing from the cytosolic isoform present in leaves. The present work aimed to demonstrate the existence of this isoform of NR present in the plasma membrane, which would be responsible for the increase of its activity in Ananas comosus roots when plants were cultivated in vitro under <b>thermoperiod</b> of 28 °C day/ 15 °C night. Initially, it was important to determine the minimum time of exposure to <b>thermoperiod</b> necessary for the induction of nitrate reductase in roots of pineapple plants. Furthermore, it was analyzed the influence of age in the response of plants to low night temperature treatment. For this purpose, plants with different ages cultivated in vitro were transferred to growth chambers either with constant temperature (28 °C day/night experimental control) or with <b>thermoperiod</b> (28 °C day/ 15 °C night). The plants were cultivated in these conditions during 1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 30, 40, 50 or 60 days and then the in vivo NR activity was analyzed in the shoot and root tissues during the dark period. In order to identify a probable PM-NR in the pineapple root cells, it was also necessary to develop a NR in vitro assay protocol specific for Ananas comosus and the appropriate technique for plasma membrane isolation (Dextran T- 500 and PEG 3350). The purity of the fractions, determined by the activity of cytoplasmic enzyme malate dehydrogenase (MDH), was on average 95 %, indicating the effectiveness of the method. The next step was to evaluate the NR activity in citoplasmic and plasma membrane fractions of root tissues of Ananas comosus. Using 60 daysold plants exposed either to 30 days under the thermoperiodic treatment or to constant temperature, the plasma membrane fractions of roots were isolated and the in vitro NR assay was performed using NADH, NADPH or succinate as electron donators. The results indicated that the minimum <b>thermoperiod</b> exposure time necessary to induce NR activity was 30 days. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that low temperatures during the dark period positively influenced the activity of nitrate reductase in plasma membrane fractions and that the increase in its activity was observed when NADH, NADPH or succinate were used as electron donors. On the other hand, no difference in NR activity was observed in the cytoplasmic fraction of control plants and those which were treated with <b>thermoperiod.</b> Moreover, no NR activity was detected in cytosolic fractions when succinate was provided as electron donor. All together, this results showed that probably diferents isoforms are presents in pineapple roots. The extracellular isoform that is attached to the plasma membrane by a lipophilic anchor (using succinate as electron donor) can be present in root cells of pineapple and responded positively to the low night temperature stimulus. This study has made important contributions to the knowledge of the metabolism and physiology of Ananas comosus.

40|$|The sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) {{cultivar}} 58 M, {{which contains}} the null mutant phytochrome B gene, shows reduced photoperiodic sensitivity and exhibits a shade-avoidance phenotype. Ethylene production by seedlings of wild-type and phytochrome B mutant cultivars was monitored every 3 h, and both cultivars {{were found to}} produce ethylene in a circadian rhythm, with peak production occurring during the day. The phytochrome B mutant produces rhythmic peaks of ethylene with approximately 10 times the amplitude of the wild-type counterpart with the same period and diurnal timing. The source of the mutant's additional ethylene is the shoot. The diurnal rhythm can be produced with either light or temperature cycles; however, both light and temperature cycles are required for circadian entrainment. The temperature signal overrides the light signal {{in the production of}} diurnal rhythms, because seedlings grown under <b>thermoperiods</b> reversed with the photoperiod produced ethylene peaks during the warm nights. To examine the effect of extreme shading on ethylene production, seedlings were grown under dim, far-red-enriched light. This treatment duplicated the phytochrome B mutant's shade-avoidance phenotype in the wild type and caused the wild type to produce ethylene peaks similar to those observed in the mutant. The results confirm that phytochrome B is not required for proper function of circadian timing, but it may be involved in modulating physiological rhythms driven by the biological clock oscillator...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} upon {{the pattern of}} meiotic development was studied in PMC in Picea abies. The twigs were collected from grafts and exposed to different temperature conditions in a climatic cabinet. (The <b>thermoperiods</b> used were + 20 °Cl + 15 °C and + 15 °C/+ 10 °C respectively.) The rate {{as well as the}} temperature sum requirement of the development within given limits were compared. The data obtained are compiled in Figure 31. Significant differences obtained in some instances indicate that at least some phases of development are accelerated by a rise in the temperature. However, the results were somewhat contradictory with respect to different phases of the meiotic development. For example a shorter time and a smaller temperature sum were needed for the development from diplotene to interkinesis (compared at the 50 per cent level) in the experiment carried out at the higher temperature. On the other hand, the reaching of tetrads proceeded faster and had a lower ternperature sum requirement in the lower temperature conditions. The exposure of the material to - 5 O°C caused a delay in the meiotic development. Furthermore, the induction of irregularities in PMC following the treatment at - 5 °C was studied. Data on the frequency of different types of irregularity, the frequency of irregularities at different meiotic stages as well as the relationship between the occurrence of sensitive stages during the treatment at - 5 °C and the frequency of irregularities were presented. The relationships between the origin of the material {{on the one hand and}} the pattern of meiotic development or the frequency of irregularities induced on the other hand were discussed...|$|R
40|$|The great European spruce {{bark beetle}} (Dendroctonus micans, Curculionidae: Scolytinae) and the boreal spruce beetle (D. punctatus) are two phylogenetically and ecologically close bark beetles. They bore {{galleries}} into the bark of spruce in Europe and Asia (D. micans) and North America (D. punctatus). We analyze the mechanisms of coevolution between these species and their specific predators: D. micans-Rhizophagus grandis (Coleoptera: Monotomidae) and D. punctatus-Hapalaraea longula (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae). David Pimentel(2) suggested that a prey could evolve resistance against a longstanding associated predator. To test this hypothesis we compare the reproductive success of each predator on both prey and on the red turpentine beetle (D. valens) which is an ecologically close bark beetle outside the geographical range of the predators. R. grandis females fit their oviposition to prey availability probably relying on kairomones. It is likely (but not established) that H. longula developed a similar process. I proceed to chemical analyses (GC-MS using headspace extraction) to identify oviposition stimuli and inhibitors of each predator. Possible differences between prey {{may be linked to}} coevolution with the predator. Bioassays will be able to confirm the role of these molecules. Microorganisms could influence the survival and success of bark beetles, and perhaps also the chemical cues involved in oviposition of the predators. To emphasize their role I consider characterizing the microflora of each bark beetle and using antibiotics. D. micans adults have a reproductive diapause which has never been removed in laboratory. To get full life cycle rearing we use <b>thermoperiods</b> in conditioned rooms to simulate winter. (2) -Hokkanen H. & Pimentel D. (1984) New approach for selecting biological control agents.

40|$|The {{vertebrate}} pineal gland is {{the primary}} source of melatonin, the rhythmic secretion of which is influenced by environmental light and temperature, thereby providing animals with information about seasonally changing photoperiod and <b>thermoperiod.</b> Although pineal glands are present in the majority of vertebrate species, a discrete organ is reported to be absent in the Crocodilia. However, if the melatonin rhythm is crucial to the survival of the organism, it would be expected that the rhythm would be present in crocodiles. In the present study, we measured blood plasma melatonin over a 30 -h period in aestivating Australian freshwater crocodiles (Crocodylus johnstoni) in their natural habitat {{at the end of the}} dry season (November) and found no discernible melatonin rhythm. However, another group of captive-reared C. johnstoni, maintained under natural light and temperature cycles and sampled in the early dry season (June) showed a clear melatonin rhythm. These results suggest that there is either an extrapineal source of melatonin in this crocodile species or that there is melatonin producing tissue elsewhere which heretofore has not been discovered. Further studies are needed to determine why the melatonin rhythm is intermittently expressed and whether this may be related to seasonal changes in the expression of the rhythm linked to tropical environments.

Mature canopies were divided into three horizontal layers of equal depth. Canopies were defoliated at each layer, from the ground upward, on successive days. Response curves for photosynthetic rate vs. irradiance were obtained after each defoliation. Leaf area within each layer followed a quadratic rela-tionship with temperature. The largest areas were between 16. 6 and 22. 1 C.

The results are as follows: {{there is no significant}} difference in morphology, such as size and thousandseed weight, between seeds from different the spring and summer flowering periods. Freshly harvested spring and summer flowering period seeds can both rapidly germinate under the 5 / 15 °C, 5 / 25 °C, 15 / 25 °C or 25 / 35 °C <b>thermoperiods.</b> Average germination time of the spring flowering period seeds is shorter than that of the summer flowering period seeds, with a TG 50 of 2 - 18 hours (TG 50 = the time when germinate percentage reached 50 %). NaCl solutions at concentrations below 0. 2 mol/L have no significant effect on the germination of Tamarix ramosissima seeds from either flowering periods. However, at above 0. 4 mol/L, higher NaCl concentrations adversely affect the Tamarix ramosissima seeds’ germination rates. Seeds from the summer flowering period have higher tolerance of NaCl solutions than seeds from the spring flowering period. Seeds that were incubated in NaCl solution for 8 days cannot recover after being transferred to distilled water (0 % recovery), indicating that NaCl treated seeds permanently lost their germination capability. After storing in room temperature for 2 months, Tamarix ramosissima seeds from both spring and summer flowering periods maintain above 80 % viability. After 2 months, the seed viabilities decrease as the storage time lengthens.

From 1995 up to 1998 several trials for hormonal induction of final maturation and spawning have been tested on wild dusky grouper females (body weight 2. 2 - 10. 1 Kg) adapted to captivity. Three broodstocks were maintained under natural photoperiod applying both natural and controlled <b>thermoperiods.</b> Fish with vitellogenic oocytes (> 350 m) were induced (n= 8) both with Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) at 500 - 2000 UI/Kg dosage, given in multiple injections, and with HCG (2000 UI/Kg) in combination with sea bass pituitary (7 - 9 mg/Kg). HCG partially mimicked natural gonadotropin, inducing ovulation only in synergy with pituitary. GnRHa-Dep in microspheres (Triptoreline, Decapeptyl, Ipsen Biotech) at 40 - 50 g/Kg induced multiple spawning in 50 % of females (n= 26) with oocytes > 350 m. Vitellogenic oocytes  350 m were not sensitive to HCG, pituitary extracts, GnRHa and GnRHa-Dep.
