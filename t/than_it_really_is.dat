5|$|Ten {{stars have}} been found to have planets to date, and four {{planetary}} systems have been discovered with the SuperWASP project. HD 142 is a yellow giant that has an apparent magnitude of 5.7, and has a planet (HD 142 b)1.36 times the mass of Jupiter which orbits every 328 days. HD 2039 is a yellow subgiant with an apparent magnitude of 9.0 around 330 light years away which has a planet (HD 2039 b) triple the mass of Jupiter. WASP-18 is a star of magnitude 9.29 which was discovered to have a hot Jupiter-like planet (WASP-18b) taking less than a day to orbit the star. The planet is suspected to be causing WASP-18 to appear older <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is.</b> WASP-4 and WASP-5 are solar-type yellow stars around 1000 light years distant and of 13th magnitude, each with a single planet larger than Jupiter. WASP-29 is an orange dwarf of spectral type K4V and visual magnitude 11.3, which has a planetary companion of similar size and mass to Saturn. The planet completes an orbit every 3.9 days.|$|E
25|$|David Kronke, The Daily News of Los Angeles (April 22, 2001) — Nero Wolfe, alas, is {{undone by}} uneven {{performances}} {{and a sense}} that it's more witty and urbane <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is.</b> Hutton is too antic — {{he seems to be}} playing the sassy newsroom copy boy in a '30s B-picture — and his narration tries far too hard to push jokes that just aren't funny. Maury Chaykin, a normally reliable character actor, is alternately flat or rudderlessly blustery as Wolfe.|$|E
25|$|Virtual gastric band uses {{hypnosis}} to {{make the}} brain think the stomach is smaller <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> and hence lower {{the amount of food}} ingested. This brings as a consequence weight reduction. This method is complemented with psychological treatment for anxiety management and with hypnopedia. Research has been conducted into the use of hypnosis as a weight management alternative. In 1996 a study found that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was more effective for weight reduction if reinforced with hypnosis. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy ACT, a mindfulness approach to weight loss, has also {{in the last few years}} been demonstrating its usefulness.|$|E

500|$|Commenting in {{an article}} in Cherwell, Samuel Rutishauser-Mills {{questioned}} why the media bothered reporting on Gasper's anti-LGBT comments, noting that as a parish councillor her [...] "political significance is tenuous... and scarcely newsworthy or interesting." [...] He warned that excessive coverage of such opinions was counterproductive to the advancement of LGBT rights, by making [...] "extreme homophobia" [...] seem more commonplace <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E
500|$|Any {{addition}} of carbon {{to a sample}} of a different age will cause the measured date to be inaccurate. Contamination with modern carbon causes a sample to appear to be younger than it really is: the effect is greater for older samples. If a sample that is 17,000 years old is contaminated so that 1% of the sample is modern carbon, it will appear to be 600 years younger; for a sample that is 34,000 years old the same amount of contamination would cause an error of 4,000 years. Contamination with old carbon, with no remaining , causes an error in the other direction [...] independent of age– a sample contaminated with 1% old carbon will appear to be about 80 years older <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is,</b> regardless of the date of the sample.|$|E

2500|$|Self-verification theory {{predicts that}} people’s self-views will {{cause them to}} see the world as more {{supportive}} of these self-views <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is.</b> That is, individuals process information in a biased manner. These biases may be conscious and deliberate, but are probably more commonly done effortlessly and non-consciously. Through the creative use of these processes, people may dramatically increase their chances of attaining self-verification.

2500|$|Armin is {{generally}} credited {{with all the}} [...] "licensed fools" [...] in the repertory of the Chamberlain's and King's Men: Touchstone in As You Like It, Feste in Twelfth Night, the Fool in King Lear, Lavatch in All's Well That Ends Well, and perhaps Thersites in Troilus and Cressida, the Porter in Macbeth, the Fool in Timon of Athens, and Autolycus in The Winter's Tale. [...] Of these eight, Touchstone is the fool about which there is the most critical discussion. Harold Bloom describes him as [...] "rancidly vicious," [...] and writes that [...] "this more intense rancidity works as a touchstone should, to prove the true gold of Rosalind's spirit". John Palmer disagrees and writes that [...] "he must be either a true cynic or one that affects his cynicism to mask a fundamentally genial spirit". Obviously, as Palmer continues, a true cynic does not belong in Arden, so the clown [...] "must be a thoroughly good fellow at heart". Touchstone affects {{the front of a}} malcontented cynic, thus serving as proof of Rosalind's quick wit. When she confronts both Jaques and Touchstone, she exposes their silliness and prevents the fools from making Arden out to be worse <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The ATOC {{project was}} embroiled in issues {{concerning}} {{the effects of}} acoustics on marine mammals (e.g. whales, porpoises, sea lions, etc.). Public discussion was complicated by technical issues {{from a variety of}} disciplines (physical oceanography, acoustics, marine mammal biology, etc.) that makes understanding the effects of acoustics on marine mammals difficult for the experts, let alone the general public. [...] Many of the issues concerning acoustics in the ocean and their effects on marine mammals were unknown. [...] Finally, there were a variety of public misconceptions initially, such as a confusion of the definition of sound levels in air vs. sound levels in water. [...] If a given number of decibels in water are interpreted as decibels in air, the sound level will seem to be orders of magnitude larger <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> - at one point the ATOC sound levels were erroneously interpreted as [...] "louder than 10,000 747 airplanes". [...] In fact, the sound powers employed, 250 W, were comparable those made by blue or fin whales, although those whales vocalize at much lower frequencies. The ocean carries sound so efficiently that sounds {{do not have to be}} that loud to cross ocean basins. [...] Other factors in the controversy were the extensive history of activism where marine mammals are concerned, stemming from the ongoing whaling conflict, and the sympathy that much of the public feels toward marine mammals.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} shown that most of the {{pictures}} that were distributed to the media were altered through the use of digital enhancement and perspectiveto make the pig look much larger <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was.</b> There were also claims that there were other photographs from the Stone family owned Monsterpig.com website (since removed) that showed a more normal size/scale for the pig.

After Taylor took the opening 2 sets, Priestley won 7 of the next 10 legs before a relieved Taylor wrapped up a 4-1 win, which looked more one-sided on paper <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
5000|$|During the {{classical}} period, Prisca Latinitas, Prisca Latina and other idioms using the adjective always meant these {{remnants of a}} previous language, which, in the Roman philology, was taken to be much older in fact <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was.</b> Viri prisci, [...] "old-time men," [...] were the population of Latium before the founding of Rome.|$|R

50|$|Painted {{doors were}} used {{frequently}} in the decoration of both First- and Second style interiors of Roman villas. An example is the villa of Julius Polybius in Pompeii, where a false door is painted on a wall opposite a real door to achieve symmetry. Apart from creating architectural balance, they could serve to make the villa seem larger <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The jurors, two by two, examined, measured, muttered, {{while the}} {{audience}} waited in growing impatience for their report.

60|$|The masque, though thin, is perfect. The brow, {{like that}} of Greek statue, looks lower <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is,</b> for the hair springs from below the bend of the forehead.

If you had wings in proportion, it would be with the utmost difficulty that you could use them at all.
