5000|$|One {{consequence}} of the dead time effect {{is the possibility of}} a high count rate continually <b>triggering</b> the <b>tube</b> before the recovery time has elapsed. This may produce pulses too small for the counting electronics to detect and lead to the very undesirable situation whereby a G-M counter in a very high radiation field is falsely indicating a low level. This phenomenon is known as [...] "fold-back". An industry rule of thumb is that the discriminator circuit receiving the output from the tube should detect down to 1/10 of the magnitude of a normal pulse to guard against this. Additionally the circuit should detect when [...] "pulse pile-up [...] " [...] has occurred, where the apparent anode voltage has moved to a new dc level through the combination of high pulse count and noise. The electronic design of Geiger-Muller counters must be able to detect this situation and give an alarm; it is normally done by setting a threshold for excessive tube current.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{addresses}} the testing at the ONERA (Office National d’Etudes et de Recherches Aérospatiales) crash tower of a sub-cargo demonstrator representative of new generation CFRP (carbon fiber reinforced polymer) commercial aircraft. The project was conducted within a technological platform coordinated by AIRBUS Germany, which aimed at designing, simulating and testing an innovative crashworthy sub-cargo structure. Technical activities were shared between AIRBUS Germany for the demonstrator design and manufacturing, DLR (German Aerospace Center) for {{the numerical analysis}} and ONERA for the crash test. The demonstrator was based on single aisle aircraft geometry and comprised 2 Integrated Cargo Units (ICU) equipped with <b>Triggered</b> <b>Tube</b> Segments (TTS) dedicated to energy absorption and CFRP stringer-stiffened skin. The crash concept {{was based on an}} integrated structural design which applied the “bend-frame-concept” where the cargo cross-beam acts as a bend frame and withstands the dynamic loads introduced by the TTS components. The testing configuration - loading system and instrumentation - was defined on the basis of numerical analysis performed by DLR at the fuselage section level. In that frame, a kinematic model with a 2 -frames typical fuselage section and ICUs involving the “bend-frame” concept was numerically simulated, with the main objective to identify the loading conditions that apply at specific sections, notably those surrounding the ICU-frame coupling areas where the test fixtures were to be implemented. As the outcomes of these numerical works showed that bending/compression loading, at a specific ratio, shall be targeted in priority, the accordingly designed loading system thus consisted of articulated rigs maintaining both ends of the demonstrator. The testing was performed at the ONERA-Lille crash tower at a 6, 7 m/s impact velocity, with a 1050 kg trolley mass. The acquisition system cumulated a total of 48 channels, including force sensors (6), strain gauges (36), displacement laser sensors (5) and an accelerometer (1). Besides, 4 high-speed cameras were implemented to visualize the rupture phenomenon likely to develop during the crash test. Results confirmed the expected crash scenario, with the bending of the cargo cross-beams and the resulting progressive crushing of the TTS components...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{nonionic}} surfactant nonylphenol on the growth and morphologies of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa and the diploid yeast Candida albicans have been examined. Nonylphenol inhibited respiration and growth of N. crassa, effecting a 10 -fold decrease in organism yield at 25 microM. Severe morphological defects were also induced: cell shape was abnormal and apical dominance was lost. Nonylphenol monoethoxylate (the parent compound of nonylphenol) was a less potent growth inhibitor and morphogen. The growth of the yeast form of C. albicans was sensitive to nonylphenol (inducing {{an order of magnitude}} decrease in specific growth rate with a 10 -fold increase in dose concentration) but not nonylphenol monoethoxylate. Similarly, C. albicans ATP content was reduced and glucose-induced extracellular acidification was inhibited only by nonylphenol. Although estrogens may induce the dimorphic transition of C. albicans, nonylphenol (as an environmental estrogen mimic) failed to <b>trigger</b> germ <b>tube</b> formation under nonpermissive conditions and inhibited it under permissive conditions.

40|$|The phloem {{provides}} {{a network of}} sieve tubes for long-distance translocation of photosynthates. For over a century, structural proteins in sieve tubes have presented a conundrum since they presumably increase the hydraulic resist-ance of the tubes while no potential function other than sieve tube or wound sealing {{in the case of}} injury has been suggested. Here we summarize and critically evaluate current speculations regarding the roles of these proteins. Our understanding suffers from the suggestive power of images; what looks like a sieve tube plug on micrographs may not actually impede translocation very much. Recent reports of an involvement of SEOR (sieve element occlusion-related) proteins, a class of P-proteins, in the sealing of injured sieve tubes are inconclusive; various lines of evidence suggest that, in neither intact nor injured plants, are SEORs determinative of translocation stoppage. Similarly, the popular notion that P-proteins serve in the defence against phloem sap-feeding insects is unsupported by empirical facts; it is conceivable that in functional sieve tubes, aphids actually could benefit from inducing a plug. The idea that rising cytosolic Ca 2 + generally <b>triggers</b> sieve <b>tube</b> blockage by P-proteins appears widely accepted, despite lacking experimental support. Even in forisomes, P-protein assemblages restricted to one single plant family and the only Ca 2 +-responsive P-proteins known, the available evidence does not unequivocally suggest that plug formation is the cause rather than a consequence of translocation stoppage.

40|$|Abstract: The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory, {{currently}} being built 4, 100 meters {{above sea level}} on Sierra Negra, Mexico, is a ground-based detector well-suited for observing transient phenomena in the TeV energy range. This is due to its large field of view (2 sr), high up time (> 90 %), and high efficiency for triggering on showers above 1 TeV. However, sub-TeV transient events are of interest due to the overlap in energy with satellite experiments such as the Fermi gamma-ray space telescope. The standard HAWC reconstruction chain will achieve an effective area of 100 m 2 at 100 GeV while rejecting lower multiplicity events in the detector. Triggering on small showers from primaries with energies below 100 GeV is difficult due to {{the large number of}} uncorrelated signals in the detector during the large time window required to accept showers from all arrival directions. To address this problem and augment the sensitivity of HAWC below 100 GeV, we propose a method in which particle arrival directions are fit for triplets of <b>triggered</b> photomultipler <b>tubes</b> (PMTs) in a short sliding trigger window (100 ns). The resulting arrival directions are then summed in a coarsely-binned significance map of the sky with a time window of one to several seconds. This fast algorithm will run online and will be able to localize the positions of transient sources to within 8 ◦. Applying this technique to data from the currently-operational 10 % of the final array allows us to obtain actual noise rates and use them in conjunction with simulations to calculate the sensitivity to transients...|$|R
30|$|Prospective ECG-gating with an axial “step and shoot” {{technique}} {{has been introduced}} to further reduce radiation dose. This technique acquires images in axial mode during a single, short (usually mid-diastolic) interval. The entire heart is acquired {{in one or more}} axial steps (Fig.  7). The prospective gating technique relies on a stable heart rate to predict the time for mid-diastole and to <b>trigger</b> the x-ray <b>tube</b> only during that interval for imaging. Evaluation of cardiac motion is not possible with standard step-and-shoot acquisition since image data are not obtained during the systolic portion of the cardiac cycle. Furthermore, image quality may be adversely impacted if a variable heart rhythm results in image acquisition during a suboptimal phase of the cardiac cycle. Nonetheless, a recent multicenter international study included 685 patients, with 99 patients evaluated using prospective ECG-gating and 586 patients evaluated with a standard helical approach. Mean radiation dose was reduced by 68 %, from 11.2  mSv for the helical mode to 3.6  mSv for the step-and-shoot technique, without loss of image quality [55].|$|R
50|$|The {{distance}} between the fuze and the target is not constant but rather constantly changing due to the high speed of the fuze and any motion of the target. When the {{distance between}} the fuze and the target changes rapidly, then the phase relationship also changes rapidly. The signals are in-phase one instant and out-of-phase a few hundred microseconds later. The result is a heterodyne beat frequency that indicates the velocity difference. Viewed another way, the received signal frequency is doppler shifted from the oscillator frequency by the relative motion of the fuze and target. Consequently, a low frequency signal corresponding to the frequency difference develops at the oscillator's plate terminal. Two additional amplifiers detected and filtered this low frequency signal. If the amplified beat frequency signal is large enough (indicating a nearby object), then it <b>triggers</b> the 4th <b>tube</b> (a gas-filled thyratron); the thyratron conducts a large current that sets off the electrical detonator.

40|$|This {{research}} study aims to manufacture and characterise {{the properties of}} sandwich structures based on natural fibre composites. Bamboo tubes and flax-based composite (reinforced polypropylene and polylactide) were selected as the main materials to be investigated. Initial testing was focused on investigating {{the sensitivity of the}} tensile properties of the composites from various processing conditions and understanding the energy-absorbing characteristics of the individual bamboo tubes. Following this, bamboo honeycomb, bamboo-reinforced foam, corrugated flax-based composites, square and triangular interlocking flax-based composites and corrugated paperboard with flax-based composite skins were manufactured. The flax-based honeycomb and corrugated structures were manufactured using compression moulding techniques and subsequently bonded to skins based on the same material using an epoxy resin. These structures were tested in compression at quasi-static and dynamic rates of strain in order to determine their mechanical strength and specific energy absorption characteristics. It has been shown that the energy-absorbing capacity of the bamboo tubes tends to increase with decreasing inner diameter to the thickness (D/t) ratio. In addition, a chamfered profile was employed to successfully <b>trigger</b> the <b>tubes</b> to fail in a progressive manner. Bamboo tubing has been observed to offer excellent energy absorption characteristics and has potential for use inenergy-absorbing engineering applications. Tests on the flax-based composite structures have shown that the wall thickness and the number of unit cells {{have an effect on the}} strength and energy-absorbing capability of the core. The flax reinforcedpolypropylene (flax/PP) composite structures failed in buckling and fibre fracture, whereasthe flax reinforced polylactide (flax/PLA) systemfailed in buckling with delamination.

Finally, the compression response of the square and triangular honeycomb structures has been modelled using finite element (FE) techniques.

40|$|The {{inoculum}} {{size effect}} in the dimorphic fungus Candida albicans results from production of an extracellular quorum-sensing molecule (QSM). This molecule prevents mycelial development in both a growth morphology assay and a differentiation assay using three chemically distinct <b>triggers</b> for germ <b>tube</b> formation (GTF) : L-proline, N-acetylglucosamine, and serum (either pig or fetal bovine). In all cases, the presence of QSM prevents the yeast-to-mycelium conversion, resulting in actively budding yeasts without influencing cellular growth rates. QSM exhibits general cross-reactivity within C. albicans in that supernatants from strain A 72 are active on five other strains of C. albicans and vice versa. The QSM excreted by C. albicans is farnesol (C 15 H 26 O; molecular weight, 222. 37). QSM is extracellular, and is produced continuously during growth and over a temperature range from 23 to 43 °C, in amounts roughly proportional to the CFU/milliliter. Production is not dependent {{on the type of}} carbon source nor nitrogen source or on the chemical nature of the growth medium. Both commercial mixed isomer and (E,E) -farnesol exhibited QSM activity (the ability to prevent GTF) at a level sufficient to account for all the QSM activity present in C. albicans supernatants, i. e., 50 % GTF at ca. 30 to 35 mM. Nerolidol was ca. two times less active than farnesol. Neither geraniol (C 10), geranylgeraniol (C 20), nor farnesyl pyrophosphate had any QSM activity...|$|R
