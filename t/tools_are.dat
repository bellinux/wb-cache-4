The large cutting {{tools of the}} Acheulian technocomplex become smaller, as more complex <b>tools</b> <b>are</b> better suited towards the needs of highly diversified environments. Composite tools represent {{a new level of}} innovation in their increased efficacy and more complex manufacturing process. The ability to conceptualize beyond the mere reduction of stone cores demonstrates cognitive flexibility, and the use of glue, which was often processed with ochre, to attach flakes to hafts demonstrates an understanding of chemical changes that can be utilized beyond the simple use of color. Adhesives were used to construct hafted tools by 70ka at Sibudu Cave in South Africa.|$|E

50|$|An {{improvement}} on CAT <b>Tooling</b> <b>is</b> BT <b>Tooling,</b> which looks similar and {{can easily be}} confused with CAT tooling. Like CAT Tooling, BT Tooling comes {{in a range of}} sizes and uses the same NMTB body taper. However, BT <b>tooling</b> <b>is</b> symmetrical about the spindle axis, which CAT <b>tooling</b> <b>is</b> not. This gives BT tooling greater stability and balance at high speeds. One other subtle difference between these two toolholders is the thread used to hold the pull stud. CAT <b>Tooling</b> <b>is</b> all Imperial thread and BT <b>Tooling</b> <b>is</b> all Metric thread. Note that this affects the pull stud only, it does not affect the tool that they can hold, both types of <b>tooling</b> <b>are</b> sold to accept both Imperial and metric sized tools.|$|R

5|$|Diagnosis of CSF leak can be {{done through}} various imaging techniques, {{chemical}} tests of bodily fluid discharged from a head orifice, or by a clinical examination. The use of CT, MRI, and assays {{are the most common}} types of CSF leak instrumental tests. Many CSF leaks do not show up on imaging and chemical assays, thus such diagnostic <b>tools</b> <b>are</b> not definitive to rule out CSF leaks. A clinician may often depend upon patient history and exam to diagnose, for example: discharge of excessive amount of clear fluid from the nose upon bending over, the increase in headache following a Valsalva maneuver or the reduction of headache when the patient takes a prone position are positive indicators.|$|E
5000|$|The exact {{origin of}} the claw <b>tool</b> <b>is</b> not well documented, however most in the FDNY agree on its folklorish origin. As the story goes, a fire was started in a lower Manhattan bank in order to {{cover-up}} a burglary. Within the rubble, firefighters found an odd tool with a claw-like end. Upon investigation, {{it was determined that}} the <b>tool</b> <b>was</b> used by the burglars to break into the bank. The firefighters had thought that if the <b>tool</b> <b>was</b> good enough to break into a bank, it was good enough for their use. This unusual <b>tool</b> <b>was</b> labeled [...] "The claw tool". Soon the claw <b>tool</b> <b>was</b> reproduced many times over, and became the primary forcible entry tool used by the FDNY. It is believed that the claw <b>tool</b> <b>was</b> the first <b>tool</b> designed solely for forcible entry.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Sociology, 2005 An {{evaluation}} of the Humboldt County Juvenile Detention Risk Assessment <b>Tool</b> <b>was</b> conducted.

The interview questions focused on the methods in which the probation officers fill out the tool, as well as focusing on the officer???s attitudes toward the <b>tool.</b> It can <b>be</b> concluded from this evaluation that the tool would operate effectively if more uniformity existed in the way in which the <b>tool</b> <b>is</b> filled out.

5|$|It {{has been}} known for some time that St Kilda was {{continuously}} inhabited for two millennia or more, from the Bronze Age to the 20th century. Recently, the first direct evidence of earlier Neolithic settlement emerged—shards of pottery of the Hebridean ware style, found to the east of the village. The subsequent discovery of a quarry for stone tools on Mullach Sgar above Village Bay led to finds of numerous stone hoe-blades, grinders and Skaill knives in the Village Bay cleitean—unique stone storage buildings (see below). These <b>tools</b> <b>are</b> also probably of Neolithic origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of such tools {{has been driven}} by the large amount of genomic and proteomic data available for a variety of organisms, including the human genome. It is simply impossible to study all proteins experimentally, hence only a few are subjected to laboratory experiments while computational <b>tools</b> <b>are</b> used to extrapolate to similar proteins. Such homologous proteins can be efficiently identified in distantly related organisms by sequence alignment. Genome and gene sequences can be searched by a variety of tools for certain properties. Sequence profiling tools can find restriction enzyme sites, open reading frames in nucleotide sequences, and predict secondary structures. Phylogenetic trees can be constructed and evolutionary hypotheses developed using special software like ClustalW regarding the ancestry of modern organisms and the genes they express. The field of bioinformatics is now indispensable for the analysis of genes and proteins.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Aiming at {{the severe}} surface/subsurface damage of Al 2 O 3 ceramic ground by diamond {{grinding}} wheel, the chemical-mechanical grinding (CMG) <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> studied in this paper. According {{to the principle}} of CMG, three types of CMG tools with different abrasives were developed. The chemical compositions of the grinding <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> selected and optimized considering the physicochemical characteristics of Al 2 O 3 ceramic. By comparing the surface roughness and material removal rate (MRR) of Al 2 O 3 ceramic respectively ground with SiO 2, Fe 2 O 3 and MgO grinding tools, the grinding performance of those grinding <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> evaluated. The experiment results showed that the grinding performance of SiO 2 grinding <b>tool</b> <b>was</b> the best. The surface roughness and MRR versus SiO 2 grinding <b>tool</b> <b>were</b> all better than other grinding tools, and can reach 28 nm and 15 µm/h respectively.
