5|$|In 1880, {{the diamond}} {{stingray}} was described twice by <b>three</b> <b>American</b> ichthyologists: as Dasybatus dipterurus by David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert in Proceedings of the United States National Museum, and as Trygon brevis by Samuel Garman in Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Jordan and Gilbert's account {{was published in}} May while Garman's was published in October, making dipterurus (feminine dipterura) the correct name as it was published first. However, when Garman synonymized the two in 1913 he inappropriately gave precedence to brevis, leading to long-standing confusion. Both Dasybatus and Trygon were later synonymized with the genus Dasyatis, but many authors still listed D.brevis in place of or in addition to D.dipterura. Garman also synonymized the Hawaiian stingray (D.hawaiensis) with D.dipterura in 1913, which has since been followed by most authors but requires more study for confirmation.|$|E
5|$|Leucopholiota decorosa is {{a species}} of fungus in the Tricholomataceae family of mushrooms. Commonly known as the {{decorated}} pholiota, it is distinguished by its fruit body which is covered with pointed brown, curved scales on the cap and stem, and by its white gills. Found in the eastern United States, France, and Pakistan, it is saprobic, growing on the decaying wood of hardwood trees. L.decorosa was first described by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck as Agaricus decorosus in 1873, and the species has been transferred to several genera in its history, including Tricholoma, Tricholomopsis, Armillaria, and Floccularia. <b>Three</b> <b>American</b> mycologists considered the species unique enough to warrant its own genus, and transferred it into the new genus Leucopholiota in a 1996 publication. Lookalike species with similar colors and scaly fruit bodies include Pholiota squarrosoides, Phaeomarasmius erinaceellus, and Leucopholiota lignicola. L.decorosa is considered an edible mushroom.|$|E

After the conclusion of hostilities, Duke of York, alongside her sister-ship, King George V, participated in the surrender ceremonies that took place in Tokyo Bay. The following month Duke of York sailed for Hong Kong, to join the fleet that assembled there to accept the surrender of the Japanese garrison. She was the flagship of the British Pacific Fleet when the Japanese surrendered, and remained so until June 1946, when she returned to Plymouth for an overhaul.|$|E
