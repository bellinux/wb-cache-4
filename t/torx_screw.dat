50|$|<b>Torx</b> <b>screws</b> are {{commonly}} found on automobiles, motorcycles, bicycle brake systems (disc brakes), hard disk drives, computer systems and consumer electronics. Initially, they were sometimes used in applications requiring tamper resistance, since the drive systems and screwdrivers were not widely available; as drivers became more common, tamper-resistant variants, as described below, were developed. <b>Torx</b> <b>screws</b> are also becoming increasingly popular in construction industries.|$|R
50|$|The {{subwoofer}} {{and satellite}} speaker are both {{held together with}} <b>Torx</b> #10 <b>screws.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{modified}} version of Torx called Torx TTAP was developed in 2005, which features a second recess to create a [...] "stick-fit" [...] engagement, designed to minimize wobbling {{without the need for}} magnetic bits, a feature that can be important to certain industrial users. Standard Torx drivers can be used to drive TTAP screws, but TTAP drivers will not fit standard <b>Torx</b> <b>screws.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A Torx successor, Torx Plus, was {{introduced}} about 1990 {{when the original}} Torx patent was expiring. The lobes are more square to allow for higher torque and to minimize wear. The name is shortened to IP (Internal Plus) with sizes ranging from 1IP to 100IP [...] (sometimes listed as IP1 to IP100 [...] ) and EP (External Plus) with sizes ranging from 1EP to 42EP as well as smaller sizes ranging from H7EP to H2EP and includes five-lobed tamper-resistant variants. The specifications for these licenses are held by Textron. Standard Torx drivers {{can be used to}} drive <b>Torx</b> Plus <b>screws,</b> but not to full torque because of the loose fit. Torx Plus drivers will not fit into standard <b>Torx</b> <b>screws.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first Apple {{product to}} include pentalobe screws {{internally}} was the Mid 2009 MacBook Pro 15-inch model. Three pentalobe screws {{were used to}} attach the battery to the internal frame. A 1.5 mm flat-blade (slotted) screwdriver could easily remove these screws, which were originally mistaken for 5-point <b>Torx</b> <b>screws.</b> This was the only internal usage of pentalobe screws; all following MacBook Pros use the [...] "Tri-Wing" [...] security bit to attach the battery to the internal frame.|$|R
50|$|Additionally the SE had a Processor Direct Slot {{that allowed}} for {{expansion}} cards, such as accelerators, to be installed. The SE can be upgraded to 50 MHz {{and more than}} 5 MB with the MicroMac accelerators. In the past other accelerators were also available such as the Sonnet Allegro. Since installing a card required opening the computer's case and exposing the user to high voltages from the internal CRT, Apple recommended that only authorized Apple dealers install the cards; the case was sealed with then-uncommon <b>Torx</b> <b>screws.</b>|$|R
50|$|The F3 had two {{internal}} antennas {{to maximize}} reception even when partially shielded by a hand or other obstacles, and a loud maximum volume for ringtones and loudspeaker to facilitate usage in crowded city environments or public transport. The unique default ringing mode vibrates silently for several seconds, then rings at modest volume, then with full volume. A vibrate-only mode and modes with fixed volume {{can also be}} set. To ease repairs or recycling, it can be opened by four <b>Torx</b> <b>screws</b> on the back.|$|R
50|$|The {{first version}} of the shield is made of two pieces. The top is made of metal and serves as {{physical}} protection for the electronics. The other half is mounted on the bottom side of hard drive, and is fastened with a metal hook to the electronics board with two <b>Torx</b> <b>screws.</b> The metal shield covers the electronic circuit and electronic cables leading to the hard disk drive motor and drive head. Below the metal shield, there is a layer of foam, which serves as the actual electrostatic protection.|$|R

5000|$|Swirl flaps {{are small}} {{butterfly}} valves fitted to the intake manifold {{just before the}} cylinder head intake ports of many modern automotive diesel engines, including those from Audi, BMW, Vauxhall and Alfa Romeo. The flaps are smaller than the intake runners and therefore allow air to pass around them even when [...] "closed". The photo shows a cleaned swirl flap removed from the intake manifold of a BMW M47TU 2-litre diesel engine. The flap itself is made from stainless steel and secured to a spindle by two small <b>Torx</b> <b>screws.</b> The sealing O-ring and external actuating lever can be seen below the flap itself.|$|R
50|$|By design, <b>Torx</b> head <b>screws</b> resist cam-out {{better than}} Phillips head or slot head screws. Whereas Phillips heads were {{allegedly}} designed {{to cause the}} driver to cam out, to prevent overtightening, Torx heads were designed to prevent cam-out. The development of better torque-limiting automatic screwdrivers for use in factories allowed this change. Rather than rely on the tool to slip out of the screw head when a desired torque level is reached (which risks damage to the driver tip, screw head, and/or workpiece), torque-limiting driver designs achieve a desired torque consistently.|$|R
5|$|The Benchmade factory {{version was}} sold under the model name BM970 or BM975 {{depending}} on blade length. Other designations followed which denoted blade finish, manual or automatic opening, or partially serrated blade. The knife retained {{the profile of}} Emerson's custom piece {{in addition to the}} ATS-34 steel and the titanium liners. However, on Benchmade's offering the titanium bolsters and micarta scales were replaced with G10 fiberglass scales, the slotted screws were replaced by <b>Torx</b> head <b>screws,</b> and the pocket clip was repositioned so that the knife could be carried in the pocket in a tip-down position.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} now featured aircraft inspired {{details and}} gauges, using both fake and real <b>Torx</b> head <b>screws</b> that fastened the dash and console trim panels. Optional Recaro seats were offered. The 1981, non-Formula 3 spoke steering wheel was re-used and featured a Firebird logo {{mounted in the}} center of the horn pad, with optional leather grip. Many power options could be had. Special Viscount [...] "PMD" [...] bucket seats were optional, featuring a small opening in the headrest and a PMD logo {{in the center of}} the backrest. Leather seats were also available on both the standard seats and Viscount [...] "PMD" [...] seats. A standard locking rear glovebox was mounted on the rear driver"s side of the cargo area and a mini spare tire was hidden behind the opposite panel on the passenger side. A lockable cargo door on the rear floor area and a retractable cargo area privacy shade were also available as options on all Firebirds.|$|R

This is an external temperature control system and can be replaced by any system you may have available. Extruder calibration To ensure the stepper movement translates into the piston movement accordingly to the g-code, it needs to be calibrated properly. Calibration set-up In principle, the calibration set-up requires: CNC control of the piston powering motor (we use Nema 11 with a planetary reductor) the assembled extruder (at least the moving parts) a precise displacement measurement device (calipers, etc., high precision indicators are preferrable) The calibration protocol requires a set-up, where the piston translation, can be precisely measured in the axis of extrusion. For this purpose, the measurement device is fixed on the extruder in a way, that the extruder movement is translated directly into the measurement. Calibration procedure adjust the steps/unit value of the motor settings in the cnc control software (or use default values) command piston movement for an exact distance measure the real movement distance and compare repeat steps 1 - 3, until the g-code value coincides with the measured value For a Nema 11 motor (with a planetary reductor) + an M 5 spindle (0. 5 mm pitch/rotation), the default STEPS/UNIT value is 37914. 30. Thermistor calibration Every thermistor analog output values have to be mapped to actual temperature values via an equation. Every thermistor needs to be calibrated as described in this section. EQUIPMENT: thermo block/plate (heat source), alcochol thermometer, thermistor, setup for reading analog signal from the thermistor, oil, glass. pour a small glass of oil (50 mL or so) place the glass on the heat source fit a thermistor to the alcochol thermometer sink the thermistor - thermometer setup into the glass with oil prepare the system to read analog values turn on the heat source and record sensor analog output at every 1 °C increment plot data (x - axis: analog output, y-axis: real temperature) fit the best trendline to the data obtained (MATLAB or EXCEL are good tools for completing this task but there are also others) software will yield a fit line equation which then has to be transcribed into microcontroller firmware (we used Arduino Mega) Now your thermistor will give out the right temperature values. step_vitaprint. zi...|$|R
