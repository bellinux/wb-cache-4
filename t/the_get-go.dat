25|$|The Ravens opened Week 2 with a home-opener {{against the}} visiting Oakland Raiders. From <b>the</b> <b>get-go,</b> the Ravens {{dominated}} the game. The Ravens forced two fumbles by Oakland QB Aaron Brooks {{in the first}} quarter which led to two of Baltimore kicker's Matt Stover three field goals (25, 33, and 37-yarders). The Raiders would get on the board in the second quarter with a 34-yard field goal by opposing Sebastian Janikowski, but Baltimore would respond with QB Steve McNair completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to TE Todd Heap. In the third quarter, the only score of the period would be LB Adalius Thomas sacking QB Andrew Walter in the end zone for a safety. In the fourth quarter, Stover increased the Ravens' lead with a 23-yard field goal. Even though Oakland would get three points on Janikowski's 51-yard FG, Baltimore RB Mike Anderson put the game away on a 34-yard TD run. With another win, the Ravens advanced to 2–0.|$|E
25|$|Pierce was {{selected}} with the 10th overall pick in 1998 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics, a team he despised growing up. A starter from <b>the</b> <b>get-go,</b> he scored 19 or more points in 10 {{of his first}} 11 contests, and {{was on his way}} to being one of the best young players in the game. For the year, he averaged 16.5 points and finished third in the voting for Rookie of the Year honors. In his second season, he raised his scoring average to 19.5 points per game, and was turning into one of the elite offensive players in the NBA. By his third season in the league, Pierce was ready for a breakout year. In the 2000–01 season, Pierce appeared in 82 games (all starts), averaging 25.3 points, 6.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.68 steals in 38.0 minutes. He led the Celtics and finished eighth in the league in points per game, fourth in total points (2,071). He was named NBA Player of the Month for March 2001 after averaging 30.3 points, 7.2 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 1.60 steals for the month.|$|E

500|$|Chamber pop {{was part}} of a larger trend which {{involved}} musicians who rejected traditional rock conventions, such as Tortoise and Stereolab, although those specific bands are not considered ork-pop. [...] The genre's orchestration is typically more complex than rock music, making extensive use of brass and strings. It drew from the 1990s lounge music revival but avoided any influence from other contemporary styles like grunge, electronica, or alternative music, particularly the lo-fi hiss and distortion of the last. Although modern rock groups like Smashing Pumpkins, Oasis, and R.E.M. occasionally used strings, their approach was considerably less intricate. The High Llamas were one of the first to anticipate the easy-listening fad with their 1993 debut album Gideon Gaye. O'Hagan felt that [...] "There is this whole misconception that American college rock with twisted baseball hats and checked shirts is adventurous, but it's the most conformist, corporate thing out there.... All these bands sound like Nirvana and Pearl Jam. It's a shame that it couldn't be discovered from <b>the</b> <b>get-go</b> for what it is. A lot of it is just very simple dumb-guy rock." ...|$|E

[...] "From <b>the</b> <b>get-go,</b> we were committed to designing it top to bottom. Let's get the architectural style, clothing, heritage, customs, how they would sleep, and how they would speak. So we brought people on board who would help us develop those ideas." [...] Art director David Goetz stated, [...] "We looked at Mayan architecture, styles of ancient, unusual architecture {{from around the world}}, and the directors really liked the look of Southeast Asian architecture." [...] The team later took ideas from other architectural forms, including Cambodian, Indian, and Tibetan works. Hahn added, [...] "If you take and deconstruct architecture from around the world into one architectural vocabulary, that's what our Atlantis looks like." [...] The overall design and circular layout of Atlantis were also based on the writings of Plato, and his quote [...] "in a single day and night of misfortune, the island of Atlantis disappeared into the depths of the sea" [...] was influential from the beginning of production. The crew wore T-shirts which read [...] "ATLANTIS—Fewer songs, more explosions" [...] due the film's plan as an action-adventure (unlike previous Disney animated features, which were musicals).|$|E

On the character's [...] "Jewish ties", Kauffman told j. that Rachel had always been Jewish [...] "in our minds", explaining, [...] "You can’t create a character with the name 'Rachel Green' and not from <b>the</b> <b>get-go</b> make some character choices". Prior to this, critics and fans had long speculated whether or not Rachel is Jewish; there are entire websites entirely devoted to discussing this. Vulture's Lindsey Weber, who identifies herself as Jewish, observed several similarities and Jewish stereotypes she shares with the character, citing the facts that Rachel refers to her grandmother Ida Green as [...] "Bubbe", Long Island origin, and engagement to a Jewish doctor as allusions to the character's Jewish culture. In her book Changed for Good: A Feminist History of the Broadway Musical, author Stacy Wolf identified Rachel as one of several popular female television characters who embodied Jewish stereotypes during the 1990s and often served as [...] "the butt of the shows' jokes." [...] Meanwhile, JDate's Rebecca Frankel cited Rachel as one of the earliest and most prominent examples of the Jewish American Princess stereotype on screen. Writing for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Alicia R. Korenman also acknowledged Rachel's initial Jewish American Princess qualities, describing her as [...] "spoiled, dependent on her father's money and her fiance's, is horrified at the thought of working for a living and generally inept in her attempts to do so, and is eventually revealed to have had a nose job", which she eventually overcomes as they become less [...] "evident in later seasons of the show". In his article [...] "Princesses, Schlemiels, Punishers and Overbearing Mothers", Evan Cooper described Rachel as a [...] "de-semitized" [...] Jew because, aside from her name, [...] "there is never any discussion of experiences of growing up in a Jewish culture, no use of Yiddish, and few, if any, references to family members with distinctively Jewish surnames". Cooper continued to write that although Rachel possesses some Jewish American Princess traits, she is more similar to the [...] "little woman" [...] stereotype. The New York Post's Robert Rorke labeled Rachel [...] "a rehabilitated Jewish American Princess", in contrast to her sister Amy (Christina Applegate) who remains [...] "selfish, condescending and narcissistic." ...|$|E

When we recorded later in 2008, we did some more of my songs, but Frank wasn't there for that. We tried to recreate that unique Frank sound. I'd like to think of these as songs that if the Descendents had stayed together, this is what we would have sounded like. Those are in Bill's hands.

2500|$|Philosopher and {{ecologist}} David Abram articulates and elaborates {{a form of}} hylozoism {{grounded in}} the phenomenology of sensory experience. In his books Becoming Animal and The Spell of the Sensuous, Abram suggests that matter is never entirely passive in our direct experience, holding rather that material things actively [...] "solicit our attention" [...] or [...] "call our focus," [...] coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. In the absence of intervening technologies, sensory experience is inherently animistic, disclosing a material field that is animate and self-organizing from <b>the</b> <b>get-go.</b> Drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science {{as well as the}} perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous, oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology, in which matter is alive through and through. Such an ontology is in close accord, he suggests, with our spontaneous perceptual experience; it calls us back to our senses and to the primacy of the sensuous terrain, [...] enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters and weather-patterns that materially sustains us.|$|E

[...] In the third quarter, things started to get ugly for St. Louis as Chargers free safety Marlon McCree {{returned}} a fumble 79 yards for a touchdown. The Rams responded with kicker Jeff Wilkins nailing a 34-yard field goal, yet Chargers kicker Nate Kaeding made a 31-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, it was {{back and forth with}} touchdowns.

One of the unique products of this series, female turtle Venus, is notorious for becoming one of the additions to the franchise that Laird most despises. However, he took a more active role in the next TMNT animated venture, acting as [...] "a consultant, and... working with the guy I consider the head writer, Lloyd Goldfine." [...] In this role, he says [...] "rom <b>the</b> <b>get-go</b> I've been looking at everything, from day one.

2500|$|In late 2013 U.S. President Barack Obama made {{recommendations}} to the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues {{as part of his}} $100 million Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative.

[...] But no consensus has been reached. Miguel Faria, a Professor of Neurosurgery and an Associate Editor in Chief of Surgical Neurology International, who was not involved in the Commission's work said, [...] "any ethics approach must be based upon respect for the individual, as doctors pledge according to the Hippocratic Oath which includes vows to be humble, respect privacy and doing no harm; and pursuing a path based on population-based ethics is just as dangerous as having no medical ethics at all". Why the danger of population-based bioethics? Faria asserts, [...] "it is centered on utilitarianism, monetary considerations, and the fiscal and political interests of the state, rather than committed to placing the interest of the individual patient or experimental subject above all other considerations". For her part, Gutmann [...] believes the next step is [...] "to examine more deeply the ethical implications of neuroscience research and its effects on society".|$|E
2500|$|AllMusic {{retrospectively}} {{reviewed the}} album and said: [...] "Nobody's Fools has some really great songs on it, but {{all things considered}} it was the band's worst album at that point. Basically misguided from <b>the</b> <b>get-go,</b> Nobody's Fools is constantly trying to free itself from the oppressive production and arrangements. For the fan, this album is worth it for several of the tunes. For the uninitiated, skip this one - all in all, it's not one of their best." [...] In 2010, Classic Rock considered the album [...] "worth exploring" [...] and wrote: [...] "A surprisingly slick-sounding album, the singles [...] "In for a Penny" [...] and [...] "Let's Call It Quits" [...] are among its most immediate moments." [...] Colin Harper of Record Collector said: [...] "Having maintained their UK singles successes with the standalone [...] "Thanks for the Memory" [...] and top-drawer trailers for the album [...] "In for a Penny" [...] and [...] "Let's Call It Quits" [...] (all three imaginatively moving on from their big-chorus boot- stompers of 1972/73), Nobody's Fools, was to end their 17-song run of hits. Funk-rock album track [...] "Do the Dirty" [...] {{might have been a}} better choice, while [...] "Get on Up" [...] (similarly American-influenced, albeit exploding to better effect on 1978's Slade Alive II) proved they could rock stadiums with the best.

2500|$|Cultural {{ecologist}} and philosopher David Abram articulates and elaborates {{an intensely}} ethical and ecological form of animism {{grounded in the}} phenomenology of sensory experience. In his books Becoming Animal and The Spell of the Sensuous, Abram suggests that material things are never entirely passive in our direct experience, holding rather that perceived things actively [...] "solicit our attention" [...] or [...] "call our focus," [...] coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. In the absence of intervening technologies, sensory experience is inherently animistic, disclosing a material field that is animate and self-organizing from <b>the</b> <b>get-go.</b> Drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science, as well as upon the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous, oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology, in which matter is alive through and through.

[...] In contrast to a long-standing tendency in the Western social sciences, which commonly provide rational explanations of animistic experience, Abram develops an animistic account of reason itself. He holds that civilized reason is sustained only by an intensely animistic participation between human beings and their own written signs. Indeed, as soon as we turn our gaze toward the alphabetic letters written on a page or a screen, these letters speak to us—we 'see what they say'—much as ancient trees and gushing streams and lichen-encrusted boulders once spoke to our oral ancestors. Hence reading is an intensely concentrated form of animism, one that effectively eclipses all of the other, older, more spontaneous forms of participation in which we once engaged. [...] "To tell the story in this manner—to provide an animistic account of reason, {{rather than the other way}} around—is to imply that animism is the wider and more inclusive term, and that oral, mimetic modes of experience still underlie, and support, all our literate and technological modes of reflection. When reflection's rootedness in such bodily, participatory modes of experience is entirely unacknowledged or unconscious, reflective reason becomes dysfunctional, unintentionally destroying the corporeal, sensuous world that sustains it." ...|$|E
