Additional {{information about the}} sign and extent of the externality associated with <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> becomes available only once a private party undertakes <b>the</b> <b>activity,</b> but undoing <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> at that stage is costly. We characterize when the regulator should commit not to reevaluate <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> ex post. <b>The</b> case for ex post regulation is strengthened if the private party can signal its private information {{about the consequences of}} <b>the</b> <b>activity,</b> but it is weakened if the cost of undoing <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> can be manipulated...|$|R

5|$|Austerlitz and the {{subsequent}} Treaty of Pressburg in 1805 indicated that the Austrian army needed reform. Napoleon had offered Charles the Austrian throne after Austerlitz, an act that aroused deep suspicion from Charles' brother, Austrian emperor Francis II. Even though Charles was allowed to spearhead the reforms of the Austrian army, Francis kept the Hofkriegsrat (Aulic Council), a military advisory board, to oversee <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> of Charles as supreme commander.|$|E
5|$|Because {{a number}} {{of the members of the}} Round Table had regular {{newspaper}} columns, <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> and quips of various Round Table members were reported in the national press. This brought Round Tablers widely into the public consciousness as renowned wits.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{attempted to}} find out how the characteristics of outdoor activities carried out with the mobile phone influence students' emotions. The research findings point at the following components related to <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> as influencing students' emotions: <b>The</b> <b>activity</b> novelty, <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> theme (related to everyday life, related to a new subject related to the students themselves or to an issue or a subject that the students like to do, etc.), <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> conditions (its physical part is easy/uneasy to perform, resources are available, etc.), the outer environment conditions (hot, warm, cold, etc.), the roles which <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> enables (these roles may or may not satisfy a student), the learning method enabled in <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> (exploring mathematical ideas independently, exploring mathematics collaboratively, etc.), the challenge or competition associated with <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> (it needs persistence, attention, etc.). These components show that taking care of students' leaning emotions in outdoor mathematical activities can be achieved through paying attention to different aspects of <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> which are outlined above...|$|R

30|$|We {{found that}} all of the 39 {{responses}} suggest that <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> was helpful in learning and creating interest. Students predominantly perceived that <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> was helpful to learning due to the following reasons: (a) <b>The</b> <b>activity</b> helped them to clarify their muddy points and learning basic details. (b) Due to <b>the</b> <b>activity,</b> students came across critical questions. (c) <b>The</b> <b>activity</b> covers all necessary topics. (d) It was better to explore topics more from students point of view. (e) It removed fear and hesitation of participating in the class, and increased active learning. The disadvantage of <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> as perceived by the students was that <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> was very much time-consuming. It would be interesting to study in our future research how much time does the traditional lecture require as compared to the time required by the SQDL approach to cover the same set of topics.|$|R
40|$|College {{students}} in two sections {{of a general}} psychology course participated in a demonstration of a simple neural circuit. <b>The</b> <b>activity</b> {{was based on a}} neural circuit that Jeffress proposed for localizing sounds. Students in one section responded to a questionnaire prior to participating in <b>the</b> <b>activity,</b> while {{students in}} the other section responded to the questionnaire after participating in <b>the</b> <b>activity.</b> Students who had participated in <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> reported greater understanding of the concept of a neural circuit and of how the brain can produce complex behavior. <b>The</b> <b>activity</b> may be a useful addition to previously published class simulations on neural functioning.

5|$|Differences in {{architectural}} style between elite residential complexes and in <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> {{carried out at}} them suggest that the aristocracy of Motul de San José was divided into several distinct classes, including the royal family resident in Group C, royal courtiers and low to middle rank nobles.|$|E
30|$|Regarding {{perceived}} barriers for {{the development}} of <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> and possible improvements, students and teachers indicated that one of the major difficulties in the development of <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> was <b>the</b> shortage of MOOCs in subjects related to education in Spanish, which could be analyzed while <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> was being developed (October, November and December 2014). Teachers also stressed the need for both <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>the</b> project as a whole to have more visibility in the curriculum and for the role of students to be more active, including being present during the design stage of <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> (Interview Teacher 3).|$|R
40|$|An {{economic}} activity interacts with an endangered species. <b>The</b> <b>activity</b> {{can be divided}} into mutually exclusive strata with different levels of inter- action. Observing <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> in order to monitor interactions is costly. It may be desirable to manage <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> with a probability model which balances the benefit from <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> against <b>the</b> cost of the interaction with the endangered specie instead. The model gives rise to a permit scheme which fixates the risk of interaction over all strata and which uses the market mechanism to optimally allocate <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> between strata. <b>The</b> model can facilitate uncertainty in interaction rate estimates...|$|R
30|$|The {{criteria}} of passion for one’s studies were assessed by five items (α =  0.84), referring to {{time spent on}} <b>the</b> <b>activity,</b> liking <b>the</b> <b>activity,</b> valuing <b>the</b> <b>activity,</b> as well as passion and identity, respectively (see Table  5 in “Appendix” for {{the wording of the}} Passion Criteria).|$|R
5|$|Fairley {{returned}} to the Australian Army during the Second World War as Director of Medicine. He {{played an important role}} in the planning for the Battle of Greece, convincing the British Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Archibald Wavell to alter his campaign plan to reduce the danger from malaria. In the South West Pacific Area, Fairley became responsible for co-ordinating <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> of all allied forces in the fight against malaria and other tropical diseases. Fairley again sounded the alarm on the dangers of malaria, persuading authorities in the United States and United Kingdom to greatly step up production of anti-malarial drugs. Through <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> of the LHQ Medical Research Unit, he fast-tracked research into new drugs. Fairley convinced the Army of the efficacy of the new drug atebrin, and persuaded commanders to adopt a tough approach to administering the drug to the troops.|$|E

30|$|For all {{normal tissues}} except the spleen (with priming) and adrenals (without priming), <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> {{concentration}} decreased with time. <b>The</b> <b>activity</b> concentration after administration without priming had an initial higher uptake in the kidneys, liver, and spleen, but <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> concentration decreased faster {{than in the}} priming group to the last time point measured. In the pancreas and lungs, <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> concentration decreased with time for both groups but was higher when using priming.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>activity</b> of <b>the</b> three pipistrelles P. nathusii, P. pipistrellus, and P. pygmaeus was {{affected}} by similar landscape characteristics on similar spatial scales, however partially in opposite ways (Fig.  2). For instance, {{the amount of water}} cover and the density of kettle holes were associated positively with <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of P. pygmaeus, while the kettle hole density was negatively associated with <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of P. pipistrellus. Also, <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of P. pipistrellus was positively associated with built-up areas, which were negatively related to <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of P. pygmaeus. In addition, we found a positive effect of the percentage of woody vegetation cover on <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of P. pipistrellus above farmland. Interestingly, <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of P. nathusii was positively associated with the amount of water cover on the scale of 1  km which was also the case for P. pygmaeus and for N. noctula, however on a larger spatial scale and in interaction with the season.|$|R
