5000|$|The o'nyong'nyong virus (ONNV) {{was first}} {{isolated}} {{by researchers at}} the Uganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe, Uganda, during a large outbreak of a disease in 1959 that resembled dengue fever. [...] ONNV is a <b>togavirus</b> (family Togaviridae), genus Alphavirus, is closely related to the chikungunya and Igbo Ora viruses, {{and is a member of}} the Semliki Forest antigenic complex. The name was given to the disease by the Acholi tribe during the 1959 outbreak. The name comes from the Nilotic language of Uganda and Sudan and means “weakening of the joints". The virus can infect humans and may cause disease.|$|E
50|$|The causative agent, later {{identified}} as a <b>togavirus</b> was first isolated from infected horse brains in 1933. In 1938, the first confirmed human cases were identified when thirty children died of encephalitis in the northeastern United States. These cases coincided with outbreaks in horses in the same regions. The fatality rate in humans is 33% and there is currently no cure for human infections. This virus has four variations in the types in lineage. The most common to the human disease is Group 1 which {{is considered to be}} endemic in North American and the Caribbean while the other three lineages, Group IIA, IIB, and III are typically found in Central and Southern America causing equine illness.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vertebrate}} {{hosts of}} the virus were primarily monkeys in a so-called enzootic mosquito-monkey-mosquito cycle, with only occasional transmission to humans. Before the current pandemic began in 2007, Zika [...] "rarely caused recognized 'spillover' infections in humans, even in highly enzootic areas". Infrequently, however, other arboviruses have become established as a human disease and spread in a mosquito-human-mosquito cycle, like the yellow fever virus and the dengue fever virus (both flaviviruses), and the chikungunya virus (a <b>togavirus).</b> [...] Though {{the reason for the}} pandemic is unknown, dengue, a related arbovirus that infects the same species of mosquito vectors, is known in particular to be intensified by urbanization and globalization. Zika is primarily spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, and can also be transmitted through sexual contact or blood transfusions. The basic reproduction number (R0, a measure of transmissibility) of Zika virus has been estimated to be between 1.4 and 6.6.|$|E

40|$|A {{comparative}} study {{of the growth of}} Sindbis (SIN) virus, a group A arbovirus (<b>togavirus),</b> and Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, a representative group B arbovirus (<b>togavirus),</b> was conducted in enucleate and nucleate cells. Immunofluorescent tests and yield measurements demonstrated that chicken embryo cells which had been enucleated and subsequently infected with SIN virus produced virus-specific antigens and infectious virus. By contrast, JE failed to replicate or produce virus-specific antigen in cells which had been enucleated before or even 2 h post infection. Studies of the effect of enulceation at various times after infection demonstrated that a nucleus must be present at least 2 and possibly as long as 4 h after infection to produce either JE-specific antigen or infectious JE virus.

40|$|Electron {{microscopic}} examination of 57 ocular melanomas (54 human, two feline and one canine) revealed {{the presence of}} viral particles in six specimens. Herpesviruses particles were observed in one human specimen and were passed in human fibroblasts (WI- 38), where they gave rise to intranuclear inclusions. A-type oncornavirus particles (oncogenic RNA virus) were observed in a second case, both in cells of tumor directly removed from an enucleated eye {{as well as in}} cells grown in tissue culture. In three human specimens and one feline specimen, <b>togavirus</b> particles were observed. Rubella is a member of this group, and the possibility that the presence of <b>togavirus</b> in these tumors is the result of latent ocular infection by rubella virus is raised. Herpes virus and RNA tumor viruses are widely considered as having a possible etiologic role for certain human cancers. The observation of <b>togavirus</b> is unexpected, as this virus has not been previously implicated in human or animal tumors. Injection of an RNA tumor virus (Gardner strain feline sarcoma virus) into the anterior chamber of newborn kittens resulted in the development of iris and ciliary body melanomas, many of which showed invasion and, in one instance, metastasis. This is the first animal model of a viral-induced uveal melanoma, and the histology and ultrastructure are described. These results emphasize the need for the continued investigation of the role of these viruses in uveal melanoma...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid microplaque assay for Sindbis virus was {{developed}} which uses microtiter plates and overlay medium consisting of methylcellulose and specific antibody to Sindbis virus.

The microplaque assay could be accurately applied to measuring interferon activity, particularly at low interferon levels.

40|$|After {{immunization}} with Sindbis virus, T-cell deficient nude mice, {{compared to}} normal littermates, were equally protected against challenge with Sindbis virus.

Other possible compen-satory mechanisms to explain the low level of specific cross protection in nude mice are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Haemagglutination {{inhibition}} (HI) {{activity was}} assayed by the micro and macro methods in immune sera prepared against four <b>togaviruses.</b> HI titres were always 4 to 8 times lower by the micro method, and coincided with 4 to 8 times lower haemagglutinin titres in micro method assays. Because of this phenomenon, positive sera with HI macro method titres lower than 1 : 80 will be false negative for HI by the micro method when tests begin at a 1 : 10 serum dilution. This was confirmed {{for a number}} of human sera tested for West Nile virus HI activity. As a consequence of the difference between titres given by the two assay methods, results of seroepidemiological studies may be distorted.

40|$|The name rubella {{is derived}} from Latin, meaning “little red. ” Rubella was {{initially}} {{considered to be a}} variant of measles or scarlet fever and was called “third disease. ” It was not until 1814 that it was first described as a separate disease in the German medical literature, hence the common name “German measles. ” In 1914, Hess postulated a viral etiology based on his work with monkeys. Hiro and Tosaka in 1938 confirmed the viral etiology by passing the disease to children using filtered nasal washings from persons with acute cases. Following a widespread epidemic of rubella infection in 1940, Norman Gregg, an Australian ophthalmologist, reported in 1941 the occurrence of congenital cataracts among 78 infants born following maternal rubella infection in early pregnancy. This was the first published recognition of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Rubella virus was first isolated in 1962 by Parkman and Weller. The first rubella vaccines were licensed in 1969. Rubella Virus Rubella virus is classified as a <b>togavirus,</b> genus Rubivirus. It is most closely related to group A arboviruses, such as eastern and western equine encephalitis viruses.

The genome encodes four non-structural proteins at the 5' end and the capsid and two envelope proteins at the 3' end. This is characteristic of all <b>Togaviruses.</b> Replication is cytoplasmic and rapid. The genomic RNA is partially translated at the 5’ end to produce the non-structural proteins which are then involved in genome replication {{and the production of}} new genomic RNA and a shorter sub-genomic RNA strand.
