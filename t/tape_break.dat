40|$|The crack {{formation}} in filaments of multi-filamentary Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 Ox tapes as function of applied longitudinal strain is visualized {{by means of}} magneto-optical imaging. Strain is applied at the desired temperature inside a helium flow cryostat. Cracks form transverse to the current carrying direction of the filaments. Before the <b>tape</b> <b>breaks</b> entirely, all filaments have formed {{a large number of}} transverse cracks, spaced with an average crack distance of ≈ 200 μm. The {{crack formation}} is compared with the degradation of the critical current {{as a function of the}} applied strain. The critical current degrades already before the first crack is observed. This is explained by the limited number of filaments visible in the experiment...|$|R

40|$|A {{good deal}} of work carried out in recent past {{has shown that the}} triboelectromagnetic {{radiation}} produced during peeling of a scotch <b>tape,</b> <b>breaking</b> rock sugar with a hammer, peeling of mica sheets etc. may extend even to X-ray energies. Work on peeling of scotch tape has been particularly successful in demonstrating visible X-ray emission in modest vacuum. The present work looks at the possibility of X-ray emission during rubbing of metals and other selected material pairs in air. Experimental results indicate that X-ray emission indeed occurs during rubbing of even common engineering metals and also other selected material pairs under certain restricted rubbing configurations. It was observed that X-rays could be detected when one of the rubbing surfaces was a thin metal sheet. It was also observed that with the increase in sliding speed X-ray emission increased whereas the increase in load did not have much influence on the emission. Vibration at the contact was found to be an important influential parameter. With the increasing vibration X-ray emission increased. This X-ray emission at the rubbing contact between common engineering materials, if exploited properly, can be of significant use in in-situ monitoring of tribological processes...|$|R

After moving he then almost broke the tapes once before coming forward again, this time actually falling over his handlebars and onto the track as he tried to stop his bike which had actually rolled over the <b>tapes</b> (without <b>breaking</b> them), leaving Australian referee Sam Bass no option but to exclude him from the race.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} a culture-specific videotape {{on how to}} 'break bad news' and another videotape produced by a western university, and {{to determine if the}} language of presentation influenced the students' perceived abilities to execute basic skills. SUBJECTS: Third year medical students at the Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong. DESIGN: Longitudinal study with experimental design. INTERVENTION: Two instructional <b>tapes</b> on <b>breaking</b> bad news; one using Chinese speaking role models and one using English. RESULTS: In both groups, self-efficacy summed scores increased from 26. 8 (95 % CI = 25. 9 - 27. 7) at the pre-test to 29. 0 (95 % CI = 28. 4 - 29. 6). The biggest changes occurred in perceived self-efficacy regarding specific skills. However, students using the Chinese tape rated skills as more useful than those using the English tape. CONCLUSION: The videotapes were useful in teaching communication skills. Culturally relevant audiovisual materials were more effective. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|High Performance {{polymeric}} materials are {{a subject of}} considerable interest due to their high mechanical performances when combined with their versatility in processing and synthesis. In order to achieve high mechanical properties, scientist focuses on increasing the molecular weight of the polymer produced. A striking example is polyethylene. When having a molar mass of approximately 10 ^ 3 - 10 ^ 4 g/mol, it is soft a material and it is used for films and packaging; when the molecular weight increases over 10 ^ 6 g/mol (also called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene - UHMWPE) it becomes extremely hard and it is used in ballistic and in high modulus/high strength applications. However, on increasing the molecular weight, also the viscosity increases due to {{the large number of}} entanglements in the non-crystalline region of the semi-crystalline material. The current state-of-the-art in processing this material is by partial dissolution of a small amount of polymer (~ 5 - 10 wt. %) in organic solvents {{in order to reduce the}} entanglements [1]. A recent development in the processing of the UHMWPE is achieved by direct synthesis of the polymer having a reduced amount of entanglements. By tailoring the reaction conditions during synthesis and making a meticulous choice of the catalytic system, it is possible to synthesise disentangled-UHMWPE. The disentangled-UHMWPE can be uniaxial as well as biaxial solid-state processing without using any solvent. The resulting solid-state processed <b>tapes</b> have unprecedented <b>breaking</b> tenacity (> 4. 0 GPa) and tensile modulus (> 200 Gpa) [2]. The fundamental concept of processing lower entangled high molecular weight polymers is of general nature and can be potentially applied for all the {{polymeric materials}}. The current research activity is focusing on testing different catalytic systems for the synthesis of the first solid-state processed biobased tapes and/or fibres for high breaking tenacity and high modulus applications...|$|R

But when Tanja {{finds out that}} Ludwig recorded her shooting Sebastian and he knew about Ludwig's plan to eventually blackmail her with the <b>tapes,</b> Tanja <b>breaks</b> things off with Sebastian. He tries to explain {{that he wanted to}} destroy the recording, but Tanja has lost her trust in him. She decides to take a vacation and leaves for Paris. Tanja then plans a photo shooting for her new campaign in Palma de Mallorca. Oliver Sabel, who's the male model of the campaign, tries to prevent the photo shooting from happing as he knows that Tanja's enemy Clarissa is still alive and after ten years of prison, now lives on the Spanish island to reconnect with her children Jan and Julia, who live there as well. Olli can't prevent the photo shooting from happing, but at least Tanja doesn't find out about Clarissa being alive. The other way around, Clarissa is shocked as she sees Tanja from a distance; believing that Tanja died in that plane crash in 2001.Back in Düsseldorf, Tanja wants Sebastian to sign some papers with whom he would play no role in his child's life. Sebastian is shocked about Tanja's plans to leave town and start a new life in New York. Sure that Tanja's feelings for him will eventually get the upper hand, Sebastian signs the papers as prove of his love for her. In the next couple of weeks, Sebastian tries everything to win Tanja back. But she's too afraid of being hurt again and even after Sebastian and Tanja witness an ultrasound of their baby's heartbeat and find out that they will have a daughter; Tanja moves on with her plans to go to New York. Sebastian realizes that he lost her and tells Tanja that he's done trying to win her back. When she already packed her things for New York and is about to leave, Tanja realizes that she has to risk something for love and finally returns into Sebastian's arms. The two want to get married as soon as possible, but as another scandal has hit the Lahnstein family the couple decide to have a small wedding with just the two of them.Tanja and Sebastian want to get married on Mallorca, which leads to Olli warning Charlie, who's visiting Clarissa. While Charlie tries to get Clarissa to spend a few days on a spa with her in Madrid, Sebastian and Tanja give their religious confessions to a priest in order to get married. Tanja is shocked as the priest turns out to be her former lover Jan. Reminding Tanja about their past, Jan doesn't want to marry the couple as he doesn't believe that Tanja could ever really love somebody. Tanja then proves Jan wrong as she finally confesses her love to Sebastian for the very first - and in her words the only - time. After seeing that Tanja and Sebastian really love each other, Jan agrees to marry the couple. They then have another problem as they need witnesses to a marriage in Spain. Realizing that Charlie is in Palma, apparently visiting Julia, Tanja is asking her to be her Matron of honor. Charlie as a laugh but then agrees as she wants Tanja to leave the island as soon as possible. For the very same reason, Julia is in on the wedding too as Sebastian's [...] "best man". Sebastian notices some tension between Julia and Tanja and asks his bride about their past. Tanja is confessing - {{for the first time ever}} - that Julia was once married to a man named Tim Sander, who later had a girlfriend named Cleo Winter. She tells him that she did something horrible to Cleo and that Tim, with the help of Clarissa, ended up kidnapping her and held her hostage for three years in the basement. Sebastian is horrified for Tanja as she lets him know that she murdered Tim as soon as she could free herself. Sebastian is shocked and Tanja even lets him know that it's okay if he can't marry her anymore. But Sebastian tells Tanja that he loves her and that all that is in the past. In the meantime, Clarissa found out that Tanja is back and wants to get married on Mallorca. In order to stop her mother, Julia sees no other way but to lock Clarissa up in her room. Anyway, Clarissa makes it to the wedding in time, but hides out and witnesses how Tanja and Sebastian exchange their [...] "I dos". Tanja and Sebastian leave the island happily married as Clarissa makes plans to how get her company back out of Tanja's hands.|$|R
