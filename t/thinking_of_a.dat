In fact, the show's creators made Sara Sidle while <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> future love interest for Grissom, but during the show's first three seasons, Grissom flirted with all the female characters, and when Sara asked him out to dinner, he rejected her, claiming {{that he did not}} know what to do about what is going on between them.|$|E

When the thought of a scene with the three major characters dancing in the dunes came up, he realized that an older character could not realistically dance in the desert. He immediately felt that Shreyas Talpade, whom he knew of knowing mimicry, could be used for bahuroopiya. Kukunoor, who worked previously with Girish Karnad, said that he was the strength for the film and added that he found him a good actor and a good human being.|$|E

25|$|Young Anastasiya Vertinskaya was <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{career in}} linguistics, but things changed {{overnight}} in 1961 when the then sixteen-year-old was approached personally {{by the film}} director Aleksandr Ptushko {{for the role of}} Assol in Scarlet Sails. The romantic teenage drama based on Alexander Grin's novel became an instant success, making Anastasiya a national celebrity. Many of the future stars of Soviet cinema, including Vasily Lanovoy, Ivan Pereverzev, Sergey Martinson, and Oleg Anofriev, were in the cast, but, as critics noted, it was Vertinskaya's passionate performance that gave Scarlet Sails its flavour. 23 million people viewed the film during its first year.|$|E

Fisher noticed how dangerous and ill-suited the makeshift courses were for racing and testing. He also argued that spectators did not get their money's worth, as they were only able to get a brief glimpse of cars speeding down a linear road.|$|E

25|$|One non-trivial {{example is}} the fractal {{dimension}} of a Koch snowflake. It has a topological dimension of 1, but {{it is by no}} means a rectifiable curve: the length of the curve between any two points on the Koch snowflake is infinite. No small piece of it is line-like, but rather it is composed of an infinite number of segments joined at different angles. The fractal dimension of a curve can be explained intuitively <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fractal line as an object too detailed to be one-dimensional, but too simple to be two-dimensional. Therefore its dimension might best be described not by its usual topological dimension of 1 but by its fractal dimension, which in this case is a number between one and two.|$|E
25|$|Romanov was {{the owner}} of the Lithuanian Premier League {{basketball}} club and Euroleague participant BC Žalgiris since May 2009. He made numerous controversial decisions including firing head coaches one by one, first Ramūnas Butautas, and more famously firing head coach Darius Maskoliūnas in the middle of LKL finals series, players had to draw their own tactic schemes and making substitutions, which resulted in losses to the rivals Lietuvos Rytas in decisive games. He also had famous feud with Lietuvos Rytas owners Jonas Vainauskas and Gedvydas Vainauskas, exchanging letters with insults between them. Žalgiris did win the BBL championship, and had a good showing in the Euroleague, nearly making the Top8 phase. Before 2010–11 season started, Zalgiris have purchased several high profile players and a new head coach. In {{the first half of the}} season Zalgiris was consistent, which led to impressive victories in all tournaments. After a positive start that hadn't been seen for years, Vladimir Romanov once again shocked the entire country by firing head coach Aco Petrovic, who was replaced by Elias Zouros, which resulted in a series of losses and Mirza Begić's decision to leave the team. This time, however, Žalgiris won back the LKL championship, as well as the LKF Cup, beating Lietuvos Rytas each time, as well as defeating VEF Rīga in the BBL finals. During the 2011–12 season, Romanov fired two other Žalgiris coaches – head coach Elias Zouros and his assistant coach. The new coach, Aleksandar Trifunović, former longtime head coach of Lietuvos Rytas, became Romanov's favorite, as even with a series of losses, Romanov chose to let the coach continue his work, resulting in repeats as LKL, BBL and LKF cup champions, once again beating rivals Lietuvos Rytas. Before the 2013 season, Romanov built up a very powerful team, with many fans even <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spot in the Euroleague playoffs, as well as hiring new coach Joan Plaza. After an incredible start, with wins in the Euroleague, LKL and VTB tournaments, Romanov admitted to running out of money. Romanov resigned from Zalgiris on 28 February 2013, two weeks after the collapse of Ūkio Bankas. Before leaving, Romanov sold his shares to the team veterans.|$|E

The Mexican hotel apartment was created from Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) old apartment set.|$|E

500|$|According to Semyon Gluzman, {{abuse of}} {{psychiatry}} to suppress dissent {{is based on}} condition of psychiatry in a totalitarian state. Psychiatric paradigm of a totalitarian state is culpable for its expansion into spheres which are not initially those of psychiatric competence. Psychiatry as a social institution, formed and functioning in the totalitarian state, is incapable of not being totalitarian. Such psychiatry is forced to serve the two differently directed principles: care and treatment of mentally ill citizens, on the one hand, and psychiatric repression of people showing political or ideological dissent, on the other hand. In {{the conditions of the}} totalitarian state, independent-minded psychiatrists appeared and may again appear, but these few people cannot change the situation in which thousands of others, who were brought up on incorrect pseudoscientific concepts and fear of the state, will sincerely believe that the uninhibited, free <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> citizen is a symptom of madness.

[...] Almost a year earlier, he had called at Robert Catesby's home at Ashby St Ledgers, and complained bitterly about James, who since {{succeeding}} Elizabeth had done little to fulfil his expectations.

Cyrus described the song as depicting the emotions one feels when one cannot stop <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person and believed it related to numerous fans having their first love. [...] "It's a really romantic song", she concluded. [...] "Before the Storm", originally released on the Jonas Brothers' fourth studio album Lines, Vines and Trying Times (2009), is included on The Time of Our Lives as a live rendition.

In 1997, he partnered with music producer Jeff Dawson; they recorded [...] "Bad Day" [...] in 2002. For two weeks, Powter had a melody that [...] "wouldn't go away" [...] from his mind. <b>Thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lyric that would fit the melody, he thought an [...] "up and poppy" [...] lyric would make it [...] "the cheesiest song of all time".

It was the last song to be composed for his album, with Powter writing it in an hour during a ferry journey between Victoria and Vancouver. Powter said it was not a lyrically elaborate song, but that: [...] "mostly it's about phonics. It's about words that sing great. I was mumbling something, and those words came out." ...|$|E
