5|$|Bell led Stokes {{in a poll}} {{conducted}} early in the race, 33% to 17%, before O'Malley declared his candidacy. By late August, Bell slipped in <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>to</b> third place, with O'Malley and Stokes tied. Bell and O'Malley began airing television commercials supporting their campaigns in early August, while Stokes did not begin to air commercials until September. O'Malley also advertised on the radio.|$|E
5|$|The Constitutional Convention convened by the Articles of Confederation Congress in 1787 {{provided}} for a ratification {{process in the}} states that was duly transmitted by Congress to each state. As Virginians went to <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>to</b> elect delegates to its state convention, six states had ratified including the two other largest states of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. But Virginia bisected the new nation from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River; its admission into the prospective union was critical if the United States as a nation-state were to have contiguous continental territory.|$|E

5|$|In January 1858, Stone {{staged a}} highly publicized protest that took the issue of {{taxation}} without representation across the nation. The previous summer she and Blackwell had purchased a house in Orange, New Jersey, and when the first tax bill came, Stone returned it unpaid with the explanation that taxing women while denying {{them the right to}} vote was a violation of America’s founding principles. On January 22, 1858, the city auctioned some of her household goods to pay the tax and attendant court costs. The following month, Stone and Blackwell spoke on taxation without representation before two large meetings in Orange, and circulated petitions asking the New Jersey legislature for woman suffrage. Stone’s protest inspired other tax-paying women to action: some followed her example and refused to pay taxes, with one case reaching the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1863, while others went to <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>to</b> demand their right as tax-payers to vote.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the loss}} was so lopsided, and because Cal was {{expected}} to do highly well this season, many immediately dismissed Cal from any type of national discussion. Cal dropped 13 spots in <b>the</b> AP <b>Poll</b> <b>to</b> #22 and 11 spots in <b>the</b> Coaches <b>Poll</b> <b>to</b> #23, while Tennessee rose twelve spots in <b>the</b> AP <b>poll</b> <b>to</b> #11 and six spots to #17 in <b>the</b> Coaches <b>Poll.</b>|$|R

25|$|After the November 2006 election, it {{was widely}} assumed that Allen {{was no longer a}} viable {{candidate}} for the Republican nomination, principally because of the damage caused by the incidents that caused his double-digit lead in <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>to</b> turn to a narrow defeat that contributed to the Republicans' loss of control of the Senate.|$|E

25|$|Nicaragua held {{a general}} {{election}} on November 5, 2006. The country's voters went to <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>to</b> elect a new President of the Republic and 90 members of the National Assembly, all of whom will serve five-year terms. Daniel Ortega (FSLN) won the race with 37.99% of the vote, Eduardo Montealegre (ALN) trailing with 28.30%, José Rizo (PLC) with 27.1%, Edmundo Jarquín (MRS) with 6.29%, and Edén Pastora (AC) with just 0.29%.|$|E
25|$|The post {{election}} violence therefore is, in part, {{a consequence}} of the failure of President Kibaki and his first Government to exert political control over the country or to maintain sufficient legitimacy as would have allowed a civilised contest with him at <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>to</b> be possible. Kibaki's regime failed to unite the country, and allowed feelings of marginalisation to fester into what became the post election violence. He and his then Government were complacent in the support they considered they would receive in any election from the majority Kikuyu community and failed to heed the views of the legitimate leaders of other communities.|$|E
25|$|With {{the defeat}} of the Confederacy in 1865, the Reconstruction Era began. The United States {{abolished}} slavery without compensation to slaveholders or reparations to freedmen. A Republican Party coalition of black freedmen, northern carpetbaggers and local scalawags controlled state government for three years. The white conservative Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1870, in part by Ku Klux Klan violence and terrorism at <b>the</b> <b>polls,</b> <b>to</b> suppress black voting. Republicans were elected to the governorship until 1876, when the Red Shirts, a paramilitary organization that arose in 1874 and was allied with the Democratic Party, helped suppress black voting. More than 150 black Americans were murdered in electoral violence in 1876.|$|E

25|$|The Liberals {{returned}} in a hung parliament after the election: The Liberals formed a minority government {{with the support}} of the Labour and Irish nationalist MPs. The Lords subsequently accepted the Budget when the land tax proposal was dropped. However, as a result of the dispute over the Budget, the new government introduced resolutions (that would later form the Parliament Bill) to limit the power of the Lords. The Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, asked Edward VII to create sufficient new Liberal peers to pass the Bill if the Lords rejected it. The King assented, provided that Asquith went back to <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>to</b> obtain an explicit mandate for the constitutional change.|$|E

25|$|After the election, a {{state court}} ruled that Waldman's {{children}} had to be reinstated at the yeshiva, an action that was only taken after the judge held Teitelbaum in contempt and fined him personally. Friction continued {{as some of the}} dissidents banned from the synagogue circulated a petition calling for <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>to</b> be moved to a neutral location. It originally drew 150 signatures, but all but 15 retracted their names after being threatened with excommunication by the grand rabbi, signing a document that they had not actually read the petition. One of the dissidents who signed was attacked while praying, and state troopers had to be called in again to disperse a mob that gathered on Waldman's lawn and broke his windows.|$|E

30|$|Data was {{collected}} through a voluntary, open-access, online poll.

Participation was completely anonymous. <b>The</b> <b>poll</b> was available in English and French due to the bilingual character of Canada. A total of 257 organizations, club and coaches were contacted. Responses were collected {{over a period of}} 50  days (February 1, 2015 to March 23, 2015).|$|R
25|$|He {{was also}} the most {{prominent}} Republican to support adding {{an amendment to the}} state constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage. The state's Republican U.S. Senator George Voinovich and then-Senator Mike DeWine opposed the amendment's broad language, fearing it could bar not only same-sex marriage but also civil unions, domestic partnerships, and possibly wills and any legal contracts for homosexuals. Taft later also came out against the amendment, expressing his concern that its ambiguous language would have unintended consequences and leave the state open to a number of lawsuits. During the campaign Blackwell lobbied hard for this measure and was widely credited with attracting many conservative evangelical African Americans to <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>to</b> vote for the measure and for Bush's re-election. The amendment passed with the approval of 62% of the voters.|$|E
25|$|After {{their victory}} over Vanderbilt, Alabama moved up one {{position}} in <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>to</b> the No. 3 spot {{prior to their}} first non-conference game of the season. In a game that saw starting quarterback Joe Namath injured in the second quarter, backup Steve Sloan rallied the Crimson Tide to a 21–0 victory over the NC State Wolfpack in Tuscaloosa. After a scoreless first quarter, Namath twisted his knee with just over 6:00 remaining in the half. Sloan entered the game and led Alabama on a 69-yard drive that culminated with his one-yard touchdown run to give Alabama a 7–0 halftime lead. The Crimson Tide then closed {{the game with a}} three-yard Steve Bowman touchdown run in the third and a 10-yard Sloan touchdown pass to Tommy Tolleson in the fourth that made the final score 21–0. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against NC State to 3–0.|$|E
25|$|By {{the start}} of 1984, as Mulroney began {{learning}} the realities of parliamentary life in the House of Commons, the Tories took a substantial lead in opinion polling. It was almost taken for granted that Trudeau would be heavily defeated by Mulroney {{in the general election}} due no later than 1985. Trudeau announced his retirement in February, and the Liberal Party chose John Turner, previously the Minister of Finance under Trudeau in the 1970s, as its new leader. The Liberals then surged in <b>the</b> <b>polls,</b> <b>to</b> take a lead, after trailing by more than 20 percentage points. Only four days after being sworn in as Prime Minister, Turner called a general election for September. In so doing, he had to postpone a planned Canadian summer visit by Queen Elizabeth II, who makes it her policy to not travel abroad during foreign election campaigns. But the Liberal election campaign machinery was in disarray, leading to a weak campaign.|$|E
