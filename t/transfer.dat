5|$|Archaea show {{high levels}} of {{horizontal}} gene <b>transfer</b> between lineages. Some researchers suggest that individuals can be grouped into species-like populations given highly similar genomes and infrequent gene <b>transfer</b> to/from cells with less-related genomes, as in the genus Ferroplasma. On the other hand, studies in Halorubrum found significant genetic <b>transfer</b> to/from less-related populations, limiting the criterion's applicability. A second concern is to what extent such species designations have practical meaning.|$|E

5|$|Gene <b>transfer</b> between species {{includes}} {{the formation of}} hybrid organisms and horizontal gene <b>transfer.</b> Horizontal gene <b>transfer</b> is the <b>transfer</b> of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among bacteria. In medicine, this contributes {{to the spread of}} antibiotic resistance, as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly <b>transfer</b> them to other species. Horizontal <b>transfer</b> of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the adzuki bean weevil Callosobruchus chinensis has occurred. An example of larger-scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers, which have received a range of genes from bacteria, fungi and plants. Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, allowing <b>transfer</b> of genes even across biological domains.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal gene <b>transfer</b> {{refers to}} the <b>transfer</b> of genetic {{material}} through a mechanism other than reproduction. This mechanism is a common source of new genes in prokaryotes, sometimes thought to contribute more to genetic variation than gene duplication. It is a common means of spreading antibiotic resistance, virulence, and adaptive metabolic functions. Although horizontal gene <b>transfer</b> is rare in eukaryotes, likely examples have been identified of protist and alga genomes containing genes of bacterial origin.|$|E
5|$|In June 2009, {{the club}} broke its own {{record for the}} highest <b>transfer</b> fee ever paid {{in the history of}} {{football}} by agreeing to pay Manchester United €96million (£80million) for the services of Cristiano Ronaldo. The fee of €77.5million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's <b>transfer</b> from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest <b>transfer</b> fee ever paid. This record (in pound sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67m (£65million). The <b>transfer</b> of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly the new world record signing, with the <b>transfer</b> price expected at around €100 million. In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's <b>transfer</b> were leaked which confirmed a world record <b>transfer</b> fee of €100,759,418. The club's sale record came on 26 August 2014, when Manchester United signed Ángel Di María for €75million.|$|E

5|$|In {{ordinary}} circumstances, transduction, conjugation, {{and transformation}} involve <b>transfer</b> of DNA between individual bacteria {{of the same}} species, but occasionally <b>transfer</b> may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the <b>transfer</b> of antibiotic resistance. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene <b>transfer</b> and may be common under natural conditions. Gene <b>transfer</b> is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid <b>transfer</b> of resistance genes between different pathogens.|$|E

5|$|On April 29, 2010, MDOT {{announced}} plans to <b>transfer</b> M-108 in its entirety to the Village of Mackinaw City and Emmet County.

While rebuilding {{the section of the}} highway between US23 and the northern terminus, the welcome center was closed. Plans had this section to be completed, and the center to be reopened, for Memorial Day weekend, with the remainder of construction to be completed in August. Following the <b>transfer</b> to local control, M-108 ceased to be a state highway and the designation was decommissioned. Previous news reports stated that the roadway was too small to merit highway status under federal guidelines. The <b>transfer</b> was completed on December 9, 2010, when MDOT and local officials signed memoranda of understanding to finalize the <b>transfer.</b> The section within the Village of Mackinaw City was transferred to the village, and the remainder to Emmet County.|$|E

5|$|Spray <b>transfer</b> GMAW was {{the first}} metal <b>transfer</b> method used in GMAW, and well-suited to welding {{aluminium}} and stainless steel while employing an inert shielding gas. In this GMAW process, the weld electrode metal is rapidly passed along the stable electric arc from the electrode to the workpiece, essentially eliminating spatter and resulting in a high-quality weld finish. As the current and voltage increases beyond the range of short circuit <b>transfer</b> the weld electrode metal <b>transfer</b> transitions from larger globules through small droplets to a vaporized stream at the highest energies. Since this vaporized spray <b>transfer</b> variation of the GMAW weld process requires higher voltage and current than short circuit <b>transfer,</b> {{and as a result}} of the higher heat input and larger weld pool area (for a given weld electrode diameter), it is generally used only on workpieces of thicknesses above about 6.4mm (0.25in).|$|E
