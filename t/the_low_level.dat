5|$|On August 31, Jimena {{encountered}} strong southerly wind shear, {{causing it}} to quickly weaken back to a tropical storm by September 1. Jimena then turned west-southwest where {{the center of the}} storm passed 105miles (165km) south of Hawaii at 1500 UTC. Jimena continued to weaken as wind shear increased and the storm weakened to a tropical depression on September 3. After weakening back to a depression, Jimena crossed the International Date Line on September 5 at 0600 UTC, where it became the first storm to exist in all three Pacific basins since 1999's Hurricane Dora. However, Jimena was only tracked briefly by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, since strong wind shear resulted in <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>level</b> circulation to be exposed from the center and at 1727 UTC, <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>level</b> had nearly dissipated. At 1800 UTC, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued their final advisory on Jimena as the storm dissipated 715miles (1151km) southeast of Wake Island.|$|E

5|$|The cloud {{pattern of}} the {{depression}} quickly became better organized as a curved band developed around intensifying deep convecltion, and it is estimated the system intensified into Tropical Storm Paul just six hours after forming. Easterly wind shear exposed <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>level</b> circulation {{to the east of}} the area of deep convection, though Paul continued to intensify as it moved through an area of warm waters and progressively weakening wind shear. <b>The</b> <b>low</b> <b>level</b> circulation gradually became more embedded within the convection as the cloud pattern improved. Computer models had troubles in forecasting the future of the storm early in its life; the GFDL model forecast Paul to reach winds of 119mph (191km/h), while global models expected the system to dissipate in 4872hours. Early on October22, wind shear began to decrease, which coincided with an increase of outflow on its eastern side. The storm temporarily degraded in appearance as it turned to the northwest. However, shear sharply abated over Paul late on October22, resulting in the storm quickly gaining organization and intensifying. An eye began to develop within the convection, and Paul intensified into a hurricane early on October23.|$|E

5|$|When Alpha {{came within}} the Doppler weather radar range of Puerto Rico, the radar {{suggested}} that an eyewall-like feature had developed. Alpha was tracking along the southwest {{edge of a}} subtropical ridge. With nearby Hurricane Wilma's large circulation, Alpha was experiencing strong southerly flow from Wilma. Alpha, with its small circulation, was then faced with the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola, which led forecasters to believe Alpha was soon to dissipate. Shortly after Alpha reached its peak intensity on October23 its wind decreased. While convection remained in bands, <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>level</b> circulation was disrupted by land. This left the center ill-defined and difficult to locate.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave accompanied with a {{low pressure}} system moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on August 19. It moved quickly westward and organized, developing banding features and cirrus outflow near the blossoming convection. The wave nearly developed into a tropical cyclone on August 21, though its fast forward motion dislocated <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>level</b> circulation from the deep convection. The wave entered an area of dry air in the central Atlantic Ocean, and by late on August 22 most of the convection dissipated from the system. On August 24, convection increased as the wave passed through the Lesser Antilles, though strong southwesterly upper level wind shear prevented further development. The tropical wave moved through the Caribbean Sea, and developed deep convection due to more favorable conditions over the Gulf of Honduras on August 28. The wave crossed the Yucatán Peninsula, and developed a surface low pressure area on the 29th in the Gulf of Mexico. Convection continued to organize, and the tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Eleven on August 30 while located 335miles (540km) east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas.|$|E
5|$|By October 10, 2004, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} {{weather was}} situated well to the southwest of the Gulf of Tehuantepec.

40|$|Late Cenozoic marine sequences, {{the late}} Miocene to early Pliocene Sagara Group {{and the middle}} Pliocene to early Pleistocene Kakegawa Group develop in the hilly and coastal area facing to Suruga Bay and Enshunada Sea. These marine sediments are coming into notice for {{establishment}} of the late Cenozoic standard section in Japan by many biostratigraphers, chronostratigraphers and magnetostratigraphers because of their continuous deposition and well-preserved fossil occurrences. The present writer clarified the calcareous nannoplankton flora in the Sagara and Kakegawa Groups with a scanning electron microscope technique and distinguished three calcareous nannoplankton zones : the Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilica Zone, the Reticulofenestra japonica Zone and the Reticulofenestra pacifica Zone in ascendidg order. A revised zonation and zonal nomenclature are presented based on the Japanese data. The Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilica Zone - the interval from indefinite base to <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> of Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica. The Reticulofenestra japonica Zone - the interval from <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> of Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica to <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> of Gephyrocapsa oceanica. The Reticulofenestra pacifica Zone - the interval from <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> of Gephyrocapsa oceanica to <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> of Gephyrocapsa protohuxleyi. The Gephyrocapsa oceanica Zone - the interval from <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> of Gephyrocapsa protohuxleyi to <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> of Emiliania huxleyi. The Emiliania huxleyi Zone - the interval from <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> of Emiliania huxleyi to dominant Emilliania huxleyi. The Sagara Group is characterized by common occurrence of Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilica and assigned to {{the lower half of}} the Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilica Zone. The Kakegawa Group extends from the middle part of the Reticulofenestra japonica Zone to the upper part of the Reticulofenestra pacifica Zone. The Tamari Formation belongs to the lower part of the Reticulofenestra japonica Zone. Calcareous nannoplankton flora of the Tamari Formation is clearly distinguished from that of the Sagara Group. The calcareous nannoplankton assemblage of the Tamari Formation is characterized by rare occurrence of Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilica and common occurrence of Pseudoemiliania lacunosa. Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary in this area is confirmed in the upper part of the Hosoya Tuff in the Horinouchi Formation based on the occurrence of Gephyrocapsa oceanica...|$|R
5|$|Early on August 3, {{strong wind}} shear over Chris {{detached}} the deep convection from <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>level</b> circulation, while a building ridge to its north turned the storm towards the west {{into an area}} of drier air. By mid-day on the 3rd the circulation was devoid of any convection within 85miles (135km), while the deeper convection spread across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. Late on August 3, deep convection developed over the center of circulation again, though persistent vertical shear weakened Chris to a tropical depression on August 4. Due to computer models predicting lesser amounts of shear, forecasters indicated the possibility of moderate strengthening in the Gulf of Mexico to a 60mph (95km/h) storm. However, convection remained minimal, and Chris degenerated into a remnant {{area of low pressure}} late on August 4. Late on August 5, convection increased in the remnants of the storm, and forecasters indicated the potential for slow development over the Gulf of Mexico due to marginally favorable conditions. Redevelopment never occurred, and the remnant circulation dissipated near Havana, Cuba on August 6.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Paul was a {{hurricane}} that ultimately struck Mexico as a tropical depression in October 2006.
