40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{application}} of two methods of local analysis on masonry structures.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental and analytical {{study of a}} steel plate connection for joining walls in the Masonite Flexible Building (MFB) system. These connections are used partly for splicing the wall elements and partly for tying down uplifting forces and resisting horizontal shear forces in stabilizing shear walls. The steel plates are inserted in a perimeter slot in the plyboard panel (a composite laminated wood panel) and fixed mechanically with screw fasteners. The load-bearing capacity of the slotted-in steel plate connections are determined experimentally and derived analytically for different failure modes. The test results show ductile post-peak load-slip characteristics, indicating that a plastic design method for shear walls {{can be applied to}} calculate the horizontal load-bearing capacity. The slotted-in steel plate connection concept can also be used for joining shear <b>walls</b> to <b>transverse</b> <b>walls</b> for tying down purposes in order to simplify the stabilization system of the building. The use of <b>transverse</b> <b>walls</b> for resisting uplifting forces introduces a three-dimensional behaviour of the wall junction and a more effective load transfer.

This manoeuvre was finally noticed by Cassius, who countered by moving part of his army south into the marshes and constructing a <b>transverse</b> <b>wall</b> in a bid to cut off Antony’s outstretched right wing. This brought about a general battle on October 3, 42 BC.Antony ordered a charge against Cassius, aiming at the fortifications between Cassius's camp and the marshes. At the same time, Brutus's soldiers, provoked by the triumvir’s army, rushed against Octavian’s army, without waiting for the order of attack (given with the watchword [...] "Liberty"). This surprise assault had complete success: Octavian’s troops were put to flight and pursued up to their camp, which was captured by Brutus’s men, led by Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus. Three of Octavian’s legionary standards were also taken, a clear sign of disbandment. Octavian was not found in his tent: his couch was pierced and cut to pieces. Most ancient historians say that he had been warned in a dream to beware of that day, as he had himself written in his memoirs. Pliny bluntly reports that Octavian went hiding into a marsh.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental analysis of socket base connections of precast concrete structures {{with regard to}} the behavior of transverse walls. The experimental program included seven specimens, for which the type of interface in contact with cast-in-place concrete, the load eccentricities and the embedded lengths were all varied, A design model was proposed to calculate the reinforcements of the transverse walls. Based on the obtained results, some conclusions can be drawn: (a) The top of the <b>transverse</b> <b>wall</b> on the compression side of the smooth connections and the top of the two transverse walls of the rough connections are submitted to a bending-tension and this tension prevails on the bending; (b) The design model proposed for the calculation of the reinforcement of the <b>transverse</b> <b>wall</b> on the compression side provides the best prediction of the experimental results for all specimens when compared to the current design models; (c) For rough interfaces, the top of the <b>transverse</b> <b>wall</b> on the tension side is more requested than the top of <b>transverse</b> <b>wall</b> on the compression side; (d) The results of the proposed design model for the reinforcement of the <b>transverse</b> <b>wall</b> on the tension side of rough connections were in close agreement with the experimental results.

40|$|Abstract Background Longitudinal {{wall motion}} of the right {{ventricle}} (RV), generally quantified as tricuspid annular systolic excursion (TAPSE), has been well studied in pulmonary hypertension (PH). In contrast, <b>transverse</b> <b>wall</b> motion has been examined less. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate regional RV <b>transverse</b> <b>wall</b> motion in PH, and its relation to global RV pump function, quantified as RV ejection fraction (RVEF). Methods In 101 PH patients and 29 control subjects cardiovascular magnetic resonance was performed. From four-chamber cine imaging, RV transverse motion was quantified as the change of the septum-free-wall (SF) distance between end-diastole and end-systole at seven levels along an apex-to-base axis. For each level, regional absolute and fractional transverse distance change (SFD and fractional- SFD) were computed and related to RVEF. Longitudinal measures, including TAPSE and fractional tricuspid-annulus-apex distance change (fractional -TAAD) were evaluated for comparison. Results <b>Transverse</b> <b>wall</b> motion was significantly reduced at all levels compared to control subjects (p fractional -SFD and SFD were related to RVEF, with the strongest relation at mid RV (R 2 = 0. 70, p 2 = 0. 62, p fractional -TAAD, weaker relations with RVEF were found (R 2 = 0. 21, p 2 = 0. 27, p Conclusions Regional <b>transverse</b> <b>wall</b> movements provide important information of RV function in PH. Compared to longitudinal motion, transverse motion at mid RV reveals a significantly stronger relationship with RVEF and thereby might be a better predictor for RV function. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the methods which {{have been used to}} {{demonstrate}} the chromatinic bodies of bacteria will reveal a failing common to all, namely, that they demon-strate the barriers of the bacterial protoplasm very poorly or not at all.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{equilibrium}} micromagnetic domain wall structures encountered in Permalloy strips {{of a wide}} range of thicknesses and widths, with strip widths up to several micrometers. By performing an extensive set of micromagnetic simulations, we show that the equilibrium phase diagram of the domain wall structures exhibits in addition to the previously found structures (symmetric and asymmetric <b>transverse</b> <b>walls,</b> vortex wall) also double vortex and triple vortex domain walls for large enough strip widths and thicknesses. Also several metastable domain wall structures are found for wide and/or thick strips. We discuss the details of the relaxation process from random magnetization initial states towards the stable domain wall structure, and show that our results are robust with respect to changes of e. g. the magnitude of the Gilbert damping constant and details of the initial conditions.
