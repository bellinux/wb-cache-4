5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela mostly inhabits mangroves in monsoonal coastal areas, especially <b>thickets</b> of spotted mangrove (Rhizophora stylosa), smallflower bruguiera (Bruguiera parviflora) and grey mangrove (Avicennia marina) bordering islands or in river deltas, but {{it often}} also occurs in paperbark <b>thickets</b> fringing the mangroves {{such as those}} of cajeput (Melaleuca leucadendra). It is a mangrove specialist, an adaptation that probably occurred as northern Australia became more arid and the bird populations became dependent on mangroves as other types of forest disappeared. The mangroves provide nectar and insects as well as shelter and nesting sites, and they supply the majority of the species' needs for most of the year. In Australia, mangrove vegetation forms a narrow discontinuous strip along thousands of kilometres of coastline, accommodating birds specialized for the habitat. Eighty Mile Beach in Western Australia has no mangroves and no fringing Melaleuca forests, reducing its potential for successful colonization by nectarivores, and it marks the southern limit of the red-headed myzomela in Western Australia.|$|E
40|$|Subtropical {{transitional}} <b>thicket,</b> traditionally {{known as}} valley bushveld, covers {{a significant proportion}} of the eastern Cape. This paper attempts to classify the subtropical transitional <b>thicket</b> into syntaxonomic and structural units and relate it to other <b>thicket</b> types on a continental basis. Twelve sites along a rainfall gradient were sampled for floristic and structural attributes. The floristic data were classified using TWINSPAN. Results indicate that the class subtropical transitional <b>thicket</b> has at least two orders of vegetation, namely kaffrarian <b>thicket</b> and kaffrarian succulent <b>thicket.</b> Two forms of <b>thicket</b> were recognized for both these orders viz. mesic kaffrarian <b>thicket</b> and xeric kaffrarian <b>thicket</b> for the kaffrarian <b>thicket</b> and mesic succulent <b>thicket</b> and xeric succulent <b>thicket</b> for the kaffrarian succulent <b>thicket.</b> Ordination of site data by DECORANA grouped sites according to these vegetation categories and in a sequence along axis 1 to which the rainfall gradient can be clearly related. Variation within the mesic kaffrarian <b>thicket</b> was however greater than between some of the other <b>thicket</b> types, indicating that more data are required before these forms of <b>thicket</b> can be formalized.

40|$|<b>Thicket</b> {{degradation}} {{within the}} Addo Elephant National Park (AENP), Eastern Cape, South Africa {{is a key}} issue of concern. The increasing elephant densities have over time threatened <b>thicket</b> vegetation, which is endemic to this area. The “elephant problem” within the Park has raised many concerns as to the vulnerability of <b>thicket</b> to elephant impacts. Remote sensing provides {{an environment in which}} temporal changes in <b>thicket</b> vegetation condition can be assessed. The main aim {{of this study was to}} assess temporal and spatial trends in <b>thicket</b> degradation within the AENP, using multi-temporal satellite imagery. Elephant induced <b>thicket</b> degradation was assessed using multi-temporal satellite imagery from between 1973 and 2010. Changes in <b>thicket</b> condition in relation to the AENP expansion were analysed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), post-classification and landscape metrics. The ‘per-pixel’ based classification approach was carried out and change detection of land cover classes was analysed by post-classification. Landscape spatial metrics were used in order to gain an understanding of vegetation fragmentation trends. Temporal changes in vegetation gradients in relation to water points and <b>thicket</b> condition within the botanical reserves were also assessed. <b>Thicket</b> condition was noted to deteriorate as the AENP expanded. An expansion of degraded vegetation away from the water points was identified during the study period. <b>Thicket</b> condition in botanical reserves 1 and 2 fluctuated over time, with a registered increase in intact <b>thicket</b> within botanical reserve 2, with botanical reserve 3 remaining constant. Landscape spatial metric analyses revealed evidence of increased vegetation fragmentation as new areas of the AENP were opened for elephant activity. A progressive decline in intact <b>thicket</b> and increase in degraded <b>thicket</b> were observed. Considering the current elephant densities, <b>thicket</b> degradation within AENP is set to continue, causing a continued threat to the <b>thicket</b> biom...|$|R

The more than hundred-fold lower infiltration in soils associated with degraded <b>thicket</b> relative to the soils beneath the intact, spekboom canopy, resulted in lower levels and less retention of soil moisture, almost double the amount of runoff, and an almost six-fold increase in sediment load.

40|$|The {{opencast}} {{extraction of}} limestone at the PPC Cement (Pty) Ltd Loerie quarry in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, {{has led to}} disturbance of the immediate environment. Large tracts of <b>thicket</b> have been removed during mining and exhausted quarry areas had to be revegetated. Revegetation commenced 16 years ago {{and as a result}} of progressive revegetation efforts since then, five seral stages were available for study. This presented an opportunity to describe the successional progression that occurs where <b>thicket</b> topsoil was used for revegetation. The quarry lies near the Gamtoos fault and both <b>thicket</b> and mountain fynbos is found in proximity to the mine. Before mining, the area was covered by <b>thicket</b> and quarry floors were revegetated by covering landscaped areas with <b>thicket</b> topsoil. The vegetation that developed in the quarry had a very low floristic relationship to fynbos. After 16 years, the vegetation also had a low similarity to <b>thicket,</b> even though the soils used for revegetation contained <b>thicket</b> propagules.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{approach}} and {{results of an}} intuitive, expert-based mapping exercise to identify subtropical <b>thicket</b> (including Acocks’ (1953) Valley Bushveld, Noorsveld and Spekboomveld) vegetation types as features for conservation planning. The study area comprised 105 500 km 2 in southern and south-eastern South Africa, the planning domain for the Subtropical <b>Thicket</b> Ecosystem Planning (STEP) Project. We developed a four-tier typological hierarchy based on geography, floristics, structure and grain. This yielded 112 unique <b>thicket</b> vegetation types, 78 of which comprised <b>thicket</b> clumps in a matrix of non-thicket vegetation (mosaics). By identifying mosaics, we expanded the subtropical <b>thicket</b> concept and increased its extent {{in the study area}} by between 1. 8 and 2. 8 times that of earlier assessments. We also compiled a list of plant species that yielded a rich flora of 1 558 species, 20 % of which are endemic to our expanded <b>thicket</b> biome.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the {{economic}} differences between withdraw of forest fuel and withdraw of pulpwood in first thinning, to see which method gives the maximum profitability (income - cost). Another purpose is to investigate the economic impact of the <b>thicket</b> cleaning. The study compares four different methods: i) pulpwood output with <b>thicket</b> cleaning, ii) pulpwood output without <b>thicket</b> cleaning, iii) forest fuel output with <b>thicket</b> cleaning and iv) forest fuel output without <b>thicket</b> cleaning. The study was conducted in a 30 -years old stand, dominated by spruce, outside Harg in Uppland. The method that generated the best economic net income was pulpwood without <b>thicket</b> cleaning. It generated a positive net of 1, 383 SEK per hectare. Forest fuel output without <b>thicket</b> cleaning also generated a positive net in 720 kronor per hectare. On the other hand both methods with <b>thicket</b> cleaning generated a negative net. The results of this study show that the costs of the first thinning have a great importance for the economic result, and also that the brushing is quite expensive. In conclusion pulpwood thinning is still the best option in the first thinning and <b>thicket</b> cleaning may not always be a given action before thinning...|$|R
40|$|Endozoochory is an {{important}} form of seed dispersal and as such plays {{a fundamental role in}} plant population and community ecology. This is especially true in the Subtropical <b>Thicket</b> biome where many plant species are adapted for endozoochory. Endozoochorous seed dispersal is carried out by a wide range of <b>thicket</b> fauna, but changes in the faunal assemblage associated with transformed <b>thicket</b> threatens to disrupt the process of endozoochorous seed dispersal and in turn the regeneration dynamics of <b>thicket</b> plants. Outside of conservation areas, indigenous seed dispersers are often replaced by domestic species, such as goats, which are hypothesized to differ in their seed dispersal efficiencies. The dispersal efficiencies of important <b>thicket</b> seed dispersers that occur in transformed and untransformed <b>thicket</b> were therefore investigated. The influence of gut morphologyphysiology on seed gut passage time, seed mortality and germination in animal species representing different digestive models was measured, as well as the role of black-backed jackal in <b>thicket</b> plant seed dispersal. Black-backed jackal were found to disperse the seeds of few <b>thicket</b> plant species and are therefore not considered important <b>thicket</b> seed dispersers under the climatic conditions prevailing during the study. The average gut passage time of seeds was found to differ significantly between birds and mammals, but not between elephants (hindgut fermentor), goats (ruminant) and pigs (omnivore, foregut fermentor) as was expected considering the differences in their digestive morphology. A significantly shorter gut passage of large seeds compared with small seeds was observed in goats, due to the regurgitation of larger seeds. Seed regurgitation in ruminants may prove to be {{an important}} factor contributing to their quality as seed dispersers in transformed <b>thicket.</b> The mortality of seeds was significantly higher in goats than in elephants, probably due to the efficient digestion associated with ruminants. The effect of gut passage on seed germination was not consistent and varied between animal species and across different <b>thicket</b> plant species. It was concluded that seed dispersers that occur in transformed and untransformed <b>thicket</b> differ in their seed dispersal efficiency due, in part, to differences in the nature of their digestive tracts. This has important implications for the process of seed dispersal in <b>thicket,</b> and the rehabilitation of degraded <b>thicket</b> vegetation...|$|R

40|$|Subtropical <b>thicket</b> {{supports}} a large variety of indigenous browsing herbivores, such as elephants, black rhino, kudu and bushbuck, but impala historically never {{occurred in the}} Eastern Cape. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine what impacts extralimital impala (Aepyceros melampus) have on subtropical <b>thicket.</b> The <b>thicket</b> of the Shamwari Game Reserve, Eastern Cape, was used for the study. To quantify the effects of impala, feeding behaviour and diet was investigated during summer and winter. Sixteen impala were also enclosed in a camp of subtropical <b>thicket</b> where they would be limited to feedings on <b>thicket.</b> Vegetation composition and structure were monitored for a period of 12 months in the enclosure. Impala followed the expected high percentage graze and a low percentage browse in <b>thicket</b> in summer. However, the expected was not observed during winter: at this time grazing and browsing were equally important. Field collection of feeding behaviour data showed that impala are attracted to fringes of intact bush clumps or degraded <b>thicket.</b> Analysis of the impala diet confirmed this, with a significantly higher percentage graze (48 percent) than browse (22 percent) during summer. However, during winter, diet analysis indicated grazing to be much higher (36 percent) than browsing (6 percent) with the impala temporarily taking advantage of nutritious grasses still present. The enclosed portion of <b>thicket</b> was originally at 80 percent ecological status but it showed significant changes after addition of 16 impala. Animal trails increased in number and in width, resulting in a trampling effect. Grass cover was significantly different inside the enclosure after 12 months compared to outside. The amount of available browse of the enclosed <b>thicket</b> was also significantly different after addition of the impala. It is concluded that impala have a negative effect on <b>thicket,</b> with trampling the most significant effect. Long term monitoring of the effects of extralimital impala in different types of <b>thicket</b> will be required to accurately quantify their direct effects on subtropical <b>thicket</b> in the Eastern Cape.
