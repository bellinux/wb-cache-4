25|$|The main {{themes in}} Brennan's short stories are {{feelings}} of loneliness, vulnerability, despair, spite, and fear. She often wrote about unhappy, loveless marriages {{and people with}} claustrophobic, sad and disappointed lives. Her studies of these relationships sometimes have a cruel tone. Another theme is about how the individual's need for expression is countered and restricted by the need for societal acceptance in a country <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> traditions steeped {{in the church and}} strict convention. For example, in The Devil In Us she describes a convent school that uses morals to cruelly stop any type of nonconformity.|$|E
25|$|Dee {{attended}} the Chelmsford Chantry School (now King Edward VI Grammar School) from 1535 to 1542. He entered St John's College, Cambridge, in November 1542, aged 15, graduating BA in 1545 or early 1546. His abilities recognised, {{he became an}} original fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, on its founding by Henry VIII in 1546. At Trinity, the clever stage effects he produced for a production of Aristophanes' Peace procured him {{the reputation of being}} a magician <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> him through life. In the late 1540s and early 1550s, he travelled in Europe, studying at Louvain (1548) and Brussels and lecturing in Paris on Euclid. He studied with Gemma Frisius and became a close friend of the cartographer Gerardus Mercator and cartographer Abraham Ortelius. Dee also travelled extensively throughout Europe meeting and working with as well as learning from other leading continental mathematicians such as Federico Commandino in Italy. He returned to England with an important collection of mathematical and astronomical instruments. In 1552, he met Gerolamo Cardano in London: during their acquaintance they investigated a perpetual motion machine as well as a gem purported to have magical properties.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} transfer, Grant began his {{campaign}} to capture Vicksburg and open the Mississippi River. After the initial failure of his traditional overland approach, he devised several plans aimed at bypassing the fixed defenses of the city. One of these {{became known as the}} Steele's Bayou Expedition. Mound City, now commanded by Lieutenant Commander Byron Wilson, {{was a member of a}} flotilla that attempted to reach the Yazoo River through a web of bayous, sloughs, creeks, and rivers. Porter himself accompanied the expedition and made the important decisions. Progress was slow because of the tight turns in the narrow streams, the trees that overhung the channels, and willow roots <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> the hulls of the vessels as they attempted to pass; they were brought to a complete halt by Confederate soldiers who felled trees in the intended path. Unable to dislodge the enemy, Porter ordered a retreat, but then found that a party of Rebels had circled behind him and were cutting him off. Porter sent an immediate appeal for help to Grant, and then had his subordinates prepare to destroy their vessels rather than let them fall into enemy hands. The appeal was passed on to Major General William T. Sherman, commanding the Fifteenth Army Corps and already in the vicinity. He ordered two of his regiments forward immediately, and they met up with Porter's flotilla on the afternoon of 21 March. Sherman himself accompanied a larger body of troops that arrived in the enemy's rear the next day. The surprised Confederate soldiers immediately fled. Although the expedition was no longer opposed by the Rebels, Porter and Sherman concluded that nothing would be gained by resuming the advance. Accordingly, the retreat continued, and the flotilla was back on the Mississippi on 27 March.|$|E
60|$|The Captain {{spoke in}} such a {{trembling}} voice, and looked at Florence with a face so pale and agitated, <b>that</b> she <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> his hand in affright.|$|R
6000|$|Yea, {{voice of}} every Soul <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> [...] <b>To</b> life <b>that</b> strove from rung to rung [...] When Devadatta's rule was young, [...] The warm wind brings Kamakura.|$|R
6000|$|I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy <b>that</b> I <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> {{him with}} both hands, and said, [...] "If you would kindly please {{to let me}} keep upright, sir, perhaps I shouldn't be sick, and perhaps I could attend more." ...|$|R
500|$|The [...] "Time Beetle", {{which was}} {{responsible}} for the creation of the alternate universe, was described in the episode's script as [...] "a huge black beetle... shiny carapace, spindly black legs moving and flexing, mandibles clacking together". Its design was influenced by the Giant Spider of Metebelis 3 <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> Sarah Jane Smith's back in Planet of the Spiders. The beetle's normal Earth-like appearance was deliberate; prosthetic designer Niell Gorton thought that familiarity would ease the narrative and cited the cat nuns from [...] "New Earth" [...] and the Judoon from [...] "Smith and Jones" [...] as examples. The prosthetic was made using fibreglass and fitted on a harness in order not to burden Catherine Tate's performance. The episode's director Graeme Harper explained in the episode's commentary that only psychic characters such as Lucius from [...] "The Fires of Pompeii" [...] were aware of the beetle's existence.|$|E
2500|$|However, by {{the late}} 1950s, her health was deteriorating rapidly, and {{director}} K. Asif, probably unaware {{of the extent of}} Madhubala's illness, required long shooting schedules that made physical demands on her, whether it was posing as a veiled statue in suffocating make-up for hours under the studio lights or being shackled with heavy chains. It was also a time when Madhubala's relationship with Dilip Kumar was fading out, and [...] "The lives of Madhubala and her screen character are consistently seen as overlapping, it is because of the overwhelming sense of loss and tragedy and the unrelenting diktat of destiny <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> both and which neither could escape".|$|E
2500|$|The Matterhorn {{remained}} unstudied {{for more}} than two centuries, until a geologist from Geneva, Horace Benedict de Saussure, travelled to the mountain, which filled him with admiration. However, de Saussure was not moved to climb the mountain, and had no hope of measuring its altitude by taking a barometer to its summit. [...] "Its precipitous sides," [...] he wrote, [...] "which give no hold to the very snows, are such as to afford no means of access." [...] Yet his scientific interest was kindled by [...] "the proud peak which rises to so vast an altitude, like a triangular obelisk, that seems to be carved by a chisel." [...] His mind intuitively grasped the causes which gave the peak its present precipitous form: the Matterhorn was not like a perfected crystal; the centuries had laboured to destroy a great part of an ancient and much larger mountain. On his first journey de Saussure had come from Ayas to the Col des Cimes Blanches, from where the Matterhorn first comes into view; descending to Breuil, he ascended to the Theodul Pass. On his second journey, in 1792, he came to the Valtournanche, studying and describing it; he ascended to the Theodul Pass, where he spent three days, analysing the structure of the Matterhorn, whose height {{he was the first to}} measure, and collecting stones, plants and insects. He made careful observations, from the sparse lichen <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> the rocks to the tiny but vigorous glacier fly that fluttered over the snows and whose existence at such heights was mysterious. At night he took refuge under the tent erected near the ruins of an old fort at the top of the pass. During these days he climbed the Klein Matterhorn (3,883 metres), which he named the Cime Brune du Breithorn.|$|E
60|$|At the top {{clustered}} {{a jumble}} of buildings hanging high aloft in the windy space a crooked wooden belfry, a tall, narrow watch-tower, and a rude wooden house <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> partly <b>to</b> {{the roof of the}} great tower and partly to the walls.|$|R
6000|$|... “I suppose not, Dimchurch, and {{certainly}} for myself I {{would rather be}} blown up than hanged. I suppose {{the reason why they}} did not blow up the ship when they found their plan had failed was <b>that</b> they <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> life even for a few days.” ...|$|R
6000|$|And Catherine, in her horned head-gear and {{flutter of}} {{spangled}} veil, was almost swallowed {{up in his}} hearty embrace; and the fervency of his great love so far warmed her, <b>that</b> she <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> him, and tenderly said, 'My lord, it is long since I saw you.' ...|$|R
60|$|All {{the time}} One-eyed Hans was {{brushing}} away the sparks <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> his clothes. He was {{as black as}} ink {{from head to foot}} with the soot from the chimney.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go {{and look}} within the Fence, old hag. There thou wilt see {{the best of}} those <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> thee, seeking for peace. Art thou a coward that thou lingerest behind them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, I remember," [...] the Easy Chair murmured, and, as the unreal editor {{bent forward}} to pluck away certain sprays of foliage <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> its old red back, it demanded, [...] "What is that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{least we}} have nothing left," [...] said Sybil, [...] "but our old faith; and <b>that</b> we have <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> through good report and evil report." ...|$|R
60|$|Poor Tessa's {{heart beat}} {{fast as she}} trudged away with Tommo, who slung his harp over his shoulder, and gave her his hand. It was rather a dirty hand, but so kind <b>that</b> Tessa <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> it, and kept {{looking up at the}} {{friendly}} brown face for encouragement.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, dear! les voila!' cried Clara, as, {{entering}} Hanover Square, they beheld {{about twenty}} damsels {{coming out of}} the garden in couples. 'I would not have had it happen for the whole world!' she added, abruptly withdrawing the arm <b>that</b> had <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> him so trustfully across many a perilous crossing.|$|R
60|$|Dark, dark was the {{day when}} we looked on Culloden And chill was the mist drop <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> the tree, The oats of the harvest hung heavy and sodden, No light on the land and no wind on the sea.|$|E
60|$|Still {{many days}} {{passed and the}} Parki yet floated. The little flying- fish got used to her familiar, {{loitering}} hull; and like swallows building their nests in quiet old trees, they spawned in the great green barnacles <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> her sides.|$|E
60|$|She {{fought with}} the pearls <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> the flowers. The {{transport}} was moving steadily on. Steve was already beneath her. This was the moment. The next moment {{and he would be}} past. She sobbed, and Jeremy Sambrooke glanced at her inquiringly.|$|E
60|$|The boy looked, bewildered, {{from the}} ape to his father, {{and from his}} father to the ape.

6000|$|... "Look," [...] said Virgil. [...] "The Furies! The one on {{the left}} is Megæra; Alecto is she that is wailing on the right; and in the middle is Tisiphone." [...] Virgil then hushed. The Furies stood clawing their breasts, smiting their hands together, and raising such hideous cries, <b>that</b> Dante <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> his friend.|$|R
6000|$|So I cried (pray {{remember}} this all was a dream): [...] "Get {{off of the}} platform!--it isn't the kind!"

60|$|In {{the evening}} air the dying flowers sent their heady {{fragrance}} around. Armand was intoxicated with the perfume of violets <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> Jeanne's fingers, with {{the touch of}} her satin gown that brushed his cheek, with the murmur of her voice that quivered through her tears.|$|E
60|$|The {{child he}} was nursing {{stretched}} forth its arms and cried {{out to be}} taken by Charley. The little girl took it, in a womanly sort of manner belonging to the apron and the bonnet, and stood looking at us over the burden <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> her most affectionately.|$|E
60|$|And {{in a low}} voice, as {{the cart}} went slowly along through {{the midst of the}} gazing crowd, she poured forth her soul with the wrestling {{intensity}} of a last pleading, for the trembling creature <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> her and clutched her as the only visible sign of love and pity.|$|E
60|$|He was right; Mrs. Poynsett {{was touched}} by finding <b>that</b> Cecil <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> them rather than to her sublime family, and {{especially}} by the design as to little Raymond, though she said that must never be mentioned; nothing must bind so young a creature as Cecil, who really {{did not know what}} love was at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "After {{sometimes}} not daring {{to dwell on}} him, and then only venturing because I thought he must be dead, to have him back again with the same looks, only deeper--to find <b>that</b> he <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> those weeks so long ago, and, above all, {{that there was not}} one cloud, one doubt about the troubles--Oh, it is too, too much." ...|$|R
50|$|More recent {{research}} suggests that an old fashioned script <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> too closely <b>to</b> the conventions of silent film was a more likely culprit.The film {{is based on the}} 1928 play Olympia by Ferenc Molnár.|$|R
6000|$|... "Get {{away with}} you--go!" [...] said Tulliver, angrily. But {{it was not}} to Wakem that he spoke. Slowly the lawyer rose, and, as he turned his head, saw that Tulliver's arms were being held by a girl, rather by the fear of hurting the girl <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> him with all her young might.|$|E
60|$|Parson Jones himself leaped {{down into}} the hole, and began {{scraping}} away the sand with his hands {{as though he had}} gone crazy. At last, with some difficulty, they tugged and hauled the chest up out of the sand to the surface, where it lay covered all over with the grit <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|E
60|$|Fifteen minutes later, Slackwater Charley and Webster Shaw returning, {{caught a}} glimpse of a ghostly {{pendulum}} swinging {{back and forth in the}} dim light. As they hurriedly drew in closer, they made out the man's inert body, and a live thing <b>that</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> it, and shook and worried, and gave to it the swaying motion.|$|E
6000|$|The proud shall pass, forgot; the chill, [...] 45 [...] Damp, {{trickling}} Vault {{their only}} mourner! [...] Not so the regal Rose, <b>that</b> still [...] <b>Clung</b> <b>to</b> the breast which first had worn her! ...|$|R

50|$|This {{is one of}} the painter's last works, and one of {{the most}} bitter. The {{contrast}} of light and shade gave him pleasure.
