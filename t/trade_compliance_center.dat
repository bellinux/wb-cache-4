40|$|In {{the field}} of {{robotics}} and automatic assembly tooling, it is often necessary to provide some compliance when fitting two parts together or when engaging a tool with a complementarily shaped aperture. This need arises because of the tolerances in gripping and positioning capability of a robot arm and the dimensional tolerances of the members being positioned. The use of excessive force to engage two imperfectly aligned members can lead to damage to the members or assembly tooling. A remote centre compliance (RCC) is a device that can provide a <b>compliance</b> <b>center</b> projected outward from the device. Remote <b>compliance</b> <b>centers</b> decouple lateral and angular motion. A RCC device {{can be used in}} assembly to ease the insertion force. When a project <b>compliance</b> <b>center</b> is near the insertion point of a peg-in-hole type assembly, the peg translates into the hole when it strikes the outside lead-in chamfer without rotating. This translation without rotation prevents the jamming and galling seen from compliance devices that have a <b>compliance</b> <b>center</b> far away from the insertion point. The proposed work aims at designing and developing an intelligent RCC device which helps the parts assemble even if there are misalignments of known limits and is capable of capturing useful information for the assembly process...|$|R

40|$|Regulators {{demand the}} {{impossible}} when they require issuers {{to design and}} implement effective insider <b>trading</b> <b>compliance</b> programs because insider trading is a crime that neither Congress nor the Securities Exchange Commission has defined with any specificity. This problem of uncertainty is then compounded {{by the threat of}} heavy civil and criminal sanctions for violations. Placed between this rock and hard place, issuers tend to adopt overbroad insider <b>trading</b> <b>compliance</b> programs, which comes at a heavy price in terms of corporate culture, cost of compensation, share liquidity, and cost of capital. The irony is that, since all of these costs are ultimately passed along to the shareholders, insider trading enforcement under the current regime has precisely the opposite of its intended effect. This is the paradox of insider <b>trading</b> <b>compliance</b> for issuers, just one more symptom of a dysfunctional insider trading enforcement regime that is in need of a dramatic overhaul. There are a number of conceivable paths to resolving this paradox. The most obvious solution would be for the Securities Exchange Commission to issue a rule or for Congress to promulgate a statute defining insider trading with greater specificity. But while simply fixing definitions to the elements of insider trading under the current regime would improve matters, this Article calls for a more radical solution. It suggests that the current enforcement regime be liberalized to permit insider trading where an issuer approves a trade in advance and has disclosed that it permits such trading pursuant to regulatory guidelines. It argues that such reform would lead to a more rational, efficient, and just insider trading enforcement regime. Moreover, by aligning the interests of issuers, shareholders, and regulators, this reform would also offer the most effective solution to the paradox of insider <b>trading</b> <b>compliance...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} stability of planar grasps with a multi-fingered robotic hand, using energy approach and geometric interpretation. A more general non-linear finger model was adopted, which reveals that the conditions for stability, obtained by traditional linearized model, are too relaxed. Geometrically, the critical conditions for the linearized planar model constitute a hyperplane {{in the space of}} grasping forces, whereas the non-linearized model constitutes a thirdorder surface contained within the permissible region of the former. Hence, allowable grasping forces calculated by a linearized model may practically lead to instability. The linearized finger model analysis shows that at critical force there is one and only one instantaneous instability center fixed in the plane (which coincides with the <b>compliance</b> <b>center</b> during loading), infinitesimal rotation about which causes instability. When a nonlinearized finger model is considered, the <b>compliance</b> <b>center</b> position depends on the applied forces and it moves in the plane during loading. Furthermore, in some cases, there appear a set of instantaneous instability centers as the critical level of forces is reached. 1...|$|R

50|$|With new {{positions}} {{and a growing}} challenge, PPQ established two additional satellite programs: Closing the Los Angeles Marketplace Pathway (CLAMP) and Florida Interdiction and Smuggling Team (FIST). State and Federal officials in the CLAMP program were tasked to detect smuggled fruit-fly host material and close the pathway of that harmful pest. FIST, on the other hand, had objectives much larger in scope. Both programs effectively sealed off pathways for potential exotic pest introductions into the United States. As the organization became more successful, it was recognized into a disparate regulatory force within PPQ and reorganized into the current Smuggling Interdiction and <b>Trade</b> <b>Compliance</b> program.|$|R
50|$|In the marketplace, SITC {{officers}} conduct inspection {{surveys and}} intense <b>trade</b> <b>compliance</b> activities, looking to uncover prohibited or regulated items.

Lastly, the program has influenced changes in federal regulations in its efforts to regulate trade while promoting outreach and education to the public.|$|R
40|$|Recently the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has {{promoted}} {{the endorsement of}} voluntary industry codes of conduct. The ACCC's 14 October 2003 draft guidelines suggest the endorsement of 'industry best practice' codes separately, but related to, individual <b>trade</b> practices <b>compliance</b> programs. In public submissions, industry groups have identified problems with the ACCC's proposals. In this article, {{it is argued that}} endorsement of voluntary industry codes should not be separated from a commitment to individual <b>trade</b> practices <b>compliance.</b> Codes in themselves are not a compliance solution. In 1994, the Australian Law Reform Commission found that codes of conduct are a form of co-regulation. It also found {{that there needs to be}} a level of mutual commitment to a code from the regulator and its regulated entities. That commitment may be lacking if businesses find that the ACCC's code endorsement process is less rewarding than their own compliance processes. Recent research data suggests that Australian businesses prefer <b>trade</b> practices <b>compliance</b> programs derived from their own compliance culture. Simple obedience by a business to an ACCC endorsed industry code is not consistent with this trend. 6 page(s...|$|R
