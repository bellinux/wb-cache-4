50|$|As it {{now appears}} to be {{accepted}} that for numerous reasons places undergo a process evolution which can impact upon their prosperity, it has become more widely acknowledged that deliberate and co-ordinated intervention in this evolution is desirable. Recognising a symbiotic relationship between the prosperity of a location and the prosperity of retail, firms Boots the Chemist, J Sainsburys and Marks & Spencer in the UK contributed to the development of place management by supporting local authorities in the formation of locally based intervention schemes. This led to the appointments of the United Kingdom's first <b>town</b> <b>centre</b> <b>managers</b> in Ilford and the London Borough of Redbridge in 1987. This consequently {{led to the formation of}} the Association of <b>Town</b> <b>Centre</b> Management.

40|$|Notwithstanding the {{importance}} of retailing to urban economies, the role of retailing in the marketing of urban places has been an area neglected by both academics and practitioners alike. It is acknowledged that the principles of marketing can be applied (albeit with modification) to the context of urban places. The theoretical implications of this are considered using Corsico's (1993) metaphors {{of the city as}} enterprise, market and commodity. Such issues are considered via a survey of place marketing actors within the specific context of the marketing of towns and cities as shopping destinations in urban places classified as sub-regional and above. Particular attention is paid to responsibility for the marketing of the retail provision, the emphasis given to retail in the marketing/promotional activities of various urban stakeholders, the perceived role of retailing, and the factors influencing the nature of the urban retail provision. Promotion of retailing was found to be important for all urban stakeholders {{to a greater or lesser}} degree. However, prime responsibility lay with <b>town</b> <b>centre</b> <b>managers</b> and shopping <b>centre</b> <b>managers.</b> The implications for both theory and practice are discussed...|$|R
40|$|While {{the number}} of marriages taking place in Britain {{continues}} to decline, the hen party has become both an accepted marriage ritual {{and a source of}} controversy. In previous research we have found bar owners and <b>town</b> <b>centre</b> <b>managers</b> eager to discourage hen parties from their <b>town</b> <b>centres</b> and venues. Equally, in the popular press, the hen party is increasingly portrayed in comparable terms to the 'stag do'; a night of drunken excess and embarrassing misdemeanours. This paper examines the hen party in terms of the articulation of gender, alcohol and public space. Through a wide-ranging literature survey and pilot interviews, we ask if the hen party exaggerates existing behaviours and practices, or whether it represents an entirely new, albeit limited, example of how women are using public space at night. Against the backdrop of a historical anxiety about women and public space, and growing concern about women and binge drinking, we examine the hen party as both a site of transgression, empowerment and female bonding, and as a unique opportunity to explore women's shifting attitudes to late-night culture...|$|R
40|$|The {{retail sector}} plays a {{strategic}} part in urban regeneration. In this sense, municipal officials need to implement plans and encourage measures that will offset the relative loss of commercial appeal to out-of-town retail zones. To achieve this, {{it is important}} that they understand how shoppers choose between two possible locations. Using logistic regression functions, this work analyses to what extent a set of four judgemental indicators in a city’s different districts, forming its retail attractiveness, exerts a compensating effect by reducing the outcome of out-of-town shopping. Results confirm that retail attractiveness of districts, in interaction both with the entropy of shopping formats within the city, and with the size of the shopping basket, exerts an inhibiting effect to shopping acts in out-of-town retail areas. The study ends with recommendations for <b>town</b> <b>centre</b> <b>managers,</b> public authorities and private bodies towards reverting the reducing affluence of shopping acts in city centres. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a series of semi-structured {{interviews}} held in two English cities with stakeholders who hold potential responsibility for the marketing of the city as a shopping destination. The findings of the research are structured in terms of the process by which place marketing activity is developed (relating to the remits of individual actors, the extent and nature of their interaction and the process of planning place marketing activity), the content of place marketing activity (relating {{to the extent to which}} marketing activity is consumer-focused, the nature of the elements of the urban place product and their interaction, and the specific marketing activities undertaken), and context factors influencing place marketing activity in the specific locations (following de Wit and Meyer's (1998) framework). Analysis of the data from the interviews reveal numerous actors with potential responsibility for the marketing of the urban areas, who engage in frequent formal and informal interaction in order to achieve their specific remits. Regarding content of place marketing activity, the marketing of the town as a shopping destination is largely the remit of the <b>town</b> <b>centre</b> <b>manager,</b> although the importance of retailing is articulated by other actors. Various important contextual factors specific to retailing which impact on place marketing activity are identified. These include the level of shop rentals, supply of retail premises, car parking availability and tariffs, and the presence of off-centre retail facilities. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper was to explore the notion of ‘Third Place’ in an arts context by {{exploring}} the consumption of two arts venues, Tate Modern and the Southbank Centre on the regenerated South Bank in London, UK. Design: an interpretative phenomenological approach was taken drawing on 45 qualitative interviews that were conducted in and around Tate Modern and the Southbank Centre during autumn 2009. Findings: four audience groups were identified segmented by their motivations, experiences and feelings about the two buildings. The first group ‘Place to see’ visit Tate Modern and the Southbank Centre to attend exhibitions and performances. The second meet friends and spend time in the cafes and bars using them as a ‘Place to hang-out and meet’. The third group use the buildings as a ‘Place to drop-in’ on their way to somewhere else. The fourth group use the SBC as a ‘Third Place’, to study, for meetings, to read, escape and rejuvenate. Research Limitations: This was an exploratory study. Further research is required to test the findings in other art museums, arts venues, libraries, parks and other public and private spaces within communities. Originality/value: This paper fills a gap by drawing on the ‘Third Place’ literature to explore the consumption of art museums and venues. It provides us with {{a better understanding of the}} meanings these public buildings have to individuals, the way they are used by the public and how arts managers might attract new audiences from their communities. It also provides insights for planners and <b>town</b> <b>centre</b> <b>managers</b> as to the types of places individuals are seeking during their daily lives...|$|R
40|$|The {{high street}} and the retail sector are facing a period of flux with {{tremendous}} pressures from local, national and global consumer trends, including rapid changes in the fiscal climate affecting local authorities. This situation has become particularly acute since the global economic downturn of 2008, which many see as {{the start of a}} significant long term global restructuring or the world’s economy. Building on the findings of recent Government thinking, including the “Understanding high street performance” report by Genecon and the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills published in 2012, this study argues for a fresh approach to the situation faced by the retail sector, the high street and, more generally, <b>town</b> <b>centres</b> across the country. Instead of a reactive approach to consumer trends, this report argues for a re-think of the strategic positioning of <b>town</b> <b>centres</b> to reclaim them to their rightful position and role as places that serve their communities, visitors, businesses and key stakeholders with a quality of experience that encourages them to keep coming back, staying longer and becoming local residents in due course. In line with this, the achievement of prosperity for <b>town</b> <b>centres</b> is aligned here with their strategic aspirations, and ability to satisfy changing demands, which this report suggests includes a holistic approach to the integration and management of the daytime, evening and night time economies. These three segments of the 24 -hr economy should be seen as part of one menu that <b>town</b> <b>centres</b> offer in an economy increasingly driven by customer experience and perceptions. To achieve this, key <b>town</b> <b>centre</b> decision makers - who should include the business community as well as local residents - need first to establish a vision for the future of their <b>town</b> <b>centre</b> that is anchored in the ‘personality’ or unique characteristics of their town, sometimes referred to as the ‘DNA’ of the place. The aims of this study are to: 1. Present a set of tools that will help places of different sizes (from small market towns to large city centres and potentially also villages and rural locations) to plot a locally tailor-made strategic road map towards prosperity informed by their stakeholders. 2. Develop and present a state-of-the-art <b>Town</b> <b>Centre</b> Classification Matrix linked to a ‘personality’ test for <b>town</b> <b>centres.</b> This tool, which can be used for individual retailers and businesses as well as entire towns and tourist destinations, represents the first stage of strategic positioning and includes key elements of perceptions among visitors, residents and businesses. 3. Develop and present a new and clear national performance framework for <b>town</b> <b>centres</b> is presented. This framework is linked to the <b>Town</b> <b>Centre</b> Classification Matrix and allows places to evaluate their current situation and to monitor progress towards their strategic vision or objectives. This is achieved through a ground-breaking approach that effectively demystifies the concept of <b>town</b> <b>centre</b> performance indicators. Each indicator is explained in an approachable manner with data collection methodologies that include the possibility of using commercially available data or adopting a do-it-yourself method to field research locally. 4. Empower and support communities, Town Teams, Portas Pilots, local authority representatives, businesses operating in or near <b>town</b> <b>centres,</b> trader organisations, Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs), <b>town</b> <b>centre</b> <b>managers,</b> business improvement district managers, policy makers, town planners, charities, national retail associations, shopping <b>centre</b> <b>managers,</b> urban regeneration practitioners, tourism officers, consultancies and researchers. 5. Help locations and centres of all sizes to make key investment decisions adopting a strategic approach using decision support tools (including key performance indicators) that enable decision makers to prioritise and deal with local issues effectively. Additionally, the indicators used in this study also support users who wish to do so in pursuing further market research avenues {{to gain a better understanding}} of their <b>town</b> <b>centre</b> and the complexity of interactions between different parameters. This includes the differences that may exist in some places between facts and perceptions (e. g. reported retail crime versus perceptions of crime and safety in the <b>town</b> <b>centre).</b> As in any change management context, it is vital to know the facts so that informed decisions can be taken to prioritise available resources effectively. Based on the findings of this study, there follow ten key recommendations for further action from central government, LEPs, the retail sector and key local decision makers: 1. The role of retail and other businesses (e. g. leisure) in <b>town</b> <b>centres</b> should be revised to adopt a more holistic approach bringing the daytime, evening and night time economies under a common umbrella of strategic positioning and performance. 2. The national performance framework for <b>town</b> <b>centres</b> and <b>Town</b> <b>Centre</b> Classification Matrix presented here should be adopted nationally as part of a wider package to support ailing high streets and <b>town</b> <b>centres.</b> 3. A National Observatory for <b>Town</b> <b>Centre</b> Prosperity should be created for the UK, based on the <b>Town</b> <b>Centre</b> Performance Barometer Toolkit presented here. This national observatory should act as a common database of best practice and avoid simplistic benchmarking or league table approaches. Instead, it should focus on the sharing of innovative and entrepreneurial practices adopted by different <b>town</b> <b>centres</b> to achieve prosperity through inclusive and strategic partnership approaches at all levels. 4. A long term analysis of UK <b>town</b> <b>centre</b> prosperity trends should be carried out on the basis of field data collected using the performance criteria presented in this study. Whilst the indicator-based <b>Town</b> <b>Centre</b> Performance Barometer Toolkit is adequate for a first snap shot of the issues affecting different <b>town</b> <b>centres</b> today, it will only provide limited assistance to locations unless trends can be developed for each indicator through continuous use over a longer time frame. 5. The role of effective and genuine partnership-based place management as a key mechanism in the strategic visioning and delivery of prosperous <b>town</b> <b>centres</b> of all sizes should be recognised and supported by central and local government, urban regeneration professionals, LEPs and key local decision makers. This should apply not only to the operational management of <b>town</b> <b>centres</b> but, crucially, to key decisions affecting their development, including major interventions and regeneration projects with an impact on future growth prospects. 6. The effectiveness of current place management models (including Town Teams, Portas Pilots and Business Improvement Districts, among others) should be investigated further with due attention to place management practice overseas to establish more focused support interventions from the public and private sectors in achieving better results in each case without reinventing the wheel. 7. The impact of high performing <b>town</b> and city <b>centres</b> on neighbouring smaller centres should be investigated further, particularly by LEPs, taking a regional network and impact approach to avoid a polarisation of resources towards a (limited number of) high performing <b>town</b> or city <b>centres</b> or the squandering of resources on duplication in a small geographic area. Similarly, governance issues affecting LEPs and local councils in areas (including <b>town</b> <b>centres)</b> located on different local authority boundaries should be addressed as part of a wider framework. 8. The interactions between <b>town</b> <b>centre</b> performance parameters and their cause-effect relationships should be researched further as there is currently a limited level of evidence and understanding of these beyond relatively simple one-to-one (and not one-to-many) relationships. 9. A better understanding of consumer behaviour within the <b>town</b> <b>centre</b> ecosystem needs to be achieved at both macro and micro level in order to better support long-term decision making for their effective strategic positioning. This study offers a first step towards this by highlighting the importance of visitor perceptions but does not address the deeper and more complex mechanisms that govern the development of these perceptions. 10. The national observatory recommended above should develop further the indicator-based toolkit presented here to create indices linked to a weighting system for individual indicators derived from an extensive nation-wide field research programme on <b>town</b> <b>centre</b> prosperity...|$|R

Following exploratory semi‐structured interviews with <b>town</b> centre‐based shopping <b>centre</b> <b>managers,</b> the main {{stage of the}} research comprised a postal questionnaire. This investigated two main areas: {{the nature of the}} process by which marketing/promotional activities were planned; and the actual “marketing” activities used by respondents (and their perceived importance), with particular reference to marketing communications activities.

The results are structured using Shimp's categories of general choices, specific choices and programme evaluation. Regarding general choices (i. e. targeting, objectives budgeting), centre positioning was regarded as very important and key target audiences were general public and media at the local/regional level. Objectives focused on raising centre profile and improving footfall. Centres spent an average of 13. 6 per cent of operating budget on promotional activities. With regard to specific choices (i. e. mixing communication elements, creating messages), the most widely used promotional elements were found to be press and radio advertising, events and festivals, leaflets and other promotional literature and also public relations. Evidence of integration between communications elements existed although there is potential for greater synergy...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{evaluate}} (i) the segmented appeal of a <b>town</b> <b>centre's</b> separately branded environments; (ii) the role of digital signage in contributing to the atmospherics of a town, building on environmental psychology theory, drawing support from the Limited Capacity Model of Mediated Message Processing (LCM) and (iii) the segmented appeal of digital signage. The method consisted of a survey of actual shoppers (n= 530) in a real shopping environment. Shopper market segments included demographics plus post hoc importance motivation. The article also evaluates shoppers’ perceptions of digital signage, that is, screens in a public place showing video. The study finds that separately marketable parts of the town have differentiated brand images and appeal to different market segments of shoppers. A modern mall appeals to younger, affluent consumers and includes digital signage, which appeals to these same market segments. Results build on environmental psychology theory, extending LCM from television to digital signage, confirming effectiveness as an atmospheric stimulus. Further research needs a longitudinal study to examine causality, other stimuli and contexts. There are two practical implications: (i) <b>town</b> <b>centre</b> and mall <b>managers</b> can separately position the brands of different parts of a town to better satisfy differing market segments of customers; (ii) digital signage is a recent addition to the atmospherics toolbox, with segmented appeal and future capability of adjustment of content for differing market segments. The research is original in that it (i) presents empirical support for significant differences between shopper market segments and their responses to marketer-driven stimuli; (ii) adds to understanding of psychological processes by which atmospheric stimuli increase purchasing behaviour, by adding digital signage to the short list of empirically supported stimuli and (iii) builds on environmental psychology theory, clarifying partial mediating effects of positive affect and moderating effects of age/employment status and shopping motivations...|$|R
