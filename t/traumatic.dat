5|$|Furthermore, {{acetylcysteine}} {{has been}} confirmed, {{in a recent}} double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted by the US military, to reduce the effects of blast induced mild <b>traumatic</b> brain and neurological injury in soldiers. Multiple animal studies have also demonstrated its efficacy in reducing the damage associated with moderate <b>traumatic</b> brain or spinal injury, and also ischemia-induced brain injury. In particular, it has been demonstrated through multiple studies to significantly reduce neuronal losses and to improve cognitive and neurological outcomes associated with these <b>traumatic</b> events. Acetylcysteine has been safely used to treat paracetamol overdose for over forty years and is extensively used in emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|Measurement of {{predictive}} visual tracking {{is being}} studied as a screening technique to identify mild <b>traumatic</b> brain injury. A head-mounted display unit with eye-tracking capability shows a moving object in a predictive pattern {{for the person}} to follow with their eyes. People without brain injury {{will be able to}} track the moving object with smooth pursuit eye movements and correct trajectory while it is hypothesized that those with mild <b>traumatic</b> brain injury cannot.|$|E
5|$|Subarachnoid blood can be {{detected}} on CT scanning {{in as many as}} 60 percent of people with <b>traumatic</b> brain injury. <b>Traumatic</b> SAH (tSAH) usually occurs near the site of a skull fracture or intracerebral contusion. It usually happens in the setting of other forms of <b>traumatic</b> brain injury and has been linked with a poorer prognosis. It is unclear, however, if this {{is a direct result of}} the SAH or whether the presence of subarachnoid blood is simply an indicator of severity of the head injury and the prognosis is determined by other associated mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} {{vertebral}} artery dissection can be grouped under two main categories, spontaneous and <b>traumatic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{head trauma}} {{is thought to}} be influenced in part by the location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding. It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects of <b>traumatic</b> brain injury; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis or whether it is merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred. People with moderate and severe <b>traumatic</b> brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the risk of dying as those who do not. They also have a higher risk of severe disability and persistent vegetative state, and <b>traumatic</b> SAH has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post <b>traumatic</b> epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and longer stays in the intensive care unit. However, more than 90 percent of people with <b>traumatic</b> subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome.|$|E
5|$|An early {{description}} of <b>traumatic</b> pneumothorax secondary to rib fractures appears in Imperial Surgery by Turkish surgeon Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu (1385–1468), which also recommends {{a method of}} simple aspiration.|$|E
5|$|At 16, Barr {{was hit by}} a {{car that}} left her with a <b>traumatic</b> brain injury. Her {{behavior}} changed so radically that she was institutionalized for eight months at Utah State Hospital. While institutionalized she had a baby, which she gave up for adoption.|$|E
5|$|Brain damage, {{or disease}} of the brain can {{manifest}} {{in a wide variety}} of ways. <b>Traumatic</b> brain injury, for example in contact sport, after a fall, or in traffic or work accidents, can be associated with both immediate and longer-term problems. Immediate problems that develop may include bleeding within the skull, compressing the brain tissue or damaging its blood supply, skull fractures, injury to a particular area, deafness, and concussion. In addition to the site of injury, the opposite side of the brain may be affected, termed a contrecoup injury. Longer-term issues that may develop include post-traumatic stress, hydrocephalus, and chronic <b>traumatic</b> encephalopathy.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral Palsy: Athletes with non-progressive brain damage, {{for example}} {{cerebral}} palsy, <b>traumatic</b> brain injury, stroke or similar disabilities affecting muscle control, balance or coordination.|$|E
5|$|Concussion, {{also known}} as minor head trauma or mild <b>traumatic</b> brain injury (mTBI) {{is the most common}} type of <b>traumatic</b> brain injury. It is {{typically}} defined as a head injury with a temporary loss of brain function. Symptoms include a variety of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, which may not be recognized if subtle. A variety of signs accompany concussion including headache, feeling in a fog, and emotional changeability. In general, the signs can be categorized into physical signs (such as loss of consciousness or amnesia), behavioral changes (such as irritability), cognitive impairment (such as slowed reaction times), and sleep disturbances. Fewer than 10% of sports-related concussions among children are associated with loss of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Definitions of mild <b>traumatic</b> {{brain injury}} (MTBI) were {{inconsistent}} until the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) provided a consistent, authoritative definition across specialties in 1992.|$|E
5|$|For many {{communities}} {{the existence of}} buildings that formerly housed residential schools are a <b>traumatic</b> reminder of the system's legacy, {{and there has been}} much discussion about demolition, heritage status and how the possibility of incorporating sites into the healing process.|$|E
5|$|Non-human animals may {{experience}} both spontaneous and <b>traumatic</b> pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax is, as in humans, classified as primary or secondary, while <b>traumatic</b> pneumothorax {{is divided into}} open and closed (with or without chest wall damage). The diagnosis may be apparent to the veterinary physician because the animal exhibits difficulty breathing in, or has shallow breathing. Pneumothoraces may arise from lung lesions (such as bullae) or from trauma to the chest wall. In horses, <b>traumatic</b> pneumothorax may involve both hemithoraces, as the mediastinum is incomplete {{and there is a}} direct connection between the two halves of the chest. Tension pneumothorax – the presence of which may be suspected due to rapidly deteriorating heart function, absent lung sounds throughout the thorax, and a barrel-shaped chest – is treated with an incision in the animal's chest to relieve the pressure, followed by insertion of a chest tube.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that people with a {{previous}} <b>traumatic</b> brain injury, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (a type of stroke) or radiation therapy involving the head have a higher risk of hypopituitarism. After <b>traumatic</b> brain injury, as much as a quarter have persistent pituitary hormone deficiencies. Many of these people may have subtle or non-specific symptoms that are not linked to pituitary problems but attributed to their previous condition. It is therefore possible that many cases of hypopituitarism remain undiagnosed, and that the annual incidence would rise to 31 per 100,000 annually if people from these risk groups were to be tested.|$|E
5|$|TBI is a {{major cause}} of death and {{disability}} worldwide, especially in children and young adults. Males sustain <b>traumatic</b> brain injuries more frequently than do females. The 20thcentury saw developments in diagnosis and treatment that decreased death rates and improved outcome.|$|E
5|$|There are {{fundamental}} {{problems at the}} Veterans Health Administration of staffing being inadequate for aging Vietnam veterans and for more recent veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan who may have complex health challenges such as <b>traumatic</b> brain injury, multiple limb amputations and prosthetics, diabetes and post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E
5|$|There is {{one case}} study on maltreated twins {{published}} in 1999 with a follow-up in 2006. This study assessed the twins {{between the ages of}} 19 and 36 months, during which time they suffered multiple moves and placements. The paper explores the similarities, differences and comorbidity of RAD, disorganized attachment and post <b>traumatic</b> stress disorder. The girl showed signs of the inhibited form of RAD while the boy showed signs of the indiscriminate form. It was noted that the diagnosis of RAD ameliorated with better care but symptoms of post <b>traumatic</b> stress disorder and signs of disorganized attachment came and went as the infants progressed through multiple placement changes. At age three, some lasting relationship disturbance was evident.|$|E
5|$|<b>Traumatic</b> {{brain injury}} may cause {{a range of}} serious {{coincidental}} complications that include cardiac arrhythmias and neurogenic pulmonary edema. These conditions must be adequately treated and stabilised {{as part of the}} core care for these patients.|$|E
5|$|<b>Traumatic</b> {{pneumothorax}} {{most commonly}} {{occurs when the}} chest wall is pierced, such as when a stab wound or gunshot wound allows air to enter the pleural space, or because some other mechanical injury to the lung compromises {{the integrity of the}} involved structures. <b>Traumatic</b> pneumothoraces have been found to occur in up to half of all cases of chest trauma, with only rib fractures being more common in this group. The pneumothorax can be occult (not readily apparent) in half of these cases, but may enlarge - particularly if mechanical ventilation is required. They are also encountered in patients already receiving mechanical ventilation for some other reason.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{pneumothorax}} is {{one that}} occurs without an apparent cause {{and in the absence}} of significant lung disease, while a secondary pneumothorax occurs in the presence of existing lung disease. Smoking increases the risk as do lung diseases including COPD, asthma, and tuberculosis. A pneumothorax can also be caused by physical trauma to the chest (including a blast injury), or as a complication of a healthcare intervention; in which case it is called a <b>traumatic</b> pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying {{injuries}} often play a {{key role}} in the outcome. Injuries that may accompany TBI include pulmonary contusion and laceration; and fractures of the sternum, ribs and clavicles. Spinal cord injury, facial trauma, <b>traumatic</b> aortic rupture, injuries to the abdomen, lung, and head are present in 40–100%. The most common accompanying injury is esophageal perforation or rupture (known as Boerhaave syndrome), which occurs in as many as 43% of the penetrating injuries to the neck that cause tracheal injury.|$|E
5|$|Although {{multiple}} definitions exist, {{a tension}} pneumothorax {{is generally considered}} to be present when a pneumothorax (primary spontaneous, secondary spontaneous, or <b>traumatic)</b> leads to significant impairment of respiration and/or blood circulation. Tension pneumothorax tends to occur in clinical situations such as ventilation, resuscitation, trauma, or in patients with lung disease.|$|E
5|$|Aspiration {{may also}} be {{considered}} in secondary pneumothorax of moderate size (air rim 1–2cm) without breathlessness, with the difference that ongoing observation in hospital is required even after a successful procedure. American professional guidelines state that all large pneumothoraces – even those due to PSP – should be treated with a chest tube. Moderately sized iatrogenic <b>traumatic</b> pneumothoraces (due to medical procedures) may initially be treated with aspiration.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third day of the trial, Wiens incurred a self-inflicted injury by banging his head against a table. He was diagnosed with haematomas and a suspected <b>traumatic</b> brain injury, but was judged fit to stand trial after a hospital-based medical examination. While continuing with noncompliant and destructive behaviour, Wiens was temporarily restrained by nine security officers in court.|$|E
5|$|Birdy is a 1984 American drama film {{based on}} William Wharton's 1978 {{novel of the}} same name. Directed by Alan Parker, it stars Matthew Modine and Nicolas Cage. The film focuses on the {{friendship}} between Birdy (Modine) and Al Columbato (Cage), two teenage boys living in a working-class neighborhood in 1960s Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The story is presented in flashbacks, with a frame narrative depicting Birdy and Al's <b>traumatic</b> experiences upon serving in the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Born a slave in Dorchester County, Maryland, Tubman {{was beaten}} and whipped by her various masters as a child. Early in life, she {{suffered}} a <b>traumatic</b> head wound when an irate slave owner threw a heavy metal weight intending to hit another slave and hit her instead. The injury caused dizziness, pain, and spells of hypersomnia, which occurred throughout her life. She was a devout Christian and experienced strange visions and vivid dreams, which she ascribed to premonitions from God.|$|E
5|$|During 1894 Olga's father became {{increasingly}} ill, {{and the annual}} trip to Denmark was cancelled. On 13 November 1894, he {{died at the age}} of 49. The emotional impact on Olga, aged only 12, was <b>traumatic,</b> and her eldest brother, the new Tsar Nicholas II, was propelled into a role for which in Olga's later opinion he was ill-prepared.|$|E
5|$|Following Freud's early speculations about infant {{experience}} with the mother, Otto Rank suggested a powerful role in personality development for birth trauma. Rank stressed the <b>traumatic</b> experience of birth as a separation from the mother, rather than birth as an uncomfortable physical event. Not long after Rank's introduction of this idea, Ian Suttie, a British physician whose early death limited his influence, suggested that the child's basic need is for mother-love, and his greatest anxiety is that such love will be lost.|$|E
5|$|He began {{experiencing}} <b>traumatic</b> dreams {{dominated by}} the colour white, and seeking to explain them he visited Franz Ricklin, a psychoanalyst who was a student of Carl Jung in Zurich in May 1959. In February 1960 he returned to Switzerland, and upon its arrival back in Brussels he began renting an apartment in Uccle, away from Germaine. His relationship with Germaine had ended, although due to restrictions under Belgian law {{he was unable to}} obtain a divorce until seventeen years later.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Hu Die had her {{big break}} {{when she was}} signed by Tianyi (Unique) Film Company, {{one of the major}} studios of Shanghai, headed by Runje Shaw (Shao Zuiweng). Tianyi catered to the tastes of the common people with rapid {{production}} of films. Hu Die starred in 15 films within the two years she worked for Tianyi. Many of them, such as The <b>Traumatic</b> Romance of Liang and Zhu (1926) and Lady Meng Jiang (1927), were popular, but not considered artistically worthy.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, when Ryder was 12, she {{enrolled}} at the American Conservatory Theater in nearby San Francisco, where she took her first acting lessons. In 1989, Ryder graduated from Petaluma High School with a 4.0 GPA. She suffers from aquaphobia because of a <b>traumatic</b> near-drowning at age 12. This caused problems with the underwater scenes in Alien Resurrection (1997), some of {{which had to be}} reshot numerous times.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, Schumacher {{suffered}} a <b>traumatic</b> brain injury in a skiing accident. He {{was placed in}} a medically induced coma for six months until 16 June 2014. He left the hospital in Grenoble for further rehabilitation at the University Hospital of Lausanne. On 9 September 2014, Schumacher was relocated to his home where he continues to receive medical treatment and rehabilitation privately.|$|E
5|$|In early 2001, the Workshop {{conducted}} a summative study {{about the effects}} of war, natural disasters, and other events on young children. It demonstrated that little was being done to address the fears and concerns of victims of <b>traumatic</b> events. As a result, the Workshop developed a series of materials it believed would help children (and their families) cope with events such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation of {{the thyroid}} is called thyroiditis. Inflamed thyroids may cause {{symptoms}} of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Two types thyroiditis initially present with hyperthyroidism and are sometimes {{followed by a}} period of hypothyroidism – Hashimoto's thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis. There are other disorders that cause inflammation of the thyroid, and these include subacute thyroiditis, acute thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis, Riedel's thyroiditis and <b>traumatic</b> injury, including palpation thyroiditis.|$|E
5|$|Koufax jammed his {{pitching}} arm in August while diving back {{to second}} base {{to beat a}} pick-off throw. He managed to pitch and win two more games. However, the morning after his 19th win, a shutout in which he struck out 13 batters, he could not straighten his arm. He was diagnosed by Dodgers' team physician Robert Kerlan with <b>traumatic</b> arthritis. With the Dodgers out of the pennant race, the book was closed on Koufax and his 19–5 record.|$|E
5|$|Of the 296 {{people on}} board, 111 {{died in the}} crash. Most were killed by {{injuries}} sustained in the multiple impacts, but 35 {{people in the middle}} fuselage section directly above the fuel tanks died from smoke inhalation in the post-crash fire. Of those, 24 had no <b>traumatic</b> blunt-force injuries. The majority of the 185 survivors were seated behind first class and ahead of the wings. Many passengers were able to walk out through the ruptures to the structure.|$|E
