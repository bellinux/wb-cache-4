Laboratory tests can also be performed to identify possible causes of secondary hypertension, and to determine whether hypertension has caused damage to the heart, eyes, and kidneys. Additional tests for diabetes and high cholesterol levels are usually performed because these conditions are additional risk factors for the development of heart disease and may require treatment.|$|E

However, hospital-based studies on cardiovascular diseases including hypertension in a developing country like Nepal have been limited. Objective: The objective {{of the present study}} was to determine the life style of patients before and after diagnosis of hypertension. Methods: A total of 100 adult hypertensive patients over 30 years of age who were attending in medical out patients department within 6 month to 2 years after first diagnosis of hypertension in Shahid Gangalal National Heart Centre and Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, in Kathmandu, Nepal, in April 2009, using a descriptive research design. The data was collected by interview using a questionnaire consisting of a combination of structured and semistructured questions. The data was analyzed by using SPSS 11. 5 version. Results: This study found the respondents’ knowledge regarding hypertension was poor. Regarding life style of hypertensive patients, majorities (90 %) of them were non-vegetarian before diagnosis but after diagnosis of hypertension the percentage of non-vegetarian was reduced by 10 %. Similarly, the reduction in consumption of meat, eggs, ghee and oil (mustard, sunflower) by hypertensive patients was statistically significant difference (p = 0. 000) after <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension.</b> Regarding soyabean oil consumption, additional salty food and amount of salt intake there was no statistical significant difference before and after <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension.</b> Likewise, physical exercise and stress reduction activities performed by hypertensive patients and change in drinking alcohol and smoking was found to be statistically significant difference (p = 0. 000) after <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension.</b> Conclusion: The adverse consequences of hypertension can be reduced by modifying the life style.

40|$|AbstractAccurate blood {{pressure}} measurement {{is critical to}} properly identify and treat individuals with hypertension. In 2005, the Canadian Hypertension Education Program produced a revised algorithm {{to be used for}} <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension.</b> Subsequent annual reviews of the literature have identified 2 major deficiencies in the current diagnostic process. First, auscultatory measurements performed in routine clinical settings have serious accuracy limitations that have not been overcome despite great efforts to educate health care professionals over several years. Thus, alternatives to auscultatory measurements should be used. Second, recent data indicate that patients with white coat hypertension must be identified earlier in the process and in a systematic manner rather than on an ad hoc or voluntary basis so they are not unnecessarily treated with antihypertensive medications. The economic and health consequences of white coat hypertension are reviewed. In this article evidence for a revised algorithm to diagnose hypertension is presented. Protocols for home {{blood pressure}} measurement and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring are reviewed. The role of automated office blood pressure measurement is updated. The revised algorithm strongly encourages the use of validated electronic digital oscillometric devices and recommends that out-of-office blood pressure measurements, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (preferred), or home blood pressure measurement, should be performed to confirm <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension...</b>|$|E
40|$|Age, sex, {{hypertension}} and dietary sodium are proposed to affect plasma and urinary catecholamines. Yet no prior study {{has examined the}} simultaneous effects of these factors within the same study population, so results may have been confounded by factors not determined. We investigate, for the first time, the impact of simultaneously determined predictors of plasma and urinary catecholamines, {{and the relationship of}} catecholamines with <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension.</b> Hypertensive and normotensive subjects (n= 308) were studied off antihypertensives in liberal and low sodium balance. Twenty-four hour urinary catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine) were measured. Plasma catecholamines were measured supine after overnight fast. Repeated measures multivariate linear regression models examined effect of sex, race, age, body mass index, dietary salt (liberal salt vs. low salt), hypertension status, and mean arterial pressure on plasma and urinary catecholamines. Logistic regression determined the relationship of catecholamines with diagnosis of hypertension. Dietary sodium restriction and increasing age predicted increased plasma and urinary norepinephrine, with sodium restriction having greatest effect. Female sex predicted lower urinary and plasma epinephrine. Neither plasma nor urinary catecholamines predicted <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension.</b> In summary, specific demographic factors variably impact catecholamines and should be considered when assessing catecholamines in research and clinical settings.

40|$|In {{a recent}} issue of blood {{pressure}} monitoring, Maric et al. reported the results of an interesting study in which blood pressure was measured in 780 children between 7 and 17 years of age in two schools of the district of Vozdovac of Belgrade, Serbia. The authors reported a prevalence of elevated blood pressure of 10. 5 % and concluded that there was a high prevalence of hypertension in (this) sample of schoolchildren'. In this commentary, we would like to stress the importance of distinguishing elevated blood pressure from hypertension. Hypertension is a state of sustained elevated blood pressure. This means that blood pressure must be elevated on repeated occasions for <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> Individuals with high blood pressure at one visit, however, generally have lower blood pressure levels at subsequent visits because of familiarization with the measurement procedure and a regression to the mean effect. Therefore, if blood pressure is high at an initial visit, it is necessary to measure blood pressure at other visits to confirm or exclude hypertension. According to the guidelines of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on Children and Adolescents, elevated blood pressure must be confirmed on at least three visits before characterizing a child as having hypertension'. It is also recommended to have blood pressure measured at more than one visit for <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> in adults...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the relative accuracy of clinic measurements and home blood pressure monitoring compared with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring {{as a reference}} standard for <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension.</b> DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis with hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic models. Methodological quality was appraised, including evidence of validation of blood pressure measurement equipment. DATA SOURCES: Medline (from 1966), Embase (from 1980), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, Medion, ARIF, and TRIP up to May 2010. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Eligible studies examined diagnosis of hypertension in adults of all ages using home and/or clinic blood pressure measurement compared with those made using ambulatory monitoring that clearly defined thresholds to diagnose hypertension. RESULTS: The 20 eligible studies used various thresholds for <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension,</b> and only seven studies (clinic) and three studies (home) could be directly compared with ambulatory monitoring. Compared with ambulatory monitoring thresholds of 135 / 85 mm Hg, clinic measurements over 140 / 90 mm Hg had mean sensitivity and specificity of 74. 6 % (95 % confidence interval 60. 7 % to 84. 8 %) and 74. 6 % (47. 9 % to 90. 4 %), respectively, whereas home measurements over 135 / 85 mm Hg had mean sensitivity and specificity of 85. 7 % (78. 0 % to 91. 0 %) and 62. 4 % (48. 0 % to 75. 0 %). CONCLUSIONS: Neither clinic nor home measurement had sufficient sensitivity or specificity to be recommended as a single diagnostic test.

Piecewise linear regression was used to calculate the average annual increase in rates, before and after 1999. Between 1994 and 2003, the percentage of adult Canadians aware of being diagnosed with hypertension increased by 51 % (from 12. 37 % to 18. 74 %; P 0. 001), and the percentage prescribed antihypertensive drugs increased by 66 % (from 9. 57 % to 15. 86 %; P 0. 001). After 1999, there was approximately a doubling of the annual rate of increase in <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> (from 0. 52 % of the population per year before 1999 to 1. 03 % per year after 1999; P 0. 001) and the percentage prescribed antihypertensive drugs (from 0. 54 % of the population per year before 1999 versus 0. 98 % per year after 1999; P 0. 001).
