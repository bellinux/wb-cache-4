25|$|For {{much of the}} war Wilson had a poor {{relationship}} with Haig, although relations eased somewhat when Wilson became CIGS. Esher {{said that he was}} always loyal to the man he was serving, and Walter Reid believes Wilson did not actively plot against Haig. When French asked Wilson, late in 1915, if he had heard of Haig, Rawlinson and Gough intriguing against him, Wilson replied, perhaps somewhat naively, that “Haig was too good a fellow” for <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> Wilson wrote of Haig (21 December 1915, when appointing him to a corps command) “He was quite nice but he is always foreign to me”. After the disaster of 1 July 1916 Wilson wrote (5 July) that Haig was “a good stout hearted defensive soldier with no imagination & very little brains & very little sympathy”. That same day Foch, who had declined an invitation from Haig to lunch with Wilson, thought Haig “was stupid & lacked stomach for the fight” which Wilson thought “not quite fair”.|$|E

500|$|Deep Blue Sea was {{inspired}} by Australian screenwriter Duncan Kennedy after he witnessed a [...] "horrific" [...] shark attack on a beach near his home. The tragedy contributed to a recurring nightmare of him [...] "being in a passageway with sharks that could read his mind". This motivated him to write a spec script, while acknowledging the challenge of approaching a shark movie without repeating Steven Spielberg's 1975 classic Jaws. Although Warner Bros. bought the script in late 1994, actual development on the project did not start until two years later. When Renny Harlin was chosen to direct the film, Kennedy's screenplay, which had already been re-written by several writers at Warner Bros., was presented to Donna Powers and Wayne Powers, who turned it into the film's final script. According to Wayne, [...] "The movie became essentially what we wrote.

500|$|The {{formulation}} of Russell as an Asian American character, {{along with the}} casting of an Asian American in the role was met positively as well.

EWP lauded Pixar {{for the creation of}} the character, stating, [...] "We are proud to honor a very progressive film company like Pixar who cast an Asian American character alongside an elderly one to play the leads in a feature film." [...] The character is noted as Pixar's first lead Asian character, and was further positively received within the added context of historical non-Asian castings for Asian roles in entertainment. Asian American organizations and entertainment websites, such as media watchdog Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA), Racebending.com, and Angry Asian Man praised the character and Pixar for its diverse character depictions, noting the general lack of Asian American lead characters and Asian actors cast in entertainment. In an interview with NPR in 2013, Angry Asian Mans Phil Yu reflected on the character's lack of typical Asian stereotyping, stating, [...] "You know, he just happens to be Asian and he's, you know, really adorable character. But that kid could've been of any ethnicity but they made the effort to make him Asian - just a little color, you know, and it's really wonderful when <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> happens where they don't have to play that up and make it like a thing or a joke, which happens a lot." ...|$|E

[...] Former The Star-Ledger columnist Alan Sepinwall expressed a negative perspective on the episode, deeming it childish and ridiculous. He disliked Rhimes' conception of the story arc involving Stevens, elaborating, [...] "If there's a doctor on this show who should be forced to repeat their intern year, if only to prevent them from being allowed to influence younger doctors, it's Izzie, not George. She proves her unfitness for this role with her first patient of the day, the deer. Not cute, not character-illuminating, just dumb." [...] Also criticized was Torres, whose regression from a [...] "cool, rocking, outgoing, cofident and full of life" [...] role was highlighted, receiving negative feedback from Sepinwall, who wrote [...] "Now the character exists entirely so the writers can dump on her, in a devolution far worse than anything. I just don't get it, and it pains me to watch any scene with Callie in it. Despite expressing a negative outlook on Meredith's story arc which dealt with Shepherd, noting that the [...] "constant break-ups and reunions are as silly as if Shonda Rhimes had just kept them apart for three seasons before letting them kiss", Sepinwall was favorable of Lexie's arrival at Seattle Grace, feeling that [...] "she's still being written as Meredith circa season one in an attempt to make us like her, but I didn't mind the manipulation, if only because there are so few characters left on this show to like." [...] The Buzzsugar television reviewer was mainly critical of the episode, describing it as a departure from [...] "the old show".

The Derek/Rose relationship received negative reviews, with Burrows stating that it was [...] "emotional, but not remarkable". Jack Florey of IndieLondon reviewed the characters, stating that their behaviour is the show's biggest problem: [...] "the self-absorbed, pretentious and frequently selfish attitudes that drive the surgeons at the centre of Grey’s exasperate more than reward." [...] As for the storylines, Foley stated that they didn't [...] "ring true" [...] and that [...] "the plot devices became increasingly clunky", noting the lack of realism in arcs such as George and Callie's marriage and the Izzie's affair [...] "as a means of ripping it apart". Florrey also commented on Meredith Grey's arc, by stating that she turned into [...] "one of the most selfish, self-centered characters on television", whereas Mark Sloan's storyline was named [...] "sex-obsessed, borderline misogynistic and close to scandalous". Daniel Fienberg of Zap2It said [...] "One of the season's best performances came from Emmy-nominated guest star Elizabeth Reaser." [...] Pajiba TV reviewed Reaser's performance by stating that it [...] "has been one of the only good things that show's had going for it anymore."
