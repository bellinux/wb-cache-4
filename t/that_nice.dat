25|$|The Badgers first road game of {{the season}} was a hot one as the game time {{temperature}} was 98 degrees. Arizona State's opening drive took them down to the Wisconsin 3-yard line but on fourth and two the Sun Devils went for it but failed. Both offenses struggled for most of the first quarter until the Sun Devils kicked a 34-yard field goal with 4:08 left in the first quarter. The Badgers then put a 10-play 73-yard drive together that took 5:22 and into the second quarter. The Badgers capped <b>that</b> <b>nice</b> drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass from QB Joel Stave to TE Jacob Pedersen. On the next drive, the Sun Devils had a three-and-out. Arizona State attempted to punt the ball but because of a bad snap, Wisconsin's DT Beau Allen recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchdown giving the Badgers a 14–3 lead. Arizona State answered right back with a 10-play 75-yard scoring drive capped by a 2-yard touchdown run by RB Marion Grice. The Sun Devils added a 19-yard field goal before the half cutting the Wisconsin lead to 14–13.|$|E
500|$|American Pharoah's gentle {{demeanor}} is also distinctive, {{in that he}} is fond {{of people}} and, particularly for a young racehorse, surprisingly calm around them. As Baffert explained, [...] "Horses of his caliber are not <b>that</b> <b>nice</b> and sweet. They're just sort of tough. If I brought Bayern out here, you can't get near him, he's too aggressive. 's just so different than any horse I've ever had." [...] He was not always so calm, described initially as [...] "a {{little bit of a}} headcase," [...] but Baffert explained that after his anxiety-ridden first race, people worked with him, schooling him in the track paddock for about two weeks, when [...] "all the sudden he got really sweet and really mellow." ...|$|E
500|$|Since my {{work was}} announced, several Lives and Memoirs of Dr. Johnson have been published, the most voluminous {{of which is}} one {{compiled}} for the booksellers of London, by Sir John Hawkins, Knight, a man, whom, during my long intimacy with Dr. Johnson, I never saw in his company, I think but once, and I am sure not above twice. Johnson might have esteemed him for his decent, religious demeanour, and his knowledge of books and literary history; but from the rigid formalities of his manners, {{it is evident that}} they never could have lived together with companionable ease and familiarity; nor had Sir John Hawkins <b>that</b> <b>nice</b> perception which was necessary to mark the finer and less obvious parts of Johnson's character. His being appointed one of his executors, gave him an opportunity of taking possession of such fragments of a diary and other papers as were left; of which, before delivering them up to the residuary legatee, whose property they were, he endeavoured to extract the substance. In this he has not been very successful, as I have found upon a perusal of those papers, which have been since transferred to me. Sir John Hawkins's ponderous labours, I must acknowledge, exhibit a farrago, of which a considerable portion is not devoid of entertainment to the lovers of literary gossipping; but besides its being swelled out with long unnecessary extracts from various works, (even one of several leaves from Osborne's Harleian Catalogue, and those not compiled by Johnson, but by Oldys,) a very small part of it relates to the person who is the subject of the book; and, in that, there is such an inaccuracy in the statement of facts, as in so solemn an authour is hardly excusable, and certainly makes his narrative very unsatisfactory. But what is still worse, there is throughout the whole of it a dark uncharitable cast, by which the most unfavourable construction is put upon almost every circumstance in the character and conduct of my illustrious friend; who, I trust, will, be a true and fair delineation, be vindicated both from the injurious misrepresentation of this authour, and from the slighter aspersions of a lady who once lived in great intimacy with him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nice {{began to}} attempt {{to build a new}} stadium in 2002. In its first attempt, the club was heavily criticised by local {{politicians}} who questioned the usefulness and format of the stadium. Despite the critics, however, the club's proposition passed and excavation of the site in the plain of Var, at Nice-Lingostière, was set to begin in July 2006. The Tribunal administratif of Nice cancelled the project for irregularities committed concerning the fixation of the price of tickets. In October 2008, the new deputy mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, declared <b>that</b> <b>Nice</b> would have a new stadium [...] "no later than 2013". The new stadium should be built at the same place as before, at Nice-Lingostière.|$|E
2500|$|The Indian tour {{proved to}} be the start of by far the most {{successful}} period of Hick's Test career.

In the first ODI of 1993 Hick made 85, but in the first Ashes Test at Old Trafford, he was famously sledged by Merv Hughes, leading umpire Dickie Bird to ask him: [...] "What has <b>that</b> <b>nice</b> Mr Hick ever done to you?" [...] Hughes later commented that although he had been [...] "a bit [...] with Hick"; he [...] "only sledged batsmen [...] respected".|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the claim of ageism made against the National Institute for Health & Clinical Excellence and like organisations, and to {{identify}} circumstances under which ageist discrimination might arise. We adopt a broad definition of ageism as representing any discrimination against individuals or groups of individuals solely on the basis that they have shorter life expectancy than others. A simple model of NICE?s decision making process is developed which demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>NICE?s</b> recommendations do not inherently discriminate on the basis of life expectancy per se but that scope for discrimination may arise in the case of specific technologies having identifiable characteristics. Such discrimination may favour patients with either longer or shorter life expectancy. It is shown <b>that</b> <b>NICE?s</b> policies, procedures and the context in which NICE makes its decisions not only reduce the scope for discriminatory recommendations but also – in the case of “end of life” treatments – increase the likelihood <b>that</b> <b>NICE?s</b> recommendations favour those with shorter, rather than longer, life expectancy. ...|$|R
2500|$|GameSpot's Greg Mueller {{scored the}} game 7.1 out of 10, calling it [...] "a basic action {{game with a}} heavy dose of button mashing {{and a little bit of}} task management." [...] Finding the combat repetitive, he argued, [...] "even with the rage moves the combat can get pretty dull after a while." [...] He was also {{critical}} of the graphics, writing [...] "detail is sometimes sacrificed to achieve <b>that</b> <b>nice</b> frame rate. The character models are blocky, and they don't animate particularly well. Additionally, all the textures are fuzzy and bland." [...] He concluded, [...] "Spartan: Total Warrior is a pretty fun, though derivative, action game that should keep you entertained for at least the six or seven hours it takes you to get through the story. With just a bit more effort, Spartan could have been great." ...|$|E

[...] MSNBC issued a statement saying that it had accepted Schultz's offer to take one week of unpaid leave over the matter. Schultz ended his radio show on May 23, 2014. He stated on MSNBC, [...] "This change will give me more flexibility to be on the road, to do the kind of shows I want to do here for The Ed Show here on MSNBC. This is on me, you know.
