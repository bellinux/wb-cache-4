The United States had pressured Pakistan for a military operation in North Waziristan for years, and the US Congress linked military assistance to Pakistan for the next fiscal year with military operations in North Waziristan in June 2014. Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said that the Pentagon was unaware of Pakistan's decision to launch a new offensive in North Waziristan: [...] "The Pakistan military and the government understand the threat, and they continue to go after that threat." [...] On 5 November 2014, Lt. Gen. Joseph Anderson, a senior commander for US and Nato forces in Afghanistan, said in a Pentagon-hosted video briefing from Afghanistan that the Haqqani network is now [...] "fractured" [...] like the Taliban. [...] "They are fractured. They are fractured like the <b>Taliban</b> <b>is.</b> That's based pretty much on the Pakistan's operations in North Waziristan this entire summer-fall," [...] he said, acknowledging the effectiveness of Pakistan's military offensive. [...] "That has very much disrupted their efforts in Afghanistan and has caused them to be less effective in terms of their ability to pull off an attack in Kabul," [...] Anderson added.|$|E

Although, they have been linked with Waziristan-based Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the connection between these two groups was of symbolic nature.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of the {{situation}} in Afghanistan since his visits in 2007, [...] "it's a very different war since I was here a year ago but the fighting with the <b>Taliban</b> <b>is</b> as intense as ever.

In fact, it's actually more dangerous now with the IED threat.". Kemp described how the Taliban had now apparently taken to engaging from a distance, and planting IEDs and mines in areas where troops are likely to take cover, such as in ditches, switching from conventional tactics to a greater use of booby traps and suicide bombers.|$|E

2500|$|The word <b>Taliban</b> <b>is</b> Pashto, [...] , meaning [...] "students", {{the plural}} of ṭālib.

Since becoming a loanword in English, Taliban, besides a plural noun referring to the group, has also been used as a singular noun referring to an individual. For example, John Walker Lindh has been referred to as [...] "an American Taliban", rather than [...] "an American Talib".

2500|$|On 17 February 2009, Barack Obama ordered 17,000 more US troops {{be sent to}} Afghanistan {{to bolster}} {{security}} {{in the country and}} thereby boosted the 36,000 US troops already there by 50%. [...] "This increase is necessary to stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, which has not received the strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires," [...] Obama said in a written statement. [...] "The <b>Taliban</b> <b>is</b> resurgent in Afghanistan, and Al-Qaeda supports the insurgency and threatens America from its safe haven along the Pakistani border," [...] Obama also said. He recognised [...] "the extraordinary strain this deployment places on our troops and military families", but the deteriorating security situation in the region required [...] "urgent attention and swift action". The new troop deployment was expected to include 8,000 U.S. Marines from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, [...] 4,000 U.S. Army troops from Fort Lewis, Washington and another 5,000 troops from an unspecified branch of the U.S. Armed Forces. Obama also said he was [...] "absolutely convinced that you cannot solve the problem of Afghanistan, the Taliban, the spread of extremism in that region solely through military means." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 2013 State of the Union Address, Obama {{said that}} the U.S. {{military}} will reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 US troops by February 2014. According to an unnamed U.S. official Obama made his decision [...] "based on {{the recommendations of the}} military and his national security team," [...] consultations with Karzai and [...] "international coalition partners." [...] The United States has adopted a withdrawal schedule which U.S. General John. R. Allen called a [...] "phased approach." [...] According to the new withdrawal schedule, as reported by the New York Times, the number of troops is to go down from 66,000 troops to 60,500 by the end of May 2013. By the end of November 2013, the number will be down to 52,000. By the end of February 2014, the troop level is to be around 32,000. The Washington Post reported a slightly different withdrawal plan which calls for the U.S. forces figure of 68,000 troops to drop to about 60,000 by May 2013 and 52,500 by November 2013. The largest exodus will occur in December 2013 and January 2014, when about 18,500 troops will leave Afghanistan. The White House intended to allow the military to determine the pace at which the 34,000 troops are withdrawn over the 12 months until February 2013. Top U.S. military [...] officers have said they hope to keep as many forces as possible in Afghanistan through summer 2013, when combat with the <b>Taliban</b> <b>is</b> usually at its highest. [...] "Commanders will have discretion on pace of this drawdown which will allow them to maintain the force they need through the fighting season," [...] according to one U.S. official. The drawdown announcement generated mixed reactions in Afghanistan: While Afghan officials like Karzai and the Taliban welcomed Obama's decision, many Afghans worried that a quick drawdown will destabilize the country. Afghans also expressed their concern that Afghan security forces were not ready to take the lead for security.|$|E
