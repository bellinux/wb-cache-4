5|$|Some lessons {{identified}} in the series include diversity, acceptance, political tolerance, and equality. Surveys of over 1,000 college students in the United States show that <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>read</b> the books were significantly different {{than those who had}} not. Readers of the series were found to be more tolerant, more opposed to violence and torture, less authoritarian, and less cynical. Although it is not known if this is a cause-and-effect relationship, there is a clear correlation, and it seems that Harry Potter's cultural impact may be stronger than just a fandom bond.|$|E

In one study, researchers had one group of participants list all factors that influenced their chances of experiencing a variety of events, and then a second group read the list. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>read</b> the list showed less optimistic bias in their own reports. It's possible that greater knowledge about others and their perceptions of their chances of risk bring the comparison group closer to the participant.|$|E

25|$|The Grand Excursion, a {{trip into}} the Upper Midwest {{sponsored}} by the Rock Island Railroad, brought {{more than a thousand}} curious travelers into the area by rail and steamboat in 1854. The next year, in 1855, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow published The Song of Hiawatha, an epic poem based on the Ojibwe legends of Hiawatha. A number of natural area landmarks were included in the story, such as Lake Minnetonka and Minnehaha Falls.

25|$|Brisbane's {{book was}} well-received and it enjoyed {{immediate}} success, gaining a broad readership among those {{concerned with the}} problems of society and helping to launch the Fourierist movement in the United States. Among <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>read</b> Brisbane's book and was thereby converted to the ideas of socialism was a young New York newspaper publisher, Horace Greeley, later elected to the US House of Representatives. Greeley would provide valuable service to the Fourierist movement by advancing its ideas in the pages of his newspaper of that day, The New Yorker, throughout 1840 and 1841, and offering Brisbane a column in his successor publication, the New York Tribune, from the time of its establishment in March 1842.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} is slightly more complex if electronic formatting {{is to be}} used. Where distribution is to be by CD-ROM or other physical media, {{there is no reason}} to treat this form differently from a paper format, and national copyright is an acceptable approach. But the possibility of Internet download without the ability to restrict physical distribution within national boundaries presents legal problems that are usually solved by selling language or translation rights rather than national rights. Thus, Internet access across the European Union is relatively open because of the laws forbidding discrimination based on nationality, but the fact of publication in, say, France, limits the target market to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>read</b> French.|$|E
25|$|The Court's {{opinions}} are published in three stages. First, a slip opinion is made {{available on the}} Court's web site and through other outlets. Next, several opinions and lists of the court's orders are bound together in paperback form, called a preliminary print of United States Reports, the official series of books in which {{the final version of}} the Court's opinions appears. About a year after the preliminary prints are issued, a final bound volume of U.S. Reports is issued. The individual volumes of U.S. Reports are numbered so that users may cite this set of reports—or a competing version published by another commercial legal publisher but containing parallel citations—to allow <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>read</b> their pleadings and other briefs to find the cases quickly and easily.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a longstanding}} {{tradition}} {{of reading the}} oracle in chapter 9 as a messianic prophecy–and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>read</b> the prophecy this way seldom follow historical-critical scholars in seeing the Book of Daniel as a combination of legendary folktales and other visionary episodes that belong to the literary genre of Jewish pseudepigrapha, but {{as a series of}} historical events that actually took place in the sixth century BCE and are faithfully recorded as such in the biblical text. On this understanding, the prophecy has more in common with the genre of Old Testament prophecy in developing the ancient Jewish/Christian eschatological hope of a future messianic age in which the promised Davidic king will preside over an era of worldwide peace, prosperity, and enduring righteousness. This way of reading the prophecy has given rise to a rich tradition of Christian theological speculation beginning with the early church fathers in which the prophecy is understood to be a prediction involving the coming of Christ in Jesus of Nazareth.|$|E

25|$|The best-known {{account of}} Wei Boyang {{is found in}} the Shenxian zhuan (Biographies of the Divine Immortals), a work {{attributed}} to Ge Hong (283-343). According to this record (trans. Campany, 2002:368-69), Wei Boyang {{was the son of a}} high-ranking family. He and three disciples retired to a mountain and compounded an elixir. When they tested it on a dog, the dog died. Despite this, Wei Boyang and one of his disciples decided to ingest the compound, and they also died. After the two other disciples had left, Wei Boyang came to life again. He poured some of the elixir into the mouths of the dead disciple and the dog, and they also revived. Thus Wei Boyang and his faithful disciple attained immortality. With an abrupt change in tone and language, the account ends with a final paragraph, which mentions Wei Boyang’s authorship of the Cantong qi and of another work entitled The Five Categories (Wu xianglei 五相類), criticizing at the same time <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>read</b> the Cantong qi as a work concerned with cosmology instead of alchemy.|$|E
500|$|Literary texts {{were often}} shared aloud at meals or with reading groups. Scholars such as Pliny the Elder engaged in [...] "multitasking" [...] by having works {{read aloud to}} them while they dined, bathed or travelled, times during which they might also dictate drafts or notes to their secretaries. The multivolume Attic Nights of Aulus Gellius is an {{extended}} exploration of how Romans constructed their literary culture. The reading public expanded from the 1st through the 3rd century, and while <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>read</b> for pleasure remained a minority, {{they were no longer}} confined to a sophisticated ruling elite, reflecting the social fluidity of the Empire as a whole and giving rise to [...] "consumer literature" [...] meant for entertainment.

500|$|Although earlier {{metrical}} homilies, such {{as those}} of Ælfric and Wulfstan, were based on the rules of Old English poetry, they took sufficient liberties with meter to be readable as prose. Orm does not follow their example. Rather, he adopts a [...] "jog-trot fifteener" [...] for his rhythm, based on the Latin iambic septenarius, and writes continuously, neither dividing his work into stanzas nor rhyming his lines, again following Latin poetry (Bennett 1986, p.31). The work is unusual in that no critic ever has stepped forward to defend it on literary grounds. Indeed, Orm was humble about his oeuvre: he admits in the preface that he frequently has padded the lines to fill out the meter, [...] "to help <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>read</b> it", and urges his brother Walter to edit the poetry to make it more meet (Treharne 2000, pp.274–75).|$|E

500|$|The first Sex Pistols gig {{to attract}} broader {{attention}} {{was as a}} supporting act for Eddie and the Hot Rods, a leading pub rock group, at the Marquee on 12 February 1976. Rotten [...] "was now really pushing the barriers of performance, walking off stage, sitting with the audience, throwing Jordan across the dance floor and chucking chairs around, before smashing some of Eddie and the Hot Rods' gear." [...] The band's first review appeared in the NME, accompanied by a brief interview in which Steve Jones declared, [...] "Actually we're not into music. We're into chaos." [...] Among <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>read</b> the article were two students at the Bolton Institute of Technology, Howard Devoto and Pete Shelley, who headed down to London {{in search of the}} Sex Pistols.

500|$|In her {{analysis}} of the fish, MacDonald asserts that it represents {{the voice of the}} children's absent mother. Its conflict with the Cat, not only over the Cat's uninvited presence but also their inherent predator-prey relationship, provides the tension of the story. She points out that on the last page, while the children are hesitant to tell their mother about what happened in her absence, the fish gives a knowing look to the readers to assure them [...] "that something did go on but that silence is the better part of valor in this case". Alison Lurie agrees, writing, [...] "there is a strong suggestion that they might not tell her." [...] She argues that, in the Cat's destruction of the house, [...] "the kidsand not only those in the story, but <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>read</b> ithave vicariously given full rein to their destructive impulses without guilt or consequences." [...] For a 1983 article, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, [...] "The Cat in the Hat is a revolt against authority, but it's ameliorated {{by the fact that the}} Cat cleans up everything at the end. It's revolutionary in that it goes as far as Kerensky and then stops. It doesn't go quite as far as Lenin." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Hubbard spoke {{openly about}} space opera in the 1950s, Scientology {{eventually}} became an esoteric faith: some teachings are withheld until followers reach {{a certain point}} in their spiritual development, and the mythological foundation of the courses are unknown to many members. Over a decade of auditing and study—and donations {{of tens of thousands of}} dollars—are required for a member to reach the highest echelons of hidden knowledge. Followers below a certain level (...) of growth are denied access to the church's cosmological teachings, and they are given different explanations for the church's teachings. German scholar Gerald Willms notes that in addition to the esoteric foundations, Scientology cites practical justifications for its rituals, so they can be pursued without knowledge of advanced teachings. The Church of Scientology has attempted to prevent the public release of their esoteric teachings, but, through the internet, their confidential aspects have been widely released. The church considers public discussion of their space opera teachings offensive and has asked academics not to publish their details. Scientologists maintain that the true meaning of these texts is only accessible to those who have progressed through their courses, and that <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>read</b> them prematurely risk damage to their spiritual and physical conditions. Church leaders have sometimes outright refused to discuss the subject with journalists. Rothstein observes that the church also has a strong financial motivation to keep members from accessing higher level courses, as devotees are required to make large payments to obtain them. Free Zone Scientologists, however, are sometimes more open about space opera. Some Free Zone Scientologists believe that the Church of Scientology has been hijacked by undercover agents of the Marcabian Confederacy.|$|E
