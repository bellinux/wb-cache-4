5|$|The {{second group}} {{was made up}} of the tribes from eastern Illinois Country, which {{included}} the Miami, Wea, Kickapoo, Mascouten, and Piankashaw. Like the Great Lakes tribes, <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> a long history of close trading and other relations with the French. Throughout the war, the British were unable to project military power into the Illinois Country, which was on the remote western edge of the conflict. The Illinois tribes were the last {{to come to terms with}} the British.|$|E
5|$|The {{third group}} {{was made up}} of tribes of the Ohio Country: Delawares (Lenape), Shawnee, Wyandot, and Mingo. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> {{migrated}} to the Ohio valley earlier in the century from the mid-Atlantic and other eastern areas in order to escape British, French, and Iroquois domination in the New York and Pennsylvania area. Unlike the Great Lakes and Illinois Country tribes, Ohio Native Americans had no great attachment to the French regime. They had fought as French allies in the previous war in an effort to drive away the British. They made a separate peace with the British with the understanding that the British Army would withdraw from the Ohio Country. But after the departure of the French, the British strengthened their forts in the region rather than abandoning them, and so the Ohioans went to war in 1763 in another attempt to drive out the British.|$|E

25|$|The Kingdom of Asturias was, in its infancy, an {{indigenous}} reaction of Astures and Cantabri {{to a foreign}} invasion. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> already fought the Romans in the Cantabrian Wars, and initially resisted Romanisation. Although they preserved many characteristics of their pre-Roman culture, their Celtic languages were later lost in favor of Latin.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{large numbers}} of East African Indians, {{predominantly}} Gujaratis but also sizeable numbers of Punjabis who already held British passports, entered the UK after they were expelled from Kenya, Uganda and Zanzibar.

25|$|PTSD became first evident due {{to those}} {{individuals}} who suffered extremely horrible experiences from war. Society noticed that those {{who took part in}} war, or had family members who took part in war, became distant from themselves and suffered terribly and found it very difficult to cope with the tragedies. Researchers took note of this and aimed to evaluate the situation and come to a conclusion with how to rehabilitate these victims, and while doing this they determined that <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th and 17th centuries, {{something}} {{known as}} the witch hunt took place across Europe and the American colonies, during which somewhere between 40,000 and 100,000 people were killed. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> {{been accused of being}} witches, who, according to their persecutors, worshipped the Devil, and committed acts of diabolism that included the cannibalism of children and desecration of the Eucharist. Most scholars since have agreed that these were the victims of isolated incidents of hysteria in remote, peasant communities, {{and that there was no}} religion being practised by these witches.|$|E

Even the flight of former Mercury astronaut and US Senator John Glenn was questioned. The concern was that <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> replaced career astronauts in very limited flight opportunities, and some may have flown without fully understanding the level of danger involved in a Shuttle mission.|$|E
25|$|The Tlahuica {{eventually}} became the dominant ethnic group in Morelos. They were organized into about fifty small city-states {{each with a}} hereditary ruler (tlatoani). Each Tlahuica city-state consisted of a central town, with its temple, plaza, palace and the surrounding countryside and villages. The largest of these were Cuernavaca and Huaxtepec (now spelled Oaxtepec). <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> advanced knowledge of astronomy and a highly developed agricultural system. They were especially known for growing cotton, which was planted wherever the land could be irrigated. Tlahuica women spun and wove cloth, which became an important item for exchange and for paying tribute.|$|E
25|$|Unable to help themselves, {{the king}} of Tanjore and Vangaru Tirumala called for the {{assistance}} of the Marathas of Satara. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> their own grievance against the Nawabs of Arcot, with whom Chanda Sahib still was identified, because of long-delayed payment of the chouth, or one-fourth of their revenues, which they had promised in return for the withdrawal of the Marathas from their country and the discontinuation of their incursions. They also were encouraged to attempt reprisals by the Nizam of Hyderabad, who – jealous of the increasing power of the Nawab and careless of the loyalty due to co-religionists – gladly would have seen his dangerous subordinate brought to the ground.|$|E

25|$|Sir Richard Temple {{was sent}} by the British India Government as Special Famine Commissioner to oversee the relief works of the Mysore {{government}}. To deal with the famine, the government of Mysore, started relief kitchens. A {{large number of people}} came into Bangalore, when relief was available. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> to work on the Bangalore-Mysore railway line in exchange for food and grains. The Mysore government imported large quantities of grain from the neighbouring British ruled Madras Presidency. Grazing in forests was allowed temporarily, and new tanks were constructed and old tanks repaired. The Dewan of Mysore State, C. V. Rungacharlu, in his Dasara speech estimated the cost to the state at 160 lakhs, with the state incurring a debt of 80 lakhs.|$|E
25|$|The new Belgian capital {{remained}} a mostly Dutch-speaking city, where the inhabitants spoke a local South Brabantian dialect. A minority of French-speaking citizens, mainly {{those who had}} immigrated from France during the previous decades, constituted 15% of the population. Despite this, the first mayor of Brussels after the revolution, Nicolas-Jean Rouppe, declared French to be the sole language of administration. The political center of Brussels attracted the economic elite, and Brussels soon acquired French-speaking upper and middle classes. In 1846, 38% of the city declared themselves being French-speaking, while this percentage was 5% in Ghent and 2% in Antwerp. Many supposed French-speakers were actually Flemish bourgeois with Dutch-speaking roots. In 1860, 95% of the Flemish population spoke Dutch, although <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> hardly any {{economic and political power}} and deemed a good knowledge of French necessary to attain higher social status and wealth.|$|E
25|$|Lienhard’s {{keen sense}} of {{observation}} {{was not limited to}} outward features, but involved his heart and mind as well. Although he respected the indigenous people from the start as the natives of the land, his early comments are not free from the typical ethnocentric views of the whites. Gradually his perspective changed, especially during his stay at Mimal on the Yuba River, where he lived for six months in isolation from white settlers and in close contact with the indigenous peoples of the surrounding villages. Some gathered regularly at his house, observed his activities with interest, traded, or occasionally helped with garden work. They taught him to become a first-rate archer, now and then took him along to their families, and nursed him back to health when he fell ill. Thus Lienhard began to observe their daily life and marveled at their skill in basketry, hunting and fishing. He often joined them in those pursuits and describes their methods of procuring and preparing food. His observations led him to understand that <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> organized their style of life in creative symbiosis with their surroundings, that their customs, though different, were ingenious, and that assessing them from a culturally biased vantage point did not do them justice. His growing understanding was extraordinary and increasingly run counter to the then dominant views. One night in the winter of 1848–49, he overheard his young Indian herdsmen talking of the times before the whites had invaded their valleys and of the ever worsening conditions. “The subdued talk of the Indians caused me to ponder,” he wrote. “In my thoughts I tried to put myself in the position of the Indians; and I wondered whether I would acquiesce if I were driven out of my and my ancestors’ homeland as had been the fate of the poor Indians. I confess that I was overwhelmed by strong feelings of revenge, always coming to the conclusion that I would take revenge on the shameless, greedy invaders in every possible way.” He knew from first-hand experience, however, that cooperation, escape, or resistance could all mean death for indigenous people.|$|E
