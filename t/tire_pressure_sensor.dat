40|$|Wireless {{networks}} are being {{integrated into the}} modern automobile. The security and privacy implications of such in-car networks, however, are not well understood as their transmissions propagate {{beyond the confines of}} a car’s body. To understand the risks associated with these wireless systems, this paper presents a privacy and secu-rity evaluation of wireless Tire Pressure Monitoring Sys-tems using both laboratory experiments with isolated <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> modules and experiments with a com-plete vehicle system. We show that eavesdropping is eas-ily possible at a distance of roughly 40 m from a passing vehicle. Further, reverse-engineering of the underlying protocols revealed static 32 bit identifiers and that mes-sages can be easily triggered remotely, which raises pri-vacy concerns as vehicles can be tracked through these identifiers. Further, current protocols do not employ authentication and vehicle implementations do not per-form basic input validation, thereby allowing for remote spoofing of sensor messages. We validated this experi-mentally by triggering tire pressure warning messages in a moving vehicle from a customized software radio at-tack platform located in a nearby vehicle.

40|$|An {{adaptive}} multi-element probabilistic collocation (ME-PC) {{method for}} quantifying uncertainties in electromagnetic compatibility and interference phenomena involving electrically large, multi-scale, and complex platforms is presented. The method permits the efficient and accurate statistical characterization of observables (i. e., quantities of interest such as coupled voltages) that potentially vary rapidly and/or are discontinuous in the random variables (i. e., parameters that characterize uncertainty in a system's geometry, configuration, or excitation). The method achieves its efficiency and accuracy by recursively and adaptively dividing {{the domain of}} the random variables into subdomains using as a guide the decay rate of relative error in a polynomial chaos expansion of the observables. While constructing local polynomial expansions on each subdomain, a fast integral-equation-based deterministic field-cable-circuit simulator is used to compute the observable values at the collocation/integration points determined by the adaptive ME-PC scheme. The adaptive ME-PC scheme requires far fewer (computationally costly) deterministic simulations than traditional polynomial chaos collocation and Monte Carlo methods for computing averages, standard deviations, and probability density functions of rapidly varying observables.

40|$|Ultra {{low power}} {{wireless}} sensors and sensor systems are of increasing {{interest in a}} variety of applications ranging from structural health monitoring to industrial process control. Electrochemical batteries have thus far remained the primary energy sources for such systems despite the finite associated lifetimes imposed due to limitations associated with energy density. However, certain applications (such as implantable biomedical electronic devices and <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sensors)</b> require the operation of sensors and sensor systems over significant periods of time, where battery usage may be impractical and add cost due to the requirement for periodic re-charging and/or replacement. In order to address this challenge and extend the operational lifetime of wireless sensors, there has been an emerging research interest on harvesting ambient vibration energy. Vibration energy harvesting is a technology that generates electrical energy from ambient kinetic energy. Despite numerous research publications in this field over the past decade, low power density and variable ambient conditions remain as the key limitations of vibration energy harvesting. In terms of the piezoelectric transducers, the open-circuit voltage is usually low, which limits its power while extracted by a full-bridge rectifier. In terms of the interface circuits, most reported circuits are limited by the power efficiency, suitability to real-world vibration conditions and system volume due to large off-chip components required. The research reported in this thesis is focused on increasing power output of piezoelectric transducers and power extraction efficiency of interface circuits. There are five main chapters describing two new design topologies of piezoelectric transducers and three novel active interface circuits implemented with CMOS technology. In order to improve the power output of a piezoelectric transducer, a series connection configuration scheme is proposed, which splits the electrode of a harvester into multiple equal regions connected in series to inherently increase the open-circuit voltage generated by the harvester. This topology passively increases the rectified power while using a full-bridge rectifier. While most of piezoelectric transducers are designed with piezoelectric layers fully covered by electrodes, this thesis proposes a new electrode design topology, which maximizes the raw AC output power of a piezoelectric harvester by finding an optimal electrode coverage. In order to extract power from a piezoelectric harvester, three active interface circuits are proposed in this thesis. The first one improves the conventional SSHI (synchronized switch harvesting on inductor) by employing a startup circuitry to enable the system to start operating under much lower vibration excitation levels. The second one dynamically configures the connection of the two regions of a piezoelectric transducer to increase the operational range and output power under a variety of excitation levels. The third one is a novel SSH architecture which employs capacitors instead of inductors to perform synchronous voltage flip. This new architecture is named as SSHC (synchronized switch harvesting on capacitors) to distinguish from SSHI rectifiers and indicate its inductorless architecture...|$|R

50|$|A {{much more}} active {{approach}} to monitoring <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> involves retrofitting a <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> monitor to your vehicle.

Tire rack, for example, offers aftermarket <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> monitors from various companies, including one that notifies {{the driver of the}} <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> in each wheel, as well as exactly which tire the system is displaying the pressure of. A much less expensive way to monitor <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> is to install valve stem caps that alert the driver to low <b>tire</b> <b>pressure.</b> These work by first setting the pressure on the cap matching the pressure you desire your tires to be at. Once installed on the tire's valve stem, the tip of these caps will change color (from green, to yellow, to red) when the tire becomes under-inflated. The benefit of this system is its low initial cost, but its disadvantages include questionable accuracy (even more so if the caps aren't tightened down enough) and {{that the only way to}} monitor them is from outside of the vehicle, looking directly at the cap. It's always a good idea to have a quality, reliable tire gauge on hand regardless of what system is installed in your vehicle, and to either check <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> yourself of by having someone else do it, as most <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> monitor systems will not alert the driver until the <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> falls below a certain amount, usually 20% below the recommended pressure.|$|R
