The objective {{of these tests}} was to compare the shaft capacities obtained from the field load tests with capacities predicted using analytical methods and with typi-cal presumptive design capacities. It was believed that the actual ca-pacities of the drilled shafts would be considerably greater than the capacities predicted from presumptive bearing capacity values. Based {{on the results of}} this testing, the following conclusions were drawn. Observed values of side resistance are comparable to the predicted val-ues obtained from empirical relationships. Observed values of <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> pressure greatly exceed the presumptive values of allowable bearing capacity commonly used for the design of shafts bearing on Burlington limestone. The test shafts were not failed in <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> and it is believed that the ultimate <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> pressures would signifi-cantly exceed the observed <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> pressures.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{vertical}} {{bearing capacity}} of a bucket foundation installed in sand can be calculated as sum of the skin friction and <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity. However, the current design equations are not considering the non-associated flow characteristics of sand and {{the reduction in the}} skin friction and increase in the <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity when the vertical load is applied. In this study, we perform two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element analyses following non-associated flow rule and calculate the vertical bearing capacity of circular bucket foundation of various sizes installed in sand of different friction angles. After calculating the skin friction and <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> force at the ultimate state, design equations are derived for each. The skin friction of bucket foundation is shown significantly small compared to the <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity. Considering the difference with the available design equation for piles, it is recommended that the equation for piles is used for the bucket foundation. A new shape-depth factor (sq･dq) for bucket foundation is recommended which also accounts for the increment of the <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity due to skin friction.

For example, mobilizing an excavator versus a pile driving rig provided substantial logistical and driving advantages. When soil conditions differ adding pile length proves to be an easy task.

40|$|AbstractOn {{the basis}} of the {{mechanism}} of tapered piles and evidence obtained from small scale model tests, this paper proposes cylindrical and spherical cavity expansion theories to evaluate the skin friction by introducing a stress–dilatancy relationship, as well as the <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of tapered piles by introducing a tapering factor. In general, in order to evaluate the skin friction, either the angle of internal friction or dilatancy angle is assumed to be constant. This research improves on this drawback and considers both properties to calculate the skin friction through an iterative process in the load transfer method. At the mean time, the effect of angle of tapering is introduced to evaluate the <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of tapered piles. The test results and proposed models show that a slight increase in the tapering angle of the pile results in higher skin friction and affects the <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> resistance compared with conventional straight piles on different types of sands at different relative densities. The proposed models are then applied to different types of prototype and real type pile tests in order to evaluate the predicted skin friction, expected <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity and vertical bearing capacity...|$|R

Therefore, the tribological behaviour of the conrod big <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> is often one of the key elements to engine reliability, and it has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally in several contributions in the pertinent literature [1]. With the ever-increasing quest to improve engine performance, and the consequent increase of the rotational speed and combustion/inertial loads, the cavitation of the lubricant used in conrod big <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> may play a crucial role in the assessment of bearing durability. To overcome problems related to film cavitation, palliatives such as the reduction of the clearance between the components, the increase of the oil supply pressure and/or the use of harder coating materials have been commonly adopted. However, such simple adjustments do not always represent a valid solution; further investigations are required in order to avoid cavitation damage occurrence. The cavitation damage has been studied for more than a century both theoretically [2 - 5] and experimentally [6, 7], and many attempts have been made to predict or measure the pressure spikes developing in the cavitated areas due to bubble collapse. Although a universally accepted theory seems not to exist, it is clear that the cavitation damage occurs due to the rapid and violent collapse of the vapour bubbles in the proximity of a solid boundary.

The bearings and builded bearing models considered in this work {{are based on a}} Volvo 13 L engine. Two main models to predict the oil flow in main {{and connecting}} rod bearings have been investigated using the system analysis software GT-SUITE. These two models are based on two numerical methods called  the Mobility method and the Reynold's equation respectively. The main bearing and the connecting rod large <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> loads calculated in the present work is similar to the reference bearing loads, especially for connecting rod large <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> and at lower engine speeds. For higher engine speeds, the present load results are far off,  compared to the reference load results. This difference at the higher engine speeds showed also an increased difference in the oil volume flow rates. But more information regarding the calculations of the reference loads is needed to analyze the differences further. Considering the "split lines", where the upper and the lower bearing shell meet, in the bearing models increased the oil volume flow rate with 13. 3 % on average for the main bearing. Main bearing stand for 86 % of the total flow whilst connecting rod large end and small <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> stand for the rest 13 % and 1 % of the total flow.

Comparing to the numerical reference flow results, the results in this work are similar at high oil temperatures and at low engine speeds, otherwise the results are far off. Considering the Reynold's equation when predicting the oil volume flow rates in plain journal bearings is a more accurate way than using the Mobility method since it takes more specific geometrical irregularities into account. The oil volume flow rate for main bearing differ with 2. 7 % on average when solving the Reynold's equation compared to the Mobility method...|$|R
