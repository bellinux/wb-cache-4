5|$|Unlike diethyl ether, {{methoxyflurane}} is {{a significant}} respiratory depressant. In dogs, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in respiratory rate and a marked decrease in respiratory minute volume, with a relatively mild decrease in <b>tidal</b> <b>volume.</b> In humans, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in <b>tidal</b> <b>volume</b> and minute volume, with respiratory rate relatively constant. The net effect of these changes is profound respiratory depression, as evidenced by CO2 retention with a concomitant decrease in arterial pH (this {{is referred to as}} a respiratory acidosis) when anesthetized subjects are allowed to breathe spontaneously for any length of time.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs when}} the opening that allows air to enter the pleural space functions as a one-way valve, allowing more air to enter with every breath but none to escape.

Unless corrected, hypoxia (decreased oxygen levels) and respiratory arrest eventually follow.|$|E
5|$|Lung {{function}} {{testing is}} carried out by evaluating a person's capacity to inhale and exhale in different circumstances.

40|$|Two {{randomized}} controlled trials confirmed {{the existence of}} so-called ventilator-associated lung injury by showing reduced morbidity and mortality {{with the use of}} lower <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). While guidelines now strongly advise using lower <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> in ALI/ARDS patients, at present there are no widely agreed upon guidelines for setting <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> in patients who do not suffer from ALI/ARDS. The literature was searched for clinical studies on lung-protective mechanical ventilation using lower <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> in patients not suffering from ALI/ARDS. The best available evidence comes from large retrospective or observational studies which suggest a causal relation between the use of large <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> and the development of lung injury. The inconsistent results from smaller {{randomized controlled}} trials, however, do not definitely support the use of lower <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes.</b> The association with potentially injurious ventilator settings, in particular large <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes,</b> suggests that additional lung injury in mechanically ventilated patients without ALI/ARDS is, in part, a preventable complication.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Alveolar fibrin {{deposition}} is {{a hallmark}} of acute lung injury, resulting from activation of coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis. Previous {{studies have shown that}} mechanical ventilation with high <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> may aggravate lung injury in patients with sepsis and acute lung injury. The authors sought {{to determine the effects of}} mechanical ventilation on the alveolar hemostatic balance in patients without preexistent lung injury. METHODS: Patients scheduled for an elective surgical procedure (lasting > or = 5 h) were randomly assigned to mechanical ventilation with either higher <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> of 12 ml/kg ideal body weight and no positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or lower <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> of 6 ml/kg and 10 cm H 2 O PEEP. After induction of anesthesia and 5 h later bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood samples were obtained, and markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis were measured. RESULTS: In contrast to mechanical ventilation with lower <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> and PEEP (n = 21), the use of higher <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> without PEEP (n = 19) caused activation of bronchoalveolar coagulation, as reflected by a marked increase in thrombin-antithrombin complexes, soluble tissue factor, and factor VIIa after 5 h of mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation with higher <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> without PEEP caused an increase in soluble thrombomodulin in lavage fluids and lower levels of bronchoalveolar activated protein C in comparison with lower <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> and PEEP. Bronchoalveolar fibrinolytic activity did not change by either ventilation strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical ventilation with higher <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> and no PEEP promotes procoagulant changes, which are largely prevented by the use of lower <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> and PEE...|$|R

25|$|Within each {{ventilatory}} pattern {{there are}} several variations that can be distinguished by their targeting scheme(s). A targeting scheme is a description of how the ventilator achieves preset targets. A target is a predetermined goal of ventilator output. Examples of within-breath targets include inspiratory flow or pressure and rise time (set-point targeting), <b>tidal</b> <b>volume</b> (dual targeting) and constant of proportionality between inspiratory pressure and patient effort (servo targeting). Examples of between-breath targets and targeting schemes include average <b>tidal</b> <b>volume</b> (for adaptive targeting), percent minute ventilation (for optimal targeting) and combined PCO2, volume, and frequency values describing a “zone of comfort” (for intelligent targeting, e.g., SmartCarePS or IntelliVent-ASV). The targeting scheme (or combination of targeting schemes) is what distinguishes one ventilatory pattern from another. There are 7 basic targeting schemes that comprise the wide variety seen in different modes of ventilation: Set-point: A targeting scheme for which the operator sets all {{the parameters of the}} pressure waveform (pressure control modes) or volume and flow waveforms (volume control modes).Dual: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to switch between volume control and pressure control during a single inspiration.Bio-variable: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set the inspiratory pressure or <b>tidal</b> <b>volume</b> randomly to mimic the variability observed during normal breathing.Servo: A targeting scheme for which inspiratory pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort.Adaptive: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set one target (eg, pressure within a breath) to achieve another target (eg, average <b>tidal</b> <b>volume</b> over several breaths).Optimal: A targeting scheme that automatically adjusts the targets of the ventilatory pattern to either minimize or maximize some overall performance characteristic (eg, minimize the work rate done by the ventilatory pattern).Intelligent: A targeting scheme that uses artificial intelligence programs such as fuzzy logic, rule based expert systems, and artificial neural networks.|$|E
25|$|Pressure {{support is}} a {{spontaneous}} mode of ventilation also named Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV).

30|$|The Pexa {{technique}} {{has not been}} used in mechanical ventilation before, {{and we wanted to}} try to achieve a situation that would most likely demonstrate a difference in particle flow between different ventilation modes and <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes.</b> We assumed that with having a low PEEP as a basic setting, we could facilitate the detection of the largest change between small and large <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> in particle flow. It is, however, generally more preferable to use a higher PEEP (e.g., five PEEP) in clinical practice. In vivo, we found that VCV resulted in a significantly lower particle flow than PCV; we also found that large <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> resulted in a larger particle flow than small <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes.</b> Increasing PEEP from 2 to 10 did not result in any significant increase or decrease in particle flow in the in vivo ventilation; however, after we went from 10 PEEP to 2 PEEP, we observed an increase in particle flow from the airways. The overall observation was that the particle flow was higher in all PCV settings using small or large <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes,</b> high or low PEEP. The difference in particle flow between the different ventilation modes and between small and large <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> might be suggested to be caused by an increased opening and closing of small lung segments during PCV and during large <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes.</b>|$|R

25|$|Isolated {{mechanical}} forces may not adequately explain ventilator induced lung injury (VILI).

40|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} has {{the potential}} to cause lung injury, and the role of complement activation herein is uncertain. We hypothesized that inhibition of the complement cascade by administration of plasma-derived human C 1 -esterase inhibitor (C 1 -INH) prevents ventilation-induced pulmonary complement activation, and as such attenuates lung inflammation and lung injury in a rat model of Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia. Forty hours after intratracheal challenge with S. pneumoniae causing pneumonia rats were subjected to ventilation with lower <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or high <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> without PEEP, after an intravenous bolus of C 1 -INH (200 U/kg) or placebo (saline). After 4 h of ventilation blood, broncho-alveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue were collected. Non-ventilated rats with S. pneumoniae pneumonia served as controls. While ventilation with lower <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> and PEEP slightly amplified pneumonia-induced complement activation in the lungs, ventilation with higher <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> without PEEP augmented local complement activation more strongly. Systemic pre-treatment with C 1 -INH, however, failed to alter ventilation-induced complement activation with both ventilation strategies. In accordance, lung inflammation and lung injury were not affected by pre-treatment with C 1 -INH, neither in rats ventilated with lower <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> and PEEP, nor rats ventilated with high <b>tidal</b> <b>volumes</b> without PEEP.

25|$|On this basis, Apatosaurus {{could not}} have had a reptilian {{respiratory}} system, as its <b>tidal</b> <b>volume</b> would have been less than its dead-space volume, so that stale air was not expelled but was sucked back into the lungs. Likewise, a mammalian system would only provide to the lungs about 225−184=41liters of fresh, oxygenated air on each breath. Apatosaurus must therefore have had either a system unknown {{in the modern world}} or one like birds', with multiple air sacs and a flow-through lung. Furthermore, an avian system would only need a lung volume of about 600liters while a mammalian one would have required about 2,950liters, which would exceed the estimated 1,700liters of space available in a 30-ton Apatosaurus′ chest.|$|E
25|$|Barotrauma is a {{recognised}} {{complication of}} mechanical ventilation {{that can occur}} in any patient receiving mechanical ventilation, but is most commonly associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. It {{used to be the}} most common complication of mechanical ventilation but can usually be avoided by limiting <b>tidal</b> <b>volume</b> and plateau pressure to less than 30 to 50cm water column (30 to 50mb). As an indicator of transalveolar pressure, which predicts alveolar distention, plateau pressure or peak airway pressure (PAP) may be the most effective predictor of risk, but there is no generally accepted safe pressure at which there is no risk. Risk also appears to be increased by aspiration of stomach contents and pre-existing disease such as necrotising pneumonia and chronic lung disease. Status asthmaticus is a particular problem as it requires relatively high pressures to overcome bronchial obstruction.|$|E
25|$|The {{volume of}} air that moves {{in or out}} (at the nose or mouth) during a single {{breathing}} cycle is called the <b>tidal</b> <b>volume.</b> In a resting adult human it is about 500ml per breath. At the end of exhalation the airways contain about 150ml of alveolar air {{which is the first}} air that is breathed back into the alveoli during inhalation. This volume air that is breathed out of the alveoli and back in again is known as dead space ventilation, which has the consequence that of the 500ml breathed into the alveoli with each breath only 350ml (500ml - 150ml = 350ml) is fresh warm and moistened air. Since this 350ml of fresh air is thoroughly mixed and diluted by the air that remains in the alveoli after normal exhalation (i.e. the functional residual capacity of about 2.5–3.0liters), {{it is clear that the}} composition of the alveolar air changes very little during the breathing cycle (see Fig. 9). The oxygen tension (or partial pressure) remains close to 13-14kPa (about 100mmHg), and that of carbon dioxide very close to 5.3kPa (or 40mmHg). This contrasts with composition of the dry outside air at sea level, where the partial pressure of oxygen is 21kPa (or 160mmHg) and that of carbon dioxide 0.04kPa (or 0.3mmHg).|$|E
