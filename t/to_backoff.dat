We find that the representative AQM, random early detection (RED), fails to maintain a stable backlog under time-varying wireless losses. We find that the key to resolving the problem is to robustly track the backlog to a preset reference level, and apply the control-theoretic vehicle, internal model principle, to realize such tracking.

30|$|The Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) is a {{compulsory}} and default MAC protocol in WLANs. DCF is {{a carrier}} sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme. Fragmentation is an optional DCF enhancement feature {{that can be}} enabled by specifying a fragmentation threshold (IEEE 802.11 - 2007 2007). When the size of a MAC service data unit (MSDU) arriving from the network layer is larger than that of the fragmentation threshold it will be split into fragments, MAC protocol data units (MPDU). The fragments belonging to the same frame are transmitted in a burst until all are sent or an ACK is not received. In either case the STA exits the burst and contends for the channel in accordance to CSMA/CA to send the next frame in the queue or retransmit a failed fragment respectively. In this paper, we refer to this as classical fragmentation (CF) scheme. Its operation is summarized in Algorithm 1. Despite its advantages, CF adds some overheads because it duplicates frame headers in every fragment and extra ACK for every successful fragment. Since an STA has to contend for channel whenever a fragment is to be retransmitted, further overheads are incurred due <b>to</b> <b>backoffs.</b>|$|R

Experimental {{results have}} shown significant divergence from simulation results {{due to the}} effect of signal fading in realistic wireless communication channels. In this paper, we characterize the impact of fading on protocol performance. We first study the effect of fading on MAC performance and show that its effect can be dominating. One of our important conclusions is that eliminating RTS/CTS packets results in more effective operation under fading. We also identify an unfairness problem that arises due <b>to</b> <b>backoffs</b> in the presence of fading. Moreover, fading results in several subtle interactions between the MAC and routing layers. We identify several of these problems and make observations about effective approaches for addressing them. For example, the criteria for determining the best path should not only consider the link status but also the link order. In addition, because routing protocols rely on MAC level transmission failure (when the retry limit is exceeded), route failure errors are often generated unnecessarily. Finally, because MAC level broadcasts are unreliable, they are especially vulnerable to fading. We analyze these effects and outline preliminary solutions to them. Comment: 12 pages; 14 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Delivering sensory data to {{the sink}} {{reliably}} in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) calls for a scalable, energy-efficient, and error-resilient routing solution. In this paper, a Spatial-Temporal relation-based Energy-Efficient Reliable (STEER) routing protocol is proposed to achieve the above goals for WSNs. As opposed to the next-hop-selection-first, data-relay-next approach, which is typical in traditional routing protocols in WSNs, STEER reverses these two steps. In unreliable communication environments, traditional sensor routing protocols may fail to deliver data {{in a timely manner}} since a link/node failure can be found out only after multiple unsuccessful retransmissions in the MAC layer, which then sends a failure notification back to the network layer for selecting an alternate next hop. In STEER, each data packet is relayed by broadcasting, and, among the neighbors (closer to the sink) that receive the data, one next-hop node will be elected. In so doing, eligibility as a next hop is evaluated by temporal gradient, which is similar <b>to</b> <b>backoff</b> for channel access in IEEE 802. 11 systems.
