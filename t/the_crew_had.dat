5|$|Filming {{began in}} Marrakech, Morocco, on May 4, 1998, and lasted {{seventeen}} weeks; <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> to endure dehydration, sandstorms, and snakes while filming in the Sahara. The visual effects {{were provided by}} Industrial Light & Magic, who blended film and computer-generated imagery to create the titular Mummy. Jerry Goldsmith provided the orchestral score.|$|E
5|$|On 13 July U-255 {{found the}} 7,168 ton Dutch {{merchant}} ship Paulus Potter abandoned and drifting, with 2,250 tons of general goods, ammunition, 34 tanks, 15 aircraft and 103 trucks aboard. The ship {{had been attacked}} by Ju 88 dive bombers of III./KG 30 east-north-east of Bear Island on 5 July, the day after Convoy PQ 17 dispersed. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> abandoned the badly damaged ship, believing {{it was about to}} sink. All 76 of <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> taken five days to reach land at Novaya Zemlya, eventually being rescued by a Soviet whaling vessel. After finding her the II.WO and two mates from U-255 boarded the ship, and attempted to start the engines, but the engine room was flooded. They then searched the vessel, taking blankets, cigarettes, and other useful materials, including confidential documents found on the bridge, and the ship's ensign as a prize, before the ship was sunk with a single torpedo. U-255 returned to Narvik on 15 July.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} March 21, 2011, lasted 82 days, {{and had an}} estimated $120–130 million budget. Filming began at Shepperton Studios and Pinewood Studios in England. Scott used eight sound stages for filming, including the 007 Stage. Studio space was limited and <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> to make five stages work for approximately 16 sets, and increased {{the size of the}} 007 stage by over 30%.|$|E
5|$|The TSB {{concluded}} {{that even if}} <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> {{been aware of the}} nature of the problem immediately after detection of the initial odor, and had commenced an approach as rapidly as possible, the developing fire-related conditions in the cockpit would have made a safe landing at Halifax impossible.|$|E

5|$|The ship's crew {{comprised}} 50 {{officers and}} 656 ratings in 1863. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> to do physically demanding tasks; one such duty was {{the raising of}} the heaviest manually hauled anchors in maritime history. The day-to-day life of her crew differed little from those on the navy's traditional wooden-hulled vessels.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{more substantial}} repairs over the winter, De Soto sailed to Venezuela on 3 March 1868, {{to secure the}} release of crewmen from the whaling schooner Hannah Grant, who had been captured on the peninsula of Paraguano. At Curaçao, Capt. Boggs learned that <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> already been released, but he remained in Venezuelan waters {{in support of the}} American minister during interviews with the Venezuelan vice-president and other officials of the Republic.|$|E
5|$|Glatter has praised MacLachlan's {{involvement}} in his role, believing that he fully embraced and explored {{the character of}} Cooper; she noted that he was as devoted to the character's comedic elements as to his dramatic side and that <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> difficulty completing takes featuring Cooper without laughing at his comic delivery. She has also noted that although the writers and directors on the series tended to emphasize the rapport between Cooper and Fenn's character Audrey Horne, {{there was never any}} intention to bring the characters together as a couple.|$|E

5|$|On 12 August 1978, Vulcan B.2 XL390 of No. 617 Squadron crashed {{during an}} air display at Naval Air Station Glenview, Illinois in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> been {{authorised}} {{to carry out}} a display at Chicago Lakeside airport, the captain had elected {{to carry out a}}n unauthorised display at Glenview beforehand. After a low-level run, probably below , the aircraft pulled up for an improperly executed wingover, resulting in a low-level stall and crash, killing all on board.|$|E
5|$|On Christmas Day, the Expedition 1 {{crew were}} given the day off work. They opened {{presents}} delivered by Endeavour and the Progress supply ship. They also each took turns speaking to their families. In the following days they did several video downlinks, some with Russian TV stations. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> a quiet New Year. Citing a Naval tradition, for the New Year's entry of the station's log, Shepherd provided a poem {{on behalf of the}} crew.|$|E
5|$|Researchers have {{identified}} {{factors contributing to}} the relatively rapid fall of the fortress. It had not been completely renovated; its defenders were inexperienced; <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> been frequently rotated, and {{had not been able}} to familiarize themselves with the surrounding area and with the fortress. Although most of their experience lay in the defense of the fortress' interior, they were dispatched to fight on open ground. When the combat moved outside the fortress, communication lines were disrupted by the German bombardment, and the fortress defense was unable to restore complete communication with the command center or with other forts. The absence of external support was a crucial factor in its fall.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to tractor-trailers, <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>has</b> overhauled pickup trucks and various specialty trucks such as dump trucks and {{an ice cream}} truck.|$|R

5|$|Schmid {{declined}} {{a contract}} offer from Columbus after the 2008 season and became coach of Seattle Sounders FC. The Crew's ownership believed that Schmid {{had been in}} contact with Sounders FC despite being denied permission to talk to other teams during the season. It was also alleged that he shared confidential information with Seattle after his contract with <b>the</b> <b>Crew</b> <b>had</b> ended. The MLS ruled that no tampering had occurred, but ordered Sounders FC to financially compensate the Crew.|$|E
5|$|Steiner was {{not present}} during the bombing, but at a command bunker in Franceville-Plage. After the raid, he {{set out for the}} battery, but was unable to gain entry due to the volume of fire from the British paratroopers. At the same time, a {{reconnaissance}} patrol from an army Flak unit with a half-track mounting a large anti-aircraft gun arrived. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> intended to seek cover at the position, but instead used the gun to engage the paratroopers.|$|E
5|$|The {{gasoline}} {{fires that}} flared up around Turret 1 {{might have caused}} more critical damage if the main magazines had not been empty. For several days prior to the attack, all of the 14-inch-gun (356mm) battleships had been replacing their standard-weight main battery projectiles with a new heavier projectile that offered greater penetration and a larger explosive charge {{in exchange for a}} slight decrease in range. All of the older projectiles and powder charges had been removed from the magazines of Nevada, and <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> taken a break after loading the new projectiles in anticipation of loading the new powder charges on Sunday.|$|E

5|$|The launch, which {{occurred}} in pre-dawn darkness, {{was the first}} American night launch since Apollo 17, and was watched by several thousand spectators. The unusual launching time was due to tracking requirements for the primary payload, INSAT-1B; the program would not have another night launch until STS-61-B in 1985. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> attempted to prepare for it by training in darkened simulators so as to keep their night vision, but in practice {{it was discovered that}} the light of the solid-fuel rocket boosters made the immediate area around the launchpad virtually as bright as a day launch.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} the crew faced was the cold; in the morning, the {{temperatures}} peaked at around −22°F, while by mid-afternoon it often dropped to −50°. The stuntmen, dressed in woolen costumes, {{were in danger}} of catching pneumonia. Ice caverns producer Jaffe had scouted partially melted before filming; with only two-and-a-third days of time to film, <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> to do the best they could. Batteries drained after minutes of filming in the cold, and the lack of snow was compensated by dropping fake precipitation into the scene by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinking of}} Vengeur du Peuple {{was used as}} {{propaganda}} by the National Convention and Bertrand Barère, who {{gave birth to the}} legend that <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> gone down with the ship fighting, rather than surrender. The Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle repeated the tale in his , yielding a rebuttal by Rear-Admiral John Griffiths, who had witnessed the events. Although discredited in naval history circles, the legend lived on as a folk tale, inspiring numerous representations and a fictional account by Jules Verne in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea.|$|E
