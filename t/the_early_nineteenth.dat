5|$|Following the First Seminole War and {{a treaty}} with Spain, Florida became a U.S. {{territory}} in 1821. Under pressure from US settlers, Seminole and Black Seminoles began to migrate into {{central and southern}} Florida. In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, African-American slaves and Black Seminoles escaped to the Bahamas from Cape Florida, including hundreds in the 1820s, to evade American slavers.|$|E
5|$|Largely {{concerned}} with gender issues, Midas {{comments on the}} definitions of femininity and masculinity in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century and the developing ideology of separate spheres which encouraged women to restrict themselves to domestic affairs and men to political affairs.

5|$|Romanticism in Scotland was an artistic, {{literary}} and intellectual movement that developed between {{the late eighteenth}} and <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> centuries.

5|$|At {{least partly}} {{explaining}} why both Lamb and Hazlitt felt {{the inadequacy of}} Shakespearean stage performances was that the theatres themselves were huge and gaudy, audiences were noisy and unmannerly, and dramatic presentations in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century were sensationalistic, laden with artificial and showy props.

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, Neoclassical {{architectural}} elements {{began to}} appear in the federal style row homes, such as iconic columns in the porticoes and classic motifs over doorways and windows.

Greek and Roman elements were integrated into public buildings such as the old City Hall, the old Norfolk Academy, and the Customs House.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction is {{generally}} by allogamy (cross-pollination) and Hippeastrum may be propagated by seed or offset bulbils (bulblets), although commercial ventures use in vitro techniques, or splitting of the bulb into sections.

5000|$|As {{happened}} under <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>Nineteenth</b> Dynasty, this dynasty struggled {{under the}} effects of the bickering between the heirs of Ramesses III. For instance, three different sons of Ramesses III are known to have assumed power as Ramesses IV, Ramesses VI and Ramesses VIII respectively. However, at this time Egypt was also increasingly beset by a series of droughts, below-normal flooding levels of the Nile, famine, civil unrest and official corruption [...] - [...] all of which would limit the managerial abilities of any king.|$|R
5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in Western Europe, {{in the nineteenth}} century there was a return to Medieval styles, grouped together into a Gothic revival. Early examples included Adams' St George's Episcopal Chapel in Edinburgh (1792), which included octagonal lantern on ogival arches. Other examples included James Playfair's chapel-like Farnell Church (c. 1789) and Richard Crichton's towered Craig Parish Church (1799). In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century examples influenced by the English Perpendicular included Glenorchy Church (1810–11), built by the Earl of Breadalbane, John Paterson's octagonal reconstruction of St Paul's Church, Perth (c. 1800–07) and Fetteresso Church, Stonehaven (1810–12). Examples of a more explicitly perpendicular form can be seen in Gillespie Graham's Collace (1813), or David Hamilton's Old Erskine (1813–14).|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} both South African and South American plants {{were placed in}} this same genus. By <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century Amaryllis had become a {{polymorphic}} (diverse) genus with about 50 species from what we would consider a dozen genera today, and {{attempts were made to}} separate it into different genera. This work commenced in 1819 with the contributions of the English botanist, the Revd. William Herbert in Curtis's Botanical Magazine which he expanded in 1821 in The Botanical Register, identifying 14 species of the new genus of Hippeastrum, and only leaving three species in Amaryllis. The rest of the Amaryllis species he transferred to other genera, several of which he created. Herbert further refined his descriptions of Hippeastrum in his work on the Amaryllidaceae in 1837.|$|E
5|$|Buckland had not {{provided}} a specific name, as {{was not uncommon}} in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, when the genus was still seen as the more essential concept. In 1826, Ferdinand von Ritgen gave this dinosaur a complete binomial, Megalosaurus conybeari, which however was not much used by later authors and is now considered a nomen oblitum. A year later, in 1827, Gideon Mantell included Megalosaurus in his geological survey of southeastern England, and assigned the species its current valid binomial name, Megalosaurus bucklandii. Until recently, the form Megalosaurus bucklandi was often used, a variant first published in 1832 by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer – and sometimes erroneously ascribed to von Ritgen – but the more original M. bucklandii has priority.|$|E

5|$|Cooley {{maintained}} friendly {{relations and}} {{trade with the}} Seminole Indians in the area. In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, Creek Indians had moved from Alabama and joined the Seminoles. In 1835, white settlers killed Creek chief Alibama and burned his hut in a dispute. As Justice of the Peace, Cooley jailed the settlers, but they were released due to insufficient evidence after a hearing at the Monroe County Court in Key West. The Creek people blamed Cooley, saying he withheld evidence. The growing uneasiness between the Creeks and the whites led to the Creeks' emigration to the Okeechobee area.|$|E
5|$|In most {{theories}} up to {{the eighteenth}} century, light was pictured as being made up of particles. Since particle models cannot easily account for the refraction, diffraction and birefringence of light, wave theories of light were proposed by René Descartes (1637), Robert Hooke (1665), and Christiaan Huygens (1678); however, particle models remained dominant, chiefly due {{to the influence of}} Isaac Newton. In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, Thomas Young and August Fresnel clearly demonstrated the interference and diffraction of light and by 1850 wave models were generally accepted. In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell's prediction that light was an electromagnetic wave—which was confirmed experimentally in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz's detection of radio waves—seemed to be the final blow to particle models of light.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> {{century the}} kelp {{industry}} provided significant employment {{on some of}} the Orkney islands, but when the market collapsed between 1830 and 1832 it caused considerable hardship. North Ronaldsay was especially hard-hit and several families were allowed to resettle from there to develop land at Westside on Eday. Rising populations meant increasing land values, especially for small tenancies. In 1843 crofts were valued at £1/acre on Eday, nearly three times the price for larger farms. However, the 20th century saw decline. Immigration from mainland Scotland was essentially unknown even in the late 1950s and the population in 2001 was about an eighth of the total 160 years earlier.|$|E

After Taylor's death in 1815, his son Charles, newly married to Mary Hoyt, moved the family west to Ohio. Several other Sherman relatives soon followed, and Charles became established as a lawyer in Lancaster. By the time of John Sherman's birth, Charles had just been appointed a justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{religion of}} the Māori population was animistic, but {{with the arrival of}} missionaries from <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century most of the Māori population converted to Christianity. In the 2013 census, 2,595 Māori still identify themselves as adhering to traditional Māori beliefs. The largest Christian denominations are Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Presbyterianism. There are also significant numbers of Christians who identify themselves with Methodist, Pentecostal, Baptist and Latter-day Saint churches, and the New Zealand-based Rātana church has adherents among Māori. Immigration and associated demographic change in recent decades has contributed to the growth of minority religions, especially Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam.|$|E
5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century Tunbridge Wells {{experienced}} {{growth as}} {{a place for the}} well-to-do to visit and make their homes. It became a fashionable resort town again following visits by the Duchess of Kent, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and benefited from a new estate on Mount Pleasant and the building of the Trinity church in 1827, and improvements made to the town and the provision of facilities such as gas lighting and a police service meant that by 1837 the town population had swelled to 9,100. In 1842 an omnibus service was set up that ran from Tonbridge to Tunbridge Wells, enabling visitors to arrive from London within two hours, and in 1845 the town was linked to the railway network via a branch from South Eastern Railway's London-Hastings Hastings Line at Tonbridge. During this time Decimus Burton developed John Ward's Calverley Park estate.|$|E
