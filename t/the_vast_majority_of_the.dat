5|$|While many {{bacteria}} and mitochondria have polyadenylate polymerases, {{they also have}} another type of polyadenylation, performed by polynucleotide phosphorylase itself.

It can synthesise a 3' extension where <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bases are adenines.

5|$|A {{cluster is}} a group of loosely coupled {{computers}} that work together closely, so that in some respects they can be regarded as a single computer.

The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet local area network.

5|$|Because {{uranium-235}} {{was known}} to be fissionable, it was the first material pursued in the approach to bomb development.

The first shipments of highly enriched uranium were sent to the Los Alamos Laboratory in June 1944.|$|E

5|$|For {{manual welding}} methods, labor costs {{generally}} make up <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total cost.

To do this, welding procedures with high deposition rates can be selected, and weld parameters can be fine-tuned to increase welding speed. Mechanization and automation are often implemented to reduce labor costs, but this frequently increases the cost of equipment and creates additional setup time. Material costs tend to increase when special properties are necessary, and energy costs normally do not amount to more than several {{percent of the total}} welding cost.|$|E
