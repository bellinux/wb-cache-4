5|$|A Sm3 derailed near Karjaa on 25 July 2003 due to {{a defect}} in a <b>turnout.</b> The train derailed at a low speed after {{mechanics}} turned the <b>turnout</b> blades manually into the correct position, but forgot to check the <b>turnout</b> frog, which was set to a diverging track. The first three carriages of the train derailed completely, {{in addition to the}} first bogie of the fourth car.|$|E
5|$|The average <b>turnout</b> at the {{referendum}} was 43.51%. The figure includes the voters living abroad, whose <b>turnout</b> was only 3.51%; they comprise more than 9% {{of the total}} Croatian electorate. The highest turnouts were recorded {{in the city of}} Zagreb and in Varaždin County, at 55.13% and 53.66% respectively, while the lowest <b>turnout</b> in Croatia was recorded in Lika-Senj County at just 34.52%. There is no <b>turnout</b> threshold for a referendum to be legally valid.|$|E
5|$|Current Electoral College rules tend to {{decrease}} voter <b>turnout</b> in states without close races. Voters living outside the swing {{states have a}} greater certainty of which candidate is likely to win their state. This knowledge of the probable outcome decreases their incentive to vote. A report by the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate found that 2004 voter <b>turnout</b> in competitive swing states grew by 6.3% from the previous presidential election, compared to an increase of only 3.8% in noncompetitive states. A report by The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) found that <b>turnout</b> among eligible voters under age 30 was 64.4% in the 10 closest battleground states and only 47.6% {{in the rest of}} the country—a 17% gap.|$|E
50|$|Old <b>turnouts</b> {{may need}} {{replacement}} to allow trains {{to run through}} the <b>turnouts</b> at higher speeds. In the United States, some old <b>turnouts</b> have speed limit of 20 mph. Even with newer <b>turnouts</b> (rated #20), the diverging speed limit is still at 45 mph which would significantly slow down the higher-speed train passing through those sections. High-speed <b>turnouts</b> (rated #32.7) are capable of handling maximum diverging speeds of 80 mph.|$|R
50|$|Generally higher <b>turnouts,</b> {{although}} several wartime elections exhibited the lowest recorded <b>turnouts.</b>|$|R
25|$|An {{improved}} junction {{replaces the}} diamond with <b>turnouts,</b> {{which can be}} of as fine an angle as possible, so that this junction can carry branch traffic at high speed. This configuration assumes power operation of the points, as high speed <b>turnouts</b> are generally not suitable for mechanical operation. The high speed <b>turnouts</b> may require more than one point machine each. The <b>turnouts</b> can have no superelevation while the curve in the branch can; therefore the radius in the <b>turnouts</b> must be greater than the radius of the curve in the branch.|$|R
5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} on December 4, 2004, Boustany defeated Mount, 55 percent to 45 percent in an election with low voter <b>turnout.</b> Democrats had hoped on a big <b>turnout,</b> as the district is nearly a quarter African American, a reliable Democratic constituency. Analysis of the race suggested that Mount's defeat was helped by the open primary system that had the Democratic candidates work against each other and led to Cravin's conflict with the state Democratic Party which in turn led to suppressed voter <b>turnout.</b> The large number of negative advertisements was also cited as a factor that contributed to low <b>turnout.</b> Another detriment for Mount mentioned was the strong support for George W. Bush {{in the presidential election}} against John Kerry in the district, which he carried by about 60 percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{directly}} elected {{every five years}} by universal suffrage since 1979. However, voter <b>turnout</b> at European Parliament elections has fallen consecutively at each election since that date, and has been under 50% since 1999. Voter <b>turnout</b> in 2014 stood at 42.54% of all European voters.|$|E
5|$|The low <b>turnout</b> was {{attributed}} {{in part to}} poor voter registry maintenance. The registry allegedly contains up to 900,000 nonexistent voters due to poor database maintenance, especially in updating the registry using death certificates and change of residence records. This allegation {{was supported by the}} 2011 census. The poor voter records were subsequently cited as the cause of the low formal <b>turnout,</b> which would otherwise have exceeded 50%. It was later estimated that the actual <b>turnout</b> in Croatia itself, without the diaspora, was 61%.|$|E

5|$|Elections {{are governed}} by the State Electoral Commission and electoral boards. Members of those bodies are {{required}} to have a university degree in law, {{and they may not}} be members of any political party. The State Electoral Commission prepares and manages elections in accordance with legislation, appoints lower-ranking election-commission and board members, issues directives to such bodies and supervises their work. The State Electoral Commission compiles and publishes candidate lists, supervises the legality of political campaigns and compiles and publishes election results. All members of election boards (or their legal deputies) must be present at assigned polling stations at all times while the polling station is open. The board verifies the identity of voters against the list of registered voters and records the <b>turnout.</b> The <b>turnout</b> number is later checked against number of votes cast; if the number of votes exceeds the <b>turnout,</b> the election at that polling station must be repeated. Votes are tallied by hand, and that information is forwarded (along with all other records kept at the polling station) to the State Electoral Commission.|$|E
5|$|From 2010 to 2015, the MP for Eastbourne was the Liberal Democrat Stephen Lloyd, {{who beat}} Waterson with a 3.8% swing on a <b>turnout</b> of 67% in the 2010 General Election.|$|E
50|$|Older <b>turnouts</b> use {{the same}} rail section, shaved down, for both stock rail and switch blade. Newer {{tangential}} <b>turnouts</b> use a stubbier rail section for the switch blade.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} history of {{railways}} in Britain, when signalling and interlockings were primitive, and staff were inexperienced, facing <b>turnouts</b> were a hazard, because they could switch a train travelling at high speed into a slow speed divergence or dead end. Facing <b>turnouts</b> were therefore banned, except when absolutely necessary. Facing <b>turnouts</b> cannot be avoided on single lines and their crossing loops.|$|R
50|$|Because of dangers {{imposed by}} wild {{animals such as}} lions, manual control of loops <b>turnouts</b> is not {{necessarily}} a good idea, and some degree of automation of these <b>turnouts,</b> and fencing, is desirable.|$|R
5|$|In Maine, 20 {{counties}} were declared {{states of}} emergency. After the storm, Southern New England Telephone sent {{a crew of}} 100workers in 50trucks to Maine to assist in restoring power. Power was quickly restored, and in some places the outages were less severe than during Carol. For only {{the third time in}} its history, the Portland Evening Express was not delivered due to the storm. Most primary roads were re-opened by two days after the storm, although rural areas and rail lines took longer to repair. There was a temporary travel ban for all but emergency vehicles in Maine due to washed out roads. Affecting densely populated portions of the state, Edna struck the day before the governor race between Republican Burton M. Cross and Democratic Edmund Muskie. Before the election, politicians commented how a suppressed <b>turnout</b> {{as a result of the}} storm would benefit Muskie, in a state where no Democrat had won governorship since 1934. Muskie ultimately won the election in a close race, which saw a lower <b>turnout</b> than 1950, likely due to Edna suppressing the rural, Republican <b>turnout.</b>|$|E

In the 2009 gubernatorial election, Democrat Jon Corzine received 9,347 ballots cast (71.8% vs. 48.0% countywide), ahead of Republican Chris Christie with 3,242 votes (24.9% vs. 45.8%), Independent Chris Daggett with 343 votes (2.6% vs. 4.7%) and other candidates with 41 votes (0.3% vs. 0.5%), among the 13,027 ballots cast by the township's 25,513 registered voters, yielding a 51.1% <b>turnout</b> (vs. 50.0% in the county).|$|E
50|$|The speed {{restriction}} {{in one direction}} can be eliminated with higher-speed <b>turnouts,</b> but this may require power operation, as the longer and heavier high-speed <b>turnouts</b> may be beyond the capability of manual lever operation.|$|R
50|$|One way of {{avoiding}} complicated and weak dual gauge <b>turnouts,</b> provided there is room, is {{to separate the}} gauges and then design the yard with single gauge <b>turnouts</b> and dual gauge diamond crossings. Gauge splitters assume that trains have a single gauge. Gauge splitters may be fixed, meaning they have no moving parts and are intended for low speed use, or they be power operated like ordinary <b>turnouts.</b>|$|R

The Progressive Conservative membership also approved the agreement {{by a margin of}} 95% to 5%. With a <b>turnout</b> of 55% of eligible members, 25,692 PC members voted yes and 1,344 voted no with 24 spoiled ballots; the party's constitution required a simple majority of its membership to approve the merger.|$|E
