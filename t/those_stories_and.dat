5|$|Tolkien's works show much {{influence}} from Norse mythology, reflecting his lifelong passion for <b>those</b> <b>stories</b> <b>and</b> his academic interest in Germanic philology. The Hobbit {{is no exception}} to this; the work shows influences from northern European literature, myths and languages, especially from the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda. Examples include the names of characters, such as Fili, Kili, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Dori, Nori, Dwalin, Balin, Dain, Nain, Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf (deriving from the Old Norse names Fíli, Kíli, Oin, Glói, Bivör, Bávörr, Bömburr, Dori, Nóri, Dvalinn, Bláin, Dain, Nain, Þorin Eikinskialdi and Gandálfr). But while their names are from Old Norse, the characters of the dwarves are more directly taken from fairy tales such as Snow White and Snow-White and Rose-Red as collected by the Brothers Grimm. The latter tale may also have influenced the character of Beorn.|$|E
500|$|The longest-running {{series of}} books to feature Nancy Drew is the {{original}} Nancy Drew series, whose 175 volumes were published from 1930 to 2003. Nancy also appeared in 124 titles in The Nancy Drew Files and is currently the heroine of the Diaries series. Various other series feature the character, such as the Nancy Drew Notebooks and Nancy Drew on Campus. While Nancy Drew is the central character in each series, continuity is preserved only within one series, not between them all; for example, in concurrently published titles in the Nancy Drew series and the Nancy Drew on Campus series, Nancy is respectively dating her boyfriend Ned Nickerson or broken up with Ned Nickerson. [...] The two exceptions are the A Nancy Drew And Hardy Boys SuperMystery series that ran concurrently with the Files, and shares continuity with <b>those</b> <b>stories</b> <b>and</b> the then-running [...] Hardy Boys Casefiles, and in 2007 a new A Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys Super Mystery series shared continuity with both the Girl Detective series.|$|E

While {{reviewing}} Speak Now, Dave Heaton of Pop Matters observed that the album is built upon conflicting stories which result in a discrepancy between <b>those</b> <b>stories</b> <b>and</b> the way life turns out. He added that [...] "'Story of Us' makes this explicit, by presenting the verses as 'chapters', within a song where the story isn’t being written the way [...] wants it to, turning into a 'tragedy' she didn’t imagine." [...] Liz Stinson of Paste was not impressed with the song and she likened Swift as the [...] "annoying cousin" [...] of Katy Perry for trying to embrace her pop side. Nevertheless, she felt that [...] "Swift is strongest when she lets her country roots shine through." [...] Theon Weber of The Village Voice chastised the song as [...] "giddy and bombastic (...) which plays around with glammy dance-pop." [...] Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country praised the song by claiming that it's [...] "upbeat and fun, and even a bit rock-y". Rahul Prabhakar of The Oxonian Review {{felt that it was}} [...] "fast-paced and destined for girls’ gym mixes, but otherwise boring."
