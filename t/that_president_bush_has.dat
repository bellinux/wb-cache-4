5000|$|Sykes begins {{her special}} {{by talking about}} sources of frustration, {{beginning}} with bad ideas for TV shows and ending with airport security. Talking about airports segues into a discussion of President Bush and 9/11 culminating in Sykes’ observation <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> done everything she expected him to do. She says, “The economy is in the toilet, we’re at war and everything is on fire." [...] Sykes continues with her critical tone firing off a barrage of jokes {{at the expense of}} the American government, the state of New Jersey, and the stock market. Keeping with the theme of current events, Sykes references the scandal surrounding the Catholic Church and makes observations about the Pope. She then shifts the object of her comedy to the topic of drinking, exploring the pros and cons of drinking in different cities, the dynamics between drunken friends and drunk driving. Next, Sykes uses the matter of strip clubs as a precursor to describing some of the differences between the ways in which men and women think and communicate. This leads to a conversation about marriage, which Sykes compares to a relationship between business partners of which children are the resulting product. She shares her opinions on having children, which she admits is not something she sees herself doing, and then moves on to contemplate the aging process. The last topic that Sykes tackles is sex, finishing her performance by revealing her thoughts on why women fake pleasure.|$|E
40|$|American {{presidents have}} {{maintained}} an equilibrium between {{the role of}} church and state in government affairs via the nation’s civil religion and a “rhetorical contract” between those secular and sacred interests. While other presidents have incorporated religion in their rhetorical execution of office, George W. Bush has done so in a manner different from his predecessors, emphasizing the role of faith in his administration’s beliefs, actions, and policies. Such rhetoric upsets the tenuous relationship between sectarian and secular affairs. Bush’s breach of the rhetorical contract can be explained by Foucault’s notion of pastoral power. Using practices once associated with the church, the savvy government leader may better control his public. I argue <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> shifted the balance of power between organized religion and government, specifically by means of the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, thereby corrupting traditional notions of civil religion in the process of implementing his unique form of new pastoral power...|$|E
40|$|Executive Summary Civil rights {{problems}} remain {{entrenched in}} American society, the stubborn result of unequal treatment over time. Discrimination in housing, employment, and the voting booth, unequal educational opportunity, {{and other problems}} still stand between some Americans and true equality. Presidential leadership is necessary to break down obstacles and realize the promise of civil rights. The U. S. Commission on Civil Rights (Commission) examined the George W. Bush administration’s commitment to that end. What follows are {{the results of the}} Commission’s examination, expressed in terms of: (1) whether civil rights enforcement is a presidential priority; (2) federal efforts to eradicate entrenched discrimination; (3) expanding and protecting rights for disadvantaged groups; and (4) promoting access to federal programs and services for traditionally underserved populations. This report finds <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> neither exhibited leadership on pressing civil rights issues, nor taken actions that matched his words. The report reaches this conclusion after analyzing and summarizing numerous documents, including historical literature, reports, scholarly articles, presidential and administration statements, executive orders, policy briefs, documents of Cabinet-level agencies, federal budgets and other data...|$|E

40|$|R) {{talks to}} the media after a meeting with {{administration}} officials at the White House in Washington. he White House Office is so large and complex that systematic process of policy evaluation is essential {{in order to provide}} the president with a range of options on all important policy decisions. Some of the most important decisions <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> made have been taken without the benefit of broad deliberation within the White House or Cabinet. This paper will take up four cases of policy decisions to illustrate the lack of a regular policy process and consultation that characterized many important decisions of the Bush administration. Two focus on detainee policy: the military commissions order of Nov. 13, 2001 and the Feb. 7, 2002 decision to suspend the Geneva Conventions. And two are about the war in Iraq: the initial decision to go to war, and the decision to disband the Iraqi army. The pattern that emerges from an examination of these four decisions is one of secrecy, top-down control, tightly held information, disregard for the judgments of career professionals, and the exclusion from deliberation of qualified executive branch experts who might have disagreed with those who initially framed the decisions...|$|E

50|$|From {{a report}} by the {{inspectors}} general of six US intelligence agencies that was declassified in September 2015, it became clear <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> originally authorized the collection of telephone and e-mail metadata only if one end of the communications was foreign or when there was a link to terrorism. But in 2004, the Justice Department found out that the NSA was apparently also collecting the metadata of purely domestic communications, after which <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> declared <b>that</b> NSA <b>had</b> always been allowed to do so, but that analysts were only allowed to look at metadata related to terrorism.

An ABC news poll found little difference in the percentage of Americans who felt that <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> made his case for war after he had made his speech, with the percentage remaining at about 40%.|$|R

That trio, in my view, abetted al Qaeda, and if the September 11 families were smart they would focus on the dereliction of Dick Clarke, Bill Clinton and Sandy Berger and not the antics of convicted September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui.|$|R

5000|$|Reform of {{the laws}} {{regarding}} illegal immigration to the United States operated as a wedge issue in 2007. Some Republican legislators, {{with the backing of}} <b>President</b> George W. <b>Bush,</b> sought to address the dual issues of ongoing illegal immigration to the United States and the illegal status of an estimated 12 million people currently living in America. Other Republicans bitterly opposed any [...] "amnesty" [...] for illegal immigrants, out of fear that their constituents were unsupportive of immigration reform. Some Democrats pitched in to keep the issue alive as they recognized the issue was deeply dividing the Republican party between advocates of reform and advocates of the status quo. The result was a bitter division in Republican ranks and a stalled bill in Congress; columnist Peggy Noonan wrote in January 2008 <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> [...] "destroyed the Republican Party, by which I mean he sundered it, broke its constituent pieces apart and set them against each other", by pushing immigration reform, as well as other wedge issues for the Republicans.|$|R

5000|$|When the Vision was {{announced}} in January 2004, the U.S. Congress and the scientific community gave it a mix {{of positive and negative}} reviews. For example, Rep.

Park stated that robotic spacecraft [...] "are doing so well it's {{going to be hard to}} justify sending a human," [...] the vision announced by the <b>President</b> states <b>that</b> [...] "robotic missions will serve as trailblazers — the advanced guard to the unknown." [...] Others, such as the Mars Society, have argued that it makes more sense to avoid going back to the Moon and instead focus on going to Mars first.Throughout much of 2004, it was unclear whether the U.S. Congress would be willing to approve and fund the Vision for Space Exploration. However, in November 2004, Congress passed a spending bill which gave NASA the $16.2 billion <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> sought to kick-start the Vision. According to then-NASA chief Sean O'Keefe, that spending bill “was as strong an endorsement of the space exploration vision, as any of us could have imagined.” In 2005, Congress passed S.1281, the NASA Authorization Act of 2005, which explicitly endorses the Vision.|$|R
