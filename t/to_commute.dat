5|$|Between the 1940s and the 1970s, {{the city}} saw {{significant}} growth in suburban areas from population migration. Veterans were returning from military service {{in large numbers}} seeking industrial and manufacturing jobs, {{a part of the}} local industry that was expanding rapidly. Advancements in architecture also contributed to the suburban boom. New, modernized shopping centers and the Interstate Highway System allowed workers <b>to</b> <b>commute</b> greater distances and families to live further from the downtown area. More than 127,000 homes were built in Montgomery County during the 1950s.|$|E
40|$|Commuting {{accidents}} {{issue has}} become a serious concern among safety and health’s employees in Malaysia. Many agencies have been collaborated together in finding {{the root cause of}} this problem. The study examines the factors that lead <b>to</b> <b>commuting</b> accidents. A convenient sample of 103 questionnaires was distributed to 103 respondents of staffs at PPK Technology Sdn Bhd in order to find the factors that lead <b>to</b> <b>commuting</b> accidents. According <b>to</b> previous cases, <b>commuting</b> accidents keep increasing in Malaysia year by year compared to industrial accidents that is decreasing. So that, responsible agencies should play their roles and responsibilities in order to cope with this problem. The awareness from the employees themselves is vital to resolve this problem. According to this research, the main contributing factor that leads <b>to</b> <b>commuting</b> accidents is road condition. As a conclusion, this study has been conducted in order to reveal a real cause that lead <b>to</b> <b>commuting</b> accidents...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the uproar}} over the poll tax {{as a factor}} in jury selection, the tax {{remained}} in Virginia until the ratification of the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution outlawed it in 1964. Pauli Murray was deeply affected by her experience working on the case and was inspired to pursue her career in civil rights law. Governor Darden, influenced by the popular sentiment that the case had evoked, began a reform of the Virginia penal system, including the creation of an official Pardon and Parole Board with the authority <b>to</b> <b>commute</b> sentences.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{earliest}} garden suburbs in the world, Noel Park was designed to provide affordable housing for working-class families wishing to leave the inner city; every property had both a front and back garden. It was planned from the outset as a self-contained community {{close enough to the}} rail network to allow its residents <b>to</b> <b>commute</b> to work. In line with the principles of the Artizans Company's founder, William Austin, no public houses were built within the estate, and there are still none today.|$|E

The governor serves for a four-year term, and may not serve more than two consecutive terms.|$|E

As Playford had not shown an inclination <b>to</b> <b>commute</b> Stuart's sentence, Dunstan introduced a bill to abolish capital punishment. The vote was split along party lines and was thus defeated, but Dunstan used the opportunity to attack the Playmander with much effect in the media, portraying the failed legislation as an unjust triumph of a malapportioned minority who had a vengeance mentality over an electorally repressed majority who wanted a humane outcome.|$|E

Fearing he would lose the votes of Southern congressional delegations for his legislative agenda, however, Franklin refused to publicly support the bill, which proved unable to pass the Senate. In 1942, Eleanor worked with activist Pauli Murray to persuade Franklin to appeal on behalf of sharecropper Odell Waller, convicted of killing a white farmer during a fight; though Franklin {{sent a letter to}} Virginia Governor Colgate Darden urging him <b>to</b> <b>commute</b> the sentence to life imprisonment, Waller was executed as scheduled.|$|E

5|$|Riel's {{execution}} and Macdonald's refusal <b>to</b> <b>commute</b> his sentence caused lasting discord in Quebec, {{and led to}} a fundamental alteration in the Canadian political order. In Quebec, Honoré Mercier exploited the discontent to reconstitute the Parti National. This party, which promoted Quebec nationalism, won a majority in the 1886 Quebec election by winning a number of seats formerly controlled by the Quebec Conservative Party. The federal election of 1887 likewise saw significant gains by the federal Liberals, again {{at the expense of the}} Conservatives. This led to the victory of the Liberal party under Sir Wilfrid Laurier in the federal election of 1896, which in turn set the stage for the domination of Canadian federal politics by the Liberal party in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Lloyd George, {{as well as}} future Prime Minister Winston Churchill were in {{attendance}} for the match. The press billed the match as England versus Wales, and noted that the Welsh fans included high numbers of woman as well as mothers with babies. There were special trains laid on for the Cardiff fans, which began arriving at Paddington train station from 4am onwards. The Metropolitan Railway put on additional trains <b>to</b> <b>commute</b> fans from Baker Street station to Wembley Park; one every two minutes. Between 11am to kick off, 30,000 fans per hour travelled this route; some 100,000 fans were expected {{to arrive at the}} ground. The Welsh fans made special excursions across London; some travelled to St. Paul's Cathedral, where they sang Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau. Other fans went to The Cenotaph, Whitehall, where they dressed it in Welsh colours to honour the veterans of the First World War.|$|E
5|$|The Frank {{case has}} been the subject of several media adaptations. In 1921, African-American {{director}} Oscar Micheaux directed a silent race film entitled The Gunsaulus Mystery, followed by Murder in Harlem in 1935. In 1937, Mervyn LeRoy directed They Won't Forget, based on the Ward Greene novel Death in The Deep South, which was in turn inspired by the Frank case. An episode of the 1964 TV series Profiles in Courage dramatized Governor John M. Slaton's decision <b>to</b> <b>commute</b> Frank's sentence. The episode starred Walter Matthau as Governor Slaton and Michael Constantine as Tom Watson. The 1988 TV miniseries The Murder of Mary Phagan was broadcast on NBC, starring Jack Lemmon as Gov. John Slaton and also featuring Kevin Spacey. The 1998 Broadway musical Parade, based on the case, won two Tony Awards. In 2009, Ben Loeterman directed the documentary film The People v.

5|$|With the WDL, Murray became {{active in}} the case of Odell Waller, a black Virginia {{sharecropper}} sentenced to death for killing his white landlord, Oscar Davis, during an argument. The WDL argued that Davis had cheated Waller in a settlement and as their argument grew more heated, Waller had shot Davis in legitimate fear of his life. Murray toured the country raising funds for Waller's appeal. She wrote to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt on Waller's behalf. Roosevelt in turn wrote to Virginia Governor James Hubert Price, asking him to guarantee that the trial was fair; she later persuaded the president to privately request Price <b>to</b> <b>commute</b> the death sentence. Through this correspondence, Murray and Eleanor Roosevelt began a friendship that would last until the latter's death two decades later. Despite the efforts of the WDL and the Roosevelts, however, the governor did not commute Waller's sentence. Waller was executed on July 2, 1942.|$|E
