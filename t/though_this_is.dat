5|$|A direct {{relativistic}} effect {{is that as}} atomic numbers of elements increase, the innermost electrons begin to revolve faster around the nucleus {{as a result of}} the increase of the electromagnetic attraction between an electron and a nucleus. Similar effects have been found for s orbitals (and p1/2 ones, <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not quite applicable for dubnium): for example, the 7s orbital is contracted by 25% in size and stabilized by 2.6 eV.|$|E

5|$|A mosaic {{mutation}} {{may or may}} not be inheritable, {{depending on}} the cell populations affected. <b>Though</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not always the case, genetic mutations can occur spontaneously in one sex cell of a parent during gametogenesis. In these cases, called germline mutations, the mutation will be present in the single-celled zygote conceived from the affected sperm or egg cell, and the condition can be inherited by the next generation.|$|E
5|$|According to surveys, the {{addition}} to a prescribed SSRI is a common strategy when people {{do not respond to}} the SSRI, even <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not an officially approved indication.

5|$|Even {{though it}} was {{subordinate}} to Vale Royal Abbey, the church at Llanbadarn Fawr remained important in its own right.

5|$|Many sources {{state the}} meaning of Rhondda as 'noisy', <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a {{simplified}} translation without research. Sir Ifor Williams, in his work Enwau Lleoedd, suggests that the first syllable rhwadd {{is a form of}} the Welsh adrawdd or adrodd, as in 'recite, relate, recount', similar to the Old Irish rád; 'speech'. The suggestion is that the river is speaking aloud, a comparison to the English expression 'a babbling brook'.|$|E
5|$|Once in Remalna-city, Mel {{finds herself}} popular {{in part because}} of her now legendary {{rebellion}} against the unpopular King Galdran. She acquires many male admirers, and is friendly but dismissive towards their romantic attentions. Mel avoids Shevraeth when possible, though when she often unexpectedly encounters him, Mel fights to remain cordial while he remains inscrutable but polite. Meanwhile, Galdran's sister, the Marquise of Merindar, attempts to manipulate Mel into distracting Shevraeth from her covert plans to take the throne for herself, <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> largely unsuccessful.|$|E
