Four {{officers}} from the Brooklyn North police precinct received a tip that a drug deal {{was about to take}} place. Two policemen, Gary Roteman and Arthur Cesare, stayed outside, while the third, Paul Halley, {{stood in front of the}} apartment building. Serpico climbed up <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>escape,</b> entered by <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>escape</b> door, went downstairs, listened for the password, then followed two suspects outside.|$|E

5000|$|Most of the {{purpose-built}} tenements in New York {{were not}} slums, {{although they were}} not pleasant to be inside, especially in hot weather, so people congregated outside, made heavy use of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>escapes,</b> and slept in summer on <b>fire</b> <b>escapes,</b> roofs, and sidewalks.|$|R

25|$|In {{the event}} of a fire, One Canada Square is not fully evacuated. The floor that has the fire and all other floors above are evacuated. The air {{conditioning}} is set to work in reverse to extract smoke and fresh air is blown into <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>escape</b> staircases to increase air pressure and therefore slow the entry of smoke into these areas. The sprinkler system will not operate unless there is sufficient heat acting on any sprinkler head (which are independent of each other and do not operate in unison).|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Gaga slowly {{appearing}} {{from behind a}} building on a deserted street corner. The whole scenario is bathed in red and violet lights, coming from {{the windows of the}} buildings and alleyways as steam billows out from the drains. When the first verse of the song begins, Gaga emerges from the window of an apartment onto <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>escape.</b> A long take follows, of Gaga strutting through the red-lit district singing the line [...] "I got a reason that you should take me home tonight", and a shock of black hair falls in her eyes. Gaga does not remove it and the shot spans to her walking backside, gesturing the viewer to follow. The video consists mostly of interchanging shots of Gaga dancing and singing on the street, on <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>escape,</b> and on the steps in front of the apartment building with Clemons. Near the end of the video, after Clemons' saxophone solo, Gaga crouches in front of the building's steps and kisses the sidewalk. The video concludes with a close-up of Gaga's face, before she re-enters through the window into her smokey apartment.|$|E

My tracers ripped into the shining plateglass of the penthouses on its top, and I saw the broken windows cascade like snow to the streets, many floors below. I laughed, for I knew that behind those windows were Japanese high officers, enjoying that modern hotel. When I got closer I could see uniformed figures going down <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>escapes,</b> and I shot at them...I turned {{for one more}} run on <b>the</b> packed <b>fire</b> <b>escapes</b> filled with Jap soldiers, but my next burst ended very suddenly.

500|$|Beiderbecke often {{failed to}} return to his {{dormitory}} before curfew, and sometimes stayed off-campus the next day. In {{the early morning hours of}} May 20, he was caught on <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>escape</b> to his dormitory, attempting to climb back into his room. The faculty voted to expel him the next day, due both to his academic failings and his extracurricular activities, which included drinking. The headmaster informed Beiderbecke's parents by letter that following his expulsion school officials confirmed that Beiderbecke [...] "was drinking himself and was responsible, in part at least, in having liquor brought into the School." [...] Soon after, Beiderbecke began pursuing a career in music.|$|E
500|$|Markley and Lloyd {{did not get}} on, {{which led}} to the latter leaving the group and Morgan joining full-time. According to Lloyd, Markley became {{increasingly}} overbearing on the WCPAEB's creative output, and [...] "he started to believe that he was like, you know, the real deal, as opposed to the guy who doesn't sing and doesn't really have any musical thoughts and stuff like that. He wasn't content anymore just being the guy who ended up with the girls that he could get from it". Lloyd remained in Los Angeles and participated in a number of studio projects with Fowley and Mike Curb such as October Country, the Smoke, St. John Green, and <b>the</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>Escape.</b>|$|E
500|$|The police {{investigate}} {{a string of}} murders committed by the Creeper (Rondo Hatton), a mysterious killer with a hideously disfigured face. The Creeper attacks and murders Professor Cushman (John Hamilton), a professor from the nearby Hampton University. Later that night, the killer approaches a woman named Joan Bemis (Janelle Johnson) {{in front of her}} home and identifies himself as Hal Moffet. Joan screams hysterically at the sight of him until he is driven to kill her. When police cars approach, the Creeper climbs <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>escape</b> of a city tenement building to escape and enters the apartment of Helen Paige (Jane Adams), a blind pianist. Unable to see the Creeper's deformed face, Helen is not afraid of the intruder, even when he admits to fleeing. [...] When police officers knock on her door, failing to identify themselves, Helen encourages him to hide in her bedroom, where he escapes through the window.|$|E

500|$|A {{renovation}} {{plan was}} finally announced in April 2015. The work began on 18 April 2016. It {{was to be}} done in three phases: the first phase was the renovation of the tunnel, the second phase the addition of a lift to Gornji Grad surface, and the third phase adding cultural facilities to attract tourists. A sum of 1,350,000 kuna (...) was allocated for the first phase. The renovation phase was completed on 6 July and the Grič Tunnel was officially opened to the public. Only the Mesnička Street entrance, Art Park exit and Tomić Street exit were opened at the time; Radić Street and Ilica 28 and 30 entrances remained closed. The execution of the renovation was criticised for not following safety precautions; the tunnel was said to be damp and to lack smoke detectors, fire doors, sprinklers, or a mechanical ventilation system, and <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>escape</b> route was problematic because two exits were narrowed to allow space for toilets.|$|E
500|$|In March and April 2011, several news {{agencies}} {{reported that}} the Mile-High Tower design had been approved at that height and that the building would cost almost US$30 billion (SR112.5 billion). This design {{was going to be}} drastically larger than the current design, with a floor area of [...] and would have utilized futuristic wind aversion and energy producing technology for sustainability. It and the surrounding City would have had the ability to accommodate 80,000 residents and one million visitors, according to RIA Novosti. Many things were rumored about the mile-high designs, such as that it would be so high the top would freeze at night, helicopters would be used for construction, parachutes would be part of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>escape</b> plan, and that an elevator ride to the top would take 12 minutes (multiple transfers would be required) in a typical elevator and five minutes in a high-speed elevator. Adrian Smith denied that he was a part of any of the earlier designs, which had been purported in the media. One source even corrected its article and clarified the misunderstanding.|$|E
500|$|By 1980, {{there were}} a number of {{unlicensed}} nightclubs operating on Denmark Place, running adjacent to the street. The clubs were housed in buildings that had previously functioned as a hostel for musicians, which adjoined a music shop on the street, and the fire brigade had insisted that a fire escape be fitted. By the time the clubs were in operation, the shop had closed and <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>escape</b> had fallen into disrepair. 18 Denmark Place was home to two such clubs; on the first floor was [...] "Rodo's", a salsa club popular with South American immigrants and above that [...] "The Spanish Rooms" [...] on the second floor which was a late night bar frequented by locals including Irish and Jamaican immigrants. On 14 August 1980 John Thompson, a local petty criminal, was ejected from The Spanish Rooms following a fight which may have been caused by a dispute about being overcharged. Thompson returned shortly thereafter and poured petrol into the ground floor of the building and ignited it. The inferno resulting from this act of arson killed 37 people from eight different nationalities and was described as the worst fire in London in terms of loss of life since World War II. Thompson was imprisoned having been convicted of murder and died in prison in 2008 on the anniversary of the tragedy.|$|E

2500|$|Eddie and Jake {{give their}} {{statements}} at police headquarters. Jake learns that Eddie {{wanted to be}} a policeman like his father. But he lost an eye in a training accident, and having a glass eye means he cannot now join the force. The two go to Eddie's place and start having sex. [...] Jake handcuffs Eddie to his bed and goes in search of condoms. As he's returning, the killer stabs him and leaves him for dead. Eddie hears the struggle and calls out. As the killer approaches and Eddie struggles with the cuffs, Jake hits the killer from behind with a baseball bat. Eddie slips a hand out of the cuffs, tends to Jake's wound and heads off to call an ambulance, but the killer wakes and disables the phone. Eddie runs to the kitchen. He finds a knife but also finds the heads of Joey, Chaz, and Tobey in a closet. Eddie evades the killer and retreats to his bedroom, locking Jake and himself in. As the killer chops at the door, Eddie retrieves his father's gun and some bullets. Eddie pushes Jake out onto <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>escape</b> and loads the gun. The killer breaks down the door and attacks Eddie again, knocking him out the window and over <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>escape</b> railing. As Eddie dangles from <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>escape,</b> the killer turns toward Jake. Eddie fires the gun, grazing Jake (as Eddie lacks the stereoscopic vision and depth perception to aim well). Eddie fires again, hitting the killer in the forehead.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{days after}} the murders, Speck was {{identified}} by a drifter named Claude Lunsford. Speck, Lunsford, and another man had been drinking the evening of July 15 on <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>escape</b> of the Starr Hotel at 617 W. Madison. On July 16, Lunsford recognized a sketch of the murderer in the evening paper and phoned the police at 9:30p.m. after finding Speck in his (Lunsford's) room at the Starr Hotel. The police, however, {{did not respond to}} the call although their records showed it had been made. Speck then attempted suicide, and the Starr Hotel desk clerk phoned in the emergency around midnight. Speck was taken to Cook County Hospital at 12:30a.m. on July 17. At the hospital, Speck was recognized by Dr. LeRoy Smith, a 25-year-old surgical resident physician, who had read about the [...] "Born To Raise Hell" [...] tattoo in a newspaper story. The police were called. Speck was arrested. Concerns over the recent Miranda case that had vacated the convictions of a number of criminals meant Speck was not even questioned for three weeks after his arrest.|$|E
2500|$|In 1948 in an {{apartment}} in Harlem, Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of William Blake (later referred to as his [...] "Blake vision"). At first, Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God, but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading Ah, Sunflower, The Sick Rose, and Little Girl Lost, also described by Ginsberg as [...] "voice of the ancient of days". The experience lasted several days. Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe. He looked at lattice-work on <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>escape</b> and realized some hand had crafted that; he then looked {{at the sky and}} intuited that some hand had crafted that also, or rather, that the sky was the hand that crafted itself. He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use, but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs. Ginsberg stated: [...] "living blue hand itself. [...] Or that God was {{in front of my eyes}} - existence itself was God" [...] and [...] "And it was a sudden awakening into a totally deeper real universe than I'd been existing in." ...|$|E
40|$|The Prescribed Burn Risk Assessment Tool (BRAT) aims {{to improve}} the {{planning}} and conduct of prescribed burns. It provides <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> manager with a means to assess the risk of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>escaping</b> (likelihood of impact), the potential to do damage if it does escape (consequence), the effects of escape mitigation strategies in reducing the probability of escapes, and {{the potential benefits of}} the operation in meeting fire management objectives (benefits). This tool uses the concepts outlined in the Australian Standard for Risk Management (AS/NZS 4360 : 2004), a Standard applicable {{to a wide range of}} industries and situations. This standard provides a framework for establishing the risk management context and methods of analysis, evaluation, treatment, monitoring and communication of risk. The practitioner enters a ”low”, “moderate ” or “high ” rating for each of the escape risk factors, potential impact factors and the potential risk reduction benefit of the burn. These ratings are based on a defined range of conditions for each factor. The spreadsheet then calculates the risk score for that criterion and combines them for all factors to produce an overall risk rating for the likelihood of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>escaping,</b> <b>the</b> risk of causing damage and the level of benefit to be potentially gained by...|$|R
