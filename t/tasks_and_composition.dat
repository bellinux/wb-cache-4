40|$|In Experiments 3 and 4, event-related {{potentials}} {{were recorded}} {{to verify the}} findings of the first two behavioral experiments. Similarly, Experiment 3 employed the lexical decision task and Experiment 4 used the position decision task. First, results revealed that a series of ERP components (P 150, P 200, and N 400) were found {{to be related to the}} effect of position-specific radical frequency when the lexical decision task was used (Experiment 3). However, when replacing the lexical decision task with the position decision task but keeping illegal characters as fillers, the effect of position-specific radical frequency became quite weak, which was only associated with P 200 (Experiment 4 a). Moreover, when using the position decision task but replacing illegal characters with geometric figures as fillers, there were no effects of position-specific radical frequency any more (Experiment 4 b). Second, the task was found to influence the time course for effects of position-free radical frequency, which was reflected by P 200 in the lexical decision task (Experiment 3) and by N 400 in the position decision task (Experiments 4 a and 4 b). Finally, simple character frequency could play a role in processing compound characters in which simple characters were used as radicals, but such effect was significant only in the position decision task and it was reflected by a change in N 400 (Experiments 4 a and 4 b). These findings indicate that position-specific radicals could play a role in character recognition, but this effect appears to be constrained by the task and/or the composition of materials. In contrast, effects of position-free radicals keep stable across different <b>tasks</b> <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> of materials. In addition, the findings also suggest that simple character information could exert influence on compound character processing, but only when characters are processed implicitly (e. g., in the position decision task). Implications of this research and future directions are discussed. This research was designed to examine the processing of different kinds of radical frequency information, i. e. frequency as a position-free radical, frequency as a position-specific radical, and frequency as a stand alone character. Whether the task or the composition of materials could influence the processing of such information was also examined. The first two were behavioral experiments and results indicated that effect of the position-free radical frequency was stable across the lexical decision task (Experiment 1) and the position decision task (Experiment 2). Effect of the position-specific radical frequency emerged only when the lexical decision task was available (Experiment 1). Wu, Yan. Adviser: Hsuan Chih Chen.

The notion of cognitive <b>task</b> <b>and</b> its use {{for the evaluation of}} intelligent systems is still replete with issues. The view of tasks as MDP in the context of reinforcement learning has been especially useful for the formalisation of learning tasks. However, this alternate interaction does not accommodate well for some other tasks that are usual in artificial intelligence and, most especially, in animal and human evaluation. In particular, {{we want to have a}} more general account of episodes, rewards and responses, and, most especially, the computational complexity of the algorithm behind an agent solving a task. This is crucial for the determination of the difficulty of a task as the (logarithm of the) number of computational steps required to acquire an acceptable policy for the task, which includes the exploration of policies and their verification. We introduce a notion of asynchronous-time stochastic tasks. Based on this interpretation, we can see what task difficulty is, what instance difficulty is (relative to a <b>task)</b> <b>and</b> also what <b>task</b> <b>compositions</b> <b>and</b> decompositions are.

40|$|Abstract. When {{creating}} an execution-level process model today, two crucial problems are {{how to find}} the right services (service discovery <b>and</b> <b>composition),</b> <b>and</b> how {{to make sure they are}} in the right order (semantic process validation). While isolated solutions for both problems exist, a unified approach has not yet been available. Our approach resolves this shortcoming by gathering all existing information in the process, thus making the basis of semantic service discovery <b>and</b> <b>task</b> <b>composition</b> both broader <b>and</b> more targeted. Thereby we achieve the following benefits: (i) less modeling overhead for semantic annotations to the process, (ii) more information regarding the applicability of services, and (iii) early avoidance of inconsistencies in the interrelation between all process parts. Consequently, new or changed business processes can be realized in IT more efficiently and with fewer errors, thus making enterprises more agile in response to new requirements and opportunities. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} deploy large teams of fully {{autonomous}} robots in a complex, dynamic environment (the proverbial real world), {{where they can}} collaborate with humans {{over an extended period}} of time, remains an open grand challenge. Considerable progress is being made towards many components of this task, including on-board sensor technology, physical agility, and power management. However one component that still requires significant research to be realized is the ability of a team of robots to learn to improve its performance by: (1) adapting the focus of heterogeneous sensing and computational resources to changing environments, <b>tasks</b> <b>and</b> team <b>compositions,</b> <b>and</b> (2) leveraging guidance from human team members via cognitively simple (i. e., low-effort) real-time interactions. We are guided by the observation that human-robot interactions in the real world are characterized by three challenging properties and constraints namely partial observability, constrained sensor processing, and limited human attention. In order to address these properties, we propose three concrete research thrusts based on the themes of probabilistic reasoning about sensing actions using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) [2] and the Information Maximization (Info-Max) principle [4]; and enabling human guidance of learning robots via positive or negative reinforcements.

A distinction is made between the global and the individual points of view of the interaction between the services. Interaction protocols (or choreographies) capture the interaction as a whole, defining the rules that entities should respect in order to guarantee the interoperability; they do not refer to specific services but they specify the roles and the communication among the roles. Policies (behavioral interfaces in web service terminology), instead, focus on communication {{from the point of view}} of the individual services.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} applies formal {{methods to}} the automatic generation of interactive systems from multiple declarative models. We {{are interested in}} two kinds of models: user-task and presentation. The MASTERMIND Dialogue Language (MDL) is presented. MDL is a notation for describing interactive system behavior in terms of user tasks. MDL task models are expressed independently of other models, like presentation, but are later composed with the behavior of these other models. Such separation is important for preserving the integrity of models over the lifetime of a system. The technical challenge in this approach is to generate code that combines the functionality of <b>task</b> <b>and</b> presentation models without violating that integrity. To meet this challenge we implement MDL task models as run-time dialogue constraints that synchronize with presentation components. The constraint engine is implemented as a virtual machine that simulates the execution of <b>tasks</b> <b>and</b> resolves the dependencies that arise {{as a result of}} <b>task</b> <b>and</b> presentation model <b>composition.</b> To simplify the generation process, a toolkit of reusable run-time components is provided. Each component in this toolkit implements an MDL operator, and components aggregate into trees whose structure corresponds one-to-one with the abstract syntax tree of a corresponding MDL model. Thus implementations can be generated through a simple syntactic transformation of the MDL source code. The design correctness of these components is validated by a novel application of symbolic model checking. The run-time attributes of systems generated using this approach are measured, and we conclude that this strategy of model composition is feasible for use with real interactive systems...|$|R

The first is captured in governance decisions, {{and the latter}} in a transactive memory system (TMS), a shared cognitive system for encoding, storing and retrieving knowledge between members of a group. Objective We seek to identify how different governance decisions (such as business strategy, team configuration, task allocation) affect the structure of transactive memory systems {{as well as the}} processes developed within those systems. Method We use both a quantitative and a qualitative approach. We collect quantitative data through an online survey to identify transactive memory systems. We analyze transactive memory structures using social network analysis techniques and we build a latent variable model to measure transactive memory processes. We further support and triangulate our results by means of interviews, which also help us examine the GSD governance modes of the participating projects. We analyze governance modes, as set of decisions based on three aspects; business strategy, team structure <b>and</b> <b>composition,</b> <b>and</b> <b>task</b> allocation. Results Our results suggest that different governance decisions have a different impact on transactive memory systems. Offshore insourcing as a business strategy, for instance, creates tightly-connected clusters, which in turn leads to better developed transactive memory processes. We also find that within the <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> structure of GSD teams, there are boundary spanners (formal or informal) who have a better overview of the network's activities and become central members within their network. An interesting mapping between <b>task</b> allocation <b>and</b> the <b>composition</b> of the network core suggests that the way tasks are allocated among distributed teams is an indicator of where expertise resides.

This study describes development of a new test for measuring functional performance of the upper extremity and neck and assesses reliability and concurrent validity in patients with shoulder pathology. Methods A series of developmental tests were conducted to develop a protocol for assessing upper extremity tasks that required multi-level movement and sustained elevation. Kinematics of movement were investigated to inform subtask structure. <b>Tasks</b> <b>and</b> test <b>composition</b> were refined to fit clinical applicability criteria and pilot tested on 5 patients awaiting surgery for shoulder impingement and age-sex matched controls. Test-retest reliability was assessed on 10 subjects. Then a cohort of patients with mild to moderate (n = 17) shoulder pathology and 19 controls (17 were age-sex matched to patients) were tested to further validate the Functional Impairment Test-Hand, and Neck/Shoulder/Arm (FIT-HaNSA) by comparing it to self-reported function and measured strength. The FIT-HaNSA, DASH and SPADI were tested on a single occasion. Impairments in isometric strength were measured using hand-held dynamometry. Discriminative validity was determined by comparing scores to those of age-sex matched controls (n = 34), using ANOVA. Pearson correlations between outcome measures (n = 41) were examined to establish criterion and convergent validity. Results A test protocol based on three five-minute subtasks, each either comprised of moving objects to waist-height shelves, eye-level shelves, or sustained manipulation of overhead nuts/bolts, was developed. Test scores for the latter 2 subtasks (or total scores) were different between controls as compared to either surgical-list patients with shoulder impingement or a variety of milder shoulder pathologies (p Conclusion Initial data suggest the FIT-HaNSA provides valid assessment of impaired functional performance in patients with shoulder pathology.

One hundred sixty-four second- and one hundred thirty-two third graders were given five problems on both the resolution <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> <b>task.</b> Children were asked to resolve a number into X and Y and Z in the resolution <b>task,</b> <b>and</b> were asked to compose some numbers in the composition task. The results showed that it was not easy for children to solve correctly both the resolution <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> <b>task.</b> Furthermore, the strategies children used indicated that children adopted the procedural strategies more often than the conceptual strategies. These results suggested that children did not understand the conceptual bases for understanding the part-whole schema in whole numbers, Children 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation of numbers using the part and whole relationships were discussed in terms of the conceptual and procedural knowledge...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article was to {{investigate}} the influence of additional players and playing position on the network properties during 2 x 4 minutes small-sided and conditioned games (SSCG) in soccer. Eighteen young soccer players (age 16. 4 ± 0. 7 years), six defenders, six midfielders, and six forwards, voluntarily participated in SSCGs with different task conditions (4 vs. 3, with an additional player inside the pitch, 3 vs. 3 + 2, with two support players {{at the side of the}} pitch, and 3 vs. 3, numerical equality). General (density, total links and clustering coefficient) and individual (degree centrality, degree prestige, and page rank) network properties were analyzed using the SocNetV® software. Results showed higher values of density (F= 59. 354, p=. 001), total links (F= 40. 951, p=. 001), and clustering coefficient (F= 21. 851, p=. 001) during the 4 vs. 3 SSCG. Besides, midfielders showed higher values of degree centrality than defenders and forwards (F= 10. 669, p=. 001). Midfielders and forwards also showed higher values of degree prestige than defenders (F= 5. 527, p=. 005). These results indicate that both <b>task</b> condition <b>and</b> playing position influence the general and individual network properties during SSCGs. For this reason, it is suggested that both <b>task</b> condition <b>and</b> team <b>composition</b> need to be adjusted to the coaches’ purpose for each training session in order to maximize the possibilities of cooperation among the teammates...|$|R
