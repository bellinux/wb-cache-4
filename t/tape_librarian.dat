The IBM Data Cell picker was among several IBM trademarked [...] "speedy" [...] mass online direct-access storage peripherals (reincarnated {{in recent years as}} [...] "virtual tape" [...] and automated <b>tape</b> <b>librarian</b> peripherals). The 2321 file had a capacity of 400 MB, at the time when the 2311 disk drive only had 7.2 MB. The IBM Data Cell was proposed to fill cost/capacity/speed gap between magnetic tapes—which had high capacity with relatively low cost per stored byte—and disks, which had higher expense per byte. Some installations also found the electromechanical operation less dependable and opted for less mechanical forms of direct-access storage.|$|E
