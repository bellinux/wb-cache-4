500|$|The largest {{event of}} Clark's tenure as SACEUR was NATO's {{confrontation}} with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the Kosovo War. On September 22, 1998, the United Nations Security Council introduced Resolution 1199 calling {{for an end to}} hostilities in Kosovo, and Richard Holbrooke again tried to negotiate a peace. This process came to an unsuccessful end, however, following the Račak massacre. Then U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright tried to force Yugoslavia into allowing separation of Kosovo with the Rambouillet Agreement, which Yugoslavia refused. Clark was at the Rambouillet talks and tried to convince Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milošević by telling him [...] "there's an activation order. And if they <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> bomb you, I'm going to bomb you good." [...] Clark later said Milošević launched into an emotional tirade against Albanians and said that they'd been [...] "handled" [...] in the 1940s by ethnic cleansing.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, OutKast's {{original}} {{record label}} Arista Records was restructured under the Jive label group. During their hiatus, Big Boi and André 3000 were pressured by Jive {{to produce an}} OutKast album {{instead of focusing on}} their solo work. In July 2009, Big Boi left Jive Records, following creative differences and the label's unwillingness to release and promote his solo album. According to Big Boi, Jive gave him an ultimatum to shop the album elsewhere. In an interview for GQ, he discussed his release from Jive and his discontent with the label for proposing he record a cover of rapper Lil Wayne's [...] "Lollipop", stating [...] "They told me to go in and make my version of Lil Wayne's Lollipop! I love that song... But how you gonna <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go bite another MCs style?... That's the highest form of disrespect ever. So that's when I wanted to get off Jive. And the only honorable thing they've done is allow me to do that". Big Boi expressed that Jive viewed its intended singles as not [...] "radio-friendly" [...] and the album as [...] "a piece of art, and they didn't {{know what to do with}} it".|$|E

When Wu's [...] "I Have to Deal With Stereotypes" [...] video was {{featured}} on YouTube's home page, his number of viewers began to increase. In this video, Wu talks about stereotypes he {{has to deal with}} as an Asian-American. He tries to disprove his cheapness by bragging about the recent purchase of a [...] "brand new, top-of-the-line, TI-84 calculator". He acknowledges that this might make him nerdy but dismisses this stereotype too as he does not [...] "make all A's...in school today [...] made a B+." [...] He is then greeted by a voice {{that was supposed to be}} his mother calling him a loser and accusing him of dishonoring their family. Wu goes on to say he can prove his predominant social life with the constant ringing of his cell phone. At this point, his phone indeed rings, he answers it, and the voice on the other end to Wu's disappointment says, [...] "Hey, why did you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> call you?" [...] Wu has collaborated with fellow YouTube comedian Christine Gambito (HappySlip), making five videos with her. In one of Kevin's older videos, he said he was an only child, which was later proven wrong by his father.|$|E

500|$|Initially, Monteverdi {{had little}} enthusiasm for Le nozze di Tetide, and sought ways of {{avoiding}} or delaying work on it. He would accept the commission, he informed Striggio on 9 December 1616, {{because it was the}} wish of the duke, his feudal lord. However, the verses he was given were not, he felt, conducive to beautiful music. He found the tale difficult to understand, and did not think he could be inspired by it. In any event he was occupied for most of December in writing a Christmas Eve mass for St Mark's. On 29 December, perhaps hoping that the commission would be withdrawn, Monteverdi told Striggio that he was ready to begin work on Le Nozze di Tetide [...] "if you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do so". In January 1617, however, he became more enthusiastic on learning that the project had been scaled down and was now being projected as a series of intermedi. He informed Striggio that what he had first considered a rather monotonous piece he now thought fully appropriate to the occasion. He began work on the recitative sections, but before he could start setting the more expressive numbers, the duke {{had a change of heart}} and cancelled Monteverdi's commission. Le nozze di Tetide was abandoned; its libretto and whatever music existed have disappeared.|$|E
500|$|Lavigne's {{feature film}} debut was voicing an {{animated}} {{character in the}} 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, [...] "All the actors went in individually, and [...] Tim and [...] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with {{no one else to}} kind of feed off of." [...] Lavigne found the recording process to be [...] "easy" [...] and [...] "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. [...] "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." [...] Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. [...] " [...] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude". The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Eastwood and Locke {{went on to}} star in The Gauntlet, Every Which Way But Loose, Bronco Billy, Any Which Way You Can and Sudden Impact. According {{to former}} {{longtime}} associate Fritz Manes, as quoted by author McGilligan, Eastwood was devoted to her between 1976 and 1980 at the least, but discreetly kept up several [...] "maintenance relationships" [...] (such as with Tunis) during that period. McGilligan claims Eastwood returned to his [...] "habitual womanizing" [...] in the early 1980s, becoming involved with story analyst Megan Rose, actress Jamie Rose (who played a bit part in Tightrope), animal rights activist Jane Brolin (who had intermittent liaisons with Eastwood between the early 1960s and late 1980s) and Jacelyn Reeves, a stewardess he met at the Hog's Breath Inn, among others. He was still living with Locke when he conceived two children with Reeves: a son Scott Eastwood (born Scott Reeves; March 21, 1986) and daughter Kathryn Eastwood (born Kathryn Reeves; February 2, 1988), whose birth certificates both said [...] "Father declined." [...] The affair with Reeves was not reported anywhere until an exposé article {{was published in the}} Star tabloid in 1990. It quoted Reeves as saying [...] "Some family members <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> file a paternity suit against Clint, but I don't want to." [...] The children continued to be unacknowledged by mainstream news sources {{for more than a decade}} thereafter. Eastwood's relationship with Locke (at the time unaware of his infidelities) ended acrimoniously in April 1989, and the post-breakup litigation dragged on for years. Locke filed a palimony lawsuit against him after he changed the locks on their home and moved her possessions into storage when she was at work filming her second directorial feature, Impulse. In court, Eastwood downplayed the intensity of their relationship. He described Locke as a [...] "roommate" [...] before quickly redescribing her as a [...] "part-time roommate." [...] Locke's estranged brother told The Tennessean that Eastwood still truly loved her, but could no longer take her [...] "addiction" [...] to husband Gordon Anderson. Anticipating that Eastwood was going to misrepresent the marriage, Locke asked Anderson to surrender all claims on any of her assets that as her legal spouse he was entitled to. [...] "In an extraordinary gesture of love and faith in me, Gordon signed away everything without hesitation." [...] During the trial, an investigative journalist contacted Locke and informed her of Eastwood's other family. [...] "I spoke with the nurse in the delivery room, and she confirmed that they are Clint's children. I'll send copies of the birth certificates to you and a photo of Jacelyn, if you want them," [...] Locke quotes the informant. [...] "My mind was still searching to get all his actions lined up. For at least the last four years of our relationship, Clint had been living this double life, going between me and this other woman, and having children with her. Two babies had been born during the last three years of our relationship, and they weren't mine." [...] As the case went on, Locke developed breast cancer and said the treatments sapped her will to fight. She dropped her suit in November 1990 in exchange for a settlement package which included a lump sum plus monthly payments from Eastwood and a $1.5 million directing deal at Warner Bros., but sued him again for fraud in 1995 when she became convinced the deal with Warner was a sham, finally settling out of court in September 1996. Since then, Locke has made discrediting comments about Eastwood.|$|E

2500|$|... "Don't Tell Me" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna, Mirwais Ahmadzaï, Joe Henry, with the former two also {{producing}} it. Ahmadzaï also provided programming, acoustic guitars and keyboards, while Michel Colombier arranged strings. It was composed using common time in the key of D major, with a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. Madonna's vocals range from the lower octave of G3 to the higher note of A4. Sonically, [...] "Don't Tell Me" [...] was considered [...] "a country meets dance" [...] track with trip hop beats infused with an acoustic [...] "folksy" [...] riff. During an interview for Interview Magazine, in March 2001, Madonna discussed the lyrics, stating, [...] "To me it is a romantic song. Just, you know, rip my skin off, do not tell me who I should love, or how I should love. Don’t <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> give up.
