5|$|Hamilton {{was among}} those {{dissatisfied}} with the weak national government. He led the Annapolis Convention, which successfully influenced Congress to issue a call for the Philadelphia Convention {{in order to create}} a new constitution. He was an active participant at Philadelphia, and he helped achieve ratification by writing 51 of the 85 installments of <b>The</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Papers</b> which, to this day, are the single most important reference for Constitutional interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Federal judges, when {{interpreting}} the Constitution, frequently use <b>The</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Papers</b> as a contemporary {{account of the}} intentions of the framers and ratifiers. They have been applied on issues ranging from the power of the federal government in foreign affairs (in Hines v. Davidowitz) to the validity of ex post facto laws (in the 1798 decision Calder v. Bull, apparently the first decision to mention The Federalist). , The Federalist had been quoted 291 times in Supreme Court decisions.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton's faction {{were against}} any {{conditional}} ratification, {{under the impression}} that New York would not be accepted into the Union, while Clinton's faction wanted to amend the Constitution, while maintaining the state's right to secede if their attempts failed. During the state convention, New Hampshire and Virginia becoming the ninth and tenth states to ratify the Constitution, respectively, had ensured any adjournment would not happen and a compromise would have to be reached. Hamilton's arguments used for the ratifications were largely iterations of work from <b>The</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Papers,</b> and Smith eventually went for ratification, though it was more out of necessity than Hamilton's rhetoric. The vote in the state constitution was ratified 30 to 27, on July 26, 1788.|$|E
50|$|But success {{came at a}} price. The paper's staff became {{increasingly}} insular, refusing to recruit members as older staffers graduated, believing itself capable of running on nothing. By Fall 1997, the staff dwindled to two editors, who produced only one mammoth issue. As the spring semester of 1998 opened, their layout computer crashed, taking with it all records and templates. <b>The</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Paper</b> was finished.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{the prior}} incarnation, however, {{the editors of}} The Fed {{recruited}} heavily and often, with antics like the [...] "Fed Bash" [...] (see below) and their Orientation issues distributed to every incoming student's dorm room providing fresh faces and new ideas. As those that remembered <b>The</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Paper</b> graduated and publications like The Onion rose to national prominence, The Fed moved firmly {{in the direction of}} humor.|$|R
5000|$|By 1990, <b>The</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Paper</b> {{was already}} feeling the pinch of low content. Issues from the era display an {{increasing}} disregard for layout and copy-editing (a charge, ironically, often leveled {{at the paper}} regardless of the format), a decline in advertising from former stalwarts such as Coors and Kaplan, and an editorial board that drew almost exclusively conservative commentators. The board of 1992, after a fierce debate, recommitted itself to the [...] "classically liberal" [...] stance of the founders and began a charge towards diversity of opinions.|$|R
5|$|In modern history, orators such as Henry Clay would mimic Demosthenes's technique. His {{ideas and}} {{principles}} survived, influencing prominent politicians and movements of our times. Hence, he constituted {{a source of}} inspiration for the authors of <b>The</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Papers</b> (a series of 85 essays arguing for the ratification of the United States Constitution) and for the major orators of the French Revolution. French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau was among those who idealised Demosthenes and wrote a book about him. For his part, Friedrich Nietzsche often composed his sentences according to the paradigms of Demosthenes, whose style he admired.* P. J. M. Van Tongeren, Reinterpreting Modern Culture, 92.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Papers</b> (specifically Federalist No. 84) are {{notable for}} their {{opposition}} to what later became the United States Bill of Rights. The idea of adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution was originally controversial because the Constitution, as written, did not specifically enumerate or {{protect the rights of}} the people, rather it listed the powers of the government and left all that remained to the states and the people. Alexander Hamilton, the author of Federalist No. 84, feared that such an enumeration, once written down explicitly, would later be interpreted as a list of the only rights that people had.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{recruited}} John Jay and James Madison {{to write}} a series of essays defending the proposed Constitution, now known as <b>The</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Papers,</b> and made the largest contribution to that effort, writing 51 of 85 essays published (Madison wrote 29, Jay only five). Hamilton supervised the entire project, enlisted the participants, wrote {{the majority of the}} essays, and oversaw the publication. During the project each person was responsible for their areas of expertise. Jay covered foreign relations, Madison covered the history of republics and confederacies, along with the anatomy of the new government and Hamilton covered the branches of government most pertinent to him: the executive and judicial branches, with some aspects of the Senate, as well as covering military matters and taxation The papers first appeared in The Independent Journal on October 27, 1787.|$|E
5000|$|John Jay, in <b>The</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>paper</b> No. 2, stated that: [...] "Nothing is {{more certain}} than the {{indispensable}} necessity of Government, {{and it is}} equally undeniable, that whenever and however it is instituted, the people must cede to it some of their natural rights, in order to vest it with requisite powers." [...] Jay's meaning would be better expressed by substituting [...] "negative liberty" [...] in place of [...] "natural rights", for the argument {{here is that the}} power or authority of a legitimate government derives in part from our accepting restrictions on negative liberty.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> 14th <b>Federalist</b> <b>Paper,</b> {{written by}} James Madison, {{addressed}} {{the topics of}} identifying the form of government which the Union was trying to attain, {{the size of the}} Union, the separation of powers between the central government and the States, the traveling within the Union, and the benefits in regards to States at the borderline of the Union.|$|R
5|$|The {{bill passed}} through the Senate {{practically}} without a problem, but objections of the proposal increased {{by the time it}} reached the House of Representatives. It was generally held by critics that Hamilton was serving the interests of the Northeast by means of the bank, and those of the agrarian lifestyle would not benefit from it. Among those critics was James Jackson of Georgia, who also attempted to refute the report by quoting from <b>The</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Papers.</b> Madison and Jefferson also opposed the bank bill. The potential of the capital not being moved to the Potomac if the bank was to have a firm establishment in Philadelphia (the current capital of the United States) was a more significant reason, and actions that Pennsylvania members of Congress took to keep the capital there made both men anxious.|$|E
25|$|During colonial America, all able-bodied men {{of certain}} ages were {{eligible}} for the militia. Individual towns formed local independent militias for their own defense.

25|$|The ongoing {{partitions}} of Poland were a major {{topic of}} discourse in <b>The</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Papers,</b> where {{the structure of}} the government of Poland, and of foreign influence over it, is used in several papers (Federalist No. 14, Federalist No. 19, Federalist No. 22, Federalist No. 39 for examples) as a cautionary tale for the writers of the U.S. Constitution.|$|E

5000|$|New York was {{the swing}} {{state in the}} 1800 {{election}} that saw President Thomas Jefferson elected by one vote in the electoral college. Harry Croswell was a staunch Federalist, {{one of those who}} opposed Jefferson. When Connecticut newspaper editor Charles Holt moved to Hudson and founded the Democratic-Republican Party paper The Bee, Croswell countered by founding <b>the</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>paper</b> <b>The</b> Wasp. [...] Croswell's political humor and darting jabs and stings at the President, New York Governor George Clinton, Attorney General Ambrose Spencer, {{and the rest of the}} Jefferson party apparatus down to the local sheriff and editor Holt, were so effective, that it was feared he would influence the election of 1804 against Jefferson. Jefferson wrote to one of his party's governors: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Anti <b>Federalist</b> <b>Papers</b> was written, before <b>the</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>paper,</b> by <b>the</b> {{founding}} fathers who {{were opposed to}} {{the merits of the}} United Stated Constitution. Three papers touch on the aspects of the Senate defended in Federalist 64. Anti-Federalist 62 discusses how the members of the senate should be chosen, and the organization of them. People believed that if the chosen senate worked for a long time, they would begin to only make decisions for themselves. It says, [...] "The term for which the senate are to be chosen, is in my judgment too long, and no provision being made for a rotation will, I conceive, be of dangerous consequence". Anti-Federalist paper 63 states opinions on the amount of people in the senate, and problems that may come. The writer agrees that the senate taking part will be beneficial, but thinks that it will eventually become [...] "the source of the greatest evils" [...] Finally, Anti-Federalist 64 speaks about the beliefs that the constitution of the senate sends fear and little hope to the democratic rights. [...] "which will swallow up the democratic rights and liberties of the nation...that we have much to fear from it, and little to hope, and then it must necessarily produce a baneful aristocracy, by which the democratic rights of the people will be overwhelmed".|$|R
25|$|Columbia Law School {{was founded}} in 1858 as the Columbia College Law School and was known for its legal {{scholarship}} {{dating back to the}} 18th century. Graduates of the university's colonial predecessor, King's College, include such notable early-American legal figures as John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and Alexander Hamilton, first Secretary of the Treasury and co-author of <b>The</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Papers.</b>|$|E
25|$|In <b>The</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Papers,</b> James Madison {{explained}} {{his views on}} {{the selection of the}} president and the Constitution. In Federalist No. 39, Madison argued the Constitution was designed to be a mixture of state-based and population-based government. Congress would have two houses: the state-based Senate and the population-based House of Representatives. Meanwhile, the president would be elected by a mixture of the two modes.|$|E
25|$|Federalist No. 70, titled “The Executive Department Further Considered,” is {{an essay}} written by Alexander Hamilton arguing for the unitary {{executive}} provided {{for in the}} United States Constitution. It was originally published on March 15, 1788 in The New York Packet under the pseudonym Publius as part of <b>The</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Papers</b> and as the fourth in Hamilton’s series of eleven essays discussing executive power.|$|E
5000|$|Physiocrat {{influence}} in the United States came by Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson as Ambassadors to France, and Jefferson brought his friend Pierre du Pont to the United States to promote the idea. A statement in <b>the</b> 36th <b>Federalist</b> <b>Paper</b> reflects that influence, [...] "A small land tax will answer {{the purpose of the}} States, and will be their most simple and most fit resource." ...|$|R
5000|$|In <b>the</b> 54th <b>Federalist</b> Paper: <b>The</b> Apportionment of Members Among the States, author, James Madison, {{reveals his}} {{defenses}} and arguments behind {{a portion of}} the United States Constitution, called the Three Fifths Compromise. Madison created <b>the</b> 54th <b>Federalist</b> <b>Paper</b> in order to influence the American public that the compromise was in fact, a successful solution to the differences between the North and the South regions. Although Madison was a strong supporter of the Constitution, he personally felt conflicted about the concept of slavery, which inevitably, left him feeling obligated to defend the three-fifths rule. Throughout the Apportionment of Members Among the States, Madison eventually recognizes that the lives of the slaves are initially considered property under the law, because of the slaves compelling labor, constant trade, and in the end, their liberty was constrained, much like property. Essentially, Madison argues that the law protects the lives of slaves as property, and as a person because in reality, slaveholders could receive punishment for the harm of others. Madison continues to argue through the content of <b>the</b> 54th <b>Federalist</b> <b>Paper,</b> that by <b>the</b> defense of the Constitution and in support of the Three Fifths Compromise, that slaves should be represented with a mixed characteristics, as both property and person ...|$|R
50|$|There is no {{provision}} {{for the role of}} political parties in the United States Constitution, since the Founding Fathers did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan. In <b>Federalist</b> <b>Papers</b> No. 9 and No. 10, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, respectively, wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic political factions. Thus in the first two presidential elections, the Electoral College handled the nominations and elections in 1789 and 1792 that selected George Washington. The beginnings of the American two-party system then emerged from Washington's immediate circle of advisors. Hamilton and Madison, who wrote <b>the</b> aforementioned <b>Federalist</b> <b>Papers</b> against political factions, ended up being the core leaders in this partisanship: Hamilton became <b>the</b> leader of <b>Federalist</b> Party while Madison co-helmed the Democratic-Republican Party with Thomas Jefferson.|$|R
25|$|The society's name {{is said to}} {{have been}} based on the {{eighteenth-century}} Federalist Party, however, James Madison associated with Thomas Jefferson and the Democratic-Republican Party in opposition to Federalist Party policies borne from a loose interpretation of the Commerce Clause. The society's views are more associated with the general meaning of Federalism (particularly the New Federalism) and the content of <b>the</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Papers</b> than with the later Federalist Party.|$|E
25|$|The drafted Constitution was {{submitted}} to the Confederation Congress. It in turn forwarded the Constitution as drafted to the states for ratification by the Constitutional method proposed. <b>The</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Papers</b> provided background and justification for the Constitution. Some states agreed to ratify the Constitution only if the amendments that were to become the Bill of Rights would be taken up immediately by the new government, and they were duly proposed in the first session of the First Congress.|$|E
25|$|In New York, fully {{two thirds}} of the {{convention}} delegates were at first opposed to the Constitution. Hamilton led the Federalist campaign, which included the fast-paced appearance of <b>The</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Papers</b> in New York newspapers. An attempt to attach conditions to ratification almost succeeded, but on July 26, 1788, New York ratified, with a recommendation that a bill of rights be appended. The vote was close – yeas 30 (52.6%), nays 27 – due largely to Hamilton's forensic abilities and his reaching a few key compromises with moderate anti-Federalists led by Melancton Smith.|$|E
50|$|Hamilton’s {{finishing}} {{statement in}} Federalist 8 stated {{that if we}} were to protect the Union, we’d face years of enjoyment and live stress free as long as States work in harmony to guard each other. Taking the World Wars into perspective demonstrates the extent to which <b>the</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Paper</b> reaches to. Words spoken have never been truer, and it’s proven beyond the World Wars to the current generation. The global war on terrorism is a great example of how states or countries must work together {{to get rid of a}} common threat. Once they’ve understood the problem, the only solution will be determined in the form of teamwork. If the nations work together, it’s guaranteed that a solution will be formed, and the more “teammates” there are, the faster the answer will be found. The two nations doesn’t have to be only the U.S. and Europe working to fight against terrorism. Nations all over the world can work together to eliminate the opposition. If this is accomplished, Federalist 8 will remain relevant for as long as we live.|$|R
5000|$|Today, {{people are}} no longer {{concerned}} {{with the size of}} the House because it has been fixed at 435 members since The Apportionment Act of 1911 was passed. But, people are still concerned about the laws/ bills that the House of Representatives is passing. The House can make laws that create new taxes, it aids in determining the fiscal policy, it guides federal spending and taxation etc. The laws made by the House have can directly affect the population but as Madison said in <b>the</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Paper,</b> [...] "Were <b>the</b> pictures which have been drawn by the political jealousy of some among us faithful likenesses of the human character, the inference would be, that there is not sufficient virtue among men for self-government; and that nothing less than the chains of despotism can restrain them from destroying and devouring one another" [...] meaning, the Republican government depends on the virtue/trust of the people. [...] "Republican government presupposes the existence of these qualities in a higher degree than any other form government." ...|$|R
5000|$|Finally, in <b>the</b> {{very first}} <b>Federalist</b> <b>Paper,</b> page 1, {{paragraph}} 1, Alexander Hamilton launched the Founders’ {{argument for the}} Constitution’s ratification, by noting that [...] "it is commonly remarked" [...] that in creating this new nation, Americans were acting on behalf of, and for the benefit of, all mankind. [...] "This" [...] he wrote, [...] "adds the inducements of philanthropy to those of patriotism." ...|$|R
