5|$|The tomb of {{the lord}} of the goats: it is the largest in the necropolis; it {{includes}} two depositional chambers and is reached through a vertical shaft. The occupier of the tomb is not known with certainty, he is called the lord of <b>the</b> <b>goats</b> by archaeologists due to the existence of a throne decorated with bronze goat heads in the tomb. A silver cup that has the name of king Immeya inscribed was found in the tomb making that king the most likely owner of the burial.|$|E
5|$|Longleat Estate has fenced off a {{large part}} of its land and has {{introduced}} goats, as part of a programme to encourage the biodiversity of the area; <b>the</b> <b>goats</b> were intended to replace the sheep that grazed in the gorge until the 1970s. The National Trust announced in March 2007 that it plans to release a flock of sheep on its side of the gorge for the same purpose, but will first consult local residents and interested parties on whether to fence off the gorge or introduce cattle grids to prevent the sheep from straying. There is already a small flock of feral Soay sheep in the gorge.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the weekend}} of 3-4 December 2005 a series of attacks on public Yule Goats across Sweden were carried out; <b>The</b> Gävle <b>Goat</b> was burnt on 3 December. <b>The</b> Visby <b>goat</b> on Gotland burned down, <b>the</b> Yule <b>Goat</b> in Söderköping, Östergötland was torched, {{and there was an}} attack on a goat located in Lycksele, Västerbotten. [...] The Christmas season of 2006 marked the 40th anniversary of <b>the</b> Gävle <b>Goat,</b> and, on Sunday 3 December, the city held a large celebration in honor of <b>the</b> <b>goat.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Goat</b> Committee {{fireproofed}} <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> with [...] "Fiber ProTector Fireproof", a fireproofing substance that is used in airplanes. In earlier years when <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> had been fireproofed, the dew had made the liquid drip off <b>the</b> <b>goat.</b> To prevent this from happening in 2006, [...] "Fireproof ProTechtor Solvent Base" [...] was applied to <b>the</b> <b>goat.</b> Despite their efforts, <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> has been destroyed a total of 36 times, including the most recent incident, on 27 November 2016, when an arsonist equipped with petrol burned it down, just hours after its inauguration.|$|R
5000|$|The {{association}} initially preferred registered goats to be {{descended from}} known European breeds, but {{was willing to}} accept upgraded goats as well. [...] In addition to its eight currently registered breeds, the ADGA at one time registered several other breeds that are no longer available in North America, including <b>the</b> British Alpine <b>goat,</b> <b>the</b> Calcutta Llama, <b>the</b> Indian <b>goat,</b> <b>the</b> Maltese <b>goat,</b> <b>the</b> Murcien or Murciene, <b>the</b> Norska <b>goat</b> (and other Norwegian breeds), <b>the</b> Rock Alpine <b>goat,</b> <b>the</b> Rome <b>goat,</b> <b>the</b> Royal Murciana <b>goat,</b> and <b>the</b> Schwartzenberg-Guggisberger <b>goat.</b>|$|R
5|$|Pigs {{and goats}} were {{released}} {{on the island}} as potential food in the early 1800s, <b>the</b> <b>goats</b> destroying shrubs and grasses used as nesting sites and the pigs eating eggs and chicks and disturbing the land by nuzzling for food. Several birds have become extinct on the island since the arrival of humans. The first round of extinctions included the Lord Howe swamphen or white gallinule, white-throated pigeon, red-crowned parakeet and the Tasman booby, which were eliminated by visitors and settlers {{during the nineteenth century}} either from overhunting for food or protection of crops. Black rats were released from provisioning whaling ships in the 1840s and mice from Norfolk Island in 1860. In 1918 the black rat was accidentally introduced with the shipwreck of the SS Makambo which ran aground at Ned's Beach. This triggered a second wave of extinctions, including the vinous-tinted thrush, robust white-eye, Lord Howe starling, Lord Howe fantail and the Lord Howe gerygone as well as the destruction of the native phasmid and decimation of palm fruits. Bounties were offered for rat and pig tails and 'ratting' became a popular pursuit. Subsequent poisoning programs have kept populations low. The Lord Howe boobook may have become extinct through predation by, or competition with, the Tasmanian masked owls which were introduced in the 1920s in a failed attempt to control the rat population. Stray dogs are also a threat as they could harm the native wood hen and other birds.|$|E
5|$|The cuisine of Rwanda {{is based}} on local staple foods {{produced}} by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat {{more than a few}} times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering <b>the</b> <b>goats,</b> skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called urwagwa, made from sorghum or bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} <b>the</b> Gävle <b>goat</b> began in 1966. Stig Gavlén {{came up with}} the idea of placing a giant version of the {{traditional}} Swedish Christmas goat of straw in Slottstorget (Castle Square) in central Gävle. On 1 December the 13-metre tall, 7-metre long, 3 tonne goat was erected on the square. At midnight on New Year's Eve, <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> went up in flames. <b>The</b> <b>goat</b> has since had a history of being burnt almost every year, 2005 being the 22nd time it was burnt. Burning <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> is an illegal act and not welcomed by most citizens of Gävle, but undoubtedly this is what has made <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> famous. In 2006 <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> was covered in a flame-resistant coating to prevent arson, enabling <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> to remain standing throughout that winter. On December 27, 2015, <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> was burnt for the 28th time.|$|R

25|$|The Prose Edda relates {{that when}} Thor cooks <b>the</b> <b>goats,</b> their flesh {{provides}} sustenance for the god, and, after Thor resurrects {{them with his}} hammer, Mjölnir, they are brought back to life the next day. According to the same source, Thor once stayed {{a night at the}} home of peasant farmers and shared with them his goat meal, yet one of their children, Þjálfi, broke one of the bones to suck out the marrow, resulting in the lameness of one of <b>the</b> <b>goats</b> upon resurrection. As a result, Thor maintains Þjálfi and his sister Röskva as his servants. Scholars have linked the ever-replenishing goats to the nightly-consumed beast Sæhrímnir in Norse mythology and Scandinavian folk beliefs involving herring bones and witchcraft.|$|E
25|$|In chapter 44, Third reluctantly relates a tale where Thor and Loki {{are riding}} in Thor's chariot, which is pulled by his two goats.

Thor slaughters his goats, prepares them, puts them in a pot, and Loki and Thor sit down for their evening meal. Thor invites the peasant family who own the farm to share with him the meal he has prepared, but warns them not to break the bones. Afterward, at the {{suggestion}} of Loki, the peasant child Þjálfi sucks the bone marrow from one of the goat bones, and when Thor goes to resurrect <b>the</b> <b>goats,</b> he finds one of <b>the</b> <b>goats</b> to be lame. In their terror, the family atones to Thor by giving Thor their son Þjálfi and their daughter Röskva.|$|E
25|$|The Crozet Islands {{have been}} a nature reserve since 1938.

50|$|The {{characteristics}} {{sought after}} for a racing goat are strength, endurance, and speed. Animals are trained {{for at least}} two months prior to racing when speed and strength are developed. With a rope tied around <b>the</b> <b>goat's</b> neck, a trainer teaches <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> to walk progressively faster until <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> is running just ahead of or beside the trainer. The trainer also incorporates swimming to build <b>the</b> <b>goat's</b> strength and muscle mass. <b>The</b> <b>goat's</b> diet is carefully regulated to ensure peak performance on race day. Goats are trained on the beach or nearby pasture land. Race goats also known as steeds typically have owners, trainers, and jockeys.|$|R

25|$|Christian eschatology is {{concerned}} with death, an intermediate state, Heaven, hell, the return of Jesus, and {{the resurrection of the}} dead.
