50|$|The energy {{measures}} {{above are}} gross final energy consumption. Another broader measure, {{primary energy consumption}} also includes energy used in the extraction of fuels (the energy sector) and energy lost in transformation (the <b>transformation</b> <b>sector,</b> i.e. converting heat to electricity in power plants or fuel energy to heat in heating plants) as well as gross final energy consumption for end users. In 2013 Denmark’s total final energy consumption was 607 PJ whilst its primary energy consumption was 763 PJ. Most of the approximately 25% difference is accounted for in losses in the <b>transformation</b> <b>sector.</b> These losses {{are likely to be}} most prevalent in thermal electricity sectors, thus the use of renewable electricity will reduce CO2 emissions and fuels lost in the energy and transformation sectors as well as those in final consumption.

Under the European Union Energy Efficiency Directive, EU countries submit their Energy Efficiency Plans every three years. According to Italy’s submission in 2014 the country’s total final energy consumption in 2012 was 119.01 Mtoes whilst its primary energy consumption was 163.05 Mtoes.

By using more efficient thermal generation the potential remains to reduce energy waste by around a third and to cut CO2 emissions accordingly.|$|E

30|$|The {{production}} sectors were {{assumed to}} maximize profits under multi-nested constant elasticity substitution (CES) functions and at each input price. Energy <b>transformation</b> <b>sectors</b> input energy and value-added as a fixed coefficient, whereas energy end-use sectors have elasticities between energy and value-added. They were treated {{in this manner}} to deal appropriately with energy conversion efficiency in the energy <b>transformation</b> <b>sectors.</b> Power generated from several energy sources was combined by a logit function, although a CES function is often used in other CGE models. We chose this method for the consideration of the energy balance because the CES function does not guarantee a material balance (Schumacher and Sands 2006). Household expenditure on each commodity was described by a linear expenditure system (LES) function. The saving ratio was endogenously determined to balance saving and investment, and capital formation for each item was determined using a fixed coefficient. The Armington assumption was used for trade, and the current account {{was assumed to be}} balanced.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAnalysis of the {{function}} of urban energy metabolic system is an important research subject under the policy of energy saving. We developed an ecological network model for the system, and used Beijing city {{as an example of}} how this approach provides insights into the flows within the system. The basic components of the model are energy exploitation, energy transformation, energy consumption, and energy recovery. Beijing's energy metabolic system in 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2007 were analyzed by this approach as examples. Network utility analysis was applied to analyze the complex relationships between the components within the system. Using the sign distribution in the network utility matrix, we determined the relationships between each pair of the system's components. Some of the energy metabolic relationships between sectors were the same in the four years, whereas others were different. The ecological relationships between the energy <b>transformation</b> and exploitation <b>sectors,</b> between the energy consumption and <b>transformation</b> <b>sectors,</b> and between the energy consumption and exploitation sectors were the same, but the ecological relationships between the energy recovery and other three sectors differed greatly.

Provided the respective institutions back the proposed method, then Bulgaria would be a forerunner for collecting and processing data on transaction cost in an economy. ...|$|E
