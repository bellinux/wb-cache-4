Among the colonists of New France, Canadiens extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present-day Maritimes, while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed <b>to</b> <b>Louisiana.</b> The Beaver Wars {{broke out in the}} mid-17th century over control of the North American fur trade.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Andrew Jackson's plea for volunteers {{to fight the}} British in the War of 1812, James and Rezin enlisted in the Louisiana militia in late 1814.

In June 1819, he joined the Long Expedition, an effort to liberate Texas from Spanish rule.
