[...] In the second season opener, [...] "Judgement", Wolfram & Hart lawyers Lindsey McDonald and Lilah Morgan question Darla about her past.

The dreams sap his strength. In [...] "Dear Boy", Angel is shocked to see Darla walking the streets. When he tells his partners, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce and Cordelia Chase, <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is starting to lose his sanity.

2500|$|... "Every time Prescott {{opens his}} mouth, it's like someone has flipped open {{his head and}} stuck in an egg whisk."

However Liz Davies wrote that on the Labour National Executive Committee Prescott [...] "spoke in clear, concise sentences and his point was always understandable.

2500|$|Stuttering {{could have}} a {{significant}} negative cognitive and affective impact on the person who stutters. [...] It has been {{described in terms of}} the analogy to an iceberg, with the immediately visible and audible symptoms of stuttering above the waterline and a broader set of symptoms such as negative emotions hidden below the surface. Feelings of embarrassment, shame, frustration, fear, anger, and guilt are frequent in people who stutter, and may actually increase tension and effort, leading to increased stuttering. With time, continued exposure to difficult speaking experiences may crystallize into a negative self-concept and self-image. Many perceive stutterers as less intelligent due to their disfluency; however, [...] as a group, individuals who stutter tend to be of above average intelligence. [...] A person who stutters may project his or her attitudes onto others, believing that <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> or she is nervous or stupid. Such negative feelings and attitudes may need to be a major focus of a treatment program.|$|E

2500|$|In 1883, Luther Standing Bear {{was sent}} to Philadelphia to work as an intern for John Wanamaker.

[...] While riding on street cars in Philadelphia, Luther did not care to listen to the vulgar language used by white boys on the way to work. At the end of his internship, the entire Carlisle school students and faculty traveled to a large meeting hall in Philadelphia where Pratt and Wanamaker spoke. Luther was asked to come to the stage, and Wanamaker told the students that Luther had been promoted from one department to another every month getting better work and better money and in spite of the fact that he employed over one thousand people, he never promoted anyone as rapidly as Luther.|$|E

They put him a few pegs down on the social ladder because of how they perceive someone who dresses differently. The lyrics express the sentiment that I much more easily identify with someone like Artis than I would watch him play.|$|R
