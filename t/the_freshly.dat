5|$|The aborted Apollo 13 {{mission was}} {{originally}} scheduled {{to land at}} Fra Mauro, with Apollo 14 scheduled to land in the Littrow region of Mare Serenitatis. After Apollo 13 failed to land, {{it was decided to}} re-target Apollo 14 to Fra Mauro, as it was regarded as more interesting scientifically than the Littrow site. There, Apollo 14 had the objective of sampling ejecta from the Imbrium impact to gain insight into the Moon's geologic history. A landing site near <b>the</b> <b>freshly</b> formed Cone crater was chosen, as this crater served as a 'natural drill hole' to allow the astronauts to obtain Imbrium ejecta, the primary objective of the mission.|$|E

To lighten her labors, she lubricates the area with her bladder water. Once the nest is complete, the female deposits into the hole. <b>The</b> <b>freshly</b> laid eggs are white, elliptical, porous, and flexible. From start to finish, the female's work may take fourhours. Sometimes she remains on land overnight afterwards, before returning to her home water.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} August, all of Bonanza Creek {{had been}} claimed by miners. A {{prospector}} then advanced up {{into one of the}} creeks feeding into Bonanza, later to be named Eldorado Creek. He discovered new sources of gold there, which would prove to be even richer than those on Bonanza. Claims began to be sold between miners and speculators for considerable sums. Just before Christmas, word of the gold reached Circle City. Despite the winter, many prospectors immediately left for the Yukon by dog-sled, eager to reach the region before the best claims were taken. The outside world was still largely unaware of the news and although Canadian officials had managed {{to send a message to}} their superiors in Ottawa about the finds and influx of prospectors, the government did not give it much attention. The winter prevented river traffic, and it was not until June 1897 that the first boats left the area, carrying <b>the</b> <b>freshly</b> mined gold and the full story of the discoveries.|$|E

5|$|While Rokossovsky's Central Front {{continued}} its offensive against the German Second Army, which had by now been substantially reinforced with fresh divisions, the renewed German offensive towards Kharkov took it by surprise. On 7 March, Manstein {{made the decision}} to press on towards Kharkov, despite the coming of the spring thaw. Instead of attacking east of Kharkov, however, Manstein decided to orient the attack towards the west of Kharkov and then encircle it from the north. The Großdeutschland Panzergrenadier Division had also returned to the front, and threw its weight into the attack, threatening to split the 69th Army and the remnants of the 3rd Tank Army. Between 8–9 March, the SS Panzer Corps completed its drive north, splitting the 69th and 40th Soviet Armies, and on 9 March it turned east to complete its encirclement. Despite attempts by the Stavka to curtail the German advance by throwing in <b>the</b> <b>freshly</b> released 19th Rifle Division and 186th Tank Brigade, the German drive continued.|$|E
5|$|The Ostsack (east sack) of the Krivasoo bridgehead, {{defended by}} the Soviet 6th and the 117th Rifle Corps, were {{confused}} by the Strachwitz Battle Group's diversionary attack on 6 April. The attack deceived the Soviet forces into thinking that the German attack intended to cut them out from the west flank. The actual assault came directly at the 59th Army and started with a heavy bombardment. The positions of the 59th Army were attacked by dive bombers and the forest there was set afire. At the same time, the 61st Infantry Division and the Strachwitz tank squadron pierced deep into the 59th Army's defences, splitting the two rifle corps apart and forcing them to retreat to their fortifications. Marshal of the Soviet Union Leonid Govorov was outraged by the news, sending in <b>the</b> <b>freshly</b> re-deployed 8th Army. Their attempt {{to cut off the}} Tiger I tanks was repelled by Lieutenant Günther Famula, who received a posthumous Knight's Cross for these actions, keeping their supply lines open. On 7 April, Govorov ordered his troops to switch on to the defensive. The 59th Army, having lost another 5,700 troops from all causes, was withdrawn from the bridgehead. For these successes Strachwitz received the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds on 15 April 1944. News of the award had reached his headquarters on the early morning of 15 April via teleprinter message. The official presentation was made a few weeks later by Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{influence}} of the collapsing of the Eastern Bloc, on 10 November 1989 the Communist Party gave up its political monopoly, Zhivkov resigned, and Bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy. The first free elections in June 1990 were won by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP, <b>the</b> <b>freshly</b> renamed Communist Party). A new constitution that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in July 1991. The new system initially failed to improve living standards or create economic growth—the average quality of life and economic performance remained lower than under communism well into the early 2000s. A 1997 reform package restored economic growth, but living standards continued to suffer. After 2001 economic, political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly, and Bulgaria achieved high Human Development status. It became a member of NATO in 2004 and participated in the War in Afghanistan. After several years of reforms it joined the European Union in 2007 despite continued concerns about government corruption.|$|E
