Additional aspects of training address aerobic (low-intensity) exercise—especially for endurance—and strength to improve joint flexibility and {{to minimize the}} risk of injury. Cross-country ski training occurs throughout the year, including on dry land where athletes engage in roller skiing and ski striding to maintain ski-specific muscle fitness.|$|E
5|$|Both of <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> airfields {{contained}} {{sector operations}} rooms {{from which the}} British fighters were directed into action. These airfields were selected by the Luftwaffe {{because they were the}} largest ones known to be operating RAF fighters. The German intelligence had no knowledge of the sector operations rooms there. The rooms were above ground and had little protection. If these buildings were to be hit, it would be a serious blow to the control system in the region.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1980s, more {{resistance}} movements {{supported by}} Ethiopia's communist Derg administration had sprung {{up across the}} country. Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerillas, especially in the northern regions. The clampdown included bombing of cities, with the northwestern administrative center of Hargeisa, a Somali National Movement (SNM) stronghold, among <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> areas in 1988.|$|E
30|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>target</b> {{detection}} probability drop, {{targets are}} sometimes localized and sometimes not. Depending {{on the length}} of the continuous time interval within which <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is localized, <b>the</b> MTT will create and maintain <b>the</b> <b>target</b> tracks. If <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is localized rarely, then <b>the</b> <b>target</b> tracks will not be created or will disappear.|$|R
5000|$|For moving <b>targets,</b> <b>the</b> point-of-aim {{is ahead}} of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> in <b>the</b> {{direction}} of movement.

30|$|To sum up, the {{infrared}} radiation of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is very complex, which {{is because the}} factors affecting {{the infrared}} radiation of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> are multifaceted, including the radiation of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> surface, <b>the</b> absorption and reflectivity of <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> <b>the</b> climate conditions, the selective absorption and scattering of the atmosphere, the atmospheric scintillation, the velocity of <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> <b>the</b> surface coating and heat insulation, {{the noise of the}} circuit, and so on.|$|R
5|$|Commercially, the {{radioactive}} isotope bismuth-213 {{can be produced}} by bombarding radium with bremsstrahlung photons from a linear particle accelerator. In 1997, an antibody conjugate with bismuth-213, which has a 45-minute half-life and decays with the emission of an alpha particle, was used to treat patients with leukemia. This isotope has also been tried in cancer treatment, for example, in <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> alpha therapy (TAT) program.|$|E
5|$|Ellet's men {{returned}} to De Soto Point and constructed an artillery battery targeting an iron foundry recasting spent Union artillery shells.

30|$|However, frames {{occasionally}} {{occurred in}} which no target was identified despite <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> presence, 92 % (55 frames) of which were caused by occlusion. Due to estimation errors regarding <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> position, in 23 frames, dis-identification occurred after occlusion. In each frame, <b>the</b> <b>target</b> was regarded not as <b>the</b> <b>target</b> but as <b>the</b> other candidate, and associated across frames. It is impossible to estimate <b>the</b> <b>target</b> position correctly during long-term occlusion. Therefore, a recovery method is required that will help with re-identification whenever <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is lost.|$|R
5|$|In September 2010, in {{retaliation}} against the Bollywood film industry's hiring of Aiplex Software to launch cyberattacks against The Pirate Bay, Anonymous members, recruited through posts on 4chan boards, subsequently initiated their own attacks, dubbed Operation Payback, targeting the website of the Motion Picture Association of America and the Recording Industry Association of America. <b>The</b> <b>targeted</b> websites usually went offline {{for a short}} period of time due to the attacks, before recovering.|$|E
5|$|Low, {{like other}} pirates of the time, tried to intimidate his victims into {{surrendering}} {{by threatening to}} kill or torture them. The crew of <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> ship would hinder the officers from defending the ship, so afraid were they of reprisals. One failed torture session led to one of Low's crew members accidentally cutting him in the mouth. Botched surgery left Low scarred.|$|E

They are most commonly used as antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNA, primers for DNA sequencing and amplification, probes for detecting complementary DNA or RNA via molecular hybridization, tools for <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> introduction of mutations and restriction sites, and for the synthesis of artificial genes.|$|E
30|$|In this work, the {{detection}} performance of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> echo from CW ping signals is enhanced {{in the presence}} of reverberations. To this end, a reverberation suppression algorithm is proposed based on NMF and distinguishing characteristics between <b>the</b> <b>target</b> echo and reverberations. Specifically, three characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> are considered: <b>the</b> frequency structure of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> echo {{is similar to that of}} the Doppler-shifted transmitted signal, <b>the</b> <b>target</b> echo has time-continuous values, and <b>the</b> <b>target</b> echo has relatively short and finite duration. To use these characteristics, the frequency bases of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> echo are fixed by frequency-shifted transmitted pings, and constraints on the temporal continuity and TLL are developed.|$|R
30|$|Based on the distance/angle {{from the}} mobile camera to <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> <b>the</b> {{latitude}} and longitude of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> can be obtained. Finally, the trajectories of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> are smoothed by Kalman filtering (KF).|$|R
30|$|Taking {{into account}} <b>the</b> actual <b>target</b> in <b>the</b> {{short-time}} flight process, <b>the</b> <b>target</b> flight path {{will not have}} large sudden changes. This article uses the parabolic least square method formula to predict <b>the</b> <b>target</b> spatial position, which can effectively improve the robustness {{of the system and}} make <b>the</b> <b>target</b> lost. For a certain period of time, the device can still follow the correct trajectory to ensure that the system can still track <b>the</b> <b>target</b> correctly when <b>the</b> <b>target</b> reappears.|$|R
5|$|The encounter: Once {{the prey}} detects the wolves, it can either {{approach}} the wolves, stand its ground, or flee. Large prey, such as moose, elk, and muskoxen, usually stand their ground. Should this occur, the wolves hold back, as they require the stimulus of a running animal {{to proceed with}} an attack. If <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> animal stands its ground, the wolves either ignore it, or try to intimidate it into running.|$|E
5|$|After {{founding}} PT Bina Media Tenggara to {{back the}} paper, Wanandi spent several months contacting influential figures at <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> newspapers. To receive their cooperation, Kompas requested a 25 percent share in the new newspaper, for which it would handle the daily business operations, such as printing, circulation, and advertising. Tempo offered to assist with management {{in return for a}} 15 percent share, while Sabam Siagian of Sinar Harapan was hired as the first chief editor, for which Sinar Harapan received stock. The establishment of the paper was further aided by incoming Information Minister Harmoko, who received 5 percent interest for his role in acquiring a license. In total, the start-up cost Rp. 500 million (US$700,000 at the time). Muhammad Chudori, a co-founder of The Jakarta Post who formerly reported for Antara, became the newspaper's first general manager.|$|E
5|$|After {{these initial}} {{observations}} in plants, laboratories searched for this phenomenon in other organisms. Craig C. Mello and Andrew Fire's 1998 Nature paper reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into C. elegans. In investigating {{the regulation of}} muscle protein production, they observed that neither mRNA nor antisense RNA injections {{had an effect on}} protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> gene. As a result of this work, they coined the term RNAi. This discovery represented the first identification of the causative agent for the phenomenon. Fire and Mello were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.|$|E
30|$|The {{first step}} is to obtain the {{specific}} motion equation of <b>the</b> moving <b>targets</b> after selected. Because of the continuous relative movement of the UAV and <b>the</b> <b>targets,</b> coordinates of <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> will constantly change and need to be updated in real time. In order to obtain the motion equation of <b>the</b> moving <b>targets,</b> <b>the</b> positions of <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> are obtained by radar in this paper, and the interception, tracking, track calculation, and tracking state determination of <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> are completed by radar data processing. In radar data processing, the motion trajectory of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is established through correlation and filtering processing, which effectively eliminates false detection caused by residual clutter and updates <b>the</b> <b>target</b> position.|$|R
50|$|The collimator's distant {{virtual image}} of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> subtends a certain angle, {{referred}} to as the angular extent of <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> that depends on the collimator focal length and <b>the</b> <b>target</b> size. Assuming <b>the</b> sensed image includes <b>the</b> whole <b>target,</b> <b>the</b> angle seen by the camera, its FOV, is this angular extent of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> times <b>the</b> ratio of full image size to target image size.|$|R
30|$|Figure  7 {{shows that}} by {{predicting}} <b>the</b> <b>target</b> position {{according to the}} state of <b>the</b> observed <b>target</b> by radar, <b>the</b> experimental UAV makes a judgment on <b>the</b> <b>target</b> motion direction and corrects the direction in advance, thereby reducing the path length required to reach <b>the</b> <b>target</b> and shortening <b>the</b> time required to get close to <b>the</b> <b>target.</b> <b>The</b> tracking efficiency is improved and the path planning is optimized.|$|R
5|$|However, the toad was {{generally}} unsuccessful in reducing <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> grey-backed cane beetles (Dermolepida albohirtum), {{in part because}} the cane fields provided insufficient shelter for the predators during the day, {{in part because the}} beetles live at the tops of sugar cane – and cane toads are not good climbers. Since its original introduction, the cane toad has had a particularly marked effect on Australian biodiversity. The population of a number of native predatory reptiles has declined, such as the varanid lizards Varanus mertensi, V. mitchelli, and V. panoptes, the land snakes Pseudechis australis and Acanthophis antarcticus, and the crocodile species Crocodylus johnstoni; in contrast, the population of the agamid lizard Amphibolurus gilbertiknown to be a prey item of V. panopteshas increased.|$|E
5|$|In Taiwan, where Morakot {{first made}} landfall, heavy {{rainfall}} resulted in flooding. Commercial flights, schools, and rail service {{in some areas}} was cancelled {{in advance of the}} storm. Precipitation there peaked at 653mm (25.71in) over a period of nearly two days in Taitung County. Crop damage also resulted from the rainfall, and was estimated at over NT$70million (US$2million). In China, record rainfall was reported. The worst impacted city was Quanzhou, where losses due to Morakot reached CN¥240million (US$29million) and one death was reported. Power outages were also widespread across southeastern China. Due to preexisting drought conditions, 703cloud seeding operations took place in order to artificially generate added rainfall; such operations resulted in moderate precipitation over <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> area. Overall, Morakot caused roughly $31million in damage and three deaths.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mating}} season, rutting males move about {{in search of}} females in oestrus. Males become {{aggressive}} and fight among themselves for dominance. These fights are characterised by displays of the enlarged chest, the throat patch and the beard while holding the head upright; and threatening the opponent by running with the horns pointed toward him and circling him. The victorious bull would protect the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> female from other males. The courtship typically lasts for 45 minutes. The male, stiff and composed, approaches the receptive female, who keeps her head {{low to the ground}} and may slowly walk forward. The male licks her genitalia, upon which the female holds her tail to a side and the male gives out a flehmen response. Finally, the male pushes his chest against her rump, and mounts her.|$|E

5|$|Loss {{of habitat}} {{is the other}} major threat to the corn crake, since drained and fertilised silage fields are less {{suitable}} for breeding than traditional hay meadows. In western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable land has been aided by subsidies, and further east the collapse of collective farming {{has led to the}} abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area. More localised threats include floods in spring, and disturbance by roads or wind farms, and the loss of many birds – up to 14,000 a year – in Egypt, where migrating birds are captured in nets set for the quail with which they often migrate. Although this may account for 0.5–2.7% of the European population, the losses to this form of hunting are less than when <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> species were more numerous and predictable.|$|E

At about 09:32 UT {{on the day of}} docking, the crew prepared to open the hatches between the Soyuz spacecraft and the station. After entering the station the crew stabilized the atmosphere inside Mir and undertook routine maintenance work.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{government}} {{was concerned about}} the results of the March firebombing attacks as the raids had demonstrated that the Japanese military was unable to protect the nation's airspace. As well as the extensive physical damage in <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> cities, the attacks also caused increased absenteeism as civilians were afraid to leave their homes to work in factories which might be bombed. Japanese air defenses were reinforced in response to the firebombing raids, but remained inadequate; 450 fighters were assigned to defensive duties in April.|$|E
50|$|Since {{shotguns}} {{are generally}} used for shooting at small, fast moving targets, {{it is important}} to lead <b>the</b> <b>target</b> by firing slightly ahead of <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> so that when the shot reaches the range of <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> will have moved into the pattern. On uphill shooting, this means to shoot above <b>the</b> <b>target.</b> Conversely, on downhill shooting, this means to shoot below <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> which is somewhat counterintuitive for many beginning hunters. Of course, depending on the barrel length, the amount of lead employed will vary for different barrel lengths, and must be learned by experience.|$|R
