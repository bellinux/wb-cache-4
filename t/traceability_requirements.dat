40|$|Context: In recent times, many {{organizations}} have started using agile software development methodologies {{instead of using}} traditional methodologies. The main reason for this shift {{is the ability of}} agile approaches to cope with changes in the requirements, customer satisfaction and assurance of on-time delivery of quality products [19]. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology that is considered {{to be one of the}} most prominent practices of eXtreme Programming (XP) (an agile methodology) [1][9][10]. Test-list in TDD is considered as a temporary repository in which test items are stored and later by using those items test cases are developed. <b>Requirements</b> <b>Traceability</b> is also a major problem in agile development mainly because of lack of formal requirements specification and frequent requirements change. Objectives: This study explores the utilization of test-list and possibility of using test-list for <b>requirements</b> <b>traceability</b> in TDD. This study describes concept of test-list, its formation and exploring its utilization in TDD. Methods for implementing <b>requirements</b> <b>traceability</b> in and identification of possibility of utilizing test-list for <b>requirements</b> <b>traceability</b> in TDD is also explored. Methods: Methods used in this study are systematic literature review, surveys and interviews. Systematic literature review was done using seven electronic databases, including Inspec, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Springer, Science Direct and Scopus. Studies were selected on the bases of preliminary, basic and advanced developed criteria. Survey was conducted using online questionnaire from TDD practitioners. Findings from literature review and surveys were used to develop interview questionnaires. Interviews were conducted from the same practitioners that were involved in surveys. Results: Based on the findings of literature review, questionnaire and interviews, we obtained TDD practices for test-list development and <b>requirements</b> <b>traceability.</b> Analysis was performed on results of SLR and questionnaire and possibility of using test-list for <b>requirements</b> <b>traceability</b> was identified. Based on the analysis of literature review and surveys, interview questionnaire were developed to further investigate the area of interest. We have found that in literature there is no defined method to develop test-list. and survey participants also confirms it. Majority of survey participants create test-list temporarily and informal. On question of whether test-list can be use for <b>requirements</b> <b>traceability</b> around 70 % of participants are agree for its use. Interview respondents also confirm the findings of survey. Conclusions: Literature has not provided any test-list development method and practitioners also have no clear guideline to develop test-list prior to Test development. Systematic literature review and practitioner’s survey and interviews confirm it. Literature is also silent for any specific requirements change management or <b>requirements</b> <b>traceability</b> method in TDD.
