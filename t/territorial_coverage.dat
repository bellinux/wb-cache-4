40|$|Objective. Fish species {{community}} {{structure and}} benthic organisms coverage were studied in five localities in Santa Marta where the lionfish is present. Materials and methods. Abundance of fish species, including lion fish, was established using 30 m random visual censuses and video transects; trophic guilds were established according to available references. On {{the other hand}} benthic coverage was evaluated using the software Coral Point Count (CPCe) 4. 0. Results. Families with higher species numbers were Serranidae, Labridae, and Pomacentridae. Lionfish abundances were low (2. 6 ± 2. 1 ind/ 120 m 2), {{but in any case}} Pterois volitans was observed as the eleventh more abundant species, surpassing species of commercial value such as Cephalopholis cruentata. Species that were found in larger numbers (> 100, Thalassoma bifasciatum, Haemulon aurolineatum, Canthigaster rostrata, Abudefduf saxatilis, Chromis cyanea, and Stegastes partitus) were mainly invertebrate eaters, planctivores, and <b>territorial</b> herbivores. Coral <b>coverage</b> showed higher coral percentages in Chengue (69. 9 %) and Cinto (27. 4 %), larger sponge percentages in Morro (32. 7 %); Isla Aguja and Remanso showed the larger figures for abiotic substrate (41. 6 and 37 %, respectively); corals, sponges, and gorgonians were the components best explaining fish community, but not for the lion fish, which inhabit all studied reef formations. Conclusions. Lion fish is ranked between the 20 more abundant species, with none commercially important species larger, hence no species may qualify as a natural control.

5000|$|... also vasconia, baskonia, Baskonia, Wasconia, also plural Vasconiae, Vasconias, {{and part}} of the {{etymology}} of Gascony. In Latin Basque Land. The term emerged in Roman times and until medieval era it was occasionally used in Latin documents and maps, usually with ambiguous geographical rather than political denotation. Rarely used in Spanish; when used in plural it referred to 2 parts (“ambas Vasconias”, “dos Vasconias”): the Spanish and the French one. It enjoyed modest revival in the late 19th century, used generally against a cultural, historical and regional background; it appeared mostly in literary or scientific Vascólogist discourse. The term underlined commonality of Basque area but was deprived of political notions; it tended to put common history on the forefront. It lacked clear geographical meaning and was applied according to perceived <b>territorial</b> <b>coverage</b> of the Basque realm. Following demise in the early 20th century, “Vasconia” enjoyed some revival during Francoism; unlike politically-charged “país vasco” or “provincias vascas”, censorship tolerated it easily as a historical, semi-scientific reference. Following brief confusion among the nationalists in the mid-1960s, currently it is out of use except for historical discourse (or names of institutions, sporting associations etc.).|$|E
5000|$|... also Euskalerria, Euskal-Erria, Euskal Erria, Euskal-Herria, Euskal Herria, Euskeria, always capitalized. In Basque {{literally}} Basque realm. The term traditionally in use {{in different}} Basque spoken dialects, it was first used in writing (in alavese Basque dialect) in the 16th century and enjoyed renaissance with growing number of Basque prints since the 1880s, filtering into Spanish and used usually as macaronic intercalation. Originally it could have referred to a territory, a population, a cultural commonality or all these components together. Most commonly it simply denoted a Basque realm, understood as a conglomerate of historical, regional, ethnic, cultural and religious ingredients. Originally it was entirely deprived of political flavor; in the late 19th century it was briefly adopted by emerging Basque nationalists (to denote a Basque land), who later abandoned it {{for the sake of}} “Euzkadi”. In the early 20th century “Euskalerria” adopted a conservative political taste (with some tension between “Euskalerria” and “Euzkadi”), entirely lost during Francoism. In the later 20th century the term was re-adopted by the nationalists; since 1979 “Euskal Herria” is one of two official Basque names of the automous community consisting of Biscay, Gipuzkoa and Álava. Geographical application was and is (except official use) ambiguous depending on perceived <b>territorial</b> <b>coverage</b> of the Basque realm; it could include Labourd, Lower Navarre and Soule or even territories in Argentina and Uruguay.|$|E

40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the evolution}} of Ecuadorian political parties’ <b>territorial</b> <b>coverage</b> since the return to democracy.

Through use of electoral cartography, as well as mixed model statistical analysis, the results show a high level of volatility along both dimensions of nationalization for all parties, including the government’s ALianza pais. The analysis also reveals that widespread voter support for legislators from a single party is driven by presidential coattails rather than through developing deep roots in districts. The geographical analysis indicates that regionalism has persisted in Ecuadorian political parties since 1979 despite the success of Rafael Correa’s party at the polls...|$|E

In rural areas of Africa, access to water is as much constrained by <b>territorial</b> <b>coverage</b> as it is by the poor conditions of water points due to the difficulty in mobilizing communities for repairs. This paper examines the equity considerations of a rural water and sanitation programme in a district of Mozambique, and their impacts on the achievement of the programme's objectives. Our analysis underlines the contradictions in the conceptualization of equity in the design, planning and implementation of the programme. Even an explicitly pro-poor strategy can fall short of delivering equity. Our findings stress the fact that overlooking local perception of equity can have a direct impact on the ability of a community to ensure the maintenance of their water points. They call for a careful definition of equity in the design of water programmes, as well as closer attention to this criterion as a precondition to achieving the long-term objective of the programme.
