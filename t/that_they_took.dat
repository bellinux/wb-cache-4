5|$|San Martín did {{not mention}} Escalada in his first battle report, leading initial historians to infer that they stayed within the convent during the battle. However it is {{currently}} considered <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> part in the battle, {{as suggested by the}} royalist battle report and a later report from San Martin which clarifies that only twelve grenadiers stayed in the convent.|$|E
5|$|This last {{task was}} {{particularly}} unpopular with American prospectors, who faced paying {{an average of}} 25 percent {{of the value of}} their goods and supplies. The Mounties had a reputation for running these posts honestly, although accusations were made <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> bribes. Prospectors, on the other hand, tried to smuggle prize items like silk and whiskey across the pass in tins and bales of hay: the former item for the ladies, the latter for the saloons.|$|E

5|$|By {{becoming}} chef de canton, Houphouët assumed {{responsibility for}} the administration of Akouè, a canton which comprised 36 villages. He also {{took charge of the}} family plantation—at the time {{one of the most important}} in the country—and worked to diversify its rubber, cocoa and coffee crops. He soon became one of Africa's richest farmers. On 3 September 1944, he established, in cooperation with the colonial administration, the African Agricultural Union (Syndicat agricole africain, SAA). Under his presidency, the SAA brought together African farmers who were dissatisfied with their working conditions and worked to protect their interests against those of European planters. Anti-colonialist and anti-racist, the organisation demanded better working conditions, higher wages, and the abolition of unfree labor. The union quickly received the support of nearly 20,000 plantation workers, together with that of the left-wing French administrators placed in office by the Provisional Government. Its success irritated colonists to the extent <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> legal action against Houphouët, accusing him of being anti-French for never seeking French citizenship. However, Houphouët befriended the Inspector Minister of the Colonies, who ordered the charges dropped. They were more successful in obtaining the replacement of the sympathetic Governor André Latrille with the hostile Governor Henry de Mauduit.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 2007, a Class 73 derailed {{after hitting}} an {{avalanche}} between Hallingskeid and Myrdal on the Bergen Line. The accident {{raised questions about}} the class's abilities to handle hard snow, such as in avalanches. In particular, a DNV report from 1999 had shown that the train could act as a sled, lose contact with the tracks and slide on top of the snow. A former NSB employee who worked with route planning, stated that a locomotive-hauled train would be better suitable for such situations, because more of the weight is located {{at the front of the}} train, and it will therefore plow instead of slide. The National Rail Administration said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> extra precautions for the Class 73 trains and that during snowfall they would run a snow-clearing unit ahead of all Class 73 runs. NSB stated that they would consider the possibility of reverting to conventional trains, but that unless new information could shed light on the situation, they would retain use of the Class 73 trains.|$|E

Before this, they would operate additional sailings on Sundays if several previous sailings have been cancelled, to allow the backlog of traffic to clear.

25|$|One of {{the people}} who had backed Edwards' Glamorgan {{campaign}} was the barrister, William Vaughan of 'Glanelai', (Lanelay), Pontyclun, near Cardiff, after whom Nash Vaughan Edwards (1811-1868) had been named. When Mr Vaughan died in 1829, he left father and son his estate, on condition <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> on the Vaughan surname. Thus they became John Edwards-Vaughan and Nash Vaughan Edwards-Vaughan, and acquired properties at Lanelay and at Clase, Llangyfelach, near Swansea.|$|E

25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{noted that}} the North Central crew {{would have had to}} look toward the sun to see the {{approaching}} Air Wisconsin plane and concluded <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> no evasive action. Some eyewitnesses believed that the Air Wisconsin Twin Otter began a turn seconds before the collision, but the NTSB did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that the Air Wisconsin crew took evasive action. The rate of closure during the final five seconds before the collision was 688 feet (210 m) per second, i.e., 469mph (755km/hr).|$|E

25|$|Hybodonts have a {{wide variety}} of tooth shapes. This variety {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> advantage of multiple food sources. It is thought that some hybodonts which had wider, flatter, teeth specialized in crushing hard-shelled prey. Well-developed wear facets on teeth from Lissodus suggest that some hybodontiforms crushed their food. Species described from Thailand have a range of teeth shapes, suggesting multiple feeding habits. Bulbous teeth were used for crushing hard shelled bottom-dwelling prey. Others were opportunistic feeders and were species that had a diet of large soft-bodied prey.|$|E
25|$|Mara {{said that}} he was shocked to learn that the Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit of the Army had been {{involved}} in the coup.

Mara also declared that the Counter Revolutionary Warfare officers who joined Speight's coup had trained on a farm owned by Rabuka. Excerpts of this interview were broadcast on 29 April 2001; the full interview was not broadcast until 29 April 2004 – while his body was lying in state in preparation for his funeral.|$|E
25|$|The Confederates {{initially}} reported {{casualties in}} the affair of one dead (Captain Marr), four (later reduced to two) wounded (including Lt. Col. Ewell) and one missing. A later Confederate account states that only two were wounded, but five were captured, which is {{in accord with the}} Union account which states five prisoners were taken and actually names them. The Union force reported one killed, four wounded (including Lt. Tompkins) and one missing. The Union soldier killed was identified as Private Saintclair. The Confederates stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> three prisoners and recent accounts agree. The Union force also had lost 9 horses killed and 4 wounded.|$|E

25|$|Many rabbis {{believe that}} God {{completed}} {{the creation of}} the world close to 6,000 years ago. This view is based on a chronology developed in a midrash, Seder Olam, which was based on a literal reading of the Book of Genesis. It is attributed to the Tanna Yose ben Halafta, and covers history from {{the creation of the}} universe to the construction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. Since there is no explicit discussion in the classical era, it is commonly presumed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> Genesis 1 literally, making the beginning of the world six days earlier, but this is presumption in the absence of data.|$|E
25|$|The {{percentage}} of adults using a prescription sleep aid increases with age.

Rates of use were lowest among the youngest age group (those aged 20–39) at about 2%, increased to 6% among those aged 50–59, and reached 7% among those aged 80 and over. More adult women (5.0%) reported using prescription sleep aids than adult men (3.1%). Non-Hispanic white adults reported higher use of sleep aids (4.7%) than non-Hispanic black (2.5%) and Mexican-American (2.0%) adults. No difference was shown between non-Hispanic black adults and Mexican-American adults in use of prescription sleep aids.|$|E
25|$|Later on in {{the history}} of the Dutch East Indies, as a new wave of Europeans were brought into the colony, many adopted the Indonesian styles, many even went so far as to wear {{traditional}} Javanese kebaya at home. Batik was also a big influence for the Dutch. The technique was so fascinating to them <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> the technique to their colonies in Africa where it was adopted with African patterns. For the most part, Europeans in the Dutch East Indies, stuck to traditional European styles of dressing. Fashion trends from Paris were still highly regarded and considered the epitome of style.
