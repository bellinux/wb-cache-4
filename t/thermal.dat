50|$|When the air {{has little}} {{moisture}} or when an inversion stops {{the warm air}} from rising high enough for the moisture to condense, <b>thermals</b> do not create cumulus clouds. Typical locations to find <b>thermals</b> are over towns, freshly ploughed fields and asphalt roads, but <b>thermals</b> are often hard to associate with any feature on the ground. Occasionally <b>thermals</b> are caused by the exhaust gases from power stations or by fires.|$|R
5000|$|Harris {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} the first <b>Thermals</b> record, More Parts per Million, {{in the kitchen}} of his one-bedroom house in Southeast Portland in early 2002. Sub Pop Records heard the recording via Ben Gibbard of Death Cab For Cutie and The Postal Service, and signed The <b>Thermals</b> to a three-record contract when the band was less than six months old. [...] The original live line-up of The <b>Thermals</b> consisted of Kathy Foster on bass, Jordan Hudson on drums, Ben Barnett on guitar, and Harris on lead vocals. Barnett departed The <b>Thermals</b> soon after More Parts per Million was released, and The <b>Thermals</b> became a three-piece. The current line-up of The <b>Thermals</b> is Hutch Harris on guitar and vocals, Kathy Foster on bass, and Westin Glass on drums.|$|R
5000|$|The {{benefits}} {{depend on}} three factors: the aerodynamic {{performance of the}} type of glider at various speeds and weights, the strength of the <b>thermals</b> on the day and the width of the <b>thermals</b> on the day. The increased sink rate will have a small percentage effect on the climb rate in strong <b>thermals.</b> The extra weight of ballast requires the pilot to bank more to stay in narrow <b>thermals</b> and this also increases the sink rate.|$|R
5|$|Argon is {{used for}} <b>thermal</b> {{insulation}} in energy-efficient windows. Argon is also used in technical scuba diving to inflate a dry suit because it is inert and has low <b>thermal</b> conductivity.|$|E
5|$|As of 2015, 1,464MW of {{the total}} <b>thermal</b> {{installed}} capacity was from state-owned fossil fuel power stations: 900MW from Lakvijaya, 380MW from the state-owned portion of Kelanitissa, 160MW from Sapugaskanda, and 24MW from Uthuru Janani. The remaining 641MW of the installed <b>thermal</b> capacity are from six privately owned power stations. All <b>thermal</b> power stations run on fuel oil, except Lakvijaya, which run on coal.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{excellent}} <b>thermal</b> {{and chemical}} stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. bearings and in steelmaking. Plastics filled with BN have less <b>thermal</b> expansion as well as higher <b>thermal</b> conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and <b>thermal</b> properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows and as a structural material for seals. It {{can also be used}} as dielectric in resistive random access memories.|$|E

5|$|Diamond's high <b>thermal</b> {{conductivity}} {{is used by}} jewelers and gemologists who may employ {{an electronic}} <b>thermal</b> probe to distinguish diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist {{of a pair of}} battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's <b>thermal</b> energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds. However, older probes will be fooled by moissanite, a crystalline mineral form of silicon carbide introduced in 1998 as an alternative to diamonds, which has a similar <b>thermal</b> conductivity.|$|E
5|$|Glass fibers {{are useful}} <b>thermal</b> {{insulators}} {{because of their}} high ratio of surface area to weight. However, the increased surface area makes them much more susceptible to chemical attack. By trapping air within them, blocks of glass fiber make good <b>thermal</b> insulation, with a <b>thermal</b> conductivity {{of the order of}} 0.05 W/(m·K).|$|E
5|$|Metals make {{relatively}} good conductors of heat, primarily because the delocalized electrons {{are free to}} transport <b>thermal</b> energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical conductivity, the <b>thermal</b> conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann–Franz law, which states that the ratio of <b>thermal</b> conductivity to the electrical conductivity {{is proportional to the}} temperature. The <b>thermal</b> disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical resistivity of the material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Thermals</b> {{begin as}} bubbles of rising air that are formed {{on the ground}} through the warming of the surface by sunlight.

50|$|Wolf Hirth {{was one of}} {{the first}} pilots to {{understand}} the glider characteristics necessary for cross-country flying on days with separated, strong <b>thermals.</b> It had to be equipped with a ballast tank to fly fast between <b>thermals</b> and be stable and efficient in the continuous, lift-gaining circling within the <b>thermals,</b> calling for high-aspect ratio wings with dihedral. He commissioned Edmund Schneider to build a one-off example, to be designed by Friedrich Wenk.|$|R
5|$|The {{theoretical}} <b>thermal</b> conductivity of hexagonal Boron nitride nanoribbons (BNNRs) {{can approach}} 1700–2000 W/(m·K), {{which has the}} same order of magnitude as the experimental measured value for graphene, and can be comparable to the theoretical calculations for graphene nanoribbons. Moreover, the <b>thermal</b> transport in the BNNRs is anisotropic. The <b>thermal</b> conductivity of zigzag-edged BNNRs is about 20% larger than that of armchair-edged nanoribbons at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thermal</b> {{analysis}} {{was the first}} done for any casting process. This was done by creating an electrical analog of the <b>thermal</b> system. A cross-section of the dies were drawn on Teledeltos paper and then <b>thermal</b> loads and cooling patterns were drawn onto the paper. Water lines were represented by magnets of various sizes. The <b>thermal</b> conductivity was represented by the reciprocal of the resistivity of the paper.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} types of glass, and it is most common to weld using the same types. Different glasses often have {{different}} rates of <b>thermal</b> expansion, which can cause them to crack upon cooling when they contract differently. For instance, quartz has very low <b>thermal</b> expansion, while soda-lime glass has very high <b>thermal</b> expansion. When welding different glasses to each other, it is usually important to closely match their coefficients of <b>thermal</b> expansion, to ensure that cracking does not occur. Also, some glasses will simply not mix with others, so welding between certain types may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|As it {{requires}} rising heated air, <b>thermalling</b> {{is most effective}} in mid-latitudes from spring through late summer. During winter the sun's heat can only create weak <b>thermals,</b> but ridge and wave lift can still be used during this period.|$|R

50|$|Potential <b>thermals</b> can be {{identified}} by land features that typically generate <b>thermals</b> or by cumulus clouds, which mark {{the top of a}} rising column of warm, humid air as it reaches the dew point and condenses to form a cloud.|$|R
5|$|<b>Thermal</b> mass is any {{material}} {{that can be}} used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common <b>thermal</b> mass materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of <b>thermal</b> mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, <b>thermal</b> mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment.|$|E
25|$|In physics, <b>thermal</b> contact {{conductance}} is {{the study}} of heat conduction between solid bodies in <b>thermal</b> contact. The <b>thermal</b> contact conductance coefficient, , is a property indicating the <b>thermal</b> conductivity, or ability to conduct heat, between two bodies in contact. The inverse of this property is termed <b>thermal</b> contact resistance.|$|E

25|$|<b>Thermal</b> {{conductivity}} (k, also denoted as λ or κ) is {{a measure}} of a material's ability to conduct heat. Heat transfer across materials of high <b>thermal</b> conductivity occurs at a higher rate than across materials of low <b>thermal</b> conductivity. In the International System of Units (SI), <b>thermal</b> conductivity is measured in watts per meter Kelvin (W/(m•K)).

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we develop}} a {{stochastic}} model of an ensemble of convective eddies that produces an equilibrium velocity distri- bution of <b>thermals.</b> In the model, mixed-layer <b>thermals</b> {{are assumed to}} possess identical buoyancy and are considered as rigid balls of constant radii. The motion of an ensemble of convective eddies is described using a Langevin equation with a nonlin- ear dissipative force and a random force whose structure is known for an ensemble of Brownian particles. It is shown that the probability density of an ensemble of <b>thermals</b> satisfies the K-form of the kinetic Fokker-Planck equation with variable coeffi- cients. The Maxwell equilibrium velocity distribution of convective <b>thermals</b> is constructed as a stationary solution of the Fokker-Planck equation. It is shown that the Maxwell velocity distribution well approximates experimental distributions in the turbulent convective mixed-layer...|$|R
