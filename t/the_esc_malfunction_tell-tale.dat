40|$|For the heating, ventilating, and air {{conditioning}} (HVAC) systems for commercial buildings, {{there has been a}} greater demand for reducing energy consump-tion. The economizers have been developed as a class of energy saving devices that may increase the energy efficiency by taking advantage of outdoor air during cool or cold weather. However, in practice, many economizers do not operate in the expected manner and waste even more energy than before in-stallation. Better control strategy is needed for opti-mal and robust operation. This paper presents two related aspects of research on dynamic modeling and control for economizers. First, a Modelica based dy-namic model is developed for a single-duct air-side economizer. The model development was based on Dymola and AirConditioning Library with some re-vision on water medium and heat exchanger model-ing. Such transient model will lay a more quality foundation for control design. Second, for a three-state operation for air-side economizers, a self-optimizing control strategy is developed based on the extremum seeking control (<b>ESC).</b> <b>The</b> mechanical cooling can be minimized by optimizing the outdoor air damper opening via extremum seeking. Such has much less dependency on the knowledge of econo-mizer model, and thus has more promise for practical operation. In addition, an anti-windup ESC scheme is proposed as an enhancement for <b>the</b> existing <b>ESC</b> techniques. <b>The</b> simulation results validated the ef-fectiveness of the dynamic model of the economizer, demonstrated the potential of using <b>ESC</b> to achieve <b>the</b> minimal mechanical cooling load in a self-optimizing manner, and illustrated <b>the</b> possibility of <b>ESC</b> <b>malfunctioning</b> under actuator (damper) satura-tion and the capability of anti-windup ESC in pre-venting such undesirable behavior...|$|R

40|$|Seasonal and interannual {{variations}} in the East Sakhalin Current (ESC) are investi-gated using ten-year records of the sea level anomaly (SLA) observed by the TOPEX/ POSEIDON (T/P) altimeter. The T/P SLA clearly documents seasonal and interannual {{variations in}} <b>the</b> <b>ESC</b> along <b>the</b> east coast of Sakhalin Island, although sea ice masks the region from January to April. Estimates of surface current velocity anomaly de-rived from T/P SLA are in good agreement with drifting buoy observations. <b>The</b> <b>ESC</b> is strong in winter, with a typical current velocity of 30 – 40 cm s– 1 in December, and almost disappears in summer. Southward flow of <b>the</b> <b>ESC</b> is confined to the shelf and slope region and consists of two velocity cores. These features of <b>the</b> <b>ESC</b> are consist-ent with short-term observations reported in previous studies. Analysis of the ten-year records of T/P SLA confirms that the structure of <b>the</b> <b>ESC</b> is maintained each winter and the seasonal cycle is repeated every year, although the strength of <b>the</b> <b>ESC</b> shows large interannual variations.
