40|$|Soybean cultivars show {{significant}} differences in seed cadmium (Cd) concentrations, primarily because of genetic rather than environmental, factors. Through grafting experiments, we demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> Cd concentration {{is determined by the}} Cd-accumulation capacity of the roots: in cultivars with a low capacity for Cd-accumulation in the roots, Cd is translocated to and accumulates in <b>the</b> <b>shoots.</b> However, cultivars differ in the seed Cd content. Next, we investigated how Cd translocated from the root to <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> is distributed to and accumulates in each shoot organ during soybean development. Compared to cultivars with low seed concentrations of Cd, those with high concentrations had higher Cd concentrations in all <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> organs during development. The leaves (including petioles and fallen leaves) had the highest Cd concentration and the seeds the lowest. In Suzuyutaka, which had high Cd concentration in the seeds, the concentration of Cd distributed from <b>the</b> <b>shoots</b> to <b>the</b> leaves was 67 % and that distributed from <b>the</b> <b>shoots</b> to <b>the</b> seeds was 13 %. In Kantou 100, which had low Cd concentration in the seeds, 57 % Cd was distributed from <b>the</b> <b>shoots</b> to <b>the</b> leaves and 21 % from <b>the</b> <b>shoots</b> to <b>the</b> seeds. These results suggest that cultivars that have a low capacity for Cd accumulation in the roots have a mechanism that prevents Cd accumulation in the seeds by promoting its accumulation in the leaves...|$|R

5|$|Brocius waived the {{preliminary}} hearing so he and his case could be immediately transferred to Tucson.

5|$|If {{the police}} {{identified}} Bostic even before <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> occurred, {{he would have}} faced a two-year prison sentence for violating the terms of his parole, since he was out past his curfew.

A motor vehicle theft or gun possession conviction would have been Bostic's third felony, likely resulting in a lengthy prison sentence.|$|E
40|$|Phytoremediation, using {{plants to}} extract heavy metals, such as Cd, from {{contaminated}} soils, is an emerging technology. Experiments {{were conducted in}} order to investigate the effect of Cd concentration in soil on growth and the absorption of Cd, Zn, and Cu by <b>the</b> <b>shoots.</b> <b>The</b> experiments were conducted on 8 Asteraceae species using Cd concentrations of 3. 4, 6. 5, and 9. 5 μg g- 1 of dry soil.

40|$|Spinach plants (Spinacea oleracea L. cv. Estivato) {{were grown}} an {{nutrient}} solutions under deficient, normal and excess sulfate supply. In both young and mature plants net uptake of sulfate and its transport to <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> increased with increasing sulfate supply, but bath processes proceeded {{at a higher}} rate in young as compared to mature plants. The relative sulfate transport, i. e. the relative amount of the sulfate taken up that is transported to <b>the</b> <b>shoot,</b> decreased with increasing sulfate supply. Apparently, net uptake of sulfate is not strictly controlled by the sulfur demand of <b>the</b> <b>shoot,</b> but xylem loading appears to counteract excess transport of sulfate to <b>the</b> <b>shoot.</b> Fumigation with H 2 S or SO 2 reduced net uptake of sulfate by the roots in sulfur-deficient plants and absolute as well as relative sulfate transport to <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> independent of <b>the</b> three sulfate levels supplied to the plant. At the same time thiol contents of <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> and <b>the</b> root were enhanced by fumigation with H 2 S and SO 2.
