25|$|Williams {{has been}} noted for her unusual and {{colorful}} outfits on court. In 2002, there was much <b>talk</b> <b>when</b> she wore a black lycra catsuit at the US Open. At the 2004 US Open, Williams wore denim skirts and knee-high boots—tournament officials, however, did not allow her to wear the boots during matches. At Wimbledon in 2008, the white trench coat she wore during warm-up for her opening match {{was the subject of}} much discussion since it was worn despite the sunny weather.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{discovered}} {{that one of the}} last people to see Paula alive was a man who lived along Harbour Road. He {{was in the midst of}} an argument with his girlfriend when she walked by. The man stormed off in a jealous rage shortly thereafter and depending on different statements he made, he went to his shack and spent the evening by himself, or he drove his truck up the travel portion of the trail (where Paula was heading). He lied to police on several occasions and was a person of interest in 1946 and again in 1952 when the case was revisited. Reportedly, he told at least two people that he knew within a hundred feet where Paula was buried but later claimed it was just idle <b>talk.</b> <b>When</b> no evidence was found that a crime had actually been committed, no body was ever discovered, and no forensic clues were identified, this avenue of the investigation ended.|$|E

Fanning denied that the band was finished, instead claiming that Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994-2000 was spawned due to {{a deal with the}} band's record label.

500|$|Cartman is foul-mouthed (as are his friends) as a {{means for}} Parker and Stone to portray how they believe young boys really <b>talk</b> <b>when</b> they are alone. According to Parker, Cartman does not possess the [...] "underlying sweetness" [...] of the show's other child characters. Cartman is shown at times to be {{completely}} amoral and remorseless. Cartman is amused by bodily functions and toilet humor, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes.|$|E
500|$|One {{major element}} of the child-rearing {{strategy}} described in the book was treating Liu as an adult and [...] "encourag her to develop a mature style of thinking". [...] Liu's parents never used baby <b>talk</b> <b>when</b> Liu was a child, and they allowed her to argue with them but required her to present reasoned arguments like an adult. [...] According to education scholar Ben Mardell, the book's focus on independent thinking and intellectual development was a [...] "break with the past" [...] in China, where both early and higher education often emphasize rote learning.|$|E

500|$|In September 2012, {{following}} {{the hiring of}} former General Hospital executive producer Jill Farren Phelps onto the series, Francis was let go from the soap opera due to budgetary cuts from Sony Pictures Television and CBS. Phelps had previously stated {{that there would be}} cast changes to the series due to monetary reasons. When asked specifically about reports indicating Francis' dismissal, she said: [...] "Genie and I had a wonderful <b>talk</b> <b>when</b> I came to Y and I think we're really quite fond of each other. She's a magnificent actress." [...] Despite confirmations that the actress' dismissal was due to budgetary reasons, Jillian Bowe of Zap2it reported a rumor that [...] "the veteran's tenure on the show wasn't well-received by the brass at CBS and Sony". Sara Bibel of Xfinity reported another rumor about her dismissal, saying it was [...] "no secret" [...] that Francis and Phelps [...] "did not get along" [...] while both worked on General Hospital, and that [...] "few are surprised that the two were not eager to work together again".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the praise}} for the visual effects, there was {{division}} over the human storylines. The Hollywood Reporter Kirk Honeycutt liked [...] "how a teen plotline gets tied in {{to the end of}} the world", while Empire Ian Nathan praised Shia LaBeouf as [...] "a smart, natural comedian, [...] levels the bluntness of this toy story with an ironic bluster". Ain't It Cool News founder Harry Knowles felt Bay's style conflicted with Spielberg's, arguing the military story only served as a distraction from Sam. James Berardinelli hated the film as he did not connect with the characters in-between the action, which he found tedious. Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan found the humans [...] "oddly lifeless, doing little besides marking time until those big toys fill the screen", while ComingSoon.net's Joshua Starnes felt the Transformers were [...] "completely believable, right up to the moment they open their mouths to <b>talk,</b> <b>when</b> they revert to bad cartoon characters". Daily Herald Matt Arado was annoyed that [...] "the Transformers [...] little more than supporting players", and felt the middle act was sluggish. CNN's Tom Charity questioned the idea of a film based on a toy, and felt it would [...] "buzz its youthful demographic [...] but leave the rest of us wondering if Hollywood could possibly aim lower".|$|E

500|$|While most child {{characters}} {{on the show}} are foul-mouthed, Kenny is often even more risqué with his dialogue. Parker and Stone state that they depict Kenny and his friends in this manner in order to display how young boys really <b>talk</b> <b>when</b> they are alone. While Kenny is often cynical and profane, Parker notes that there nonetheless is an [...] "underlying sweetness" [...] aspect to the character, and Time magazine described Kenny and his friends as [...] "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence". He is amused by toilet humor and bodily functions, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes. Kenny is shown to desire intercourse in the episode [...] "The Ring", when Kenny gets a girlfriend and is overjoyed {{to find out that}} she has a reputation as a slut. Kenny is also lecherous, and often portrayed as being eager to do and say disgusting things in an attempt to impress others or earn money. Conversely, his alter-ego Mysterion is seemingly mature, principled, and serious-minded, the only exception being one instance in [...] "Mysterion Rises" [...] in which he takes delight in irritating Cartman. As Mysterion he convinces his parents to take better care of themselves and their children, as seen by their reaction when he questions them about the cult of Cthulhu. He also uses his disguise to protect his sister Karen (who refers to Mysterion as her [...] "guardian angel"), as revealed in [...] "The Poor Kid." [...] In all of his guises, however, Kenny is depicted as being uncommonly selfless, dying for the sake of others and spending all of his time working so he could buy his little sister a doll.|$|E
