5|$|After {{a period}} within the sangha, Koṇḍañña retired to the Himalayas {{for the last}} twelve years of his life. This is {{attributed}} to two reasons in Buddhist literature. The first reason was that Koṇḍañña considered his presence {{to be a source}} of inconvenience for Sariputra and Moggallana, the two chief disciples of The Buddha. As the seniormost member of the sangha, Koṇḍañña lead the monks on the alms-round, but during dharma talks, the two chief disciples sat on either side of the Buddha and Koṇḍañña behind them. The two chief disciples were uncomfortable sitting in front of Koṇḍañña, so he decided to solve the problem by absenting himself. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> to which Koṇḍañña's leave is attributed was to spend more quiet time in religious practice, which was rendered difficult due to the attention that the sangha gained from the public.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> for {{the close}} {{cultural}} links is the clear pattern of net southward migration. There are more Scots in England than English people {{north of the}} border. Much of this movement is cross-county rather than distant migration, and the incomers thus bring aspects of their culture as well as reinforce shared cultural traits {{from both sides of}} the Anglo-Scottish border.|$|E
25|$|A {{large piece}} of {{compressed}} ice, or a glacier, appears blue, as large quantities of water appear blue. This is because water molecules absorb other colors more efficiently than blue. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> for the blue color of glaciers {{is the lack of}} air bubbles. Air bubbles, which give a white color to ice, are squeezed out by pressure increasing the density of the created ice.|$|E

25|$|Speaking {{about his}} {{activities}} in popularizing science, Sagan {{said that there}} were at least two reasons for scientists to share the purposes of science and its contemporary state. Simple self-interest was one: much of the funding for science came from the public, and the public therefore had the right to know how the money was being spent. If scientists increased public admiration for science, there was a good chance of having more public supporters. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> was the excitement of communicating one's own excitement about science to others.|$|E
25|$|The Roman {{could be}} the first piece of non-Celtic vernacular {{literature}} to have survived from Scotland, an honour often thought to belong to the Brus of John Barbour, written one and a half centuries later in Middle English. It has been neglected in Scotland mainly because it did not come to the attention of scholars until relatively recently, being preserved only in Continental Europe. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> for neglect is probably that it was written in French, a linguistic-literary tradition which died out by the later Middle Ages. The Roman de Fergus however shows that, despite its future, French-culture flourished in Scotland during the High Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the reasons}} that the Provisional IRA and Provisional Sinn Féin were founded, in December 1969 and January 1970, respectively, was that people like Ó Brádaigh, O'Connell and McKee opposed {{participation}} in constitutional politics. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> was the failure of the Cathal Goulding leadership to provide for the defence of Irish nationalist areas during the 1969 Northern Ireland riots. When, at the December 1969 IRA convention and the January 1970 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis, the delegates voted to participate in the Dublin (Leinster House), Belfast (Stormont) and London (Westminster) parliaments, the organisations split. Adams, who had joined the republican movement in the early 1960s, sided with the Provisionals.|$|E

25|$|On November 18, 1955, a non-violent {{splinter}} group of nationalists calling themselves La Quinta Columna (The 5th Column) {{broke away from}} the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party due to not supporting the ideas and thoughts of Albizu Campos, as to a Puerto Rico relationship with Spain as its Mother country and their nationalistic love for Puerto Rico as their Motherland. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> for the {{splinter group}} was due to the violence {{that took place in the}} 1950s. This splinter group would later become known in 1968 as El Movimiento Indio Taino de Boriken (The Taino Indian Movement of Puerto Rico) which was primarily made up of the children of the Puerto Rican Nationalists whom would come to establish the indigenous grassroots civil rights movement in Puerto Rico.|$|E
25|$|A {{section of}} this housing, on Santa Isabel Alley, was torn down and {{replaced}} by the National Theater in the latter 19th century. During the late 19th century and very early 20th, this theatre {{was the site of}} most of Mexico City's high culture, presenting events such as theatre, operettas, Viennese dance and more. It was then decided to replace this building with a more opulent one for the upcoming Centennial of Mexican Independence celebrations in 1910. The old theatre was demolished in 1901, and the new theatre would be called the Gran Teatro de Ópera. The work was awarded to Italian architect Adamo Boari, who favored neoclassical and art nouveau styles and who is responsible for the Palacio del Correo which is across the street. Adamo Boari promised in October 1904 to build a grand metallic structure, which at that time only existed in the United States, but not to this size. The first stone of the building was placed by Porfirio Díaz in 1904. Despite the 1910 deadline, by 1913, the building was hardly begun with only a basic shell. One {{reason for this is that}} the project became more complicated than anticipated as the heavy building sank into the soft spongy subsoil. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> was the political and economic instability that would lead to the Mexican Revolution. Full hostilities suspended construction of the palace completely and Adamo Boari returned to Italy.|$|E

Yet all architects have not followed that , shown in Vitruvius's text ... accordingly I have made use, at the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, of the Ionic order, on the view that it is delicate and of greater beauty than the Doric, and more ornamented and enriched with distinctive features.|$|E

500|$|... "Un-American Graffiti" [...] is {{the first}} episode of Veronica Mars not {{to be part of}} a broader story arc in the form of a mystery that Veronica solves over several episodes. The crew's plan at the {{beginning}} of the season was to have the two-part murder mystery of Hearst's basketball coach, encapsulated in [...] "Postgame Mortem" [...] and [...] "Mars, Bars", to stretch over the rest of the season beginning with this episode, but this idea was changed around the airing of [...] "Spit & Eggs". Series creator Rob Thomas gave two rationales for the creative change. The first was that he believed that the story arcs alienated new or casual viewers, meaning that the change would solve the series' low Nielsen ratings, while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> was that he noticed that after the first season, the show had garnered the most narrative criticism about the story arcs. On trying the new narrative structure, Thomas stated, [...] "It seems like a good time to do it—a good fun test balloon. Try it over five [...] and see how fans and non-fans react." [...] However, Thomas also commented that the show would continue to exhibit a degree of serialization through Veronica's romantic and personal life. In addition, the new story formula was a way to have episodes focus on Veronica's personal life instead of devoting most of the episode time to advancing rushed mysteries.|$|E

2500|$|The town {{is noted}} for its white and blue domed houses. The houses are painted in white lime water so that the {{rainwater}} which falls over it runs down and can be collected. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> for painting the houses white is for aesthetic purposes. The other explanation given is that during the Ottoman rule of Greece, which lasted for over 400 years, Greeks {{were not allowed to}} fly their white flag. In defiance, in Oia they painted their entire housing complex in white with domes giving the village an effective white perspective and elegance. Impressive houses in the town are those [...] "cliff houses" [...] built in the niches carved into the caldera slopes with provision of air-filled pumice which provides insulation benefits to the building, keeping it warm in winter and cool in summer.|$|E
2500|$|The sixth chapter {{discusses}} {{specifically the}} Japanese Peruvians during the World War II period. This {{is the sole}} single country-specific chapter.

Takenaka stated that this was [...] "it is unclear if {{and to what extent}} an extensive field research was conducted, especially since there is no detailed description of authors’ methods." [...] The United States government never made reparation payments to or an official apology for the ethnic Japanese Peruvians living in the United States, and that is <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> why Lesser believed the focus on Peru was a [...] "smart choice".

Lesser stated that Asian American studies and ethnic studies courses would find the discussion of legal proceedings related to Japanese-Peruvians who were interned [...] "particularly useful".|$|E
2500|$|Stevin's aim was {{to bring}} about a second age of wisdom, in which mankind would have {{recovered}} all of its earlier knowledge. He deduced that the language spoken in this age would have had to be Dutch, because, as he showed empirically, in that language, more concepts could be indicated with monosyllabic words than in any of the (European) languages he had compared it with. This {{was one of the reasons}} why he wrote all of his works in Dutch and left the translation of them for others to do. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> was that he wanted his works to be practically useful to people who had not mastered the common scientific language of the time, Latin.

2500|$|The dissenting Justices {{criticized the}} court's {{decision}} {{by suggesting that}} the original rationale for the [...] "automobile exception" [...] was being ignored. One {{of the reasons for}} the [...] "automobile exception" [...] introduced by Carroll v. United States was that the mobility of automobiles makes it impractical to obtain a warrant. But in many situations police perform a warrantless search of a car even after the driver has been arrested and the car has been rendered completely immobile. In other situations, the police could choose to detain the car and driver while awaiting a warrant, although the court has recognized that seizing car and driver for the time it takes to issue a warrant may be considered a greater intrusion than performing an immediate warrantless search. Without the reason of mobility, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> for the Carroll decision is often the only one in force when a warrantless search is performed: The diminished expectation of privacy in an automobile. The dissenting Justices pointed out that even though an automobile has a lower expectation of privacy, the court has continually recognized that containers do not suffer those same diminished expectations. Furthermore, unlike detaining an entire vehicle and driver, seizing a package inside of the car to await a magistrate is not impractical. Therefore the mobility rationale from the Carroll decision does not apply to containers in the car, which can be removed and therefore do not have the same [...] "practical mobility problem" [...] that a car does.|$|E
2500|$|The Kelvin {{scale is}} called {{absolute}} for two reasons. One is Kelvin's, that its formal character {{is independent of}} the properties of particular materials. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> is that its zero is in a sense absolute, in that it indicates absence of microscopic classical motion of the constituent particles of matter, so {{that they have a}} limiting specific heat of zero for zero temperature, according to the third law of thermodynamics. Nevertheless, a Kelvin temperature does in fact have a definite numerical value that has been arbitrarily chosen by tradition and is dependent on the property of a particular materials; it is simply less arbitrary than relative [...] "degrees" [...] scales such as Celsius and Fahrenheit. [...] Being an absolute scale with one fixed point (zero), there is only one degree of freedom left to arbitrary choice, rather than two as in relative scales. For the Kelvin scale in modern times, this choice of convention is made to be that of setting the gas–liquid–solid triple point of water, a point which can be reliably reproduced as a standard experimental phenomenon, at a numerical value of 273.16 kelvins. The Kelvin scale is also called the thermodynamic scale. However, to demonstrate that its numerical value is indeed arbitrary, it is useful to point out that an alternate, less widely used absolute temperature scale exists called the Rankine scale, made to be aligned with the Fahrenheit scale as Kelvin is with Celsius.|$|E
2500|$|The {{method of}} assimilating {{individual}} life-forms into the collective has been represented differently over time. The only constant {{is that the}} infant, and fetal humanoids have been grown in an accelerated state and surgically receive implants connected directly into the brain (cannot be removed without death), as well as ocular devices, tool-enhanced limbs, armor, and other prosthetics. In Star Trek: First Contact, the method of adult assimilation is depicted with the more efficient injection of nanoprobes into the individual's bloodstream through a pair of tubules that spring forth from the drone's hand (while in [...] "The Best of Both Worlds" [...] and , at least some Borg were shown with a syringe like prosthetic that also acted as a data port {{that allowed them to}} interface directly with technology and share data between each other). Assimilation by tubules is depicted on-screen as being a usually fast-acting process, with the victim's skin pigmentation turning gray and mottled with visible dark tracks forming within moments of contact, though it seems that the longer the victim is being injected, the quicker they can be fully transformed. The individual is then taken away for complete assimilation by drones. The tubules can also allow for direct interfacing with technology, while they are also shown to be able to reconfigure and enhance such technology into Borg technology. Sometimes assimilated Borg have been noted to be neither male nor female. [...] One theory could be that their reproductive systems have been removed upon assimilation, yet drones such as Captain Picard and Seven of Nine are easily identified as male and female. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> may be that the species from whence they came was gender-less. Drones who have escaped the collective have also been shown to have a gender. The individual has all traces of individuality removed and implants are attached to the new drone so it can become an integrated part of the collective. This method of assimilation is also shown to be much more surgical in nature. In Star Trek: First Contact a captured crew member is shown to have a forearm and an eye physically removed and replaced with cybernetic implants.|$|E
