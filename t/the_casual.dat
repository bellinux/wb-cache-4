5|$|Conditions in <b>the</b> <b>casual</b> wards {{were worse}} {{than in the}} {{relieving}} rooms and deliberately designed to discourage vagrants, who were considered potential trouble-makers and probably disease-ridden. Vagrants who presented themselves {{at the door of}} a workhouse were {{at the mercy of the}} porter, whose decision it was whether or not to allocate them a bed for the night in <b>the</b> <b>casual</b> ward. Those refused entry risked being sentenced to two weeks of hard labour if they were found begging or sleeping in the open and prosecuted for an offence under the Vagrancy Act 1824.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, Rowling parted {{company with}} her agent, Christopher Little, {{moving to a}} new agency founded {{by one of his}} staff, Neil Blair. On 23 February 2012, his agency, the Blair Partnership, {{announced}} on its website that Rowling was set to publish a new book targeted at adults. In a press release, Rowling said that her new book would be quite different from Harry Potter. In April 2012, Little, Brown and Company announced that the book was titled <b>The</b> <b>Casual</b> Vacancy and would be released on 27 September 2012. Rowling gave several interviews and made appearances to promote <b>The</b> <b>Casual</b> Vacancy, including at the London Southbank Centre, the Cheltenham Literature Festival, Charlie Rose and the Lennoxlove Book Festival. In its first three weeks of release, <b>The</b> <b>Casual</b> Vacancy sold over 1 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In January 2006, Flying Scotsman duly {{entered the}} National Railway Museum's {{workshops}} {{for a major}} overhaul to return it to Gresley's original specification and to renew its boiler certificate. It was initially estimated that this would only take one year, and cost around £750,000. The bay in which the locomotive was being refurbished was on view to visitors to the NRM but the engine was rapidly dismantled {{to such an extent}} that the running plate was the only component recognisable to <b>the</b> <b>casual</b> observer.|$|E

[...] His first {{band was}} The Avro Boys, from Shepherd's Bush, who became Tony Craven & <b>The</b> <b>Casuals</b> in <b>the</b> late 1950s. In 1960, <b>The</b> <b>Casuals</b> linked up with new singer Frankie Reid and McCulloch remained with the group until October 1962. During his time with Frankie Reid & <b>The</b> <b>Casuals,</b> one of <b>the</b> band's drummers was Mitch Mitchell.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to game, mutton was consumed {{from time to}} time. Keeping sheep provided wool to the household, and when a sheep reached an age when it was unsuitable for wool production, it could be harvested as mutton. Sheep were originally introduced to the Americas through the Spanish in Florida. In the north, the Dutch and English also introduced several varieties of sheep. <b>The</b> <b>casual</b> English practice of animal husbandry allowed sheep to roam free, consuming a variety of forage. Foragebased diets produce meat with a characteristically strong, gamey flavor and a tough consistency, which requires aging and slow cooking to tenderize.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 2012, it was {{announced}} that the BBC would be adapting <b>The</b> <b>Casual</b> Vacancy into a television drama miniseries. Rowling's agent, Neil Blair acted as producer, through his independent production company and with Rick Senat serving as executive producer. Rowling collaborated on the adaptation, serving as an executive producer for the series. The series aired in three parts from 15 February to 1 March 2015.|$|E
5|$|The New York Knicks {{regularly}} held {{events like}} Autographs for Supplies at the NBA Store where New York players like Eddy Curry, Zach Randolph, and WNBA's Kym Hampton meet fans and signs items {{in an effort}} to raise school supplies for children and stress academics. In 2007, the store held a fashion exhibition to celebrate <b>the</b> <b>Casual</b> Male Retail Group acquisition of the men's big & tall clothing company Jared M., a company popular among athletes and celebrities for its custom sportswear; several NBA players were happy to show their support since the founder had fitted many of them in the past.|$|E

5|$|The film {{ran into}} {{production}} trouble in mid 2010 and {{was close to}} being shelved, with sources reporting that Thiagarajan sold the film to Santiago Martin to revive the project. The reports proved to be untrue, and Thiagarajan maintained {{that he was still}} the producer of the film. The film had also begun to surpass its budget, due to <b>the</b> <b>casual</b> nature of shooting and difficulties in creating historical sets. The first shots from the film and the video for three songs were unveiled publicly in March2011, with the publicity campaign initiated after this.|$|E
5|$|After a posting to Amberley, Queensland, Cresswell {{served on}} the {{directing}} staff {{of the first two}} courses held at the newly formed RAAF Staff College, Point Cook. The college was the successor organisation to the wartime RAAF Staff School, and commenced its first six-month course on 13June 1949. Cresswell had by this time reverted to the rank of squadron leader, as the air force and its wartime officer corps shrank dramatically following demobilisation. On 10July 1950, he was appointed commanding officer of No.21 (City of Melbourne) Squadron, a Citizen Air Force unit based at Laverton and equipped with Mustangs crewed by reserve pilots. Cresswell was unimpressed by what he saw as <b>the</b> <b>casual</b> attitude displayed by his part-time pilots and soon had them practising appropriate fighter tactics.|$|E
5|$|Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, Rowling {{was working}} as a {{researcher}} and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997. There were six sequels, of which the last, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was released in 2007. Since then, Rowling has written four books for adult readers: <b>The</b> <b>Casual</b> Vacancy (2012) and—under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith—the crime fiction novels The Cuckoo's Calling (2013), The Silkworm (2014) and Career of Evil (2015).|$|E

50|$|The other {{documented}} precursor, {{according to}} Colin Blaney, was a subculture known as Perry Boys, which {{originated in the}} mid-1970s as a precursor to <b>the</b> <b>casuals.</b> <b>The</b> Perry Boys subculture consisted of Manchester football hooligans styling their hair into a flick and wearing sportswear, Fred Perry shirts and Dunlop Green Flash trainers.|$|R
50|$|With the Kingdom of Iraq gaining {{independence}} from Britain, Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya renamed to Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya Al-Malikiya (Royal Air Force), {{and returned to}} the name of Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya when Iraq became a republic in 1958. On 2 March 1934, Jawiya beat Madrasat Al-Harbia 1-0 to retain <b>the</b> <b>Casuals</b> Cup, and also retained the Prince Ghazi Cup in April of that year with a 2-1 extra time win against Al-Lasilki. 1935 saw Jawiya once again win both tournaments, defeating Al-Lasilki 1-0 in <b>the</b> <b>Casuals</b> Cup final on 20 April and also defeating Al-Lasilki, this time 2-1, in the Prince Ghazi Cup final. By winning three consecutive Casuals Cups, Jawiya were allowed to keep the trophy on a permanent basis. Jawiya reached the final of <b>the</b> <b>Casuals</b> Cup for <b>the</b> fourth successive time in 1936 where they were set to play Madrasat Al-Harbia, but the result of the game was never recorded and it remains unknown which team won the tournament, {{which turned out to be}} the final edition of the competition.|$|R
5|$|Imaginos was envisioned {{as a rock}} opera to be {{published}} as a trilogy of double albums, with a storyline encompassing about two hundred years of history, {{from the beginning of}} the 19th century to the end of the 20th. This album represents an abbreviated version of the first volume of that planned trilogy, but with the songs arranged out of order, rendering the story harder to comprehend. Even when the song lyrics are analyzed in the chronological order that was devised by the authors and is followed in this section, the narrative progression is scarce and the content often difficult to decipher for <b>the</b> <b>casual</b> reader. However, thanks to various comments in interviews by Pearlman and Bouchard, and the extensive sleeve notes by Pearlman that were issued with the original release, it is possible to reconstruct the story to a great extent.|$|E
5|$|On 27 August 1964, the British {{aircraft}} carrier HMS Victorious {{and her two}} destroyer escorts sailed through the Sunda Strait, an international waterway claimed by Indonesia, en route to Australia. Upset by <b>the</b> <b>casual</b> warning the British had given of the ships' impending passage through the Strait (a telephone call made two days before), the lack of mention of the carrier in the warning, and wary {{of the possibility that}} the British were attempting to provoke them into a violent response, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided two days later to attempt to bar the warships from making the return journey to Singapore, scheduled for the middle of September.|$|E
5|$|The {{team had}} a short time for finalizing the {{different}} aspects of the shoot, including rehearsing the whole sequence. They also had just one night to complete shooting and due to <b>the</b> <b>casual</b> nature of the song, decided to invite Madonna's close friends and family to be in it. Contrary to normal shooting schedules, the team had to work fast before the sun came up, since they were portraying a party at night. Following the choreography, every person on set had cues about their position and where their part would come in the shooting. A number of designers contributed clothing for the singer to wear, including Moschino, Discount Universe, SSUR, Chanel, Majesty Black and shoes by Giuseppe Zanotti. According to Amber Kallor from Style.com, various contemporary fashion trends appeared in the video, including candy-colored hairs, black lips, white bows and glitter eye makeup.|$|E

25|$|The Heritage Centre {{historically}} {{known as}} the Spike has been restored in part to retell {{the fate of the}} vagrant and indeed, <b>the</b> <b>casuals,</b> many of whom had a large part to play in the building of this Town.|$|R
5|$|A typical early 19th-century casual ward was {{a single}} large room {{furnished}} {{with some kind of}} bedding and perhaps a bucket {{in the middle of the}} floor for sanitation. The bedding on offer could be very basic: the Poor Law authorities in Richmond in the mid-1840s provided only straw and rags, although beds were available for the sick. In return for their night's accommodation vagrants might be expected to undertake a certain amount of work before leaving the next day, such as at Guisborough, where men were required to break stones for three hours and women to pick oakum, two hours before breakfast and one after. Until the passage of <b>the</b> <b>Casual</b> Poor Act 1882 vagrants could discharge themselves before 11 am on the day following their admission, but from 1883 onwards they were required to be detained until 9 am on the second day. Those who were admitted to the workhouse again within one month were required to be detained until the fourth day after their admission.|$|E
5|$|Leif's {{successful}} expedition in Vinland encouraged other Norsemen to {{also make}} the journey. The first apparent contact between the Norse and the indigenous people, who the Norse later referred to as skrælingjar, was made by his brother Thorvald, and resulted in hostilities and killing. In the end there were no permanent Norse settlements in Vinland, although sporadic voyages at least to Markland for forages, timber and trade possibly lasted for centuries. <b>The</b> <b>casual</b> tone of references to these areas may suggest that their discovery was not seen as particularly significant by contemporaries, or that it {{was assumed to be}} public knowledge, or both. Knowledge of the Vinland journeys might have spread around medieval Europe, as writers such as Adam of Bremen made mention of remote lands to the west. It has been suggested that the knowledge of Vinland might have been maintained in European seaports in the 15th century, and that Christopher Columbus, who claimed in a letter to have visited Iceland in 1477, could have heard stories of it.|$|E
5|$|On 13 June 1905, a {{passenger}} service {{began on the}} short branch to South Acton. A short fifth platform for the single car train of the South Acton branch was provided {{to the north of}} the eastbound island platform. At first the service ran to Hounslow West and to Uxbridge but it was later reduced to a shuttle between Acton Town and South Acton on 15 February 1932. The South Acton branch was closed on 28 February 1959 due to low usage; its platform at Acton Town has not been removed and is still visible. The platform is hidden behind advertising hoardings and not obvious to <b>the</b> <b>casual</b> observer. Much of the branch remains including a bridge support on the south side of Bollo Lane. In the picture, the area behind the hoarding in the background is the location of the former branch platform (Platform 5) which was only ever very short, two carriages at most.|$|E

5|$|Two more {{nuclear tests}} were {{conducted}} in the Monte Bello Islands as part of Operation Mosaic in 1956, the detonations taking place on Alpha and Trimouille Islands. By the 1980s the radioactivity had decayed {{to the point where}} it was no longer hazardous to <b>the</b> <b>casual</b> visitor, but there were still radioactive metal fragments containing cobalt-60, the remains of Plym. The island remained a prohibited area until 1992. A 2006 zoological survey found that the wildlife had recovered, and that the Aprasia rostrata, the legless lizard discovered by Hill, was not extinct. As part of the Gorgon gas project, rats and feral cats were eradicated from the Monte Bello Islands in 2009, and birds and marsupials were transplanted from nearby Barrow Island to Hermite Island. Today, the Monte Bello Islands are a park. Visitors are advised not to spend more than an hour per day at the test sites, or to take relics of the tests as souvenirs. A pyramid-shaped obelisk marks the site of the explosion on Alpha Island.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the coal}} mines of Wales and {{northern}} England, the Cornish mines generally {{did not provide}} housing for their workers, largely owing to <b>the</b> <b>casual</b> nature of work under the tribute team system. Bal maidens would typically travel to the mines from their family homes, some families building homes near the mine. (Until the Inclosure Acts of the late 18th and early 19thcenturies, anyone moving to an area {{had the right to}} build a house on common land, provided they could build it overnight.) They would generally remain living with their families until marriage. (Much of early 19thcentury Cornwall retained the old custom of 'keeping company', by which a couple would not be formally married until the woman became pregnant, and the woman would continue to work and to live with her family until that time.) While some lived at or near the mine at which they worked, mine workers typically walked three to four miles (five to sevenkm) to and from work each day. The miners' cottages were generally crowded and squalid, sometimes with ten or more people living in each small cottage, while the abstraction of the region's water supplies for use in the mines led to serious problems with sanitation and the provision of fresh water.|$|E

The club then {{returned}} to Franklyn Road, where the Reserves had continued playing in the Surrey Combination League.
