5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, a legitimate expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. <b>To</b> <b>derogate</b> <b>from</b> the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|E
500|$|However, in Review Publishing, the Court of Appeal {{held that}} the common law of defamation, as {{modified}} by the Defamation Act, restricts the right to free speech. The appellants in that case {{pointed out that the}} Defamation Ordinance 1960, which presupposed the existence of the common law of defamation, had been enacted before the 1963 Constitution of the State of Singapore. Thus, it could not have been a law enacted <b>to</b> <b>derogate</b> <b>from</b> the right to free speech guaranteed by Article 10(1)(a) of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia, which became applicable to Singapore when it became a state of the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963. The Court disagreed, holding that Article 105(1) of the 1963 State Constitution, which was the predecessor of Article 162, had the effect of re-enacting all laws existing as at 16 September 1963, including the Defamation Ordinance. Thus Article 105(1) itself was an express restriction on the right to free speech. If this was not the case, then when the 1963 State Constitution came into force all laws which restricted Article 10(1) of the Federal Constitution would have become unconstitutional, a result which the Court regarded as an [...] "astonishing conclusion".|$|E

Other countries, such as Germany and France have their own standards, but all follow and stay conformity with the ECHR. Similarly, the ECHR is drawn from the traditions of every member state, and acts as a method for maintaining minimum standards on which there is general consensus. Despite its controversy, this may be viewed as a uniquely British measure, especially given the fact that the Convention was drafted under the direction of the British government.|$|E

Part III discusses the discourse of cultural exceptions in the context of international trade.

Part IV considers cultural exceptions to international environmental norms.

The international community refuses to recognize these practices as 2 ̆ 2 cultural 2 ̆ 2 and insists on compliance with the international legal norm. However the international community does accept these practices as 2 ̆ 2 cultural 2 ̆ 2 among some indigenous nations and has granted a de minimis cultural exception to environmental norms for these indigenous nations.
