5|$|The {{grant of}} feu-ferme {{status in the}} middle of the 15th century meant that the town could deal with its own {{administrative}} issues and fiscal policies for the first time. The first mention of a town council was around 1582. The head courts of the burghs met either in the common muir (now known as Volunteers' Green) or in the Tolbooth on Tolbooth Street, particularly in the summer months. When Kirkcaldy was awarded royal burgh status in 1644, the duties of the provost were initially performed by bailies, councillors, and magistrates. The first Lord Provost, Robert Whyt, was elected to the post around 1658. The burgh was one of four in Scotland to use <b>two</b> <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> arms, introduced in 1673. One bears the motto Vigilando Munio ("I secure by watching"), and the other displays the figure of Saint Bryce, Kirkcaldy's patron saint.|$|E
25|$|The Danish–Icelandic Act of Union, an {{agreement}} with Denmark signed on 1 December 1918 and valid for 25years, recognised Iceland as a fully sovereign state in a personal union with Denmark. The Government of Iceland established an embassy in Copenhagen and requested that Denmark handle Icelandic foreign policy. Danish embassies around the world displayed <b>two</b> <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> arms and two flags: those of the Kingdom of Denmark {{and those of the}} Kingdom of Iceland.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} form of protective body armor was chainmail. There are also {{references to the}} practice of wearing <b>two</b> <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> mail (dir’ayn), the one under the main one being shorter or even made of fabric or leather. Hauberks and large wooden or wickerwork shields were used as a protection in combat. The soldiers were usually equipped with swords that were hung in a baldric. They also possessed spears and daggers. Umar was the first Muslim ruler to organize the army as a state department. This reform was introduced in 637. A beginning was made with the Quraish and the Ansar and the system was gradually extended to the whole of Arabia and to Muslims of conquered lands.|$|E

25|$|The {{chest was}} a very {{important}} piece of furniture, and is often to be met with covered with the most elaborate carving (Orleans Museum). There is a splendid chest (14th century) in the Cluny Museum; the front is carved with twelve knights in armour standing under as many arches, and the spandrels are filled in with faces, dragons and so on. But it is to the 15th century that we look for the best work of this class; there is no finer example than that in the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin. The front is a very animated hunting scene most decoratively arranged in a scheme of foliage, and the top bears <b>two</b> <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> arms with helms, crests and mantling. But the more general custom in chest decoration was to employ tracery with or without figure work; Avignon Museum contains some typical examples of the latter class.|$|E
25|$|The Santiago Mixquitla {{church is}} located in the far {{northwest}} of the city. The complex in entered through a portal with three arches, an entablature and pinnacles. This leads into a very large atrium, which is surrounded by a stone wall {{similar to that of the}} San Gabriel monastery. The facade of the church is wide and has a portal of grey sandstone, sculpted in a sober style from the 17th century. The entrance is formed by an arch supported by two pilasters. Above this, there is a choral window with two pilasters and <b>two</b> <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> arms. One belongs to Mexico and the other to Cholula. Above this, there is a niche which contains a cross. On either side, there are two pyramids with spheres. The bell tower has Salomonic columns on its corners. The church has three naves, with an octagonal cupola, some paintings and altarpieces. There is a sculpture of Saint James on horseback in the main altar area.|$|E
25|$|At {{the back}} of the town house lie six of the seven provost's lamps of the former royal burghs within Kirkcaldy district. The six lamps are from: Kirkcaldy, Burntisland, Kinghorn, Leven, and Buckhaven and Methil. These lamps once stood outside the houses of senior councillors, and were all brought to this site when the royal burghs were {{abolished}} in 1975. Only the lamp for Leslie is not there. Around the building, both of the town's <b>two</b> <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> arms can be seen. The spiritual coat of arms showing St Bryce is located at the south entrance and the one which depicts Dunfermline Abbey is at the west entrance. Inside the building itself, displayed across the stairwell is a mural designed by Walter Pritchard of the Glasgow School of Art. This makes references to the industries associated with the town such as linoleum, coal mining and weaving. Other references are to famous people such as Adam Smith and the Adam Brothers. Charles II is shown granting the town its royal burgh status in 1644, received by a figure in a Sinclair tartan.|$|E

50|$|The new Iraqi <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> arms was {{similarly}} {{based on that}} of the UAR, namely the Eagle of Saladin, which had {{become a symbol of}} Arab nationalism following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. Indeed, the only difference between the <b>two</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> arms was the presence of three green stars in the vertical white band on the eagle's shield, as opposed to the two stars of the UAR, and the specific Arabic script in the scroll under the eagle's feet bearing the name of the official name state.|$|R

To make this acceptable to the local populace, Jacobi said of the grand dukes, who were descendants of the old Zaehringen dynasty, Now the <b>two</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> arms during hundreds of years separated become one again and the Duke's kindness will not only unite the territories but marry the souls of the good citizens alike.|$|R
25|$|The RAE first {{tested it}} in an “as delivered” configuration. The wing airfoil was {{designed}} to support laminar flow to 60% of chord. In the “as delivered” configuration, a profile drag was measured which was representative of the wing section with boundary layer transition {{at the leading edge}} (0% laminar flow). Reducing the surface roughness reduced the drag at low lift coefficients to a level representative of laminar flow to 35% of chord. Measurements were made of the surface waviness. This showed peak wave amplitudes, above the mean, of approximately 0.011 inches over a two-inch span. The standard waviness criteria shows the critical wave height to be 0.0053 inches for this application. To reduce the waviness, RAE personnel stripped the wing to bare metal. The wing was then sprayed with <b>two</b> <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> primer paint and a coat of paint type filler. After the paint was dry, it was sanded in a chordwise direction, using sanding blocks, whose curvature matched the local surface curvature. This was repeated several times. Surface waviness was then measured and found to be no more than 0.005 inches. In flight, this configuration was found to have a profile drag representative of boundary layer transition at 60% of chord. This gave researchers an idea of what level of wing surface quality was required to actually get the benefits of laminar flow airfoils.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} work-in, the {{remainder}} of the stone floor was boarded, again using double-grooved boards with a metal tongue between them. The window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top four courses of brickwork continued. The top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks. The dust floor window had a reinforced concrete lintel cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted. The windshaft, the curb segments and fantail gearing were given <b>two</b> <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> red lead paint. A new finial for the cap was made from a piece of oak [...] long by [...] diameter. A start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and repointing with gauged mortar.|$|E
500|$|A 1937 {{survey by}} the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted a brass {{memorial}} plaque from 1609, erected by Richard Williams to his wife Marcelie Lloyd, daughter and co-heiress of David Lloyd of Llysdulas. [...] The plaque, which was previously in the old church, bears three shields, one with the coat of arms of Williams, another with Marcelie Lloyd's arms, and the middle one with the <b>two</b> <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> arms combined. [...] Below the shields, husband and wife are shown with their children (Anne, William and Griffith) kneeling in prayer on cushions. [...] The survey also noted a plain silver cup, dated 1711–1712. Other items of communion plate (an inscribed silver chalice, a plain silver paten and a plain silver flagon) were donated by Gwyn Gertrude Hughes in 1866. The church furniture (including the octagonal wooden pulpit and the choir stalls) dates from the 19th century, although the octagonal font was reused from the old church.|$|E

2500|$|The castle {{was built}} at the site in 1095 by Bohemond d'Hauteville, that elected it as their base before leaving for the first crusade in August 1096. The {{realization}} of the manor in Rende {{was the beginning of}} a larger project suggested years earlier by Robert Guiscard, Bohemond father, to build a defensive line in the valley of the Crati with fortresses in Bisignano, Montalto Uffugo, Rende and Cosenza. The peculiar morphology of the hill where was erected the [...] "Giant of Stone" [...] guaranteed an extremely easy posting to defend, and the steep slopes, which stand out upwards to form a wedge, saved such security that was believed unnecessary the creation of ditch and drawbridge. The castle was instead provided with small windows and many loopholes, which could be used bows and crossbows; also was built in the courtyard outside a huge cistern to collect rainwater that guaranteed a safe supply during sieges. Impassable walls (the base was more than two metres) guaranteed the protection of homes, churches, and other defensive structures, in particular the castle with the central tower and two other towers, placed on the sides. The three towers are the emblem of the town, probably their first appearance as a banner municipal was in 1222 for the inauguration of the cathedral of Cosenza in the presence of Frederick II. Still in public areas of the castle, you can admire <b>two</b> <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> arms belonging to two families in successive ownership of the castle: Magdalone (on the left side) and Alarcón de Mendoza(on the right side).
