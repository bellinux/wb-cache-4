5|$|One of {{the best}} sermons I have ever been privileged to hear was by the late Bishop of Winchester. Social exclusion? He said {{virtually}} that if one sheep from a flock of 100 goes missing, the good shepherd worries frantically about that single sheep until it is safely found. There are too many sheep, men, women and children, being marginalised. John the Baptist had the answer: why do we not? I remain concerned in these turbulent times, but <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> your patience. It has been my privilege {{to be able to}} speak in your Lordships' House.|$|E
5|$|Novick sent Cody's {{screenplay}} to {{his friend}} Jason Reitman; by the time Reitman had read halfway through the script, he felt {{that if he did}} not direct the film, he would regret {{it for the rest of}} his life. Initially, Reitman found it difficult to acquire the script, because his first film, <b>Thank</b> <b>You</b> <b>for</b> Smoking, had not been released yet, so he did not have any feature film credits. Other directors, including Jon Poll, were considered, but Reitman was chosen and he interrupted work on his own spec script in order to direct Juno. Cody says she had a cynical attitude when writing Juno ("I didn't ever think this film would be produced") and, indeed, the film was delayed by financial problems. After its controversial nature scared off a number of major studios, John Malkovich's production company, Mr. Mudd, took on the project. It was later brought to production company Mandate Pictures by co-producer Jim Miller.|$|E

25|$|Since its release, {{the film}} has had an {{influence}} on filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino, most notably his Kill Bill films; the character Gogo Yubari, played by Chiaki Kuriyama, resembles the character she plays in Battle Royale, Takako Chigusa. Battle Royale has also been referenced in the 2004 zombie comedy film Shaun of the Dead, where Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg made sure a big Battle Royale poster is prominently displayed in Shaun’s living room. Despite not being officially released in the United States for a long time, Battle Royale has often been referenced in American pop culture, ranging from Tarantino's films to the rock band The Flaming Lips' use of footage from the film as a backdrop for its Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots tour, along with references in Hollywood films such as Jason Reitman's <b>Thank</b> <b>You</b> <b>for</b> Smoking (2005) and Juno (2007) and American television shows such as Lost and Community.|$|E

25|$|The next affective {{emotion in}} this {{beginning}} stage is incompetence. Feeling incompetent can spring from multiple {{things in a}} relationship, but during {{the initial stages of}} infidelity a person can experience this on an increased level. Meaning, they begin to notice when their partner does not say <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> simple things, or they overthink any change made by the unfaithful partner. This can lead to a suspicious partner feeling like they cannot please their significant other and begin to feel incompetent in the relationship. When someone is having incompetent feelings due to someone else’s actions they begin to resent them creating a build-up and eventually an affective emotion outburst over something small. The faithful partner is not normally aware that their suspicion is the reason they feel incompetent in the relationship, and do not expect to be so irritated by the change of simple things; making it an affective response in this stage of infidelity (Miller, 2017). These unanticipated emotions could lead to more and multiple responses such as this one within the future of the initial stage of infidelity.|$|E
25|$|While {{filming the}} country mockumentary film Dill Scallion in 1998, Koechner befriended actor/comedian Dave 'Gruber' Allen, and {{eventually}} began performing as the comedy duo, The Naked Trucker & T-Bones Show, a live musical comedy act. The act became a hit at Hollywood clubs such as Largo, and Allen and Koechner {{were invited to}} open for Tenacious D. In 2007, Koechner and Allen created and starred together in a Naked Trucker & T-Bones Show sketch comedy series that ran for one season on Comedy Central. After his breakout role as Champ Kind in the 2004 comedy , Koechner began appearing frequently with larger supporting roles in many high-profile comedic films including , <b>Thank</b> <b>You</b> <b>for</b> Smoking, Waiting..., Semi-Pro, , and Extract. His first leading film role, as Coach Lambeau Fields in Fox Atomic's sports comedy, The Comebacks opened on October 19, 2007. More recently, Koechner reprised his role of Champ Kind for , co-starred in the horror-comedy Krampus, and received praise from critics for his dark turn in the 2014 black comedy Cheap Thrills. He currently co-stars in the CBS sitcom Superior Donuts and on the Comedy Central series Another Period.|$|E
25|$|That Dragon, Cancer is a {{video game}} created by Ryan and Amy Green, Josh Larson, and a small team under the name Numinous Games. The autobiographical game {{is based on the}} Greens' {{experience}} of raising their son Joel, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer at twelve months old, and though only given a short time to live, continued to survive for four more years before eventually succumbing to the cancer in March 2014. The game is designed to have the player experience the low and high moments of this period in the style of a point-and-click adventure game, using the medium's interactivity and immersion to relate the tale in ways that a film cannot. It was initially developed to relate Ryan and Amy's personal experience with Joel when they were uncertain of his health, but following his death, they reworked much of the game to memorialize and personalize their time and interactions with Joel for the player. Alongside the game, a documentary, <b>Thank</b> <b>You</b> <b>for</b> Playing, documenting both the last few years of Joel's life and the development of the game, has been filmed to be aired in 2016.|$|E
