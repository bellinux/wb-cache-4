5|$|With no {{government}} subsidy (s=0) the resulting equilibrium {{will be the}} standard Cournot outcome, {{as shown in the}} graph by the intersection of the best response functions. A subsidy however has the effect of shifting the domestic firm's best response function to the right. Because its output is subsidized, the domestic firm increases production. This in turn means that the foreign firm's best response is to cut output, although not proportionally (hence, <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>price</b> falls). In the new equilibrium domestic firm produces more and foreign firm produces less.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> stock <b>market</b> gives {{facilities}} to gain both from rising prices {{as well as}} from falling <b>prices.</b> In stock <b>markets,</b> there are only two forces namely the bulls and the bears.

Bears are those traders who always want <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> to go lower and gain profit from falling prices.

The District Valuer advised that the open market value of Cardiff City Hall was £3.5M. There was not enough information available for the District Valuer to make a decision. A bid of £2.5M was made by the Welsh Office on 14 November 1997, which was rejected on 21 November 1997.
