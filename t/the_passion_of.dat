The principle I count that from whence they flow, and the object that upon which they are pitched. To explain myself.|$|R

5|$|Adler {{wrote in}} his memoir that <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> his future wife Sonya Oberlander (and of her family) for theater, and their vision of what Yiddish theater could become, kept him in the {{profession}} despite his uncle's view. When she was cast by Rosenberg opposite Jacob Spivakovsky {{in the title role}} of Abraham Goldfaden's darkly comic operetta Breindele Cossack, she pulled strings so that the role of Guberman would be reassigned to Adler.|$|E

5|$|Gibson directed, co-wrote and {{produced}} <b>The</b> <b>Passion</b> <b>of</b> the Christ in 2004, a Biblical epic drama which chronicled <b>the</b> <b>Passion</b> <b>of</b> Jesus. On its release, the film garnered mixed reviews {{as well as}} notoriety for its graphic violence and alleged undertones of antisemitism from critics. Nevertheless, it grossed $370.3 million in the United States and $611.4 million worldwide, making it Gibson's highest-grossing film to date. Two years later he directed, co-wrote {{and produced}} Apocalypto, an epic adventure set in Central America depicting {{the last days of}} Mayan civilization before Spanish arrival in the 16th century. Gibson then took a ten-year hiatus from directing during which time he landed roles in Edge of Darkness (2010), Machete Kills (2013), The Expendables 3 (2014), and Blood Father (2016). He directed Hacksaw Ridge in 2016, a biographical war drama focusing on American World War II veteran Desmond Doss, the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor.

5|$|In his own time, Whitman {{attracted}} {{an influential}} coterie of disciples and admirers.

5|$|Representations of the Virgin and John the Evangelist flank Christ {{in small}} {{rectangular}} panels {{at either end}} of his outstretched arms. Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads on their hands and face inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the gilding surrounding the mourning saints is kept to a minimum. The size and positions of the figures are reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> Christ.|$|E
5|$|The {{front side}} of the left wing shows the Agony in the Garden and the Flagellation of Christ. The front {{side of the}} central wing {{represents}} the Crucifixion of Jesus with Saint Catherine and Saint Ursula. These two female figures may have been painted last {{as they are in}} a more distinctly Proto-Renaissance style than the rest. The front side of the right wing represents the Crowning with thorns and the Bearing of the Cross, all from <b>the</b> <b>Passion</b> <b>of</b> Jesus.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{parallels}} with Christian scripture in the novel. The life and death of Joe Christmas is reminiscent of <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> Christ, Lena and her fatherless child parallel Mary and Christ, and Byron Bunch acts as a Joseph figure. Christian imagery such as the urn, the wheel, and the shadow, can be found throughout.|$|E

The north and south walls of the cella, as well as the wall piers, bear frescoes of saints, including rare images of military saints on horseback. Murals of Saint Petka and Saint Nicholas were painted in the upper reaches of the narthex, in the south and the north tower respectively.|$|E
5|$|During the Paris {{exposition}} in May 1910, Gaudí spent {{a holiday}} in Vic, where he designed two basalt lampposts and wrought iron for the Plaça Major of Vic {{in honor of}} Jaume Balmes's centenary.

During this time he conceived {{the idea for the}} facade of <b>the</b> <b>Passion</b> <b>of</b> the Sagrada Família.

5|$|Most of {{the cast}} in Vampyr were not {{professional}} actors. Jan Hieronimko, who plays the village doctor, was found on a late night metro train in Paris. When approached {{to act in the}} film, Hieronimko stared blankly and did not reply. Hieronimko later contacted Dreyer's crew and agreed to join the film. Many of the other non-professional actors in the film were found in similar fashion in shops and cafes. The only professional actors in the film were Maurice Schutz, who plays the Lord of the Manor, and Sybille Schmitz, who plays his daughter Léone. Many crew members of Vampyr had worked with Dreyer on his previous film <b>The</b> <b>Passion</b> <b>of</b> Joan of Arc. Returning crew members included cinematographer Rudolph Maté and art director Hermann Warm.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Passion</b> <b>of</b> Martin Luther King was {{composed}} in 1968 following King's assassination. The Passion was first recorded in London in 1969, with Ezio Flagello, the composer's brother, as the bass baritone soloist. This performance was eventually released by Naxos American Classics in 2012. DePreist conducted the National Symphony Orchestra's first {{performance of the}} work at the Kennedy Center on February 19, 1974. Music critics drew comparisons to Johann Sebastian Bach's Passions, which recounts Jesus' death. The Oregon Symphony album was the first published recording of the work. Bazemore provided bass vocals, with additional vocals by the Portland Symphonic Choir, directed by Bruce Browne. The nine sections of the work are performed with a brief pause in between.|$|E
5|$|The album {{features}} {{two works}} by American composers, each with text from speeches by King: Joseph Schwantner's New Morning for the World ("Daybreak of Freedom") and Nicolas Flagello's cantata <b>The</b> <b>Passion</b> <b>of</b> Martin Luther King. Both works include performances by Raymond Bazemore, {{who serves as}} narrator on the former and provides bass vocals on the latter. On the album's release date, more than 30 United States radio stations broadcast the album version of Schwantner's composition to commemorate the civil rights leader. Proceeds from the album's sale benefited the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change. Produced by Michael Fine and engineered by Fred Vogler, the recording reached a peak position of number three on Billboard Classical Albums chart and remains the Oregon Symphony's best-selling album as of 2013.|$|E

Noah has been banned in United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Indonesia on religious grounds with other countries following suit.|$|E
