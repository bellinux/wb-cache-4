5|$|Sattler assists the park's game warden, Robert Muldoon, in {{a search}} for survivors, but they only find an injured Malcolm, before the Tyrannosaurus returns. Grant, Tim, and Lex take shelter in a treetop. Later, they {{discover}} the broken shells of dinosaur eggs. Grant concludes that <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> have been breeding, which occurred because of their frog DNA—West African bullfrogs can change their sex in a single-sex environment, allowing <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> to do so as well, proving Malcolm right.|$|E

5|$|Roger Stevens {{was working}} for the BBC as a film editor in the 1980s, and one morning, as he was {{travelling}} to work by train, he bumped into a BBC co-worker and they began to talk about Doctor Who episodes. The BBC projectionist mentioned that he had nine episodes of Doctor Who that Stevens could buy for £25. In the summer of 1981, Stevens bought The Space Museum episode one, The Abominable Snowmen episode two, The Moonbase episode four, Invasion of <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaurs</b> episode one, and three episodes of Carnival of Monsters. Stevens then contacted Ian Levine {{to find out what was}} missing from the BBC archive; Levine confirmed that The Abominable Snowmen episode two and Invasion of <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaurs</b> episode one were currently missing.|$|E
5|$|Stevens gave these prints to Levine, who {{returned}} The Abominable Snowmen to the BBC in February 1982, although he held back Invasion of <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaurs</b> from the BBC for a while. This was later {{returned to the}} BBC by Levine in June 1983, who then made a copy and returned the original to Levine.|$|E

5|$|The travel writer Paul Theroux {{mentions}} <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> in his 1989 novel My Secret History. The novel's narrator, Andre Parent, accidentally learns of his wife's infidelity {{when his}} young son, Jack, reveals {{that he has}} visited <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> {{in the company of}} his mother's 'friend' during Andre's prolonged absence gathering material for a travel book. The title story in Penelope Lively's 1991 novel Fanny and the Monsters is about a Victorian girl who visits the Crystal Palace dinosaurs and becomes fascinated by prehistoric creatures. The Lie Tree, a 2015 children's mystery-fantasy by Frances Hardinge features a dream scene with some of the dinosaur models coming to life.|$|E
5|$|Coprolites {{have been}} {{recorded}} in the Lameta Formation, {{and the presence of}} fungi in coprolites indicates that leaves were eaten by <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> which lived in a tropical or subtropical climate. Another scientific study of similarities in egg taxa suggested close phyletic relationships that supports the existence of a terrestrial connection between dinosaurian fauna in India and Europe during the Cretaceous, and between two Gondwanan areas, Patagonia and India.|$|E
5|$|Cultural {{depictions of}} dinosaurs have been {{numerous}} since the word dinosaur was coined in 1842. <b>The</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> featured in books, films, television programs, artwork, and other media {{have been used for}} both education and entertainment. The depictions range from the realistic, as in the television documentaries of the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, or the fantastic, as in the monster movies of the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
50|$|Danny and <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> is {{a popular}} children's book by Syd Hoff, first {{published}} by Harper & Brothers in 1958.

40|$|Notes {{from the}} Anthropocene is an {{experimental}} essay film that explores the cultural imagination of <b>the</b> <b>dinosaur</b> as a souvenir for 21 st century humans. The icon of <b>the</b> <b>dinosaur</b> shifts between narratives of extinction and human exceptionalism and power. The materiality of <b>the</b> <b>dinosaur</b> whether fossil or plastic toy has, through popular culture, become {{entrenched in the}} imaginary of oil extraction and fossil fuel production. Notes from the Anthropocene is a speculative iconological look at <b>the</b> <b>dinosaur,</b> and its resurrection in the Anthropocene, the proposed geological era where humans are the dominating force on the planet, and its symbolic relationship to an increasing ambivalence towards the natural world...|$|R
5|$|For four years, Episode 1 of Invasion of <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaurs</b> was {{the only}} Pertwee episode to be entirely missing from the archives, until a {{black-and-white}} 16mm copy was returned to the Corporation in June 1983. The story was released on DVD with a partially recolourised version of Episode 1, alongside a higher-quality monochrome transfer of the episode, in The UNIT Files box set. With one exception, archival holdings from Death to the Daleks Episode 2 onwards are complete on the original broadcast videotapes.|$|E
5|$|Hawkins benefited {{greatly from}} the public's {{reaction}} to <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs,</b> {{which was so}} strong it allowed {{for the sale of}} sets of small versions of the dinosaur models, priced at £30 for educational use. But the building of the models was costly (having cost around £13,729) and in 1855, the Crystal Palace Company cut Hawkins's funding. Several planned models were never made, while those half finished were scrapped, despite protest from sources including the Sunday newspaper, The Observer.|$|E
5|$|Pterosaurs {{have been}} a staple of popular culture {{for as long as}} their cousins <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs,</b> though they are usually not {{featured}} as prominently in films, literature or other art. Additionally, while the depiction of dinosaurs in popular media has changed radically in response to advances in paleontology, a mainly outdated picture of pterosaurs has persisted since the mid 20th century.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Army {{is led by}} {{an ancient}} monster, Triple Neck Demon (Majin Mitsu Kubi). It is a three-headed dinosaur/dragon. One head of this ancient beast spits fire, one poison gas and one a bolt of energy. Triple Neck Demon's chief aides are the human worshipers Devil Hat (Akuma Hatto) and Princess Meza (Ōjo Meza). Devil Hat makes <b>the</b> <b>dinosaur</b> shaped robots for <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Army and uses his hat like a weapon. Princess Meza is an expert at disguises {{and serves as a}} spy. Under these three are <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Army Mecha, Dinosaur Army Hitmen (human assassins) and the reptile headed Dragon Face Soldiers.|$|R
50|$|Saturn Bomberman utilises Dinosaur helpers, {{which are}} {{initially}} found as eggs released upon {{the destruction of}} a soft block. Dinosaurs come in three levels: babies (the weakest), adolescents, and adults (<b>the</b> strongest). <b>Dinosaurs</b> can only take one hit no matter how large they are. If a player is riding a dinosaur when this happens, <b>the</b> <b>dinosaur</b> takes <b>the</b> hit instead of the player. As powerups are collected, a special meter {{at the top of the}} screen slowly builds up. Once this meter is full, <b>the</b> <b>dinosaur</b> will grow one level, from baby to adolescent or adolescent to adult. However, in battle mode this system works differently. Whenever a player collects an egg while riding on a <b>dinosaur,</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinosaur</b> will grow. <b>The</b> player can jump off of <b>the</b> <b>dinosaur</b> at any time.|$|R

5|$|Rubidium and caesium {{are often}} used in atomic clocks. Caesium atomic clocks are {{extraordinarily}} accurate; if a clock had been made {{at the time of}} <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs,</b> it would be off by less than four seconds (after 80 million years). For that reason, caesium atoms are used as the definition of the second. Rubidium ions {{are often used}} in purple fireworks, and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry.|$|E
5|$|Spinosaurus sails were unusual, {{although}} other dinosaurs, namely the ornithopod Ouranosaurus, which lived {{a few million}} years earlier in the same general region as Spinosaurus, and the South American sauropod Amargasaurus, might have developed similar structural adaptations of their vertebrae. The sail may be an analog of the sail of the Permian synapsid Dimetrodon, which lived before <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> even appeared, produced by convergent evolution.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, chroma dots {{were used}} to restore the colour to Episodes 2–4, 6, and 7 of The Ambassadors of Death and episodes 2–6 of The Mind of Evil. Episode 1 of Invasion of <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaurs</b> {{presented}} a unique challenge, in that the chroma dots only contained red and green colour filter information, requiring that the blue filter to be added manually. Given the rough result, the DVD includes both the reconstructed colour and the black-and-white version.|$|E
50|$|Versus mode has {{the player}} {{going up against}} a second player. The players can choose <b>the</b> <b>dinosaur</b> and <b>the</b> arena. If the second player chooses <b>the</b> same <b>dinosaur</b> <b>the</b> skin changes to an alternative.|$|R
