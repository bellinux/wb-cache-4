50|$|Since 2014 it is {{possible}} to torque tighten bolts without the use of a reaction arm, and thus without pinch point. This is a great break-through in the industry. Reaction arm free <b>torqueing</b> {{is possible}} due to the usage of a reaction washer. The knurled side of the washer hold on to the construction/flange and the bolt or nut turn over a smooth and through-hardened surface. The reaction washer will become a stationary object underneath the nut, eliminating the use of reaction arms.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, for cheaper locks, {{the disks}} can be {{bypassed}} by inserting a screwdriver or similar <b>torqueing</b> device, causing the retainer to pop {{off and the}} inside 'guts' of the lock to spill out. The same effect can be created by turning a torque tool in the lock until the end-cap pops off. After this, cheap plastic locks can be turned by hand, pulled out with pliers, or deformed by heating - causing the lock to open, or completely fall apart. More expensive disk tumbler locks use metal parts that can defeat this technique or make it more difficult.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{solution to the}} problem is to have two joined flywheels spinning synchronously in opposite directions. They would have a total angular momentum of zero and no gyroscopic effect. A problem with this solution is that when the difference between the momentum of each flywheel is anything other than zero the housing of the two flywheels would exhibit torque. Both wheels must be maintained at the same speed to keep the angular velocity at zero. Strictly speaking, the two flywheels would exert a huge <b>torqueing</b> moment at the central point, trying to bend the axle. However, if the axle were sufficiently strong, no gyroscopic forces would have a net effect on the sealed container, so no torque would be noticed.|$|E

30|$|Based on the {{simulation}} results, the authors propose the following recommendations {{to achieve a}} tooth movement without undesired tipping in clinical settings. To prevent tipping due to a play between the archwire and the bracket slots, the archwire should be twisted initially so that contact is just made between the archwire and the bracket slots. It is necessary to predict tipping direction and twist the archwire in its opposite direction. Tipping due to an elastic deflection can be prevented by using an initially prebent archwire or <b>torqueing</b> (third-order bend). But an optimal amount of the prebend or the <b>torqueing</b> is unknown before treatment. Movement pattern of the entire dentition can be controlled by the force direction in respect {{to the center of}} resistance (CR) of the entire dentition [7]. But a correct position of the CR in a patient’s dentition is uncertain. For these reasons, an optimal condition for desired movement cannot be selected before treatment. In such situations, when undesired tipping is observed in clinical treatments, its causes should be identified at first. Then, reasonable methods should be taken to prevent the tipping in accordance with the causes.|$|E

30|$|It {{was found}} that tipping of the {{anterior}} teeth was due to three causes, a play of the archwire-bracket slot, an elastic deflection of the archwire, and a rotation of the entire dentition. Among these three causes, only the tipping due to an elastic deflection of archwire can be prevented by using an inversely prebent archwire or <b>torqueing</b> (third-order bend). When using such archwires, only tipping due to elastic deflection decreased, but the other types of tipping are left. If using a prebent archwire or a third-order bend to diminish tipping of the incisor caused by a play, the other teeth will be tipped as a reaction against the upright direction of the incisor.

40|$|This {{project is}} a kind of doingmovingthinking: a close study of iconic American dancer/choreographer Deborah Hays choreography and {{practice}} through my particular dancing experience of her solo At Once. The resulting experiential poetics illuminates both the implicit critique of an instrumental/rational paradigm and also the ethical implications of the particular relationality enacted in Hays work. I characterize Hays work as a radical communication practice, one that moves language through the body in a dynamic <b>torqueing</b> process that both gathers toward and unravels from the edges of meaningfulness in a process of perception. I work at the interdisciplinary intersection of dance, performance, somatics and cultural studies, and my thinking draws substantially on Maurice Merleau-Pontys phenomenological philosophy and language. Aspiring to a balanced integration of moving and writing, of practice and theory, I follow a performance studies approach, attempting, as characterized by performance scholar Dwight Conquergood: to live betwixt and between theory and theatricality, paradigms and practices, critical reflection and creative accomplishment (318). Through personal daily practice and performance of Hays work allied with close description, I apply my devised method of emergent choreographic analysis to Hays choreography and practice. This analysis, conducted from inside the practice of the work, reveals how Hays complex and distinctly linguistic choreography operates as a constructed situation for the practice of perception and that, in performance, this practice moves language through the body in a dynamic <b>torqueing</b> process that engenders a unique lived experience of paradoxical simultaneity. I coin the term somatic anacrusis to articulate this underlying processual phenomenon. Reconsidering the dimension of relationality in Hays work, I re-frame somatic anacrusis as a pre-relational pre-disposing, a kind of suspended or unconsummated relationality. Feminist philosopher Luce Irigarays thinking helps illuminate the ethical implications of Hays work as a practice of perception that opens a new way toward the other. I conclude by appropriating Hays own rhetorical interrogative strategy what if? What if somatic anacrusis offers a possible answer to Irigarays call for a new way to approach the other that respects fundamental difference and yet allows encounter...|$|E

There were 2 -factor interaction effects on torque – surface*direction, surface*diameter and diameter*direction for the cylinders; and direction*width for the flanges, indicating that the change in torque over one factor is not independent of all other factors...|$|E
30|$|By {{observing the}} tooth {{movement}} especially in Fig.  2 c, {{we can understand}} that bowing caused by elastic deflection of the archwire was another reason for lingual tipping of the incisors. This tipping occurred under a condition where a moment was applied from the archwire to the incisor, and therefore, {{it was a kind}} of controlled tipping. The tipping angle of the incisor was greater than the maximum rotation angle Δθ in each archwire size. The difference between both angles is due to the elastic deflection of the archwire, which increases by decreasing the archwire size. In Fig.  2, the tipping angle due to the elastic deflection becomes 4.1 ° (=[*] 6.4 – 2.3 °), 6.9 ° (=[*] 16.7 – 9.8 °), and 7.6 ° (=[*] 25.6 – 18.0 °) when decreasing the archwire size. Elastic deflection of the archwire affected individual teeth differently. In the central incisor, an elastic deflection caused lingual tipping, and it was added to that produced by the play. As a result, lingual tipping of the central incisor became remarkable. In the canine, crown distal tipping was caused by an elastic deflection of the archwire. In the molars, the influence of elastic deflection was small. In all kinds of tooth, tipping due to the elastic deflection can be prevented by using an inversely prebent archwire or <b>torqueing</b> (third-order bend) of archwire [13].|$|E

Bolt tension is determined by dividing the torque on the screw by a k value multiplied by the thread diameter of the bolt. The k value is a factor that accounts for friction in the system. A common value used for k for a non-lubricated screw is 0. 2.

Peri-apical radiographs and standardized photographs were taken to determine bone loss and soft tissue changes. Plaque and bleeding levels were assessed. Patients’ satisfaction was measured using the OHIP- 14 questionnaire. Results After 1 year, all implants survived and mean bone loss was 1. 20 mm, with no significant changes after 6 months. Plaque levels were low and no significant changes were observed. Bleeding levels decreased during the initial 3 months, but were constant thereafter. Before final <b>torqueing</b> was performed after 6 months, 4 cases of screw loosening occurred. Also, 1 crown had a piece of porcelain chipped off. Patients reported an overall increase in well-being. A mean mid-facial recession of 0. 37 mm was observed.

Index tests were performed for the soil samples collected at each of these sites. Relationships between the torque ratio (the measured torque divided by the corrected SPT blow count) and unit side resistance versus normalized SPT blow count (N 1, 60) and normalized CPT cone resistance (qc, 1) were explored for these soils with the unit side resistance versus the estimated undrained shear strength was explored for saturated clay soils. Reliable correlations based on the torque ratio were not achieved based on the data collected for the different soils tested. However, high coefficients of determination were obtained for the normalized equations developed for clayey soils and saturated non-plastic silt. Relatively low coefficients of determination were obtained for saturated and unsaturated sandy soils. The low coefficients of determination values are attributed to the small population dataset for sandy soils {{and the difficulty of}} adequately determining the degree of saturation for unsaturated non-plastic soil types due to the soil structure destruction with sampling. Overall, {{it was found that the}} relationships are strong for clay and saturated non-plastic silt and it is recommended that further data be collected to continue to strengthen all relationships, especially for sand and unsaturated non-plastic silt. ...|$|E
