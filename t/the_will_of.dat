5|$|During the campaign, Taylor was {{attacked}} by Democratic opponents because of his party's support from black voters and its ties to big business, including the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. They also charged that Governor Bradley had run a corrupt administration. Republicans answered with charges of factionalism and use of political machinery by Democrats. In particular, they derided the Goebel Election Law, which Taylor claimed subverted <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> the people.|$|E
5|$|Even liberal {{senators}} were agitated by {{the proposed}} changes, fearing their own lands would be confiscated. Senators arranged for other tribunes {{to oppose the}} reforms. Tiberius then appealed to the people, and argued that a tribune who opposes <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> the people in favour of the rich is not a true tribune. The senators were left with only one constitutional response – to threaten prosecution after Tiberius's term as a tribune ended. This necessitated Tiberius to stand for a second term.|$|E
5|$|Factors {{affecting}} one's {{ability to}} delay gratification {{depend on whether}} the delay contingency is self-imposed (delay can be terminated at <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> the person waiting) or externally imposed by another person, institution or circumstance. When the contingency is self-imposed, the physical presence of the reward seems to aid in delaying gratification. On the other hand, when the delay is externally imposed, children {{are not able to}} wait as long when the reward is present, suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances.|$|E
50|$|According to Rousseau, {{by joining}} {{together}} into civil society through {{the social contract}} and abandoning their claims of natural right, individuals can both preserve themselves and remain free. This is because submission to the authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general <b>will</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people as a whole guarantees individuals against being subordinated to <b>the</b> <b>wills</b> <b>of</b> others and also ensures that they obey themselves because they are, collectively, {{the authors of the}} law.|$|R

The analysis of the empirical study results shows that appraisal {{of the role of}} emotional experience depends on <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>will</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individuals under study. A methodical technique has been applied, by which the indices of the emotional and volitional sphere are considered throughout different life periods of the individuals under study. Types of interrelation between <b>the</b> indices <b>of</b> <b>will</b> and emotions are highlighted which illustrate certain variants of the influence of emotional experience on <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> personality...|$|R

5|$|Kierkegaard {{argues that}} Hegel's {{philosophy}} dehumanized life by denying personal freedom and choice through the neutralization of the 'either/or'. The dialectic structure of becoming renders existence far too easy, in Hegel's theory, because conflicts are eventually mediated and disappear automatically through a natural process that requires no individual choice {{other than a}} submission to <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> the Idea or Geist. Kierkegaard saw this as a denial of true selfhood and instead advocated the importance of personal responsibility and choice-making.|$|E
