This is our statement to this rusted world, to these wasted dreams and plastic reality with real life and unreal people. We're sick of mediocrity in their bodies who walk empty streets without any real purpose. This album talks about them, about their sorrow, mistakes and inner demons. Without them we do not exist and without us they are nothing. This is about something real. It's about this fallen mankind. This world has become occupied, surrounded and unhealthy. We {{do not agree with}} this worlds systems of values. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>world</b> without values, without inner boundaries that confront served mediocrity. We're so fucking sick of it all, and want to live in some better place, and really feel our childhood energy. So we named our album 'El Conquistadors' (proper Spanish title would be 'El Conquistador') but we want for those smart-ass motherfucking self-masturbating people to say that we're wrong, to say that they know better and to hear from their empty minds what do {{we need to do to}} live happy mediocrity life. And we're not even going to ask you to listen to this album, no - if you see it just run away from it, hate it, laugh at it, be the one of El Conquistadors who crush worlds without trying to feel them. Be the other one inside you, get stupid, lazy and un-civilized. But be warned - it will be too late to come to your senses in the end....." ...|$|E

Although the depletion layer, most of charge are generated by an induction, and the charge collection efficiency achieves 50 to 60 %, which is determined by the detector thickness and the carrier drift length (Ld = 120 μm). The energy resolution is obtained by 25 %. We measured actual backgrounds from 115 In beta decay, and also the effect of radiative Bremsstrahlung from those betas. No significant event was found in the measurement and the radiation such as Bremsstrahlung from InP detector could be negligible...|$|E
