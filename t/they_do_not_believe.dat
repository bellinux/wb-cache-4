5|$|The {{lives of}} Elves only endure {{as the world}} endures. It is said in the Second Prophecy of Mandos {{that at the end}} of time the Elves will join the other Children of Ilúvatar in singing the Second Music of the Ainur. However it is disputable whether the Prophecy is canon, and the {{published}} Silmarillion states that only Men shall participate for certain in the Second Music, and that the ultimate fate of the Elves is unknown. However, <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that Eru will abandon them to oblivion.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{introduces}} his illegitimate son, Donald (Michael Benjamin Washington), to the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff. Liz and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{suspect that}} Donald is embezzling from Tracy as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that Donald is twenty-one years old, which Donald claims to be. Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden), Liz's assistant, obtains Donald's birth certificate {{and gives it}} to Liz and Pete; the two learn that Donald is forty years of age, thus confirming their suspicions about him. Liz tells Tracy about this, but Tracy knew all about Donald's scam, explaining {{he decided to go}} along with it because Donald was putting all of the money into a dojo and doing good for the community.|$|E
5|$|Clement {{begins the}} fourth {{book with a}} belated {{explanation}} of the disorganized nature of the work, and gives {{a brief description of}} his aims for the remaining three or four books. The fourth book focuses on martyrdom. While all good Christians should be unafraid of death, Clement condemns those who actively seek out a martyr's death, arguing {{that they do not have}} sufficient respect for God's gift of life. He is ambivalent whether any believing Christian can become a martyr by virtue of the manner of their death, or whether martyrdom is reserved for those who have lived exceptional lives. Marcionites cannot become martyrs, because <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in the divinity of God the Father – their sufferings are in vain. There is then a digression to the subject of theological epistemology. According to Clement, there is no way of empirically testing the existence of God the Father, because the Logos has revelatory, not analysable meaning, although Christ was an object of the senses. God had no beginning, and is the universal first principle.|$|E

25|$|The Memorial, held after sunset, {{includes}} a {{talk on the}} meaning of the celebration and the circulation among the audience of unadulterated red wine and unleavened bread. Jehovah's Witnesses believe the bread symbolizes Jesus Christ's body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine symbolizes his blood which redeems from sin. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in transubstantiation or consubstantiation. Because many congregations have no members who claim to be anointed, it is common for no one to partake of the bread and wine.|$|E
25|$|Although {{scientists}} favor biological {{models for}} the cause of sexual orientation, <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that it is the result of any one factor. They generally believe that it is determined by biological and environmental factors; they state that most people's sexual orientation is determined at an early age, and sexual orientation development involves a complex interplay between nature and nurture. The biological factors are genetic and hormonal, both of which affect the fetal development of the brain, while environmental factors may be sociological, psychological, or involve the early uterine environment. Scientists generally do not believe that sexual orientation is a matter of choice.|$|E
25|$|Mormonism and Christianity have {{a complex}} theological, historical, and sociological relationship. Mormons express the doctrines of Mormonism using {{standard}} biblical terminology, and have similar {{views about the}} nature of Jesus' atonement, bodily resurrection, and Second Coming as traditional Christianity. Nevertheless, most Mormons do not accept the Trinitarian views of orthodox Nicene Christianity, codified in the Nicene and Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creeds of 325 and 381. Though Mormons consider the Bible as scripture, <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in biblical inerrancy. They have also adopted additional scriptures, including the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Mormons practice baptism and celebrate the Eucharist, but they also participate in religious rituals not practiced by traditional Christianity.|$|E

25|$|On June 14, 2013, Jalisco {{authorities}} {{confirmed that}} they were officially opening an investigation to locate Tobares. Argentine consular officials stated that they had filed a formal request to Jalisco authorities on June 10 and were collaborating with them. Tobares' friends told officials that {{he was planning to}} visit Sayulita and Tepic, Nayarit. Investigators in Mexico and Argentina discarded two leads that were initially thought plausible. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that Tobares purposely decided to cut ties with his family and friends to disappear on his own will. Tobares was looking for a new job opportunity in Guadalajara (he had his passport and other legal documentation ready), which made investigators think that it was unlikely that Tobares would go into hiding or cut communication with those close to him.|$|E
25|$|Despite of {{politicians}} talks, Israeli public {{does not seem}} to share the same concern about the Iranian nuclear deal. Or rather, they do acknowledge that nuclear capability in Iran is a threat and <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that the new agreement proposed by Obama will solve the situation. However, in recent polls, when asked to rank what is the major threat to Israeli security, Iran's nuclear power figured only in second position. Hamas and Hezbollah's terrorism is what concerns the most. Also when asked about internal issues, what figured as the highest concern for Israel's stability was the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians, not the Iranian nuclear threat. So, eventhough the population shares with the politicians the same concern about the nuclear threat, they do not think that should be the countrie's first issue to deal with.|$|E
25|$|In the Warriors universe, {{there are}} four Clans of feral cats that live in a forest: ThunderClan, RiverClan, WindClan, and ShadowClan. Each Clan is adapted to its own types of prey and members usually possess (or are taught) special skills which suit the territory's terrain. The authors based the forest on the New Forest in {{southern}} England. In addition to the New Forest, Loch Lomond, the Scottish Highlands, and the Forest of Dean inspired the fictional locales in the novel. BloodClan {{is a group of}} stray city cats introduced in The Darkest Hour. This group of cats is not considered to be a true Clan because <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in the warriors' spiritual ancestors, StarClan, or the warrior code, a set of rules followed by all Clan cats. BloodClan cats are thus seen as a group of rogues (non-Clan cats who do not respect the Clan cats' rules).|$|E

5000|$|Jesus says he {{will tell}} them if they answer him one question. [...] "John's baptism — was it from heaven, or from men? Tell me!" [...] (30) The priests are then trapped. Mark implies that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in John, so that if they answer from heaven people will ask why <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> John. If <b>they</b> answer from men, {{they would be in}} {{conflict}} with the people, who did believe in John. They therefore refuse to answer and accordingly so does Jesus. This allows him to make the priests look bad and incompetent and also allows him to imply to the people that his authority is from God without saying it.|$|R

When match organisers attempted to speak to the Napoli fans, accompanied by their midfielder Marek Hamšík, they were [...] "pelted with flares and smoke bombs".|$|E
500|$|Raëlians do {{not believe}} in reincarnation as {{dictated}} by mystical writings because <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that an ethereal soul exists free of physical confinement. Instead the Raëlians think that advanced supercomputers of the Elohim are right now recording the memories and DNA of human beings. When Elohim release this information for the coming resurrection, people would be brought back from the dead and the judgments upon them would be realized based on actions in their past life. People excluded from physical recreation would include those who achieved nothing positive but were not evil. [...] Claude Vorilhon expressed an interest in cloning Hitler for war trials and retroactive punishment. [...] Raël also mentioned cloning as the solution to terrorism by suicide attacks, as the perpetrators {{would not be able to}} escape punishment by killing themselves if the Elohim recreated them after their attacks.|$|E
