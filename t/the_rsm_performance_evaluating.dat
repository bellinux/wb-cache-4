40|$|This paper studies <b>the</b> use of <b>RSM</b> (response surface methodology) to {{optimize}} the performance parameters and exhaust emissions of a SI (spark ignition) engine which operates with ethanol–gasoline blends of 5 %, 7. 5 %, 10 %, 12. 5 % and 15 % called E 5, E 7. 5, E 10, E 12. 5 and E 15. In the experiments, the engine ran at various speeds for each test fuel and 45 different conditions were constructed. In comparison with gasoline fuel, the brake power, engine torque, increased using ethanol blends, and the bsfc (brake specific fuel consumption) decreased as well. Moreover, the concentration of CO and HC in the exhaust pipe decreased by introducing ethanol blends, but CO 2 and NOx emissions increased. Optimization of independent variables was performed using the desirability approach of <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> (response surface methodology) {{with the goal of}} minimizing emissions and maximizing of performance parameters. The experiments were designed using a statistical tool known as DoE (design of experiments) based on RSM. Engine-operating parameters were optimized using the Desirability approach of <b>RSM.</b> <b>The</b> <b>performance</b> parameters for different biofuel–gasoline blends were found close to gasoline, and emission characteristics of the engine improved significantly. An engine speed of 3000 rpm and a blend of 10 % bioethanol and 90 % gasoline (E 10) were found to be optimal values. The results of this study revealed that at optimal input parameters, the values of the brake power, Torque, bsfc, and CO, CO 2, HC, NOx were found to be 35. 26 (kW), 103. 66 (Nm), 0. 25 (kg/kW hr), 3. 5 (%Vol.), 12. 8 (%Vol.), 136. 6 (ppm) and 1300 (ppm) respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} {{use of the}} National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Regional Spectral Model (RSM) for downscaling seasonal {{tropical cyclone}} (TC) activity was analyzed here. <b>The</b> NCEP <b>RSM</b> with horizontal resolution of 50 km, was used to downscale the ECHAM 4. 5 Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM) simulations forced with observed sea surface temperature (SST) over the western North Pacific. An ensemble of ten runs for June–November 1994 and 1998 was studied. The representation of the TCs is much improved compared to the low-resolution forcing AGCM, but the TCs are not as intense as observed ones, as <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> horizontal resolution is not sufficiently high. The large-scale fields of <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> are examined and compared to both the AGCM and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis.

40|$|Today roller-screw {{mechanisms}} (<b>RSM)</b> are <b>the</b> most prospective motion converters from rotary to linear type. RSM {{manufacturers have}} suggested their {{design in the}} way, similar to the rolling bearings, in static and dynamic load ratings. The latter means that during long operations the main criterion of <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> working capacity is fatigue spalling. However, this approach does not permit to consider temporal changes {{of the most critical}} <b>performance</b> parameters of <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> (such as <b>the</b> axial play, the efficiency factor, the axial stiffness, the accuracy, the starting torque force for zero lash RSMs, etc.) through calculations. The abovementioned method was not perfect, because the choice of the main criterion of RSM working capacity was wrong. The article proves that wear-resistance is the main criterion of <b>RSM</b> working capacity. <b>The</b> proof is <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> efficiency factor equal to 80 - 88 % on the average. The power loss occurs because of overcoming a sliding friction between multiple (from 300 to 1000) interfacing turns of thread on the screw and the rollers {{as well as on the}} rollers and the nut. That is why <b>the</b> <b>RSMs</b> are <b>the</b> screwtype rolling mechanisms with an essential portion of sliding friction. High-accuracy measurements taken using the device called a form-tracer for threaded pieces permitted to determine the essential changes on the profiles of turns of threads on the rollers (a straight-line portion appeared on the radial profile); these changes could emerge only from wear. Besides, the length of this portion increased with <b>the</b> increasing <b>RSM</b> operation time. <b>The</b> JSC “Moskvich” has examined <b>the</b> <b>RSMs,</b> which have been put out of operation after completing their service life as parts of robot welding machines. There were no traces of fatigue spalling found on the threaded surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> parts, while <b>the</b> sizes of the straight-line portions on the turns of the roller threads were much bigger than they were during the measurements after the initial period of operation. Therefore, it is relevant to conduct a research for developing <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> wear-resistance calculation methods. The aim and objectives of such a research have been established, and the initial object – a non-nut type roller-screw mechanism of simple design and kinematics – has been chosen. By now a whole range of theoretical studies have been conducted entirely, or partially, a test rig has been designed and manufactured, and the metrological examination methods have been developed for threaded surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> parts...|$|R
