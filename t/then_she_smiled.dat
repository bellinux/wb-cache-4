60|$|Mary {{struggled}} a moment, <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> with tender archness.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Joseph sighed over Jimmy's worn jacket {{which she}} was mending. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiled.</b>|$|E
60|$|Gudrun {{looked at}} him, {{to see if}} it were ill-meant. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> at him.|$|E

6000|$|<b>Then</b> saft <b>she</b> <b>smiled,</b> {{and said}} to him, [...] "O what ill hae I done?" [...] He took her in his armis twa, [...] And threw her o'er the linn.|$|R
60|$|She paused {{while she}} sat down, and <b>then</b> once more <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> up at him.|$|R
60|$|He {{handed it}} to her, and she drained its contents. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> up at him weakly.|$|E
60|$|Grace {{started a}} little at the vivacity of my manner, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiled,</b> though I still thought sadly.|$|E
60|$|Virginia started. And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> as {{she looked}} at the honest, alert, and {{squarely}} built gentleman beside her.|$|E
6000|$|... "They stops {{when they}} sees me, an' the lady she bows and says 'good-mornin',' an' <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiles,</b> very {{pleasant}}, an' asks if I was a-livin' here, an' when I said I was, {{she says she}} was too, for the present, an' what was my name. I had half a mind to say the Earl-ess Random, but she was so pleasant and sociable that I didn't like to seem to be makin' fun, an' so I said I was Mrs. De Henderson.|$|R
60|$|Don Jer. <b>Then,</b> when <b>she</b> <b>smiles,</b> you'll see {{a little}} dimple in one cheek only; a beauty it is certainly, yet, you shall not say which is prettiest, the cheek with the dimple, or the cheek without.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who is it?" [...] <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> curtseyed, <b>smiling</b> at him drolly, and put {{her hand}} upon her breast. [...] "Something for you! What on earth can you want that I can do for you?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{girl looked}} quickly up into Chandler's clear, {{pleasant}} countenance. Her eyes twinkled once very brightly, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> ingenuously.|$|E
60|$|As I {{opened the}} gate I felt an odd chill of {{positive}} fear. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> as if I had spoken my thought.|$|E
6000|$|For {{a moment}} she said nothing; <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiled.</b> 'For you, I am very sorry. But you must {{remember}} that I possess the original!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And d'ye know, on {{my faith}} I think Burnett'd have done it, only she pipes up, sweet and pert as you please: 'Mr. Auctioneer, will you kindly {{proceed with the}} sale in the {{customary}} manner? I've other business to attend to, and I can't afford to wait all night on men who don't know their own minds.' And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiles</b> at Burnett, as well--you know, one of those fetching smiles, and damme if Burnett doesn't begin singing out: 'Goin', goin', goin'--last bid--goin', goin' for fifty-five sovereigns--goin', goin', gone--to you, Miss--er--what name, please?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> got up, <b>smiling,</b> and {{advanced}} to meet Chisholm and Flora, {{who came up}} the garden path.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! famously--just as all girls do, you know. She blushes, and {{sometimes}} <b>she</b> looks vexed; <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiles,</b> and puts up her lip, and says 'Nonsense!' and 'What folly!' 'Rupert, I'm surprised at you!' {{and all that}} sort of stuff, which deceives nobody, you'll understand, not even her poor, simple, silly brother. But, Miles, I must quit you now, for I have an engagement to accompany a party to the theatre, and {{was on my way to}} join them when we met. Cooper plays, and you know what a lion he is; one would not wish to lose a syllable of his Othello." ...|$|R
60|$|He had muttered {{the word}} half aloud and she {{suddenly}} opened her eyes. At first she seemed bewildered. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> and sat up.|$|E
60|$|She drew a sigh {{as if all}} her cares {{and duties}} dropped from her, <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> and a comprehending light sparkled in her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's so {{long since}} the war I've {{forgotten}} so many things," [...] she said, wonderingly. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> sweetly. [...] "Dare, I'm proud of you." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> at last <b>she</b> <b>smiled,</b> {{and there}} was in her eyes a look of superhuman love. Dr. Coutras was startled by it, and amazed. And he was awed. He found nothing to say.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor David!" [...] she said, {{making much}} of his hand {{as if she had}} hurt it. But David Gemmell's was too simple a face to oppose to her pitying eyes, and {{presently}} she let his hand slip from her and stood regarding him curiously. He had to look another way, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> even <b>smiled,</b> a little forlornly.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Maturin herself, who {{had been}} moved and excited as she gazed at Janet, was taken by surprise. A few moments elapsed before she could gather herself to reply, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> managed to <b>smile.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mary {{was silent}} for fully a minute; <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> archly, as girls will smile when certain {{thoughts}} cross their playful imaginations, and continued the discourse.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> at me--a very {{dazzling}} smile, {{which showed}} all her white teeth, and which seemed somehow to become reflected in her dark blue eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, thanks!" [...] {{said the}} girl sharply. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> maliciously. [...] "I daresay mother would, though; she’s fond of poking her nose into other people’s business." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{electric}} bell rang softly from outside, and the orchestra commenced to play. Lady Ruth rose {{and looked at}} herself in the mirror. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> turned and <b>smiled</b> at her visitor. The pallor of her face was no longer unnatural. She was a wonderful woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not that way! Keep {{your hand}} firm and your arm stiff," [...] she said, and putting her foot on his hand, sprang to the saddle. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> turned and <b>smiled.</b> [...] "You have pluck, {{but you had}} better get back on board and change your clothes." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the morning}} when Aiden goes to school, he {{complains}} about losing his soldier toy. Then Jim mentions to Melinda about {{a problem with the}} plumbing and Melinda gets angry for it being her job to call a plumber which causes confusion between both Jim and Aiden. The next scene shows Melinda in Delia's office. Delia asks her how is everything at the store, and Melinda answers that she hates Same As It Never Was and never wants to go there again. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> suddenly <b>smiles</b> and says everything is alright.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{little girl}} and boy deserve such playmates, if mortal {{children}} ever did!" [...] said the mother to herself; and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> again at her own motherly pride.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I do. It {{does seem}} {{now that we}} have been imprudent." [...] <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> as she {{completed}} her speech. [...] "There had better be no engagement between us." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{gave me a}} quick look, {{and again}} I caught that dancing, tremulous light and {{something}} more in her eyes. But it was only for the moment. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>smiled.</b>|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> drove away, <b>smiling</b> {{and waving}} {{her hand to}} the old lady at her window; but {{the last thing she}} saw as she left the well-beloved lane, was David going slowly up the path, with Kitty close beside him, talking busily. If she had heard the short {{dialogue}} between them, the sight would have been less bitter, for Kitty said: ...|$|R
60|$|Yet all {{the time}} she wanted, and stormily knew she wanted, to be fleeing to the boy Milt, her mate; to run away with him, hand in hand, {{discovering}} all the colored world, laughing at life, not afraid of losing dignity. In fear of Jeff's very kindliness and honor, she jerked her hand free. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> tried to <b>smile</b> like a clever fencer.|$|R
6000|$|Yva {{glanced at}} me, {{and in her}} eyes I read {{tenderness}} and solicitude, also something of inquiry. It seemed to me {{as though she were}} wondering what I should do under circumstances that might, or would, arise, and in some secret fashion of which I was but half conscious, drawing an answer from my soul. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> turned, and, <b>smiling</b> in her dazzling way, said: ...|$|R
