5|$|Doctors {{initially}} told Kennedy {{the tumor}} was inoperable, but he looked around for other opinions and decided on <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>aggressive</b> and exhausting course of treatment possible. On June 2, 2008, Kennedy underwent brain surgery at Duke University Medical Center {{in an attempt to}} remove as much of the tumor as possible. The 3½-hour operation, conducted by Dr. Allan Friedman while Kennedy was conscious to minimize any permanent neurological effects, was deemed successful in its goals. Kennedy left the hospital a week later to begin a course of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Opinions varied regarding Kennedy's prognosis: the surgery typically only extended survival time by a matter of months, but sometimes people lived for years.|$|E
5|$|Male tigers are {{generally}} more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of other females. Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression. Several such incidents have been observed in which the subordinate tiger yielded defeat by rolling onto its back and showing its belly in a submissive posture. Once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, {{as long as they}} do not live in too close quarters. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>aggressive</b> disputes tend to occur between two males when a female is in oestrus, and may rarely result in the death of one of the males.|$|E

5|$|The {{leaders of}} these {{so-called}} Lords Ordainers were Robert Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, {{on the side}} of the clergy, and Warwick, Lincoln and Lancaster among the earls.

Thomas of Lancaster, who was Lincoln's son-in-law and heir, was the king's cousin and the wealthiest nobleman in the realm, but at this point he took a less active part in the reform movement. Warwick is described by some sources as the leader of the Ordainers; he was certainly <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>aggressive.</b> The set of Ordinances they drafted put heavy restrictions on the king's financial freedom, and his right to appoint his own ministers.

25|$|The {{most common}} cell type {{exhibited}} by {{renal cell carcinoma}} is the clear cell, which is named by the dissolving of the cells' high lipid content in the cytoplasm.
