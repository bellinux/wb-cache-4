5|$|Occupational {{autonomy}} is a {{key factor}} in regards to class positions. Professionals and managers who are exclusively labeled as middle class and often as upper middle class, conceptualize, create and consult in their jobs.

On more than one occasion, male guardsmen would {{make the point that}} the USCG had struggled along without women for over 150 years. Attitudes toward them ranged from enthusiasm and amusement to open hostility. But not all the objections were personal or petty. Many of the men simply failed to see the need for women in the service, while others felt it was an unnecessary expense. However, if the women were equal to the job the men were willing to give them their due. Many men, regulars and reservists, supported them, taught them the ropes, and gave them encouragement.|$|E

25|$|Autonomy {{is often}} seen {{as one of the}} {{greatest}} measurements of a person's class status. Even though some working class employees might also enjoy largely self-directed work, large degrees of autonomy in <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>place,</b> as well as influence over the organizational process, which are commonly the results of obtained expertise, these can still be seen as hallmarks of upper-middle-class or professional-middle-class professions.|$|E

25|$|A {{belief of}} counter-{{transhumanism}} is that transhumanism can cause unfair human enhancement {{in many areas}} of life, but specifically on the social plane.

25|$|These {{professionals}} typically conceptualize, create, consult, and supervise. As a result, {{upper middle}} class employees enjoy great autonomy in <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>place</b> and are more satisfied with their careers than non-professional middle class individuals. In terms of financial wealth income, the professional middle class fits in the top third, but seldom reach the top 5% of American society.

25|$|Women and {{children}} experiencing domestic violence undergo occupational apartheid; they are typically {{denied access to}} desired occupations. Abusive partners may limit occupations and create an occupationally void environment which reinforces feelings of low self-worth and poor self-efficacy in ability to satisfactorily perform everyday tasks. In addition, work is impacted by functional losses, ability to maintain necessary employment skills, and ability to function within <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>place.</b> Oftentimes the victims are very isolated from other relationships as well such as having few to no friends, this is another method of control for the abuser.|$|E

According to the Department of Labor, {{there have been a}} rise in increasing amount of hours in <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>place</b> by employed women, an increase in extended work weeks (>40 hours) by men, and a considerable increase in combined working hours among working couples, particularly couples with young children.|$|E

25|$|Rebellion and {{rejection}} are also expressed themes in this story. Bartleby refuses {{to conform to}} the normal ways of the people around him and instead, simply just doesn't complete his tasks requested by his boss. He does not make any request for changes in the workplace, but just continues to be passive to the work happening around him. Just as public rejects changes from a normal routine, this rebellious style by Bartleby causes his co-workers to reject him as he is not behaving the same as the rest of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>place</b> environment. The narrator tries multiple tactics to get Bartleby {{to conform to the}} standards of the workplace, and ultimately realizes that Bartleby's mental state is not that of normal society. Although the narrator sees Bartleby as a harmless person, the narrator refuses to engage in the same peculiar rhythm that Bartleby is stuck in.|$|E
25|$|Coping {{occurs in}} {{response}} to psychological stress—usually triggered by changes—in an effort to maintain mental health and emotional well-being. Life stressors are often described as negative events (loss of a job). However, positive changes in life (a new job) can also constitute life stressors, thus requiring the use of coping skills to adapt. Coping strategies are the behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that you use {{to adjust to the}} changes that occur in your life. The use of coping skills will help a person better themselves in <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>place</b> and perform {{to the best of their}} ability to achieve success. There are many ways to cope and adapt to changes. Some ways include: sharing emotions with peers, having a healthy social life outside of work, being humorous, and adjusting expectations of self and work. These coping skills will help turn negative emotion to positive and allow for more focus on the public in contrast to oneself.|$|E
25|$|After {{the return}} of democracy, {{the change in the}} status of women was dramatic. One {{significant}} indicator was the changing place of women in the work force. In the traditional Spanish world, women rarely entered the job market. By the late 1970s, however, 22 percent of the country's adult women, still somewhat fewer than in Italy and in Ireland, had entered the work force. By 1984 this figure had increased to 33 percent, a level not significantly different from Italy or the Netherlands. Women still made up less than one-third of the total labor force, however, and in some important sectors, such as banking, the figure was closer to one-tenth. A 1977 opinion poll revealed that when asked whether a woman's place was in the home only 22 percent of young people in Spain agreed, compared with 26 percent in Britain, 30 percent in Italy, and 37 percent in France. The principal barrier to women in <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>place,</b> however, was not public opinion, but rather such factors as a high unemployment rate and a lack of part-time jobs. In education, women were rapidly achieving parity with men, at least statistically. In 1983, approximately 46 percent of Spain's university enrollment was female, the thirty-first highest percentage in the world, and comparable to most other European countries.|$|E

500|$|The WAVES enjoyed many {{successes in}} <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>place,</b> {{but they also}} {{suffered}} from intolerance. Some of the problems sprang from contradictory attitudes of men who supervised women.

The mission of the WAVES was to replace men in shore stations for sea duty. Still, certain men were hostile to WAVES because being replaced meant sea duty.
