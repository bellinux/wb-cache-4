It is {{revealed}} that the reactor is under attack by the original AVALANCHE group, who are the cause of Shinra's attack upon the town. Unaware of their involvement, Barret uses their ideals to form his own branch of the group.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} the Autumns dry dock, Carter is {{critically}} wounded. He rams his ship into a Covenant mobile assault platform, allowing Six and Emile to safely reach the shipyard. Emile uses a mass driver emplacement to defend the Autumn while Six fights through Covenant ground forces to get Cortana to the Autumns captain, Jacob Keyes. When Emile is slain by Elites, Six remains behind to control the gun, ensuring the Autumns escape. The Autumn flees from Reach and discovers a Halo ringworld, leading directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> Halo: Combat Evolved.|$|E

5|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain {{forms the}} final {{part of an}} {{unofficial}} trilogy with Moonlight Syndrome, a spin-off of the Twilight Syndrome series Suda's final work for Human Entertainment, and The Silver Case. According to Suda, while they use the same setting and have some recurring characters, there is otherwise no connection. Despite acting as a sequel to The Silver Case, and featuring a version of that game's protagonist Sumio Kodai, the story was almost completely unrelated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> The Silver Case. This approach {{was inspired by the}} Star System utilized by manga artist Osamu Tezuka. The opening scene, where Mondo drives his car towards the island, was put into the game to both introduce Mondo's character to newcomers, and to throw players of The Silver Case off guard and confirm Mondo's two different identities in the two games. It also helped establish the setting and get the player used to Mondo's point of view. His portable computer Catherine, stored in a suitcase, was a reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> The Silver Case due to earlier events being concentrated within it. Despite this, its silver color was coincidental rather than a deliberate reference to the previous game's title.|$|E

30|$|Models for {{survival}} analysis typically consider that every {{subject in the}} population under study is susceptible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> interest and will eventually experience such event if follow-up is sufficiently long. However, there are situations when a fraction of individuals are not expected <b>to</b> experience <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> interest, that is, those individuals are cured or not susceptible. Cure rate models {{for survival}} data {{have been used to}} model time-to-event data for various types of cancers, including breast cancer, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, leukemia, prostate cancer and melanoma. These models have become very popular due to significant progress in treatment therapies leading to enhanced cure rates.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this presentation, {{we review}} an {{alternative}} technique called splitting, which accelerates {{the rate of}} occurrence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rare <b>events</b> <b>of</b> interest. Here, we do not change the probability laws driving the model. Instead, we use a selection mechanism <b>to</b> favour <b>the</b> trajectories deemed likely to lead <b>to</b> those rare <b>events.</b> <b>The</b> main idea is <b>to</b> decompose <b>the</b> paths <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rare <b>events</b> <b>of</b> interest into shorter subpaths whose probability is not so small, encourage the realizations that take these subpaths (leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> interest) by giving {{them a chance to}} reproduce (a bit like in selective evolution), and discourage the realizations that go in the wrong direction by killing them with some positive probability...|$|R

5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in Europe on August 16, 2012 and in North America the following day. The Expendables 2 grossed over $310million worldwide, with its greatest success outside North America. Critics generally considered the film an improvement over its predecessor (citing an increased use of humor and action scenes), but its plot and dialogue received negative reviews. A tie-in downloadable video game was released on July 31, 2012 as a prequel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> the film. A sequel, The Expendables 3, was released on August 15, 2014.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is set in}} 2097, {{according}} to the introductory sequence. This sequence also provides {{the history of the}} game’s setting: in 2057, the depletion of Earth’s resources coincided with widening space exploration. After a catastrophic war over ever-declining resources, ending 10 years prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> G-Police, Earth’s governments were stripped of military power. As a result, powerful corporations had exerted control over Earth and the burgeoning space colonies. The Government Police (G-Police) was formed by Earth’s remaining coalition government to maintain order in these colonies.|$|E

5|$|Trevor {{appears as}} a main {{character}} in Grand Theft Auto Online, the online multiplayer mode of Grand Theft Auto V. He provides missions to the player character once they reach Rank 13; after the player steals Trevor's rolling meth lab, Trevor demands that they are to complete jobs for him to settle the issue. The jobs that Trevor demands generally consist of stealing drugs from rival groups, specifically the Lost Motorcycle Club, while killing the dealers.

5|$|Troilus' {{death was}} also {{described}} in the Cypria, one of {{the parts of the}} Epic Cycle that is no longer extant. The poem covered the events preceding the Trojan War and {{the first part of the}} war itself up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> the Iliad. Although the Cypria does not survive, most of an ancient summary of the contents, thought to be by Eutychius Proclus, remains. Fragment 1 mentions that Achilles killed Troilus, but provides no more detail. However, Sommerstein takes the verb used to describe the killing (phoneuei) as meaning that Achilles murders Troilus.|$|E
5|$|While writing The Last of Us, Druckmann had {{a general}} {{idea of the}} events that would shape Ellie's identity; when conceiving the story {{direction}} for Left Behind, he found that these events were suitable. Druckmann felt that omitting the nature of the argument between Ellie and Riley, which took place prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> the game, allowed players to draw their own conclusions. The team found various sections of the game interesting, such as the references to Facebook and Halloween, as the characters are unaware of their meaning.|$|E

Following this, cortisol levels decline throughout the day with lowest levels during the ﬁrst half of the night.

40|$|In {{modelling}} lifetime data, standard parametric theory {{assumes that}} all observations will eventually experience <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> interest {{if they are}} monitored {{for a very long}} period.

A mixture cured fraction model with covariates is modified to incorporate random clustering effect <b>to</b> characterize <b>the</b> switch mechanism. Simulation studies and telecommunications data show that cured fraction models with random clustering effect perform better than their parametric counterpart in terms of predictive ability...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} witnesses, {{including}} Hannah Cox, testified <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> {{the evening of}} 26 May and of the following morning. The first witnesses to attract significant cross-examination by William Reader, Thornton's barrister, were the two factory workers, William Lavell and Joseph Bird, who had matched Thornton's shoes to the footprints in the harrowed field. Under cross-examination, both admitted that it had rained heavily between the time the footprints were made and the time they attempted to match the prints. Constable Dales told the jury that Thornton admitted having sex with Ashford before he was searched: that is, before his bloodstained clothing came to light. Mr Freer, a Birmingham surgeon who conducted the post-mortem, testified as to its results, and stated that except for the vaginal lacerations, {{there were no signs}} of violence on Ashford's person, and that those cuts could have been caused by consensual sexual relations. Freer's testimony concluded the prosecution case, and as the defendant declined to exercise his right to himself make a statement to the court, the defence began calling witnesses.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of all these processes, large numbers of memorials, more than for any other conflict, were built across the world during the inter-war period. It is {{estimated}} that France built around 176,000 war memorials, including around 36,000 in the local communes. Most of the local commune memorials were built by 1922, but those in the towns and cities typically required more protracted negotiations, and their construction stretched into the 1930s. The 1920s were particularly busy for construction of memorials in Britain, although the trend tailed off in 1930s, with the last inter-war memorial unveiled at the town of Mumbles in 1939. The commissioning of Australian war memorials similarly reduced after the mid-1920s. Over 3,500 Romanian memorials were erected. Many German memorials were built during the 1930s. Russia was unusual in building very few war memorials <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> World War I, mainly as {{a result of}} the devastation of the Civil War and the political views of the subsequent Bolshevik government.|$|E
5|$|As the day wore on, {{conditions}} {{appeared more}} and more favorable for thunderstorms, and {{more and more}} similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> March 20. Weather radar images showed a severe squall line had formed to the west, and weather stations to the west reported cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms. In an afternoon meeting, under some pressure from their commanding officer, base meteorologists composed and issued the first official tornado forecast. Although they were aware of the small chance of success, they felt they had no choice, since the conditions were so similar to March 20. Equipment which could be was moved to bomb-proof shelters, and base personnel were moved to safer areas.|$|E
