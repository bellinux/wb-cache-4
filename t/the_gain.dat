Virginia Tech punter Jimmy Kibble kicked the ball back to Nebraska, which returned it to its 15-yard line, and the Nebraska offense returned to the field.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation {{may cause}} either <b>the</b> <b>gain</b> {{of a new}} feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is {{bacterial}} adaptation to antibiotic selection, with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance by both modifying {{the target of the}} drug, or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell. Other striking examples are the bacteria Escherichia coli evolving the ability to use citric acid as a nutrient in a long-term laboratory experiment, Flavobacterium evolving a novel enzyme that allows these bacteria to grow on the by-products of nylon manufacturing, and the soil bacterium Sphingobium evolving an entirely new metabolic pathway that degrades the synthetic pesticide pentachlorophenol. An interesting but still controversial idea is that some adaptations might increase the ability of organisms to generate genetic diversity and adapt by natural selection (increasing organisms' evolvability).|$|E

It discusses various aspects of Yoga, ranging from recommending that healthy food should be eaten in temperate quantities, in small portions, several times a day, to recommending that Yoga should not be performed when one is not feeling well or is very hungry.

5|$|Following the Tech kickoff, Miami began a {{drive at}} its 20-yard line and went three and out. Following the Hurricanes' punt, Tech's offense began work at its 22-yard line. Despite having {{a chance to}} take the lead with a {{successful}} drive, the Hokies also went three and out, punting back to Miami and allowing the Hurricanes to begin a possession at their 33-yard line. This possession was more successful than Miami's first of the second half. Kelly ran for four yards, then completed a six-yard pass for a first down. Tech committed a 15-yard grabbing-the-facemask penalty, and Kelly completed a 15-yard pass that pushed the Miami offense to the Tech 22-yard line. Young picked up 12 yards and a first down with a rush to the left, but Kelly was sacked for a loss of 13 yards, negating <b>the</b> <b>gain.</b> Unable to gain another first down or a touchdown, Miami was forced to settle for a field goal attempt.

The next week, Maryland secured bowl eligibility by winning its regular season finale against NC State. Scott returned the opening kickoff 36yards and recorded 89yards on eight carries to lead the team in rushing. In the 2007 Emerald Bowl against Oregon State, Scott had one carry for no gain and returned two kickoffs for 36yards. Scott finished the season as the team's all-purpose yardage leader with 84.2yards per game and kick return leader with 566yards, which set a school record for a freshman. Rivals.com named him a freshman All-ACC all-purpose player.|$|E
40|$|Secular {{gains in}} IQ test scores have been {{reported}} for many Western countries. This is the first study of secular IQ gains in South Korea, using various datasets. The first question is what {{the size of the}} Flynn effect in South Korea is. <b>The</b> <b>gains</b> per decade are 7. 7 points for persons born between 1970 and 1990.

Following the catch, North Carolina had a first down at the Virginia Tech 16-yard line. Linton left the field limping slightly, and backup running Mike Geter replaced him, then ran for four yards up the middle. Geter was stopped for no gain on the next play, and a third down pass by Keldorf fell incomplete. North Carolina kicker Josh McGee entered the game to attempt a 29-yard field goal, which was good. With 9:15 remaining in the quarter, North Carolina took a 30 lead.|$|E

The Progressive Conservatives took 112 seats to the Liberals' 105: a plurality, but not a majority.

Due to dreadful management of the Canadian forces by Turner and Brigadier-General Huntly Ketchen, German soldiers overran the crater, causing 1,400 Canadian casualties and retaking the land around the crater, negating the gains made at heavy cost just a few days before. Sir Herbert Plumer, the commander of British 2nd Army who had overall responsibility for the front, demanded Ketchen's immediate dismissal and when Turner claimed that if Ketchen was dismissed he would resign, Alderson sought his dismissal as well. Both officers were supporters of Sam Hughes, who made it clear in no uncertain terms to Commander in Chief Sir Douglas Haig that if Turner went then Haig could no longer rely on Canadian support.|$|E
