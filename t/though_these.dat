5|$|Local legends {{associate}} it with Arthurian England and Camelot, <b>though</b> <b>these</b> {{may be due to}} {{confusion with}} the better-known Cadbury Castle, near South Cadbury some 50miles to the south.|$|E
5|$|Lyotropic mesophases are {{analyzed}} {{in a similar}} fashion, <b>though</b> <b>these</b> experiments are somewhat more complex, as the concentration of mesogen is a key factor. These experiments are run at various concentrations of mesogen in order to analyze that impact.|$|E
5|$|A more {{indirect}} {{effect would be}} that the contracted s and p1/2 orbitals shield (take on themselves) the charge of the nucleus more effectively, leaving even less for the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move on larger orbitals. Dubnium is greatly affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons are more difficult to extract from an atom than the 6d electrons, <b>though</b> <b>these</b> energy levels remain close to each other.|$|E

Species of Velociraptor have also been reported from the slightly younger Barun Goyot Formation of Mongolia, <b>though</b> <b>these</b> are indeterminate and may belong to a related genus instead. These geologic formations are estimated to {{date back to the}} Campanian stage (between 83 and 70million years ago) of the Late Cretaceous Epoch.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the longer}} shadow the array casts when tilted at a steeper angle, {{this area is}} {{typically}} about 10% higher for an adjustable tilt array or a single axis tracker, and 20% higher for a 2-axis tracker, <b>though</b> <b>these</b> figures will {{vary depending on the}} latitude and topography.|$|E

5|$|Cabral was not {{the first}} European to stumble upon areas of present-day Brazil, not to mention other parts of South America. Roman coins have been found in today's Venezuela, {{northwest}} of Brazil, presumably from ships that were carried away by storm in ancient times. Norsemen reached North America and even established settlements, <b>though</b> <b>these</b> ended in failure sometime {{before the end of the}} 15th century. Christopher Columbus, on his third voyage to the New World in 1498, traveled along part of what would later become Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|Criteria for the {{selection}} of national parks include natural beauty, unique geological features, unusual ecosystems, and recreational opportunities (<b>though</b> <b>these</b> criteria are not always considered together). National Monuments, on the other hand, are frequently chosen for their historical or archaeological significance. Fourteen national parks are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS), while twenty one are designated UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BR).|$|E
5|$|During {{the ensuing}} years, Parliament adopted several more minor reforms. Acts of Parliament passed in 1835 and 1836 {{increased}} the number of polling places in each constituency, and reduced polling to a single day. Parliament also passed several laws aimed at combatting corruption, including the Corrupt Practices Act 1854, <b>though</b> <b>these</b> measures proved largely ineffectual. Neither party strove for further major reform; leading statesmen on both sides regarded the Reform Act as a final settlement.|$|E

While it appears as <b>though</b> <b>these</b> treatments are effective in the breeding season immediately following injection, the lasting effects are debated. Because it is costly and difficult to treat animals repeatedly, this method, despite being ideal, is not widely implemented.|$|E
5|$|France closely {{followed}} the election, deporting a Peace Corps teacher. The UDSG {{disappeared from the}} political scene, and M'ba's opposition was composed of parties that lacked national focus and maintained only regional or pro-democracy platforms. Nevertheless, the opposition garnered 46% of the vote and 16 of 47 seats in the assembly, while the BDG received 54% of the vote and 31 seats. The opposition disputed this, and held strikes across the country, <b>though</b> <b>these</b> {{did not have a}} sizable impact on business.|$|E
5|$|In the Decembers of 1916 and 1917, German overtures to the British for truces were {{recorded}} without any success.

5|$|Instead, {{the state}} {{collects}} revenue from property taxes (<b>though</b> <b>these</b> are {{collected at the}} county, city, and school district level; Texas has a state constitutional prohibition against a state property tax) and sales taxes. The state sales tax rate is 6.25 percent, but local taxing jurisdictions (cities, counties, special purpose districts, and transit authorities) may also impose sales and use tax up to 2 percent for a total maximum combined rate of 8.25 percent.|$|E
5|$|July 2 - Hurricane Arthur passed {{just off}} the coast of Eastern Florida. Its outer rainbands caused strong {{straight}} line winds from thunderstorms, peaking at 83mph, <b>though</b> <b>these</b> winds only caused $23,000 (2015 USD). About 2 inches of rain fell in the state as well. Strong rip currents and waves caused about a dozen swimmers to be rescued at Daytona Beach. Damage totaled to no more than $25,800 (2017 USD).|$|E
5|$|Napoleon withdrew {{back into}} France, his army reduced to 70,000 soldiers, and little cavalry; he faced {{more than three}} times as many Allied troops.

Napoleon won a series of victories in the Six Days' Campaign, <b>though</b> <b>these</b> were not significant enough to turn the tide. The leaders of Paris surrendered to the Coalition in March 1814.|$|E
