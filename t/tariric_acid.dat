In the nearly two centuries that have followed, {{well over a}} thousand naturally occurring acetylenes have been discovered and reported. Polyynes, a subset of this class of natural products, have been isolated {{from a wide variety}} of plant species, cultures of higher fungi, bacteria, marine sponges, and corals. Some acids like <b>tariric</b> <b>acid</b> contains an alkyne group. Diynes and triynes, species with the linkage RC≡C–C≡CR′ and RC≡C–C≡C–C≡CR′ respectively, occur in certain plants (Ichthyothere, Chrysanthemum, Cicuta, Oenanthe and other members of the Asteraceae and Apiaceae families). Some examples are cicutoxin, oenanthotoxin, falcarinol and carotatoxin. These compounds are highly bioactive, e.g. as nematocides. 1-Phenylhepta-1,3,5-triyne is illustrative of a naturally occurring triyne.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tariric</b> <b>acid</b> is biosynthesised from petroselinic acid; both {{fatty acids}} {{have been found}} {{together}} in Picramnia and Alvaradoa species. The occurrence of <b>tariric</b> <b>acid</b> as the major fatty acid is typical for the Picramniaceae.|$|E

50|$|The root also {{contains}} the fatty acids <b>tariric</b> <b>acid</b> and 10Z,14E,16E-octadeca-10,14,16-triene-12-ynoic acid.|$|E

5000|$|Léon-Albert Arnaud (1853-1915) was {{the first}} {{scientist}} to describe the chemical make-up of <b>tariric</b> <b>acid,</b> an extraction from the glucoside of the [...] "tariri plant" [...] found in Guatemala.|$|E
50|$|In {{chemical}} analysis, <b>tariric</b> <b>acid</b> can {{be separated}} from other fatty acids by gas chromatography of methyl esters; additionally, a separation of unsaturated fatty acids is possible by argentation thin-layer chromatography.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tariric</b> <b>acid</b> {{has been}} found in several oils and fats of plant origin. It was first {{isolated}} in 1892 from the seed oil of a species of Picramnia. It appears in Picramnia camboita from Brazil, Picramnia carpinterae from Guatemala, and Picramnia lindeniana from Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|Arnaud was {{the first}} {{scientist}} to describe the chemical make-up of <b>tariric</b> <b>acid,</b> an extraction from the glucoside of the [...] "tariri plant" [...] found in Guatemala. He is also credited with isolating tanghinine, taken from Tanghinia venenifera; (family Apocynaceae), and in 1883 discovered a new alkaloid called cinchonamine.|$|E
5000|$|Petroselinic {{was first}} {{isolated}} from parsley seed oil in 1909. Petroselinic acid occurs in high amounts in plants in Apiaceae, Araliaceae, Griselinia (Griseliniaceae) and in Garryaceae. [...] In Picramniaceae, petroselinic acid {{is accompanied by}} <b>tariric</b> <b>acid.</b> In addition, petroselinic acid {{has been found in}} minor amounts in several fats of plant and animal origin, including in human sources.|$|E
