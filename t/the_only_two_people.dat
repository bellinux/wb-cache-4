5|$|Andrew Dudley was one {{of three}} sons of Edmund Dudley, a {{councillor}} of King Henry VII, and his second wife Elizabeth Grey, daughter of Edward Grey, 4th Viscount Lisle. When he was a toddler, his father was executed by the young Henry VIII as a scapegoat for the former king's financial policies. His eldest brother was John Dudley, later Duke of Northumberland, who sought to advance him in the king's service. Andrew Dudley served in the household of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and as an officer of the exchequer in the 1540s. Answering a complaint against exchequer activities in October 1540, Norfolk told the Privy Council that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> he had ever found jobs for were Andrew Dudley and Edward Belingeham.|$|E
5|$|Prism {{made its}} {{official}} debut in Ireland, where it charted atop the charts. In the United States, the album {{opened at the}} top spot on the US Billboard 200, becoming her second consecutive number one album in the country. The album sold 286,000 copies in its first week. Prism acquired the largest first week sum by a female artist for 2013, surpassing Miley Cyrus' Bangerz (270,000 copies). However, this feat was surpassed by Beyoncé's self-titled fifth album, Beyoncé (617,213 digital copies), released in December 2013. At {{the time of its}} release Prism had the fourth highest first week sales of the year for a pop record, trailing behind Daft Punk's May 2013 album Random Access Memories, which sold 339,000 copies and Justin Timberlake's The 20/20 Experience which debuted to 968,000 copies and its follow-up The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2 which debuted to just 350,000 copies. The first week sales also marks Perry's highest weekly sales, with her previous album Teenage Dream selling 192,000 copies in its first week in August 2010. Prism has the highest first week sales for a female pop artist since Madonna's twelfth studio album, MDNA. Prism sold 92,000 copies during its second week of availability, falling to number two on the Billboard 200. This represented the smallest sales dip for a number one album in the United States since the August 2013 release of The Civil Wars. Prism has spent 17 weeks so far in the top-ten on the chart. The album has been certified double Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold 1.7 million copies in the United States as of February 2017. In June 2014, Billboard announced its Mid Year Top 20 Best-selling albums with Prism coming in at number 9 with sales of 453,000 in 2014 alone. Pharrell Williams and Perry were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> in to have an album and a single in the Mid Year Top 10 charts. In February 2015, following Perry's performance at the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show, sales for the album increased by 85% and the album rebounded back into the Top 50.|$|E

While he was secure financially, Brown's frustration grew with each passing year. [...] "It was terrible", he later recalled. [...] "I had everything a man could want: leisure, enough money, a wonderful family. Yet with all that, I was eating my heart out." [...] Because Brown was still receiving his annual salary and liked to golf, it was said that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> who made more money playing golf were Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus.|$|E

2500|$|Less dramatically, {{there were}} {{suggestions}} that Eden’s touchiness and over-sensitivity to criticism, characteristics frequently remarked upon by colleagues, were exacerbated by Lady Avon (described by historian Barry Turner, without explanation, as [...] "equally touchy"). One of Eden's private secretaries claimed that [...] "she {{had a habit}} of stirring up Anthony when he didn't need it". However, Eden's biographer D. R. Thorpe concluded that such imputations arose from a misreading of the Edens' relationship, noting also that, during Suez, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> in whom Eden could confide without inhibition were his wife and the Queen. Indeed, as historian Ben Pimlott put it, [...] "if Lady Eden came to believe that the Suez Canal flowed through her drawing room, the Queen must have felt pretty damp as well" [...] David Dutton, another (not notably sympathetic) biographer of Eden, noted that [...] "some observers believed that Clarissa was excessively protective and tended to exacerbate Eden's natural volatility" [...] but also remarked on her devoted companionship and that [...] "during the dark days of the Suez Crisis, [...] was at his side, supportive throughout".|$|E

2500|$|Cunningham {{became a}} short-list {{candidate}} for the cabinet of Governor Ed Rendell. Initial discussions centered around the secretary position for the Department of Community and Economic Development. In December 2002, Cunningham cut short his trip to a National League of Cities conference in Salt Lake City to fly to Philadelphia and discuss the post with Rendell. Cunningham and Rendell had previously met through the Pennsylvania League of Cities and Municipalities, {{near the end of}} Rendell's tenure as mayor of Philadelphia, and they had been friends since. Rendell said economic development of the state's urban core was one of the top issues of his administration, and that he had [...] "tremendous respect" [...] for Cunningham and his accomplishments in Bethlehem. Likewise, Cunningham said he had modeled his administration's economic development plan for Bethlehem in part after the prototype Rendell used as mayor of Philadelphia. In January 2003, it was announced Rendell had tapped Cunningham for a secretary position, but with the Department of General Services, not the Department of Community and Economic Development. Although Cunningham was a candidate for both posts, Rendell said his track record of success in Bethlehem despite the loss of Bethlehem Steel would serve him well in maintaining the state's costs. Rendell also said Cunningham would be in the forefront of an effort to contain spending in the state government, which was facing a $2 billion budget deficit. Rendell said of Cunningham: [...] "You might be looking at <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> in Pennsylvania who know how to cut costs." ...|$|E
