50|$|Deleuze’s {{cinematic}} taxonomy {{emerges from}} the philosophy of Henri Bergson in Matter and Memory (1896).

Deleuze sees a correspondence between Bergson’s tripartite formulation and the cinematic medium. There are thus three types of cinematic movement-images: perception images (<b>that</b> <b>focus</b> on what is seen), affection images (<b>that</b> <b>focus</b> on expressions of feeling) and action images (<b>that</b> <b>focus</b> on the duration of action). These three images are associated, respectively, with long shots, close-ups and medium shots.|$|R
