5|$|Chaytor's Anzac Mounted Division {{moved off}} across the {{maritime}} plain towards the coast soon after daylight on 9 November, having watered their horses the previous evening. The advance was led by two brigades—on the left the 1st Light Horse Brigade and on the right the 2nd Light Horse Brigade rode in line, each {{responsible for their own}} front and outer flanks; <b>the</b> <b>attached</b> 7th Mounted Brigade formed a reserve.|$|E
5|$|Belgian plans did {{not call}} for the {{garrison}} of the fort and <b>the</b> <b>attached</b> defending forces to fight a sustained battle against an attacking force; {{it was assumed that}} sufficient warning of an attack would be given so that the detachment on {{the eastern side of the}} canal could be withdrawn, the bridges destroyed and the garrison ready to fight a delaying action. The defending force would then retire to the main defensive positions along the River Dyle, where they would link up with other Allied forces.|$|E

50|$|Key {{components}} of a cargo hook include the load beam, the keeper, and <b>the</b> <b>attach</b> point. <b>The</b> load beam is the solid piece of metal {{at the bottom of}} a cargo hook that supports the load. Usually it has a curved, narrow end which is used to load a ring, rope, or net onto the hook. The keeper is the locking, spring-operated mechanism that keeps the load from sliding off the load beam during transport. <b>The</b> <b>attach</b> point <b>attaches</b> <b>the</b> hook to the belly of the helicopter, swing system, or longline.|$|R
5|$|Central to Gray's was {{the system}} shared across the Inns of Court of {{progress}} towards {{a call to}} the Bar, which lasted approximately 12 to 14 years. A student would first study at either Oxford or Cambridge University, or at one of the Inns of Chancery, which were dedicated legal training institutions. If he studied at Oxford or Cambridge he would spend three years working towards a degree, and be admitted to one of the Inns of Court after graduation. If he studied at one of the Inns of Chancery he would do so for one year before seeking admission to the Inn of Court to which his Inn of Chancery was tied—in the case of Gray's Inn, <b>the</b> <b>attached</b> Inns of Chancery were Staple Inn and Barnard's Inn.|$|E
5|$|Model's {{main attack}} was {{delivered}} by XLVII Panzer Corps, supported by 45 Tigers of <b>the</b> <b>attached</b> 505th Heavy Tank Battalion. Covering their left flank was XLI Panzer Corps, with an attached regiment of 83 Ferdinand tank destroyers. On the right flank, XLVI Panzer Corps consisted {{at this time}} of four infantry divisions with just 9 tanks and 31 assault guns. To the left of XLI Panzer Corps was XXIII Army Corps, which consisted of the reinforced 78th Assault Infantry Division and two regular infantry divisions. While the corps contained no tanks, it did have 62 assault guns. Opposing the 9th Army was the Central Front, deployed in three heavily fortified defensive belts.|$|E
5|$|Monthly average temperatures, {{rainfall}} and snowfall for four communities {{are shown in}} <b>the</b> <b>attached</b> graphs. St. John's represents the east coast, Gander {{the interior of the}} island, Corner Brook the west coast of the island and Wabush the interior of Labrador. The detailed information and information for 73 communities in the province is available from a government website. The data used in making the graphs is the average taken over thirty years. Error bars on the temperature graph indicate the range of daytime highs and night time lows. Snowfall is the total amount which fell during the month, not the amount accumulated on the ground. This distinction is particularly important for St. John's where a heavy snowfall can be followed by rain so that no snow remains on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse {{transcriptase}} liberates the single-stranded (+)RNA genome from <b>the</b> <b>attached</b> viral proteins and copies {{it into a}} complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule. The process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that creates a sense DNA from the antisense cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase.|$|E

Some weeks pass, and Joe the Mexican woos Suzy. He has no success, and his attempts irritate Doc. The next day, Doc himself approaches the pipe with flowers in hand ("How Long?"), still uncertain as to why he is seeking a girl like Suzy. Suzy lets him in the boiler, which she has fitted up in a homelike manner. She is doing well at the burger joint, but is grateful to Fauna for giving her confidence. She is confident enough, indeed, to reject Doc, who is unhappy, but philosophical ("The Next Time It Happens").|$|E

To the Main Stand's right, in the corner above the end of the enclosure and next to the Kenilworth Stand, is the David Preece Stand, a family area which seats 711 spectators. The David Preece Stand acquired its present name in 2008, a year after the former player's death.|$|E
5|$|The article {{explains}} {{the sequence of}} events of this August 4 New York City demonstration flight of 1895. When the reporter was all positioned and ready in the sky-cycle he gave word to the ground crew {{to let go of the}} ropes that held the hydrogen balloon back and it immediately lifted the sky-cycle into the air. The airship drifted up slowly at first, going towards the factory roof peaks. The driver-reporter immediately dropped one of the sandbag weights and the sky-cycle airship rose up sharply, avoiding the building roofs. When the airship was about a thousand feet high <b>the</b> <b>attached</b> balloon propeller revolved and the sky-cycle airship flew over the East River.

5|$|These ulcers occur {{periodically}} {{and heal}} completely between attacks.

Most appear on the non-keratinizing epithelial surfaces in the mouth (i.e. anywhere except <b>the</b> <b>attached</b> gingiva, the hard palate and the dorsum of the tongue), although the more severe forms, which are less common, may also involve keratinizing epithelial surfaces. Symptoms range from a minor nuisance to interfering with eating and drinking. The severe forms may be debilitating, even causing weight loss due to malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|Within a year, Laurel Grove failed. Fred was inexperienced {{and made}} poor bargains with local merchants. Before the war, {{plantations}} {{had been largely}} self-sufficient, but Fred paid high prices for goods shipped in from Savannah and Charleston.

5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Tripoli in January 1943, the {{remaining}} Axis forces retreated to prepared defences in Southern Tunisia, {{in front of the}} Mareth Line built by France before the war. Here in March, Horrocks carried out one of his most successful actions. His corps, composed of the 1stArmoured Division, a Free French brigade and <b>the</b> <b>attached</b> New Zealand Corps (which included the 2nd New Zealand Division and the British 8th Armoured Brigade), was ordered to attack as part of Operation Supercharge after XXXCorps failed to breach the line. He carried out a flanking manoeuvre through a pass judged by the Germans to be impenetrable, rendering the Mareth position untenable and forcing the Axis into another retreat. Three Italian divisions were destroyed, and the German 15th and 21stPanzer Divisions and the 164thDivision were heavily depleted. Horrocks was then transferred to the First Army to take over IXCorps after its previous commander, Lieutenant-General John Crocker, was wounded in a training accident. He led this corps in the final Allied offensive in Tunisia during April and May 1943, capturing Tunis and accepting the surrender of the remnants of Rommel's Army Group Africa. He was mentioned in despatches on 24 June, and for his service in Tunisia, was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 5 August. He was also given the rank of temporary lieutenant-general and war substantive major-general.|$|E
