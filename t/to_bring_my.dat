What should I do now, with no lifebelt and no shoes and no cap? ...|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the things}} being {{discussed}} at the meetings was the pressing issue of recruitment. A West Point graduate, Ulysses was {{the only man in}} town with professional military training, and was elected to preside over the meeting. When Ulysses was given command of the 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, a regiment composed of unruly volunteers, Jesse expressed disappointment in a letter to him, feeling that Ulysses' talent and efforts would have been better used commanding regular army troops. In a reply letter to his father Ulysses attempted to abate Jesse's criticism maintaining, [...] "You ask if I should not like to go in the regular army. I should not. I want <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>my</b> children (recruits) up to useful employment, and in the army the chance is poor", stressing the point that he was more concerned about the war than he was a career.|$|E
2500|$|After Elijah's {{confrontation}} with Ahab, God {{tells him to}} flee out of Israel, to a hiding place by the brook Chorath, east of the Jordan, where he will be fed by ravens. When the brook dries up, God sends him to a widow living {{in the town of}} Zarephath in Phoenicia. When Elijah finds her and asks to be fed, she says that she does not have sufficient food to keep her and her own son alive. Elijah tells her that God will not allow her supply of flour or oil to run out, saying, “Do not be afraid ... For thus says the Lord the God of Israel: The jar of meal will not be emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the Lord sends rain on the earth.” She feeds him the last of their food, and Elijah's promise miraculously comes true. God gave her [...] "manna" [...] from heaven even while he was withholding food from his unfaithful people in the promised land. Some time later the widow's son dies and the widow cries, [...] "You have come to me <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>my</b> sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!" [...] Elijah prays that God might restore her son so that the trustworthiness of God's word might be demonstrated. 1 Kings 17:22 relates how God [...] "listened to the voice of Elijah; the life of the child came into him again, and he revived." [...] This is the first instance of raising the dead recorded in Scripture. This non-Israelite widow was granted the life of her son, the only hope for a widow in ancient society. The widow cried, [...] "...the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth." [...] She made a confession that the Israelites had failed to make.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] said Miss Sally, {{as quietly}} {{as if he had}} {{expected}} the notice all along. [...] "Any objections <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>my</b> wife down <b>to</b> the ranch?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I've {{never in}} my life seen {{anything}} bigger than a hare!" [...] Hirst exclaimed with genuine excitement. [...] "What an ass I was not <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>my</b> Kodak!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But why,' exclaimed Bobino, 'does he {{want me to}} die? What evil have I done him, or what fault have I {{committed}} that {{he should}} wish <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> about <b>my</b> death?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} go below, and change your things. Tell the steward <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> me <b>my</b> oilskins, {{out of my}} cabin. You had better keep below, until this rain has stopped." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I will do so, sir. Meanwhile,' he added, as one {{who felt}} he had earned {{a right to be}} heard in his turn, 'I have your {{permission}} <b>to</b> hasten <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> home <b>my</b> wife?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With pleasure, sir, but {{be so good}} as <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>my</b> {{property}} with you. She is too {{valuable to}} be left here unprotected amongst these distinguished but disappointed gentlemen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all, not at all," [...] I said. [...] "It's quite time, I dare say. But you oughtn't to {{have taken}} the trouble <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>my</b> shoes in." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'My sister, I {{have made}} you this early visit <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> you <b>my</b> little suppliant. Allow me {{to present to}} your Majesty, Madame la Vicomtesse de Bellaise, who is {{sincerely}} sorry to have offended you.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Pretzel Logic was {{the first}} Steely Dan album to feature Walter Becker on guitar. [...] "Once I met (session musician) Chuck Rainey", he explained, [...] "I felt there really {{was no need for}} me <b>to</b> be <b>bringing</b> <b>my</b> bass guitar <b>to</b> the studio anymore".|$|R
6000|$|... "If she's at {{a dinner}} party I needn't worry. Forgive the foolish question, Dad. Brennan promised <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>my</b> suit case over in the morning. I lugged the basket myself." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The Home Farm! Go {{there at}} once and meet me. Tell one of the grooms <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>my</b> horse round. No. Never mind. I'll go to the stables myself. It will save time." ...|$|E
6000|$|Aldo. So, now {{you will}} part, {{for a mere}} punctilio! Turn to him, daughter: Speak to her, son: Why should you be so {{refractory}} both, <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>my</b> gray hairs with sorrow to the grave? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is quite}} all right," [...] he assured her. [...] "Your neighbour, Mr. Windover, to whom these woods {{apparently}} belong, asked me <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>my</b> gun {{out this morning}} and try and get a woodcock." ...|$|E

2500|$|Next came Intersections (2003), {{dealing with}} the {{opportunities}} that intersections in life provide for change. McRoberts says, [...] "Much of the album's content deals with renewing the way I see the world around me; learning to recognize the eternal value in every moment, every relationship, every song, trying {{to cut through the}} utilitarian perspective I am so used <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> everyday." [...] McRoberts released Live At Grove City (2004) the following year.|$|R

It's been a great run at CBS, but I miss the pulse of a local newsroom, and, being from the Midwest, I miss being part of a community. But I wasn't going to go just anywhere. Cleveland reminds me {{a great deal of the}} city where I grew up, and I'm looking forward <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>my</b> family because I think we're going to have a really good life there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me mend them," [...] said I. [...] "I don't mind it, and he needn't know. I'd like to, he's so kind <b>to</b> {{me about}} <b>bringing</b> <b>my</b> letters and lending books." ...|$|R
