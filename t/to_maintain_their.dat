5|$|Between 1025 and 1028, the Fatimids {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with Salih's Jarrahid/Tayyi allies, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>their</b> foothold in interior Palestine, while Anushtakin was recalled to Cairo. In contrast to the Mirdasids, the Tayy consistently plundered their territory and its inhabitants. Moreover, the Fatimids would not tolerate independent rule in Palestine, which they viewed {{as a threat to}} the Caliphate's survival.|$|E

5|$|Some {{animals can}} {{navigate}} using celestial cues {{such as the}} position of the sun. Since the sun moves in the sky, navigation by this means also requires an internal clock.

5|$|The {{ability of}} sea mussels <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>their</b> grip on {{rocks in the}} ocean is {{facilitated}} by their use of organometallic iron-based bonds in their protein-rich cuticles.

The amount of stress required to permanently damage them increased 76 times.|$|E

5|$|Contrary to expectations, the American bombing effort had not {{pulverized}} the Base Areas and {{had only}} tended to drive PAVN and the NLF deeper into the Cambodian countryside.

5|$|Fur-bearing trout are fictional {{creatures that}} are purportedly found in Arkansas, {{northern}} North America, and Iceland.

Another theory says that it is due to four jugs - or two bottles - of hair tonic being spilled into the Arkansas River.|$|E

5|$|In early 348 BC, the Athenians were {{distracted by}} events on Euboea, {{and were in}} no {{position}} to send much help to Olynthos. However, the expedition the Athenians sent to Euboea to try <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>their</b> position on the island was a disaster, and the Athenians had to seek peace with Chalcis, thereby effectively losing control of the island. It is possible that Philip actually incited the revolt on Euboea, though it considered more likely that this is a misreading of a speech of the Athenian politician Aeschines.|$|E

In 1882, ongoing civil disturbances in Egypt prompted Britain to intervene, extending a hand to France. France's leading expansionist Jules Ferry was out of office, and Paris allowed London to take effective control of Egypt.|$|R

As demand fell, it left many owners in negative equity and often without the means <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>their</b> homes in reasonable condition.

5|$|Since the Ottoman army outnumbered {{the forces}} at Sigismund's disposal, he {{proposed}} the Székely commoners (who {{had been reduced}} to serfdom in the 1560s) to restore their freedom if they joined his campaign against the Ottomans. The Székelys accepted his offer, enabling Sigismund to launch a counter-invasion in Wallachia in early October. The united forces of Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia defeated the retreating Ottoman army in the Battle of Giurgiu on 25October.
