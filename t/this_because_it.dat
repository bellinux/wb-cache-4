25|$|JWST is {{the formal}} {{successor}} to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and since its primary emphasis is on infrared observation, {{it is also a}} {{successor to the}} Spitzer Space Telescope. JWST will far surpass both those telescopes, being able to see many more and much older stars and galaxies. Observing in the infrared is a key technique for achieving <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> better penetrates obscuring dust and gas, allows observation of dim cooler objects, and because of cosmological redshift. Since water vapor and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere strongly absorbs most infrared, ground-based infrared astronomy is limited to narrow wavelength ranges where the atmosphere absorbs less strongly. Additionally, the atmosphere itself radiates in the infrared, often overwhelming light from the object being observed. This makes space the ideal place for infrared observation.|$|E

500|$|After {{a role as}} the Bostonian love {{interest}} of Cornel Wilde in Humberstone's The Homestretch (1947), O'Hara had grown frustrated with Hollywood and took a considerable break {{to return to her}} native Ireland, where people thought she did not look well, having lost a lot of weight. While there she received a call from 20th Century Fox to portray the role of Doris Walker, the mother of Susan Walker (played by a young Natalie Wood) in the Christmas film, Miracle on 34th Street (1947). It became a perennial Christmas classic, with a traditional network television airing every Thanksgiving Day on NBC. On Natalie Wood, O'Hara said: [...] "I have been mother to almost forty children in movies, but I always had a special place in my heart for little Natalie. She always called me Mamma Maureen and I called her Natasha... when Natalie and I shot the scenes in Macy's, we had to do them at night because the store was full of people doing their Christmas shopping during the day. Natalie loved <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> meant she was allowed to stay up late. I really enjoyed this time with Natalie. We loved to walk through the quiet, closed store and look at all the toys and girls' dresses and shoes. The day she died, I cried shamelessly". The film garnered several awards, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.|$|E

During shooting she became ill several times due to the intense emotional effort required. However, as she told Oprah Winfrey, she was also pregnant during the filming: [...] "I was winded after every take. I had to lie on the couch every ten minutes so I could recover from dizzy spells, I was worried that I was shaking the baby around too much and that would injure it in some way." [...] Madonna wrote in her personal diary at the time: [...] "Ironically, this feeling of vulnerability and weakness is helping me in the movie.

500|$|Waugh's {{friends were}} {{generally}} {{enthusiastic about the}} book. Anthony Powell {{thought that it was}} one of Waugh's most interesting works, and Graham Greene placed it among the writer's best fiction. The Donaldsons thought that he had [...] "succeeded wonderfully" [...] in providing so vivid an account of his experiences. John Betjeman, reviewing the book for The Daily Telegraph, wrote: [...] "The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold is self-examination written as a novel, but unlike other such works, which are generally dreary and self-pitying, <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is by Mr Waugh, is readable, thrilling and detached". Other reviewers were generally more circumspect. Philip Toynbee in The Observer found it [...] "very hard to say whether it is a good book or not; it is certainly an interesting and a moving one". He sensed in Waugh's writing a [...] "change of gear", a point picked up by John Raymond in the New Statesman. Raymond thought Waugh was the only current English novelist whose work showed signs of development, and that in Pinfold had produced [...] "one of his wittiest, most humane entertainments", a work of self-revelation only marred, in Raymond's view, by an unsatisfactory conclusion. The Times Literary Supplements reviewer R.G.G. Price deemed it a [...] "thin little tale", while acknowledging that Waugh as a comic writer could reasonably be compared with P.G.

500|$|Monk {{carries out}} futile and endless {{attempts}} {{to make the world}} [...] "balanced". Monk is fixated with symmetry, {{going so far as to}} always cut his pancakes into squares. He strongly prefers familiarity and rigorous structure in his activities. Monk only drinks Sierra Springs water throughout seasons 1–5 and a fictional brand (Summit Creek) throughout seasons 6–8, to the point that in the season 2 episode [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to Mexico", Monk goes without drinking for several days because he cannot find any Sierra Springs. Monk also has great difficulty in standard social situations, so much so that he must write down common small talk phrases on note cards in an attempt to successfully socialize. While his obsessive attention to minute detail cripples him socially, it makes him a gifted detective and profiler. He has a photographic memory, and can reconstruct entire crime scenes based on little more than scraps of detail that seem unimportant to his colleagues. His trademark method of examining a crime scene, which Sharona used to call his [...] "Zen Sherlock Holmes thing", is to wander seemingly aimlessly around a crime scene, occasionally holding up his hands, as though framing a shot for a photograph. Shalhoub explained in an interview that Monk does <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> [...] "isolates and cuts the crime scene into slices" [...] and causes Monk to look at parts of the crime scene instead of the whole.|$|E
500|$|Scogin's introspective lyrics {{have covered}} topics like materialism, death, and the Nashville Christian music industry. The lyrics for Wars and Rumors of Wars were formed after a family loss: [...] "...only {{a year ago}} my father passed away. And I hate to say <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> sounds like such a band-dude thing to say, but the lyrics are a lot darker than any other record just because of how {{personal}} they are for me." [...] Scogin usually refers to his lyrics as poems and has maintained that [...] "a song is never finished but abandoned." [...] "...as an artist you can forever be changing a song or making a song 'better' or whatever but the moment that you stop recording and send it off to be mastered you have not 'finished' the song…you have only abandoned the song {{and that is how}} it will stay forever." [...] His lyrics sometimes espouse Christian themes and beliefs, albeit subtly. For example, the track [...] "Yellow Dress: Locked Knees" [...] from Everything... contains the Spanish lyrics [...] "Jesus, yo quiero que este mundo te conozca."; when translated, it says [...] "Jesus, I want this world to know You." [...] The song [...] "And Shot Each Other" [...] from The Fiancée fades out into a Sacred Harp choir singing the song 'Child of Grace', which features the lyrics [...] "How happy is a child of grace, who feels his sins forgiven / This world, he cries, is not my place / I seek a place in Heaven." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Dwight Christmas" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} story editor Robert Padnick, marking his fourth writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff in the seventh season. It was directed by Charles McDougall, his first directing credit for the season. McDougal's first job for the series was directing its first Christmas episode during the show's second season. The basic plot of the episode, involving Belsnickel, had originally been conceived during the writing for fourth season {{and was going to}} air as that year's Christmas installment. However, the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike halted production, and the unfinished script was never used. According to executive producer and showrunner Greg Daniels, the writing staff wanted to use the premise for many years, but could never find a right time to implement it, until an opportunity during the show's last season presented itself. Before the episode aired, Kemper, in an interview with TV Guide said that [...] "I feel like I might be expected to say <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is the last one, but I truly love this episode so much" [...] and that she [...] "specifically love Dwight's storyline" [...] because [...] "he brings in his family Christmas traditions. I've always held Dwight as one of my favorite characters and now 'Dwight Christmas' just takes it to a new level." [...] Fischer said that filming the last Christmas episode was [...] "emotional" [...] and regretted not being able to have Mindy Kaling, who portrayed Kelly Kapoor on the series, film a karaoke scene. This is the second episode of season nine to not feature Andy or Clark. Ed Helms, who portrayed Andy, left the show temporarily in the season's sixth episode [...] "The Boat" [...] in order to film The Hangover Part III, whereas Clark Duke, who portrayed Clark, left for a few episodes to film Kick-Ass 2.|$|E
