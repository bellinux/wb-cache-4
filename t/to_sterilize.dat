5|$|As well {{as being}} located in a region of the galaxy that is {{chemically}} advantageous {{for the development of}} life, a star must also avoid an excessive number of catastrophic cosmic events with the potential to damage life on its otherwise habitable planets. Nearby supernovae, for example, have the potential to severely harm life on a planet; with excessive frequency, such catastrophic outbursts have the potential <b>to</b> <b>sterilize</b> an entire region of a galaxy for billions of years. The galactic bulge, for example, experienced an initial wave of extremely rapid star formation, triggering a cascade of supernovae that for five billion years left that area almost completely unable to develop life.|$|E
5|$|In the interim, {{rather than}} await a decision, Ferrari {{continued}} her studies. Between 1921 and 1923 she visited many clinics in Europe, including facilities in Austria, Belgium, England, France, Germany and Italy. She {{assisted in the}} clinic of Marie Curie in Paris {{as well as in}} the Columbia Hospital for Women and Lying-In Asylum in Washington, DC. The Faculty of Medicine of Paris awarded her the first diploma ever given to a woman for studies in urinary tract monitoring. In 1924, she designed a vaginoscope, which was much easier <b>to</b> <b>sterilize</b> and was more adaptable to multiple specula than previous models. The device significantly improved services which were available to women in Brazil, and was featured in the articles of the Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics of Rio de Janeiro. The innovation won the Grand Prize at the 1924 Congreso Hispano Lusitano Americano de Ciencias Médicas held in Seville, Spain.|$|E
5|$|Shepard {{destroys the}} machine {{powering}} it and prepares {{to destroy the}} Collector base. However, the Illusive Man contacts Shepard and gives the order <b>to</b> <b>sterilize</b> the base instead with a timed radiation pulse {{so that it can}} be used against the Reapers. After deciding the fate of the base, Shepard destroys the awakened Human-Reaper and escapes with the surviving squad members. If no squad members survive, Shepard fails to escape and dies. Back on the Normandy, Shepard speaks with the Illusive Man, who is either pleased or furious with Shepard's decision. As Shepard meets in the Normandys cargo bay with the survivors, Joker gives the Commander schematics of a Reaper. Humanity now has the full attention of the Reapers, who awaken in dark space and descend upon the galaxy.|$|E

50|$|Sterilization {{has long}} been a {{controversial}} topic in the United States. Up through the 1970s, states could choose which women were allowed the procedure and which women were not eligible. This strategy proved repressive, both for women who wished <b>to</b> become <b>sterilized</b> and were not granted the right, as well as for women who had no choice but <b>to</b> become <b>sterilized.</b> Then, as today, sterilization was a form of birth control highly sought after by some women. However, until the 1960s, it was illegal for women <b>to</b> become <b>sterilized</b> for reasons other than eugenics, which meant sterilization as birth control was illegal. This left many women with highly legitimate reasons for sterilization unable to receive the procedure. It also meant most women who were undergoing the procedure were getting it for non-birth control reasons and not by choice.|$|R
50|$|Chanterelles {{can also}} be pickled in brine. Salted water is brought {{to a boil and}} {{pickling}} spices such as peppercorns, mustard seeds, and thyme are added. The mushrooms are then cooked in this solution for 5-10 minutes before being transferred <b>to</b> <b>sterilized</b> bottles along with some of the liquid. Sliced garlic and dill can be added to the bottles for extra flavor. The remaining liquid forms an excellent stock for making soup. When pickled in this way, chanterelles can last from six to twelve months.|$|R
25|$|Based on {{a report}} by {{journalist}} Natalia Antelava, doctors reported that the Ministry of Health told doctors they must perform surgical sterilizations on women. One doctor reported, “It's ruling number 1098 and it says that after two children, in some areas after three, a woman should be sterilized.”, {{in a loss of}} the former surface decency of Central Asian mores in regard of female chastity. In 2010, the Ministry of Health passed a decree stating all clinics in Uzbekistan should have sterilization equipment ready for use. The same report also states that sterilization is to be done on a voluntary basis with the informed consent of the patient. In the 2010 Human Rights Report of Uzbekistan, there were many reports of forced sterilization of women along with allegations of the government pressuring doctors <b>to</b> <b>sterilize</b> women in order to control the population. Doctors also reported to Antelava that there are quotas they must reach every month on how many women they need <b>to</b> <b>sterilize.</b> These orders are passed on to them through their bosses and, allegedly, from the government.|$|E

Japan's Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo was {{the first}} to implement what have come to be identified as Keynesian economic policies: first, by large fiscal stimulus involving deficit spending; and second, by devaluing the currency. Takahashi used the Bank of Japan <b>to</b> <b>sterilize</b> the deficit spending and minimize resulting inflationary pressures.

25|$|Ultraviolet light {{irradiation}} (UV, from a germicidal lamp) {{is useful for}} sterilization of surfaces and some transparent objects. Many objects that are transparent to visible light absorb UV. UV irradiation is routinely used <b>to</b> <b>sterilize</b> the interiors of biological safety cabinets between uses, but is ineffective in shaded areas, including areas under dirt (which may become polymerized after prolonged irradiation, {{so that it is}} very difficult to remove).

25|$|India {{experiences}} large capital inflows every day, {{and even}} though the OMO and the LAF policies were able to withhold the inflows, another instrument was needed to keep the liquidity intact. Thus, on the recommendations of the Working Group of RBI on instruments of Sterilization (December, 2003), a new scheme known as the Market stabilization scheme (MSS) was set up. The LAF and the OMO’s were dealing with day-to-day liquidity management, whereas the MSS was set up <b>to</b> <b>sterilize</b> the liquidity absorption and make it more enduring.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet lamps {{are used}} <b>to</b> <b>sterilize</b> workspaces and tools used in biology {{laboratories}} and medical facilities. Commercially available low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps emit about 86% of their radiation at 254 nanometers (nm), with 265nm being the peak germicidal effectiveness curve. UV at these germicidal wavelengths damage a microorganism's DNA {{so that it}} cannot reproduce, making it harmless, (even though the organism may not be killed). Since microorganisms can be shielded from ultraviolet rays in small cracks and other shaded areas, these lamps are used only {{as a supplement to}} other sterilization techniques.|$|E
25|$|Common {{hospital}} disinfectants are ineffective against C. difficile spores and, in fact, may promote spore formation, however, disinfectants {{containing a}} 10:1 ratio {{of water to}} bleach effectively kill the spores.
