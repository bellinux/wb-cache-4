50|$|Comet Morehouse (modern formal designation: C/1908 R1) was a bright, non-periodic comet {{discovered}} by US astronomer Daniel Walter Morehouse and first observed on September 1, 1908.

At times, the tail seemed to split into up to six separate tails; at others, the <b>tail</b> <b>appeared</b> completely detached from the head of the comet. The tail was further unusual in that it formed while the comet was still 2 AU away from the Sun (where distances of 1.5 AU are more usual), and that there was a high concentration of the CO+ ion in its spectrum.|$|E

50|$|An ancestral state {{reconstruction}} conducted {{along with}} the phylogenetic analysis (results labelled in the above phylogenetic tree) suggests that wing feather asymmetry likely evolved once, at the common ancestor of the Paraves. Meanwhile, asymmetrical tail feathers likely also evolved once, at the common ancestor of all paravians excluding scansoriopterygids and avialans. However, given the uncertainty of whether dromaeosaurids possessed asymmetrical wing feathers, an alternative result finds equivocal support for a single emergence of asymmetrical wing feathers in the common ancestor of the Paraves. The distinct possibility remains that troodontids had asymmetrical tail feathers but symmetrical arm feathers, suggesting that asymmetry in the <b>tail</b> <b>appeared</b> first, {{but this is not}} supported by the ancestral state reconstruction.|$|E
5000|$|Rev.

In 1702, Anton van Leeuwenhoek gave a detailed description of Rotifer vulgaris and subsequently described Melicerta ringens and other species. He was also the first to publish observations of the revivification of certain species after drying. Other forms were described by other observers, but it wasn't until the publication of Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg's Die Infusionsthierchen als vollkommene Organismen in 1838 that the rotifers were recognized as being multicellular animals.|$|E

The two-seater single-engine fixed-wing Giles G-202, a homebuilt aircraft, assembled from a kit, was completing dramatic climbs and dives as a crowd of mostly journalists watched below. Around 2 p.m., as the pilot went into a dive followed by a steep corkscrew climb, part of the <b>tail</b> <b>appeared</b> to break off, witnesses said and photographs indicated. The plane then crossed the crowd line and spun over the heads of spectators, crashing in a wooded area behind the crowd.

The National Transportation Safety Board and the New York State Police were to investigate to determine the crash’s probable cause, the state police and Federal Aviation Administration said.|$|E
