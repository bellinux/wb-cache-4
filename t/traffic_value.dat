50|$|The {{practical}} {{measurement of}} traffic is typically based on continuous observations over several days or weeks, {{during which the}} instantaneous traffic is recorded at regular, short intervals (such as every few seconds). These measurements are then used to calculate a single result, most commonly the busy hour traffic (in erlangs). This is {{the average number of}} concurrent calls during a given one-hour period of the day, where that period is selected to give the highest result. (This result is called the time-consistent busy hour traffic). An alternative is to calculate a busy hour <b>traffic</b> <b>value</b> separately for each day (which may correspond to slightly different times each day) and take the average of these values. This generally gives a slightly higher value than the time-consistent busy hour value.|$|E
50|$|Where the {{existing}} busy-hour carried traffic, Ec, is measured on an already-overloaded system, {{with a significant}} level of blocking, {{it is necessary to}} take account of the blocked calls in estimating the busy-hour offered traffic Eo (which is the <b>traffic</b> <b>value</b> {{to be used in the}} Erlang formula). The offered traffic can be estimated by Eo = Ec/(1 &minus; Pb). For this purpose, where the system includes a means of counting blocked calls and successful calls, Pb can be estimated directly from the proportion of calls that are blocked. Failing that, Pb can be estimated by using Ec in place of Eo in the Erlang formula and the resulting estimate of Pb can then be used in Eo = Ec/(1 &minus; Pb) to estimate Eo. Another method of estimating Eo in an overloaded system is to measure the busy-hour call arrival rate, λ (counting successful calls and blocked calls), and the average call-holding time (for successful calls), h, and then estimate Eo using the formula E = λh.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Measurements of {{high-speed}} network traffic {{have shown that}} traffic data exhibits {{a high degree of}} self-similarity. Traditional traffic models such as AR and ARMA are not able to capture this long-range-dependence making them ineffective for the traffic prediction task. In this paper, we apply the fractional ARIMA (F-ARIMA) model to predict one-step-ahead <b>traffic</b> <b>value</b> at different time scales. F-ARIMA has the ability to capture both the short- and long-range dependent characteristics of the underlying data. We present a simplified adaptive prediction scheme to reduce the F-ARIMA computational complexity. The performance of the proposed F-ARIMA prediction model is tested on four different types of traffic data: MPEG and JPEG video, Ethernet and Internet. We also apply the F-ARIMA prediction model to a dynamic bandwidth allocation scheme. The results show that the performance of F-ARIMA outperforms the AR models. They also show that the prediction performance depends on the traffic nature and the time scale. Keywords- traffic prediction; self-similar; F-ARIMA; dynamic bandwidth allocation. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-QoS routing {{solutions}} can {{be classified}} into two cate-gories, state-dependent and time-dependent, according to their awareness of the future traffic demand in the network. Com-pared with representative state-dependent routing algorithms, a time-dependent variation of WSP – TDWSP – is proposed in this paper to study the role of traffic forecasting in QoS routing, by customizing itself {{for a range of}} traffic demands. Our simulation results confirm the feasibility of traffic forecasting in the context of QoS routing, which empowers TDWSP to achieve better routing performance and to overcome QoS routing difficulties, even though completely accurate traffic prediction is not required. The case study involving TDWSP further reveals that even a static forecast can remain effective over a large area in the solvable traffic demand space, if the network topology and the peak <b>traffic</b> <b>value</b> are given. Thus, the role of traffic forecasting in QoS routing becomes more prominent. Keywords-QoS routing, time-dependent routing, forecast I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{presence}} of the complex scaling behavior in network traffic makes accurate forecasting of the traffic a challenging task. Some conventional prediction tools such as recursive least square method {{do not apply to}} network traffic prediction. In this paper we propose a multiscale decomposition approach to real time traffic prediction. The raw traffic data is first decomposed into multiple timescales using the à trous Haar wavelet transform. The prediction of the wavelet coefficients and scaling coefficients are performed independently at each timescale using ARIMA model. The predicted wavelet coefficients and scaling coefficient are then combined to give the predicted <b>traffic</b> <b>value.</b> This multiscale decomposition approach can better capture the correlation structure of traffic caused by different network mechanisms, which may not be obvious when examining the raw data directly. The proposed prediction algorithm is applied to real network traffic. It is shown that the proposed algorithm generally outperforms traffic prediction using neural network approach and gives more accurate result. The complexity of the prediction algorithm is also significantly lower than that using neural network. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of adding multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) support to transport networks {{is considered an}} important opportunity by telecom carriers that want to add packet services and applications to their networks. However, the {{question that arises is}} whether it is suitable to have MPLS nodes just {{at the edge of the}} network to collect packet traffic from users, or also to introduce MPLS facilities on a subset of the core nodes in order to exploit packet switching flexibility and multiplexing, thus providing induction of a better bandwidth allocation. In this article, we address this complex decisional problem with the support of a mathematical programming approach. We consider two-layer networks where MPLS is overlaid on top of transport networks—synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) or wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) —depending on the required link speed. The discussions’ decisions take into account the trade-off between the cost of adding MPLS support in the core nodes and the savings in the link bandwidth allocation due to the statistical multiplexing and the traffic grooming effects induced by MPLS nodes. The traffic matrix specifies for each point-to-point request a pair of values: a mean <b>traffic</b> <b>value</b> and an additional one. Using this traffic model, the effect of statistical multiplexing on a link allows the allocation of a capacity equal to the sum of all the mean values of the traffic demands routed on the link and only the highest additional one.

40|$|The {{underwater}} sound environment {{in shallow water}} area was complicated by time and depth under the influences of the biological and artificial noises from land and sea, e. g., trains, cars, feeding, cruising boats, etc. The {{purpose of this study}} is to clarify the underwater noise background and the {{underwater sound}} environment weighted by auditory sensation of fish in Kagoshima Bay. The emitted noise by drifting and cruising vessels has the largest influence on the underwater sound environment in shallow water area. There were recorded the vertical underwater noise by drifting vessel and approaching noise by cruising vessel. The transmission rays of underwater noise by drifting vessel have two directions, i. e., direct and reflected rays; interference occurs while receiving the two direction sound waves with a hydrophone simultaneously. As an interference theory of underwater sound in shallow water was obtained as an equation with the range of transmission rays from drifting and cruising vessels to hydrophone for the reflection number. A comparison between theoretical and actual interference was made with a measurement of the ambient noise and <b>traffic</b> <b>value</b> in the heavy traffic area of Kagoshima Port. It was confirmed that the main noise was emitted by vessels, and the characteristic noise was temporal and sharply increased. In the biological noise, the underwater sounds measured in net cages at a culture ground were analyzed by the zerocrossing method to obtain the period change, power, and continuation time of swimming sounds by fish. The audiogram of a bastard halibut Paralichthys olivaceus was measured by a classical respiratory conditioning technique. The hearing response of bastard halibut was also measured by sweeping sound, and clarified the upper limit frequency of hearing. The lowest threshold of bastard halibut was at about 100 Hz and the threshold increased rapidly at 200 - 400 Hz. The ambient noises are mainly broadband and appears under 3 kHz of fine auditory sensation in fish. The hearing ability differs among fishes, thereby the underwater sound environment also differs. Arrangement was made on the frequency-weighted characteristics for auditory sensation of fish, fish weighting using these audiograms, in comparison with the underwater sound environment and underwater noise level of each fish. The fish weighting of bastard halibut is a type of low frequency with narrow band; the underwater noise level is strongly affected by emphasis on the interference level of low frequency. The fish weighting of a Japanese horse mackerel Trachurus japonicus is a type of high frequency with wide band; the underwater sound environment is influenced by the interference with wide band, but a small effect on variation of the underwater noise level. ...|$|E
