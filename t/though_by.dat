5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{left the}} African coast on July22 and crossed {{much of the}} Atlantic without significant development. While approaching the Leeward Islands on July28, the National Hurricane Center monitored the system closely for any possible development, which did not occur at that time. <b>Though</b> <b>by</b> August2, convection began increasing, and as a result, the system developed into Tropical Depression Eight later that day, while centered about 350miles (595km) southwest of Bermuda. On the following day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Harvey. Due to initially strong wind shear, Harvey exhibited subtropical characteristics.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, the Castillonnais {{was officially}} {{recognized}} by the French Ministry of Agriculture, due {{to the efforts of}} a small number of breed enthusiasts, <b>though</b> <b>by</b> that time only 50 purebred mares remained.

Le Conservatoire du Patrimoine Biologique Régional de Midi-Pyrénées (Conservatory of the Biological Heritage of the Midi-Pyrénées Region), an organization that has worked to protect the diversity of animal species in the region since 1980, is also committed to protecting the breed.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{looking for}} ways to further improve its {{electronic}} forms software, in November 1991 Delrina had attempted to buy two associated firms that produced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software, with the intention of incorporating OCR functionality into its forms products.

This functionality was incorporated into WinFax PRO 3.0 in late 1992, and subsequently in FormFlow Despite the agreement with Caere, the subsequent version of WinFax used Xerox's TextBridge OCR engine instead.|$|E

5|$|The services, {{the first}} of its kind in the UK, opened at the same time as the new {{motorway}} on 2 November 1959.

Civil engineer Owen Williams visited the United States to see what existing rest areas were available, and based his designs on these. Watford Gap was chosen as one of four pilot sites, <b>though</b> <b>by</b> 1958 the Ministry had decided only this and Newport Pagnell services would open with the motorway.|$|E

5|$|The {{vessel was}} {{employed}} as a training ship starting in 1912, primarily for cadets from the US Naval Academy. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Wisconsins training duties expanded to engine room personnel. She was also assigned to the Coast Battleship Patrol Squadron. She {{took part in a}} naval review in December 1918 after the war ended. She served briefly with the fleet in 1919, <b>though</b> <b>by</b> May 1920, she was decommissioned.
