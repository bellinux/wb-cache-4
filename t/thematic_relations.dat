As Gallagher gradually gained more control over Megatokyos production, the comic began to gain more similarities to the Japanese sh≈çjo manga that Gallagher enjoys.

5000|$|In linguistics, a {{grammatical}} {{agent is}} a <b>thematic</b> <b>relation</b> {{that refers to}} the cause or initiator of an event. The agent is a semantic concept distinct from {{the subject of a}} sentence. While the subject is determined syntactically, primarily through word order, the agent is determined through its relationship to the action expressed by the verb. The word comes from the present participle agens, agentis ("the one doing") of the Latin verb agere, to [...] "do" [...] or [...] "make".|$|R
50|$|Ditransitive verbs {{have two}} {{arguments}} {{other than the}} subject: a theme that undergoes the action and a recipient that receives the theme (see <b>thematic</b> <b>relation).</b> In a secundative language, the recipient of a ditransitive verb is treated {{in the same way}} as the single object of a monotransitive verb, and this syntactic category is called primary object, which is equivalent to the indirect object in English. The theme of a ditransitive verb is treated separately and called secondary object, which is equivalent to the direct object.|$|R
50|$|<b>Thematic</b> <b>relations</b> {{concern the}} nature of the {{relationship}} between the meaning of the verb and the meaning of the noun.

5000|$|A theta-role is {{a status}} of <b>thematic</b> <b>relation</b> [...] In other words, a theta-role {{describes}} {{the connection of}} meaning between a predicate or a verb and a constituent selected by this predicate. The number, types and positions of theta-roles that a lexicon assigns is encoded in its lexical entry [...] and must be satisfied in syntactic structure following Projection Principle. The selection of a constituent by a head based on meaning is called s-selection (semantic-selection) and those based on grammatical categories are called c-selection.

To make matters more confusing, depending upon which theoretical approach one assumes, the grammatical relations of subject and object, etc., are often {{closely tied to the}} semantic relations. For example, in the typological tradition agents/actors (or [...] "agent-like" [...] arguments) frequently overlap with the notion of subject (S). Here is a way to distinguish these ideas, when they are used distinctly: ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Thematic</b> <b>relations</b> are purely {{semantic}} {{descriptions of}} the way in which the entities described by the noun phrase are functioning with respect to the meaning of the action described by the verb. A noun may bear more than one thematic relation.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show that current HPSG binding theory (and {{similarly}} other binding approaches en coding asymmetries explicitly) is inadequate with regard to describing binding variabilities in local binding contexts. This inadequacy stems mainly from the usage of too restrictive and order-independent obliqueness ba sed hierarchies as constraints on possible binders and bindees. We propose binding constraints to be directly implemented as path equations/path in-equations in <b>thematic</b> <b>relation</b> sorts. This allows a more fine-grained des cription of local binding symmetries and asymmetries via a mo dular interplay of general binding conditions on thematic arguments together with linear precedence constraints on certain anaphoric elements. 1...|$|R

The authors analyzed the characteristics of the concept generation process by comparing between the linguistic interpretation task and design task, from the viewpoints of the thought types (analogy, blending, and <b>thematic</b> <b>relation)</b> and recognition types (commonality, alignable difference and nonalignable difference). In our experiment, the subjects were required to interpret a novel noun-noun phrase, create a design concept from the same noun-noun phrase, and list the similarities and dissimilarities between the two nouns. The results reveal that blending and nonalignable difference are important factors of the creative concept generation process...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an event {{semantic}} {{analysis for the}} inalienable possession construction which {{takes the form of}} a multiple object structure. The inalienable possession interpretation has its root in the material part-whole relation between events, rather than in the direct <b>thematic</b> <b>relation</b> between the whole and the part NPs. This semantic relation is syntactically realized as a recursive VP structure with two different verbs. We argue that the higher verb is a phonologically silent verb affect, while the lower verb is a lexical verb. The possessee is an argument of the lexical verb. The possessor, in contrast, is an argument of the higher verb affect. The proposed analysis overcomes the challenges that the previous analyses face. ...|$|R

5000|$|Drawing on {{observations}} {{based in}} typological cross-linguistic comparisons of languages , linguists in the relational grammar (RG) tradition (e.g. [...] observed that particular <b>thematic</b> <b>relations</b> and theta roles map on to particular {{positions in the}} sentence. For example, in unmarked situations agents map to subject positions, themes onto object position, and goals onto indirect objects. In RG, this is encoded in the Universal Alignment Hypothesis (or UAH), where the <b>thematic</b> <b>relations</b> are mapped directly into argument position based on the following hierarchy: Agent < Theme < Experiencer < Others. Mark Baker adopted this idea into GB theory {{in the form of}} the Uniformity of Theta Assignment Hypothesis (or UTAH) [...] UTAH explains how identical thematic relationships between items are shown by identical structural relationships. A different approach to the correspondence is given in [...] and , where there are no such things as underlying theta roles or even <b>thematic</b> <b>relations.</b> Instead, the interpretive component of the grammar identifies the semantic role of an argument based on its position in the tree.|$|E
40|$|One way {{in which}} new {{concepts}} {{are added to the}} conceptual system is through conceptual combination. The competition-among-relations-in-nominals (CARIN) theory (Gagn√© & Shoben, 1997) proposes that conceptual combination involves specifying a <b>thematic</b> <b>relation</b> (e. g., noun MADE OF modifier) to link the constituent concepts (e. g., chocolate and bee). This theory claims that relations have different strengths for various concepts that correspond to how often a modifier and relation have been paired in previous encounters with combined concepts and that this relational knowledge strongly affects the ease with which combined concepts can be formed. A mathematical model that incorporates key claims of the theory is presented, and empirical findings that are relevant to evaluating the CARIN theory are reviewed. The parallels between the CARIN theory and approaches to stimulus class formation are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Hausa is {{a native}} {{language}} of an ethnic group who call themselves Hausawa. The Hausas are basically the dominant ethnic group in an area known as the Hausa land in Nigeria, some part of Niger, and other African countries. It is evident that various researchers have provided some extensive descriptions of the grammar of the language, but <b>thematic</b> <b>relation,</b> {{which is one of}} the important theories in syntax within Generative Grammar, appeared to be neglected, as none of the available literature discussed the theta role using Radford‚Äüs theory. Theta role is precisely the semantic relationship between the verb and arguments. The study was concerned with developing a structural knowledge in the syntactical studies with special emphasis on analyzing the thematic roles in Hausa sentences. It described Hausa sentences and it constituent by examining the possibility of applying the principle of theta criteria in Hausa sentence structure with a view to better understanding of the concept of thematic role and it application. The study went further to investigate the relationship between thematic roles and arguments structure of verbs found in the language. However, the analysis involved the explanation of Hausa verb, its types and function in relation with the arguments or participants in the phrases, clauses, and sentences. The data of this study was collected through interview which has been conducted to a Hausa native speaker, Radford (2009) theory of <b>thematic</b> <b>relation</b> used as a theoretical framework as well as analytical framework. The findings show that the thematic roles provide valuable information in knowing the number of arguments that are required by a particular verb. From the analysis, the result show that the entire theta role presented in Radford (2009) and many more have been found from the data, the theta role of Agent is the most common and frequent role in the data. The analysis shows that theta role exists in some sentential constructions with zero verbs...|$|R
5000|$|... theta roles: The verb [...] "give" [...] {{requires}} three arguments (see valency). In generative grammar, this is {{encoded in}} terms of the number and type of theta roles the verb takes. The theta role is named by the most prominent thematic relation associated with it. So the three required arguments bear the theta roles (confusingly!) named the agent (Reggie) the patient (or theme) (the kibble), and goal/recipient (Fergus). [...] "On Friday" [...] does not receive a theta role from the verb, because it is an adjunct. Note that [...] "Reggie" [...] bears two <b>thematic</b> <b>relations</b> (Agent and Source), but only one theta role (the argument slot associated with these <b>thematic</b> <b>relations).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "theta role" [...] {{is often}} used interchangeably with the term <b>thematic</b> <b>relations</b> (particularly in {{mainstream}} generative grammar‚Äîfor an exception see [...] ). The {{reason for this is}} simple: theta roles typically reference <b>thematic</b> <b>relations.</b> In particular, theta roles are often referred to by the most prominent thematic relation in them. For example, a common theta role is the primary or external argument. Typically, although not always, this theta role maps to a noun phrase which bears an agent thematic relation. As such, the theta role is called the [...] "agent" [...] theta role. This often leads to confusion between the two notions. The two concepts, however, can be distinguished in a number of ways.|$|E
5000|$|Only {{arguments}} of the verb bear theta roles; optional adjunct modifiers - {{even if they are}} prepositional phrases (PPs) such as on Friday or noun phrases (NPs) like yesterday - don't take theta roles. But almost all NPs (except expletives) express <b>thematic</b> <b>relations.</b>|$|E

However, it was considered that this cut-off point must be established by identifying the maximum permissible error of the <b>thematic</b> <b>relation</b> of the publication. The higher the cut-off point the greater the precision in the selection of publications, although this precision means a reduced volume, and if not, a low cut-off point increases the error in the selection and its volume. Once the cut-off point is established, all publications that exceed this threshold will be considered in the categorization of the emerging discipline.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has established that readers‚Äô eye movements {{are sensitive to}} the difficulty with which a word is processed. One important factor that influences processing is the fit of a word within the wider context, including its plausibility. Here we explore the influence of plausibility in counterfactual language processing. Counterfactuals describe hypothetical versions of the world but are grounded in the implication that the described events are not true. We report an eye-tracking study that examined the processing of counterfactual premises that varied the plausibility of a described action and manipulated the narrative perspective (‚Äúyou‚Äù vs. ‚Äúhe/she‚Äù). Results revealed a comparable pattern to previous plausibility experiments. Readers were sensitive to the inconsistent <b>thematic</b> <b>relation</b> in anomalous and implausible conditions. The fact that these anomaly detection effects were evident within a counterfactual frame suggests that participants were evaluating incoming information within the counterfactual world and did not suspend processing based on an inference about reality. Interestingly, perspective modulated the speed with which anomalous but not implausible words were detected. </p...|$|R
