Brokamp, with no previous arts experience, began to turn the school around.

25|$|The model {{minority}} concept {{can also}} affect Asians' public education. By {{comparison with other}} minorities, Asians often achieve higher <b>test</b> <b>scores</b> <b>and</b> grades compared to other Americans. Stereotyping Asian American as over-achievers can lead to harm if school officials or peers expect all to perform higher than average. The very high educational attainments of Asian Americans has often been noted; in 1980, for example, 74% of Chinese Americans, 62% of Japanese Americans, and 55% of Korean Americans aged 20–21 were in college, compared to {{only a third of}} the whites. The disparity at postgraduate levels is even greater, and the differential is especially notable in fields making heavy use of mathematics. By 2000, a plurality of undergraduates at such elite public California schools as UC Berkeley and UCLA, which are obligated by law to not consider race as a factor in admission, were Asian American. The pattern is rooted in the pre-World War II era. Native-born Chinese and Japanese Americans reached educational parity with majority whites {{in the early decades of}} the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Donald McAdams {{wrote that}} in the 1990s, within trustee District 5 there were schools that were about 50% White that usually had ample parent support and {{stronger}} test scores while there were schools about 90% or higher minorities that had low <b>test</b> <b>scores</b> <b>and</b> little to no parent support. He explained that in Houston white parents sent children to HISD schools that had minority children {{as long as the}} minority children tended to be middle class and that there was not too many of them. Many black students who lived in District 5 were middle class children who took school buses to the schools and did not live in the school zones. According to McAdams their enrollment levels were stable and White parents were comfortable with their presence. He added that very poor black children tended to go to their neighborhood schools outside of District 5. McAdams also stated that White middle class parents did not consider Asians and Asian Americans to be minorities who could make a school less attractive to them. In the 1980s and 1990s increased enrollment of poor, non-English speaking Central American students at some HISD neighborhood schools made them unattractive to White parents.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{study by}} Earl Hunt {{published}} in the journal Intelligence found that sex differences on tests can result from recruitment factors, so that gender differences are only representative of those that actually participate in the studies. He also contested that not only can there be individual variations that studies consistently recruit, but that these studies wouldn't be representative of the general population especially if the participants only represent college students. A 2009 study by researcher Dominika Dykiert published Intelligence also found that sex differences in mean IQ scores can be partly created by male variability in cognitive abilities and sample restriction. Dykiert highlighted the need for representative samples for studying sex differences in intelligence to eliminate skewed results created by male variance and restriction of sample. Studies have also indicated that tests used to measure sex differences such as Raven's Progressive matrices is not a pure indicator of general intelligence or g factor and only shares 50% of its variance. Tests like WAIS have also been criticized as not directly measuring g factor in a 2002 study published in Intelligence. Lead researcher Roberto Colom has strongly asserted that g factor or general intelligence is the correlation among different <b>test</b> <b>scores</b> <b>and</b> not the summed scores on different tests, such as Raven's or WAIS. Roberto Colom has also pointed out that Raven's Progressive matrices test is biased against females because of the visuospatial nature of the test which tends to favor those with stronger visuospatial skills (i.e. males) instead of g factor. Therefore, he concluded that sex difference research should not be based on a single test but instead on multiple tests loaded with fluid intelligence.|$|E
