To answer this question a bargain-theoretic approach is adopted and a tariff-endogenous general equilibrium model of a small open political economy is derived.

40|$|In {{the late}} 1980 s, grain-hauling railroads began {{offering}} alternatives {{that have made}} shipping decisions more strategic. Shippers now confront alternatives ranging from nearby and unguaranteed ordering to various durations of forward and guaranteed shipment. Each has varying penalties for cancellation and payments from the railroad for nonperformance, and differing risks and payoffs. Because of the configuration of choices, shippers confront a portfolio of shipping alternatives. A dynamic stochastic simulation model was developed to analyze alternative strategies. The model includes the effects of uncertainties in <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> <b>changes,</b> car premiums, basis levels, forward and spot grain purchases, and receiving railcars under each of three alternatives. Shipping demand is determined by inter-month commodity price differences, carrying costs, transport costs, and storage capacity. Considering these factors, the shipper chooses grain sales and shipping strategies that maximize net payoffs and confronts a tradeoff between expected profits and risk. Agribusiness,...|$|E

Understanding the complexity of China’s dynamic adjustment resulting from its membership in the WTO and the differential regional impacts within China is very important and poses crucial challenge in evaluating its impacts. In this study, we make an attempt to incorporate seven regional commodity-detailed models into a highly dis-aggregated China Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) framework. This framework has allowed us to evaluate the impacts of China’s integration into WTO at both national and regional levels and analyze the inter- linkages between China’s provincial agricultural markets. Using the framework and assumptions about factor mobility, we assess the impacts on China’s agricultural and non-agricultural sectors (regionally and nationally) by reduction of its trade policy distortions, such as <b>tariffs</b> <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> and quantitative restrictions. We also evaluate the structural changes on China’s national and regional production and trade as China implements its commitments and moves into WTO...|$|R

Rather than using data on volume of trade, this paper employs a 3 -dimensional panel of prices of 95 very disaggregated goods (e. g., light bulbs) in 83 cities around the world during 1990 - 2000. We find {{that the impact of}} an institutional stabilization-currency board or dollarization-promotes market integration far beyond an instrumental stabilization.

Firstly, the omission of bilateral <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> seems {{not to be so}} serious in terms of omitted-variable biases because the coefficients for the usual gravity variables do not change before or after their inclusion. Secondly, while the widely-used dummy variable of regional trade agreement could not play an alternative role in place of <b>tariff</b> <b>rates,</b> the inclusion of time-invariant pair fixed effects in addition to the time-variant importer fixed effects and exporter fixed effects accounts for the omission of <b>tariff</b> <b>rates.</b> The inclusion of those fixed effects makes the coefficient for bilateral <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> insignificant.

40|$|Recently, FTA between Korea and China is an {{important}} issue, and many researchers try to estimate the effects of FTA to abolish or decrease the <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> on their trade. In {{order to understand the}} effects of the FTA, we analyze the relationships between the extent of Intra-Industry Trade (IIT) in Korea and China and their <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> variables. In detail, we use the Factional Logit Regression Model (FLRM) using QMLE as well as OLS with logistic transformation which has been used in the existing literatures.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{properties}} of an external <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> set by a government in a free trade area (FTA) may change drastically when endogenizing foreign direct investment (FDI) policy. We use a three-country model which is a FTA variant of the “third country model ” of the strategic trade policy. We assume that firms outside the FTA may supply, either by export or by FDI, homogeneous goods to the home market and that the home government can choose a fixed cost, as a FDI policy, that outside firms must incur {{in order to have}} production plants in the home country. First, when FDI cost is exogenous, if that cost is sufficiently low, the optimal external <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> is the critical rate at which the outside firms switch their supply mode from export to FDI. This <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> is lower when the demand in the home market is larger and/or the difference in marginal costs is larger between inside and outside firms. Furthermore, this optimal <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> will be lower when the number of outside firms is smaller while the effects of the number of inside firms is ambiguous. Second, when FDI policy is endogenously determined, the optimal external <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> is the <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> at which the home welfare is maximized when outside firms choose export. In contrast to the case of exogenous FDI policy, this <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> is higher when th...|$|R

Similarly, exports of machinery parts are negatively associated with not only the importer's <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> on machinery parts but also the exporter's <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> on finished machinery products.

40|$|If {{one takes}} the {{pair-wise}} definition of equivalence, that a quota will {{give rise to}} an implicit <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> which, if alternatively set as a tariff, will generate {{the same level of}} imports as the quota, it is unambiguously clear that equivalence breaks down when there is monopoly import under both tariff and quota. An explicit tariff will not lead to an import level which, if set alternatively as a quota, will generate an implicit tariff equal to the explicit tariff; nor will a quota lead to an implicit tariff which, if set alternatively as an explicit tariff, will generate the same level of imports. In the case when foreign supply is monopolistic, the implicit <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> is zero under the quota but setting the actual <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> at zero and removing the quota restriction will not yield the same level of imports and domestic production; the truly equivalent <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> is higher.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent of}} pass-through of exchange <b>rate</b> and <b>tariff</b> <b>changes</b> into import prices using sectoral panel data (at the 2 -digit SITC level) for the post-reform period in India (1990 - 2001). After having controlled for unobserved effects that might {{have an impact on}} the import prices by using sector dummies, we find that on average exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) is a dominant effect compared to <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> pass-through (TRPT) in explaining changes in India’s import prices. The sectoral panel results suggest that the pass-through of exchange <b>rates</b> and <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> varies across products. ERPT into import prices is significant in 12 industries, whereas TRPT is significant only in 6 industries, with full pass-through. However, ERPT is incomplete only in 4 industries, but TRPT is incomplete in 36 industries, which means that firms exporting to India more frequently adopt strategies to maintain their market share against tariffs than against exchange <b>rate</b> <b>changes.</b> The sectoral differences in pass-through seem to be related to the sector’s share in total imports and the sector’s effective protection rate. Hence India’s relatively high levels of protection {{have an impact on the}} behaviour of foreign exporters. ...|$|R
