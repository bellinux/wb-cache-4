25|$|In the United States, {{there have}} been three major {{policies}} addressing special education in the United States. These policies were the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975, <b>the</b> <b>Individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>Disabilities</b> <b>Education</b> Act in 1997, and the No Child Left Behind in 2001. The development of these policies showed increased guidelines for special education and requirements; such as requiring states to fund special education, equality of opportunities, help with transitions after secondary schooling, requiring extra qualifications for special education teachers, and creating a more specific class setting for those with disabilities. <b>The</b> <b>Individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>Disabilities</b> <b>Education</b> Act, specifically had a large impact on special education as public schools were then required to employ high qualified staff. For one to be a Certified Autism Specialist, one must have a master's degree, two years of career experience working with the autism population, earn 14 continuing education hours in autism every two years, and register with the International Institute of Education. In 1993, Mexico passed an education law that called for the inclusion of those with disabilities. This law was very important for Mexico education, however, {{there have been}} issues in implementing it {{due to a lack of}} resources.|$|E

Mead and Mark A. Paige described Rowley as [...] "the primary precedent whenever the educational rights of children with disabilities are considered." [...] Likewise, in a 2012 article, Mark C. Weber wrote that Rowley [...] "remains the most important American special education case ever decided." [...] Joyce O. Eckrem and Eliza J. McArthur stated in 2001 that Rowley {{has been described as a}} [...] "seminal case", though they also recognized that the case did not [...] "provide clarity on the issue of appropriateness" [...] and that the Court only [...] "cryptically addressed" [...] the question of how to measure benefits for students.
