25|$|In 1961, the {{government}} decided to introduce decimal currency into the country. This necessitated the surcharging of stamps to reflect this change. Six stamps were chosen from various issues and overprinted {{with the following}} denominations: 1 paisa, 2 paisas, 3 paisas, 7 paisas, 13 paisas (2 designs). Their printing was divided between two local printers, both based in Karachi: Pakistan Security Printing Corporation (PSPC) and Time Press, Karachi. Times Press used many plates for printing which resulted in varieties and shifts. Service stamps with decimal surcharges were also printed by the same printers. Forgeries in this issue exist in such numbers that they make the average person <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> more errors and varieties than in fact. In the 2 paisas Service stamps, errors including service on front and surcharge on gum side are forgeries.|$|E

[...] He was also critical of the Scientology organization leadership, including its head David Miscavige: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> probably things of Scientology that are valuable and that can help people - my main issue is not with Scientology per se, it is with Scientology the organization - it is a corrupt I believe and probably a criminal endeavor, and that has to do with people who are in charge of Scientology mainly David Miscavige..." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to some {{scholars}} the statues were sculpted {{in order to}} give a monumental character to the necropolis and placed immediately on top of the tombs. Others <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no evidences in favour of this hypothesis and that the statues originally were guarding a temple building, dating to the Final Bronze Age [...] and dedicated to Sardus Pater.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Straley, a {{spokesman}} for the White House Boys, said the school segregated white and black inmates and that the remains are located where black inmates were held. He suspects there is another white cemetery that hasn't been discovered. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> at least 100 more bodies up there", he said. [...] "At some point they are going to find more bodies, I'm dead certain of that. There has to be a white graveyard on the white side." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to a Channel 4 spokeswoman, Big Brother intervened so {{the contestants}} would [...] "realise {{that what they}} have said has been misconstrued in the house". The idea, she said, was to allow the housemates [...] "to explain themselves" [...] to their fellow contestants. This was {{followed}} by a series of apologies to Shetty from the housemates, and her belief that Goody was not a racist: [...] "I don't feel there was any racial discrimination happening from Jade's end... I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> a lot of insecurities from her end but it's definitely not racial". However, Shetty was unaware of all the alleged insults (often made behind her back). Channel 4 was rebuked by Ofcom, which received more than 54,000 complaints, for its handling of the scandal.|$|E
2500|$|Swami Vivekananda warned it is {{completely}} unfair to discriminate between sexes, as there is not any sex distinction in atman (soul), the soul has neither sex, nor caste nor imperfection. He suggested not to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> men and women, but only that there are human beings. Swami Vivekananda felt, The best thermometer to the progress of a nation is its treatment of its women and {{it is impossible to}} get back India's lost pride and honor unless they try to better the condition of women. [...] Vivekananda considered men and women as two wings of a bird, and it is not possible for a bird to fly on only one wing. So, according to him, there is no chance for welfare of the world unless the condition of woman is improved.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Petrelis helped {{organize}} {{a campaign to}} reopen the bathhouses, after San Francisco Board of Supervisors member Tom Ammiano proposed an ordinance to license and regulate the city's sex clubs, thereby codifying previously voluntary guidelines. Petrelis opposed the measure as an unwarranted government intrusion into the sex lives of gay men. Among the voluntary guidelines to be codified by the legislation was a prohibition against locked doors, behind which patrons might engage in unprotected anal intercourse. San Francisco health officials considered the availability of such private spaces to be a distinguishing characteristic of the bathhouses the city had worked to close, and keep closed, since 1984. The debate over the proposed legislation led some activists to demand reopening the bathhouses. Petrelis said, [...] "...I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> mature gay men {{who know how to}} make decisions behind closed doors." [...] Ammiano's proposal failed for lack of support from San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.|$|E

From today, it is only 18 days until the carnaval starts. How it torments me to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> still so many days to go; I wish it were tomorrow;... I want you to know... that the sound of the conga nourishes me, the sound of the frying pans gives me life and the sound of the bocú drives me crazy. [...] Several days prior to the beginning of rehearsals, I went to see a doctor; I felt overwhelmed, sad, pensive. He prescribed and gave me some injections, and I felt absolutely no different, but as soon as I heard the sound of the first bocú, I was completely cured, I felt strong and ready for anything. And I advise those who are unhappy and listless to get an invigorating injection of bocú, conga and frying pans and you’ll be OK in 24 hours.” (Pérez II 1988:22-3) ...|$|E
