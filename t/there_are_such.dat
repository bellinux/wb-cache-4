Passenger and vehicle transit is handled by a number of carriers; however in 2009 Jadrolinija share of the passenger traffic volume reached 85%. In 2009, total passenger traffic volume reached 3,995,846 passengers, representing a 3.3% drop compared to the previous year. The port serves seven island ferry lines, and four additional passenger shipping lines connecting nearby islands. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> transport links to the islands of Brač and Hvarcarrying up to 2,000 and 1,000 vehicles per day during tourist seasonsas well as to islands of Vis, Lastovo, Korčula, Šolta, Drvenik Veliki, Drvenik Mali, providing regular transport links for a large area.

[...] George III was accepting of his son's relationship with the actress (though recommending that he halve her allowance); in 1797, he created William Ranger of Bushy Park, which included a large residence, Bushy House, for William's growing family. William used Bushy as his principal residence until he became king. His London residence, Clarence House, was constructed to the designs of John Nash between 1825 and 1827.|$|E

2500|$|Georgiana's nephew once {{remarked that}} she thought of {{politics}} and [...] "nothing else", while her sister cared little for it. In 1838, Lady Carlisle articulated a negative opinion of Charles Dickens, who was then emerging as a successful author. [...] "I know <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> unfortunate beings as pickpockets and streetwalkers. I am very sorry for it and am very much shocked at their mode of life, but I own I do not much wish to hear what they say to one another", she said.

2500|$|New {{scientific}} knowledge rarely results in vast {{changes in our}} understanding. According to psychologist Keith Stanovich, {{it may be the}} media's overuse of words like [...] "breakthrough" [...] that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false. While <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> famous cases as the theory of relativity that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions. Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various researchers across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap. Theories vary in {{the extent to which they}} have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community. For example, heliocentric theory, the theory of evolution, relativity theory, and germ theory still bear the name [...] "theory" [...] even though, in practice, they are considered factual.|$|E
2500|$|Although Wittgenstein {{certainly}} {{argues that}} the notion of private language is incoherent, because {{of the way in which}} the text is presented the exact nature of the argument is disputed. First, he argues that a private language is not really a language at all. [...] This point is intimately connected with a variety of other themes in his later works, especially his investigations of [...] "meaning". For Wittgenstein, there is no single, coherent [...] "sample" [...] or [...] "object" [...] that we can call [...] "meaning". Rather, the supposition that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> things is the source of many philosophical confusions. Meaning is a complicated phenomenon that is woven into the fabric of our lives. A good first approximation of Wittgenstein's point is that meaning is a social event; meaning happens between language users. As a consequence, it makes no sense to talk about a private language, with words that mean something in the absence of other users of the language.|$|E

2500|$|The French philosopher Voltaire {{wrote about}} {{capitalism}} and religious tolerance {{in his book}} on English society, Letters on the English (1733), noting why England {{at that time was}} more prosperous in comparison to the country's less religiously tolerant European neighbours.

There the Jew, the Mahometan , and the Christian transact together, as though they all professed the same religion, and give the name of infidel to none but bankrupts. There the Presbyterian confides in the Anabaptist, and the Churchman depends on the Quaker’s word.
