5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} the front wheels, is {{the most important part of}} the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>delicate</b> part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E

In 1789, a Burmese royal commission consisting of Princes and Ministers was charged with translating Siamese and Javanese dramas from Thai to Burmese. With the help of Siamese artists captured from Ayutthaya in 1767, the commission adapted two important epics from Thai to Burmese: the Siamese Ramayana and the Enao, the Siamese version of Javanese Panji tales into Burmese Yama Zattaw and Enaung Zattaw.

Nemes started working on the screenplay with Royer in 2010 and completed the first draft in 2011. The writers spent several years on research, while historians such as Gideon Greif, Philippe Mesnard and Zoltán Vági provided support for the film. Prof. Gideon Greif's book We Wept without Tears inspired director László Nemes to create a film dedicated to the Sonderkommando, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>delicate,</b> complicated and sensitive topic within the Holocaust.|$|E

25|$|In {{recent years}} {{researchers}} have developed various eye-movement simulation models {{in order to}} support, explain, and guide empirical research (the studies that collect data from experiments on human reading behaviours). Computational models can help test existing hypothesis, and also generate further predictions for empirical research to investigate. Building a reading model based on empirical data allows researchers to inspect and manipulate various assumptions of cognitive processes within the model, {{and see how the}} interactions between these elements influence the simulated reading behaviours, and hence informs further empirical studies. On the other hand, empirical research in eye-movements using eye-tracking is one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>delicate</b> measurement of human behaviours, which serves as a productive test bed for computer models of cognition. Below is a brief summary of these reading models as classified by Nuthmann (2014).|$|E

Poe had reviewed Barrett's work in the January 1845 issue of the Broadway Journal and said that [...] "her poetic inspiration is the highest– we can conceive of nothing more august. Her sense of Art is pure in itself." [...] As is typical with Poe, his review also criticizes her lack of originality and what he considers the repetitive nature of some of her poetry. About [...] "Lady Geraldine's Courtship", he said [...] "I have never read a poem combining {{so much of the}} fiercest passion with so much of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>delicate</b> imagination." ...|$|E

Despite {{the views of the}} critics, the film was one of the top ten grossing films of the year. The role earned Sellers a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy at the 22nd Golden Globe Awards, and for a Best British Actor award at the 18th British Academy Film Awards.|$|E

Much of the drapery on the bust of the image is ornamentation comprising jewellery made of pearls around her throat. An elaborate pile of curls forms her hair, some of which trails to her shoulders. [...] Above these curly tresses and behind the head is a tiered coronet of jewels, the curved edge of which rises to form a halo.

The writing in up to ten parts is extraordinarily subtle. ... The recorders additionally contribute in no small way to the spiritualised emotion and positive feelings associated with the 'sweet hour of death. Jones writes: [...] "Bach's arrival at full maturity by about {{the middle of his}} Weimar period (1713–17) is attested by the stylistic and technical assurance, and the consistently high standard, of his writing at that time." [...] He counts the cantata as one of several that reached a level of mastery unsurpassed in later years, along with the Orgelbüchlein and the cantata Ich hatte viel Bekümmernis, BWV 21, among others.|$|E

[...] The Literary Gazette called the version exhibited in 1846 [...] "by far his finest work of art", comparing the piece favourably to Rembrandt and in particularly praising Etty's ability to capture shadows and reflections in water, where [...] "in the management of these effects [...] Etty has no superior, and very few equals, in any school, from the earliest dawn of art". The Critic described it as [...] "a preeminent work" [...] and [...] "the triumph of the British school".|$|E

500|$|Director Ardolino {{encouraged}} the actors to improvise and often kept the cameras rolling, even if actors went [...] "off script". One {{example of this}} was the scene where Grey was {{to stand in front}} of Swayze with her back to him and put her arm up behind his head while he trailed his fingers down her arm (similar to the pose seen in the movie poster). Though it was written as a serious and tender moment, Grey was exhausted, found the move ticklish, and could not stop giggling each time Swayze tried it, no matter how many takes Ardolino asked for. Swayze was impatient to finish the scene and found Grey's behavior annoying. However, the producers decided the scene worked as it was and put it into the film, complete with Grey's giggling and Swayze's annoyed expression. It became one of the most famous scenes in the movie, turning out, as choreographer Kenny Ortega put it, [...] "as one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>delicate</b> and honest moments in the film." ...|$|E
