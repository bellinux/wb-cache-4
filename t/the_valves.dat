5|$|Bivalve fossils {{are formed}} when the {{sediment}} {{in which the}} shells are buried hardens into rock. Often, the impression made by <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> remains as the fossil rather than <b>the</b> <b>valves.</b> During the Early Ordovician, a great increase in the diversity of bivalve species occurred, and the dysodont, heterodont, and taxodont dentitions evolved. By the early Silurian, the gills were becoming adapted for filter feeding, and during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, siphons first appeared, which, with the newly developed muscular foot, allowed the animals to bury themselves deep in the sediment.|$|E
5|$|Often, DVT {{begins in}} <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> of veins. The blood flow pattern in <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> can cause low oxygen {{concentrations}} in the blood (hypoxemia) of a valve sinus. Hypoxemia, which is worsened by venous stasis, activates pathways—ones that include hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1. Hypoxemia also results {{in the production of}} reactive oxygen species, which can activate these pathways, as well as nuclear factor-κB, which regulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 transcription. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1 contribute to monocyte association with endothelial proteins, such as P-selectin, prompting monocytes to release tissue factor-filled microvesicles, which presumably begin clotting after binding to the endothelial surface.|$|E
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> body {{is filled}} with water, the float moves upwards and closes <b>the</b> <b>valve.</b> If air {{collects}} in <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> body, <b>the</b> waterline lowers, as does the float, and <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> opens to release it. To give more sealing force on <b>the</b> <b>valve,</b> <b>the</b> float generally works <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> through a lever. A greater movement of the float gives a shorter, but more forceful, movement of <b>the</b> <b>valve.</b> This lever mechanism may be simply, almost crudely, made of a pressed steel strip which acts as a bending hinge.|$|R

5000|$|Each valve was a wood disc {{with leather}} facing on both sides. One face had a center hole {{leading to a}} pocket of a larger {{diameter}} in <b>the</b> wood. <b>The</b> <b>valve</b> was supported only by a lever between <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> plate pivot and the pouch lifter disc, with a right angle dowel extension that [...] "plugged in" [...] the center hole of <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> button. <b>The</b> pivotal lever is easily removable {{because it was not}} cemented to <b>the</b> <b>valve,</b> rendering a loose <b>valve</b> button in <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> well behind <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> plate that was screwed onto <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> chest with white sealing compound.|$|R
5|$|Venous {{insufficiency}} {{results when}} the vein dilates secondary to a vein wall disease or when normal functioning of <b>the</b> <b>valves,</b> which serve to keep blood flowing {{to the heart}} and to prevent reflux, become damaged and/or incompetent (the dilation of a vein will prevent valves to close properly). This incompetence will result in an reversed blood flow through the affected vein or veins. In varicose veins <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> are damaged, disfunction or missing and the insufficiency will be chronic. The reversed blood pools in the low third of legs and feet.|$|E
5|$|In all molluscs, {{the mantle}} forms a thin {{membrane}} {{that covers the}} animal's body and extends out from it in flaps or lobes. In bivalves, the mantle lobes secrete <b>the</b> <b>valves,</b> and the mantle crest secretes the whole hinge mechanism consisting of ligament, byssus threads (where present), and teeth.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{study of}} a {{hydraulic}} directional valve using a tridimensional fluid-dynamic approach will be shown.

5|$|Invertebrate predators include crabs, starfish and octopuses. Crabs {{crack the}} shells with their pincers and starfish use their water {{vascular}} system to force <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> apart and then insert {{part of their}} stomach between <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> to digest the bivalve's body. It has been found experimentally that both crabs and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by byssus threads to ones that are cemented to the substrate. This was probably because they could manipulate the shells and open them more easily when they could tackle them from different angles. Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by force, or they bore a hole into the shell and insert a digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents.|$|E
5|$|Manual {{squeezing}} {{and releasing}} – the examiner can compress the vein below the probe which will push {{the blood in}} its normal anterograde direction.

40|$|This paper investigates {{water hammer}} effects caused by closure of spherical <b>valves</b> against <b>the</b> discharge. During {{the first phase}} of {{modernisation}} of Perućica high-head hydropower plant (HPP), Montenegro, safety spherical valves(inlet turbine valves) have been refurbished on the first two Pelton turbine units. <b>The</b> <b>valve</b> closure is controlled by <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> actuator (hydraulic servomotor). Because the torque acting on <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> body is dependent on flow conditions <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> closing time may vary significantly fordifferent flow velocities (passive <b>valve).</b> For <b>the</b> passive <b>valve</b> <b>the</b> torques acting on <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> body should be considered in <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> model. <b>The</b> <b>valve</b> closing time results from numerical simulation. On the contrary, for <b>the</b> active <b>valve</b> <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> closing time is assumed prior to simulation. <b>The</b> spherical <b>valve</b> boundary condition is incorporated into the method of characteristics (MOC) algorithm. The staggered (diamond) grid in applying the MOC is used in this paper. <b>The</b> passive <b>valve</b> boundary condition is described by the water hammer equations, <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> equation that relates discharge to pressure head drop and the dynamic equation of <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> body motion (torque equation). <b>The</b> active <b>valve</b> boundary condition is described by the first two equations, respectively. Standard quasi-steady friction model is used for estimating friction losses in plants tunnel and penstocks. Numerical results using both the active and <b>the</b> passive spherical <b>valve</b> models are compared with results of measurements. It has been found that the influence of flow conditions on <b>the</b> spherical <b>valve</b> closing time is minor for the cases considered. Computed and measured results agree reasonably well...|$|R
5000|$|Not all {{of these}} valves have been removed and replaced. <b>The</b> risk of <b>valve</b> {{fracture}} has been balanced against {{the risk of the}} surgery to replace <b>the</b> <b>valve.</b> Decision tools have been published and are available from a trust set up for this purpose during the litigation surrounding <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> [...] "recall". <b>The</b> tools take into account patient age, the size and location of <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> (aortic or mitral) and other factors {{to come up with a}} recommendation as to whether surgery to replace <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> is worthwhile. In some patients the risk of surgery to replace <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> is higher than the risk of <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> fracturing.

50|$|The body is {{the main}} {{pressure}} containing structure of <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> and <b>the</b> most easily identified as it forms the mass of <b>the</b> <b>valve.</b> It contains all of <b>the</b> <b>valve's</b> internal parts that will {{come in contact with}} the substance being controlled by <b>the</b> <b>valve.</b> <b>The</b> bonnet is connected to the body and provides the containment of the fluid, gas, or slurry that is being controlled.|$|R
5|$|The {{shell is}} {{composed}} of two calcareous valves held together by a ligament. <b>The</b> <b>valves</b> are made of either calcite, {{as is the case}} in oysters, or both calcite and aragonite. Sometimes, the aragonite forms an inner, nacreous layer, {{as is the case in}} the order Pterioida. In other taxa, alternate layers of calcite and aragonite are laid down. The ligament and byssus, if calcified, are composed of aragonite. The outermost layer of the shell is the periostracum, a skin-like layer which {{is composed of}} a conchiolin. The periostracum is secreted in the groove between the outer and middle layers of the mantle, and is usually olive or brown in colour and easily abraded. The outer surface of <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> is often sculpted, with clams often having concentric striations, scallops having radial ribs and oysters a latticework of irregular markings.|$|E
5|$|The two valves of the bivalve shell {{are held}} {{together}} at the hinge by a ligament composed of two keratinised proteins, tensilium and resilium. In different groups of bivalves, the ligament may be internal or external in position. The main function of the ligament (as well as joining <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> together) is to passively cause the shell to open. The shell is actively closed using the adductor muscle or muscles which {{are attached to the}} inner surface of both valves. The position of the muscles is often clearly visible on the inside of empty valves as circular or oval muscle scars. Along the hinge line of the shell are, in most cases, a number of hinge teeth which prevent <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> from moving laterally relative to one another. The arrangement of these teeth is often important in identifying bivalves.|$|E
5|$|To {{control the}} engine's output, the MEC {{operates}} five hydraulically actuated propellant valves on each engine; the oxidizer preburner oxidizer, fuel preburner oxidizer, main oxidizer, main fuel, and chamber coolant valves.

40|$|DE 19836963 A UPAB: 20000419 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} {{applying a}} cyclic revolving bending load to <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> stem (1), which {{corresponds to a}} multiple of the bending loads of <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> stem that occur under normal conditions by <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> head rotation. A cyclic pressure threshold loading is applied to <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> head (3), which presses <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> head on <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> seat (4) and corresponds to a multiple of the fluid pressure acting on <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> head under normal conditions. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a device for implementing the method. USE - Inlet and outlet poppet valves for internal combustion engines. ADVANTAGE - Facilitates interference free testing of valves under load especially at critical points with high throughput for rational and quick mass testing of valves...|$|R

5|$|To {{control the}} {{movement}} of the hydrogen and air within the envelope, the Patrie was equipped with five valves, some of which operated automatically, and others which could also be operated manually by the pilot via cords. <b>The</b> <b>valves</b> on the gas-bag released hydrogen automatically when the pressure exceeded two inches of water (inAq) (500Pa, 0.723psi); whereas the ballonet valves opened when the air pressure exceeded 0.78inAq (195Pa, 0.282psi), thus ensuring that air was driven out of the ballonet before there was any loss of hydrogen from the gas-bag. The automatic operation of <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> was a factor in the duration of its final (unmanned) flight (see Final flight section below). The pressure in the ballonet was maintained by an engine-driven fan, for which an electrical back-up was provided so that the pressures could be maintained {{in the event of an}} engine failure or when the engine had to be switched off for maintenance purposes.|$|E
5|$|Also {{known as}} a {{manifold}} cage or regulator cage, this is a structure which can be clamped to {{the neck of the}} cylinder or manifolded cylinders to protect <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> and regulator first stages from impact and abrasion damage while in use and from rolling the valve closed by friction of the handwheel against an overhead. A valve cage is often made of stainless steel, and some designs can snag on obstructions.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{are filled}} by attaching a high-pressure gas {{supply to the}} cylinder valve, opening the valve and allowing gas to flow into the cylinder until the desired pressure is reached, then closing <b>the</b> <b>valves,</b> venting the connection and disconnecting it. This process involves a risk of the cylinder or the filling equipment failing under pressure, {{both of which are}} hazardous to the operator, so procedures to control these risks are generally followed.|$|E

5000|$|An in-line {{check valve}} is a check <b>valve</b> similar to <b>the</b> lift check <b>valve.</b> However, this valve {{generally}} has a spring that will 'lift' {{when there is}} pressure on the upstream side of <b>the</b> <b>valve.</b> <b>The</b> pressure needed on the upstream side of <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> to overcome <b>the</b> spring tension is called the 'cracking pressure'. When the pressure going through <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> goes below <b>the</b> cracking pressure, the spring will close <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> to prevent back-flow in the process.|$|R
50|$|Before {{internal}} inspection <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> must {{be removed}} after depressurising and verifying that <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> is open. Cylinders containing breathing gases do not need special precautions for discharge except that high oxygen fraction gases should not be released in an enclosed space because of the fire hazard. If <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> is blocked or stuck closed {{it may be necessary}} to release the pressure by removing the burst disc or drilling into <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> body below <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> seat. These operations require care to avoid injury.|$|R
5|$|Firefighters {{were again}} {{hampered}} {{when it was}} discovered the pressure relief valves on the standpipes were improperly adjusted when installed in the building. The Philadelphia Fire Department nozzles allowed 100 psi nozzle pressure while One Meridian Plaza's pressure relief valves were giving less than 60 psi discharge pressure, which was not sufficient to fight the fire. It was several hours into the fire before a technician who could adjust <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> arrived at the scene.|$|E
5|$|In most brachiopods, diverticula (hollow extensions) of {{the mantle}} {{penetrate}} through the mineralized layers of <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> into the periostraca. The function of these diverticula is uncertain {{and it is}} suggested that they may be storage chambers for chemicals such as glycogen, may secrete repellents to deter organisms that stick to the shell or may help in respiration. Experiments show that a brachiopod's oxygen consumption drops if petroleum jelly is smeared on the shell, clogging the diverticula.|$|E
5|$|The {{processes}} of feeding and capture may be aided by special parts; Pisaster brevispinus, the short-spined pisaster from the West Coast of America, {{can use a}} set of specialized tube feet to dig itself deep into the soft substrate to extract prey (usually clams). Grasping the shellfish, the starfish slowly pries open the prey's shell by wearing out its adductor muscle, and then inserts its everted stomach into the crack to digest the soft tissues. The gap between <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> need only be {{a fraction of a}} millimetre wide for the stomach to gain entry.|$|E
50|$|The air {{pressure}} in an inflated tire holds <b>the</b> inner <b>valve</b> body shut. A small screw and captive nut {{on the top}} of <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> body permits <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> to be screwed shut and ensure that it remains tightly closed. The nut must be unscrewed to permit airflow in either direction. This must be done before attaching a pump. The screw remains captive on <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> body even when unscrewed fully; it is tightened again after the tire is inflated and the pump removed. <b>The</b> <b>valve</b> cap protects <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> body, keeps dirt and mud out of the mechanism, and also prevents <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> from damaging <b>the</b> tube when it is rolled for storage, but is not necessary to prevent pressure loss.|$|R
50|$|Internally <b>the</b> fixed <b>valve</b> body is {{constructed}} as a cylinder, with the moving part of <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> within {{this as a}} piston. <b>The</b> conical <b>valve</b> {{is part of this}} piston. The piston is double-acting and splits <b>the</b> internal <b>valve</b> body in two, with water pressure on both sides. The upper side of the piston is larger, the full diameter of the piston, and is supplied with water through a throttling valve; normally adjusted and then left in position. The lower side of the piston is an annular space surrounding <b>the</b> moving <b>valve</b> body and maintained at the lower (Bernoulli) water pressure. The tip of <b>the</b> conical <b>valve</b> contains a small pilot <b>valve,</b> linking <b>the</b> upper chamber of <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> to <b>the</b> downstream drain below <b>the</b> <b>valve.</b> This pilot valve is controlled mechanically from outside <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> chamber and is the main control over <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> position.|$|R
40|$|A {{fast-acting}} valve {{includes an}} annular valve seat that defines an annular <b>valve</b> orifice between <b>the</b> edges of <b>the</b> annular <b>valve</b> seat, an annular valve plug sized to cover <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> orifice when <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> is closed, and a valve-plug holder for moving <b>the</b> annular <b>valve</b> plug {{on and off}} <b>the</b> annular <b>valve</b> seat. <b>The</b> use of an annular orifice reduces the characteristic distance between the edges of <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> seat. Rather than this distance being equal to {{the diameter of the}} orifice, as it is for a conventional circular orifice, the characteristic distance equals the distance between the inner and outer radii (for a circular annulus). The reduced characteristic distance greatly reduces the gap required between <b>the</b> annular <b>valve</b> plug and <b>the</b> annular <b>valve</b> seat for <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> to be fully open, thereby greatly reducing the required stroke and corresponding speed and acceleration of <b>the</b> annular <b>valve</b> plug. <b>The</b> use of a valve-plug holder that is under independent control to move <b>the</b> annular <b>valve</b> plug between its open and closed positions is important for achieving controllable fast operation of <b>the</b> <b>valve...</b>|$|R
