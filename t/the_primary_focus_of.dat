He was a professor of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado Boulder from 1990 until 2007. <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> his work is on the historical treatment of political dissenters and Native Americans by the United States government. His work features controversial and provocative views, written in a direct, often confrontational style.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, {{construction}} resumed on roadways throughout Ontario. The expressway between Highland Creek and Oshawa {{was completed}} in December 1947, while other sections languished. The Toronto–Barrie Highway was <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the Department of Highways at the time, and {{the onset of the}} Korean War in 1950 stalled construction again. Despite the delays, highway minister George Doucett officially announced the plans for construction of the new trans-provincial expressway that year, with the Toronto to Oshawa expressway serving {{as a model for the}} design. Work on the most important link, the Toronto Bypass, began in 1951, but it would not open with that name.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> {{the society}} {{at this time}} was simple subsistence. To {{continue}} as a group, they had to focus all of their energies on producing food. This was problematic {{because many of the}} members were becoming old and several suffered illnesses. Since the beginning, Beilhart and the other members had not actively sought out new members, believing that a small group was more viable. This proved to be their undoing as there were no younger members to sustain the farm. The original members, who had stayed with the group since its inception, began to leave and by 1928, only six were left. Financial strains forced them to relinquish the ranch and move to a house in the village of Soquel.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} half of the 20th century, due to a {{widespread}} distrust of permanent military forces in Australia, the reserve military forces were <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> Australian military planning. Following the end of World War II, however, this focus gradually shifted due to the changing strategic environment, and the requirement for a higher readiness force available to support collective security goals. Since then, Australian defence policy has been focused more upon the Regular Army, and there has been considerable debate about the role of the Army Reserve within defence planning circles. As the strategic situation has evolved in the post Cold War era, the organisation, structure, training and role of the Army Reserve has undergone considerable changes, and members of the Army Reserve are increasingly being used on overseas deployments, not only within Regular Army units, but also in units drawn almost entirely from Reserve units.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was also}} positively received; for example, Hendrix from GamePro shared his {{opinion that the}} game did well with management of the games time. Nelson and Hendrix from IGN and GamePro both emphasized their enjoyment of the games action elements. GameSpot, while feeling that the action elements were <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the game, still liked {{the wide variety of}} role-playing elements present. Nelson from IGN, however, wished that the role-playing elements had been reduced even further in favor of the action parts of the game. All three reviewers compared the game to The Legend of Zelda, such as Mielke from GameSpot who had discussed the game to release as a direct competitor to that series. Both GameSpot and IGN felt that the comparison was invalid, as Musashi focused much more on action than role-playing, resulting in a game that was not a direct competitor at all.|$|E

25|$|Legacy of Hopelessness showcased {{a bit of}} a {{departure}} for the band in that it had a lot more electronic influences. Keyboards are featured on nearly every track, and are sometimes <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>focus.</b> <b>Of</b> course, grindcore is still quite present as well as Mel's distinctive vocals. The change in musical style can probably be attributed to this being initially intended to be a solo release by Topon, but was migrated over to the band when it was realized that another full-length release was not quite feasible.|$|E
25|$|Consequentialism {{can also}} be contrasted with aretaic moral {{theories}} such as virtue ethics. Whereas consequentialist theories posit that consequences of action should be <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> our thinking about ethics, virtue ethics insists {{that it is the}} character rather than the consequences of actions that should be the focal point. Some virtue ethicists hold that consequentialist theories totally disregard the development and importance of moral character. For example, Philippa Foot argues that consequences in themselves have no ethical content, unless it has been provided by a virtue such as benevolence.|$|E

25|$|Research on {{myoclonus}} {{is supported}} through the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> research {{is on the}} role of neurotransmitters and receptors involved in the disease. Identifying whether or not abnormalities in these pathways cause myoclonus may help in efforts to develop drug treatments and diagnostic tests. Determining the extent that genetics play in these abnormalities may lead to potential treatments for their reversal, potentially correcting the loss of inhibition while enhancing mechanisms in the body that would compensate for their effects.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{to digital}} pianos or stage pianos, digital {{keyboards}} are usually much lower in cost, {{as they have}} unweighted keys. Like digital pianos, they usually feature on-board amplifiers and loudspeakers. Stage pianos, however, typically do not have integrated amplifiers and speakers, as these instruments are normally plugged into a keyboard amplifier in a professional concert setting. Unlike synthesizers, <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> home electronic keyboards is not on detailed control of sound synthesis parameters. Most home electronic keyboards offer little or no control or editing of the sounds (although a selection of 128 or more preset sounds is typically provided).|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> Giolittian {{politics}} was to rule {{from the center}} with slight and well controlled fluctuations, now in a conservative direction, then in a progressive one, trying to preserve the institutions and the existing social order. Critics from the right-wing considered him a socialist due to the courting of socialist votes in parliament in exchange for political favours, while critics from the left-wing, like Gaetano Salvemini, {{accused him of being}} a corrupt politician and of winning elections with the support of criminals. However his highly complex legacy continues to stimulate intense debate among writers and historians.|$|E
