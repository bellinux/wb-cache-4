5|$|In 1920, {{two years}} after Poland regained independence, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> was moved to Kraków, where from 1923 it was {{displayed}} {{in the building of}} the Polish Sejm. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> was hidden by the Polish resistance during World War II, when Poland was occupied by the Germans. After the war <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> was transferred to the National Museum in Warsaw, and occasionally displayed in the Sejm building. Since 1984 <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> has been {{in the collection of the}} Royal Castle in Warsaw, where Matejko himself declared he would like <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> to be shown. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> is displayed in the anteroom of the Chamber of Senators, where the Constitution was adopted. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> was restored in 2007.|$|E
5|$|When King bought <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> it {{consisted}} of 13 panels sewn together and rolled into one piece. To more easily store and transport <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> King unstitched the 13 panels and stored them individually together with two separate panels of scenery used to make <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> a bit longer depending on the exhibition space. The 13 panels along with the two extra scenery panels bring <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> to 410 feet long according to King. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> has, for the most part, remained rolled up since 1933, though it was donated by King to Wake Forest University upon his death in 1996. The university sold <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> in 2007 to an anonymous group of Raleigh, North Carolina, investors. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> has been appraised at a value of US$5.5 million, but {{the value of the}} sale remains unknown. The group intends to resell <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> to a new buyer who will commit to restoring the work and building a suitable structure to house it.|$|E
5|$|A Vision of the Last Judgement is a {{painting}} by William Blake that was designed in 1808 before becoming a lost artwork. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> was to be shown in an 1810 exhibition with a detailed analysis added to a second edition of his Descriptive Catalogue. This plan was dropped after the exhibition was cancelled, and <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> disappeared. Blake's notes for the Descriptive Catalogue describe {{various aspects of the}} work in a detailed manner, which allow the aspects of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> to be known. Additionally, earlier designs that reveal similar Blake depiction of the Last Judgement have survived, and these date back to an 1805 precursor design created for Robert Blair's The Grave. In addition to Blake's notes on <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> a letter written to Ozias Humphrey provides a description of the various images within an earlier design of the Last Judgement.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Phiale <b>Painter</b> became <b>the</b> Achilles Painter's most {{prominent}} student after he assumed the Berlin Painter's workshop. Almost {{a dozen other}} recognizable painters passed through the Achilles Painter's workshop as well. Notable painters include <b>the</b> Westreenen <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Persephone <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Clio <b>Painter,</b> Loeb <b>Painter,</b> and <b>the</b> Dwarf <b>Painter.</b> <b>The</b> Kleophon <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Sabouroff <b>Painter,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Munich 2335 all spent time at the workshop as well.|$|R

5|$|A book {{published}} by Nationalmuseum in 1992 on Carl Larsson {{claims that the}} most immediate and natural explanation for the ultimate rejection of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> {{was the fact that}} time had rendered <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> unfashionable. Because of the long debate, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> became a survivor from a time past and it could not meet the modernist ideals of the new century.|$|E
5|$|After Gilchriese {{closed his}} museum, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> and other {{contents}} of the museum were sold at auction by John's Western Gallery of San Francisco. The estimated auction price for <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> had been $200,000 to $300,000; the final sale price on June 25, 2004 was $40,250. It was put up for auction again on June 14, 2014 with an estimated selling price of $40,000–$60,000 but failed to sell.|$|E
5|$|After this rejection, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> {{was sold}} to a Swedish art {{collector}} who offered {{to sell it to}} the Museum of National Antiquities for 12 million Swedish kronor. This offer caused a controversy in which people debated if <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> belonged to Nationalmuseum or the Museum of National Antiquities. In this debate where there were exaggerations in both directions, people claimed that <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> was both an unsurpassed masterpiece of Swedish art and a work of suspect morality. In 1987, it was sold by Sotheby's in London to a Japanese art collector.|$|E
50|$|Several vase {{painters}} had specialised in <b>painting</b> Siana cups. <b>The</b> {{most important}} {{among them was}} <b>the</b> C <b>Painter.</b> Others include <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Athens 553, <b>the</b> Heidelberg <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Boston CA, <b>the</b> Kassandra <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Sandal <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Civico <b>Painter</b> and <b>the</b> Griffin-Bird <b>Painter.</b> At present, about 1,000 cups and fragments are known; a classification vital for their chronology and stylistic categorisation has been developed by Herman Brijder. A special type are so called Merrythought Cups, with a forked handle.|$|R
2500|$|Important {{painters}} of this period, roughly 480 to 425 BC, include <b>the</b> Providence <b>Painter,</b> Hermonax, and <b>the</b> Achilles <b>Painter,</b> all following <b>the</b> tradition of <b>the</b> Berlin <b>Painter.</b> <b>The</b> Phiale <b>Painter,</b> probably a pupil of <b>the</b> Achilles <b>Painter,</b> is also important. New workshop traditions also developed. Notable {{examples include the}} so-called [...] "mannerists", most famously among them <b>the</b> Pan <b>Painter.</b> Another tradition was begun by <b>the</b> Niobid <b>Painter</b> and continued by Polygnotos, <b>the</b> Kleophon <b>Painter,</b> and <b>the</b> Dinos <b>Painter.</b> <b>The</b> role of bowls decreased, although they were still produced in large numbers, e.g. by the workshop of <b>the</b> Penthesilea <b>Painter.</b>|$|R

5|$|Clarkson's {{book had}} an {{important}} influence on the artist J. M. W. Turner, who displayed a painting at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1840 entitled The Slave Ship. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> depicts a vessel from which a number of manacled slaves have been thrown into the sea, to be devoured by sharks. Some of the details in <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> such as the shackles worn by the slaves, {{appear to have been}} influenced by the illustrations in Clarkson's book. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> was shown at an important time in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide, as the Royal Academy exhibition opened one month before the first World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> was admired by its owner, John Ruskin. It has been described by the 20th-century critic Marcus Wood {{as one of the few}} truly great depictions in Western art of the Atlantic slave trade.|$|E
5|$|During 1983–1984, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> was {{exhibited}} at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm, and after this exhibit an art dealer offered to donate or sell <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> to Nationalmuseum. The board rejected the offer {{with the statement that}} the Old Norse motif was more appropriate for the Museum of National Antiquities, which at the time still shared the same building as Nationalmuseum. When the Museum of National Antiquities had been moved to a building of its own, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> should be moved there too.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Australian <b>painted</b> and <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> lady {{have very}} similar lifestyles and behaviours, but <b>the</b> Australian <b>painted</b> lady {{lives in an}} arid and {{stressful}} environment. Australian painted lady colouration could be induced in painted lady butterflies by injecting the larvae with stress-inducing hormones and subjecting them to lowered temperatures. This demonstrates the phenotypic plasticity, or the tendency for visible traits to vary with changing environmental conditions, of <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> lady butterflies. It also suggests that <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> lady is <b>the</b> ancestral form, and environmental stress slowly drove speciation by adaptation into <b>the</b> Australian <b>painted</b> lady. In other words, <b>the</b> Australian <b>painted</b> lady most likely evolved from <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> lady due to the environmental conditions in Australia.|$|R

5|$|Etty put a {{great deal}} of effort into <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> {{including}} visiting a mortuary to sketch the dead and decaying bodies on the Sirens' island. His use of real corpses became publicly known, causing complaints from some critics. Although he visited Brighton in 1836 to make studies of the sea in connection with <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> Etty had little experience of landscape and seascape painting, and <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> of the sea and clouds is rudimentary in comparison {{with the rest of the}} work.|$|E
5|$|Even Larsson's {{good friend}} and biographist Georg Nordensvan joined the critics, {{but he could not}} sway Larsson's {{determination}} either, although Larsson probably took his criticism hardest. The archaeologist Bror Schnittger, who was probably identical to the anonymous writer who had initiated the criticism, launched additional criticism in Svenska Dagbladet against the lack of historical authenticity in <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b> The distance in dating between the objects in <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> were given as at least 2000 years and Schnittger thought that <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> was unacceptable in the museum building. Larsson stated that he intentionally included objects that would be from the distant past in relation to the setting of <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> and that he did not see these as anachronisms, because he imagined the subjects would be antiquarians who kept ancient items as ritual objects.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{rejection}} by Coates, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> remained in Eakins' possession until his death. It was exhibited just twice more during Eakins' lifetime: at the 1886 Southern Exposition in Louisville, Kentucky, and in 1887 at Chicago's Inter-State Industrial Exposition, and ignored by critics on both occasions. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> then disappears from the historical record—there is no further reference to <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> in any records from Eakins or his {{circle of friends}} during Eakins' lifetime.

5|$|Hogarth {{exhibited}} <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> at the Society of Artists in Spring Gardens in 1761. Although {{press reports}} – perhaps placed by Hogarth {{and his supporters}} – were enthusiastic, Sigismunda mourning over the Heart of Guiscardo was attacked by critics who marked Hogarth's attempt to emulate the drama depicted in older Italian paintings as foolhardy and ridiculous. Many critics were repulsed by the shocking contrast between the melancholy beauty of Sigismunda and the grotesquely bloody organ that she delicately touched. It was said that Hogarth placed an attendant next to <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> to note the remarks made by the viewers; changes to <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> suggest {{that he may have}} responded to these criticisms by altering his work, although it is impossible to ascertain whether many of the changes were made before or after <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> was exhibited.|$|E
5|$|However, the two western towers left of {{the church}} display an unusual detail in <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b> The uniformly proportioned, large, square windows {{depicted}} there {{are associated with the}} Italian Renaissance, which was introduced in Sweden in 1572 during reconstruction of Kalmar Castle. While the construction works of Gustav Vasa are poorly documented, the presence of these windows in Stockholm in 1535 is unlikely. It seems more credible that this part of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> had been damaged before 1632, forcing the copyist to rely on another source. As the two square and crenellated towers in <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> are depicted much as they appear on a copperplate of Stockholm produced by Frantz Hogenberg around 1560–1570, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> thus probably renders this part of the castle as it appeared while the reconstruction was still under way, before its completion in the 1580s.|$|E
