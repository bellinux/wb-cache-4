She preferred French watercolor pigments that, alongside <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woodblocks, created embossed lines and striated patterns. Typically the woodblocks she created were made from cherry or basswood and she only pulled three or four prints from each woodblock. From 1916 to 1955, Lazzell created 138 woodblocks. Modern exhibitions of Lazzell's artworks have included the woodblocks themselves.|$|E
25|$|The deep {{canyons and}} sharp peaks of today's North Cascades scene are {{products}} of profound erosion. Running water has etched out <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> range, landslides have softened the abrupt edges, homegrown glaciers have scoured the peaks and high valleys and, during the Ice Age, the Cordilleran Ice Sheet overrode almost all the range and rearranged courses of streams. Erosion has written and still writes its own history in the mountains, {{but it has also}} revealed the complex mosaic of the bedrock.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} in northern Ireland gave Barkas {{the idea that}} every theatre of war is naturally patterned. When an army unit goes against <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pattern, he reasoned, it becomes conspicuous; to hide, {{it has to go}} with the pattern. He developed a simple illustration of this point, by dropping a collar stud on a carpet. When it fell on a plain area, it was easy to see; when in a patterned area, it had to be searched for.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet reforms greatly {{affected}} {{the life of}} the Doukhobors both in their old villages in Georgia and in the new settlement areas in the Russian South and Ukraine. The state anti-religious campaigns resulted in the suppression of Doukhobor religious tradition, and the loss of books and archival records. A number of religious leaders were arrested or exiled; for example, 18 people were exiled from Gorelovka alone in 1930. On the other hand, Communists' imposition of collective farming did not go against <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Doukhobor way of life. The industrious Doukhobors made their collective farms prosperous, often specializing in cheesemaking.|$|E
25|$|Woodcut is {{a relief}} {{printing}} artistic technique in printmaking {{in which an}} image is carved into {{the surface of a}} block of wood, with the printing parts remaining level with the surface while the non-printing parts are removed, typically with gouges. The areas to show 'white' are cut away with a knife or chisel, leaving the characters or image to show in 'black' at the original surface level. The block is cut along <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood (unlike wood engraving where the block is cut in the end-grain). In Europe beechwood was most commonly used; in Japan, a special type of cherry wood was popular.|$|E

25|$|Figure-work {{seems to}} have been universal. To carve a figure/design in wood may be not only more {{difficult}} but also less satisfactory than sculpting with marble, owing to the tendency of wood to crack, to be damaged by insects, or to suffer from changes in the atmosphere. The texture of the material, too, often proves challenging to the expression of features, especially in the classic type of youthful face. On the other hand, magnificent examples exist of the more rugged features of age: the beetling brows, the furrows and lines neutralizing the defects of <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood. In ancient work the surface may not have been of such consequence, for figures as a rule being painted for protection and especially color.|$|E
25|$|The 6th impression's blue-green is medium {{light and}} {{distinctly}} blue. The 7th impression's khaki binding, {{on the other}} hand, shows no hint of blue or green. Its color is considerably darker than the 10th through 12th impressions. The rust color of the 7th impression seems slightly darker than the 8th. Also, the 7th is lacquered whereas the 8th is not, which probably accounts for the color difference. The covers on the 10th through 12th impressions {{are very similar to}} each other, lighter than the 6th impression, and contain no distinctly blue cast. The 10th impression might be slightly lighter than the 12th, and the 12th might be slightly lighter than the 11th. However, not enough copies have been seen to be confident that the differences apply across each entire printing. The 14th impression is a heavily saturated grass green, distinctive and unmistakable. <b>The</b> <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cloth is finer and has been lacquered to smoothness.|$|E

Levin's contract guaranteed him absolute freedom to write whatever he chose, but Harmsworth, an unswerving Conservative, attempted to censor Levin's support for the other major party, Labour. Levin resigned, and immediately received offers from The Guardian and The Times to join them as a columnist. He found both tempting, {{and at one point}} [...] "even had a wild notion of suggesting that I should write for both simultaneously". In the end, he chose The Times, giving as his reason that though the liberal Guardian was more in line with his own politics than the conservative Times, [...] "I wrote more comfortably against <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper I worked for rather than with it". His obituarist in The Times adds that the decision may also have been swayed by the better remuneration offered by the paper.|$|E
500|$|One of four {{surviving}} Bruegel {{paintings in}} distemper, {{the work is}} a tüchlein, a type of light painting that uses tempera made from pigment mixed with water-soluble glue.

[...] It is not known from whom Bruegel learnt its use, but amongst those speculated are his mother-in-law, illuminator Mayken Verhulst; his teacher Pieter Coecke van Aelst; and painter and illuminator Giulio Clovio, with whom he resided in Italy and whom he helped paint miniatures in distemper. Due to the high perishability of linen cloth and the solubility of hide glue, tüchleins do not preserve well and are difficult to restore.

In an interview with VH1, photographer Charles Peterson commented that members from grunge band Tad “were given blue collar identities that weren’t entirely earned.
