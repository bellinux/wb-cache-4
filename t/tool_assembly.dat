40|$|AbstractSimulation and {{prediction}} of the machining {{process and the}} machined results of milling process is an important link in the control of milling quality. It is important on improving the machined surface quality, improving processing efficiency, and reducing processing errors. In the milling process, the assembly error of the cutting tool has great importance {{that should not be}} ignored for the forming of milled surface. Aiming at the problem of machining error in milling process caused by <b>tool</b> <b>assembly</b> error, this article investigated the milling process of peripheral milling, and researched the surface topography caused by the <b>tool</b> <b>assembly</b> error. Then the author established a simulation model to forecast the processing error caused by peripheral milling cutter assembly error. The model calculates the location of the tooth tipoff the milling tool by analyzing the knife tooth trajectory variation caused by the <b>tool</b> <b>assembly</b> error. Then discrete tracks of the teeth, to obtain the final processed surface by calculating the minimum value of all the teeth traces at discrete points. Through this model, we can get different surface morphology formed by different <b>tool</b> <b>assembly</b> errors to explore how the <b>tool</b> <b>assembly</b> error influences the processing quality. The study shows that when the cutter assembly errors exist, each tooth tip trajectory changes, making the surface topography phenomena that surface rises and falls, and cutting grooves’ size shrinks and expands. Cutting groove depth will change {{in the direction of the}} tool axis direction. The surface roughness will increase when the cutter assembly error increases, but the roughness does not change after increasing to a threshold value...|$|E

40|$|Metrology and Tooling are {{considered}} as discrete disciplines within Manufacturing Engineering, however, <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> often {{acts as a}} checking mechanism. <b>Assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> has the primary function of controlling part location during assembly; with a secondary requirement as a quality gate. In-tool checks are manual mechanical checks of the assembly, these gauging checks assume the tooling has the correct, nominal geometry. Tooling conformance is certified periodically; however these intervals can be up to three years. Further examination of the metrology requirements within the aerospace industry with respect to large scale <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> identify a requirement to: reduce manual metrology checks, reduce tooling recertification time, and enable greater automation. Currently, {{there is a lack}} of integration between metrology and Wing-box <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling.</b> This research investigates how to increase manufacturing confidence with respect to tooling conformance; and, ultimately improve the manufacturing process for aero-structures, through the increased and enhanced use of metrology in the <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> environment. The Metrology Enhanced Tooling for Aerospace (META) framework has been created to provide a robust framework for deploying metrology in the tooling environment. The major elements of the framework are subsequently detailed and demonstrated in three chapters: i) large volume metrology networks, for the measurement of tooling structures; testing instrument performance, quantifying and improving the uncertainty estimation, and ultimately, establishing a rapid measurement process for assembly tooling; ii) embedded metrology systems demonstrates how local measurement systems can be utilised to replace and improve on, traditional in-tool checks; and iii) metrology feedback presents an example of an automated tooling pick-up that manipulates the assembly to achieve the design intent. The contributions can be summarised as: firstly, the creation of the META framework for the deployment of metrology in <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> environment, accommodating and facilitating a number of the future <b>tooling</b> and <b>assembly</b> requirements. Secondly, the establishment of a generic commissioning methodology and measurement strategy for the rapid measurement of <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> to increase tooling confidence.

40|$|AbstractThermally induced errors on {{machine tools}} {{are one of}} the most {{important}} error sources in precision machining. Up to 75 % of the overall geometrical errors on workpieces are caused by thermal errors of the machine tool [1]. Thermo-elastic FE-analysis of larger machine tool structures results in complex models requiring a lot of computation time. Reducing the computation time is essential for design optimization as well as for control-integrated correction of thermal deformation. This work shows how a complex thermo-elastic FE model of a machine <b>tool</b> <b>assembly</b> can be reduced to a compact time-saving thermo-elastic calculation model. Application of the method introduced in this paper brings a computation time reduction by the order of 1 : 1000 with practically negligible loss of accuracy. This method will be verified on a frame assembly of a milling machine...|$|E
40|$|Metal cutting {{is today}} {{one of the}} leading forming {{processes}} in the manufacturing industry. The metal cutting industry houses several actors providing machine tools and cutting tools with a fierce competition as a consequence. Extensive efforts are made to improve the performance of both machine tools and cutting tools. Performance improvements are not solely restricted to produce stronger and more durable machine tools and cutting tools. They also include knowledge about how the machine tools and cutting tools should be used to perform at an optimum of their combined capacity. Information about the dynamic properties of the machine tool cutting <b>tool</b> <b>assembly</b> is one of the aspects that carries the most potential in terms of productivity increase and process reliability. This work presents a methodology to synthesise the dynamic behaviour of a machine tool and cutting <b>tool</b> <b>assembly</b> based on component models of the machine tool and the cutting tool. The system is treated as an assembly of subcomponents in order to reduce measurement effort. The target is to get the receptance {{at the tip of the}} machine tool/cutting tool which is a prerequisite for process analysis and optimisation. This methodology is compared with today's state-of-the-art methodology which require experimental testing for each cutting tool of interests mounted in the machine tool. Comparisons are also made with previous attempts to utilize component synthesis in this matter. The subcomponent approach presented here limits the experimental tests to the machine tool component. The machine tool component model is connected to a model representation, based on a finite element model of the cutting tool. The subcomponent models are obtained and coupled on state-space form, a technique that is new to the application of component synthesis of machine tool/cutting tool structures. Proposed procedures for measurements, system identification, enforcement of physical properties on state-space models and parameter influences on coupled results are presented, implemented and validated. This methodology opens windows not only to cutting process optimisation of an existing cutting tool but it also permits tailored cutting tool solutions for existing machining operations with fixed process parameters...|$|E
