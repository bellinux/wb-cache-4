5|$|During trials, {{the player}} cross-examines witnesses. They can move {{backwards}} and forwards through {{statements in the}} testimony, and can choose to press <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> {{for more information on}} a particular statement; sometimes, <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> will revise their testimony based on this. If the player spots a lie or a contradiction in the testimony, they can present evidence to demonstrate the contradiction. If the player presents incorrect evidence, the judge's confidence in the player will be lowered; if the judge's confidence in the player is depleted, the game ends.|$|E

5|$|The Suffer & <b>the</b> <b>Witness</b> was {{released}} on July 4, 2006. The album sold 48,327 copies in its first week of release in the United States, and peaked at number ten on the Billboard 200. The Sufferer & <b>the</b> <b>Witness</b> also charted in seven other countries, including number five on the Canadian Albums Chart, making it the band's first album to chart outside of the United States. It was certified gold in three countries, and platinum by Music Canada. The album was well received by critics, who praised the production value, and noted how Rise Against was able to mature in their sound and simultaneously retain their punk roots.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Witness</b> {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} on release. It currently holds an aggregated Metacritic score of 87/100 for Microsoft Windows based on 20 reviews, and 87/100 for PlayStation 4 based on 82 reviews.|$|E

5000|$|Jehovah's Witnesses' Office of Public Information has {{documented}} {{a number of}} mob attacks in India. It states that these instances of violence [...] "reveal the country's hostility toward its own citizens who are Christians." [...] There have been reports that police assist mob attacks on Jehovah's Witnesses or lay charges against <b>the</b> <b>Witnesses</b> while failing to charge other participants involved. In the city of Davangere on December 20, 2010 a mob confronted two female <b>Witnesses.</b> <b>The</b> mob broke into the home of one of <b>the</b> <b>Witnesses</b> where they had taken refuge. Property was damaged and one of <b>the</b> <b>Witnesses</b> was assaulted. When the police arrived, <b>the</b> <b>Witnesses</b> were {{arrested and charged with}} blasphemy.|$|R
5|$|A Nosek family {{representative}} {{said that}} based on <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> testimonies, the family {{did not believe that}} Blythe was solely responsible. He continued {{that he would not be}} substantiating the requested amount, as no money could replace the loss the family has suffered. He further added that Daniel had died on his father's birthday, and his mother has consequently become a psychiatry patient unable to work.|$|E
5|$|Blow {{created the}} Thekla, Inc. {{team for the}} {{development}} and publication of <b>The</b> <b>Witness.</b> Since December 2009, Blow was working remotely with two additional full-time roles, one a 3D artist, and another as a technical programmer. By 2015, Blow stated there were about eight full-time members on his team, though had had ten to eleven people involved around 2011, {{and as many as}} fifteen at its peak. <b>The</b> <b>Witness</b> incorporates other artists and programmer's contributions in smaller roles, such as David Hellman, who had previously worked with Blow on Braids art design and worked on conceptualizing the design of <b>The</b> <b>Witness.</b> Other contributors include Eric Urquhart, who has provided 3-D concept artwork for the game, and Ignacio Castaño, who has developed a rendering system for the game's illumination and visual effects. Blow gives much credit to Orsolya Spanyol, a freshly-graduated graphic artist he hired around 2011, for transforming the original sparse imagery of the island to the more vivid scenery that was included in the final game. By diversifying work on the game, Blow has been able to focus more of his time on the core game design, allowing his team to implement his vision, in contrast to the development of Braid where he also had to program much of the game himself.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1981, Ray Taylor {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} Jack Bridges in a fight in Chicago. In advance of the trial, the {{prosecutor}} submitted a request for all the defense witnesses in the case. The defense attorney for Taylor provided a list of four individuals, which did not include witnesses Alfred Wormley and Pam Berkhalter. When the defendant tried to introduce these witnesses {{on the second day of}} the trial, the trial judge sanctioned the defense for failing to put <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> names on the original list provided to the prosecution. Therefore, it ruled the two unlisted witnesses would not be allowed to testify. The trial judge was specifically frustrated that <b>the</b> <b>witness,</b> Wormley, was known to the defense prior to trial, but was hidden away from the prosecution.|$|E

5|$|Several {{other matters}} were also raised, {{relating}} to particular {{parts of the}} evidence (specifically, relating to <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> testimony of Yahya Goba, one of the Buffalo Six), but these matters had little bearing on the final outcome of the case, and were dealt with only briefly by the court. The central argument raised was that, with regard to all the circumstances, Thomas did not actually have a practical choice whether to speak or not.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Witness</b> {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics, who {{praised the}} difficult but surmountable puzzles and the game's art and setting.

5|$|Appeal to Reason is {{the fifth}} studio album by American punk rock band Rise Against. After touring in support of their {{previous}} album, The Sufferer & <b>the</b> <b>Witness,</b> Rise Against began recording Appeal to Reason in January 2008 at the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado. Recording and production were finished in June, and the album was released in North America on October 7, 2008. The album is the band's first release with guitarist Zach Blair. The album has been certified Gold by the RIAA and platinum by the CRIA.|$|E
5|$|Around 2012, {{development}} of <b>The</b> <b>Witness</b> for the next-generation of consoles with improved hardware capabilities became a possibility, and Blow {{and his team}} started looking at this opportunity. They had discounted the Wii U, again citing low specs, and decided {{to choose between the}} PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One platform. At the time of this decision, Sony was able to provide hardware information and development kits. Sony has also sought out independent developers like Blow to learn about the upcoming PlayStation 4 in preparation for its launch, while Microsoft had not yet released firm specifications for their console. Blow opted to go with the PlayStation platform; this decision was also aided by representatives from Sony that were interested in bringing the game to their system, and a larger trend of Sony to bring more downloadable and independently-developed games to their next console in contrast to Microsoft's tighter controls. Blow affirmed that there was no monetary deal involved with this decision. Blow also later acknowledged that he has had difficulties working with Microsoft in the past, and had previously explained several of the issues he had to go through with Microsoft to release his earlier game, Braid. <b>The</b> <b>Witness</b> had been planned as a launch-window title for the PlayStation 4 in 2013, a time-limited console exclusive. The Windows and iOS versions, at this point, were planned to be released alongside the PlayStation 4 version, barring any development delays that Blow and his team encountered. Other console versions would come later, if they opted to develop for them.|$|E

5|$|De la Rúa {{retired from}} {{political}} life after his resignation. The scandal over the labor flexibility law was renewed in 2003 when a former Senate worker, Mario Pontaquarto, {{claimed to be}} a witness of the case who delivered $5,000,000 to the legislators. De la Rúa was indicted alongside seven politicians from both the UCR and the PJ. In 2013, they were all cleared of charges by a unanimous resolution, and Pontaquarto was removed from <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> protection program.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh's {{career is}} not well {{documented}} in the surviving sources. Charters provide a little information about some of his activities, but overall their usefulness is limited; this is because no charter-collections (called cartularies) from the Gaelic south-west have survived the Middle Ages, and the only surviving charters relevant to Donnchadh's career come from the heavily Normanised English-speaking area to the east. Principally, the relevant charters record his acts of patronage towards religious houses, but incidental details mentioned {{in the body of}} these texts and <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> lists subscribed to them are useful for other matters.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Witness</b> is a 3D puzzle {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Thekla, Inc.

Inspired by Myst, the game involves the exploration of an open world island filled with natural and man-made structures. The player progresses by solving puzzles, {{which are based on}} interactions with mazes presented on panels around the island or hidden within the environment. The player will have to determine the rules of each puzzle from visual clues and audio recordings scattered around the island.|$|E
