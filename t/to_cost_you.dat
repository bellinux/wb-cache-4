6000|$|Waynefleet went out, and Gordon {{turned to}} Nasmyth. [...] "It's going <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> something," [...] he said. [...] "You can't charge {{it on the}} scheme. I'll divide it with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll admit it. The {{trouble is}} that these civilized comforts are apt <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> {{something}}. I mean one has usually to give up something else {{for the sake of}} them. You begin to understand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was no joke, as {{you will}} find <b>to</b> your <b>cost.</b> <b>You</b> fool, you would have it and you have got it. Who asked you to cross my path? If you had left me alone I would not have hurt you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then your {{kindness}} <b>to</b> Nellie well-nigh <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> your life," [...] Mrs. Dowsett said, laying {{her hand}} on his shoulder, while the tears stood in her eyes. [...] "And you never told us this before!" ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{freighter}} shrugged. [...] "Trying's going <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> something; you'll {{feel pretty}} {{mean when you}} meet the bill. Fools like you make me tired." [...] He beckoned the landlord. [...] "Get on a move; I want a drink." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's going <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you,</b> when you've {{paid for}} the claret, a matter of four dollars and fifty cents, this dinner," [...] she said, [...] "and I guess you'll {{have to give the}} waiter a quarter. Are you scared?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Devine, dryly, [...] "I {{guess you}} could. In this country they call any trail easy {{that you can}} crawl up {{on your hands and}} knees. Still, that little grading's going <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> about two {{thousand}} dollars a mile." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{it will be}} speedily, as {{you must}} learn <b>to</b> your <b>cost.</b> If <b>you</b> really want a mill on the Pascataqua, I will show you {{how it can be}} built at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, but {{you will}} have to know something, and know it <b>to</b> your <b>cost,</b> if <b>you</b> stay here. You don't know what a provoking, stupid, careless, unreasonable, childish, ungrateful set of wretches they are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{like a good}} job, but it's going <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> high if <b>you</b> mean to {{turn out}} a work of art," [...] he said. [...] "However, if Bethune thinks the notion all right, I suppose I'll have to consent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Stirling, [...] "it's going <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> just {{whatever}} I {{like to call}} it. I can swing {{every dollar}} that stock stands {{for up to two}} or three. Will you do me the favor to glance at that certificate?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Her {{uncle was}} sitting in the room at the time, and Ayala felt herself {{compelled}} to go to him and kiss him, and thank him for all his kindness. [...] "I am so sorry <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> so much money, Uncle Reginald," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must have}} me alive?" [...] he laughed grimly. [...] "Gadslife, but the honour is like <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> dear. Well, sirs?

6000|$|Strong began once or twice, {{as if to}} {{converse}} upon the subject, but the Major would not hear a word. He remarked on the moonlight on Apsley House, the weather, the cabstands--anything but that subject. He bowed stiffly to Strong, and clung to his nephew's arm, as he turned down St. James's Street, and again cautioned Pen to leave the affair alone. [...] "It had like <b>to</b> have <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> so much, sir, that you may take my advice," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it <b>to</b> my <b>cost.</b> Will <b>you</b> lend me your belief, dear friends? I {{arose from}} the table of La Belle Duchesse de------, the loser of a {{thousand}} sequins, and to this hour it seemeth but a moment that I was occupied." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never fear," [...] he cried, [...] "there {{is more to}} follow. <b>To</b> your <b>cost</b> shall <b>you</b> learn it. By God, sir! do {{you think}} that I am to suffer a Sicilian adventurer and a broken tavern ruffler to {{interfere}} with my designs?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Two {{horses and}} four bags of ore, and we're not through yet," [...] commented the freighter. [...] "Guess it's going <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} if you pack much pay-dirt out over Dead Pine trail. Anyway, you'll {{have to get}} that grading done before I come back here again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{your way}} you have been kind to me," [...] she admitted. [...] "Let me in return give you a word of advice. Let me beg you to have nothing {{whatever}} {{to do with my}} father, in friendship or in enmity. Either might be equally disastrous. Either, in the long run, is likely <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> dear." ...|$|E

[...] "What I am going <b>to</b> do may <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> a good deal of money, and my {{appointment}} to the Shasta is, of course, in your hands. I am going straight from here to Merril's house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place," [...] the station-master answered, [...] "a special train <b>to</b> London would <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> {{a hundred and}} eighty pounds, {{and in the second}} place, even if you were willing to pay that sum, it would be at least two hours before I could start you off. We could not {{possibly}} disorganize the whole of our fast traffic. The ordinary mail train leaves here at midnight with sleeping-cars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not; only I {{would not}} wish {{you to think}} that I would oppose you without some cause. If the man is in the wrong {{according}} to law let him be proved to be so. The <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> will be nothing. To him it might be of considerable importance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, what I'm {{going to}} say is in your interest, and you've got to believe that I have some {{authority}} for saying it. I can't tell you just how much, for I don't know as I know myself exactly. But I {{think you can get}} back if you work it right. Of course, you can't get back for nothing. It's going <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> something. It's going <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> all you've brought with you,"--Pinney watched Northwick's impassive face for the next change that should pass upon it; he caught it, and added--"and more. But I happen to know that the balance will be forthcoming when it's needed. I can't say how I know it, for I don't exactly know how I know it. But I do know it; and you know that it's for you to take the first step. You must say how much money you brought with you, and where it is, and how it can be got at. I should think," [...] said Pinney, with a drop in his earnestness, and as if the notion had just occurred to him, [...] "you would want to see that place of yours again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but he may}} be back by this train," [...] she cried, {{glancing at}} the clock, [...] "and I have a strange sort of fancy--I have had it all day--that Henry might come, too. It is overdue now. Any one might arrive here. Oh, please, for my sake, hurry away!" [...] she begged, the tears {{streaming}} from her eyes. [...] "If anything should happen, I could never forgive myself. It is because you have been so dear, so true and honourable, that all this time has been wasted.

6000|$|... "I {{will come}} with you," [...] Garcias said; [...] "but {{if you think that}} any talking of yours will persuade Nunez to move out of his way, you are mistaken. It is more likely <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> your own lives, I can tell you; however, I gave you the promise I would do my best for you when you started with me, and I will go with you now, though what you want to {{interfere}} for here is more than I can make out.

5000|$|Major General Quincy A. Gillmore {{ordered a}} {{provisional}} division assembled {{under the command}} of Brigadier General Edward E. Potter. Potter was ordered to destroy the railroads in the area between Florence, Sumter, and Camden. The importance of the mission was pointedly made by Sherman's statement that [...] "Those cars and locomotives should be destroyed if <b>to</b> do it <b>costs</b> <b>you</b> 500 men." [...] Potter took command of the provisional division on April 1, 1865, at Georgetown. The division numbered 2,700 men composed of two infantry brigades and auxiliary troops.|$|R
6000|$|Farewell, fair Armida, my joy and my grief, [...] In vain I {{have loved}} you, and hope no relief; [...] Undone by your virtue, too strict and severe, [...] Your eyes gave me love, and {{you gave me}} despair; [...] Now call'd by my honour, I seek with content [...] The fate which in pity you would not prevent: [...] To {{languish}} in love, were to find by delay [...] A death that's more welcome the speediest way.

6000|$|... "Now, my dear," [...] said Mrs. Holt, {{when they}} were seated before the fire after lunch, [...] "I {{want you to feel}} that you can come to me for everything. I must congratulate you and Howard on being {{sensible}} enough to start your married life simply, in the country. I shall never forget the little house in which Mr. Holt and I began, and how blissfully happy I was." [...] The good lady reached out and took Honora's hand in her own. [...] "Not that your deep feeling for your husband will ever change. But men are more difficult to manage as they grow older, my dear, and the best of them require a little managing for their own good. And increased establishments bring added cares and responsibilities. Now that I am here, I have formed a very fair notion of what it ought <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> to live in such a place. And I shall be glad to go over your housekeeping books with you, and tell you if you are being cheated as I dare say you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mysie {{suppressed}} her sobs, {{and with}} considerable difficulty muttered {{her desire to}} alight, and take her fortune by herself. Sir Piercie Shafton, too devoted a squire of dames to consider the most lowly as exempted from a respectful attention, independent of the claims which the Miller's maiden possessed over him, dismounted instantly from his horse, and received in his arms the poor girl, who still wept bitterly, and, when placed on the ground, seemed scarce able to support herself, or at least still clung, though, as it appeared, unconsciously, to the support he had afforded. He carried her to a weeping birch tree, which grew on the green-sward bank around which the road winded, and, placing her on the ground beneath it, exhorted her to compose herself. A strong touch of natural feeling struggled with, and half overcame, his acquired affectation, while he said, [...] "Credit me, most generous damsel, the service you have done to Piercie Shafton he would have deemed too dearly bought, had he foreseen it was <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> these tears and singults. Show me the cause of your grief, and if I can do aught to remove it, believe that the rights you have acquired over me will make your commands sacred as those of an empress. Speak, then, fair Molinara, and command him whom fortune hath rendered at once your debtor and your champion. What are your orders?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I am sorry, Wegg,' said Mr Boffin, in his clemency, 'that my {{old lady}} and I can't {{have a better}} opinion of you than the bad one {{we are forced to}} entertain.
