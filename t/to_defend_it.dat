The Treaty of Trodesillas {{at the beginning of}} Honoré's rule clarified Monaco's position as a protectorate of Spain, and thus later of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.

At 8:30a.m., the men of the 2nd Battalion of the 39th Infantry Regiment started their attack but found only an empty battery.

Unknown to the Japanese, the US Navy had divined the Japanese plan by breaking its JN-25 code and had prepared an ambush using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.|$|E

5|$|In December 1952, Kurosawa {{took his}} Ikiru screenwriters, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni, for a forty-five-day secluded {{residence}} at an inn {{to create the}} screenplay for his next movie, Seven Samurai. The ensemble work was Kurosawa's first proper samurai film, the genre for which he would become most famous. The simple story, about a poor farming village in Sengoku period Japan that hires a group of samurai <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>it</b> against an impending attack by bandits, was given a full epic treatment, with a huge cast (largely consisting of veterans of previous Kurosawa productions) and meticulously detailed action, stretching out to almost three-and-a-half hours of screen time.|$|E
5|$|In a 1649 treaty the Dutch had {{pledged to}} defend Denmark against unprovoked aggression, {{and from a}} Swedish point of view it was {{essential}} to establish naval supremacy in Øresund to keep the Dutch out should they decide {{to intervene in the}} conflict. Kronborg Castle sat near the narrowest part of Øresund, a sound only four kilometres wide, which gave the castle a supreme strategic importance. Frederick III had appointed the colonel Poul Beenfeldt commander of the castle and ordered him <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>it</b> at all costs. Should he fail in that, Kronborg was to be blown up to prevent the Swedes from using it.|$|E
5|$|It {{was clear}} from the onset that Stephen's reign in Serbia would be short-lived. The Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror {{considered}} Stephen's enthronement an unwarranted violation of his own rights, for the Ottomans too considered Serbia their vassal state. Mehmed promptly launched an attack on Smederevo in June, and there was no serious consideration of trying <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>it.</b> King Thomas rushed to his son's aid, trying to divert the Turks by laying siege to their fortress of Hodidjed, in the middle of Bosnia. Aware that Smederevo could not withstand Mehmed's attack, Stephen surrendered the fortress on 20 June. The Ottoman proceeded to annex the rest of the Serbian state to their empire within a year.|$|E

5|$|Odense {{is one of}} Denmark's oldest cities. Archaeological {{excavations}} in {{the vicinity}} show proof of settlement for over 4,000 years {{since at least the}} Stone Age. The earliest community was centred on the higher ground between the Odense River to the south and Naesbyhoved Lake (now dry) to the north. Nonnebakken, one of Denmark's former Viking ring fortresses, lay to the south of the river. Today, Odense's Møntergården Museum has many artefacts related to the early Viking history in the Odense area. The Vikings built numerous fortifications along the river banks <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>it</b> against invaders coming in from the coast.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January, several incidents, {{including}} a couple exchanges of gunfire, {{suggested that the}} embassy's security detail was insufficient to hold off armed Somalis until the USS Guam and USS Trenton arrived with their helicopters and soldiers, at that time scheduled to arrive on 7 January.

Ambassador Bishop made an urgent request to Washington for two platoons of soldiers to parachute into the embassy <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>it</b> until the ships arrived.

There were reports of mass killings and scores of civilian deaths. Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter received large quantities of arms and ammunition from depots captured elsewhere, enabling them to hold the line against JNA attacks.|$|E

5|$|The third British {{airborne}} mission planned was Operation Fustian, to {{be carried}} out by the 1st Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier Gerald Lathbury, and scheduled for the night of 13–14 July. The 1st Parachute Brigade's objective was the Primosole bridge, crossing the Simeto River, south of Catania. The bridge was a vital objective, as it was the only crossing point over the Simeto. Its capture would give the Eighth Army access to the Catania plain, to enable them to continue their advance northwards; its destruction would seriously hamper the advance. Once the parachute brigade had captured the bridge, they would then have <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>it</b> until relieved by units of the Eighth Army advancing from the landing beaches.|$|E

In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar Claudia Johnson describes as unsurpassed in its argumentative force, Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's justification of an equal society founded on the passivity of women.|$|E

Initial public outcry denounced the launching of the operation as the Soviet and Azerbaijani governments went on <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>it,</b> stating that the villagers of Shahumyan were providing aid and harboring the militias in their homes.

When the invasion became a reality in early 1942, Amir was one of the soldiers sent to Medan <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>it.</b> He and the other Dutch-allied forces were quickly captured by the Japanese.

Sigeberht refused, saying that he had renounced his worldly kingdom and now lived only for the heavenly kingdom. However, he was dragged from the monastery to the battlefield where, unwilling to bear arms, he went into battle carrying only a staff. The Mercians were victorious and Sigeberht, Ecgric and many of the East Angles were slain and their army was routed. In this way Sigeberht became a Christian martyr.
