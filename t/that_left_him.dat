5|$|After {{a strong}} {{performance}} by rookie quarterback Browning Nagle in the team's 5–0 1992 preseason, Coslet promoted {{him to the}} starting lineup. Despite throwing {{for a total of}} 366 yards against the Atlanta Falcons in the opener, then the second-highest yardage total for a quarterback making his NFL debut, the team lost 20–17; the Jets lost their first four games. Wide receiver Al Toon retired on November 27, 1992, having suffered the ninth concussion of his career earlier in the season. Two days later, defensive end Dennis Byrd collided with teammate Scott Mersereau when Chiefs quarterback Dave Krieg stepped forward in the pocket as the two players were about to sandwich him. Mersereau managed to walk away and continue his career with New York, but Byrd suffered a fracture to his C-5 vertebra <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> partially paralyzed. Inspired by Byrd's persistent high spirits, New York traveled to Buffalo the following week and defeated the AFC champion Bills. The Jets finished the season 4–12.|$|E
5|$|Fleury {{missed the}} first two months of the season before being reinstated. While out with {{teammates}} in January 2003, he was involved in a drunken brawl with bouncers at a strip club in Columbus, Ohio, <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> bloodied; he has no memory of the night and described it as among the lowest points of his life. He was not suspended, but the incident contributed to a collapse in the standings by the Blackhawks, and they placed him on waivers in March. No team claimed him, and Fleury finished the season with the Blackhawks, recording 12goals and 21assists in 54games. Following the season, in April 2003, he was suspended again by the league for violations of its substance abuse program. The suspension ended his NHL career.|$|E

5|$|Becca becomes hurt upon {{realising}} that Bradley and Stacey {{are getting}} married. While they are away {{at their own}} wedding, Becca steals a hairbrush with Archie's hair from The Queen Victoria, intending to have a DNA test done on Stacey's baby to prove if it is really Archie's. However, she has doubts and goes back with Stacey to return the brush, but is caught by Ronnie. Becca coerces Stacey to confess Archie raped her and the baby is his. However, Ronnie tells Stacey that Archie underwent an operation {{a few years back}} <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> infertile, meaning that Stacey's baby isn't his. Roxy accuses Ronnie of murdering Archie. Ronnie denies it, but tells her she found out about the rape, and that Archie once raped her. Peggy tells the two of them that when Archie was murdered, she found him lying on the floor, took her divorce papers from the bar and left him to die.

5|$|Having been {{promoted}} {{weeks after the}} end of the previous season and not being granted an increased wage budget, Smith felt he had a tough job in keeping Sunderland in the top flight in 1990–91. He allowed Gates and MacPhail to leave on free transfers in order to free up money to bring in new players. He spent £350,000 on Portsmouth defender Kevin Ball and took midfielder Peter Davenport from rivals Middlesbrough; Ball would prove to be a success, though Smith admitted in his autobiography that signing Davenport had been a mistake <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> unable to bring in any further players, as his small budget was spent. He was given further funds in February 1991 as Sunderland were engaged in a relegation battle, and Smith spent £225,000 on midfielder Brian Mooney, who had a limited impact due to injuries. On the final day of the season Sunderland had to better Luton Town's result at home to Derby in their match against Manchester City at Maine Road, but they lost 3–2 and were relegated back into the Second Division.|$|E
5|$|Hershey {{defeated}} the Springfield Falcons 3–2 in a shootout on November 2, in which Boyd Kane and Matt Pope scored their first regulation {{goals of the}} season, and Galiev made the game-winner in the seventh round of the shootout, his first professional shootout attempt. In a subsequent 3–2 loss against the Bridgeport Sound Tigers on November 5, the Bears allowed a season-high 11 power plays, four of which were five-on-three. Hershey had 50 total penalty minutes in the game, compared to 115 minutes total in their first eight games. Stoa suffered an upper body injury <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> scratched until January 5. The Bears went 3-for-7 on the power play during a 3–1 victory against the Penguins on November 9, ending a 0-for-18 power play stretch; Holtby made 38 saves in the game. The Bears lost their next match 2–1 against the St. John's IceCaps on November 10. They were outshot 27 to 19, making a total of 359 to 266 for the season and putting them 29th out of 30 {{in the league in}} shots.|$|E
