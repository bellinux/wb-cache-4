500|$|Jennings started {{reporting}} for ABC at its New York news bureau. At the time, ABC lagged behind the more established news divisions of NBC and CBS, {{and the network}} was trying to attract younger viewers. On February 1, 1965, ABC plucked the fresh-faced Canadian {{from the field and}} placed him at the anchor desk of Peter Jennings With the News, then a 15-minute nightly newscast. He replaced Ron Cochran, a fellow Canadian. At 26, Jennings was, and remains, the youngest-ever U.S. network news anchor. [...] "ABC was in bad shape at the time," [...] Jennings said. [...] "They were willing <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>anything,</b> and, to demonstrate the point, they tried me." ...|$|E
500|$|PopMatters {{named it}} the best album of 2010 in its year-end list. MTV and Entertainment Weekly placed it at number eight on their lists of the 20 Best Albums of 2010. The Guardian ranked the album number one on its list of 2010's top 40 albums, stating in {{conclusion}} [...] "No other album this year seems so alive with possibility. Monáe is young and fearless enough <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>anything,</b> gifted enough to pull {{almost all of it}} off, and large-hearted enough to make it feel like a communal experience: Us rather than Me". The ArchAndroid was voted the fourth-best album in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 2010. Five songs from the album were included in the poll's singles list, including [...] "Tightrope" [...] (number two), [...] "Cold War" [...] (number 22), [...] "Wondaland", [...] "Locked Inside", and [...] "Sir Greendown" [...] (all tied for number 549).|$|E
500|$|After {{the concert}} film was released, videos of the {{performances}} of three songs were released online. The performance of [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] from the DVD was previewed on Beyoncé's official YouTube page on November 25, 2013. A writer of Vibe magazine felt that the laser light show from the performance [...] "brighten up Atlantic City". The performance of [...] "Dance for You" [...] was also uploaded to the singer's channel two days later. The live rendition of [...] "Party" [...] was the final uploaded video from the concert film on December 2. John Walker of MTV reviewed it positively writing, [...] "The sparkling, goddess-like centerpiece in a swirling sea of pink feathers, Beyoncé shines like a true showgirl on stage. Thankfully, unlike the 1995 camp classic, none of her backup dancers look nefarious enough <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>anything</b> funny". Walker further praised Beyoncé's vocals and dance moves as [...] "on point as always" [...] and the [...] "flawlessly areolicious bustier" [...] she wore.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Eliza, it's all misery, misery, misery! My life is bitter as wormwood; {{the very}} life is burning out of me. I'm a poor, miserable, forlorn drudge; I shall only drag you down with me, that's all. What's {{the use of}} our <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> do <b>anything,</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> know <b>anything,</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> be <b>anything?</b> What's the use of living? I wish I was dead!" ...|$|R

50|$|I {{think my}} generation—myself, Jamie Thomas, Andrew Reynolds—we're the first street guys to ride these real big {{obstacles}} {{on a daily}} basis. It wasn't like we do it once for a video. I think we all group up skating like that. I think that's what sets us apart I suppose. The willingness <b>to</b> f—kin' <b>try</b> <b>anything</b> every day.|$|R
2500|$|Kurkjian's caller said Donati visited Ferrara at {{the federal}} lockup in Hartford, Connecticut, where he was being held, after his January 1990 arrest on {{racketeering}} charges. The two spoke quietly, using short and vague language, aware their conversations were likely being monitored. Donati told Ferrara he would get him out; Ferrara pleaded with him not <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>anything.</b> [...] "No matter what you do, it's {{not going to get}} me out of here", he said. [...] "They will for these; you'll see", Donati responded.|$|E
2500|$|Champion {{decided not}} <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>anything</b> new because he {{recognised}} {{the fact that}} audiences liked the nostalgia surrounding his act. On stage, his appearance did not change. He was {{the embodiment of the}} spirit of the poorer parts of London, wearing shabby, ill-fitting clothes, old work boots and a frayed top hat. One critic noted [...] "Like music hall itself, Harry Champion was of the people, he expressed the tastes of practically all his listeners, even those who would not openly admit it, and in World War 2 he sang to troops who found him a splendid tonic".|$|E
6000|$|... "If we {{are going}} <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>anything</b> like {{that we want to}} hurry," [...] {{returned}} Dick. [...] "He won't remain in this locality long--now he knows he is discovered." ...|$|E
5000|$|Wait for Me {{was mixed}} by Ken Thomas, who had {{previously}} produced some Sigur Rós albums. According to Moby,mixing the record with him Thomas was really nice, as he's creatively open <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>anything</b> (like recording an old broken bakelite radio and running it through some broken old effects pedals {{to see what it}} would sound like. It's on the record as a 45 second long track called [...] "Stock Radio"). And as a geeky technical aside, we mixed the record using purely analog equipment in true stereo, akin to how records were mixed in the late '60s, some of the songs sound pretty amazing in headphones, if I do say so myself...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Jack, that's all humbug! If {{you begin}} to lay {{everything}} to the credit of books, I'll quite lose my opinion of you," [...] cried Peterkin {{with a look of}} contempt. [...] "I've seen a lot o' fellows that were always poring over books, and when they came <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> do <b>anything,</b> they were no better than baboons!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'The general {{impression}} {{seemed to be}} that I should be foolish <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>anything</b> so speculative as beekeeping, so it fell through. Some very decent old boys got me another job.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “All right, sir! I {{am ready}} <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>anything</b> you may suggest, for I am sick {{to death of}} this work, and the heat, and the food, and the guard, and {{everything}} connected with it.” ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{was annoyed}} {{as well as}} touched by her warning, for it proclaimed {{that he was still}} far from looking the brave {{forester}} he felt himself to be. He replied: [...] "I'm not going <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>anything</b> wild, but I do intend to master the trailer's craft." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Here is my rowboat," [...] {{announced}} the farmer, pointing {{to where the}} craft was tied fast to a large tree. [...] "You can use {{it if you want}} to, but {{it looks to me like}} rather a hopeless matter <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> do <b>anything</b> while the river is raging like this. You had better wait until it calms down a little." ...|$|R
60|$|I confess this {{unexpected}} turn struck me dumb. I did not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> say <b>anything,</b> and Alderling went on.|$|R
6000|$|... "London," [...] growled Sparks, {{in a tone}} of sulky remonstrance, [...] "ain't a {{place for}} a man to git on in. If you've the luck to have friends who can help you, an' are willin', why it's well enough; but if you haven't got friends, its o' no manner o' use <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>anything,</b> except pocket-pickin' or house-breakin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite a mistake, Bob, {{founded in}} error or superstition. You have {{confused}} the will with the deed. I am indeed willing <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>anything,</b> but my {{capacity for action}} is limited, like my knowledge. In regard to the higher mathematics, for instance, I know nothing. Copper-mining I do not understand. I may say the same with reference to Tartar mythology, and as regards the management of infants under two years I am densely ignorant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And if they didn't burst, and we weren't shot by {{the next}} patrol, and if we'd {{calculated}} to be mean enough {{to run away from}} the women--where would we escape to?" [...] asked Banks curtly. [...] "Hold on at least until we get an ultimatum from that commodious ass at the Presidio! Then we'll anticipate the fool-killer, if you like. My opinion is, they aren't in any great hurry <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>ANYTHING</b> on us just yet." ...|$|E

6000|$|When he {{had first}} mooted this fire-alarm scheme of his, I had sat upon it, if you remember, with the maximum of promptitude and vigour. [...] "Rotten" [...] was the {{adjective}} I had employed to describe it, and you may recall that I mused a bit sadly, considering the idea conclusive proof of the general breakdown of a once fine mind. But now it somehow began {{to look as if}} it might have possibilities. The fact of the matter was that I had about reached the stage where I was prepared <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>anything</b> once, however goofy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Apropos of {{what you}} said about wearing harness," [...] Lydgate began, after they had sat down, [...] "I made up my mind some time ago to do with as little of it as possible. That was why I {{determined}} not <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>anything</b> in London, for a good many years at least. I didn't like what I saw when I was studying there--so much empty bigwiggism, and obstructive trickery. In the country, people have less pretension to knowledge, and are less of companions, but for that reason they affect one's amour-propre less: one makes less bad blood, and can follow one's own course more quietly." ...|$|E
60|$|My lucky {{day came}} after no tuna had been {{reported}} for a week. Captain Dan and I ran out off Silver Cañon just on a last forlorn hope. The sea was rippling white and blue, with a good breeze. No whales showed. We left Avalon about one o'clock, ran out five miles, and began to fish. Our methods had undergone some change. We used a big kite out on three hundred yards of line; we tied this line on my leader, and we tightened the drag on the reel so that it took a nine-pound pull to start the line off. This seemed a fatal procedure, but I was willing <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>anything.</b> My hope of getting a strike was exceedingly slim. Instead of a flying-fish for bait we used a good-sized smelt, and we used hooks big and strong and sharp as needles.|$|E
60|$|Merton {{then went}} to Mr. Macrae, and {{suggested}} that the boat should be sent across the sea ferry, <b>to</b> <b>try</b> if <b>anything</b> could be learned in the village. Mr. Macrae agreed, and himself went in the boat, which was presently unmoored, and pulled by two gillies across the loch, that ran like a river with the outgoing tide.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Bennett {{continued}} to run; but already {{he had begun}} to pant and falter, when he perceived looming upon his left the ruins of that ancient castle which had so attracted him on his first visit. On that occasion, it had made merely an aesthetic appeal to Mr. Bennett; now he saw in a flash that its practical merits also were of a sterling order. He swerved sharply, took the base of the edifice in his stride, clutched at a jutting stone, flung his foot at another, and, just as his pursuer arrived and sat panting below, pulled himself on to a ledge, where he sat with his feet hanging well out of reach. The bulldog Smith, gazed up at him expectantly. The game was a new one to Smith, but it seemed to have possibilities. He was a dog who was always perfectly willing <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>anything</b> once.|$|E
50|$|As on the Discovery Channel series MythBusters, {{this show}} {{practices}} {{a degree of}} self-censorship and safety-consciousness. Each episode begins with a staff member (usually Will) warning viewers not <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>anything</b> demonstrated on the show at home. In addition, during scenes of catastrophic failure, the crew will remind the audience not <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>anything</b> at home. The program also makes a noted point to avoid showing specific detail of how weapon modifications or fabrications are performed.|$|E
