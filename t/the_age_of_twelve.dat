By fourteen, Angel was performing throughout high school at restaurants in East Meadow, including the Wine Gallery. Angel's first major illusion was making his mother float in their family den. Early in his career he was helped by animal breeder and reality-television host Marc Morrone, who helped Angel find and train a set of doves for his act.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Great Awakening, {{the region}} was a hotbed of {{religious}} enthusiasm. Between 1817 and 1825, there were several camp meetings and revivals in the Palmyra area. Although Smith's parents disagreed about religion, the family {{was caught up in}} this excitement. Smith later said he became interested in religion by about <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>twelve.</b> As a teenager, he may have been sympathetic to Methodism. With other family members, Smith also engaged in religious folk magic, which was a relatively common practice in that time and place. Both his parents and his maternal grandfather reportedly had visions or dreams that they believed communicated messages from God. Smith said that, although he had become concerned about the welfare of his soul, he was confused by the claims of competing religious denominations.|$|E

5|$|Riefenstahl fell in {{love with}} the arts in her childhood. She began to paint and write poetry at the age of four. She was also athletic, and at <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>twelve</b> joined a {{gymnastics}} and swimming club. Her mother was confident her daughter would grow up to be successful in the field of art and therefore gave her full support, unlike Riefenstahl's father, who was not interested in his daughter's artistic inclinations. In 1918, when she was 16, Riefenstahl attended a presentation of Snow White which interested her deeply; it led her to want to be a dancer. Her father instead wanted to provide his daughter with an education that could lead to a more dignified occupation. His wife, however, continued to support her daughter's passion. Without her father's knowledge, she enrolled Riefenstahl in dance and ballet classes at the Grimm-Reiter Dance School in Berlin, where she quickly became a star pupil.|$|E

At <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>twelve,</b> Monteux organised and conducted a small orchestra of Conservatoire students to accompany Cortot in performances of concertos in and around Paris. He attended the world premiere of César Franck's Symphony in February 1889.

5|$|Dean Lyons {{was born}} on 20 April 1973; he was 24 when he was arrested. He grew up in Tallaght in West Dublin, the fourth {{in a family of}} six children. He went to Scoil Aonghusa National School in Tallaght, where he had some {{difficulty}} with his schoolwork. According to his teachers, in today's terms, he would have been classified as having a moderate general learning disability. He was assessed by a psychologist when he was in sixth class, around <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>twelve,</b> who found him to have an intelligence quotient of 70. As a result of the psychologist's report, Lyons was moved to St. Joseph's Special School in Tallaght. During his period in St. Joseph's, he developed a reputation for attention seeking and storytelling. After school, he never held down a steady job and drifted into heroin addiction and homelessness. At the time of his arrest for the Grangegorman murders, he had one conviction for burglary, and had been involved in a number of syringe robberies.|$|E
5|$|Philip Nel {{highlighted}} {{the influence of}} Jane Austen, whom Rowling has greatly admired since <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>twelve.</b> Both novelists encourage re-reading, because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the story-line– for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned {{near the beginning of}} Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry often has to re-examine his ideas near the ends of books. Some social behaviour in the Harry Potter books is remininiscent of Austen, for example the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors satirise social behaviour and give characters names that express their personalities. However in Nel's opinion Rowling's humour is more based on caricature and the names she invents are more like those found in Charles Dickens's stories, and Amanda Cockrell noted that many of these express their owners' traits through allusions that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature. Rowling, like the Narnia series' author C.S. Lewis, thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, Rowling combines literary genresfantasy, young adult fiction, boarding school stories, Bildungsroman and many others.|$|E
