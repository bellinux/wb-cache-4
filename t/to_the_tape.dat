5|$|The novel Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk was {{published}} in 1996. Before its publication, a 20th Century Fox book scout sent a galley proof of the novel to creative executive Kevin McCormick. The executive assigned a studio reader to review the proof {{as a candidate for}} a film adaptation, but the reader discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producers Lawrence Bender and Art Linson, who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine the script's length, and an initial reading lasted six hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running time, and they used the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording to Laura Ziskin, head of the division Fox 2000, who listened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> and purchased the rights to Fight Club from Palahniuk for $10,000.|$|E

25|$|A common {{application}} of a torque motor would be the supply- and take-up reel motors in a tape drive. In this application, driven from a low voltage, the characteristics of these motors allow a relatively constant light tension to be applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> {{whether or not the}} capstan is feeding tape past the tape heads. Driven from a higher voltage, (and so delivering a higher torque), the torque motors can also achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without requiring any additional mechanics such as gears or clutches. In the computer gaming world, torque motors are used in force feedback steering wheels.|$|E

Next up for Powell was the IAAF Diamond League Meeting in Birmingham, England on 10 July. He became the first man in history to break the 10 seconds barrier in the Sir Alexander Stadium when he clocked a very easy looking 9.95s in his heat. Later, in the final he eased to a 9.91s victory where compatriots Nesta Carter and Michael Frater finished second and third respectively. Powell was satisfied with both his races, stating that he took both the races easy due to very chilly and rainy conditions. Asafa seemed more and more confident heading into the World Championships in late August. Powell next competed on 30 July in Budapest at the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Shelby suggests that as Will had been with Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) since he was fifteen and has immediately moved on to a new relationship, he ought to take some time out for himself. She later observes as New Directions' star singer, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), and Vocal Adrenaline's Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff) kiss, and exchanges knowing looks with Jesse.

500|$|Following {{their work}} on the vocal guide, Jackson and Jones began {{thinking}} of alternatives for the line [...] "There's a chance we're taking, we're taking our own lives": the pair was concerned that {{the latter part of}} the line would be considered a reference to suicide. As the group listened to a playback of the chorus, Richie declared that the last part of the line should be changed to [...] "We're 'saving' our own lives", which his fellow musicians agreed with. Producer Jones also suggested altering the former part of the line. [...] "One thing we don't want to do, especially with this group, is look like we're patting ourselves on the back. So it's really, 'There's a choice we're making.'" [...] Around 1:30am, the four musicians ended the night by finishing a chorus of melodic vocalizations, including the sound [...] "sha-lum sha-lin-gay". Jones told the group that they were not to add anything else <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> [...] "If we get too good, someone's gonna start playing it on the radio," [...] he announced.|$|E

Mottola left the event later that evening, and got into his limousine and listened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> He quickly realized that he had found a talented vocalist, turned the car around and returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. After a week of tracking her down through Starr's management, Mottola got in touch with Carey and invited her to go to Columbia Records. After meeting with Carey and her mother Patricia for the first time, Mottola said, [...] "When I heard and saw Mariah, there was absolutely no doubt that she was in every way destined for super-stardom." [...] After a few brief meetings, Carey was signed to Columbia in December 1988.|$|E

50|$|Some tapes may {{deteriorate}} {{because of}} a breakdown in the binder (the glue) that holds the oxide particles on <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> or <b>the</b> back coating on the reverse side, if <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> was from any of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> manufacturers who had inadvertently used an unstable binder formulation. That binder contained polyurethane that soaks up water and causes <b>the</b> urethane <b>to</b> rise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape's</b> surface. This problem {{became known as the}} 'sticky-shed syndrome'. One explanation was offered that short strands of urethane were most commonly used in tapes - until it was discovered that middle-sized strands are better and were good at absorbing moisture. Baking <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> temporarily restores <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> by driving <b>the</b> water molecules from the binder {{so that it can be}} safely copied to another tape or a different format.

500|$|Brady {{admitted}} under police questioning {{that he and}} Evans had fought, but {{insisted that}} he and Smith had murdered Evans between them; Hindley, he said, had [...] "only done {{what she had been}} told". Smith told police that Brady had asked him to return anything incriminating, such as [...] "dodgy books", which Brady then packed into suitcases. Smith had no idea what else the suitcases contained or where they might be, but he mentioned in passing that Brady [...] "had a thing about railway stations". The police consequently requested a search of all Manchester's left-luggage offices for any suitcases belonging to Brady, and on 15 October British Transport Police found {{what they were looking for}} at Manchester Central railway station—the left-luggage ticket was found several days later in the back of Hindley's prayer book. Inside one of the suitcases were nine pornographic photographs taken of a young girl, naked and with a scarf tied across her mouth, and a 13-minute tape recording of her screaming and pleading for help.

500|$|By {{the end of}} March 2011, {{the band}} {{returned}} to finish the record at 5150 with engineer Ross Hogarth. Most of the work at 5150 was for guitars and bass, as Eddie [...] "couldn't hear them at Henson the way I'm used to." [...] Both he and Hogarth felt that attempts at mixing there were not progressing due to sound quality issues. Eddie attributed this <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> machines at Henson, claiming that: [...] "Everything ended up sounding like it had a sock over it." [...] The final mix took place {{over a period of}} six weeks in the summer of 2011, with each song taking a day to mix. Hogarth indicated that because the process was done at a mixing console, [...] "We couldn't {{move on to the next}} song until a mix had been approved by everyone and could go off the desk." [...] Hogarth would start with the drums, adding bass and guitar to finish a backing track, which would be complemented with multing (hiving off different sections of a given part to different tracks) and parallel compression. It was then finished by bringing in Roth's vocals, backing vocals, and further details such as ad libs, screams and guitar solos.|$|E
500|$|The {{rights to}} Buddha and its {{associated}} recordings were {{the subject of a}} legal dispute between the band and Secor in later years. According to Secor, he and the band had a gentleman's agreement: he would pay for the costs of recording and manufacturing the tape, and in exchange would receive half of all the profits from it. Raynor contends that the oral agreement was that Secor would invest $1,000 and when that money was recouped, the band would have complete ownership of the work product. Secor helped the band sign to Cargo Music in 1994, as he had connections at the label; he felt that by helping the briskly growing band sign a deal he could build his own label, Filter, in the wake of Blink's success. According to Secor, he attempted to contact the band to discuss the rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> but would only receive comments such as [...] "Oh, let me call my manager and I'll call you right back." [...] Secor asserted he should have the rights to the master tapes, as he financed the entire production. Cargo Music began calling and making threats, and Secor had no money to fight back with, as they had no written contract. In 1996, the band signed a joint-venture deal with major label MCA Records, who also began making calls to Secor. [...] "Try going up against that," [...] Secor remarked in 2001.|$|E
