5|$|Just {{before the}} Japanese {{surrender}} {{that ended the}} war, News-Miner editor David Tewkesbury died. He was replaced by Art Bremer, a reporter. The post-war boom caused a sudden shortage of newsprint, as paper mills {{were not able to}} meet the demand {{of a growing number of}} newspapers nationwide. This shortage caused the News-Miner to run short until Lathrop used his industrial connections to divert a shipment from a newspaper <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> out of business.|$|E
5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he would try and tell us it was out of his hands, and go back on his word. If it was out of the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E
5|$|During the {{artillery}} barrage {{that preceded the}} infantry assault, Longstreet began to agonize over an assault <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to cost dearly. He attempted to pass the responsibility for launching Pickett's division to his artillery chief, Col. Edward Porter Alexander. When {{the time came to}} actually order Pickett forward, Longstreet could only nod in assent, unable to verbalize the order. The assault, known as Pickett's Charge, suffered the heavy casualties that Longstreet anticipated. It was the decisive point in the Confederate loss at Gettysburg and Lee ordered a retreat back to Virginia the following day.|$|E

5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing.

5|$|Taylor {{was named}} to the Aussie Belles <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to the 2012 Summer Paralympics. That the team {{qualified}} for the Games came as a surprise, as the Australian Paralympic Committee had been working on player development with an idea of the team qualifying for the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and an Australian team had not participated since the 2000 Summer Paralympics, when they earned an automatic selection as hosts, and the team finished last in the competition. Going into the Paralympics, her team was ranked eighth in the world. The Australian Paralympic Committee had chosen to work on her development as a goalball player with the idea that {{she might be able to}} qualify for and win a medal at the 2016 Summer Paralympics. Taylor debuted the national team's Paralympic uniform on 1 May 2012 at the Sydney Overseas Passenger Terminal on day two of the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia Spring/Summer 2012/13. In the 2012 Summer Paralympics tournament, the Belles played games against Japan, Canada, the United States and Sweden. They lost every game, and did not advance to the finals.|$|E

5|$|Susan was {{diagnosed}} with Multiple sclerosis in 2007. Two years prior, MS Australia pitched a storyline to the Neighbours team asking for a character to be diagnosed with MS and for them to then show the impact MS can have on a community. The society contacted a producer and discussed a possible storyline for a young character in her twenties who had a promising career and family ahead of her. In 2006, the society {{received a phone call}} from one of the writers who revealed that they had chosen to write an MS story into the show and they had selected Susan Kennedy to be the character <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be diagnosed. The society was initially disappointed, as Susan was older than the typical person diagnosed with the condition. However, they were pleased that a permanent character and not an extra was chosen. MS Australia attended a meeting with the Neighbours writers to help develop a realistic and true portrayal of the diagnosis, symptoms and treatments. On-screen Susan was seen displaying unusual symptoms, including black outs and loss of sight and sensation in her hands. She was then seen undergoing an MRI scan, before she {{was diagnosed}} with multiple sclerosis.|$|E
