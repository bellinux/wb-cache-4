5|$|Scholar Andrew Spicer {{argues that}} British film noir evidences a greater debt to French poetic realism {{than to the}} expressionistic American mode of noir. Examples of British noir from the classic period include Brighton Rock (1947), {{directed}} by John Boulting; <b>They</b> <b>Made</b> <b>Me</b> a Fugitive (1947), directed by Alberto Cavalcanti; The Small Back Room (1948), directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger; The October Man (1950), directed by Roy Ward Baker; and Cast a Dark Shadow (1955), directed by Lewis Gilbert. Terence Fisher directed several low-budget thrillers in a noir mode for Hammer Film Productions, including The Last Page (a.k.a. Man Bait; 1952), Stolen Face (1952), and Murder by Proxy (a.k.a. Blackout; 1954). Before leaving for France, Jules Dassin had been obliged by political pressure to shoot his last English-language film of the classic noir period in Great Britain: Night and the City (1950). Though it was conceived in the United States and was not only directed by an American but also stars two American actors—Richard Widmark and Gene Tierney—it is technically a UK production, financed by 20th Century-Fox's British subsidiary. The most famous of classic British noirs is director Carol Reed's The Third Man (1949), from a screenplay by Graham Greene. Set in Vienna immediately after World War II, it also stars two American actors, Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles, who had appeared together in Citizen Kane.|$|E
25|$|It is now {{seventeen}} years since I came to serve these princes with the Enterprise of the Indies. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> pass {{eight of them}} in discussion, {{and at the end}} rejected it as a thing of jest. Nevertheless I persisted therein... Over there I have placed under their sovereignty more land than there is in Africa and Europe, and more than 1,700 islands... In seven years I, by the divine will, made that conquest. At a time when I was entitled to expect rewards and retirement, I was incontinently arrested and sent home loaded with chains... The accusation was brought out of malice on the basis of charges made by civilians who had revolted and wished to take possession on the land...|$|E

25|$|After many false starts, he {{was finally}} cast in a supporting, yet crucial role as a tragic young {{composer}} in a Michael Curtiz film titled Four Daughters. After the picture's release in 1938, he received wide critical acclaim and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The studio quickly revised Garfield's contract—designating him a star player rather than a featured one—for seven years without options. They also created a name-above-the-title vehicle for him titled <b>They</b> <b>Made</b> <b>Me</b> a Criminal. Before the breakout success of Daughters, Garfield had made a B movie feature called Blackwell's Island. Not wanting their new star to appear in a low-budget film, Warners ordered an A movie upgrade by adding $100,000 to its budget and recalling director Michael Curtiz to shoot newly scripted scenes.|$|E
500|$|Reid {{started his}} career with the Nottingham Forest youth academy, after joining from Cherry Orchard. Reid said [...] "I chose Forest years ago because <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel wanted, because they had more time for me as a young kid than I felt at Arsenal or United". He turned {{professional}} in August 1999, making made his debut on 29 November 2000 against Sheffield United. In the 2001–02 season Reid failed to score a goal, although he played in 31 games.|$|E
500|$|A new freshman, David Banks, wrote {{a letter}} to his mother about his {{experience}} in trying out for the football team in the fall of 1901:"I am not sure whether I ought to play football or not. ... I put on Tom's suit one night and went down to the field to meet Yost and a few other men. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> run around the track a couple times to try my wind. Then they rolled me around the ground and sat on me a while. I did not understand the necessity of all they did to me, but the boys say every great player must begin that way." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh no; I {{have seen}} {{men who had}} done even more, men who had made not only wash-tubs, but soap--strong-smelling yellow soap, in great bars; and <b>they</b> never <b>made</b> <b>me</b> the least uncomfortable." ...|$|R

500|$|Dan Stapleton for IGN {{described}} it as [...] "a barely serviceable, paint-by-numbers third-person shooter". He wrote that both playable characters were too similar, the combat was [...] "completely generic" [...] and that errors in the animation looked clumsy with [...] "objects clipping through each other; crazy, badly lip-synced dialog (not that syncing it with this corny writing would fix it); and general screwups make Star Trek play like a blooper reel." [...] Stapleton was surprised that the game continued to be playable, as he noted that several scripted events during the game failed to start as scheduled. He also felt that the mini-games throughout the game were [...] "so mind-numbingly simple and repetitive and/or frustrating <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> eager {{to get back to}} just being bored." [...] He said that the game seemed unfinished, and gave it an overall score of 4.2 out of ten. Edge magazine said that the game [...] "more bugs crawling on it than a Fear Factor contestant", and mentioned issues such as the characters running through walls, enemies becoming immortal and camera angles showing the inside of Kirk or Spock's skull. Star Trek was otherwise described as bland, even running through to the achievements with boring titles and the co-op system [...] "succumbs to awkward banter and gimmicky co-op puzzles".|$|E
500|$|Lavigne's {{feature film}} debut was voicing an {{animated}} {{character in the}} 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, [...] "All the actors went in individually, and [...] Tim and [...] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with {{no one else to}} kind of feed off of." [...] Lavigne found the recording process to be [...] "easy" [...] and [...] "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. [...] "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." [...] Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. [...] " [...] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude". The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336million worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{swear it}} {{happened}} just like that. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> {{go into a}} room, I pissed into some bottles and they closed them without sealing them.

2500|$|A month later, Layton {{received}} a package containing [...] "an entire issue of pencils on the Champions", {{and discovered that}} he was [...] "the new regular inker on the book." [...] He worked for Marvel [...] "for about a year, then signed an exclusive one-year contract with DC — after <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> 'an offer I couldn't refuse'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] he answered. [...] "I {{have tried}} other things, {{and you know}} what <b>they</b> <b>made</b> of <b>me.</b> If I live here till I am as old as Naudheim, I shall only be {{suffering}} a just penance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Too well! Too well! <b>They</b> <b>made</b> even <b>ME</b> {{forget my}} pride, and, by the Broken Lock that freed me, I went singing through the Jungle as though I were out wooing in the spring! Didst thou not hear us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With drawn swords <b>they</b> <b>made</b> for <b>me,</b> {{but before}} I went down beneath them they had tasted {{of the steel}} of my father's sword, and I had given such an account of myself as I know would have pleased my sire had he lived to witness it." ...|$|R
2500|$|After L.A. Confidential, Curtis Hanson {{was working}} on a {{screenplay}} of his own and reading other scripts with a keen interest for his next film. Actress Elizabeth McGovern advised Hanson to work with screenwriter Steve Kloves. When he was given the writer's script for Wonder Boys and was told that Michael Douglas was interested in starring, he [...] "fell in love with these characters – and <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> laugh". Hanson also identified with Grady Tripp and the [...] "thing building up inside him: frustration, hunger, yearning, et cetera".|$|E
2500|$|Madame de Maintenon asked Louise {{if she had}} fully {{considered}} the discomforts that awaited her at the Carmelite convent which ended up including being forbidden to wear the shoes that allowed her to walk without a limp. [...] "When I shall be suffering at the convent", Louise replied, [...] "I shall only have to remember what <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> suffer here, and all the pain shall seem light to me." [...] The day she left, she threw herself {{at the feet of}} the Queen, begging forgiveness: [...] "My crimes were public, my repentance must be public, too." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yes, but I don't like it. I {{have to do}} it, but I don't like it at {{all because}} I don't like the kind of voice I have. I really hate {{listening}} to myself! The first time I listened to a recording of my singing was when we were recording San Giovanni Battista by Stradella in a church in Perugia in 1949. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> listen to the tape and I cried my eyes out. I wanted to stop everything, to give up singing... Also now even though I don't like my voice, I've become able to accept it and to be detached and objective about it so I can say, [...] "Oh, that was really well sung," [...] or [...] "It was nearly perfect." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at night, when I sleep very soundly, except {{after that}} poor cabman was killed.

5|$|More than anything, <b>they</b> just <b>made</b> <b>me</b> laugh. I couldn't believe I'd {{walked into}} this situation. You didn't {{care if they}} were in time with the dance steps or whether one was {{overweight}} or one wasn't as good as the others. It was something more. It just made you feel happy. Like great pop records.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Green. Yes, <b>they</b> have <b>made</b> <b>me</b> President of the County Horticultural Society. My {{speech was}} quite a success; it was punctuated with applause.

2500|$|Along with Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Mudhoney, and Nirvana, Screaming Trees {{were part}} of Seattle's {{emerging}} grunge scene in the early 1990s. The band was formed in late 1984 by Mark Lanegan, guitarist Gary Lee Conner, bassist Van Conner and Mark Pickerel. Mark Pickerel would later be replaced with Barrett Martin. Lanegan said [...] "I was such a shitty drummer that <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> sing." [...] The band released the Other Worlds EP in 1985 (originally available only in a cassette format, the album was re-released on CD and LP by SST Records in 1987). Though the band was being courted by major labels, in 1985 they signed to Velvetone records to release their debut album, Clairvoyance. Musically the album {{is a combination of}} psychedelic music and hard rock, while it bears many similarities to early grunge.|$|E
2500|$|His {{increased}} profile led {{to contact}} with other individuals, including musicians such as Elton John. John {{at that time was}} trying to assist British performers whom he personally liked to achieve success in the US (he had released records in the US by veteran British pop singer Cliff Richard on his own Rocket label). John tried to give Connolly a boost in America by using him as the opening act on his 1976 US tour. But the well-intentioned gesture was a failure. John's American fans had no interest in being warmed-up by an unknown comedic performer– especially a Scotsman whose accent they found incomprehensible. [...] "In Washington, some guy threw a pipe and it hit me right between my eyes", he told Michael Parkinson two years later. [...] "It wasn't my audience. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel about as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, EastEnders {{scriptwriter}} Tony Jordan revealed {{how it was}} {{his idea}} to bring Den back in 2003. Jordan had started working at EastEnders in 1989, after Den had already left the series. Jordan {{had always wanted to}} write material for Den and Angie and so he campaigned for the return of Den for many years. He told the Daily Mirror, [...] "At story conferences I'd say, 'How do we know he's dead? They never found a body'. Eventually, just to shut me up, <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> write an episode where Den's body was found and identified by his ring." [...] Jordan finally got his way in 2003; however, according to the writer, Leslie Grantham's internet sex scandal spelled the demise of the character. Commenting on this, Jordan said, [...] "If [...] hadn't come out I think it would have worked and he'd still be in the show. When I saw him on screen after those revelations came out, suddenly I couldn't believe in the character any more. I was starting to love the character and buying into all of it, but after that I saw him as Leslie Grantham - not Den Watts. He was older, and flawed in all the wrong ways. I think a lot of viewers felt the same, and the cast as well, probably." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{go back to}} the {{prosecution}} and I tell them that I was pressured to recognize myself as a victim and that now nobody wanted to represent me, that I had no psychologist and was in a house without heating. <b>They</b> destroyed <b>me,</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> recognize something that I never wanted to recognize, and when I recognize it, it turns out that I do not have the rights.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Never,' he {{answered}} readily; then recalling himself--'not at the set times I mean, though <b>they</b> often <b>made</b> <b>me</b> think the comfort I had there mere hypocrisy and delusion, and be nearly {{ready to give}} over what depended on myself.
