40|$|It’s almost cliché to {{say that}} Blanche is a living figure of division. The basic {{dichotomy}} between her lofty aspirations and debasing bodily drives finds its expression in heavily polarized spaces and bodily movements, as well as verbal sparring scenes and actual physical duels in both film and play. In Elia Kazan’s adaptation of Tennessee Williams’s 1947 play however, shots and camera angles seem to particularly frame Blanche’s character as a highly vulnerable creature. She’s often shown in high angle shots and close-ups revealing {{the wear and tear}} of the various masks she puts on. Blanche is also often filmed in <b>two-shots,</b> with someone else looking down on her, and these <b>two-shots</b> very much resemble disturbing pas de deux between an eager female and an unreliable male.

25|$|A unique {{example is}} the Soviet S4M pistol, {{designed}} to be used expressly {{for the purpose of}} assassination. It was a simple break-open, <b>two-shot</b> derringer, but the unique features came from its specialized ammunition, designed around a cut-down version of the 7.62mm rounds used in the Soviet AK-47. The casings of the round contained a piston-like plunger between the bullet and the powder that would move forward inside the casing when fired. The piston would push the round down the barrel and plug the end of the casing, completely sealing off any explosive gases in the casing. This, combined with the inherently low-velocity round resulted in a truly silent pistol. The nature of the gun and ammunition led to it being wildly inaccurate outside of point-blank range. To add further confusion and throw possible suspicion away from the assassin, the barrel rifling was designed to affect the bullet {{in such a way that}} ballistics experts would not only conclude that the round was fired from an AK-47, but that the round was fired from several hundred feet away. Due to the politically devastating nature inherent in this design, the S4M was kept highly secret. Information on the pistol was not known by western governments until well after the end of the Cold War.|$|E

50|$|Being Remington's first gas-operated shotgun, the Model 58 {{suffered}} from many design shortcomings {{compared to the}} contemporary Model 11-48 with which it shared many design features and parts. The gas system was built into {{the front of the}} magazine and therefore limited capacity to <b>two-shots.</b> Gas was tapped from a hole in the barrel into a large chamber. A piston in this chamber drove an action bar rearward which, in turn, operated the bolt to cycle the action. The action spring was also located inside the forward end of the magazine tube.|$|R
500|$|<b>Two-shot</b> or {{multi-shot}} moulds {{are designed}} to [...] "overmould" [...] within a single moulding cycle and must be processed on specialised injection moulding machines with two or more injection units. This process is actually an injection moulding process performed twice and therefore has a much smaller margin of error. In the first step, the base colour material is moulded into a basic shape, which contains spaces for the second shot. Then the second material, a different colour, is injection-moulded into those spaces. Pushbuttons and keys, for instance, made by this process have markings that cannot wear off, and remain legible with heavy use.|$|E

So, for the first electronic keyboards, the key legends were produced by <b>two-shot</b> (or double-shot, or two-color) molding, where either the key shell or the inside of the key with the key legend was molded first, and then the other color molded second. But, to save cost, other methods were explored, such as sublimation printing and laser engraving, both methods which could be used to print a whole keyboard at the same time.|$|E

2500|$|At this stage, {{the teams}} were being manned {{according}} to the planned missions' objectives from their base at [...] "Whiskey-3". Some 120 to 200 Commandos were available for duty at a given moment, and their missions were usually shallow incursions from Military Region 3 into North Vietnam.

Developed for the Commando Raiders in 1969, the <b>two-shot</b> 2.75 inch rocket launcher was modified from the rocket pod on O-1F Bird Dog spotter aircraft.

40|$|The goal of {{comparison}} is {{to reveal the}} difference of compared objects as fast and reliably as possible. In this paper we formulate and investigate the unambiguous comparison of unknown quantum measurements represented by non-degenerate sharp POVMs. We distinguish between measurement devices with apriori labeled and unlabeled outcomes. In both cases we can unambiguously conclude only that the measurements are different. For the labeled case it is sufficient to use each unknown measurement only once and the average conditional success probability decreases with the Hilbert space dimension as 1 /d. If the outcomes of the apparatuses are not labeled, then the problem is more complicated. We analyze the case of two-dimensional Hilbert space. In this case single shot comparison is impossible and each measurement device must be used (at least) twice. The optimal test state in the <b>two-shots</b> scenario gives the average conditional success probability 3 / 4. Interestingly, the optimal experiment detects unambiguously the difference with nonvanishing probability for any pair of observables. Comment: 10 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper I {{formulate}} a framework that accommodates many unambiguous discrimination problems. I show that the prior information about any type of constituent (state, channel, or observable) allows us to reformulate the discrimination among finite number of alternatives as the discrimination among finite number of average constituents. Using this framework I solve several unambiguous tasks. I present a solution to optimal unambiguous comparison of two ensembles of unknown quantum states. I consider two cases: 1) The two unknown states are arbitrary pure states of qudits. 2) Alternatively, they are coherent states of single-mode optical fields. For this case I propose simple and optimal experimental setup composed of beam-splitters and a photodetector. As a second tasks I consider an unambiguous identification (UI) of coherent states. In this task identical quantum systems are prepared in coherent states and labeled as unknown and reference states, respectively. The promise is that one reference state {{is the same as}} the unknown state and the task is to find out unambiguously which one it is. The particular choice of the reference states is unknown to us, and only the probability distribution describing this choice is known. In a general case when multiple copies of unknown and reference states are available I propose a scheme consisting of beamsplitters and photodetectors that is optimal within linear optics. UI can be considered as a search in a quantum database, whose elements are the reference states and the query is represented by the unknown state. This perspective motivated me to show that reference states can be recovered after the measurement and might be used (with reduced success rate) in subsequent UI. Moreover, I analyze the influence of noise in preparation of coherent states on the performance of the proposed setup. Another problem I address is the unambiguous comparison of a pair of unknown qudit unitary channels. I characterize all solutions and identify the optimal ones. I prove that in optimal experiments for comparison of unitary channels the entanglement is necessary. The last task I studied is the unambiguous comparison of unknown non-degenerate projective measurements. I distinguish between measurement devices with apriori labeled and unlabeled outcomes. In both cases only the difference of the measurements can be concluded unambiguously. For the labeled case I derive the optimal strategy if each unknown measurement is used only once. However, if the apparatuses are not labeled, then each measurement device must be used (at least) twice. In particular, for qubit measurement apparatuses with unlabeled outcomes I derive the optimal test state in the <b>two-shots</b> scenario. Comment: 141 pages, based on PhD thesi...|$|R
