Louis Vauxcelles in Gil Blas attacked them with a violence <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> extraordinary. Younger critics who wrote columns in Comoedia, Excelsior, Action, and L'Oeuvre were more reserved, some of them even welcomed the Cubists with sympathy; in Paris-Journal, the free spirited poet André Salmon wrote an account of Room 41 that was full of intelligence and sympathy. The most important thing for Gleizes was that the younger generation of critics had been won over by Cubism.|$|E

25|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} {{for the emergence of}} both a native British identity and the appearance of a Germanic culture in Britain in the 5th and 6th centuries must consider first the period at the end of Roman rule. The collapse of Roman material culture some time in the early 5th century left a gap in the archaeological record <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> rapidly filled by the intrusive Anglo-Saxon material culture, while the native culture became archaeologically close to invisible—although recent hoards and metal-detector finds show that coin use and imports did not stop abruptly at AD 410.|$|E
25|$|Kuvempu {{was more}} than a writer for his life was in itself a 'great message'. He was against casteism, {{meaningless}} practices and religious ritual. Kuvempu's writings reflect his resentment against these practices. The Shoodra Tapaswi ("untouchable saint") was one such writing. Kuvempu who was from the Vokkaliga community gave a perspective to the ancient epic Ramayana <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> unlike the portrayal of the characters by the original author Valmiki. Kuvempu's version of the epic called Sri Ramayana Darshanam won him the prestigious Jnanpith Award. His epic underscores his vision of Sarvodaya ("upliftment of all"). The protogonist of his epic, the Hindu god Rama, personifies this when he tests himself along with his consort Sita by jumping into the fire.|$|E

25|$|During 1969, Buckley {{began to}} write and record {{material}} for three different albums: Lorca, Blue Afternoon, and Starsailor. Inspired by the singing of avant-garde musician Cathy Berberian, he decided to integrate the ideas of composers such as Luciano Berio and Iannis Xenakis in an avant-garde rock genre. He started to fully use his vocal range. According to Underwood, Buckley knew that Lorca had little to no chance in the commercial market. Selecting eight songs that {{had yet to be}} recorded, these tracks evolved into the sessions for Blue Afternoon, an album <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> similar to Happy Sad in style. In a 1977 article for Down Beat magazine, Underwood wrote that Buckley's heart was not into the Blue Afternoon performances and that the album was a perfunctory response to please his business partners.|$|E
25|$|One major {{hallmark}} of McNamara's cost reductions was {{the consolidation of}} programs from different services, most visibly in aircraft acquisition, believing that the redundancy created waste and unnecessary spending. McNamara directed the Air Force to adopt the Navy's F-4 Phantom and A-7 Corsair combat aircraft, a consolidation <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> successful. Conversely, his actions in mandating a premature across-the-board adoption of the untested M16 rifle proved catastrophic when the weapons began to fail in combat. McNamara tried to extend his success by merging development programs as well, resulting in the TFX dual service F-111 project. It was to combine Navy requirements for an Fleet Air Defense (FAD) aircraft and Air Force requirements for a tactical bomber. His experience {{in the corporate world}} led him to believe that adopting a single type for different missions and service would save money. He insisted on the General Dynamics entry over the DOD's preference for Boeing because of commonality issues. Though heralded as a fighter that could do everything (fast supersonic dash, slow carrier and short airfield landings, tactical strike, and even close air support), in the end it involved too many compromises to succeed at any of them. The Navy version was drastically overweight and difficult to land, and eventually canceled after a Grumman study showed it was incapable of matching the abilities of the newly revealed Soviet MiG-23 and MiG-25 aircraft. The F-111 would eventually find its niche as a tactical bomber and electronic warfare aircraft with the Air Force.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{structural}} restrictions {{imposed on}} American banks under the Glass–Steagall Act and other regulations in the 1930s, {{there was no}} private merchant banking industry in the United States, a situation <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> exceptional in developed nations. [...] As late as the 1980s, Lester Thurow, a noted economist, decried {{the inability of the}} financial regulation framework in the United States to support merchant banks. US investment banks were confined primarily to advisory businesses, handling mergers and acquisitions transactions and placements of equity and debt securities. [...] Investment banks would later enter the space, however long after independent firms had become well established.|$|E
500|$|The costume {{designer}} created all of Hathaway's outfits from scratch, and [...] "looked for {{images of a}} young Jane Austen." [...] Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh explained, [...] "I wanted to get her youthfulness and innocence across through her dress. But crucially there was also her strength of character. So we kept away from frills and flounces. I wanted a definite look <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> strong but also pretty at the same time. Jane was living on a working farm so her dress had to be practical as well. In terms of the costume we were definitely trying to steer away from the chocolate box image that we associate with Jane Austen." ...|$|E
500|$|Three years later, [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was {{included}} as the fifth {{song on the}} Neo-Punk segment of Madonna's 2001 Drowned World Tour, where she performed it wearing punk inspired clothing, while the backdrop screens showed an extended version of the song's music video. This time, the electric guitar was played by Monte Pittman. Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH noted that [...] "things quickly hotted up with [...] 'Ray Of Light', a track <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> simply as sublime as it was infectious". In 2005, Madonna performed [...] "Ray of Light" [...] during the Live 8 benefit concert, {{and a year later}} at the 2006 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California. During her 2006 Confessions Tour, Madonna included a rock version of [...] "Ray of Light" [...] as the second song of the show's third act, the Glam-Punk segment. For this performance the singer played the electric guitar and urged the audience to jump-along. She was accompanied by six male backup dancers, dressed in black outfits and white ties doing a synchronized choreography. Rolling Stone called the performance [...] "hard-rocking".|$|E

500|$|For this record, Björk {{incorporated}} shelved songs {{she wrote}} in Manchester with 808 State's Graham Massey, which had preceded the recording sessions for Debut. These included [...] "Army of Me" [...] and [...] "The Modern Things", which had become live staples over the summer, and thus {{did not need to}} undergo extensive transformations at Compass Point. Massey stated: [...] "With [...] "Army of Me" [...] we wanted to try something <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> hard and techno-y. I'm not sure how she wrote those lyrics so fast but I remember that song being almost instantaneous. [...] We kind of knocked that off in one day and then started on [...] "The Modern Things" [...] the same day and finished that the next". Although the album was supposed to be delivered the day after she returned from the Bahamas, Björk felt it was not yet complete and decided to continue its production back in London. She enlisted a new team of engineers and programmers, and spent the next months [...] "tweaking, rearranging, and sometimes completely rerecording her pre-existing tracks". Ultimately, it was the inclusion of more [...] "real" [...] instruments that [...] "resuscitated Post for Björk".|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{elected to}} play less {{well-known}} {{songs on the}} tour and avoided some of his bigger hits. He was eager to not repeat the formula that made the Serious Moonlight Tour a success, saying, [...] "It seemed so easy. It was cheers from the word go. You {{know how to get}} a reaction – play 'Changes,' 'Golden Years' and they'd be up on their feet. You get the reaction, take the money and run away. It seemed too easy. I didn't want to do that again." [...] In a different contemporary interview he said, [...] "I'm not doing 'Star' again. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> hard. I don't think I'm doing much Ziggy material on this tour! [...] Probably use a lot of that mid-70s material, but not the more ponderous things like 'Warszawa.' I tried that, and that was a bit yawn-making. There was one I was humming to myself the other day: [...] 'Baby, baby, I'll never let you down' – oh lord, what's that one? Jesus, I can't remember it. ... 'Sons of the Silent Age!' [...] Ah! That's right! Thank god I could remember it! So that for me now is a new song. I've never done that one onstage." [...] "Sons of the Silent Age" [...] was performed every night of the tour.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{struggled to}} cast Jessie Bannon. Peter Lawrence ultimately chose Jesse Douglas, who he felt reflected Jessie's energy and intelligence—" [...] has immense energy, huge energy, {{and is the}} kind of woman who could do all the kind of things Jessie could do—you know, athletic, smart, so and so forth [...]" [...] Douglas impressed Lawrence with her active lifestyle, including ballet, equestrianism, and tennis. When asked about the character's inclusion, Douglas stated, [...] "I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. It is not like she is a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she is a really good springboard {{for the rest of the}} storyline." [...] Roth supported her, claiming that [...] "Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with... I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend." [...] H-B Chief Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults [...] "there might be a Tracy/Hepburn thing going on." [...] Turner approached George Segal to audition for the part of Dr. Quest. Segal described the show as having [...] "a real family feeling about it...

But I spent a total of 15 years—if you count the first year I played her on Dallas. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> an investment for me as an actress. If you were playing a goody-two-shoes today, the tabloid media would be dying to catch you on a bad day. [...] Look at what they’ve done to Tiger Woods. Look at what they’ve done to that man. My feeling is his father—or the absence of his father in his life—is (the root of) what’s going on with Tiger and that marriage. But the media won’t leave him alone. No matter who you are, (the celebrity coverage) is obsessive and constant. It’s hurtful. For me, if they show my face in a bad photo, they latch into me hook, line and sinker. Even Entertainment Tonight now has blood on their hands. It's brutal. I wonder what they’ll do with Alec Baldwin now. He was my brother on Knots.

500|$|In {{order to}} develop Whitney's sexual abuse storyline, by March 2008 EastEnders {{researchers}} Libby Duplock and Cleo Bicat were {{in contact with the}} NSPCC's Tom Narducci, Jude Toasland, who deals with abused children, and Yvonne Traynor, CEO of the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre. Duplock has stated that: [...] "One thing <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> difficult for me to get right was the idea that she didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony happy. If she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough." [...] Narducci for the NSPCC stated that importance was placed on making children viewing the show [...] "feel comfortable about asking for help if they felt they needed it [...] for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them know that they can do something about it. [...] We're not trying to cause a national panic. This is a responsible effort to try to get over an important story." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} {{originally planned}} {{to add a}} feature that would allow players to craft weapons, but the idea was ultimately discarded. According to Hope, [...] "We thought about what people {{would want to do}} in order to survive. We explored different ideas, and one of them was fashioning weapons to defend yourself. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> early on, but then we realised that this game isn't really about pulling the trigger." [...] Another cancelled feature was the alien's iconic acid blood as a game mechanic, which could melt through metal like in the film. Although the feature was implemented at one point, it was eventually removed from the game because the developers felt it would change the course of the game in a [...] "weird" [...] direction. In addition, the developers considered the possibility for the game to be played from a third-person perspective, but then realised that it would significantly change the experience. Hope explained that it would become [...] "a game about jockeying the camera and looking after your avatar. But in first-person it's you that's being hunted. If you're hiding behind an object and you want to get a better view of your surroundings, you have to move." [...] The actual development of the game took overall four years to complete after the Creative Assembly first pitched the idea to Sega. The game went gold on 9 September 2014 and is dedicated to Simon Franco, a programmer of the game, who died during its development.|$|E
