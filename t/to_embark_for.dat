5|$|In January, 1815, the 1/52nd {{departed}} Portsmouth for Cork, {{where they}} were due <b>to</b> <b>embark</b> <b>for</b> America, where fighting in the War of 1812 continued. Gales prevented sailing, {{and by the time}} conditions had improved, news had arrived of Napoleon's escape from Elba. The 1/52nd were sent to Belgium, {{at the start of the}} Hundred Days. Napoleon marched swiftly through France to meet the Allies, who had formed two armies, with the Duke of Wellington commanding the Anglo-Allies, and Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher commanding the Prussians.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, Bennett volunteered to serve with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and, after securing his release from AMP on full pay, was appointed second-in-command of the 6th Battalion, {{which was part of}} the 2nd (Victorian) Infantry Brigade, assigned to the 1st Division. After a short period of training, the 1st Division began <b>to</b> <b>embark</b> <b>for</b> Europe. Just prior to his departure overseas, Bennett became engaged to Bess Buchanan, who he had met at a dance in Canterbury. As an engagement gift, Bess bought her betrothed a miniature photo of herself, set in a gold frame. Bennett carried the picture in his jacket pocket while serving overseas and it later saved his life on the Western Front, deflecting a German bullet.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, Napoleon {{tried to}} force Louis XVIII to renounce his right to the throne of France, but Louis refused. In May 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte {{declared}} himself Emperor of the French. Louis XVIII and his nephew departed for Sweden in July for a Bourbon family conference, where Louis XVIII, the comte d'Artois, and the duc d'Angoulême issued a statement condemning Napoleon's decision to declare himself emperor. The King of Prussia issued a proclamation saying that Louis XVIII {{would have to leave}} Prussian territory, which meant leaving Warsaw. Alexander I of Russia invited Louis XVIII to resume residence in Jelgava. Louis XVIII had to live under less generous conditions than those enjoyed under Paul I, and he intended <b>to</b> <b>embark</b> <b>for</b> England as soon as possible.|$|E

5|$|The 5th Light Infantry {{had arrived}} in Singapore from Madras in October 1914. They {{had been sent to}} replace the Yorkshire Light Infantry, which had been ordered to France. The 5th Light Infantry {{consisted}} of roughly equal numbers of Punjabi Muslims and Pathans serving in separate companies. Their morale was constantly low, being affected by poor communication, slack discipline and a weak leadership. The regiment had been employed to guard the captured crew from the German ship, SMS Emden and reportedly attempts were made to fan the discontent amongst the sepoys. The regiment was under orders <b>to</b> <b>embark</b> <b>for</b> further garrison duty in Hong Kong, however rumours started {{that they were going to}} be sent to fight in the Middle East against fellow Muslims from the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Amidst the {{backdrop}} of the Battle of Britain, while stationed on Salisbury Plain the battalion carried out garrison duties and undertook training to enable them to rapidly respond in the event that an invasion took place. They received a large amount of new equipment during this time to improve their mobility, including new Universal carriers, weapons and lightweight personal load carrying equipment. They also experienced German air attacks for the first time, and on 8 July 1940, the battalion incurred its first casualty when one of its members was wounded in an air raid. In early October, the 2/10th undertook a large-scale exercise near Tidworth, and then {{in the middle of the}} month, as winter set in they were moved to Colchester, where they replaced the tents they had been living in with the stone buildings and Nissen huts of Hyderabad Barracks. The battalion's stay there was short-lived, though, for the following month, after the threat of invasion had passed, the order arrived for the Australians <b>to</b> <b>embark</b> <b>for</b> the Middle East. The 2/10th subsequently entrained at Colchester in mid-November and moved north to Scotland where, on 17 November, they boarded the Straithaird.|$|E
5|$|David prepares Weyland for an {{excursion}} to the Engineer ship. Shaw asks David {{about his}} freedom after Weyland's eventual demise, {{to which he}} ominously asks about every child's dream of having their parents dead. He leads the team to the flight deck of the ship, where he awakens and speaks with the Engineer, who reacts by decapitating him and killing {{the rest of the}} team, save for Shaw. David's severed head watches from the floor as the Engineer launches the ship and attempts <b>to</b> <b>embark</b> <b>for</b> Earth. After the ship is disabled by Prometheus getting purposefully crashed into it, David warns Shaw that the Engineer is coming for her. David contacts Shaw after she escapes the Engineer and convinces her to retrieve his head and body, so that he may pilot another ship. Shaw dictates that she will cooperate with him if he takes them to the Engineer home world, which he agrees to, despite not understanding her motivations. Together, they depart from the moon aboard an Engineer ship.|$|E

5|$|In August 1899, Gellibrand easily {{passed the}} {{examinations}} for promotion to captain, but was {{passed over for}} the post of adjutant of the 2nd Battalion of the South Lancashire Regiment, then based in St Helens, Merseyside. In October the post became vacant again, {{and this time he}} secured it. The South African War had broken out, and the 2nd Battalion embarked for South Africa on 30 November, but Gellibrand was left behind, in charge of the regimental depot. He eventually received orders <b>to</b> <b>embark</b> <b>for</b> South Africa with reinforcements on 3 January 1900. He arrived in South Africa on 25 January 1900. Soon after, he was given command of D Company. As such he participated in the relief of Ladysmith, leading a bayonet charge on 27 February. His company entered the town on 3 March. Five days later he became ill with typhoid, and lay in a comatose state until 3 April. He was joined in Durban by Elsie, who had made her way out to South Africa with Cecil Rhodes, and they embarked for England together on 26 May, arriving at Southampton on 18 June.|$|E
5|$|While {{waiting at}} Deolali <b>to</b> <b>embark</b> <b>for</b> Egypt, the brigade {{conducted}} regimental and brigade training programmes during which all ranks and animals were inspected, and those found unfit for service {{were returned to}} their regimental depots. Between 27 and 29 October the brigade moved to Bombay for embarkation; six transport ships carrying most of the brigade sailed on 1 November, while a seventh ship carrying two squadrons of Mysore Lancers remained behind with mechanical problems and finally set sail a fortnight later. The {{main body of the}} brigade arrived at Suez on 16 November, travelled by train to Ismailia two days later and started their first war-time patrols {{along the banks of the}} Sweet Water Canal. The brigade was not assigned to a higher formation at this time but were Army Troops under command of General Headquarters. The Bikaner Camel Corps, another Imperial Service unit, was attached to the brigade at Ismailia for administrative purposes, but was not operationally attached. To expand the area the brigade could patrol, squadrons were detached to El Kubri, Kantarah and the Ferry Post crossing at Ismailia. At the same time, the brigade became responsible for patrolling the length of the Suez Canal. The other British forces defending the canal were more static infantry formations, comprising the 42nd (East Lancashire), and the 10th and 11th Indian Divisions, the latter included the Imperial Service Infantry Brigade as one of its three brigades. Their Turkish opponents had around 25,000 men in the region, including the 25th Division.|$|E

25|$|At this {{juncture}} Gustav III {{was approached by}} Jacob Magnus Sprengtporten, a Finnish nobleman, who had incurred the enmity of the Caps, {{with the prospect of}} a revolution. He undertook to seize the fortress of Sveaborg in Finland by a coup de main.

25|$|Under the 1825 army reforms, six {{companies}} {{would be sent}} for overseas service at any one time, whilst four remained in the United Kingdom as a depot. Accordingly, when the regiment was ordered <b>to</b> <b>embark</b> <b>for</b> Jamaica in 1831 it took six of its ten companies. Other than a brief epidemic of yellow fever in 1837, claiming sixty men, the time in Jamaica was uneventful. In July 1838, the Sheerness depot provided the guard of honour for the visit of Marshal Soult.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{commencement}} of hostilities with Japan the 1st Armoured Division {{had been scheduled to}} deploy to the Middle East where it would be fully equipped and complete its training: the 1st Armoured Brigade was <b>to</b> <b>embark</b> <b>for</b> the Middle East in December 1941, with 2nd Armoured Brigade embarking in March 1942. These plans were, however, dropped in early December 1941 when it was decided to retain the division in Australia to defend against the feared Japanese landings on the Australian mainland. As an emergency measure the division's armoured regiments were equipped with Bren Carriers until sufficient tanks arrived.|$|E
50|$|Early in 1941 the {{regiment}} moved to Pembrokeshire, with RHQ at Tenby, and trained at Sennybridge with infantry formations, {{before moving to}} Pontypridd.

Though the penal laws were no longer enforced with extreme severity, the life of many Catholic priests was still a difficult one, especially in London. Disguised as a layman in London, Challoner ministered to his flock there, celebrating Mass secretly in obscure ale-houses, cockpits, and wherever small gatherings could assemble without exciting remark. In this regard, he was an untiring worker, and spent much time in the poorest quarters of the town and in the prisons.|$|E
