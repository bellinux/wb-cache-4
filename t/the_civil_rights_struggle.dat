25|$|Some {{commentators}} {{observe that}} the United States practice of segregation and white supremacy in the South, and discrimination {{in many areas}} outside that region, forced many African Americans to unite in <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>struggle,</b> whereas the fluid nature of race in Brazil has divided individuals of African descent between those with more or less ancestry and helped sustain {{an image of the}} country as an example of post-colonial harmony.

25|$|Scouting has {{sometimes}} become entangled in social controversies such as <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>struggle</b> in the American South and in nationalist resistance movements in India.

There are also controversies and challenges within the Scout Movement itself such as current efforts to turn Scouts Canada into a democratic organization (see also Non-aligned Scouting and Scout-like organisations).|$|E

He held, in an opinion that was followed by later judges, including a series of Black judges who faced recusal requests, that a judge should not be forced to recuse solely because of their membership in a minority group.

[...] Stone commented that [...] "In 10 years and over 150 episodes of South Park, Isaac never had a problem with the show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons and Jews. He got a sudden case of religious sensitivity when it was his religion featured on the show. To bring <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>struggle</b> into this is just a non sequitur.
