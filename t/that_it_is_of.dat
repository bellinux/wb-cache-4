5|$|Multiple {{theories}} {{explaining the}} origin of this lake have been formulated. One version is that it is the remnants of a post-glacial lake, which has undergone drastic changes in size over the years and the other theory is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> fluvial origin from an old flood spill channel or ox-bows of the Jhelum River. The dendritic drainage pattern of the catchment signifies that its rock strata have low levels of porosity. Lithologically, a variety of rock types have been discerned namely, igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary. The Dachigam Telbal Nallah system is conjectured to follow two major lineaments. Discontinuous surfaces seen in the terrain are attributed to the angular and parallel drainage pattern. The water table cuts the hill slopes, which is evidenced by the occurrence of numerous springs in the valley. Seismic activity in the valley is recorded under Zone V of the Seismic Zoning Map of India, the most severe zone where frequent damaging earthquakes of intensity IX could be expected. In the year 2005, Kashmir valley experienced one of the severe earthquakes measured at 7.6 on the Richter's scale, which resulted in deaths and the destruction of many properties, leaving many homeless.|$|E
5|$|Since {{classical}} antiquity, {{the area}} around Kvarner Bay has been characterized as a meeting point of diverse cultures—from Hellenic and Roman cultures, through the Middle Ages and a succession of various rulers, to the present day. This blending {{is reflected in the}} folklore of the area, including Zvončari—bell-ringers best known for annual pageant in Kastav, listed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Crossbowmen from Rab are a living history company reenacting an arbalest tournament first held in 1364 to commemorate the successful defence of the island using that weapon. A typical decorative motif used in the region is morčić (plural: morčići)—a dark skinned Moor used as a centerpiece on jewelry, usually earrings. Legend has it that the motif is related to a hypothesized battle between Croatian and Ottoman armies on Grobnik north of Rijeka, but it is more likely <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> Venetian origin, as it is similar to the Venetian moretti motif, used mostly on brooches and pins.|$|E
5|$|The watch members use {{the group}} {{as an excuse to}} drink and have fun, much to Evan's annoyance. While driving on patrol, they accidentally hit something. They {{discover}} a strange metallic orb that acts as a highly destructive weapon and deduce <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> alien origin. Meanwhile, several more townspeople are mysteriously killed. The watch responds to the murders and encounters an alien, which attacks them. Evan apparently kills it with a lawn gnome before the group returns with the creature to Bob's house. The creature regains consciousness and escapes, stealing the metallic orb and warning them that the aliens have already infiltrated the town. The watch members theorize that the aliens are stealing their victims' skins and disguising themselves as humans, so anyone in Glenview could be an alien. Bob confides to Evan that he is worried about his daughter Chelsea (Erin Moriarty) and does not trust her boyfriend Jason (Nicholas Braun). Evan admits that he has been avoiding his wife Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt) because he is infertile, and reveals his worry that it may cause her to leave.|$|E

25|$|The Champoeg name {{itself has}} an unknown origin. Some {{theories}} {{are that it}} was the Native American's name for the spot along the Willamette River, originally Champooik.

25|$|This second harbour is {{a smaller}} {{facility}} near Onehunga on the Manukau Harbour, south of Auckland City.

25|$|This {{description}} is generally identified {{as part of}} the Priestly source ("P"), written in the sixth or fifth century BCE. However whilst the first Priestly source takes the form of instructions, the second is largely a repetition of the first in the past tense, i.e., it describes the execution of the instructions. Many scholars contend <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> a far later date than the time of Moses, and that the description reflects the structure of Solomon's Temple, while some hold that the description derives from memories of a real pre-monarchic shrine, perhaps the sanctuary at Shiloh. Traditional scholars contend that it describes an actual tabernacle used in the time of Moses and thereafter. According to historical criticism, an earlier, pre-exilic source, the Elohist ("E"), describes the Tabernacle as a simple tent-sanctuary.|$|E

25|$|In every discourse, {{whether of}} the mind conversing with its own thoughts, or of the {{individual}} in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them the limits of discourse are co-extensive {{with those of the}} universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak, as of civilised men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse.|$|E
25|$|The tank at {{the head}} of the small road from Pumsaint to Caio was thought to be modern since it still holds water. However, when the level of the water was low in 1970, it yielded large {{quantities}} of Roman pottery which show <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> Roman origin and built early during their exploitation of the mines. The section shows that it was connected to a smaller tank just below the modern road by a drystone culvert in a cascade. The lower tank also holds water but is in an advanced state of eutrophication. The collection of fragments included Samian ware and coarse ware from over 100 separate pots, and must have fallen into the reservoir when the mines were in full operation. Analysis of the pottery fragments showed a distribution of ages from the late 1st century AD through to the end of the 4th century. Since the fort and fortlet under the present village of Pumsaint ends in the middle of the 2nd century, it shows that mining continued for a long time after the military evacuation.|$|E
500|$|The game (the NES version {{now officially}} titled Shadow Warriors in Europe) was {{reviewed}} again in Mean Machines July 1991 issue.

Glancey compared the game to the 1990 NES version of Batman (which was released later in 1990) with the similarities of wall-jumping mechanics; he said that its graphics were not as well-developed as Batmans but were still satisfactory. He praised its detailed sprites and their animations along with the [...] "Tecmo Theater" [...] concept, noting that the cutscenes [...] "help supply a lot of atmosphere". He said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> the best arcade-style games on the NES as well as the best ninja-related game on the system.|$|E

500|$|But Hazlitt goes further, {{to develop}} an idea that only much later was seen to have radical {{implications}} for literary theory: he claims <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> {{the very nature of}} poetry to glorify the aristocrat, the solitary hero, and the monarch, while being much less suited to represent, in ways that capture the imagination, the social problems of the common people. Poetic [...] "imagination naturally falls in with the language of power. The imagination is an exaggerating and exclusive faculty: it takes from one thing to add to another: it accumulates circumstances together to give the greatest possible effect to a favourite object." [...] On the other hand, the language that would be used to argue the cause of the people relies more on [...] "the understanding", which [...] "is a dividing and measuring faculty: it judges of things not according to their immediate impression on the mind, but according to their relations to one another. [...] Poetry [...] is right-royal. It puts the individual for the species, the one above the infinite many, might before right." ...|$|E
