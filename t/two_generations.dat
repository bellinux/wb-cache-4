5|$|After the Battle of Edington in 878, Alfred {{established}} {{a network of}} fortified settlements, called burhs, in Wessex to protect his people and territory against Viking attacks, and when Æthelred accepted Alfred's lordship the burhs were extended into Mercia. One of the burhs was Worcester, where Æthelred worked with its bishop and used the standing Roman walls in the town's defences. Over the next <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> Worcester was transformed from an ecclesiastical settlement to a town with a diverse population of craftsmen.|$|E
5|$|After {{the early}} deaths of both Lucius and Gaius in AD 2 and 4 respectively, and the earlier {{death of his}} brother Drusus (9BC), Tiberius was {{recalled}} to Rome in June AD 4, where he was adopted by Augustus {{on the condition that}} he, in turn, adopt his nephew Germanicus. This continued the tradition of presenting at least <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> of heirs. In that year, Tiberius was also granted the powers of a tribune and proconsul, emissaries from foreign kings had to pay their respects to him, and by AD 13 was awarded with his second triumph and equal level of imperium with that of Augustus.|$|E
5|$|Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War is a {{tactical}} role-playing {{game in which}} the player takes the roles of Sigurd and his son Seliph {{across a variety of}} story-driven missions on the continent of Jugdral.

50|$|<b>Two</b> <b>generation</b> family {{programs}} aim to get {{parents to}} a place of economic stability and security where they can secure employment that enables them to support their family and improve child outcomes. Programs aid parents in getting to economic security through education and job training opportunities. <b>Two</b> <b>generation</b> program educational opportunities typically involve general educational development (GED) courses, and connections to post-secondary education supports, such as, financial aid or access to full-day childcare. In addition to education services, <b>two</b> <b>generation</b> family programs often utilize sector-based workforce development. This type of workforce development targets job training for specific industries that will meet regional workforce needs, increasing the chances that graduates of the program will be able to find work.|$|R
5|$|Genealogy of the Holy War {{takes place}} on the {{continent}} of Jugdral, split between eight different countries founded by the Twelve Crusaders, an ancient group of soldiers who ended {{the rule of the}} ancient dragon Loptyr with divine aid. In the present, a cult working to revive Loptyr stir up war among the countries. The story is told over <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> — the first generation follows the Grannvalian prince Sigurd, while the second follows his son Seliph as he works to defeat the cult and avenge his father. Gameplay follows the traditional Fire Emblem system of tactical battles taking place on grid-based maps, while adding the Weapons Triangle and Support systems, which directly impacted both gameplay and story.|$|E
5|$|Sericulture, the rearing of silkworms, {{was first}} {{adopted by the}} Chinese during the Shang dynasty. The only species farmed commercially is the domesticated silkmoth. When it spins its cocoon, each larva {{produces}} an exceedingly long, slender thread of silk. The larvae feed on mulberry leaves and in Europe, only one generation is normally raised each year as this is a deciduous tree. In China, Korea and Japan however, <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> are normal, and in the tropics, multiple generations are expected. Most production of silk occurs in the Far East, with a synthetic diet being used to rear the silkworms in Japan.|$|E

5|$|Cucumber {{focuses on}} the life of the middle-aged Henry Best (Vincent Franklin) and the fallout from a {{disastrous}} date with his boyfriend of nine years, and is accompanied with Banana, an E4 anthology series featuring younger characters across the LGBT spectrum {{on the periphery of the}} Cucumber narrative, and Tofu, an online documentary series available on 4oD discussing modern sex, sexuality and issues arisen during the show with the cast and public. The three names reference a urological scale categorising the male erection by hardness from tofu to cucumber, and are used to symbolise differences in sexual attitudes and behaviour between the <b>two</b> <b>generations.</b> Although Cucumber was designed as a self-contained serial focusing {{on the life of}} one man, Davies envisioned Banana as open-ended with the potential to continue after its sister series finished.|$|E
5|$|Harmonia {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world {{sometime}} in the future. A rapid decline in human civilization began once the population hit its peak of 10 billion, caused in part by pollution and war. During this time, artificially intelligent, emotional androids called Phiroids were developed to serve as partners for humans. Although Phiroids were originally powered by batteries for the first <b>two</b> <b>generations,</b> they were afterwards developed to be powered by eating food, making them nearly indistinguishable from humans. Artificial memories could also be implanted into the Phiroids, making them highly desirable, leading them to be produced in numbers that eventually rivaled the human population {{at a time when the}} birth rate was already in decline. Eventually, nuclear warfare and the resulting nuclear fallout killed off most of humanity, culminating in a world covered in dark clouds and ash blocking out sunlight, land stripped of vegetation, and an ocean that could no longer support life. Some people were placed in cryogenic facilities in an attempt to sleep long enough until the environment improved even a little bit.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this theory}} allowed a {{compound}} symmetry CP to be conserved. CP combines parity P (switching left to right) with charge conjugation C (switching particles with antiparticles). Physicists were again surprised when in 1964, James Cronin and Val Fitch provided clear evidence in kaon decays that CP symmetry could be broken too, winning them the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1973, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa showed that CP violation in the weak interaction required more than <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> of particles, effectively predicting {{the existence of}} a then unknown third generation. This discovery earned them half of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics. Unlike parity violation, CP violation occurs in {{only a small number of}} instances, but remains widely held as an answer to the difference between the amount of matter and antimatter in the universe; it thus forms one of Andrei Sakharov's three conditions for baryogenesis.|$|E

5|$|Jacob Borch {{constructed}} Liebe House in 1804 on {{the site}} next to the sugar factory. It replaced a modest house with timber framing and a straw roof dating from the 17th century. The building {{takes its name from}} the Liebe family who owned the property for <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> later in the century. On the occasion of his death in 1900, Liebe left the entire building complex to Roskilde Municipality. In 1908, the Sugar House came into use as a fire station. Roskilde Local History Museum was founded on 12 November 1929 {{on the ground floor of}} the Liebe House. When the fire station moved to new premises in 1989, Roskilde Museum took over the Sugar House. The museum has exhibits from prehistory, through the Viking Era and the Middle Ages to modern times. The Museum of Tools, housed in separate premises, contains a collection of tools used by craftsmen such as wheelrights, carpenters, shoemakers and wood carvers from around 1850 to 1950.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of antiquity, monarchy confronted several republican forms of government, wherein executive power was {{in the hands of}} a number of people, that elected leaders in a certain way instead of appointing them by hereditary succession. During the archaic period (c. 750–500 BCE), kingship disappeared in almost all Greek poleis, and also in Rome (then still a barely significant town). After the demise of kingship, the Greek city-states were initially most often led by nobility (aristocracy), after which their economic and military power base crumbled. Next, in almost all poleis tyrants usurped power for <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> (tyranny, 7th and especially 6th century BCE), after which gradually forms of governments led by the wealthy (oligarchy) or assemblies of free male citizens (democracy) emerged in Classical Greece (mainly after 500 BCE). Athenian democracy (6th century–322 BCE) is the best-known example of the latter form; classical Sparta (c. 550–371 BCE) was a militaristic polis with a remarkable mix between monarchy (dual kingship), aristocracy (Gerousia) and democracy (Apella); the Roman Republic (c. 509–27 BCE) had a mixed constitution of oligarchy, democracy and especially aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|The King and his {{advisers}} {{were concerned about the}} rise of socialism and the growing labour movement, which they mistakenly associated with republicanism. The socialists no longer believed in their anti-monarchical slogans and were ready {{to come to terms with}} the monarchy if it took the first step. George adopted a more democratic, inclusive stance that crossed class lines and brought the monarchy closer to the public and the working class—a dramatic change for the King, who was most comfortable with naval officers and landed gentry. He cultivated friendly relations with moderate Labour party politicians and trade union officials. His abandonment of social aloofness conditioned the royal family's behaviour and enhanced its popularity during the economic crises of the 1920s and for over <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> thereafter.|$|E

40|$|A {{possible}} {{resolution of}} the flavor puzzle is that the fermion mass hierarchy can be dynamically generated through the coupling of the first <b>two</b> <b>generation</b> fields to a strongly coupled sector, which is approximately conformally invariant and leads to large anomalous dimensions for the first <b>two</b> <b>generation</b> fields over a large range of energies. We investigate {{the possibility of using}} the same sector to also break supersymmetry. We show that this automatically gives an "inverted hierarchy" in which the first <b>two</b> <b>generation</b> squarks and sleptons are much heavier than the other superpartners. Implementing this construction generically requires some fine-tuning in order to satisfy the constraints on flavor-changing neutral currents {{at the same time as}} solving the hierarchy problem. We show that this fine-tuning can be reduced to be milder than the percent level by making some technically natural assumptions about the form of the strongly coupled sector and its couplings to the standard model.

5|$|Two {{significant}} {{items of}} jewellery from Northumbria {{in this period}} have survived. The Ripon Jewel, discovered in the precincts of Ripon Cathedral in 1977, is difficult to date but its grandeur {{and the location of}} the find have suggested a link with Bishop Wilfrid, whose rich furnishings of the church at Ripon are on record. Bishop Cuthbert's pectoral cross was buried with him during Aldfrith's reign, either at his death in 687 or his reburial in 698 and is now at Durham Cathedral. There are few surviving architectural or monumental remains from the period. The Bewcastle Cross, the Ruthwell Cross and the Hexham Cross are probably to be dated to one or <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> after Aldfrith's time. Escomb Church is the best preserved Northumbrian church of the period, dated to the late 7th century. The ruined chapel at Heysham, overlooking Morecambe Bay, may be somewhat later in date.|$|E
5|$|When Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne in 1660, Bennett was removed from his post as constable. He was initially replaced by Thomas Rosse and then, in 1661, by Philip Piper. A gaol {{was built in the}} centre of the bailey in the late-17th century; it was bought by the constable and was adopted as the county gaol. In 1690, the county complained to the King that the constable, Sir Hugh Pyper, had allowed it to fall into disrepair and that the male and female prisoners were sleeping together in the same quarters. Two years later, the Crown granted the post of constable in perpetuity to Hugh and for <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> after him; in exchange, Hugh agreed to invest £120 in repairing the facility. The bailey was also used for carrying out executions.|$|E
