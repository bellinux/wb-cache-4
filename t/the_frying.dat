5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Isabel were {{generally}} {{light in the}} southeastern portion of the state. Sustained winds reached 72mph (116km/h) offshore in <b>the</b> <b>Frying</b> Pan Shoals, where a gust of 82mph (132km/h) was also reported. Sustained winds were lighter along the coast, peaking at 45mph (72km/h) at the Wilmington International Airport, while gusts reached 66mph (106km/h) at a North Carolina State Ports Authority facility in Wilmington. Tropical storm force wind gusts were reported as far inland as Lumberton, where gusts reached 52mph (54km/h). The large circulation of Isabel dropped moderate rainfall across the area, peaking at 4.51inches (115mm) in Whiteville. Additionally, weather radars estimated over 5inches (125mm) of precipitation fell in portions of New Hanover County. The rainfall resulted in ponding on roadways, though no severe flooding was reported. Storm tides were generally around 1foot (0.3m) above normal, though Wilmington reported a storm tide of 3.22feet (1m). Rough waves resulted in moderate beach erosion near Cape Fear and minor erosion along eastward-facing beaches north of Cape Fear.|$|E
5|$|On September1, the Venezuelan tanker Acosta relayed an SOS signal while {{near the}} {{hurricane}} 200mi (320km) southeast of <b>the</b> <b>Frying</b> Pan Shoals. United States Coast Guard stations in Norfolk, Virginia and Morehead City, North Carolina dispatched cutters {{to aid the}} ship. Off of the East Coast, {{an offshoot of the}} hurricane resulted in the drownings of two people. In the Mid-Atlantic states, the passing hurricane's outflow interacted with a cold front that had become quasi-stationary over the area. The cyclone's flow pattern enhanced the moisture environment over the region, resulting in locally heavy rainfall, particularly in New Jersey, where precipitation peaked at 24in (610mm) in Ewan in a nine-hour period on September1. This would make the hurricane the wettest tropical cyclone in state history. Most of the rain was in western portions of the state, however, with minimal rainfall at the coast. The floods caused small rivers to overflow, breaching dams. An overflowed creek inundated parts of Lumberton Township, rendering 2,000people homeless. Rail service between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and areas of southern New Jersey was suspended as a result of washed out tracks. Resulting damage to infrastructure totaled $4,000,000in the southwestern quarter of New Jersey alone. Damage to roads in Burlington County amounted to $2,500,000. In Camden County, damage was estimated at $1million. Four fatalities were reported {{as a result of the}} floods. In Delaware, rainfall was comparatively less. However, rough seas generated by the hurricane offshore caused $50,000 in damages and one death. Further north, strong gusts were reported across New England. Winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) were recorded by a weather station in Nantucket. Peak winds in Massachusetts were estimated at 65 mph (100 km/h). In Eastport, Maine, winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) were reported.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of growing}} {{territorial}} domain and evangelical missions, a command outpost or Commandancia in the Upper Pampanga River area was established. Then Governor-General Fausto Cruzat y Góngora (July 25, 1690 to December 8, 1701) had most likely {{spent much of}} his time in the northern outpost in Carranglan and Pantabangan and, baking in the fiercely hot climate, probably waxed nostalgic about his hometown in Ecija, Andalusia in Spain. Ecija, Andalusia was also known as la sarten or <b>the</b> <b>frying</b> pan because of its intensely hot summers. Thus the Governor-General hit upon the notion to name the outpost Nueva Ecija. Both the New and Old Ecija were washed by navigable rivers- the former, by Rio Grande de Pampanga and the latter, by the river Genil.|$|E

25|$|Trans fats {{are used}} in {{shortenings}} for deep-frying in restaurants, {{as they can be}} used for longer than most conventional oils before becoming rancid. In the early 21st century, non-hydrogenated vegetable oils that have lifespans exceeding that of <b>the</b> <b>frying</b> shortenings became available. As fast-food chains routinely use different fats in different locations, trans fat levels in fast food can have large variations. For example, an analysis of samples of McDonald's French fries collected in 2004 and 2005 found that fries served in New York City contained twice as much trans fat as in Hungary, and 28 times as much as in Denmark, where trans fats are restricted. At KFC, the pattern was reversed, with Hungary's product containing twice the trans fat of the New York product. Even within the United States there was variation, with fries in New York containing 30% more trans fat than those from Atlanta.|$|E

500|$|Overheating or over-using <b>the</b> <b>frying</b> oil {{leads to}} {{formation}} of rancid-tasting products of oxidation, polymerization, and other deleterious, unintended or even toxic compounds such as acrylamide (from starchy foods). [...] Recent research suggests fat deterioration may be worse when fat or oil is fried with food than when fat or oil is tested {{on its own}} in a laboratory. Deep-frying under vacuum helps to significantly reduce acrylamide formation, but this process is not widely used in the food industry due to the high investment cost involved.|$|E

[...] The Times recorded that [...] "potatoes chipped and fried in the French manner were introduced in Lancashire with great success about 1871." [...] Fish and chip shops in the 1920s were often run by Jews or Italians.

The mushrooms are sold in rural markets in France, Spain, Turkey, and Yunnan Province, China. They are also collected by locals in the upper valley of the Serchio River in central Italy. In Spain, where the mushroom is esteemed as a culinary delicacy in Catalan cuisine, it is known as níscalos (in Spanish) or rovelló (in Catalan). In Cyprus, it is known as γαιματάς (meaning [...] "the bloody one") and it is widely collected by the locals, but considered inferior to the saffron milk cap (Lactarius deliciosus). In India, young specimens are consumed along with L.deliciosus; and some consider L.sanguifluus to have a better flavor than its more well-known relative.

500|$|KFC's {{core product}} {{offering}} is pressure fried, on-the-bone chicken pieces seasoned with Colonel Harland Sanders' [...] "Original Recipe" [...] of 11 herbs and spices. The product is typically available in either {{two or three}} piece individual servings, or in a family size cardboard bucket, typically holding between 6 and 16 chicken pieces. Poultry is divided into 9 different cuts (2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, 2 wings, 1 keel, and a backbone-based breast cut divided into 2 pieces). The product is hand-breaded at individual KFC outlets with wheat flour mixed with seasoning in a two- to four-minute process. It is then pressure fried for between seven and ten minutes (the timing differs between countries) in oil at 185 degrees Celsius. Following this, the chicken is left to stand for 5 minutes in order for it to sufficiently cool before it {{is placed in the}} warming oven. It is KFC policy to discard chicken if it has not been sold within 90 minutes, in order to ensure freshness. <b>The</b> <b>frying</b> oil varies regionally, and versions used include sunflower, soybean, rapeseed and palm oil.
