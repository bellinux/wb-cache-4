Several groups blocked adoption of PEX for concerns about chemicals {{getting into the}} water, either from chemicals outside the pipes, or from chemicals inside the pipes such as methyl tertiary butyl ether and <b>tertiary</b> <b>butyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> These concerns delayed statewide adoption of PEX for almost a decade. After substantial [...] "back-and-forth legal wrangling", which {{was described as a}} [...] "judicial rollercoaster", the disputing groups came to a consensus, and California permitted use of PEX in all occupancies. An environmental impact report and subsequent studies determined there were no causes for concerns about public health from use of PEX piping.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} the protective role of epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate on <b>tertiary</b> <b>butyl</b> hydroperoxide induced oxidative damage in erythrocyte during aging in humans. Methods: Human erythrocyte membrane bound Ca 2 +-ATPase and Na+/K+-ATPase activities were determined as a function of human age. Protective role of epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate was evaluated by in vitro experiments by adding epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate in concentration dependent manner (final concentration range 10 - 7 M to 10 - 4 M) to the enzyme assay medium. Oxidative stress was induced in vitro by incubating washed erythrocyte ghosts with <b>tertiary</b> <b>butyl</b> hydroperoxide (10 - 5 M final concentration). Results: We have reported concentration dependent effect of epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate on <b>tertiary</b> <b>butyl</b> hydroperoxide induced damage on activities of Ca 2 +-ATPase and Na+/K+-ATPase during aging in humans. We have detected a significant (p < 0. 001) decreased activity of Ca 2 +-ATPase and Na+/K+ -ATPase as a function of human age. Epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate protected ATPases against <b>tertiary</b> <b>butyl</b> hydroperoxide induced damage in concentration dependent manner during aging in humans. Conclusion: Epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate is a powerful antioxidant that is capable of protecting erythrocyte Ca 2 +-ATPase and Na+/K+ -ATPase against oxidative stress during aging in humans. We may propose hypothesis that a high intake of catechin rich diet may provide some protection against development of aging and age related diseases...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we discuss}} the {{connection}} between the anomalies of the thermodynamic properties, experimentally observed in <b>tertiary</b> <b>butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (TBA) and water solutions, and the molecular clustering in these solutions, as revealed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These anomalies are observed in relatively dilute solutions of about 0. 03 to 0. 08 mole fraction of TBA and become more pronounced at low temperatures. MD simulations show that these solutions exhibit shortranged (order of 1 nm), shortlived (tens of picoseconds) "micelle-like" structural fluctuations in the same concentration range. We attribute the anomalies in the thermodynamic properties of aqueous TBA solutions to these structural fluctuations on the molecular scale.

40|$|The ketonization of {{acetic acid}} {{has been studied}} on a chromia {{catalyst}} at 460 °C and at a contact time of 0. 7 set at various partial pressures in presence of <b>tertiary</b> <b>butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and benzyl alcohol. There is no inhibition of the ketonisation of acetic acid in presence of <b>tertiary</b> <b>butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> which undergoes only dehydration giving isobutylene and water. &nay 1 alcohol, which undergoes only dehydrogenation to give benzaldehyde and hydrogen, suppresses the ketonization of acetic acid. Comparative studies of the reaction of isopropyl alcohol in mixture with acetic acid and also with propionic acid, under identical conditions, confirm {{the conclusion that the}} ketonization is caused by the same activity of the catalyst that is re-sponsible for dehydration and dehydrogenation. It is suggested that the ketonization occurs through the interaction of two acetic acid molecules adsorbed on the surface of chromia, one of them utilizing the dehydrogenation activity for adsorption and the other utilizing the dehydration activity. Earlier work (1, 2) has shown that acetic acid decomposes on chromia at 460 °C to give acetone, water, and carbon dioxide and {{it has been suggested that}} acetic acid utilizes only the primary ac-tivities of chromia, viz., dehydration and dehydrogenation for ketonization purposes. Further studies have been conducted to determine the exact type of activity that promotes ketonization and to establish the mechanism of ketonization of acetic acid on chromia. The present paper deals with the results obtained in these studies. METHODS A flow type reaction unit as described in an earlier paper (1) was used in the present studies.

Since the pioneer work of Fitz and Pasteur, some twenty-five writers have described organ-isms which produce <b>butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> from carbohydrate material. The biological production of acetone was not noted until later (1904), but it is highly probable that all the forms which produce <b>butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> likewise form acetone, and that the majority of those described in the literature belong to a single species.

40|$|II <b>Tertiary</b> <b>butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (TBA) {{is used as}} a fuel {{oxygenate}} and is {{the main}} breakdown component of methyl tert butyl ether (MTBE).

Wastewater removal of tert butyl alcohol (TBA) has been limited to methodology used by MTBE or by anaerobic or aerobic methods. Neither set of techniques is applicable to TBA due to its long biological degradation period, its very specific conditions for anerobic or aerobic treatment, and its low Henry’s law constant, low transformation rate, and its high mobility.

These materials are useful as intermediates which contain a halogen in the plus one valence state, and applicable to the manufacture of industrial chemicals uch as propylene oxide (2) and calcium hypochlorite (3 - 5).
