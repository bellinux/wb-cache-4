5|$|Lastly, British efforts <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> and {{disguise}} {{the nature and}} impact of the revolutionary movement at this time also resulted in a policy designed to strengthen the moderate movement in India, which ultimately saw Gandhi's rise in the Indian movement.|$|E
5|$|Because Eastern European Romani {{communities}} were less organised than Jewish communities, Porajmos {{was not well}} documented. There also existed a trend <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> the actual figures, according to Ian Hancock, director of the Program of Romani Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. Tony Gatlif, whose films mostly have Romani people as subjects, had long {{wanted to make a}} documentary on this less well-known subject, but the lack of enough documented evidence coupled with the absence of accurate pre-war census figures for the Romani made it difficult.|$|E
5|$|The Rüstungsstab assumed {{responsibilities}} for the underground transfer projects of the Jägerstab. In November 1944, 1.8 million square meters of underground space {{were ready for}} occupancy, encompassing over 1,000 spaces commissioned by the task force. (Post-war, Speer sought <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> his involvement with these projects and claimed that only 300,000 square meters had been completed). According Buggeln, the Rüstungsstab {{played a key role}} in maintaining and increasing production of fighter aircraft and V-2 rockets.|$|E
5000|$|Nellee Hooper remixed [...] "#1 Crush" [...] for {{inclusion}} on the Romeo + Juliet soundtrack, working with producers Marius de Vries and Jim Abbiss. In addition <b>to</b> <b>downplaying</b> the guitars and reworking the percussion and synth {{elements of the}} song, Hooper added a distorted vocal sample from Madonna's 1995 single [...] "Bedtime Story".|$|R

50|$|Isaac Casaubon, De rebus sacris et ecclesiasticus exercitationes (1614) makes a third {{familiar}} example, where sound scholarship {{was somewhat}} compromised by sectarian pleading. Thus such pagan precedents for Christian practice have tended <b>to</b> be <b>downplayed</b> or even sometimes dismissed by Christian apologists {{as a form}} of Protestant Apologetics.|$|R
5|$|Elsewhere, French {{public opinion}} was {{strongly}} {{in favour of}} the outcome of the conference, the only criticism coming from the far left that Republican ships would not receive direct protection. The German mood was restrained, where the press were satisfied by the Soviet exclusion from patrols. In Spain, the Republicans– on the verge of disaster– were largely in favour, and the Nationalists strongly against. The Republicans praised the improved safety of the shipping routes, but were somewhat unhappy that belligerent rights had not been granted to both sides. The Nationalists made several complaints, including one over the route recommended to shipping, but none of these resulted in changes to the agreement. The agreement was welcomed by other members of the League of Nations. Italian historians tend <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> the importance of the Nyon Conference, often seeing it as a mere extension of the Non-Intervention Committee.|$|E
5|$|Heliade {{was aware}} of the often {{negative}} response to his work: in a poem dedicated to the memory of Friedrich Schiller, he expanded on the contrast between creation and social setting (in reference to mankind, it stressed Te iartă să faci răul, iar binele nici mort—"They forgive the evil committed against them, but never the good"). A noted author of satire, he used it as a vehicle to criticize social customs of his day, as well as to publicize personal conflicts and resentments. As a maverick, he attacked political figures on both sides: conservatives who mimicked liberalism were the subject of his Areopagiul bestielor ("The Areopagus of the Beasts"), while many other of his post-1848 prose and poetry pieces mocked people on the left wing of liberalism, most notably C. A. Rosetti and his supporters. During and after his exile, his conflicts with Cezar Bolliac and Ion Ghica also made the latter two the target of irony, most likely based on Heliade's belief that they intended <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> his contributions to the Wallachian Revolution of 1848.|$|E
5|$|Michael and Dwight {{meet with}} Jan, {{who is now}} a fairly {{successful}} office manager for a hospital and single mother. After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and he watches her play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals that he has herpes. He meets with Helene, Pam's mother, who is playing with CeCe at a playground; after an awkward conversation in which she also points out his skewed memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets with Carol while she is conducting an open house. Carol attempts to be polite, but then abruptly points out his faults too. Finally, Michael calls Holly one last time, only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message that what she said hurt him and that when he saw all his other exes, he had not been happy to see any of them, but when he talked to her, he was happy. He says that does not understand why she wants <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> what they had, but he remembers their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds that she should be tested for herpes.|$|E
50|$|For example, the {{proposed}} curriculum would downplay Thomas Jefferson's {{emphasis on the}} separation of church and state (outlined in his Letter to Danbury Baptists), and would include a greater emphasis on the importance of religion to the founding fathers. Other changes include downplaying Abraham Lincoln's role in the civil war and putting more emphasis on the Confederate leader Jefferson Davis, questioning the Civil Rights Movement in addition <b>to</b> <b>downplaying</b> Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy, removing such instances and points of history such as downplaying slavery, putting more emphasis on the states rights cause during the Civil War. Critics of {{the proposed}} changes believe that such a focus on the religious elements of the founding period could cause teachers to omit lessons on history more pertinent to national standards.|$|R
5000|$|Ulrika's best friend, {{whom she}} drags {{along with her}} when Ulrika enrolls in Al-Revis. She has a dark {{personality}} and views almost everyone as her guinea pigs {{to be used in}} her experiments. She is mostly quiet, calm and collected... though whenever she speaks, her words are either insulting or belittling. She calls the items she makes [...] "omajinai", which sort of means [...] "good luck charm" [...] instead of the term [...] "curse" [...] (noroi) which Ulrika refers to them as. In the English version, she refers to them as [...] "incantations" [...] and seems <b>to</b> be <b>downplayed</b> <b>to</b> the point of being very gloomy.|$|R
25|$|Kennedy was {{consigned}} {{to the political}} shadows after his remarks during World War II ("Democracy is finished"), and he remained an intensely controversial figure among U.S. citizens because of his suspect business credentials, his Roman Catholicism, his opposition to Roosevelt's foreign policy, and his support for Joseph McCarthy. As a result, his presence in John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign had <b>to</b> be <b>downplayed.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{conquest of}} Nanking had been quicker and easier than the Japanese had foreseen; they lost only 1,953 {{soldiers}} in battle, plus 4,994 wounded. Japan's casualties were undoubtedly dwarfed {{by those of}} China, though no precise figures exist on how many Chinese were killed in action. The Japanese claimed to have killed up to 84,000 enemies during the Nanking campaign whereas a contemporary Chinese source claimed that their army suffered 20,000 casualties. Masahiro Yamamoto noted that the Japanese usually inflated their opponent's body counts while the Chinese had reason <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> the scale of their loss. Ikuhiko Hata estimates that 50,000 Chinese soldiers were killed in combat during the entire battle whereas Jay Taylor puts the number at 70,000 and states that proportionate {{to the size of}} the force committed, such losses were greater than those suffered in the devastating Battle of Shanghai. On the other hand, Chinese scholar Sun Zhaiwei estimates Chinese combat losses at 6,000 to 10,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Within {{less than}} a week of the mutiny, a Court of Inquiry was set up to {{investigate}} and collect evidence for the trial for the mutineers. Although the Court of Inquiry was meant to take place behind closed doors, as accordance with standard military procedures, the proceeding was held in public instead. According to Harper and Miller this was to give the public the impression that the mutineers “were being tried for mutiny and shooting with intent to kill and not, as alleged for refusal to go to Turkey’’. Although the Court of Inquiry was clearly trying <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> the link between Turkey and the mutiny, with the declassification of new documents and evidence, another perception has emerged in explaining the cause of the mutiny and that is the role of pan-Islamism. Contrary to official British colonial authorities, the mutiny was not an isolated case of a purely local affair but was instead part of a wider anti-British and pro-Muslim battle.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, the British efforts <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> and {{disguise}} {{the nature and}} impact of the revolutionary movement at this time also resulted in a policy designed to strengthen the moderatist movement in India, which ultimately saw Gandhi's rise in the Indian movement.|$|E
50|$|The {{rift between}} CSN and MSM plays {{into the history}} of the movement. In January, 2005 upon the death of ousted Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, CSN raised its {{estimate}} to 3,001 dead in the Tiananmen crackdown. CSN proceeded to be critical of the MSM, and MSM proceeded <b>to</b> minimize, <b>downplay,</b> ignore, or underreport movement news and China's human rights abuse.|$|R
5000|$|After Tyler's resignation, Marco Rubio called Cruz [...] "a liar" [...] {{during the}} Houston CNN/Telemundo debate held February 25; Donald Trump {{repeated}} the [...] "a liar" [...] phrase targeting Cruz in that CNN debate {{and the two}} campaigns attributed the threads of alleged past deceit in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Super Tuesday directly <b>to</b> Cruz, <b>downplaying</b> the Tyler resignation.|$|R

25|$|In 2007, Wiesel {{was awarded}} the Dayton Literary Peace Prize's Lifetime Achievement Award. That same year, the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity issued a letter condemning Armenian {{genocide}} denial, a letter that was signed by 53 Nobel laureates including Wiesel. Wiesel has repeatedly called Turkey's 90-year-old campaign <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> its actions during the Armenian genocide a double killing.|$|E
25|$|Günther's work {{agreed with}} Grant's, and the German {{anthropologist}} frequently {{stated that the}} Germans are definitely not a fully Nordic people.

25|$|As it {{was aware}} that the German public {{did not support the}} Kristallnacht, the {{propaganda}} ministry directed the German press to portray opponents of racial persecution as disloyal. The press was also under orders <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> the Kristallnacht, describing general events at local level only, with prohibition against depictions of individual events. In 1939 this was extended to a prohibition on reporting any anti-Jewish measures.|$|E
25|$|Corruption in {{the police}} force is a {{significant}} problem in the country. First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Vladimir Vasilev claimed that 1,700 police persons were convicted of bribery or abuse of office in 2001 {{and the problem of}} corruption was under control. But according to most observers, in reality the level of police corruption is much higher and state officials like <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> the problem of corruption.|$|E

25|$|Some {{experts on}} {{securities}} law such as Duke University law professor James Cox, believed the suit had merit because Goldman {{was aware of}} the relevance of Paulson's involvement and took steps <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> it.

25|$|The Republicans also imposed tariffs {{designed}} to protect the infant industries that had been created when Britain was blockading the U.S. With the collapse of the Federalists as a party, the adoption of many Federalist principles by the Republicans, and the systematic policy of President James Monroe in his two terms (1817–25) <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> partisanship, the nation entered an Era of Good Feelings, with far less partisanship than before (or after), and closed out the First Party System.|$|E
25|$|During {{their war}} against the Nicaraguan government, the Contras {{committed}} {{a large number of}} human rights violations and used terrorist tactics, carrying out more than 1300 terrorist attacks. These actions were frequently carried out systematically {{as a part of the}} strategy of the Contras.

40|$|Anyone {{familiar}} with Richard Kraut's work in ancient philosophy will be {{excited to see}} him putting aside the dusty tomes of the ancients and delving into ethics first-hand. He does not disappoint. His book is a lucid and wide-ranging discussion that provides at least the core of an ethical theory and an appealing set of answers {{to a range of}} ethical questions. Kraut aims to provide an alternative to utilitarianism that preserves the good-centred nature of that theory. He claims that all justification ‘proceeds by way of good and bad’ and that the only way for something to be good or bad is for it to be good or bad for some living thing. He is adamant that this does not commit him to utilitarianism, nor <b>to</b> <b>downplaying</b> considerations such as promise-keeping or special relationships. On Kraut's view, such factors can make it the case that I have more reason to perform one action than another but it is a condition of my having any reason to perform an action that it does some good or impedes some harm. Kraut once seems to dissent from this, claiming that: ‘the strength of a practical reason varies according to …...|$|R
