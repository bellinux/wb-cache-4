5|$|Riego's Revolt had two {{significant}} {{effects on the}} war in the Americas. Militarily, the large numbers of reinforcements, which were especially needed to retake New Granada and defend the Viceroyalty of Peru, would never arrive. Furthermore, as the royalists' situation became more desperate in region after region, the army experienced wholesale defections of units to the patriot side. Politically, the reinstitution of a liberal regime changed the terms under which the Spanish government sought to engage <b>the</b> <b>insurgents.</b> The new government naively assumed that <b>the</b> <b>insurgents</b> were fighting for Spanish liberalism and that the Spanish Constitution could still be the basis of reconciliation between the two sides. The government implemented the Constitution and held elections in the overseas provinces, just as in Spain. It also ordered military commanders to begin armistice negotiations with <b>the</b> <b>insurgents</b> with the promise that they could participate in the restored representative government.|$|E
5|$|Vietnamese {{documentation}} {{challenges the}} French assertions. The imperial records, written communications between Gian and Định, and {{the account of}} the southern insurgency written by a resistance figure named Nguyen Thong support the contention that Định's guerrillas operated independently of Huế and in violation of its orders. The imperial records hold that Tự Đức immediately ordered <b>the</b> <b>insurgents</b> to disband, fearing that their actions were an obstacle to his plan of negotiating the return of the lost territory. The records assert that Tự Đức ordered his officials to prevent <b>the</b> <b>insurgents</b> from returning to independent Vietnamese land and to arrest those who did so. Messengers were sent from Huế into the south with the intention of discouraging <b>the</b> <b>insurgents,</b> rather than fomenting resistance.|$|E
40|$|In the {{counterinsurgency}} fight, <b>the</b> <b>insurgent</b> has <b>the</b> tactical initiative {{because he}} is able to pick the time, place, and intensity of his own engagements. <b>The</b> <b>insurgent's</b> environment, however, is a very difficult one despite his initiative. <b>The</b> <b>insurgent</b> must balance <b>the</b> mutually exclusive requirements of hiding (operational security) and fighting (operational effectiveness) in order to gain/maintain legitimacy without being prematurely destroyed by the state. What if the state could influence this balance? What if there was a way for the state to directly target <b>the</b> <b>insurgent's</b> resource allocation between these competing requirements? Typically, states attempt this through influencing the population to support the state and reject <b>the</b> <b>insurgent.</b> But what if the state could use <b>the</b> <b>insurgent's</b> own propaganda machine against itself? Through mathematical modeling, I will show that Black PSYOP enables the state to make strategic moves on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>insurgent</b> that are so detrimental to his cause that he must act in order to counter "his own" moves. In this way, the state is able to turn "Satan" against himself. "How shall then his kingdom stand?" [...] -Matthew 12 : 26. US Army (USA) author...|$|R

5|$|According to Pucar, the Prijedor Company was {{directed}} to attack Ljubija. On 30July, contrary to Stojanović's direct order, <b>the</b> <b>insurgents</b> attacked Veliko Palančište and rescued fifteen hostages held by the Ustaše. <b>The</b> <b>insurgents</b> then advanced toward Prijedor and developed a position facing the town, which was defended by Croatian Home Guards, Ustaše, and German forces. A front line stabilised {{after three days of}} fighting, leaving the Prijedor Company in control of seven villages. Railway traffic between Ljubija and Zagreb was disrupted, stopping the export of iron ore from Ljubija to Germany. The uprising in Kozara also involved the districts of Dubica and Novi. By mid-August, five detachments of Partisans had been formed within the territory held by the Kozara insurgents. These detachments, including the Prijedor Detachment commanded by Stojanović, together held the front line facing Kozarac, Prijedor, Lješljani, Dobrljin, Kostajnica, and Dubica.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disbanding}} of the camps, {{the defeated}} {{forces of the}} former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign into Rwanda from North Kivu. <b>The</b> <b>insurgents</b> maintained a presence in Rwanda's north western provinces and were supported by the predominantly Hutu population, {{many of whom had}} lived in the refugee camps before they were attacked. In addition to supporting the wars in the Congo, Kagame began a propaganda campaign to bring the Hutu to his side. He integrated former soldiers of the deposed genocidal regime's military into the RPF-dominated national army and appointed senior Hutu to key local government positions in the areas hit by insurgency. These tactics were eventually successful; by 1999, the population in the north west had stopped supporting the insurgency and <b>the</b> <b>insurgents</b> were mostly defeated.|$|E

Although most insurgents managed to escape, one was captured and killed, with his head being removed and staked on a pole in the middle of Semarang as a warning for other would-be insurgents. Meanwhile, in nearby Demak and Grobogan ethnic Chinese gathered in large assemblies and chose a new emperor, Singseh, and attempted to found their own nation.

5|$|On March31 <b>the</b> <b>insurgents</b> {{kept their}} {{part of the}} {{agreement}} by allowing the supply bill to be passed on second reading and the budget to be hoisted for ninety days. However, when the cabinet introduced its promised bill, <b>the</b> <b>insurgents</b> claimed {{that it was not}} as agreed and refused to support it. Instead, they demanded Aberhart's resignation and announced that they were prepared to take over the government within 24hours. A delegation put this demand to Aberhart in the evening of March31; according to them, he agreed to resign if they allowed the supply bill to pass a third reading. They did so, but Aberhart denied that he had agreed to resign and refused to do so unless he was defeated in a general election. <b>The</b> <b>insurgents,</b> leery of Aberhart's oratorical powers and the reach of his weekly radio show, wanted to avoid an election. Even so, they rejected a motion by Low to raise their pay for the session by $200, seeing it as a crass bribe.|$|E
5|$|Surprised by Aberhart's {{refusal to}} be drawn into open conflict, <b>the</b> <b>insurgents</b> needed time to {{reassess}} their strategy. They got that time when, on March17, Lieutenant-Governor Primrose died, necessitating a five-day adjournment while the federal government selected a replacement. When the legislature reconvened March 22 or 23, the dissidents filibustered against the budget. Albert Bourcier opened debate, and was followed by, among others, Edith Rogers, Ansley, and Wilson Cain. On March24, Harry Knowlton Brown moved an adjournment, which was carried over the government's objections by a vote of 27 to 25. Though <b>the</b> <b>insurgents</b> considered this a vote of non-confidence in Aberhart's government, he refused to resign; he acknowledged, however, that he would do so if the budget itself was defeated.|$|E

Shortly after Christmas, as <b>the</b> <b>insurgents</b> were gearing up for their final offensive, Sihanouk spoke with the French diplomat Etienne Manac'h. He said that his hopes for a moderate socialism akin to Yugoslavia's must now be totally dismissed. Stalinist Albania, he said, would be the model.|$|E

5|$|The 1991 Yugoslav {{campaign}} in Croatia {{was a series}} of engagements between the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), the Yugoslav Navy and the Yugoslav Air Force, and the Croatian National Guard (ZNG) then the Croatian Army (HV) during the Croatian War of Independence. The JNA was originally deployed in order to preserve Yugoslavia, and the initial plan of the campaign entailed the military occupation of Croatia and the removal of the Croatian leadership elected in 1990. The JNA intervention was the culmination of its involvement in the confiscation of weapons from Croatia's Territorial Defence, and in the Croatian Serb revolt that had begun in August 1990. From that time, the JNA had been frequently deployed to form a buffer zone between <b>the</b> <b>insurgents</b> and the ZNG or the Croatian police. In effect, these JNA buffer zones often secured the territorial gains of <b>the</b> <b>insurgents</b> and led to an increasingly hostile relationship between the JNA and Croatia. The JNA campaign plan was amended shortly before the campaign to include the relief of JNA barracks besieged by the ZNG. The besieging and subsequent capture of several JNA facilities allowed Croatia to arm its previously poorly equipped military and to equip new recruits.|$|E
