500|$|In late 2000, Kuntz {{decided not}} {{to return to his}} role as first-base coach and outfield instructor. Instead, {{he went back to his}} {{position}} as a roving instructor with the team, which allowed for more time to be spent with his family. At that time, Marlins players including Cliff Floyd and Mark Kotsay praised Kuntz for the amount of preparation that he put into his coaching. Kotsay gave Kuntz credit for the stolen bases he had accrued. Floyd said, [...] ""I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm telling you, he's meant everything. He tells me about every pitcher we're facing. He keeps me going when I'm down. You don't get <b>that</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> in this game. You're expected just to be strong, handle everything. But it ain't that easy sometimes. He's a players' man. He loves us." ...|$|E
500|$|The puppeteers' {{performances}} and the show's {{approach to teaching}} fundamental life skills have been praised by critics. Common Sense Media reviewer Andrea Graham gave the show a five-star review, writing that [...] "when it comes to preschool programming, Oobi really breaks the mold, succeeding in its simplicity." [...] The Coalition for Quality Children's Media wrote positively of Oobi, complimenting its concept and calling it [...] "thoroughly enjoyable" [...] and [...] "extremely well received." [...] Diana Dawson of the Herald-Journal found the show's old-fashioned look appealing, stating that [...] "in a world <b>that</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> forgets the innocent joy of playing kick-the-can and catching fireflies, there's something incredibly endearing about the bare-handed puppetry." [...] DVD Talk's Holly Ordway was unimpressed with the series' simplicity, but admitted in her review that it was [...] "a clever way to encourage kids to be imaginative." [...] Ryan Ball of Animation Magazine described the show as [...] "an offbeat new entry" [...] to Noggin's lineup, adding that [...] "the fact that all the characters are played by hands just adds to the quirkiness." [...] In 2010, Babble.com listed Oobi second on their list of top twelve television series for babies and toddlers.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the founder}} of Ethical Culture, Felix Adler, was a transcendentalist, Ethical Culturists may {{have a variety of}} {{understandings}} as to the theoretical origins of ethics.

2500|$|This view {{of culture}} {{has had a}} {{tremendous}} impact outside of anthropology, and dominated American anthropology until the Cold War, when anthropologists like Sidney Mintz and Eric Wolf rejected the validity and value of approaching [...] "each culture" [...] as [...] "a world in itself" [...] and [...] "relatively stable." [...] They felt <b>that,</b> <b>too</b> <b>often,</b> this approach ignored the impact of imperialism, colonialism, and the world capitalist economy on the peoples Benedict and her followers studied (and thus re-opened {{the debate on the}} relationship between the universal and the particular, {{in the form of the}} relationship between the global and the local). [...] In the meantime, its emphasis on metamorphosing patterns influenced French structuralism and made American anthropologists receptive to British structural-functionalism.|$|E

[...] According to Badu in an interview {{a few months after}} the album's release, [...] "it has sold 1.4 million in the US. So no, it didn't sell as much ... although creatively I feel like this is a better piece of work." [...] She felt disappointed at first about its commercial performance, but was encouraged by the response from listeners at her concerts: [...] "When I started to tour again and saw all the people show up who knew the words, it was confirmation that the work is not always for commercial success.

2500|$|Duncan Smith {{has said}} that tighter {{immigration}} controls are vital if Britain is to avoid [...] "losing another generation to dependency and hopelessness". In a speech delivered in Spain he said that only immigrants with [...] "something to offer" [...] should be allowed into the country and <b>that</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> foreign workers purporting to be skilled take low-skilled jobs that could be occupied by British school leavers. [...] According to The Daily Telegraphs analysis, the speech contained a warning to David Cameron [...] "that a 'slack' attitude to immigration {{will result in the}} Coalition repeating the mistakes made under Labour, when the vast majority of new jobs generated before the recession were taken by immigrants". Duncan Smith believes that some companies are using immigration as [...] "an excuse to import labour to take up posts which could be filled by people already in Britain". He says Britain needs an immigration system that gives the unemployed [...] "a level playing field". [...] "If we do not get this right then we risk leaving more British citizens out of work, and the most vulnerable group who will be the most affected are young people," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|DJBooth commented that, [...] "Purely as a rapper, Kid Ink doesn’t do much on My Own Lane {{to show us}} who {{he really}} is or what he’s capable of. Sure, his basic rhyme {{patterns}} and simple flows suffice over an outstanding beat or side-by-side with a quality hook, but his tone isn’t distinct and his lyrics {{do no more than}} fill the space between catchy hooks with words." [...] No Option" [...] is the album’s lyrical peak, but King Los' witty guest verses hardly make up for a lackluster musical foundation and a repetitive hook. [...] "More Than a King" [...] is easily the highlight of the album, and really its only true gem. The shifting instrumental, provided by Bay area upstart Ned Cameron, is downright filthy. Gravely vocal clips taken from an unidentified film dialogue precede each verse, punctuating the two-part beat rather nicely." [...] In a mixed review, Ken Capobianco writing for The Boston Globe said, [...] "The major label debut from LA’s Kid Ink finds the MC taking his own lane right into the pop mainstream and it’s not a smooth ride. Ink mostly relies on a nasal singsong flow <b>that,</b> <b>too</b> <b>often,</b> accidentally detours into monotony over slickly produced club beats borrowed from better sources. Hip-hop is so saturated with songs about women and partying, Ink’s additions to the hey-ho hedonism become wearying." ...|$|E

The great fault was, <b>that</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> incident to the gentleness of woman--a want of self-reliant principle. Her virtue was too much the result of mere sympathy, too little of her own conviction. Hence, when those she loved grew cold towards a good cause, they found no sustaining power in her, and those who were relying on her judgment and opinions insensibly controlled them. Notwithstanding, she was a woman that always acquired a great influence over young men, and Harry had loved and revered her with something of the same sentiment that he cherished towards his own mother.|$|E

The prisoners taken during the siege, and the people who came out and surrendered, were always treated with kindness, even when the Spaniards were maddened by the sight of the daily sacrifices of their countrymen by the Aztecs. Again and again, during the siege, Cortez endeavored to induce the enemy to come to terms; and after the fighting was over, the whole of the survivors were permitted to depart unharmed.|$|E
