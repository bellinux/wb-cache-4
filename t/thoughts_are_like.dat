60|$|A man cannot wheedle nor overawe his Genius. It {{requires}} to be conciliated by nobler conduct {{than the}} world demands or can appreciate. These winged <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> birds, {{and will not be}} handled; even hens will not let you touch them like quadrupeds. Nothing was ever so unfamiliar and startling to a man as his own thoughts.|$|E

6000|$|... 'My lad,' {{said the}} Captain, whose opinion of Mr Toots was much {{improved}} by this candid avowal, 'a man's <b>thoughts</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> the winds, and nobody can't answer for 'em for certain, {{any length of}} time together. Is it a treaty as to words?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} said that," [...] replied Helen, quickly. Just then Bo slipped {{close to}} her and gave her arm a little squeeze. Probably Bo's <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> hers--here <b>was</b> a real Western man. That was her first impression, and following swiftly upon it was a sensation of eased nerves.|$|R

60|$|But {{who put the}} {{thoughts}} of the excellencies {{of the things that}} are eternal--I say, who put {{the thoughts}} of the excellency of those things into thy mind in this wanton age?--in an age wherein the thoughts of eternal life, and the salvation of the soul, are with and to many like the Morocco ambassador and his men, men of strange faces, in strange habit, with strange gestures and behaviour, monsters to behold. But where hadst thou that heart that gives entertainment to these thoughts, these heavenly thoughts? These <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> the French Protestants, banished thence where they willingly would have harbour.35 How came they to thy house, to thy heart, and to find entertainment in thy sou1? The Lord keep them in every imagination of the thoughts of thy heart for ever, and incline thine heart to seek Him more and more.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{mind was}} strong of grasp and wide in range, but {{continuous}} effort [...] fatigued it. She could strike out isolated sentences alternately [...] brilliant, exhaustive, and profound, {{but she could}} not link them to [...] other sentences so as to form an organic whole. Her thought was [...] definite singly, but vague as a whole. She always saw things [...] separately, and tried to combine them arbitrarily, and it is generally [...] difficult to follow out any idea of hers from its origin to its end. [...] Her <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> pearls of price profusely scattered, or [...] carelessly strung together, but not set in any design. On closing one [...] of her books, the reader is left with no continuous impression. He [...] has been dazzled and delighted, enlightened also by flashes; but the [...] horizons disclosed have vanished again, and the outlook is enriched by [...] no new vistas.|$|E

3000|$|... “The {{stream of}} our <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> a river. On the whole, easy simple flowing predominates in it, the drift of things {{is with the}} pull of gravity, and {{effortless}} attention is the rule. But at intervals an obstruction, a set-back, a log-jam occurs, stops the current, creates an eddy, and makes things temporarily move the other way.” James (1890, p. 451).|$|R

The anatomist Richard Owen showed him that the fragments were from gigantic extinct glyptodons, related to the armadillos.

50|$|Much of {{the film}} is devoted to Matthew's inner thoughts, {{including}} his conversations and visits with Jesus. Matthew tells us at the film's beginning that his stream-of-consciousness <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> having a radio inside, with the dial being constantly tuned across the spectrum of available stations.|$|E
5000|$|... "You know, {{we had to}} {{deal with}} an {{extraordinarily}} gifted person. Once in my film [...] "The Rescuer" [...] was a line about the teacher: [...] "One persons <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> ripples on the water. He only needs to throw something, then you hear a small sound and then it creates ripples. And Matvey [...] "threw it" [...] exactly in the center, and it sent ripples. And I am amazed that they are still there" [...]|$|E

5000|$|Descartes often {{wrote of}} the meaning of idea as an image or representation, often but not {{necessarily}} [...] "in the mind", which was well known in the vernacular. Despite that Descartes is usually credited with the invention of the non-Platonic use of the term, he at first followed this vernacular use.b In his Meditations on First Philosophy he says, [...] "Some of my <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> images of things, and it is to these alone that the name 'idea' properly belongs." [...] He sometimes maintained that ideas were innate and uses of the term idea diverge from the original primary scholastic use. He provides multiple non-equivalent definitions of the term, uses it to refer to as many as six distinct kinds of entities, and divides ideas inconsistently into various genetic categories. For him knowledge took the form of ideas and philosophical investigation is the deep consideration of these entities.|$|E

50|$|Soon {{after the}} house was built the Cowpers planted a {{vineyard}} {{which was one of}} the earliest in the colony. By 1850 the Wivenhoe wines were becoming celebrated with several very favourable mentions in the newspapers. In 1856 one newspaper described the wines that were produced there. These were Muscat, Riesling and red wine which they said was similar to Rhine Valley wines and Madeira which they <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> Frontenac. In 1858 Conrad Martens sketched of the house. In 1866 Wivenhoe was advertised for sale and the property was described in the following terms.|$|R

60|$|When he saw {{and heard}} Bacon, his hurt pride flamed up in wrath, but the calm voice of Radbourn, {{and the look}} in his stern, accusing eyes, made his head fall in thought. As he rode, things grew clearer. As a matter of fact, his whole system of {{religious}} <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> the side of a shelving sand-bank--in unstable equilibrium--needing only a touch to send it slipping into a shapeless pile at the river's edge. That touch had been given, and he was now {{in the midst of the}} motion of his falling faith. He didn't know how much would stand when the sloughing ended.|$|R
60|$|The simple, logical {{interpretation}} of Wilson's words opened Columbine's mind to a disturbing possibility {{of which she}} had never dreamed. That he might love her!

The next throb of <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> a knock at a door of her heart--a door never yet opened, inside which seemed a mystery of feeling, of hope, despair, unknown longing, and clamorous voices. The woman just born in her, instinctive and self-preservative, shut that door before she had more than a glimpse inside. But then she felt her heart swell with its nameless burdens.|$|R
