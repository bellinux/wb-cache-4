5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> hatch, {{the birds}} will desert their nest. Even though the young can swim and dive during this time, they rarely do, instead {{staying on the}} parents' backs for four days after hatching. After about 10 days, the parents split <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> up, with each parent taking care of {{about half of the}} brood. After this split, <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> are {{independent}} in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.|$|E
5|$|Both species lay 3–5 {{normally}} whitish eggs blotched {{with brown}} or grey, which are incubated by the female alone. <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> hatch after {{two to three}} weeks. Red-billed chough chicks are almost naked, but <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> of the higher altitude Alpine chough hatch with a dense covering of natal down. <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> are fed by both parents and fledge in 29–31 days after hatching for Alpine chough, and 31–41days for red-billed.|$|E
5|$|A clutch {{consists}} of three to five light-blue eggs, and is incubated by the female alone. The eggs hatch after 14days, and <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> leave the nest a further two weeks later. The altricial chicks are naked and have their eyes closed {{for the first few}} days after hatching. While <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> are still young, the mother broods them continuously. When they are older, the mother will brood them only at night or during bad weather.|$|E
5000|$|Vent sexing, {{also known}} simply as venting, {{involves}} squeezing the feces out of <b>the</b> <b>chick,</b> which opens up <b>the</b> <b>chick's</b> anal vent (called a cloaca) slightly, allowing the chicken sexer to see if <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> has a small [...] "bump", which would indicate that <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> is a male. Some females also have bumps, though they are rarely as large as those of male chicks.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>chick</b> is brooded for 20 days by its parents, {{after which}} both parents leave the nest {{and return to}} feed <b>the</b> <b>chick.</b> <b>The</b> <b>chick</b> is fed regurgitated food by {{sticking}} its bill inside that of its parent. Fledging occurs after 140 days.|$|R
50|$|A Smurf {{reasons that}} <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> {{will become a}} hen and lay magic eggs. He thus sets to work {{building}} an enclosure for <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> to live in, feed and water it and keep the place tidy. After all his hard work however the Smurf is shattered when <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> grows up to become a non-egg laying rooster.|$|R
5|$|Born {{helpless}} {{and unable to}} move around (nidicolous and semi-altricial), <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> are constantly brooded by the parents until they are 3 to 5 days old, when they can thermoregulate their body temperature. They grow their first feathers—scapulars—at 13–15 days, followed by primaries at 24–27 days, tail feathers at 30–35 days and are fully feathered by 55 days. They are attended by the parents more between the 30th and 60th days; a behavior possibly related to the greater food requirements of <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> during those days. Semi-digested food is regurgitated and then fed to younger birds, with older birds being fed solid food. The parents {{can be seen at}} normal rates with <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> up to about the 70th day, after which the attendance by the parents falls rapidly. Chicks receive no care after fledging, with only about one out of seven chicks receiving food after the 80th day, and almost no chicks are visited after about 90 days. After fledging, <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> will leave the nest, with few remaining after about 100 days.|$|E
5|$|Lesser yellow-headed {{vultures}} do {{not build}} nests, but rather lay eggs on the ground, cliff ledges, the floors of caves, {{or in the}} hollow of a tree. Eggs are cream colored and heavily blotched with brown and gray spots, particularly around the larger end. Two eggs are generally laid. <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> are altricial—they are blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching. <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> do not grow their down feathers until later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> then drink it. Young fledge after two to three months.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> hatch 12–14days after {{incubation}} begins. Like all passerines, <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> are altricial; {{they are}} hatched naked, with reddish bodies, pale grey down, and closed eyes. The mother bird feeds her young regurgitated seeds and insects as they grow. The hatchlings develop quickly, opening their eyes after three days, and completing {{the growth of}} olive-brown juvenile plumage after 11–15days, at which time they begin to practice short flights close to the nest. For up to three weeks after fledging, they are still fed by the male, who locates them by listening for their fledging call. <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> stop giving this call when they become entirely independent.|$|E

5|$|Greater yellow-headed {{vultures}} do {{not build}} nests, but rather {{lay their eggs}} directly on cliffs, the floors of caves, the ground, or in the hollows of stumps. Eggs are cream-colored and blotched with brown spots, particularly around the larger end. Clutch size ranges from one to three, though two is the norm. <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> are altricial—blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching, and grow down feathers later.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> are fed by {{the parents}} for several days after fledging. The family may travel as a group or the parents may divide the brood, taking one or two chicks each.|$|E
5|$|The clutch is {{a single}} egg, usually pure white, {{sometimes}} with some reddish brown spots that soon disappear. The average size of the egg is , and it weighs , of which 6% is shell. If an egg is lost early enough, on rare occasions a replacement may be laid. This is very unusual for tubenoses. The eggs are incubated by both parents for 38–50days, the longer periods arising when the eggs have become chilled through adult absence. One adult typically spends three {{days at a time}} on the egg while its partner feeds at sea. <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> are altricial and covered with silver-grey down, and are fed by both parents with their regurgitated oily stomach contents. The adults do not normally stay with the chick after first week, visiting only to bring food. After about 50days, <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> are fed less regularly, sometimes with gaps of several days, and the parents may stop visiting completely shortly before the chick leaves the nest. <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> fledge about 56–86days after hatching, and receive no parental support after leaving the nest hole.|$|E

5|$|The female kakapo lays 1 or 2 eggs (rarely 3) per {{breeding}} cycle, {{with long}} intervals between laying of {{first and second}} eggs. She nests on the ground {{under the cover of}} plants or in cavities such as hollow tree trunks. The female incubates the eggs faithfully, but is forced to leave them every night in search of food. Predators are known to eat the eggs and the embryos inside can also die of cold in the mother's absence. Kakapo eggs usually hatch within 30days, bearing fluffy grey chicks that are quite helpless. After the eggs hatch, the female feeds <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> for three months, and <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> remain with the female for some months after fledging. The young chicks are just as vulnerable to predators as the eggs, and young have been killed by many of the same predators that attack adults. Chicks leave the nest at approximately 10 to 12weeks of age. As they gain greater independence, their mothers may feed <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> sporadically for up to 6months.|$|E
5|$|When hatched, <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> are downy. Neither altricial nor precocial, <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> {{begin to}} move around and explore their {{surroundings}} within one to three days after hatching. Usually they do not stray far from the nest. Chicks are brooded by the adults for the first ten days after hatching. Both parents care for hatchlings. Chick diets always include fish, and parents selectively bring larger prey items to chicks than they eat themselves. Males bring more food than females. Feeding by the parents lasts for roughly a month before being weaned off slowly. After fledging, the juveniles learn to feed themselves, including the difficult method of plunge-diving. They will fly south to winter {{with the help of}} their parents.|$|E
5|$|About 45–50 {{days after}} hatching, <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> form a crèche, huddling {{together}} for warmth and protection. During this time, both parents forage at sea and return periodically {{to feed their}} chicks. A crèche may comprise up to several thousand birds densely packed together and is essential for surviving the low Antarctic temperatures.|$|E

50|$|The {{blue-footed booby}} brood of two chicks {{always has a}} {{dominance}} hierarchy due to the asynchronous hatching of the eggs. One egg is laid {{four days before the}} other, and incubation starts immediately after laying, so <b>the</b> elder <b>chick</b> is hatched four days before <b>the</b> younger <b>chick</b> and has a four-day head start on growth. <b>The</b> elder, stronger <b>chick</b> almost always becomes <b>the</b> dominant <b>chick.</b> During times of food shortage, <b>the</b> dominant <b>chick</b> often kills <b>the</b> subordinate <b>chick</b> by either repeatedly pecking or by ousting <b>the</b> younger <b>chick</b> from <b>the</b> nest. The brood hierarchy makes it easier for <b>the</b> subordinate <b>chick</b> to die quietly in times of food scarcity, which provides an efficient system for booby parents to maximize their investment.|$|R

5|$|Adults {{have a full}} moult after breeding, {{beginning}} between late May {{and the end of}} June, {{and completed}} by early October.

5|$|Although their ranges overlap substantially, {{hybridisation}} between goldcrests and firecrests {{seems to}} be prevented by differences in courtship rituals and different facial patterns. Even in aviary studies in which a female goldcrest was given an artificial eyestripe to facilitate mating with a male firecrest, <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> were never raised by the mixed pair, {{and appeared to be}} poorly adapted compared to the parent species.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} swallows, pairing and {{copulation}} displays are normally brief, taking {{just a few}} minutes. The male calls to a female and attempts to lead her to the nest, where he lands and continues calling while posing with lowered head, dropped wings and ruffled throat. If he is successful, the female calls and allows him to mount her, usually in the nest. Three or four white eggs are the normal clutch and all three species are frequently double-brooded. Both sexes build the nest, incubate the eggs and feed <b>the</b> <b>chicks,</b> although the female {{does most of the}} incubation, which normally lasts 14–16 days. The newly hatched chicks are altricial, and after a further 22–32 days, depending on weather, <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> leave the nest. The fledged young stay with, and are fed by, the parents for about a week after leaving the nest. Occasionally, young birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood.|$|E
