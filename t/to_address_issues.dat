5|$|After the article's publication, the Church of Scientology {{mounted a}} public {{relations}} campaign <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>issues</b> in the piece. It took out advertisements in USA Today for twelve weeks, and Church leader David Miscavige was interviewed by Ted Koppel on Nightline about what he {{considered to be an}} objective bias by the article's author. Miscavige alleged that the article was actually driven by the company Eli Lilly, because of Scientology's efforts against the drug Prozac. The Church of Scientology brought a libel suit against Time Warner and Behar, and sued Reader's Digest in multiple countries in Europe in an attempt to stop the article's publication there. The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Concept {{work for}} Xenosaga Episode III began during the later {{development}} of Xenosaga Episode II in 2004. The development team's aim was <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>issues</b> raised by fans and staff {{with the previous}} two Xenosaga games, along with bringing the story to a satisfactory conclusion. Due to the decision to turn the intended six-part series into a trilogy, the original draft for Episode III was substantially reworked. As with previous Xenosaga titles, the subtitle was drawn {{from the work of}} German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. While the game was praised by critics and went on to sell over 340,000 copies worldwide, the mixed response to the Xenosaga series as a whole left Monolith Soft staff in a state of low morale, partially leading to the development of Xenoblade Chronicles.|$|E

5|$|In March 2016, the ICAO adopted several {{amendments}} to the Chicago Convention <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>issues</b> raised by Flight 370's disappearance. For aircraft manufactured after 2020, cockpit voice recorders {{will be required to}} record at least 25 hours of data, so that they record all phases of a flight. Aircraft designs approved after 2020 will need to have a means to recover the flight recorders, or the information they contain, before the recorders sink below water. This provision is performance-based {{so that it can be}} accomplished by different techniques, such as streaming flight recorder data from aircraft in distress or using flight recorders which eject from aircraft and float on the water's surface. The new regulations will not require modifications to existing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} bought by BSA in 1961 {{at a cost of}} £8.5million and became known in legal terms as BSA-Churchill Machine Tools Ltd. In October 1962 H G Sturgeon, OBE, {{previously}} managing director at de Havilland Aircraft, was appointed to the same position at Churchill; he moved on in 1964 to become managing director of the BSA group's Motorcycle division. In 1966 Churchill merged in a joint-venture agreement with Alfred Herbert and became part of Herbert-BSA Ltd, the intention being that the combined concerns would gain benefits from rationalisation and symbiosis of their activities. The general expectation – held also by the Department of Trade and Industry and the stock market – of rewards from the venture did not materialise and BSA sold its entire holding in August 1971, writing off £6.9M {{as a consequence of the}} need to have cash in hand <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>issues</b> elsewhere in its activities.|$|E
5|$|Based on his philanthropic worldview, Clinton {{created the}} William J. Clinton Foundation <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>issues</b> of global importance. This {{foundation}} includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, {{and has worked}} with the Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global public health, poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict. In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools. Clinton's foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative. The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East. In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30percent in developing nations. Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy, which was voted down.|$|E

5|$|Immortal Throne was {{announced}} by publisher THQ in November 2006, {{four months after}} the release of Titan Quest. The game went gold in February 2007. It released in North America and Europe on March 2, 2007. In Japan, it released on March 23. The game was released on Steam on July 17, 2007 alongside its predecessor by THQ. Immortal Throne was re-released as part of the Titan Quest gold edition: it released on October 22, 2007 in the West, and on April 25, 2008 in Japan. Since its release and the closure of Iron Lore, fan patches were created <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>issues</b> found within Immortal Throne such as bugs and multiplayer issues. The Titan Quest intellectual property was purchased by Nordic Games after THQ began selling off its shares in the wake of its 2013 bankruptcy. Beginning in 2016, Nordic Games began supporting the game's Steam version with patches to fix gameplay and multiplayer issues, along with glitches and bugs. Titan Quest was later ported to mobile devices in 2016 by DotEmu under supervision by Nordic Games: when asked whether Immortal Throne would also be released on the platforms, DotEmu stated that they were focusing on the main game and would hopefully port Immortal Throne at a later date.|$|E
5|$|Kaga {{designed}} Gaiden <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>issues</b> {{raised with}} the first game, such as tedious elements of map navigation. The system of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light was used as base for various improvements to aspects such as enemy AI, although the gameplay adjustments ended up removing some of the strategic elements. These elements included a navigable overworld and more overt role-playing elements, along {{with the introduction of}} the class evolution system. Balancing these elements proved challenging for the team. The game made use of the new MMC4 memory chip, developed partially in response to the memory capacity problems faced during the development of the first game. For the story, Kaga wanted to deepen the relationship between the player and their units, represented through the growth of the characters through their battles. To create a stronger and broader central narrative, Kaga created the game's dual protagonists. An overt reference to Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light was made {{in the form of a}} trio of female Pegasus Knights, who were similar to another trio from the first game yet bore different names.|$|E
5|$|In 1777, Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc {{introduced}} the Supremum Justitiæ Magistratum (Collegiate Tribunal of the Jury's Supreme Magistrate) {{in order to}} establish more separation of powers in judicial decisions. Giandonato Rogadeo, an eminent European jurist, was requested to come to Malta in 1781 by de Rohan <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>issues</b> related to common law. Rogadeo went on to author the Diritto Municipale, between the year of his arrival and 1784, a law book to be used for the Castellania. During his stay in Malta, he further observed that it was not the law which was just problematic but also the judges and advocates which were corrupt. His work was opposed by the advocates and judges, with Baron Gaetano Pisani and Judge Gio Nicoló Muscat anonymously publishing works in Rome in 1783 to challenge it and aiming to keep the status quo which had limited considerations. It became the primarily Maltese law of the Code de Rohan, a humane set of laws, which brought significant reformation to criminal law. The Code incorporated previous laws introduced from former Grand Masters with a more liberal approach. It also set standard regulations for advocates, with some flexibility. It was subsequently amended with the use of bandi. The Diritto Municipale was abolished in 1854, during the British period, and replaced by a more lenient Criminal Code.|$|E
