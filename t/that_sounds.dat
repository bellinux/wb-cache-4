5|$|Right before Van Halen's guitar solo begins, a {{noise is}} heard <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> like {{somebody}} knocking at a door. It is {{reported that the}} knock was a person walking into Eddie's recording studio. Another story has claimed that the sound was simply the musician knocking on his own guitar.|$|E

5|$|Nearly all soprano and piccolo {{clarinets}} have keywork {{enabling them}} to play the E below middle C as their lowest written note (in scientific pitch notation <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> D3 on a soprano clarinet or C4, i.e. concert middle C, on a piccolo clarinet), though some B clarinets go down to E3 {{to enable them to}} match the range of the A clarinet. On the B soprano clarinet, the concert pitch of the lowest note is D3, a whole tone lower than the written pitch.|$|E
5|$|Special unpitched stops {{also appear}} in some organs. Among {{these are the}} Zimbelstern (a wheel of {{rotating}} bells), the nightingale (a pipe submerged in a small pool of water, creating {{the sound of a}} bird warbling when wind is admitted), and the effet d'orage ("thunder effect", a device <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> the lowest bass pipes simultaneously). Standard orchestral percussion instruments such as the drum, chimes, celesta, and harp have also been imitated in organ building.|$|E
5|$|A noisy species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically {{similar to that of}} the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy and can also sound like breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> like a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E

5|$|In a B plot, Andy (Chris Pratt) {{is doing}} well in his new job as the Pawnee shoeshiner, and Ron pays for a shine. Ron is {{impressed}} when Andy actually eases the pain from his bunion, and he later purposely scuffs his shoe {{so he can get}} a second shine. Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine. This time, Ron makes an involuntary noise <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> like a sexual moan, seriously embarrassing both men. After a day of avoiding each other, Ron and Andy discuss the noise and decide {{it would be best to}} simply pretend it never happened.|$|E
5|$|India's first {{records of}} {{smallpox}} {{can be found}} in a medical book that dates back to A.D. 400. This book describes a disease <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> exceptionally like smallpox. India, like China, created a goddess in response to its exposure to smallpox. The Hindu goddess Shitala was both worshipped and feared during her reign. It was believed that this goddess was both evil and kind and had the ability to inflict victims when angered, as well as calm the fevers of the already afflicted. Portraits of the goddess show her holding a broom in her right hand to continue to move the disease and a pot of cool water in the other hand in an attempt to soothe victims. Shrines were created where many India natives, both healthy and not, went to worship and attempt to protect themselves from this disease. Some Indian women, in an attempt to ward off Shitala, placed plates of cooling foods and pots of water on the roofs of their homes.|$|E
25|$|Varsovians still {{commonly}} use nicknames {{to refer}} to the palace, notably Pekin ("Beijing", because of its abbreviated name PKiN), and Pajac ("clown", a word <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> close to Pałac).

50|$|During {{the memory}} span experiment, each subject is {{presented}} with a sequence of stimuli of the same kind; words depicting objects, numbers, letters <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> similar, and letters <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> dissimilar. After being presented with the stimuli, the subject is asked to recall the sequence of stimuli that they were given in the exact order {{in which it was}} given. In one particular version of the experiment, if the subject recalled a list correctly, the list length increased by one for that type of material, and vice versa if it was recalled incorrectly. The theory is that people have a memory span of about seven items for numbers, the same for letters <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> dissimilar and short words. The memory span is projected to be shorter with letters <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> similar and longer words.|$|R

25|$|The R44 was {{the first}} car since the BMT Green Hornet to {{incorporate}} a two-note warning tone, the first two notes of Westminster Quarters, <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> before the doors begin to close as the train prepares to leave the station. When the cars were built, the chime was sounded four seconds before the doors closed, but the time delay was later removed. This has become the signature sound of the subway and is used with all subsequent cars.|$|E

25|$|A PSK31 {{operator}} typically uses a single-sideband (SSB) transceiver {{connected to}} the sound card of a computer running PSK31 software. When the operator enters a message for transmission, the software produces an audio tone <b>that</b> <b>sounds,</b> to the human ear, like a continuous whistle with a slight warble. This sound is then fed through either a microphone jack (using an intermediate resistive attenuator to reduce the sound card's output power to microphone levels) or an auxiliary connection into the transceiver, from which it is transmitted.|$|E
25|$|The yellow {{plastic pipe}} is {{actually}} a child’s toy <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> when the pipe is whirled around. The metal pipe shown {{was used in the}} Concorde cockpit to provide cooling air to the pilots, but its loud tone got it canceled. This whistle is similar in many respects to the hole tone, in particular the teapot whistle. It is subject to frequency jumps and hysteresis loops. There are numerous articles on the internet about this whistle and it has been studied.|$|E
25|$|Gale McGee was not {{the first}} senator to propose a summer break. In 1959 Margaret Chase Smith warned of the Senate’s {{increasing}} workload. It creates disorder, she complained, as well as “confused thinking, harmful emotions, destructive tempers, unsound and unwise legislation, and ill health with the very specter of death hanging over Members of Congress.” If <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> dramatic, keep in mind that in the 1950s senators died in office {{at a rate of about}} two per year. Smith proposed an annual break from August to October, but the Senate ignored her words of caution.|$|E

25|$|It is {{the form}} that allows a writer the {{greatest}} opportunity to explore human experience....For that reason, reading a novel is potentially a significant act. Because {{there are so many}} varieties of human experience, so many kinds of interaction between humans, and so many ways of creating patterns in the novel that can’t be created in a short story, a play, a poem or a movie. The novel, simply, offers more opportunities for a reader to understand the world better, including the world of artistic creation. <b>That</b> <b>sounds</b> pretty grand, but I think it’s true.|$|E
25|$|Stereotypical pirate accents are {{modeled on}} those of Cornwall, South Devon or the Bristol Channel area in South West England, though {{they can also}} be based on Elizabethan era English or other parts of the world. Pirates in film, {{television}} and theatre are generally depicted as speaking English in a particular accent and speech pattern <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> like a stylized West Country accent, exemplified by Robert Newton's performance as Long John Silver in the 1950 film Treasure Island. A native of the West Country in south west England from where many famous English pirates hailed, Newton also used the same strong West Country accent in Blackbeard the Pirate (1952).|$|E
25|$|A {{very rare}} form {{includes}} the diaphragmatic flutter, the Belly Dancer's Syndrome, or Van Leeuwenhoek's disease. It was first described by Antony van Leeuwenhoek in 1723, {{who suffered from}} it. The condition characterizes spoken communication <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> like a short-breathed hiccup. These muscle spasms can recur dozens of times per day. Rate of diaphragmatic contraction ranges between 35 and 480 contractions per minute, with the average rate found to be 150. Studies show that possible causes include disruptions within the central or peripheral nervous systems, anxiety, nutritional disorder, and certain pharmaceuticals. No single treatment has proven effective, though blocking or crushing of the phrenic nerve can provide instantaneous relief when pharmacologic treatment has proven ineffective.|$|E
