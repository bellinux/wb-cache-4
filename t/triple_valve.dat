25|$|In {{order to}} design a system without the {{shortcomings}} of the straight air system, Westinghouse invented a system wherein each piece of railroad rolling stock was equipped with an air reservoir and a <b>triple</b> <b>valve,</b> {{also known as a}} control valve.|$|E
40|$|A <b>triple</b> duty <b>valve</b> is used {{to control}} the {{functions}} such as on-off, throttling and non-return on the discharge side of hydronic pump systems. In this paper, computational fluid dynamic techniques are used to simulate the 2 inch <b>triple</b> duty <b>valve</b> performance characteristics for various stroke lengths with uniform outgoing velocity. The performance characteristics such as flow coefficient and pressure loss coefficient for <b>triple</b> duty <b>valve</b> are calculated for different stroke lengths (8 mm, 12 mm and 20 mm) through simulation. Numerical simulation is conducted to study effect of various Reynolds number and valve openings on the performance characteristics of <b>triple</b> duty <b>valve.</b> The permanent pressure loss coefficient and its dependence on Reynolds number is computed and analyzed respectively so that the recovery of pressure after passage through valve could be quantitatively understood. The comparison of flow pattern at different stroke length is investigated. Pressure drop across the <b>triple</b> duty <b>valve</b> and formation of vortex flow after the valve section have been discussed. Magnitude of flow coefficient, pressure loss coefficient and permanent pressure loss coefficient calculated through numerical analysis are compared with the experimental results. Furthermore, this study {{can be used for}} the evaluation of performance characteristics of <b>triple</b> duty <b>valve</b> at different sizes...|$|R
5000|$|The Westinghouse {{air brake}} system. In this system, air {{reservoirs}} are provided on every vehicle and the locomotive charges the train pipe {{with a positive}} air pressure, which releases the vehicle brakes and charges the air reservoirs on the vehicles. If the driver applies the brakes, his brake valve releases air from the train pipe, and <b>triple</b> <b>valves</b> at each vehicle detect the pressure loss and admit air from the air reservoirs to brake cylinders, applying the brakes. The Westinghouse system uses smaller air reservoirs and brake cylinders than the corresponding vacuum equipment, because a moderately high air pressure can be used. However, an air compressor is required to generate the compressed air and in the earlier days of railways, this required a large reciprocating steam air compressor, and this was regarded by many engineers as highly undesirable.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the cars}} are fitted with K-1 and K-2 <b>triple</b> <b>valves</b> with {{retainers}}, the retainers are always set for the full release position. Brake pipe pressure is set to 70 lbs. fully charged and controlling speed with needed reductions as the grade and load require. The light weight of the cars is accentuated when the train is full vs. empty, making {{a big difference in}} how the engineer will handle the train on the return. While riding the train, you will likely hear the hiss of air being released from the brake cylinders as the train goes into the long horseshoe curve, where the grade is flat enough to maintain speed and recharge the brake pipe at the same time. As the engine nears the end of the curve, another set is generally made progressively and will be maintained until the Thunderhead Gap bridge, where the process is repeated and the final application is made for the descent into the lower loop. Once on the lower loop, the train drifts past the engine house and pulls the light grade back into the station.|$|R
25|$|When {{the engine}} {{operator}} applies the brake by operating the locomotive brake valve, the train line vents to atmosphere at a controlled rate, reducing the train line pressure {{and in turn}} triggering the <b>triple</b> <b>valve</b> on each car to feed air into its brake cylinder. When the engine operator releases the brake, the locomotive brake valve portal to atmosphere is closed, allowing the train line to be recharged by the compressor of the locomotive. The subsequent increase of train line pressure causes the triple valves on each car to discharge {{the contents of the}} brake cylinder to the atmosphere, releasing the brakes and recharging the reservoirs.|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} of a loss of braking due to {{reservoir}} depletion, the engine driver may be able to regain control with an emergency brake application, as the emergency portion of each car's dual-compartment reservoir should be fully chargedit is not affected by normal service reductions. The triple valves detect an emergency reduction based on the rate of brake pipe pressure reduction. Therefore, as long as a sufficient volume of air can be rapidly vented from the brake pipe, each car's <b>triple</b> <b>valve</b> will cause an emergency brake application. However, if the brake pipe pressure is too low due to an excessive number of brake applications, an emergency application will not produce a large enough volume of air flow to trip the triple valves, leaving the engine driver with no means to stop the train.|$|E
25|$|The <b>triple</b> <b>valve</b> is {{described}} as being so named as it performs three functions: Charging air into an air tank ready to be used, applying the brakes, and releasing them. In so doing, it supports certain other actions (i.e. it 'holds' or maintains the application and it permits the exhaust of brake cylinder pressure and the recharging of the reservoir during the release). In his patent application, Westinghouse refers to his 'triple-valve device' because of the three component valvular parts comprising it: the diaphragm-operated poppet valve feeding reservoir air to the brake cylinder, the reservoir charging valve, and the brake cylinder release valve. When he soon improved the device by removing the poppet valve action, these three components became the piston valve, the slide valve, and the graduating valve.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{safeguards}} that are usually taken to prevent this sort of accident happening. Railroads have strict government-approved procedures for testing the air brake systems when making up trains in a yard or picking up cars en route. These generally involve connecting the air brake hoses, charging up the brake system, setting the brakes and manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are applied, and then releasing the brakes and manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are released. Particular attention is usually paid to the rearmost car of the train, either by manual inspection or via an automated end-of-train device, to ensure that brake pipe continuity exists throughout the entire train. When brake pipe continuity exists throughout the train, failure of the brakes to apply or release on one or more cars is an indication that the cars' <b>triple</b> <b>valves</b> are malfunctioning. Depending on the location of the air test, the repair facilities available, and regulations governing the number of inoperative brakes permitted in a train, the car may be set out for repair or taken to the next terminal where it can be repaired.|$|R
5000|$|However, on {{units with}} <b>Triple</b> <b>Valves</b> (Distributore tipo Westinghouse) and 7-position levers, braking circuit is {{slightly}} different. The [...] is divided {{in two parts}} like said before, but there isn't the command reservoir tank: when the pressure inside the brake pipe drops, it's directly the auxiliary reservoir that makes the frame put in the middle moving. Braking is not gradual on release in this case: when the driver puts the controller on [...] "release" [...] position, brakes are fully released; if he brakes again too shortly after, there is the risk to have a loss of braking power because {{there may not be}} enough air to brake optimally, since the absence of the fixed pressure of the command reservoir doesn't ensure that there is enough air to safely release the brakes. It is even possible to fully exhaust the reservoir, with the consequent danger to not be able to stop the train at all. This is prevented in units with Breda and other types of valves as the brakes cannot be fully released if there is not enough air in main reservoir tanks to brake again.|$|R
50|$|There are {{different}} kinds of butterfly valves, each adapted for different pressures and different usage. The zero-offset butterfly valve, which uses the flexibility of rubber, has the lowest pressure rating. The high-performance double offset butterfly valve, used in slightly higher-pressure systems, is offset from the centre line of the disc seat and body seal (offset one), and the centre line of the bore (offset two). This creates a cam action during operation to lift the seat out of the seal resulting in less friction than is created in the zero offset design and decreases its tendency to wear. The valve best suited for high-pressure systems is the <b>triple</b> offset butterfly <b>valve.</b> In this valve the disc seat contact axis is offset, which acts to virtually eliminate sliding contact between disc and seat. In the case of <b>triple</b> offset <b>valves</b> the seat is made of metal {{so that it can}} be machined such as to achieve a bubble tight shut-off when in contact with the disc.|$|R
25|$|The {{emergency}} {{portion of}} each <b>triple</b> <b>valve</b> is activated by the extremely rapid rate of reduction of train line pressure. Due {{to the length}} of trains and the small diameter of the train line, the rate of reduction is high near the front of the train (in the case of an engine operator-initiated emergency application) or near the break in the train line (in the case of the train line coming apart). Farther away from the source of the emergency application, the rate of reduction can be reduced to the point where triple valves will not detect the application as an emergency reduction. To prevent this, each triple valve's emergency portion contains an auxiliary vent port, which, when activated by an emergency application, also locally vents the train line's pressure directly to atmosphere. This serves to propagate the emergency application rapidly along {{the entire length of the}} train.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, an {{emergency}} application brings in an additional component of each car's air brake system: the emergency portion. The <b>triple</b> <b>valve</b> {{is divided into}} two portions: the service portion, which contains the mechanism used during brake applications made during service reductions, and the emergency portion, which senses the immediate, rapid release of train line pressure. In addition, each car's air brake reservoir {{is divided into two}} portions—the service portion and the emergency portion—and is known as the [...] "dual-compartment reservoir”. Normal service applications transfer air pressure from the service portion to the brake cylinder, while emergency applications cause the <b>triple</b> <b>valve</b> to direct all air in both the service portion and the emergency portion of the dual-compartment reservoir to the brake cylinder, resulting in a 20–30% stronger application.|$|E
2500|$|The modern {{air brake}} is not {{identical}} {{with the original}} airbrake as there have been slight changes {{in the design of}} the <b>triple</b> <b>valve,</b> which are not completely compatible between versions, and which must therefore be introduced in phases. [...] However, the basic air brakes used on railways worldwide are remarkably compatible.|$|E
40|$|Brake {{propagation}} is slow {{for long}} freight trains that use a conventional air brake system. If {{the train is}} too long then the brake application will not propagate throughout the whole train. Brake propagation {{is one of the}} factors that limit the length of current heavy haul freight trains using a conventional air brake system. It is possible that a relatively simple modification to every wagon's brake valve could be done to ensure the brake signal is relayed throughout the train irrespective of the length of the train. The modification effectively increases the quick service volume or 'bulb' on Westinghouse style <b>triple</b> <b>valves</b> by connecting an additional volume and valve to the brake pipe. As each wagon's brakes apply, extra air will be taken from the brake pipe to fill the additional volume and thus ensuring the propagation of the brake signal {{to the rear of the}} train. The modification also has the advantage of reducing the time for the brakes to reach their final pressure, which reduces the train's stopping distance. A computer model of a complete train air brake system developed through the Rail CRC is used to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the modification. Using air brake equipment at CQU, experimental tests have been conducted to determine the allowable size of the additional volume and show the stability of the modification...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims. Treatment of hepatic {{hydrothorax}} is {{a clinical}} challenge. Chest tube insertion for hepatic hydrothorax {{is associated with}} high complication rates. We assessed the use of pigtail catheter as a safe and practical method for treatment of recurrent hepatic hydrothorax as {{it had not been}} assessed before in a large series of patients. Methods. This study was conducted on 60 patients admitted to Tanta University Hospital, Egypt, suffering from recurrent hepatic hydrothorax. The site of pigtail catheter insertion was determined by ultrasound guidance under complete aseptic measures and proper local anesthesia. Insertion was done by pushing the trocar and catheter until reaching the pleural cavity and then the trocar was withdrawn gradually while inserting the catheter which was then connected to a collecting bag via a <b>triple</b> way <b>valve.</b> Results. The use of pigtail catheter was successful in pleural drainage in 48 (80 %) patients with hepatic hydrothorax. Complications were few and included pain at the site of insertion in 12 (20 %) patients, blockage of the catheter in only 2 (3. 3 %) patients, and rapid reaccumulation of fluid in 12 (20 %) patients. Pleurodesis was performed on 38 patients with no recurrence of fluid within three months of observation. Conclusions. Pigtail catheter insertion is a practical method for treatment of recurrent hepatic hydrothorax with a low rate of complications.

40|$|AbstractCoexisting {{coronary}} artery disease and significant heart valve disease represent a considerable risk factor in patients undergoing pulmonary resection. The possibility to perform concomitant (simultaneous) heart and lung surgery {{could be a good}} option for many patients. In the presented case report, the intervention was performed on two <b>valves,</b> <b>triple</b> {{coronary artery}} bypass and pulmonary resection, which has not been published in literature to date. A 68 -year-old woman with {{coronary artery disease}}, aortic valve stenosis, tricuspid valve regurgitation and pulmonary disease (malignant pathology) presented with triple vessel disease, moderate aortic valve stenosis, severe tricuspid regurgitation and tumorous infiltration in the upper lobe of the left lung. She underwent combined heart and pulmonary surgery-left upper lobectomy, aortic valve replacement, tricuspid valve repair and coronary artery bypass surgery. On the eight day of surgery, she was discharged. She continues to do well on follow-up. Simultaneous cardiac surgery and pulmonary resection for malignancy become almost standard treatment of patients who require heart and lung surgery. The most often approach is midline sternotomy that enables a comfortable cardiac intervention as well as an acceptable access to lungs. The left lower lobectomy remains an exception, in which pulmonary resection during extracorporeal circulation (ECC) is more often an option of left thoracotomy. If the use of ECC is inevitable, some authors prefer pulmonary resection before starting up ECC if the location of the neoplasm does not require resection during ECC...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveLittle {{information}} is available about surgical outcomes in patients with multivalvular endocarditis. The aim {{of this article is}} to review the 21 -year experience with surgical treatment of patients with multivalvular endocarditis at our institution and, in particular, to determine the incidence, pathologic status, diagnosis, surgical strategies, and outcomes of patients with this disease. MethodsFrom January 1986 to December 2006, a total of 48 patients (40 men, 8 women), with a mean age of 42 ± 12 years, underwent surgery for multivalvular endocarditis. Endocarditis was active in 32 patients and healed in 16. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiographic evaluation was performed in all 48 patients with addition of transesophageal echocardiography in 22 (45. 8 %). Intraoperative findings showed that the endocarditis involved mostly the mitral and aortic valves (40 / 48 patients). <b>Triple</b> or quadruple <b>valve</b> involvement was found in 1 and 2 patients, respectively. Preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative data were retrospectively analyzed and risk factors for early and late survival were determined. ResultsIn only 24 (50. 0 %) patients was multivalvular endocarditis diagnosed by preoperative transthoracic echocardiography; 17 (77. 3 %) patients had multivalvular endocarditis confirmed by preoperative transesophageal echocardiography. The 30 -day hospital mortality was 12. 5 % (n = 6). Preoperative renal failure, New York Heart Association class IV, and emergency surgery were identified as independent risk factors for hospital mortality. Overall long-term survival was 74 % ± 6 % at 5 years and 62 % ± 3 % at 10 years. Multivariate analysis revealed that renal failure and recurrent endocarditis were associated with increased late mortality. Ten-year freedom from recurrent endocarditis was 74 % ± 5 % and 10 -year freedom from reoperation was 73 % ± 6 %. ConclusionsIn our institution, multivalvular endocarditis was diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiography in only half of the patients. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography provided a more effective means to identify this disease. Radical resection of all infected tissues for patients with multivalvular endocarditis and additional intraoperative interventions, depending on the intraoperative pathologic condition, produced satisfactory in-hospital and long-term results, similar to those in patients with a single infected heart valve...|$|R

The measuring tank is fitted with a ventilation stud, which vents displaced air as the tank is filled. The ventilation stud includes a ball cock fixed to a frustum stopper, which blocks the vent stud in case of accidental overfilling so that T-Stoff does not spray from the air vent.

50|$|In 1872, George Westinghouse {{invented the}} {{automatic}} air brake by inventing the <b>triple</b> <b>valve</b> and by equipping each car {{with its own}} air cylinder.

5000|$|In {{order to}} design a system without the {{shortcomings}} of the straight air system, Westinghouse invented a system wherein each piece of railroad rolling stock was equipped with an air reservoir and a <b>triple</b> <b>valve,</b> {{also known as a}} control valve.

50|$|Although {{the plain}} {{automatic}} air brake {{was a great}} improvement over the straight air brake, in an emergency the system still applied the brakes to the last cars in a train later than to the first cars in a train. To remedy that condition, George Westinghouse invented the quick action <b>triple</b> <b>valve</b> in 1887. It automatically vents air from the brake pipe locally on each car, which applies the brakes more quickly.|$|E
