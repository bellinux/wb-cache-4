30|$|Previous {{approaches}} for rendering typography to auditory modality {{can be characterized}} as direct mapping methodologies. Most of them are based on the relation similarity, i.e., each <b>typographic</b> <b>attribute</b> is directly mapped into a respective acoustic cue. The principle of relational similarity explores two physical quantities with magnitudes that humans perceive by different senses in an analogous way. For example, the font size of a text and the volume of the speech signal when the text is vocalized comprise relational similarity in the case we perceive the change of their magnitudes in a proportional way. In previous studies, the bold <b>typographic</b> <b>attribute</b> is rendered with: verbal description (the phrase “in bold” is said before the salient word with a 15  % decrease of the current pitch) [18], increase (13  %) of the default pitch for each pronounced salient word [18], a two-semitone decrease of pitch voice [19], slower speed for individual words [20], and a ring of a bell before a word with emphasis [21]. The italics <b>typographic</b> <b>attribute</b> is rendered either with a small change in the rhythm of speech [22] or by mixing a sound by 45  % to the right in stereo speakers [19].|$|E
30|$|There was no {{training}} session for the participants. Two sessions {{were designed for}} evaluating the acoustic renditions, the first for the font style and the second for the font size. Each acoustic stimulus was simultaneously presented with the corresponding visual version of the sentence in plain text. The {{participants were asked to}} identify which <b>typographic</b> <b>attribute</b> they believe is associated within the sentence they hear (possible answers for the font style: “bold, italics, bold-italics or none” and for the font size: “size increase, size decrease or none”).|$|E
30|$|In a {{previous}} study, Truillet et al. [18] {{present the results}} for the acoustic rendition of “bold” typesetting on salient words, in order to investigate the acoustic rendition of typesetting effect on memory, using verbal description of the <b>typographic</b> <b>attribute</b> or increasing the default pitch by 13  %, on both sighted and blind listeners (direct mapping). They observed no significant differences between groups’ memorization and between different versions of salient words’ expression. But, they present strong indications that the enriched version (verbalized description or prosodic differences while expressing the <b>typographic</b> <b>attribute)</b> has better performance than the neutral one, and the prosodic rendition has a better effect compared to the neutral and verbal description approach. Moreover, according to Asakawa et al. [21], the auditory interface of web pages, using two different ring tones to denote weak and strong emphasis level, is more useful for intuitive recognition. The emphasis level in the document was determined in [21] by the use of font size and style, giving priority to font size. For example, a part of text with much larger font sizes than the body of the main text is assigned to the strong emphasis and slightly larger size to weak emphasis level (indirect methodology using the semantics of typography of two different emphasis levels). Argyropoulos et al. [25] reported that blind student listeners have better performance under several conditions of typesetting acoustic rendition than their sighted peers. They used “bold” and “italics” and they assigned three different semantic conditions, “strong” for “bold”, “definition” and “emphasis” for “italics”. The three different conditions (along with an additional condition with no modifications) were acoustically rendered using the DEMOSTHeNES TtS system [13] and modifications of the pitch (main criterion), word rate, and speech volume. The way typographic cues were acoustically rendered was based on a literature survey and the experience of the research team. It is worth to note {{that in the case of}} sighted students, no condition was particularly more effective compared to any other condition and also the profile of the sighted group with regard to the prosody effects was “flat”, or otherwise unaffected by the condition variable.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} {{research}} {{for the design of}} “sound fonts ” and development of an evaluation methodology suitable for use with non visual presentation based on the speech modality or on multimodality (speech and tactile). The work hypothesis of the study presented here relies on the fact that both structure and <b>typographic</b> <b>attributes</b> increase the comprehension process in visual presentation. Based on this constant, the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) question is to find alternative sounds or prosodic variants to display the <b>typographic</b> <b>attributes</b> –bold, italic–, for instance. This question takes part of the paradigm of the information accessibility problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{rich history}} of {{cartography}} and typography indicates that <b>typographic</b> <b>attributes,</b> such as bold, italic and size, {{can be used}} to represent data in labels on thematic maps. These <b>typographic</b> <b>attributes</b> are itemized and characterized for encoding literal, categorical and quantitative data. Label-based thematic maps are shown, including examples that scale to multiple data attributes and a large number of entities. Multiple approaches to handle long labels are considered. Positional and proportional encoding apply attributes to portions of labels for encoding a large number of data attributes or quantitative values. Quantitative evaluation indicates label-based thematic maps may outperform choropleth maps for some tasks. Qualitative evaluation provides guidance for design considerations...|$|R
30|$|Through {{a number}} of psychoacoustic {{manipulations}} (pitch, volume, and speed variations of synthetic speech), Argyropoulos et al. [25] examined their effectiveness for the understanding of specific information (<b>typographic</b> <b>attributes</b> bold and italic) by 30 sighted and 30 blind participants. A preliminary study of auditory rendition of typographical and/or punctuation information, using expressive speech synthesis, is presented in [26]. The aim {{is to increase the}} expressiveness of the already existing TtS system of France Telecom using prosodic rules. Four prosodic parameters are proposed for use: pitch, rate, volume, and break.|$|R
30|$|In another future study, {{we intend}} to change the minimum {{perceived}} levels of pitch, rate and volume, in order to eliminate the pitfalls {{of the current study}} and to optimize listeners’ performance (e.g., the misunderstanding of bold-italics and bold during their acoustic rendition) or the use of non-linear quantization. Also, the study of acoustic rendition of <b>typographic</b> <b>attributes</b> in a similar methodology using discrete emotions (instead of the dimensional approach) seems very interesting. This would extend the use of the current methodology in systems than can process a reader’s discrete emotions derived from the typographic cues and the TtS systems that only support discrete emotion approach.|$|R
30|$|The above studies {{essentially}} propose {{rules for}} the implementation of the acoustic rendition of specific <b>typographic</b> <b>attributes.</b> It is obvious that a systematic methodology towards the acoustic rendition of typographic signals does not exist. The present work introduces the emotional-based mapping methodology for rendering font cues to auditory modality. The methodology is applied in a case study for font size and style. We determine the acoustic rendition of the font attributes by combining a text font-to-emotional state model and expressive speech synthesis. By conducting a number of psychoacoustic experiments, we determine the acoustic rendition of text font cues. Our ultimate goal is to incorporate automatic text font-to-speech mapping in DtA by emotional analogy between the visual (text font cues) and the acoustic (speech prosody) modalities.|$|R
30|$|Persons with print disabilities (i.e., {{individuals}} who cannot effectively read print {{because of a}} visual, physical, perceptual, developmental, cognitive, or learning disability [9, 10]), the elderly, as well the moving user, require printed or electronic documents in alternative formats, such as audio, braille or large print. Text-to-speech (TtS) is a common software technology that converts in real-time any electronic text into speech [11]. It can be combined with other assistive technology applications, such as screen readers, to provide document accessibility through the acoustic modality to those with print disability. Although TtS is considered a mature technology, current TtS systems do not include effective provision of the semantics and the cognitive aspects of the visual (e.g., <b>typographic</b> <b>attributes)</b> and non-visual (e.g., logical layer) text signals [12].|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} explores whether {{patterns of}} typographic differentiation influence readers’ impressions of documents. It develops a systematic approach to typographic investigation that considers relationships between {{different kinds of}} <b>typographic</b> <b>attributes,</b> rather than testing the influence of isolated variables. An exploratory study using multiple sort tasks and semantic differential scales identifies that readers form a variety of impressions in relation to how typographic elements are differentiated in document design. Building {{on the findings of}} the exploratory study and analysis of a sample of magazines, the research describes three patterns of typographic differentiation: high, moderate, and low. Each pattern comprises clusters of <b>typographic</b> <b>attributes</b> and organisational principles that are articulated in relation to a specified level of typographic differentiation (amplified, medium, or subtle). The patterns are applied to two sets of controlled test material. Using this purposely-designed material, the influence of patterns of typographic differentiation on readers’ impressions of documents is explored in a repertory grid analysis and a paired comparison procedure. The results of these studies indicate that patterns of typographic differentiation consistently shape readers’ impressions of documents, influencing judgments of credibility, document address, and intended readership; and suggesting particular kinds of engagement and genre associations. For example, high differentiation documents are likely to be considered casual, sensationalist, and young; moderate differentiation documents {{are most likely to be}} seen as formal and serious; and low differentiation examples are considered calm. Typographic meaning is shown to be created through complex, yet systematic, interrelationships rather than reduced to a linear model of increasing or decreasing variation. The research provides a way of describing typographic articulation that has application across a variety of disciplines and design practice. In particular, it illuminates the ways in which typographic presentation is meaningful to readers, providing knowledge that document producers can use to communicate more effectively...|$|R
40|$|Digital typefaces for {{computer}} graphics and multimedia applications must {{be capable of}} supporting operations such as font variations, transformations, deformations and blending. A powerful implementation of such operations must rely on the inherent <b>typographic</b> <b>attributes</b> of the typeface. However, even today's most advanced typeface representations support only geometric outline representations and basic font variations. In this paper we discuss high-level typeface representations which we term Parametric Typographic Representations (PTRs). We present an algorithm for automatically extracting typographic elements of typefaces from their outline representation, which is an essential initial step in converting typefaces from outline representations to PTRs. The extracted typographic elements include serifs, bars, stems, slants, bows, arcs, curve stems and curve bars. Most notable is the treatment of serifs, which are represented by finite-automata. The algorithm only needs to learn a ser [...] ...|$|R
30|$|Document {{structure}} {{affects the}} reading comprehension, browsing, and perceived control [35]. Hall and Hanna [36] examine {{the effect of}} web page text/background color combination on readability, retention, aesthetics, and behavioral intention. Ethier et al. [37] studied the impact of four websites’ interface features on the cognitive process that trigger online shoppers’ emotions. Focusing on the <b>typographic</b> <b>attributes</b> and using the dimensional theory of emotions, Laarni [38] investigated the effects of color, font type/style on the “Pleasure”, “Arousal”, and “Dominance” scales according to the users’ preferences. Furthermore, he examined the impact of color on document aesthetics (e.g., combinations of red font on green background were rated as the most unpleasant and black on white were considered the least arousing). Ho [39] in a review study on typography and emotions, concluded that most fonts and typefaces have a certain level of emotional potency. According to the experimental study of Koch [40], participants responded to typefaces with statistically significant levels of emotion. Ohene-Djan et al. [41, 42] studied how the text’s typographic elements can be used to convey emotions in subtitles mainly for the deaf and hearing-impaired people. They use font color and font size along with the emotions happily, sadly, sarcastically, excitedly, comically, fearfully, pleadingly, questioningly, authoritatively, and angrily. Using the TextTone system [43], emotions (e.g., happy, upset, disappointed, angry, very angry, ajd shocked) can be conveyed during online textual communication. This has been implemented by changing the <b>typographic</b> <b>attributes.</b> Moreover, Yannicopoulou [44] has examined the visual metaphor of emotions through the voice volume and letter size analogy. Based on the dimensional theory of emotions, a recent study [8] investigates how the typographic elements, like font style (bold, italics, and bold-italics) and font (type, size, color, and background color), affect the reader’s emotional states “Pleasure”, “Arousal”, and “Dominance” (PAD). Finally, the preliminary quantitative results of a regression model [17]: a) revealed the impact of font/background color brightness differences on readers’ emotional PAD space and b) showed that font type affects the “Arousal” and “Dominance” dimensions.|$|R
40|$|This study explores how the typographic {{layout of}} {{information}} influences readers' impressions of magazine contents pages. Thirteen descriptors {{were used in}} a paired comparison procedure that assessed whether participants' rhetorical impressions {{of a set of}} six controlled documents change in relation to variations in layout. The combinations of layout attributes tested were derived from the structural attributes associated with three patterns of typographic differentiation (high, moderate, and low) described in a previous study (see Moys, 2014). The content and the range of stylistic attributes applied to the test material were controlled in order to focus on layout attributes. Triangulation of the quantitative and qualitative data indicates that, even within the experimental confines of limited stylistic differentiation, the layout attributes associated with patterns of high, moderate, and low typographic differentiation do influence readers' rhetorical judgments. In addition, the findings emphasize the importance of considering inter-relationships between clusters of <b>typographic</b> <b>attributes</b> rather than testing isolated variables...|$|R
40|$|Document {{designers}} {{combine a}} range of stylistic and structural <b>typographic</b> <b>attributes</b> to articulate and differentiate information for readers. This paper explores how the kind of typographic differentiation used in a document influences readers’ impressions of documents. A preliminary study indicated that three patterns of typographic differentiation (high, moderate and low) might underlie participants’ impressions of magazine design. Subsequently, a set of nine magazine layouts with controlled content was purposefully developed to systematically {{examine the impact of}} high, moderate and low patterns of typographic differentiation on participants’ impressions of documents. These documents were used in a repertory grid procedure to investigate the kind of impressions readers articulate in relation to typographic presentation and whether readers are likely to formulate similar or differing impressions from high, moderate, and low patterns of typographic differentiation. The results suggest that typographic differentiation influences {{a range of}} rhetorical and experiential judgments. For example, participants described high differentiation documents as the most attention-grabbing and easy to skim-read, while they considered moderate and low differentiation documents to require deeper reading strategies. In addition, participants assumed high differentiation documents to be much more sensationalist than moderate or low differentiation documents, which they generally perceived as authoritative and credible...|$|R
30|$|Written {{document}}s, either printed or electronic, include books, journals, newspapers, newsletters, gazettes, reports, letters, e-mails, and webpages. According to McLuhan, {{a document}} is the “medium” {{in which a}} “message” (information) is communicated [1]. With the term text document, we refer to the textual content only of a document. A text document contains a number of presentation elements or attributes that arrange the content on the page and apply design glyphs or typographic elements (i.e., visual representation of letters and characters in a specific font and style). For example, {{the title of a}} chapter can be recognized as a sentence or phrase placed {{at the top of the}} page and in larger font size than the body of the text. Moreover, text color or the bold font style can be used to indicate emphasis in a specific part of a text document. In general, <b>typographic</b> <b>attributes</b> or cues constitute features of text documents, including typeface choice, size, color, and font style. Lorch [2] introduced the term “signal” as the “writing device that emphasizes aspects of a text’s content or structure without adding to the content of the text”. Text signals “attempt to pre-announce or emphasize a specific part of a document and/or reveal content relationship” [3, 4]. Headings or titles in text documents are considered as signals [5]. Moreover, “input enhancement” is an operation whereby the saliency of linguistic features is augmented through textual enhancement for visual input (i.e., bold) and phonological manipulations for aural input (i.e., oral repetition) [6]. Typographical elements can be conceptualized as semiotic resources for authors, illustrators, publishers, book designers, and readers to draw upon to realize textual or expressive meanings in addition to interpersonal and ideational meanings [7].|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores how {{the pure}} form of static {{typography}} can express the emotive qualities of music. More specifically, how typefaces/letterforms and typographic compositions can produce emotive associations; and whether combining both aspects {{can enhance the}} emotive value. Emotion, typography and music are the three core subject areas of this research. Using music as the medium to elicit emotions, {{the findings from this}} thesis indicate that typeface/letterform is the most effective aspect of static typography to express emotive qualities, followed by the combination of both typographic aspects, and typographic composition which has the least impact for emotive connections. Five influential factors affecting the process of emotive association between music and static typography has been found: 1) Association of <b>typographic</b> <b>attributes</b> and design principles to emotive qualities, 2) Direct association using emotive terms and adjectives, 3) Connotation through personal memory and imagination, 4) Association to human voice and human touch, and 5) Association to phonetic properties of music. Chapter 2 of this thesis presents {{a review of the literature}} from the three main subject areas. It begins from the psychology of emotions and the importance of emotional attachment in design. Next, the chapter discusses the visual logic and creation of emotions through the pure anatomy of letterforms and typographic experimentation. The third section continues with how music can evoke emotions and the analogy between the properties of music and typographic characteristics. Chapter 3 4 presents original research of this thesis, initiating with a formative pilot study where three music sequences were selected and three corresponding typographic compositions designed by the researcher. The method of matching one sequence to one design piece was employed. Chapter 4 continues with original research, where modification was made to the methodology to obtain more specific results. Each aspect of static typography was investigated individually. The combination of both aspects was also tested to examine whether it can enhance the emotive impact. Findings from this research intend to present fresh realization to graphic designers, typographers and type designers, highlighting the tangible and enduring essence of static typography, with its power to engage the audience on an emotive level...|$|R
