5|$|Kazamatsuri is {{the setting}} for a secret war being waged by two main groups: Gaia and Guardian. Gaia, an {{organization}} {{under the auspices of}} the environmental conservation group Martel, is populated by nihilistic and misanthropic people able to contract with familiars, which manifest as constructs fueled by the summoner's life force. Martel itself used to be a church and contains within it a holy maiden group of girls with developmental disabilities. Guardian is dedicated to the destruction of familiars and is composed almost entirely of humans who possess special powers. Gaia and Guardian came to Kazamatsuri in the pursuit of the Earth's familiar named Kagari, who manifests as a young, high school age-looking girl. Kagari, the main heroine of Rewrite, has the power to initiate a period of re-evolution, which restarts the process of evolving another means of intelligent life. However, this is done with the use of the Earth's energy, and by the time the events of Rewrite occur, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> energy left to do another re-evolution. Gaia wants to capture Kagari to ensure the destruction of humanity, but Guardian wishes to seek out Kagari to kill her, ensuring that human life continues.|$|E

60|$|Then, because Wesson {{lived in}} one of the company's houses, and his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each. And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped, Barker and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing. Morel gave each of them a {{sovereign}} till <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> sovereigns; each half a crown till <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> half-crowns; each a shilling till <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> shillings.

Ludwig {{was a very strong}} swimmer in his youth, the water was approximately waist-deep where his body was found, and he had not expressed suicidal feelings during the crisis. Gudden's body showed blows to the head and neck and signs of strangulation, leading to the suspicion that he was strangled, although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> evidence to prove this.|$|E

25|$|The pacinian {{corpuscle}} is {{one such}} structure. It has concentric layers like an onion, which form around the axon terminal. When pressure is applied and the corpuscle is deformed, mechanical stimulus is transferred to the axon, which fires. If the pressure is steady, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> stimulus; thus, typically these neurons respond with a transient depolarization during the initial deformation and again when the pressure is removed, which causes the corpuscle to change shape again. Other types of adaptation are important in extending the function {{of a number of}} other neurons.|$|E
25|$|In close-quarters {{fighting}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> {{deadly weapon}} than the knife. In choosing a knife {{there are two}} important factors to bear in mind: balance and keenness. The hilt should fit easily in your hand, and the blade should not be so heavy that it tends to drag the hilt from your fingers in a loose grip. It is essential that the blade have a sharp stabbing point and good cutting edges, because an artery torn through (as against a clean cut) tends to contract and stop the bleeding. If a main artery is cleanly severed, the wounded man will quickly lose consciousness and die.|$|E
25|$|The regular {{international}} passport has incorporated biometric features since 1998. The {{biometric passport}} contains an 8 kB microchip which {{was developed by}} a Malaysian technology firm, IRIS Corporation. In February 2010, the passport was updated {{to comply with the}} ICAO standard on biometric and machine-readable passports, while the pages in a 32-page passport was increased to 48 pages. Beginning April 2013, the passport underwent another round of updating by introducing a polycarbonate sheet that holds the passport bearer's information. The information is laser engraved into the polycarbonate sheet for added security, including a hologram mini-photo of the passport bearer. With this the passport now holds 50 pages instead of 48 pages. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> 64 pages option since 2011.|$|E

25|$|One {{initiative}} of the organization was the Ashcroft Manor Ranch Mega-Landfill Proposal in Ashcroft, British Columbia, in the Thompson Country of the British Columbia Interior, as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> room in the Lower Mainland for Metro Vancouver's garbage. A similar project nearby adjacent {{to the town of}} Cache Creek, British Columbia has almost reached capacity. Environmental concerns about the area's sensitive shrub-steppe climate and ecology are strong, while Highland Valley Copper, near Logan Lake, has offered the use of its mine-pit instead. Other GVRD landfill locations serving the regional district in the past have been in the Fraser Mills area, between the Trans-Canada Highway and the Fraser, and at Port Mann, beneath the south foot of the Port Mann Bridge.|$|E

TARC claims over 7,000 bus stops, although only about 200 of them have benches and rain shelters—the rest simply have a sign indicating the location is a bus stop. The stops are served by 32 weekday and weekend routes, 12 express routes with weekday service only, totalling 44 routes. The daily routes are named for the primary road they serve. On the daily routes, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than hour between scheduled buses at any stop, and on weekdays on the busiest routes have even less time between stops. Most of the daily routes have existed under the same name and number for decades, although their routes have almost all been extended {{to provide access to}} suburban locations.|$|E

The towering monument, made of marble, granite, and bluestone gneiss, it is both the world's tallest stone structure and the world's tallest obelisk, standing [...] according to the National Park Service. Construction of the monument began in 1848, was halted from 1854 to 1877, and was completed in 1884. In a Journal review, dated 17 October 1911, Arnold Bennett said of the monument, [...] "Saw Washington monument. Phallic. Appalling. A national catastrophe – only equalled by the Albert Memorial. Tiny doll-like people waiting to go into it." [...] Dan Burstein says of it, [...] "Speaking of sex symbols, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> phallic symbol in existence than the Washington Monument, and the Capitol dome can be viewed as breastlike." [...] James Webb used a metaphor to praise the [...] "uplift" [...] power of the Washington Monument as a white phallus, [...] "piercing the air like a bayonet". In the futuristic film Hardwired, set in the United States where everything noteworthy is commercialized, the Washington Monument is used as a giant Trojan condoms billboard.|$|E
