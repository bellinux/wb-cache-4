40|$|We analyze firms’ {{production}} and hedging decisions under imperfect competition with potential entry. Specifically, we consider an oligopoly industry producing a homogeneous output in which risk-averse firms incur a sunk cost {{upon entering the}} industry, and, then, compete in Cournot with one another. Each firm faces uncertainty in the input cost when making production decision, and has access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> market <b>to</b> hedge its random cost. We provide two sets of results. First, we show that there exists a unique equilibrium in which, in contrast to previous results in the literature, {{production and}} output price depend {{on the distribution of}} the spot price and risk aversion, i. e., there is no separation when the firms have access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> market. Second, we study the effect of access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> market on entry, production, and prices. The effect of access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> market on <b>the</b> number of firms is ambiguous depending on the value of <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> price and <b>the</b> parameters of the model. We also show that hedging induces <b>the</b> risk-averse firm <b>to</b> produce more, while speculating reduces production...|$|R
5|$|Robert Zemeckis, the director, {{originally}} wanted Fox to play Marty, but Gary David Goldberg {{the creator}} of Family Ties, which Fox was working on at the time, refused to allow Zemeckis even to approach Fox as he felt that as Meredith Baxter was on maternity leave at the time, Fox's character Alex Keaton was needed to carry the show in her absence. Eric Stoltz was cast and was already filming Back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future,</b> but Zemeckis felt that Stoltz was not giving the right type of performance for the humor involved. Zemeckis quickly replaced Stoltz with Fox, whose schedule was now more open {{with the return of}} Meredith Baxter. He was considered for the role of Mark Kendall in Once Bitten, but it eventually went to Jim Carrey. During filming, Fox would rehearse for Family Ties from 10 a.m to 6 p.m, then rush to the Back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> set where he would rehearse and shoot until 2:30a.m. This schedule lasted for two full months. Back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> was both a commercial and critical success. The film spent 8 consecutive weekends as the number-one grossing movie at the US box office in 1985 and eventually earned a worldwide total of $381.11 million. Variety applauded the performances, stating that Fox and his co-star Christopher Lloyd imbued Marty and Doc Brown's friendship with a quality reminiscent of King Arthur and Merlin. The film was later followed by two similarly-successful sequels, Back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> Part II (1989) and Back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> Part III (1990).|$|E
5|$|A {{musical theater}} production, also called Back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future,</b> is in {{development}} for a debut in London's West End theatre during the film's 30th anniversary in 2015. Zemeckis and Gale reunited {{to write the}} play, while Silvestri and Glen Ballard provide music.|$|E

5|$|Back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> was {{released}} on July 3, 1985, grossing over $381 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1985. It won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film, and the Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing, as well as receiving three additional Academy Award nominations, five BAFTA nominations, and four Golden Globe nominations, including Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy). Ronald Reagan even quoted the film in his 1986 State of the Union Address. In 2007, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry, and in June 2008 the American Film Institute's special AFI's 10 Top 10 designated the film as the 10th-best film in the science fiction genre. The film {{marked the beginning of}} a franchise, with two sequels, Back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> Part II (1989) and Back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> Part III (1990), as well as an animated series, , several video games and a forthcoming musical.|$|E

30|$|For those wanting <b>to</b> know <b>the</b> <b>future</b> {{and reduce}} uncertainty, pluralising {{possibilities}} can confuse and confound. Opening <b>the</b> <b>future</b> also undermines <b>the</b> efforts of those seeking to make particular futures appear inevitable, thereby securing their own positions through time. Therefore some caution is required when seeking to advocate {{and develop the}} use of strategic foresight in policy making. Given the role of strategic foresight <b>to</b> reassert <b>the</b> primacy of <b>the</b> <b>future</b> as a domain of the possible, strategic foresight does not claim <b>to</b> know <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> but understand and negotiate <b>futures.</b> <b>To</b> encompass <b>the</b> <b>future</b> as <b>the</b> unknown is a project fundamentally {{at odds with the}} empiricist epistemologies underlying orthodox approaches <b>to</b> planning and <b>the</b> <b>future</b> [29]. Better techniques for gathering and analysing information are a necessary but insufficient condition for policy making. Rather than claim <b>to</b> know what <b>the</b> <b>future</b> is, or what <b>the</b> <b>future</b> should be, strategic foresight subverts the inevitable and envisions and educes what <b>the</b> <b>future</b> could be [30]. In this regard, strategic foresight does not just offer a different set of tools, but presents a different ontology and orientation as to how <b>to</b> understand <b>the</b> <b>future</b> [31 – 33].|$|R
