5|$|During the Syrian Civil War, <b>Turkish</b> F-16s were {{tasked with}} {{airspace}} protection on the Syrian border. After the RF-4 downing in June 2012 Turkey changed its rules of engagements against Syrian aircraft, resulting in scrambles and downings of Syrian combat aircraft. On 16 September 2013, a <b>Turkish</b> Air Force F-16 shot down a Syrian Arab Air Force Mil Mi-17 helicopter in Latakia province near <b>Turkish</b> boder. On 23 March 2014, a <b>Turkish</b> Air Force F-16 shot down a Syrian Arab Air Force Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 when it allegedly entered <b>Turkish</b> air space during a ground attack mission against Al Qaeda-linked insurgents. On 16 May 2015, Two <b>Turkish</b> Air Force F-16s shot down a Syrian Mohajer 4 UAV firing two AIM-9 missiles after it trespassed into <b>Turkish</b> airspace for 5 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Geographical name {{changes in}} Turkey have been undertaken, periodically, in bulk from 1913 {{to the present}} by {{successive}} <b>Turkish</b> governments. Thousands of names within the <b>Turkish</b> Republic or the Ottoman Empire have lost or departed from their popular or historic alternatives in favour of recognizably <b>Turkish</b> names, {{as part of the}} Turkification policy. The governments have argued that such names are foreign and/or divisive against <b>Turkish</b> unity. Names changed were usually of Armenian, Greek, Georgian (Including Laz), Bulgarian, Kurdish, Assyrian, or Arabic origin.|$|E
5|$|In modern <b>Turkish,</b> {{the name}} is written as İstanbul, with a dotted İ, as the <b>Turkish</b> {{alphabet}} distinguishes between a dotted and dotless I. In English the stress is on the last syllable (bul), but in <b>Turkish</b> {{it is on the}} second syllable (tan). A person from the city is an İstanbullu (plural: İstanbullular), although Istanbulite is used in English.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 21st century, the chronically high {{inflation}} was brought under control; this led to the launch of a new currency, the <b>Turkish</b> new lira (Yeni Türk Lirası) in 2005, to cement the acquisition of the economic reforms and erase the vestiges of an unstable economy. In 2009, after only four years in circulation, the <b>Turkish</b> new lira was renamed back to the <b>Turkish</b> lira with the introduction of new banknotes and coins (and the withdrawal of the <b>Turkish</b> new lira banknotes and coins that were introduced in 2005), but the ISO 4217 code of the <b>Turkish</b> new lira (TRY) remains in use for the current <b>Turkish</b> lira in the foreign exchange market.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that the <b>Turkish</b> 27th and 57th Infantry Regiments lost around 2,000 men, or fifty per cent of their combined strength. The full number of <b>Turkish</b> casualties for the day has not been recorded. During the campaign, 8,708 Australians and 2,721 New Zealanders were killed. The exact number of <b>Turkish</b> dead is not known but has been estimated around 87,000.|$|E
5|$|Most state-run {{radio and}} {{television}} stations are based in Ankara, but Istanbul is the primary hub of <b>Turkish</b> media. The industry {{has its roots in}} the former Ottoman capital, where the first <b>Turkish</b> newspaper, Takvim-i Vekayi (Calendar of Affairs), was published in 1831. The Cağaloğlu street on which the newspaper was printed, Bâb-ı Âli Street, rapidly became the center of <b>Turkish</b> print media, alongside Beyoğlu across the Golden Horn.|$|E
5|$|On 18 June 1992, a Greek Mirage F-1 crashed {{during a}} dogfight with a <b>Turkish</b> F-16. On 8 February 1995, a <b>Turkish</b> F-16 {{crashed into the}} Aegean after being intercepted by Greek Mirage F1 fighters.|$|E
5|$|On 23 May 2006, two Greek F-16s intercepted a <b>Turkish</b> RF-4 {{reconnaissance}} aircraft and two F-16 escorts {{off the coast}} of the Greek island of Karpathos, within the Athens FIR. A mock dogfight ensued between the two sides, resulting in a midair collision between a <b>Turkish</b> F-16 and a Greek F-16. The <b>Turkish</b> pilot ejected safely, but the Greek pilot died due to damage caused by the collision.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days later}} the NZMRB {{was moved to the}} south to support the 2nd Light Horse Brigade at Ziza. The light-horsemen had taken the {{surrender}} of a large <b>Turkish</b> force, part of the <b>Turkish</b> Fourth Army, then had to defend them from the Arab tribesmen. When the brigade arrived the Australian and <b>Turkish</b> troops, who were still armed, were holding a perimeter facing the Arab force. The brigade's appearance resolved the situation and the <b>Turkish</b> troops surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{founding}} Nea Salamina sought to develop friendly {{relations with the}} <b>Turkish</b> Cypriots in Famagusta, and <b>Turkish</b> Cypriots (including Siekkeris, Nita and Moustafa) played during the early 1950s. When the team joined the CFA, it played against <b>Turkish</b> teams (including Demir Sports, Gençlik Gücü and the Mağusa Türk Gücü) in the second division. When <b>Turkish</b> Cypriot clubs began withdrawing from CFA tournaments of CFA in late 1955, the club tried to convince them to continue and <b>Turkish</b> players remained welcome in Nea Salamina. In 1962 Kallikas {{was transferred to the}} club, and in 1970 Neziak (of <b>Turkish</b> origin) was also transferred. In 2004 <b>Turkish</b> Cypriots Imam and Oulousoi were transferred to Nea Salamina, the first <b>Turkish</b> Cypriot footballers in the CAF in thirty years.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Squadron, {{commanded}} by Major Charles Dick, were also sent forward {{to support the}} 2nd Squadron's attempt to break through to the post. Advancing along the ridge from No.2 Post, they reached {{a position on the}} open plateau to the north of No.3 Post, but neither of the relieving squadrons could break through the <b>Turkish</b> lines, and were confronted by heavy <b>Turkish</b> fire from the surrounding higher ground. They were blocked by the sheer number of <b>Turkish</b> troops. Around noon the Turks undermined and blew up part of the trench at No.3 Post, which they then occupied. <b>Turkish</b> attacks continued all day, and they brought into action a mountain artillery gun from a nearby position. It was now estimated that around 3,000 <b>Turkish</b> troops were involved in the assault on No.3 Post.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Turkish</b> Air Force {{acquired}} {{its first}} F-16s in 1987. <b>Turkish</b> F-16s {{participated in the}} Bosnia Herzegovina and Kosovo since 1993 in support of United Nations resolutions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Turkish</b> {{government}} {{companies for}} research and development in military technologies include <b>Turkish</b> Aerospace Industries, Aselsan, Havelsan, Roketsan, MKE, among others. <b>Turkish</b> Satellite Assembly, Integration and Test Center (UMET) is a spacecraft production and testing facility owned by the Ministry of National Defence and operated by the <b>Turkish</b> Aerospace Industries (TAI). The <b>Turkish</b> Space Launch System (UFS) is a project to develop the satellite launch capability of Turkey. It consists of the construction of a spaceport, the development of satellite launch vehicles as well as the establishment of remote earth stations. Türksat is the sole communications satellite operator in Turkey and has launched the Türksat series of satellites into orbit. Göktürk-1 and Göktürk-2 are Turkey's earth observation satellites for reconnaissance, operated by the Ministry of National Defence. BILSAT-1 and RASAT are the scientific earth observation satellites operated by the TÜBİTAK Space Technologies Research Institute.|$|E

5|$|All Eurasian {{composite}} bows {{derive from}} the same nomad origins, but every culture that used them has made its own adaptations to the basic design. The <b>Turkish,</b> Mongolian, and Korean bows were standardized when archery lost its military function and became a popular sport. Recent <b>Turkish</b> bows are optimized for flight shooting.|$|E
5|$|At 14:45, {{covered by}} an {{artillery}} barrage and machine-gun fire, the <b>Turkish</b> troops counter-attacked again. The regiment's machine gunners returned fire {{and for a}} short time the battle became a machine-gun engagement. During this time the Wellington Mounted Rifles, to the right, had occupied a prominent hill, but were under heavy fire. To support them, the 3rd Squadron sent two troops to engage their opponents, which they caught {{in the bottom of a}} valley, with enfilade fire. Then in front of the regiment a fresh <b>Turkish</b> battalion was sent to assault them. In some places, the <b>Turkish</b> force got close enough to throw hand grenades into the regiment's defences. These killed or wounded all those defending a small hill, which was then occupied by the <b>Turkish</b> troops, bringing indirect fire onto the rest of the regiment's positions, which by now were becoming untenable. At first, messengers sent to the 4th Squadron asking for assistance failed to get through. Eventually the squadron received the message and charged across the open ground, recapturing the hill. This brought the rest of the <b>Turkish</b> line into range of the squadron's guns. Confronted by the new threat, the <b>Turkish</b> troops retired back to their starting point. McCarroll was ordering a regiment attack on the orange grove when he was wounded in the neck and shoulder, forcing Major Henry Whitehorn to assume temporary command of the regiment. By then it was getting dark and the only <b>Turkish</b> offensive action was an artillery bombardment. Instead of attacking, the regiment spent the rest of the day evacuating the wounded and strengthening their lines. Their casualties during the battle were fifteen dead and seventy-four wounded. The next morning it was discovered that Ayun Kara had been evacuated by the <b>Turkish</b> troops.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the year}} the <b>Turkish</b> forces had been pushed out of the Sinai, and in January 1917, orders were given for the {{division}} to attack Rafa on the Egyptian–Palestine border. By dawn on 9 January, the regiment and division had reached the border, and the brigade manoeuvred to attack Rafa from the north-east. The 8th Squadron, leading the regiment, was moving around to the north of village, when the <b>Turkish</b> defenders opened fire on them. The regiment galloped forward, and one of their troops captured fifty prisoners at a police post. The remainder captured an uncompleted trench system, and another 171 prisoners, six of them German officers. The regiment was now position to block the <b>Turkish</b> withdrawal east, and were also able to observe the main <b>Turkish</b> defences.|$|E
5|$|Following an {{alliance}} contracted in 1912, Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia {{declared war on}} the Ottoman <b>Turkish</b> Empire. Their goal was to definitely expel Turks from Europe. The First Balkan War started on 8 October 1912 and lasted six weeks. Serbians reached Skopje on 26 October. The <b>Turkish</b> forces had left the city the day before. The Serbian annexation led to the exodus of many Turks: 725 <b>Turkish</b> families left the city on 27 January 1913. The same year, the city population was evaluated at 37,000 by the Serbian authorities.|$|E
5|$|Galatasaray {{entered the}} final {{in search for}} the Treble. Their fourteenth and fourth {{successive}} <b>Turkish</b> league title was confirmed on the final matchday. The <b>Turkish</b> club added the domestic cup to their trophy cabinet, after Antalyaspor was defeated with a 5–3 victory in the 2000 <b>Turkish</b> Cup Final. The side participated in their first UEFA Cup and European competition final, while also becoming the first ever team from Turkey to make the final in a UEFA club football competition.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{argue that}} the mass {{confiscation}} of Armenian properties was {{an important factor in}} forming the economic basis of the <b>Turkish</b> Republic while endowing Turkey's economy with capital. The appropriation {{led to the formation of}} a new <b>Turkish</b> bourgeoisie and an exclusive middle class.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{after the}} {{unification}} of football federations, Nea Salamina used GSE Stadium. The city's Municipal Stadium {{was used by the}} team for training. This period lasted until 1974, when Famagusta was occupied by the <b>Turkish</b> Army after the <b>Turkish</b> invasion in Cyprus and the club was forced to move its headquarters.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Aziz Sancar, a <b>Turkish</b> {{professor}} at the University of North Carolina, won the Nobel Chemistry Prize along with Tomas Lindahl and Paul Modrich, for their work on how cells repair damaged DNA.

5|$|Kuleli Military High School, {{along the}} shores of the Bosphorus in Çengelköy, and <b>Turkish</b> Naval High School, located on one of the Princes' Islands, are {{military}} high schools, complemented by three military academies—the <b>Turkish</b> Air Force, <b>Turkish</b> Military, and <b>Turkish</b> Naval Academies. Darüşşafaka High School provides free education to children across the country missing at least one parent. Darüşşafaka begins instruction with the fourth grade, providing instruction in English and, starting in sixth grade, a second foreign language—German or French. Other prominent high schools in the city include Istanbul Lisesi (founded in 1884), Kabataş Erkek Lisesi (founded in 1908) and Kadıköy Anadolu Lisesi (founded in 1955).|$|E
5|$|Much of the <b>Turkish</b> Cypriot {{migration}} to the UK occurred {{as a consequence of}} intercommunal violence in Cyprus during the 1950s and 1960s. Many <b>Turkish</b> Cypriots viewed the EOKA insurgency as an attempt on the part of Greek Cypriots to establish hegemony on the island with the aim of achieving union with Greece. By 1958, there were around 8,500 <b>Turkish</b> Cypriots in Britain. Between 1960 and 1962, the inflow increased substantially because of a fear that Britain would impose immigration controls, and indeed the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 did reduce migration flows from Cyprus to Britain. Although the expansion of Britain's <b>Turkish</b> Cypriot community took place primarily between the late 1940s and the mid-1960s, there was a further influx of around 3,000 immigrants after partition in 1974. Migration continued because of the political and economic situation in the 1970s and 1980s, and <b>Turkish</b> Cypriots have continued to migrate to the UK due to high unemployment rates in northern Cyprus. In the early 1980s, it was estimated that 160,000 Cypriots were resident in the UK, 20 to 25 per cent of them being <b>Turkish</b> Cypriots. Since Cyprus joined the European Union in May 2004, holders of Republic of Cyprus passports have been able to migrate freely to the UK under EU law.|$|E
5|$|On 12 November Allenby made {{preparations}} for battle the following day. He ordered {{an attack by}} the 52nd (Lowland) Division to extend their position across the Nahr Sukereir on the <b>Turkish</b> Army's right flank. Reinforced with two additional brigades, he ordered the Australian Mounted Division to advance towards Tel es Safi where they encountered a determined and substantial <b>Turkish</b> counterattack. This counterattack forced the mounted division to concede the territory gained during the day, before fighting the <b>Turkish</b> Army to a standstill in front of Summeil. On {{the morning after the}} battle at Mughar Ridge, Junction Station was occupied and during the following days other villages in the area were found to have been abandoned. Later in the morning of 14 November New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade ran into a determined and well entrenched <b>Turkish</b> rearguard near Ayun Kara, which they attacked. Fierce close quarter fighting against the <b>Turkish</b> 3rd Infantry Division continued during the afternoon. Although severely threatened, the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade eventually prevailed and went on to occupy Jaffa two days later.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July 1915, {{after two}} weeks in reserve, the {{battalion}} relieved the 12th Battalion at Tasmanian Post, on the right on the Australian front line. On 31 July, a party of around 200 men led by Leane were ordered to capture a section of <b>Turkish</b> trenches {{in front of the}} battalion's position. After engineers detonated three mines prepared near <b>Turkish</b> communications trenches, the storming party captured the <b>Turkish</b> trench following a bayonet charge, with the loss of one officer and 36 other ranks killed. Seventy-three other members of the battalion were wounded during the attack, including Leane, who was mentioned in despatches. <b>Turkish</b> casualties were estimated by the battalion to be 60 killed.|$|E
5|$|On 8 October 1996, 7 {{months after}} the {{escalation}} over Imia a Greek Mirage 2000 reportedly fired an R.550 Magic II missile and shot down a <b>Turkish</b> F-16D over the Aegean Sea. The <b>Turkish</b> pilot died, while the co-pilot ejected and was rescued by Greek forces. In August 2012, after the downing of a RF-4E on the Syrian Coast, <b>Turkish</b> Defence Minister İsmet Yılmaz confirmed that the <b>Turkish</b> F-16D was shot down by a Greek Mirage 2000 with an R.550 Magic II in 1996 after violating Greek airspace near Chios island. Greece denies that the F-16 was shot down. Both Mirage 2000 pilots reported that the F-16 caught fire and they saw one parachute.|$|E
5|$|One {{estimate}} {{states that}} 130,000nationals of the breakaway <b>Turkish</b> Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) {{resided in the}} UK in 2008, a figure also given by the <b>Turkish</b> consulate in London, whereas the Museum of London reports that 100,000Turkish Cypriots live in Britain—20,000 more than in Cyprus itself. Nergis Canefe suggests a figure of 190,000, whereas the TRNC Ministry of Foreign Affairs suggested in May 2001 that 200,000 <b>Turkish</b> Cypriots {{were living in the}} United Kingdom. Evidence submitted by the Home Office to the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee in February 2011 suggested that there were about 300,000 <b>Turkish</b> Cypriots living in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Other sources also list Egypt, Italy, and the <b>Turkish</b> Empire.|$|E
5|$|That {{night the}} {{regiment}} bivouacked at Katib Gannit {{and returned to}} the site of the battle the next day, 6 August, but the <b>Turkish</b> army had withdrawn eastwards. The brigade was ordered to advance until contact was regained with the <b>Turkish</b> force, which they located around 12:00, to the east of Oghratina. The regiment remained in contact all day, without suffering any casualties. They also located a telephone wire that the withdrawing Turks had failed to disconnect, enabling them to monitor the German and <b>Turkish</b> command issuing orders.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 <b>Turkish</b> Grand Prix (formally the 2010 Formula 1 <b>Turkish</b> Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 30 May 2010 at the Istanbul Park circuit near Istanbul, Turkey. It was {{the seventh}} {{round of the}} 2010 Formula One season and the sixth <b>Turkish</b> Grand Prix. The 58-lap race was won by McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton who started from second position. His {{teammate}} Jenson Button finished second, and Red Bull driver Mark Webber came in third.|$|E
5|$|The Australians on 400 Plateau had {{for some}} time been {{subjected}} to sniping and artillery fire and could see <b>Turkish</b> troops digging in on Gun Ridge. Around 13:00 a column of <b>Turkish</b> reinforcements from the 27th Infantry Regiment, in at least battalion strength, were observed moving along the ridge-line from the south. The Turks then turned towards 400 Plateau and advanced in extended order. The <b>Turkish</b> counter-attack soon forced the advanced Australian troops to withdraw, and their machine-gun fire caused them heavy casualties. It {{was not long before}} the attack had forced a wedge between the Australians on Baby 700 and those on 400 Plateau. The heavy <b>Turkish</b> fire onto Lone Pine forced the survivors to withdraw back to the western slope of 400 Plateau. At 14:25 <b>Turkish</b> artillery and small arms fire was so heavy that the Indian artillerymen were forced to push their guns back off the plateau by hand, and they reformed on the beach.|$|E
5|$|The German navy {{formally}} transferred {{ownership of}} the vessel to the <b>Turkish</b> government on 2 November. According {{to the terms of}} the Treaty of Sèvres between the Ottoman Empire and the Western Allies, Yavuz was to have been handed over to the Royal Navy as war reparations. After the <b>Turkish</b> War of Independence, led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the Treaty of Sèvres was discarded, and the Treaty of Lausanne was signed in its place in 1923. Under this treaty, the new <b>Turkish</b> republic regained possession of much its fleet, including Yavuz.|$|E
5|$|The Hood {{event was}} the {{inspiration}} for the 2006 <b>Turkish</b> action film Valley of the Wolves Iraq. The film opens with the depiction of an almost identical incident, following afterwards a fictional story in which the <b>Turkish</b> protagonist seeks retaliation against the American Commander responsible for the incident.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} {{attended}} by 38,919 spectators, as Galatasaray won 4–1 on penalties following extra time, making {{it the first time}} for a <b>Turkish</b> side to win the contest and a European honour. They also obtained the Treble, having previously achieved the <b>Turkish</b> league championship, and the <b>Turkish</b> domestic cup titles, as well as qualifying for the 2000 UEFA Super Cup and the 2001 FIFA Club World Championship. The final was somewhat marred by the riots between supporters of the two sides.|$|E
5|$|<b>Turkish</b> {{nationalism}} and secularism {{were two of}} the six founding principles of the <b>Turkish</b> Republic. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the leader of {{the early decades of the}} Republic, aimed to create a nation state (Turkish: Ulus) from the <b>Turkish</b> remnants of the Ottoman Empire. During the first three decades of the Republic, efforts to Turkify geographical names were a recurring theme. Imported maps containing references to historical regions such as Armenia, Kurdistan, or Lazistan (the official name of the province of Rize until 1921) were prohibited (as was the case with Der Grosse Weltatlas, a map published in Leipzig).|$|E
