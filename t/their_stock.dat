5|$|Mac Senour left Sega in 1993 for Atari, {{where he}} {{received}} an increase in pay and status. He later worked at Konami and Electronic Arts. In his first days at Atari, Senour was sent to Paris, where he remembered an excess of unsold Menacers in a Virgin Megastore display. His translators told the clerk that Senour {{was responsible for the}} Menacer, and when Senour offered to autograph <b>their</b> <b>stock,</b> the clerk replied in slow English that Senour could autograph the items he purchased.|$|E
5|$|After the Fall of France, some French {{scientists}} {{escaped to}} Britain with <b>their</b> <b>stock</b> of heavy water. They were temporarily {{installed in the}} Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where they worked on reactor design. The MAUD Committee was uncertain whether this was relevant to the main task of Tube Alloys, that of building an atomic bomb, although there remained a possibility that a reactor {{could be used to}} breed plutonium, which might be used in one. It therefore recommended that they be relocated to the United States, and co-located with the Manhattan Project's reactor effort. Due to American concerns about security (many of the scientists were foreign nationals) and patent claims by the French scientists and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), it was decided to relocate them to Canada instead.|$|E
5|$|Another risk to rat owners is Rat-bite fever. This is a {{rare disease}} among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed <b>their</b> <b>stock</b> of rats in masses (usually with the {{intention}} of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders who fail to take good care of their rats. This disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat, but is characterized by the swelling of the site of the bite or scratch where it was contracted, a fever, vomiting and body aches. It is contracted by being bitten or scratched by an infected rat.|$|E
50|$|At 4 and 6 September Lavenda Holding and Telegraaf Media Groep sold 17 {{percent of}} <b>their</b> <b>stocks</b> to {{institutional}} investors.

5|$|According to Baley, {{political}} and economic factors prompted two Hedgpeth and two Baley families to leave northwestern Missouri for California in early 1858. One factor was {{the enactment of the}} Kansas-Nebraska Act, which admitted Nebraska into the Union as a free territory and granted Kansas the right to decide on the legality of slavery within the state. The resulting tensions between pro-slavery and anti-slavery groups fueled conflict near the Missouri state line, affecting its western counties, including Nodaway, where the Baleys and Hedgpeths lived. In Baley's opinion, the financial Panic of 1857 further contributed to instability in the region, driving many mid-westerners to seek a better life in California. The combined Baley-Hedgpeth outfits were led by a forty-four-year-old veteran of the Black Hawk War, Gillum Baley, and comprised eight Murphy wagons, sixty-two oxen, seventy-five head of cattle, and several riding horses. They employed half-a-dozen grubstakers to tend <b>their</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E
5|$|Olympus had {{a market}} {{capitalisation}} of ¥673billion on 13 October 2011, immediately before Woodford was sacked. By {{the end of}} the next day, the valuation had fallen to ¥422billion ($5.5billion). Analysts at Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Nomura Securities, concerned about corporate governance issues at the company as well as its balance sheet, all immediately downgraded <b>their</b> <b>stock</b> ratings. Goldman Sachs, who had only upgraded its rating in a report dated 12 October, suspended its coverage after Woodford was removed from office. Nomura and JPMorgan announced on 20 October that their coverage of the company was halted. It was reported that Government of Singapore Investment Corp., the Singapore sovereign wealth fund {{which was one of the}} principal shareholders, immediately disposed of its 2percent stake on the first hint of scandal. The share price plunged several days running upon market fears that the shares would be delisted as the company could not meet its reporting mandatory deadline for its quarterly results; in the week to 18 November Nippon Life announced that its stake had been reduced by one-third, from 8.18 percent to 5.11 percent, because of the uncertainty; Mitsubishi reduced its stake from 10 percent to 7.6 percent.|$|E

25|$|Burroughs's parents {{sold the}} rights to his grandfather's {{invention}} and had no share in the Burroughs Corporation. Shortly before the 1929 stock market crash, they sold <b>their</b> <b>stock</b> for $200,000 (equivalent to approximately $ in today's funds).|$|E
25|$|The Aiken {{massacre}} {{took place}} the following month. In October 1857, Mormons arrested six Californians traveling through Utah and charged them with being spies for the U.S. Army. They were released, but were later murdered and robbed of <b>their</b> <b>stock</b> and $25,000.|$|E

25|$|In {{the middle}} of 1881, the Mexican {{military}} dropped taxes on alcohol and tobacco and began vigorously pursuing the Cowboys.

5000|$|One {{criticism}} of divestment {{focuses on the}} belief that institutional selling of a certain stock lowers its market value. Therefore, the company's net worth becomes devalued and the owners of the company may lose substantial paper assets. In addition, institutional divestment may encourage other investors to sell <b>their</b> <b>stocks</b> for fear of lower prices, which in turn lowers prices even further. Finally, lower stock prices limits a corporation's ability to sell a portion of <b>their</b> <b>stocks</b> in order to raise funds to expand the business.|$|R

25|$|Foreign {{companies}} that want <b>their</b> <b>stock</b> {{to be limited}} to being traded by only certain individuals may set up a restricted program.

40|$|We use a North–South {{model with}} {{property}} right differences and resource dynamics {{to study the}} effects of trade on resource use and welfare. Autarky is likely to Pareto-dominate free trade in the long run when the environment is quite fragile, and the result is reversed when the environment is quite resilient. Trade may cause an environmentally poor country to “drag down” its richer trading partner, when they degrade <b>their</b> <b>stocks</b> which would be preserved under autarky.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the standard economics theory, {{an analysis of the}} Survey of Consumer Finance shows that wealthy investors have a higher return on <b>their</b> <b>stocks</b> than <b>their</b> poorer counterparts. The paper presents a general financial and economic theory of risk and search behavior to address the question if why wealthy investors have a higher return on <b>their</b> <b>stocks.</b> Two additional facts emerge: (i) wealthy investors employ more productive search efforts, and (ii) financial risk bearing and search efforts are complementary. This study develops an explanation for the wealth inequality and the equity premium puzzle as well as the policy implications of the privatization of social security...|$|R

25|$|An unusual kind {{of social}} {{influence}} is the self-fulfilling prophecy. This is a prediction that, in being made, actually causes itself to become true. For example, in the stock market, if {{it is widely believed}} that a crash is imminent, investors may lose confidence, sell most of <b>their</b> <b>stock,</b> and thus actually cause the crash. Similarly, people may expect hostility in others and actually induce this hostility by their own behavior.|$|E
25|$|According to Lapierre & Collins, on the ground, {{logistics}} {{were completely}} neglected, and their leader, Fawzi al-Qawuqji, envisaged that his troops survive {{only on the}} expenses accorded {{to them by the}} Palestinian population.
