5|$|According to {{songwriter}} P. F. Sloan, Landy {{took advantage}} of Sloan's disappearance and claimed at one point {{to be the real}} P. F. Sloan. He explains that it was an attempt by Landy to gain credibility and appease members of the medical community who were questioning why Landy felt <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> appropriate songwriting collaborator for Wilson.|$|E

5|$|Adonis {{originally}} was a Phoenician god of fertility representing {{the spirit of}} vegetation. It is further speculated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> avatar of the version of Ba'al, worshipped in Ugarit. It is likely that lack of clarity concerning whether Myrrha was called Smyrna, and who her father was, originated in Cyprus before the Greeks first encountered the myth. However, {{it is clear that}} the Greeks added much to the Adonis-Myrrha story, before it was first recorded by classical scholars.|$|E

5000|$|The groups (Latin and Anglo New Orleaneans) had “two {{different}} schools of politics differed radically … in aspiration and method. One hopes Latins, {{and the other}} doubts Anglos. Thus we often perceive that one makes every effort to acquire merits, the other to gain advantages. One aspires to equality, the other to identity. One will forget <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Negro in order to think <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> man; the other will forget <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> man to think <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Negro.” ...|$|R

5|$|Empress Maud, {{the only}} {{legitimate}} living child of Henry I, landed in England in 1139 {{in an attempt}} to press her claim to the monarchy. She was soon besieged by King Stephen's forces at Arundel castle. Stephen allowed Maud a safe conduct to Bristol and provided her with an escort, which included William de Braose, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> adherent of King Stephen. William was present as a witness when three charters were issued by Stephen at Lewes dated to the years 1148–53, therefore it appears that he remained loyal to the king until the Treaty of Wallingford ended the hostilities.|$|E
5|$|Four days later, on 25 January, it was {{announced}} that the Grizzlies was sold to Chicago-based Michael Heisley for US$160million. At a press conference, he stated that he had the support of Stern, that he was committed to keeping the franchise in Vancouver, to making it a winning team, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> owner that was committed to the market.|$|E

5|$|In early May, {{part of the}} {{battalion}} was sent to reinforce the 3rd Battalion. At around midnight {{on the night of}} 3/4 May, the 2nd Battalion's commanding officer, Braund, who was partially deaf, was accidentally killed as he attempted to visit 1st Brigade headquarters after failing to hear a challenge from a sentry, who shot him believing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> enemy soldier. Following his burial, {{the battalion}} second-in-command, Robert Scobie, was promoted to lieutenant colonel and took over as commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|Kogălniceanu was a {{democratic}} and nationalist politician who combined liberalism {{with the conservative}} principles acquired during his education, taking inspiration from {{the policies of the}} Prussian statesmen Baron vom und zum Stein and Karl August von Hardenberg. German statesmen were however disinclined to consider him one of their own: Bernhard von Bülow took for granted rumors <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> agent of the Russians, and further alleged that the Romanian land reform was a sham.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Warelwast's {{background}} or family before 1087. Later in life {{he was involved in}} founding Augustinian houses of canons, which– according to historian – implies <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> Augustinian canon or spent some of his early years in a house of such canons. Several medieval chroniclers hostile to Warelwast, including Eadmer, claim that he was illiterate, but his career suggests otherwise, as it involved the extensive use of written documents. He must also have been an accomplished speaker, given the number of times he was used as a diplomat. He was possibly educated at Laon, where later in life he sent his nephew, Robert Warelwast, to school. Another nephew, William, became the bishop's steward.|$|E
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{the son of}} Jesse, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> king, <b>that</b> God {{raised him}} up in mercy, that God gave {{testimony}} of him, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> man after God's own heart, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should fulfil all his will (v 22).|$|R
60|$|When he died, {{the monks}} settled <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Saint, {{and called him}} Saint Dunstan ever afterwards. They {{might just as well}} have settled <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> coach-horse, and {{could just as easily have}} called him one.|$|R

5|$|One {{result of}} Wallace's early travels {{is a modern}} {{controversy}} about his nationality. Since Wallace was born in Monmouthshire, some sources have considered him to be Welsh. However, some historians have questioned this because neither of his parents was Welsh, his family only briefly lived in Monmouthshire, the Welsh people Wallace knew in his childhood considered him to be English, and because Wallace himself consistently referred to himself as English rather than Welsh (even when writing about his time in Wales). One Wallace scholar has stated that the most reasonable interpretation is therefore <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> Englishman born in Wales.|$|E
5|$|The XLVI Motorised Corps {{encountered}} little {{resistance from}} the 4th Army, particularly from the 27th Infantry Division Savska and 40th Infantry Division Slavonska, and by the evening of 10 April the whole 4th Army was disintegrating, and all aircraft of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group had been destroyed. Petrović wanted to dismiss Marić as commander of the 27th Infantry Division Savska due to suspicions <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> Ustaše sympathiser, but could not identify a suitable replacement.|$|E
5|$|The {{actions of}} both commanders have been {{extensively}} analyzed in this action. While Montcalm performed well during the battle, some tactical options escaped his notice, {{and some of}} his actions in preparing the defenses at Carillon are open to question. In contrast, almost everything Abercrombie did has been questioned. It is widely held among historians <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> incompetent commander.|$|E
50|$|Palena (born ca. 1120, Mokae, Hana, Maui) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{name of a}} chief {{mentioned}} in the ancient Hawaiian legends, where it <b>is</b> said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Moʻi - king of Maui in ancient Hawaii.

6000|$|... 'Before the {{introduction}} of Christianity,' said Herbert, 'the philosophic schools answered to our present religious sects. You said of <b>a</b> man <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Stoic or an Epicurean, as you say of <b>a</b> man now <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Calvinist or a Wesleyan.' ...|$|R
5|$|The {{first major}} work to {{represent}} this new orthography was Elihu Doty's Anglo-Chinese Manual with Romanized Colloquial in the Amoy Dialect, published in 1853. The manual {{can therefore be}} regarded as the first presentation of a pre-modern POJ, a significant step onwards from Medhurst's orthography and different from today's system in only a few details. From this point on various authors adjusted some of the consonants and vowels, but the system of tone marks from Doty's Manual survives intact in modern POJ. John Van Nest Talmage has traditionally been regarded as the founder of POJ among the community which uses the orthography, although it now seems <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> early promoter of the system, rather than its inventor.|$|E
5|$|The {{little that}} is known of Mac Scelling {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> early archetype of what latter became known as gallowglasses, heavily-armed mercenaries, recruited from the West Highlands and Islands of Scotland by Irish rulers in later centuries. Although first specifically recorded {{in the last decade}} of the thirteenth century, gallowglasses were almost certainly utilised at least a generation before. The aforesaid apparent reference to Mac Scelling by La Geste des Engleis en Yrlande could be evidence that he had taken up residence in Ireland like later gallowglasses.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} view of Gregory is <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> orthodox Trinitarian theologian, who {{was influenced}} by the neoplatonism of Plotinus and believed in universal salvation following Origen. However, as a highly original and sophisticated thinker, Gregory is difficult to classify, and many aspects of his theology are contentious among both conservative Eastern Orthodox theologians and Western academic scholarship. This is often {{due to the lack of}} systematic structure and the presence of terminological inconsistencies in Gregory's work.|$|E

5000|$|It has <b>been</b> {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{carries on}} a tradition {{thousands of years}} old; <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> symbol of rebirth, regeneration and fertility (similar to the Green Man) that pre-dates almost all contemporary religions; <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> [...] "scapegoat" [...] and may even originally have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> sacrificial victim.|$|R
5|$|Walter was {{a witness}} on 12 of Henry's royal {{charters}}, all before 1131. He {{also was a}} witness for some royal charters issued by Henry's successor, King Stephen of England, early in Stephen's reign. One was a charter issued at Henry's funeral on 4 January 1136 and another at Stephen's court at Easter 1136. These two charter attestations show <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> early supporter of Stephen in the king's seizure of the throne from Henry's daughter Matilda. These early charters from Stephen's reign are Walter's last appearances in documents during his lifetime. Also in 1136 Walter {{was in charge of}} the defense of Le Sap in Normandy against Geoffrey V of Anjou.|$|E
5|$|About 19:45, the 1st Army Group held {{a conference}} in Zagreb, just as German tanks were {{entering}} the city. Nedeljković told Petrović that {{he could no longer}} hold his positions, but despite this, Petrović ordered him to hold for at least 2–3 days to enable the withdrawal of the 7th Army to the Kupa river. Nedeljković replied that he no longer had an army, and suggested that all Serb officers and men be ordered back to form a defensive line along the Sava and Una rivers. Petrović refused to consider this, but ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to form a defensive line along the Sava between Jasenovac and Zagreb. The XLVI Motorised Corps encountered little resistance from the 4th Army, particularly from the 27th Infantry Division Savska and 40th Infantry Division Slavonska on its right, and by the evening of 10 April the whole 4th Army was disintegrating. Petrović wanted to dismiss Marić as commander of the 27th Infantry Division Savska due to suspicions <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> Ustaše sympathiser, but could not identify a suitable replacement.|$|E
5|$|After Edgehill, Rupert asked Charles for a swift cavalry {{attack on}} London before the Earl of Essex's army could return. The King's senior counsellors, however, {{urged him to}} advance slowly on the capital with the whole army. By the time they arrived, the city had {{organised}} defences against them. Some argue that, in delaying, the Royalists had perhaps lost their best chance of winning the war, although others have argued that Rupert's proposed attack would have had trouble penetrating a hostile London. Instead, early in 1643, Rupert began to clear the South-West, taking Cirencester in February before moving further against Bristol, a key port. Rupert took Bristol in July with his brother Maurice using Cornish forces and was appointed Governor of the city. By mid-1643 Rupert had become so well known <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> issue in any potential peace accommodation—Parliament was seeking to see him punished as part of any negotiated solution, {{and the presence of}} Rupert at the court, close to the King during the negotiations, was perceived as a bellicose statement in itself.|$|E
5000|$|Saint Ternan (fifth century?) is venerated as the [...] "Bishop of the Picts." [...] Not much {{is known}} of his life. <b>He</b> may have <b>been</b> consecrated by St. Palladius.
