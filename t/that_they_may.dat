5|$|A nocturnal {{lifestyle}} {{has been}} suggested for the primitive ceratopsian Protoceratops. However, comparisons between the scleral rings of Protoceratops and Psittacosaurus and modern birds and reptiles indicate <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals.|$|E
5|$|Post-Skilling, some {{courts have}} held that gratuities may be reached as kickbacks, while others have held <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not. Prof. Coffee has argued that honest {{services}} fraud doctrine should explicitly distinguish {{between public and private}} corruption.|$|E

5|$|Although {{never truly}} domesticated, {{a small number}} of jungle cats have been found among the cat mummies of Ancient Egypt, dating to 3700 BC. The vast {{majority}} of these are domestic cats, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have been used to help control rodent populations.|$|E
5|$|Although shoe polish is {{primarily}} intended for leather shoes, some brands specify <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> {{be used on}} non-porous materials, such as vinyl. The polish is generally the same colour as the shoes {{it will be used}} upon, or it may be neutral, lacking any intrinsic colour.|$|E
5|$|Another dromaeosaurid species, Deinonychus antirrhopus, may display partial flight capacities. The {{young of}} this species bore longer arms and more robust {{pectoral}} girdles than adults, and which {{were similar to those}} seen in other flapping theropods, implying <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have been capable of flight when young and then lost the ability as they grew.|$|E

5|$|Eventually Eva falls terminally ill.

5|$|Feminist {{jurisprudence}} signifies {{a reaction}} to the philosophical approach of modern legal scholars, who typically see law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals. Feminist legal scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge women's values or legal interests or the harms <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> anticipate or experience.|$|E

5|$|Hume has {{suggested}} that the Mascarene parrots have a common origin in the radiation of the Psittaculini tribe, basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. The Psittaculini may have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea.|$|E

5|$|In most brachiopods, diverticula (hollow extensions) of {{the mantle}} {{penetrate}} through the mineralized {{layers of the}} valves into the periostraca. The function of these diverticula is uncertain and it is suggested <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be storage chambers for chemicals such as glycogen, may secrete repellents to deter organisms that stick to the shell or may help in respiration. Experiments show that a brachiopod's oxygen consumption drops if petroleum jelly is smeared on the shell, clogging the diverticula.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{highlighted}} that this elevation of principles of natural justice to constitutional status, with the implication <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> override local statutes {{due to the}} supremacy of the Constitution over them, creates some tension with Article 38 which vests the law-making power of Singapore in the legislature.|$|E
5|$|Large thin flat mineralized plates {{have been}} found next to the ribs' sides. Their {{function}} is unknown; they {{may have played a}} role in respiration. However, muscle scars or other indications of attachment have not been found for the plates, which argues against a respiratory function. Recent histological study of layered plates from a probable subadult indicates <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have started as cartilage and became bone as the animal aged. Such plates are known from several other ornithopods and their cerapodan relatives.|$|E

5|$|Living asteroids, the Neoasteroidea, are morphologically {{distinct}} from their forerunners in the Paleozoic. The taxonomy {{of the group}} is relatively stable but there is ongoing debate {{about the status of}} the Paxillosida, and the deep-water sea daisies, though clearly Asteroidea and currently included in Velatida, do not fit easily in any accepted lineage. Phylogenetic data suggests <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be a sister group, the Concentricycloidea, to the Neoasteroidea, or that the Velatida themselves may be a sister group.|$|E
