5|$|While 600 Ω is {{an almost}} {{universal}} standard in <b>telephony</b> for local presentation at customer's premises from the exchange, for long distance transmission on trunk lines between exchanges other standard nominal impedances are used and are usually lower, such as 150 Ω.|$|E
5|$|Coimbatore has a well-connected {{communications}} infrastructure. Till the 1990s {{the state}} owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) {{was the only}} telecommunication service provider in the city. In the 1990s, private telecom companies too started offering their services. , BSNL, Reliance Communications, Bharti Airtel and Tata Teleservices offer broadband service and fixed line services. MTS offers mobile broadband services. Cellular <b>telephony</b> was first introduced in 1997 and mobile telephone services available. Coimbatore is {{the headquarters of the}} Tamil Nadu circle of cellular service providers.|$|E
5|$|Image filters. Image filter theory {{grew out}} of {{transmission}} line theory and the design proceeded {{in a similar manner}} to transmission line analysis. For the first time filters could be produced that had precisely controllable passbands and other parameters. These developments took place in the 1920s and filters produced to these designs were still in widespread use in the 1980s, only declining as the use of analogue telecommunications has declined. Their immediate application was the economically important development of frequency division multiplexing for use on intercity and international <b>telephony</b> lines.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{baseband}} pass range {{used was}} 200Hz to 2500Hz but later the International Telecommunication Union {{set a standard}} of 300Hz to 3.4kHz with 4kHz spacing. Thus the filtering was required to go from fully pass to fully stop {{in the space of}} 900Hz. This standard in <b>telephony</b> is still in use today and had remained widespread until it began to be supplanted by digital techniques from the 1980s onwards.|$|E
5|$|Later, Marsh is {{attending}} {{a conference on}} <b>telephony</b> hosted by Alexander Graham Bell; it is here he learns that his USGS expense tab (to {{which he had been}} charging drinks) has been withdrawn, his publication has been suspended, and the fossils he found as part of the USGS are to be returned to the Survey. His colleagues now shun him, the Bone War feud having alienated them, and he is forced to go to Barnum to try to obtain a loan, with the very Mexican antiquities he'd outbid Barnum on before as collateral.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, TouchWave was {{a privately}} held, venture-backed startup company in Palo Alto, California, with future {{entrepreneur}} Oliver Muoto as its marketing director. Co-founded by CEO Bo Larsson, Jeff Snider, David F. Wittenkamp, and Jesper Stroe, TouchWave released its first product, WebSwitch, in 1997. WebSwitch, a Web-based phone switch, provided <b>telephony</b> over IP and targeted small to medium-sized businesses and branch networks of larger organizations. The WebSwitch {{was designed to}} deliver significantly lower costs for communications, ease of management and administration and offered services on a single IP-based network platform. The timing of TouchWave's late 1997 release of its phone switch product matched Level 3's development of its first softswitch, a method to connect calls from one phone line to another without a need to use traditional hardware.|$|E
5|$|On 8 November 1917, No. 2 Wireless School {{was formed}} at Penshurst. It {{operated}} {{a variety of}} aircraft, including Airco DH.6, Avro 504K, Avro 504N, Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c and B.E.2e, Sopwith Camel and Sopwith Snipe. Aircrew attended the school for a one-week-long course in wireless <b>telephony</b> procedures. The school was disbanded on 23 March 1919. Knotley Hall was offered for sale in May 1919. In September 1919, {{it was announced that}} Penshurst had been disposed of by the Royal Air Force, and that it could be considered as an emergency landing ground for civil aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The island made {{communication}} history {{again on}} 8 October 2002, by {{becoming one of}} the first areas of South Wales to link to the Internet through a wireless connection deployed by Cardiff Council as part of the Flat Holm Project. The connection is used for Internet, access to Cardiff Council's data network and VOIP <b>telephony.</b> There are two handsets in the main farmhouse {{that are part of the}} councils own PBX thus having Cardiff dialling codes. 105 years after Marconi, Spencer Pearson an IT Consultant with Cardiff Council made the first telephone call from the island to his office at County Hall, Atlantic Wharf, Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|Wormshill {{retained}} its own telephone exchange until the 1990s, {{when it became}} part of the Maidstone exchange. A red telephone box remains in the village after residents insisted that it not be replaced with a modern design however the <b>telephony</b> was disconnected (and the box sealed) in November 2009 as a result of lack of use. An informal village noticeboard {{is on the side of}} an old flint and wood barn that was part of the former Home Farm. The post box and telephone box are at the same location. The telephone box is a listed building.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in the Austrian Empire, Tesla {{received}} an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in <b>telephony</b> and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.|$|E
5|$|Populations of the {{peregrine}} falcon have bounced back {{in most parts}} of the world. In Britain, there has been a recovery of populations since the crash of the 1960s. This has been greatly assisted by conservation and protection work led by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The RSPB has estimated that there are 1,402 breeding pairs in the UK. Peregrines now breed in many mountainous and coastal areas, especially in the west and north, and nest in some urban areas, capitalising on the urban feral pigeon populations for food. In Southampton, a nest prevented restoration of mobile <b>telephony</b> services for several months, after Vodafone engineers despatched to repair a faulty transmitter mast discovered a nest in the mast, and were prevented by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, on pain of a possible prison sentence, from proceeding with repairs until the chicks fledged. In many parts of the world {{peregrine falcon}}s have adapted to urban habitats, nesting on cathedrals, skyscraper window ledges, tower blocks, and the towers of suspension bridges. Many of these nesting birds are encouraged, sometimes gathering media attention and often monitored by cameras.|$|E

25|$|<b>Telephony</b> denial-of-service {{can exist}} even without Internet <b>telephony.</b> In the 2002 New Hampshire Senate {{election}} phone jamming scandal, telemarketers {{were used to}} flood political opponents with spurious calls to jam phone banks on election day. Widespread publication of a number can also flood it with enough calls to render it unusable, as happened by accident in 1981 with multiple +1-area code-867-5309 subscribers inundated by hundreds of misdialed calls daily {{in response to the}} song 867-5309/Jenny.|$|E

25|$|Virgin Media {{owns and}} {{operates}} its own fibre-optic cable network in the United Kingdom, although currently their optical fibre network does not reach the customer premises but rather a street cabinet. As of 31 December 2012, it had a total of approximately 4.8 million cable customers, of whom around 3.79 million were supplied with its television services (Virgin TV), around 4.2 million with broadband internet services and around 4.1 million with fixed-line <b>telephony</b> services. At the same date, it had around 3 million mobile <b>telephony</b> customers. Virgin Media competes primarily with Sky, BT Group, EE, O2, TalkTalk, Vodafone and Three.|$|E
25|$|The {{governor}} received {{relatively little}} scientific attention until James Clerk Maxwell published a paper that established {{the beginning of}} a theoretical basis for understanding control theory. Development of the electronic amplifier during the 1920s, which was important for long distance <b>telephony,</b> required a higher signal to noise ratio, which was solved by negative feedback noise cancellation. This and other <b>telephony</b> applications contributed to control theory. In the 1940s and 1950s, German mathematician Irmgard Flugge-Lotz developed the theory of discontinuous automatic controls, which found military applications during the Second World War to fire control systems and aircraft navigation systems.|$|E
25|$|Also {{spun out}} of the TEE was the Northern Command School of Bombing, Signalling and <b>Telephony,</b> and Field Engineering, {{commanded}} by Major Burton (see above) {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
25|$|The German {{occupation}} of Norway during World War II (1940–45) caused a heavy wear {{on the radio}} equipment, {{and by the end}} of the war the coast radio network was non-operational. Ørlandet Radio opened in 1952. Norway had twenty-seven coast radio station in 1953, of which five were located in Svalbard and Jan Mayen. Twelve only had a <b>telephony</b> service, while the remainder had both telegraphy and <b>telephony.</b> The maritime VHF radio system was introduced in 1956. Because of the limited range of VHF compared to MF, an additional forty unmanned stations were established, connected with a manned station with relays.|$|E
