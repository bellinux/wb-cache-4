40|$|This paper {{explores the}} views of tenant firms of Malaysia’s <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> on {{knowledge}} transfer among them. The sponsors of <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> assume that <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> {{play a significant role}} in promoting knowledge transfer and innovation through the proximity among the tenants. Personal interviews with t he tenant firms in seven <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> disclose that the tenants appear to be neutral toward the role of <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> in promoting knowledge transfer and innovation. The study therefore suggests it is critically necessary to review the existing policies related to Malaysia’s <b>technology</b> <b>parks.</b> (90 words) ...|$|R
50|$|Business {{incubators}} {{differ from}} research and <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> in their dedication to startup and early-stage companies. Research and <b>technology</b> <b>parks,</b> {{on the other}} hand, tend to be large-scale projects that house everything from corporate, government or university labs to very small companies. Most research and <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> do not offer business assistance services, which are the hallmark of a business incubation program. However, many research and <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> house incubation programs.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to verify the {{development}} of science and <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> in Poland {{as well as the}} opportunities of development of new forms of cooperation with the use of science and <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> in the bio pharmaceutical industry in Poland. The first section reviews the origins and definitions of science and <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> in order to clarify and systematize the concepts used in existing research and practice. Subsequently, the ensuing sections discuss the evolution of science and <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> and different organizational models of STPS. Further, the analysis centres on science and <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> in Poland. Then the importance of science and <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> for the development of new modes of cooperation in the bio pharmaceutical industry is elaborated upon.

5|$|After the war {{four more}} gaseous {{diffusion}} plants {{were added to}} the site, named K-27, K-29, K-31 and K-33. The K-25 site was renamed the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant in 1955. Production of enriched uranium ended in 1964, and gaseous diffusion finally ceased on the site on 27 August 1985. The Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant was renamed the Oak Ridge K-25 Site in 1989, and the East Tennessee <b>Technology</b> <b>Park</b> in 1996.

5|$|In 2011, {{the minimum}} age for contestants to {{audition}} {{was changed to}} 14 years old, having previously been 16 years old.

The successful auditionees chosen by the producers were then invited back to the last set of auditions that took place in front of the judges and a live studio audience. These auditions were held in three cities: Brisbane (Brisbane Entertainment Centre, 21–22 May), Melbourne (Hisense Arena, 27–29 May), and Sydney (Sydney Entertainment Centre, 2–3 June).|$|E
5|$|The overall {{infrastructure}} of Malaysia {{is one of}} the most developed in Asia and ranked 8th in Asia and 25th in the world. Malaysia is ranked 19th in the world for its quality roads, quality of port infrastructure and quality of air transport infrastructure but ranked 39th in quality of electricity supply. Its telecommunications network is second only to Singapore's in Southeast Asia, with 4.7million fixed-line subscribers and more than 30million cellular subscribers. The country has seven international ports, the major one being the Port Klang. There are 200 industrial parks along with specialised parks such as <b>Technology</b> <b>Park</b> Malaysia and Kulim Hi-Tech Park. Fresh water is available to over 95 per cent of the population. During the colonial period, development was mainly concentrated in economically powerful cities and in areas forming security concerns. Although rural areas have been the focus of great development, they still lag behind areas such as the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The telecommunication network, although strong in urban areas, is less available to the rural population.|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of global scale competition is leading towards {{the development of}} new mechanisms to help countries to become more competitive and <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> are the vehicle of choice to achieve that. <b>Technology</b> <b>Parks</b> offer modern infrastructure and integrated info-structure to promote research and technology development and commercialization for wealth creation and sustainable economic growth and Global Competitiveness. This paper discusses the position of <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> in East Asia; elaborates on their role in today’s nation development, analytically examines three selected <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore using GCI Index 2015 and concludes that <b>Technology</b> <b>parks</b> have contributed to gross domestic product (GDP) growth, infrastructure development, knowledge community expansion, capacity building, and export production and distribution. However, optimum benefits of <b>Technology</b> <b>Parks</b> accrue when they are established and managed professionally in line with the best practices and all transactions are equitable, just, and transparent; the whole process must culminate trust nationally and internationally...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to explore the}} views of key ICT stakeholders {{on the role of}} <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> in promoting innovation via knowledge transfer. Many developed and developing countries use <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> as an instrument to promote knowledge transfer and innovation. Policy makers incor-porate this idea into public policy for science and technology. The study observes that Malaysia’s <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> have played a little role in promoting knowledge transfer and innovation because ICT enterprises located thereon operate on a different premise. The study suggests the government to review the policy on <b>technology</b> <b>parks</b> with the objective to intensify innovation in Malaysia’s ICT industry...|$|R
