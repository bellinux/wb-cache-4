40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an underactuated gripper designed <b>to</b> <b>unlatch</b> doors knobs and handles. The challenge was to create a mechanism that could manipulate a variety of door knobs and handles while using only one motor {{in order to create a}} low cost device. The final design evolved by exploring the limitations in the performance of an initial gripper prototype. In this paper, the cause of failure for the first prototype is discussed along with rationale for the changes made in the second design. The final design was capable of twisting door knobs and handles in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. It had a collet-cone shape for compliance gripping and centering, and it utilized one motor for both gripping and twisting actions. The discussed gripper was developed for the assistive technology domain; however, this gripper mechanism could be utilized in a wide variety of robotic domains that exist today. 1...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the effects of {{excessive}} sonication during surfactant-assisted multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) dispersion in ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) by way of monitoring molecular arrangements upon progressive straining. Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy confirms the structural damage on the graphitic layers upon prolonged sonication. The resulting lack on MWCNT alignment is shown by atomic force microscopy. Further, molecular interface dynamics in progressively strained EVA|MWCNT composites have been studied through Raman and NEXAFS spectroscopies. NEXAFS spectra have identified graphitic amorphization and further C-vacancy rehybridization by way of hydrogen passivation as the damage mechanism to the graphitic structure upon sonication. In this scheme, MWCNTs did not align despite the range of composite strains discussed due to stick and slip dynamics of surrounding EVA. Ultimately, damaged MWCNTs rendered the necessary dispersant Ï�â��Ï� interactions suboptimal and insufficient for nanomechanically interlocked polymerâ��filler interactions. Remarkably, upon large strains, polymer chains are seen <b>to</b> <b>unlatch</b> from the MWCNT and undergo mechanically induced backbone twisting.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringInertial {{release of}} the RCF- 67 side release buckle is {{investigated}} in this thesis through review of the literature, finite element modeling, and experimental testing. A finite element (FE) model is developed using the explicit non-linear finite element code LS-DYNA. The propensity of the buckle <b>to</b> <b>unlatch</b> under various combinations of acceleration pulse amplitudes, durations, and belt tension is simulated and profiled. The non-linear modal response of the spring {{is found to be}} significant contributor. The results are correlated and compared against experimental test data within the literature. Rate sensitive foam is added to the buckle model to demonstrate prevention of inertial release through addition of a damping element. The FE model predicts the performance of the buckle with high fidelity and granularity {{both before and after the}} rate sensitive foam is added. Laboratory impact sled testing is performed on both configurations to further corroborate the results of the model. A "whipping" effect is observed in the buckle housing acceleration data and high speed video which causes oscillation in the acceleration of the housing, where peak accelerations are also higher and pulse durations are longer measured at the buckle CG compared to those measured on the rigid mounting structure. The wealth of experimental and computational data found in the literature, combined with that obtained in this study, allows for insightful conclusions to be drawn regarding the unlatching potential of the RCF- 67 buckle as well as the effectiveness of adding rate sensitive foam to this buckle design. This modification to add damping provides a simple, inexpensive, and effective means of rendering a seat belt buckle safe under severe crash conditions where it may not otherwise perform as intended. Applicability to automotive seat belt buckle design in general is expanded on. LS-DYNA and the associated methodology used in this study proves effective in analyzing a buckle design for prevention of inertial release based on limited test data...|$|E
40|$|The {{techniques}} {{used in the}} fabrication of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) were adopted from the integrated circuits (IC) industry and are mostly limited to patterning thin films on a flat substrate. As a consequence, micro-machined devices mostly comprise sets of flat two-dimensional (2 D) membranes with etched patterns and undercuts {{that enable them to}} serve their intended functions. However, many mechanical, optical and biological applications, such as corner-cube retro reflectors, micro-scale magnetometers, 3 D microfluidic systems and 3 D photonic crystals, require three-dimensional (3 D) geometries for their functionality. In addition, 3 D circuits have also emerged as a way of improving connectivity and reducing power dissipation in electronic chips. However, the creation of fully 3 D structures via conventional MEMS fabrication techniques typically requires processes that have low throughput, limited control over the final geometry, and higher costs. A promising alternative to 3 D microfabrication that addresses these challenges while requiring minimal investment in a new infrastructure is to use the existing technologies to pattern in 2 D, and then assemble the patterned segments into 3 D structures. Demonstrated methods to achieve that objective have been limited in scope, requiring manual assembly or with limited applicability to specific architectures. This thesis presents a coherent modular system for folding, aligning and latching 2 D-patterned precursors into prescribed 3 D structures. The system presented here comprises flexure hinges to enable relative motion among the 2 D precursors, a cascaded alignment system to provide progressively better alignment among precursors as they approach their final positions, and systems of reversible latches to retain the assembly in its final configuration while, optionally, permitting disassembly and reassembly of the structure. In particular, two types of systems are considered. First, the design, fabrication and testing of polymer structures with metal hinges, cascaded alignment features and integrated latching mechanisms are presented for perpendicular assembly of structures. Second, an alternative latching technique using controlled melting of photoresist polymer adhesive pads is analyzed and tested for the parallel assembly of structures. The structures discussed in this thesis consist of SU- 8 polymer segments patterned on silicon wafers and linked with an underlying thin gold pattern that defines the hinges. The elasto-plastic bending of the hinges is analyzed and simulated to predict the trajectory and angular position of the membranes during folding. The design of cascaded alignment features, consisting of triangular protrusions and corresponding rhombic holes, is discussed. A kinematic model of the alignment mechanism is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the cascading aspect of the design to achieve a large range of angular correction and high alignment accuracy at the same time. The design of micro snap-fit latches that work in conjunction with the alignment system is also presented, and quasi-static simulations of the elastic bending of latches is used to evaluate their strength. Experimental measurements were conducted to characterize the behavior of the gold hinges during bending, demonstrating good agreement with models. The integrated folding-alignment-latching system was demonstrated by assembling corner-cube structures. The alignment process was found to be accurate to within 1 from measurements of the final assembled position of the corner cube structure. The system was also shown to support fabricating reconfigurable devices by demonstrating the ability <b>to</b> <b>unlatch</b> and re-latch segments. The latching and unlatching forces were measured to be 9. 7 [mu]N and 12. 3 [mu]N respectively. by Nader S. Shaar. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|Period (PER) is {{the major}} {{transcription}} inhibitor in metazoan circadian clocks and lies {{at the center of}} several feedback loops that regulate gene expression. Dimerization of Drosophila PER influences nuclear translocation, repressor activity, and behavioral rhythms. The structure of a central, 346 -residue PER fragment reveals two associated PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domains followed by a protruding α-helical extension (αF). A closed, pseudosymmetric dimer forms from a cross handshake interaction of the N-terminal PAS domain with αF of the opposing subunit. Strikingly, a shift of αF against the PAS β-sheet generates two alternative subunit interfaces in the dimer. Taken together with a previously reported PER structure in which αF extends, these data indicate that αF <b>unlatches</b> <b>to</b> switch association of PER with itself to its partner Timeless.

40|$|Actin {{remodeling}} {{is a key}} step in many cellular processes. Adseverin and gelsolin are calcium dependent actin remodeling {{proteins in}} gelsolin superfamily. Gelsolin is involved in cell motility whereas adseverin participates in cell secretion. Gelsolin has a C-terminal extension that forms an a-helix, which covers an F-actin-binding site {{in the absence of}} calcium. Equilibrium dialysis experiments suggest that adseverin has one rate-limiting step during activation with respect to actin severing whereas gelsolin has two rate-limiting steps. The second rate-limiting step of gelsolin has been attributed <b>to</b> the <b>unlatching</b> of the C-terminal helix. However, the details of the calcium activation of adseverin and gelsolin remain unclear. Results presented in this study have demonstrated that in solution adseverindisplays different conformations fromgelsolin. However, the calcium induced conformational changes of these proteins are similar. The N-terminal half of adseverin displays an inactive conformation in the absence of calcium that is activated by calcium binding at A 3. Calcium binding at the calcium-binding site straightens the long helix that disruptsthe key interactions at the A 1 :A 3 interface (R 97 -E 314 and F 64 -M 310), which is unnecessary for gelsolin. Calcium activation at the C-terminal half of adseverin involves domains rearrangement induced by cooperative calcium binding at A 4 and AS but A 6. However calcium binding at A 6 is key to the activation of the full-length molecule. Moreover actin filament depolymerization assay suggests that the C-terminal half may present actin filament severing activity in the present of calcium. Results in the thesis have provided insights into the details of calcium activation of adseverin providing mechanistic explanations to such questions as, "Why does adseverin require less calcium than gelsolin in inducing severing activity?" "Why is actin filament severing activity by the N-terminus of adseverin calcium dependent whereas it is calcium independent in gelsolin?" Moreover the results have helped explain the common mechanism of calcium activation of the C- terminal half of adseverin and gelsolin. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
