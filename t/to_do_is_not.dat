He {{noted that}} by rearranging equipment—and often keeping the same setup for around just five minutes—it {{allowed him to}} explore more writing possibilities; he said [...] "that will achieve some sort of purpose, so the way I've wired it together becomes the track in itself." [...] James also explained that when composing the [...] "logical thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> change anything and just do another one using {{the same set of}} sounds", but during Syros recording sessions he would often [...] "get bored and swap things out".|$|E
500|$|Lord Carteret read {{passages}} from the fourth letter about Irish constitutional independence to the Irish Privy Council and claimed that they were treasonable. It was then that Harding was arrested for printing the letters and a reward of £300 was offered for {{the identity of the}} Drapier. Lord Carteret wrote that the arrest and bounty were the result of an [...] "unfortunate accident" [...] and {{he did not want to}} respond in such a way. Lord Midleton was also forced to denounce his previous ally, the Drapier, when did so when he wrote, [...] "to provoke England to that degree as some have endeavoured <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the true way to keep them out". Archbishop King responded to the letters by saying they were [...] "ludicrous and satyrically writ". However, the Archbishop publicly supported the constitutional actions more than the other three, and his support caused others important officials to criticise him.|$|E
500|$|Disney then {{assigned}} Larry Clemmons as his new {{writer and}} one of the four story men for the film, giving Clemmons a copy of Kipling's book, and telling him: [...] "The first thing I want you <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to read it." [...] Clemmons still looked at the novel, and thought it was too disjointed and without continuity, needing adaptations to fit a film script. Clemmons wanted to start in medias res, with some flashbacks afterwards, but then Disney said to focus on doing the storyline more straight - [...] "Let's do the meat of the picture. Let's establish the characters. Let's have fun with it.". Although much of Bill Peet's work was discarded, the personalities of the characters remained in the final film. This was because Disney felt that the story should be kept simple, and the characters should drive the story. Disney took {{an active role in the}} story meetings, acting out each role and helping to explore the emotions of the characters, help create gags and develop emotional sequences. Clemmons would write a rough script with an outline for most sequences. The story artists then discussed how to fill the scenes, including the comedic gags to employ. The script also tried to incorporate how the voice actors molded their characters and interacted with each other. The Jungle Book also marks the last animated film from the company to have Disney's personal touches, before his death on December 15, 1966.|$|E

An apology for slavery would be appropriate but not particularly helpful in improving the lives of African Americans, he said. Reparations could also be a distraction, Obama said. [...] "I consistently believe {{that when it comes to}} whether it's Native Americans or African-American issues or reparations, the most important thing for the U.S. government <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> just offer words, but offer deeds," [...] Obama told a meeting in Chicago in July 2008.|$|E

In {{reading the}} Scriptures, and, indeed, in {{all forms of}} giving {{religious}} counsel or instruction, we must generally beware of presenting the thoughts that we communicate {{in the form of}} reproachful personal application. There may be exceptions to this rule, but it is undoubtedly, in general, a sound one. For the work which we have <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to attempt to drive the heart from the wrong to the right by any repellent action which the wrong may be made to exert, but to allure it by an attractive action with which the right may be invested. We must, therefore, present the incidents and instructions of the Word in their alluring aspect--assuming, in a great measure, that our little pupil will feel pleasure with us in the manifestations of the right, and will sympathize with us in disapproval of the wrong. To secure them to our side, in the views which we take, we must show a disposition to take them to it by an affectionate sympathy.|$|E

So you see there's no doubt the offer is made to every one who will; and then it is written that the Holy Spirit is able to make us willing.
