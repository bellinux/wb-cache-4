40|$|Abstract. Successful {{inoculation}} is {{not guaranteed}} and effects {{may even be}} deleterious. The main risks are the appearance of <b>types</b> <b>B</b> and D <b>graphite,</b> associated with ferrite and/or carbides {{due to lack of}} control of undercooling during eutectic solidification. Alternatively coarse type C graphite in hypo to eutectic grey irons may result from inadequate or excessive inoculation. Sulphur and aluminium content in a molten iron are considered to be the main factors to control the degree of eutectic undercooling, graphite morphology and inoculation efficiency. Thermal conditions, such as superheating, inoculation and pouring temperature {{play an important role in}} controlling these effects. Cooling rates due to different mould materials and casting thickness were also considered. In order to resolve individual problems, different inoculant systems have to be considered, such as Sr-FeSi, Ca-FeSi, Ti,Ca-FeSi, Zr,Ca-FeSi, Ba,Ca-FeSi, RE-FeSi (Ca). The present paper made a synthesis of other published papers by the authors, but also added many original un-published results...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{prognostic}} {{relevance of}} subtypes within <b>type</b> <b>B</b> thymomas is controversial. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the utility of World Health Organization (WHO) classification in patients with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> thymoma. MethodsThis was a retrospective review of 100 patients who underwent thymectomy for WHO <b>type</b> <b>B</b> thymoma. Recurrence patterns and survival were compared among subtypes. ResultsThere were 22 <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 1 tumors, 43 <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 2 tumors, and 35 <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 3 tumors. Incomplete resection occurred in 5 patients with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 1 thymoma, 8 with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 2 thymoma, and 8 with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 3 thymoma (P = . 87). Of the 79 patients with complete resection, tumor recurrence occurred in 1 (5. 9 %) patient with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 1 thymoma, 2 (5. 7 %) with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 2 thymoma, and 2 (7. 4 %) with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 3 thymoma, and all of these patients had Masaoka stage III disease. Disease-free survival at 5 years was 93 %, 85 %, and 82 % in <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 1, B 2, and B 3, respectively (B 1 vs B 2; P =. 79; B 2 vs B 3; P = 0. 6).

ConclusionsTumor recurrence was significantly associated with advanced Masaoka stage regardless of the WHO subtype of <b>type</b> <b>B</b> thymomas. Given the heterogeneity of WHO <b>type</b> <b>B</b> thymomas, Masaoka stage should always be considered when predicting prognosis and planning adjuvant treatment for patients with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> thymomas...|$|R
