50|$|Retail banking, {{also known}} as {{consumer}} banking, is the provision of services by a bank to individual consumers, rather than to companies, corporations or other banks. Services offered include savings and <b>transactional</b> <b>accounts,</b> mortgages, personal loans, debit cards, and credit cards. The term is generally used to distinguish these banking services from investment banking, commercial banking or wholesale banking. It may {{also be used to}} refer to a division or department of a bank dealing with retail customers.|$|E
50|$|Unlike savings accounts, {{for which}} {{the primary reason for}} {{depositing}} money is to generate interest, the main function of a <b>transactional</b> <b>account</b> is <b>transactional.</b> Therefore, most providers either pay no interest or pay a low level of interest on credit balances.|$|R

50|$|A {{current account}} is {{the form of}} <b>transactional</b> <b>account</b> found in the United Kingdom and other {{countries}} with a UK banking heritage; a current account offers various flexible payment methods to allow customers to distribute money directly to others. Most current accounts come with a cheque book and offer the facility to arrange standing orders, direct debits and payment via a debit card. Current accounts may also allow borrowing via an overdraft facility. One of the main differences between a UK current account and an American checking account is that they earn considerable interest, sometimes comparable to a savings account, and there is generally no charge for withdrawals at cashpoints (ATMs), other than charges by third party owners of such machines.|$|R

Customers who are noted to obtain cash back frequently are also investigated by the corporation to observe patterns.|$|R
50|$|In premodern China, {{the need}} for credit and for {{circulating}} a medium that was less of a burden than exchanging thousands of copper coins led {{to the introduction of}} paper money, commonly known today as banknotes. This economic phenomenon was a slow and gradual process that took place from the late Tang Dynasty (618-907) into the Song Dynasty (960-1279). It began as a means for merchants to exchange heavy coinage for receipts of deposit issued as promissory notes from shops of wholesalers, notes that were valid for temporary use in a small regional territory. In the 10th century, the Song Dynasty government began circulating these notes amongst the traders in their monopolized salt industry. The Song government granted several shops the sole right to issue banknotes, and in the early 12th century the government finally took over these shops to produce state-issued currency. Yet the banknotes issued were still regionally valid and temporary; {{it was not until the}} mid 13th century that a standard and uniform government issue of paper money was made into an acceptable nationwide currency. The already widespread methods of woodblock printing and then Pi Sheng's movable type printing by the 11th century was the impetus for the massive production of paper money in premodern China.At around the same time in the medieval Islamic world, a vigorous monetary economy was created during the 7th-12th centuries on the basis of the expanding levels of circulation of a stable high-value currency (the dinar). Innovations introduced by Muslim economists, traders and merchants include the earliest uses of credit, cheques, promissory notes, savings accounts, <b>transactional</b> <b>accounts,</b> loaning, trusts, exchange rates, the transfer of credit and debt, and banking institutions for loans and deposits.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- Retail banking {{is when a}} bank executes {{transactions}} {{directly with}} consumers, rather than corporations or other banks. Services offered include savings and <b>transactional</b> <b>accounts,</b> mortgages, personal loans, debit cards, and cards. Today, retail banking is being considered {{as one of the}} most innovative financial services provided by the various commercial Public Sector Banks (PSBs), private sector and foreign banks. Retail banking has a huge potential considering the growing demand for its products namely, term deposits, consumer durable loans, auto loans, debit card, credit cards, ATM facilities, insurance, online banking, etc. The growing sector of retail lending has contributed significantly to the development of the economy. Like other developed countries, India too, has a developed retail banking sector which accounts for one-fifth of all banks credit. Retail lending across the globe has been a showcase of innovative services in the commercial banking sector. Countries, like China and India, have emerged as potential markets with changing investment opportunities. The higher growth of retail lending in emerging economies can be attributed to the rapid growth of personal wealth, favorable demographic profile, rapid development in information technology, the conducive macroeconomic environment, financial market reforms and small micro-level supply side factors. The retail banking strategies of banks are undergoing a major transformation, as banks are beginning to adopt a mix of strategies like organic growth acquisition and alliance formation. This has resulted in a paradigm shift in the marketing strategies of the banks. PSBs are adopting aggressive strategies, leveraging their branch network to garner a large share of the retail market. This article attempts to highlight the prospects and the future role of retail banking in India. Retail banking is widely recognized as an important factor for the economic development of a country.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{a defense of}} {{backwards}} in time causation models in quantum mechanics. Particular attention is given to Cramer 2 ̆ 7 s <b>transactional</b> <b>account,</b> which is shown to have the threefold virtue of solving the Bell problem, explaining the complex conjugate aspect of the quantum mechanical formalism, and explaining various quantum mysteries such as Schrodinger 2 ̆ 7 s cat. The question is therefore asked, why has this model not received more attention from physicists and philosophers? One objection given by physicists in assessing Cramer 2 ̆ 7 s theory was {{that it is not}} testable. This paper seeks to answer this concern by utilizing an argument that backwards causation models entail a fork theory of causal direction. From the backwards causation model together with the fork theory one can deduce empirical predictions. Finally, the objection that this strategy is questionable because of its appeal to philosophy is deflected...|$|R

It has also been used by those who have some genuine funds in interest-bearing accounts, but who artificially inflate their balances in order to increase the interest paid by their banks. In recent years, criminals have started taking advantage of the check float to pass fraud checks through solicited users of online auctions.|$|R
40|$|In Mexico, {{the share}} of adults that have a {{regulated}} transaction account is low, even {{when compared to other}} countries of similar income levels. Traditionally, this problem has been regarded as a phenomenon of «involuntary exclusion», in which excluded individuals wish to use this service but face a number of barriers, among which those related to costs are the most relevant. Thus, public policies have focused on reducing costs. On the other hand, little {{attention has been paid to}} individuals that seemingly have decided not to use these accounts. Even if they do not face significant barriers to access the accounts, they prefer using non-regulated transactional services, or make and receive payments in cash only and keep cash surpluses at home. In this paper the phenomenon of «self-exclusion» is analyzed. It concludes that cost barriers only partially explain exclusion in the context of <b>transactional</b> bank <b>accounts.</b> Such exclusion also reflects the prevalence of informal economic relationships, which reduces the value proposition of <b>transactional</b> bank <b>accounts</b> to end users...|$|R

This seriously weakened the position of Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, a Grand Duke of Bosnia, whose niece Katarina was a second wife of Sandalj Hranić, a Grand Duke of Hum. In such circumstances Sandalj decided to ally with emperor Sigismund in mid 1411 and to establish closer connections with Sigismund's important ally Stefan Lazarević. In December 1411 Sandalj divorced his wife Katarina and married Stefan's sister Jelena {{at the end of}} the same year. Jelena married Sandalj because she wanted to strengthen the position of her son. With this marriage Sandalj, the most dangerous enemy of Balša III, became his stepfather and protector. Although it spoiled Sandalj's relations with Hrvoje, it also strengthened traditionally close relations with the Lazarević family.
