5|$|The duality between Eulerian and bipartite planar graphs can be {{extended}} to binary matroids (which include the graphic matroids derived from planar graphs): a binary matroid is Eulerian {{if and only if}} its dual matroid is bipartite.

5|$|An {{example of}} this type of {{decomposition}} into interdigitating trees can be seen in some simple types of mazes, with a single entrance and no disconnected components of its walls. In this case both the maze walls and the space between the walls {{take the form of a}} mathematical tree. If the free space of the maze is partitioned into simple cells (such as the squares of a grid) then this system of cells can be viewed as an embedding of a planar graph, in which the tree structure of the walls forms a spanning tree of the graph and the tree structure of the free space forms a spanning tree of <b>the</b> <b>dual</b> graph. Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of streams and rivers within a drainage basin and <b>the</b> <b>dual</b> tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.|$|E
