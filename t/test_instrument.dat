2500|$|The USAF Air Materiel Command {{reactivated}} the JB-2 as Project EO-727-12 on 23 April 1948, at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, {{the former}} Alamogordo Army Air Field. The JB-2 {{was used for}} development of missile guidance control and seeker systems, testing of telemetering and optical tracking facilities, and as a target for new surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles (fulfilling the V1's covername, Flakzielgerät— anti-aircraft target device). The JB-2 project used the North American Aviation NATIV (North American <b>Test</b> <b>Instrument</b> Vehicle) Blockhouse and two launch ramps at Holloman: a , two-rail ramp on a 3° earth-filled slope, and a [...] trailer ramp. The trailer ramp {{was the first step}} toward a system which would eventually be adapted for the forthcoming Martin MGM-1 Matador, the first operational surface-to-surface cruise missile built by the United States. The program at Holloman was terminated on 10 January 1949 after successful development of a radio guidance and control system that could control and even skid-land a JB-2 under the control of an airborne or ground transmitter.|$|E

30|$|Given the {{limitations}} we describe, the existing body of terrestrial literature regarding thermal decomposition behavior of minerals {{is still a}} useful starting point for additional study. When data are returned from Mars, they {{can be compared to}} terrestrial data that inform the selection of minerals to be run in <b>testbed</b> <b>instruments.</b> To best reproduce results obtained on Mars, these <b>testbed</b> <b>instruments</b> will need to have run the same (or very similar) samples that were run in flight (FM) or engineering qualifying models (EQM) of the instruments on Mars. Since each flight instrument is essentially unique (with perhaps the exception of an EQM) and imitating the exact Mars/spacecraft environment is difficult at best, reproducing the exact instrument conditions in the lab is not feasible. By running the same samples in <b>testbed</b> <b>instruments</b> that were run in FM or EQMs, the differences in decomposition behavior can be measured and explained, allowing for more confident identification of unknown minerals measured in situ. Fortunately, the SAM instrument carries a known mineral standard (calcite) that will be measured on Mars. This measurement will be invaluable in calibrating <b>testbed</b> <b>instruments</b> that will attempt to reproduce the results obtained on Mars to identify unknown minerals.|$|R

40|$|Background. Our {{aim was to}} {{determine}} the incidence of hip fractures within two years after stroke, to identify associated factors, to evaluate which <b>test</b> <b>instruments</b> that best could identify people at risk, and to describe the circumstances that prevailed when they sustained their hip fractures. Method. A total of 377 persons with first-ever stroke were followed up for a 24 -month period. Stroke severity, cognition, and associated medical conditions were registered. The following <b>test</b> <b>instruments</b> were used: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up & Go, and Stops Walking When Talking. Result. Sixteen of the persons fractured their hip within the study period, which corresponds to an incidence of 32 hip fractures per 1000 person-years. Persons with fractures more often had impaired vision and cognitive impairment and more had had previous fractures. Of the investigated <b>test</b> <b>instruments,</b> Timed Up & Go was the best test to predict fractures. Conclusion. The incidence of hip fractures in persons with stroke was high in this study. Persons with previous fractures, and visual and cognitive defects are at the greatest risk. Certain <b>test</b> <b>instruments</b> could be used in order to find people at risk, which should be targeted for fall preventive measures...|$|R

40|$|The most {{important}} factor for designs in which friction materials are used is the coefficient of friction. The coefficient of friction has been determined taking such variants as velocity, temperature, and pressure into account, which arise from various factors in friction materials, and by analyzing {{the effects of these}} variants on friction materials. Many <b>test</b> <b>instruments</b> have been produced {{in order to determine the}} coefficient of friction. In this article, a study about the use of machine learning algorithms instead of <b>test</b> <b>instruments</b> in order to determine the coefficient of friction is presented. Isotonic regression was selected as the machine learning method in determining the coefficient of friction. The correlation coefficient between the results of isotonic regression algorithms and the results taken from the <b>test</b> <b>instruments</b> was measured as 0. 9999 and the root mean squared error was 0. 0014 in the experiments conducted. Selection of the number of optimum samples was enabled by taking bias–variance tradeoff into account, and this increased the performance of the classifier in use. The target of this study was to prevent the practice of time-consuming test activities by using machine learning methods instead of <b>test</b> <b>instruments</b> in determining the friction coefficient.
