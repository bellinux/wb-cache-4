5000|$|A new [...] "L" [...] {{designation}} {{was used}} for extended-wheelbase Town Cars from 2000 to 2011. The L editions offered an additional 6 in of rear-seat legroom, as well as remote access audio and climate controls mounted in the rear center armrest. Also included was a two-way <b>travel</b> <b>switch</b> for {{the front passenger seat}} base (a feature shared with the extended-wheelbase Jaguar XJ). This L designation was similar to that used on other luxury flagship sedans such as the BMW 7-Series or the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The L designation was applied to the top-of-line Cartier (2000-2003), Ultimate (2004 only), and Signature (2005-2011) trim levels. Fleet buyers received it under the Executive L trim designation.|$|E

30|$|The {{loading and}} {{unloading}} detection system mainly detects the position change of the seedling plate from the seedling storage mechanism to the seedling plate conveyor belt and obtains the position signal as the action control signal of {{loading and unloading}}. The system includes PVDF pressure sensor, <b>travel</b> <b>switch,</b> limit sensor, and a single lamp. The PVDF pressure sensor is arranged {{in the middle of}} the slot wheel-type seedling storage tray and is in the same vertical plane with the push rod mechanism, which is used to detect whether the seedling storage tray is empty or not. It also lights the single lamp and instructs the start of the sprocket drive motor. The stroke switch mainly detects the displacement of the sprocket drive of the seedling storage tray and determines whether the seedling storage tray reaches the feeding position. Its signal is used to instruct the push rod mechanism to push the seedling tray to the conveyor belt. The limit sensor is installed at the starting position of the conveyor belt, and its signal is used to control the reset action of the pushing mechanism.|$|E
40|$|The {{raising of}} bridge tolls in the peak period on the San Francisco– Oakland Bay Bridge in California in mid- 2010 {{provides}} {{a rare opportunity}} to assess traffic impacts. Carpoolers who previously traveled for free during peak hours were charged an electronic toll under this variable pricing scheme. On the basis of 29 months of time series data, the introduction of carpool charges had a stronger impact on traffic volumes than did peak period pricing of regular traffic. The estimated short-term elasticity of about � 0. 30 suggests significant numbers of peak hour carpoolers did not <b>travel,</b> <b>switched</b> routes, shifted to public transit, or opted to drive alone. More than half the loss in carpool traffic was estimated to be attributable to the toll increase, a far stronger influence than factors such as rising gasoline prices and unemployment.

40|$|The runway {{configuration}} management (RCM) problem governs what combinations of airport runways are in use {{at a given}} time, and to what capacity. Runway configurations (groupings of runways) operate under {{runway configuration}} capacity envelopes (RCCEs) which limit arrival and departure capacities. The RCCE identifies unique capacity constraints based on which tarmacs are used for arrivals, departures, or both, and their direction of <b>travel.</b> When <b>switching</b> between RCCEs, some decrement in arrival and departure capacities is incurred by the transition. A previous RCM model (Frankovich et al., 2009) accounted for this cost through a required period of inactivity. In this paper, we instead focus on the introduction and assessment of a model capable of marginally decreasing RCCE capacities during configuration transitions. A transition penalty matrix is introduced, specifying the relative costs (in terms of accepted arrival and departure capacities) for switching between RCCEs. The new model benefits from customizable transition penalties which more closely represent real-world conditions, at a reasonable computational cost...|$|R

40|$|A dynamic traffic {{assignment}} (DTA) model typically {{consists of a}} traffic performance model and a route choice model. The traffic performance model describes how traffic propagates (over time) along routes connecting origin-destination (OD) pairs, examples being the cell transmission model, the vertical queueing model and the travel time model. This is implemented in a dynamic network loading (DNL) algorithm, which uses the given route inflows to compute the link inflows (and hence link costs), which are then used to compute the route travel times (and hence route costs). A route swap process specifies the route inflows for tomorrow (at the next iteration) based on the route inflows today (at the current iteration). A dynamic user equilibrium (DUE), where each traveller on the network cannot reduce his or her cost of <b>travel</b> by <b>switching</b> to another route, can be sought by iterating between the DNL algorithm and the route swap process. The route swap process itself takes up very little computational time (although route set generation can be very computationally intensive for large networks). However, the choice of route swap process dramatically affects convergence and the speed of convergence. The paper details several route swap processes and considers whether they lead to a convergent system, assuming that the route cost vector is a monotone function of the route inflow vector.

Optimal sequence of operations and associated cutting speeds, which reduce the overall processing cost of these hole-making operations are essential to reach desirable products. In order to achieve this, an attempt is made by developing an effective methodology. An example of the injection mould is considered to demonstrate the proposed approach.

This paper considers the types of travel reduction strategy available, {{in terms of the}} implicit mechanisms of switching or substitution by which travel would be modified or reduced, and evaluates their potential impacts by means of four case studies in European cities. It is found that the various travel reduction strategies have had qualified success. The strategies to some extent achieve reduction in car <b>travel,</b> mainly through <b>switching</b> to other modes, although also through reduced travel distance. However, the scale of the reduction is relatively small and may be offset by new traffic generation. In addition, in some cases the objectives of the measures, although potentially having a travel reduction contribution, are not always aimed directly at travel reduction as such, and therefore {{may not be able to}} deliver the intended travel reduction. The paper concludes that the way forward would appear to lie in setting clear policy objectives and in assembling travel reduction measures into strategy packages, ensuring that when combined the measures are complementary towards the policy objectives of travel reduction. ...|$|R

Tool <b>travel</b> and tool <b>switch</b> planning {{are the two}} major issues in hole-making operations. Many industrial applications such as moulds, dies, engine block, automotive parts etc. requires machining of large number of holes.
