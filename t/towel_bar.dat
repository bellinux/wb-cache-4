Quagmire even {{tries to}} shout down the ventilation, but Meg cannot hear them {{because she is}} listening to a wilderness survival tape {{on what to do}} if a bear appears in front of someone. An enraged Peter orders Lois to let them go, but when she refuses to budge, they pressure her by threatening to defecate on her wedding dress. Irate, Lois takes the hand <b>towel</b> <b>bar</b> from the bathroom at the time when Meg was listening to a wilderness survival tape {{on how to deal with}} snake bites. Lois then uses it to have them escape the attic where they fall near her, but Cleveland tells her that she was too late to stop them from pooping on her dress. Either way, Peter and Lois agree that they both went a little too far. Quagmire states that he will need to take a break from his friendship with the guys for the next two weeks.|$|E

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of an OMV docking mechanism, {{based on an}} adaptation of the Shuttle Flight Support System Pallet Berthing Mechanism was completed. The mechanism uses automatically actuated motorized latches to engage towel bars on the target satellite. LED sensors establish the <b>towel</b> <b>bar</b> position within the capture envelope and the latch capture commands are issued. Then, locking pawls engage the bar, locking and pre-loading the mechanism. Two series of tests were conducted to test nominal and failure mode captures and to evaluate design parameters such as LED sensor locations, automatic closure algorithms, latch closure velocity, position/velocity entry envelopes, and closure method. The first test series involved single latch testing on the Flat Floor Facility, the 6 DOF Facility, and an analytic simulation model. The intent was to compare results in order to validate the various facilities. Reasonably good agreement was achieved. The second test series repeated the single latch testing on the refurbished 6 DOF Facility to validate the facility modifications. The individual latches were tested under free-drift conditions for functionality and performance. Next, the three-latch configuration underwent parametric testing. Test results validated the improved fidelity of the 6 DOF Facility and verified successful docking at the required entry velocity. The tests determined the 'best' design parameter definitions {{and concluded that the}} locking pawls should not lock until all three latches completely close...|$|E

50|$|Blocking, {{often called}} backing or {{sometimes}} grounds, also refers to {{pieces of wood}} or other material that run between wall studs {{in order to provide}} support and attachment sites for mounted hardware or trim such as cabinets, shelving, handrails, vanity tops without a cabinet underneath, bathroom <b>towel</b> <b>bars,</b> mouldings etc. Properly installed blocking is easier to find and use for attaching wall hardware than studs alone. Once drywall, or any other material, covers the wall {{it can be difficult to}} find 2x4 studs for attachment, and the position of nails and screws must be adjusted to stud location. Thus, if blocking is installed at a uniform and predetermined height, attachment sites can be found without using a stud finder, and the blocking can be utilized anywhere along a wall at that height. This is particularly useful for installing upper cabinets in kitchens or bathrooms as they tend to be fairly heavy and finding appropriate studs for installation can be difficult.|$|R

25|$|The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), {{which oversees}} the {{regulation}} of antimicrobial agents and materials in that country, found that copper alloys kill more than 99.9% of disease-causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly. Copper and copper alloys are unique classes of solid materials as no other solid touch surfaces have permission in the U.S. to make human health claims (EPA public health registrations were previously restricted only to liquid and gaseous products). The EPA has granted antimicrobial registration status to 355 different copper alloy compositions. In healthcare applications, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include bedrails, handrails, over-bed tables, sinks, faucets, door knobs, toilet hardware, intravenous poles, computer keyboards, etc. In public facility applications, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include health club equipment, elevator equipment, shopping cart handles, etc. In residential building applications, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include kitchen surfaces, bedrails, footboards, door push plates, <b>towel</b> <b>bars,</b> toilet hardware, wall tiles, etc. In mass transit facilities, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include handrails, stair rails grab bars, chairs, benches, etc. A comprehensive list of copper alloy surface products that have been granted antimicrobial registration status with public health claims by the EPA can be found here: Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces#Approved products.|$|R
5000|$|MRSA {{refers to}} a {{resistant}} variation of a common bacterium which has evolved to survive beta-lactam antibiotics, including Penicillin and Methicillin. First discovered in the UK in 1961, it is now worldwide. It is popularly {{referred to as a}} [...] "superbug", more appropriately as multiple resistant Staphylococcus aureus. It most commonly colonizes the anterior third of the nasal cavity and otherwise healthy people may carry MRSA without symptoms, from weeks to years. There are three postulates relating to the development of multiple resistant 'staph'. One is the widespread, inappropriate use of antibiotics particularly for virus infections where they can do no good. Another is the inclusion of antibiotics in animal feed. A third is simply genetic selection of the [...] "fittest bacteria".The commonest presentations include pustules, furuncles, carbuncles and abscesses, although misdiagnosisas a [...] "spider bite" [...] is not uncommon.The Centers for Disease Control have defined the five [...] "C's" [...] that make up the major risk factors asCrowding, frequent skin Contact, Compromised skin, sharing Contaminated personal care items, and lack of Cleanliness. Consequently, it is incumbent on those who look after athletes to stress adequate hygiene, cover open lesions completely with clean, dry dressings, advise against sharing of <b>towels,</b> <b>bar</b> soap, and personal care items, disinfect surfaces that contact bare skin and maintain equipment hygienically.|$|R

One source states that in 1784 Robert Gaymer moved with his family from Starston to Banham (both are places in Norfolk), where he farmed “and produced the first identifiable Gaymer cider”. His son John, “Long” John as he was known, due to his height of 6 ft. 10½in., continued the cider-making, and indeed an advertisement from “The Bury and Norwich Post” of 26 May 1800 states that he had inherited the trade secrets of his father-in-law Joseph Chapman which were “the result of {{the last ten years}} practice and experience” and that “The cydermaking business is carried on by the said John Gaymer at Banham aforesaid, by whom all orders will be thankfully received, and readily executed”. Joseph Chapman was describing himself as a “cyder merchant” in 1781. [...] “Long” John was buried in Banham churchyard in 1843.|$|R

50|$|The film is {{presented}} through several flashbacks {{as the three}} inmates are being interviewed {{in regards to the}} apparent suicide of their 4th cellmate, Mitch Palmer, who has hanged himself. It is gradually revealed throughout the interviews that the inmates tortured and humiliated Mitch prior to his hanging. The film begins with the four cellmates playing poker for cigarettes and trading stories of their lives prior to their incarcerations. After Mitch wins all of his cellmates’ cigarettes, they coerce him to play one more game. Mitch says he’ll put his entire bag of cigarettes on the table, and the loser has to eat an entire tube of toothpaste. Mitch loses the round and refuses to eat the toothpaste as the cellmates continually ask him to uphold his end of the bet. At first it seems like the cellmates decide to give up and call it a night. Harry Katish, who is in jail for armed robbery, pretends to wash up and wraps a <b>towel</b> around a <b>bar</b> of soap. He then goes to Mitch and begins to scream and hit him with the soap, as the others grab him and hold him down. All three force him to eat the entire tube of toothpaste. The three leave him be as Mitch lies on the floor, his stomach in pain. Peter Thompson, a low level drug dealer, goes to Mitch and pretends to be concerned, and says he’ll make him a special drink that will make him feel better. Peter grabs a glass, and fills it with water, salt, and a piece of pepper. Mitch says he isn’t stupid, but the other cellmates tell him as far as they’re all concerned, he already drank the drink, and threaten to hold him down again. Out of fear of being held down again, Mitch drinks as much as he can but begins to throw up. The cellmates laugh, and Peter says he’ll make another drink to make him feel better. Peter takes water filled with urine and feces from the toilet bowl. Mitch however, is choking and throwing up, but the cellmates start a countdown advising they’ll force him to drink it. Mitch grabs the glass and after one sip begins to throw up and choke. Jack Ulrich, in jail for arson, becomes enraged and violently beats Mitch, telling him to lick up his vomit with his tongue and belittles him as a pig. Mitch begs and pleads that he’ll clean up the mess with his mop, but Jack continues to beat him harder as Peter and Harry watch apathetically. Mitch crawls to the mess and begins to lick the vomit, further becoming sick. The cellmates become bored and decide to call it a night.|$|R
