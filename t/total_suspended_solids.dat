Six selected stations at different localities and water quality level was selected under this study. Eight physical and biological parameters of the sample were measured are pH, temperature, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), <b>Total</b> <b>Suspended</b> <b>Solid</b> (TSS), turbidity, salinity and total coliform. The mean value of the measured parameters was compared with Interim National Quality Water Standard (INQWS) and Water Quality Index Department of Environment (DOE) for analysis and categorization. The classes that are indicated by each parameter showed as follow: pH (IIA), temperature (I, IIB, IV AND V), Dissolved Oxygen (IIA and IIB), Biological Oxygen Demand (IIA and IIB), <b>Total</b> <b>Suspended</b> <b>Solid</b> (V), Turbidity (IIA AND IIB), Salinity (IIB, III, IV, V) and total coliform (V).

Out of 223 data sets, 12 percent complied with the biochemical oxygen demand standards, 26 percent with the phosphorus standards, and 40 percent with the <b>total</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> standards.

25|$|Ash ponds, a type {{of surface}} impoundment, are a widely used {{treatment}} technology at coal-fired plants. These ponds use gravity to settle out large particulates (measured as <b>total</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>solids)</b> from power plant wastewater. This technology does not treat dissolved pollutants. Power stations use additional technologies to control pollutants, depending on the particular wastestream in the plant. These include dry ash handling, closed-loop ash recycling, chemical precipitation, biological treatment (such as an activated sludge process), membrane systems, and evaporation-crystallization systems. Technological advancements in ion exchange membranes and electrodialysis systems has enabled high efficiency treatment of flue-gas desulfurization wastewater to meet recent EPA discharge limits. The treatment approach is similar for other highly scaling industrial wastewaters.|$|E
25|$|High solids (dry) digesters are {{designed}} to process materials with a solids content between 25 and 40%. Unlike wet digesters that process pumpable slurries, high solids (dry – stackable substrate) digesters {{are designed}} to process solid substrates without the addition of water. The primary styles of dry digesters are continuous vertical plug flow and batch tunnel horizontal digesters. Continuous vertical plug flow digesters are upright, cylindrical tanks where feedstock is continuously fed {{into the top of}} the digester, and flows downward by gravity during digestion. In batch tunnel digesters, the feedstock is deposited in tunnel-like chambers with a gas-tight door. Neither approach has mixing inside the digester. The amount of pretreatment, such as contaminant removal, depends both upon the nature of the waste streams being processed and the desired quality of the digestate. Size reduction (grinding) is beneficial in continuous vertical systems, as it accelerates digestion, while batch systems avoid grinding and instead require structure (e.g. yard waste) to reduce compaction of the stacked pile. Continuous vertical dry digesters have a smaller footprint due to the shorter effective retention time and vertical design. Wet digesters can be designed to operate in either a high-solids content, with a <b>total</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> (TSS) concentration greater than ~20%, or a low-solids concentration less than ~15%.|$|E
