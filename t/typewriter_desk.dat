50|$|She {{designed}} and patented a <b>typewriter</b> <b>desk.</b> (United States Patent 2545253). It was filed on April 1, 1948 and published on March 13, 1951.|$|E
50|$|A <b>{{typewriter}}</b> <b>desk</b> is {{an antique}} desk form meant {{to hold a}} typewriter in an efficient position for the typist. This position is usually a few inches lower than the 29 inch (73.7 cm) height of the typical antique desktop.|$|E
5000|$|After World War I {{typewriters}} {{gradually became}} less costly and the <b>typewriter</b> <b>desk</b> {{was more or}} less standardised in two forms: One was a small mobile desk incorporating four wheels with brakes, the other was an [...] "L" [...] shaped desk with a [...] "normal" [...] height section for reading and handwriting and a lower section for the typewriter.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generations of}} typewriters, {{in the last}} quarter of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th, spurred the {{invention}} and production of a variety of <b>typewriter</b> <b>desks.</b>|$|R
50|$|All of {{the early}} <b>typewriter</b> <b>desks</b> were {{extremely}} sturdy affairs since typewriters were not electric and could be operated only by constant pounding on the keys. The pounding could have gradually destroyed several traditional desks.|$|R
50|$|Today, <b>typewriter</b> <b>desks</b> still exist, {{and are in}} {{production}} but as computer desks. In order to achieve the highest typing results the height of table should be 75 cm, the width of desk (distance from eyes to computer screen 50-70 cm) not more than 80 cm.|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{typewriters}} {{were very}} costly machines which one {{tried to protect}} from dust or accidents. They were also very ungainly or even ugly to those unfamiliar with them, and getting them out of sight was useful for aesthetic reasons. Therefore, early <b>typewriter</b> <b>desks</b> often had some method for hiding the typewriter or getting {{it out of the}} way within the desk, sometimes by swivelling it or turning it.|$|R
60|$|Not as {{priest or}} soldier or judge does youth seek honor to-day, {{but as a}} man of offices. The {{business}} subaltern, charming and gallant as the jungle-gallopers of Kipling, drills files, not of troops, but of correspondence. The artist plays the keys, not of pianos, but of <b>typewriters.</b> <b>Desks,</b> not decks; courts of office-buildings, not of palaces--these are the stuff of our latter-day drama. Not through wolf-haunted forests nor purple cañons, but through tiled hallways and elevators move our heroes of to-day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I dun'no'; you're so darn honest, {{and you got}} so {{much more}} sense than this bunch of Bronx totties. Gee! they'll make bum stenogs. I know. I've worked in an office. They'll keep their gum and a looking-glass in the upper {{right-hand}} drawer of their <b>typewriter</b> <b>desks,</b> {{and the old man}} will call them down eleventy times a day, and they'll marry the shipping-clerk first time he sneaks out from behind a box. But you got sense, and somehow--gee! I never know how to express things--glad I'm taking this English composition stuff--oh, you just seem to understand a guy. I never liked that Yid Weintraub till you made me see how darn clever and nice he really is, even if he does wear spats." ...|$|R
2500|$|On January 28, 2010 {{an exhibit}} {{opened at the}} Harold B. Lee Library {{on the campus of}} Brigham Young University, {{displaying}} several items from Alexander's home office, which he referred to as [...] "the Box." [...] Items include manuscripts, editions of all his books, his violin, <b>typewriter,</b> and <b>desk.</b>|$|R
50|$|Glass cases hold various objects {{relating}} to the {{events leading up to}} Kosovo's independence, such as Rugova's glasses, <b>typewriter</b> and <b>desk,</b> and the mobile phone of his media adviser at that time, Xhemajl Mustafa. Also, there are pictures of 1950s Pristina displayed inside the museum and a bust of Ibrahim Rugova is displayed outside the museum.|$|R
2500|$|In the Batman Beyond episode [...] "Sentries of the Last Cosmos", the {{character}} Eldon Michaels claims a <b>typewriter</b> on his <b>desk</b> to {{have belonged to}} Philip K. Dick.|$|R
50|$|The gallery {{also has}} a display about English writer Arthur Ransome. His <b>desk,</b> <b>typewriter</b> and other memorabilia are exhibited. The gallery is also the {{official}} address of The Arthur Ransome Society.|$|R
25|$|The {{office of}} the Three Investigators is a house trailer, hidden among the piles of scrap in the salvage yard. It has many secret entrances. The {{headquarters}} has a small lab, a darkroom and an office with <b>desk,</b> <b>typewriter,</b> telephone, tape recorder, and reference books.|$|R
50|$|Anderson married Karen Kruse in 1953 {{and moved}} {{with her to}} the San Francisco Bay area. Their {{daughter}} Astrid (now married to science fiction author Greg Bear) was born in 1954. They made their home in Orinda, California. Over the years Poul gave many readings at The Other Change of Hobbit bookstore in Berkeley, and his wife later donated his <b>typewriter</b> and <b>desk</b> to the store. He died of cancer on July 31, 2001, after a month in the hospital. A few of his novels were first published posthumously.|$|R
50|$|When Harold White and Gordon Haist bought The Naperville Sun for $600 in 1936, the year-old {{publication}} {{was little}} more than a <b>typewriter,</b> a <b>desk</b> and a name. At the end of The Suns first year the paper was still being distributed for free to some 2,000 families, and printed in Downers Grove, Illinois, for a fee that exceeded the revenue coming in, while its size had dwindled to four pages. In that first decade, the number of publishing pratfalls was barely exceeded by the will to learn from a bumpy start — and keep the paper in print.|$|R
5000|$|Fountain Publishers {{was started}} in 1988 by James Tumusiime and his wife. Its first offices were {{on top of the}} former City Bar. Fountain {{employed}} only four individuals, with just a <b>typewriter</b> and four <b>desks.</b> Their maiden publication was, [...] "Who is Who in Uganda", a miniature directory of politicians, religious men and academicians. Uganda 30 years, 1992, their second imprint is telling too 30 year old nation birthday book.|$|R
50|$|The store {{opened in}} a retail arcade off Telegraph Avenue in May 1977, the same weekend that Star Wars opened in theatres. The store moved to Downtown Berkeley in 1993, at 2020 Shattuck near Addison. The Shattuck Avenue store, {{operated}} from April 1993 to April 2010, {{was in a}} three story building built around 1905. The second floor, known to the staff as Shelob's lair, was the store office. The main street level was the bookstore and Nee's toy collection. Downstairs in the basement storage were thousands more books. The store window displayed Poul Anderson's <b>typewriter</b> and <b>desk,</b> donated by his wife, Karen Anderson, after Poul's death in 2001. For several years, the window also held Whitmore's Hugo Award for co-chairing Worldcon in 2001.|$|R
5000|$|A small boom {{in office}} work and desk {{production}} {{occurred at the}} end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th with the introduction of smaller and less expensive electrical presses and efficient carbon paper coupled with the general acceptance of the <b>typewriter.</b> Steel <b>desks</b> were introduced to take heavier loads of paper and withstand the pounding meted out on the typewriters. This also gave rise to the Typewriter Desk; a platform, sometimes on wheels and with expandable surface via flaps, that was built to a specific height to make typing easier and more comfortable than when using a standard or traditional desk. The L-shaped desk also became popular, with the [...] "leg" [...] being used as an annex for the typewriter.|$|R
50|$|In {{the current}} comics and media spinoffs, the Daily Planet is {{presented}} as a thoroughly modern news operation, including operating an Internet web site much like most large newspapers. The Planets reporters also have access to the best modern equipment to aid their work, though Perry White has often been shown as still favoring his manual typewriter. In 2008, it was said that Clark (at least in this era/continuity) uses a <b>typewriter</b> at his <b>desk</b> due to his powers causing minor interference in regular desktop computers.|$|R
50|$|The Spirit of Charles Lindbergh is a {{short film}} made in 1984 by Orson Welles. The film was {{intended}} as a private video letter from Welles to his longtime friend and accountant Bill Cronshaw, who was ill. In the film, Welles sits behind a <b>typewriter</b> at his <b>desk</b> and speaks of the human spirit, quoting the journal of aviator Charles Lindbergh. Welles was in visibly poor health himself when the film was made, and he did not intend for it to be seen by the public.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of John Kinloch, {{managing}} editor of the California Eagle, sitting in front of his <b>typewriter</b> at a <b>desk</b> in the newspaper offices. Kinloch came to Los Angeles to live with his aunt, Charlotta Bass, and with hopes of becoming a screenwriter. Among his duties at the Eagle, Kinloch wrote a column, "Kinloch's Corner," and was the announcer of the newspaper's nightly radio program. Bass was groooming Kinloch to take over the newspaper, but her plans were shattered when Kinloch was killed in a battle during World War II...|$|R

An elderly man sits at a <b>typewriter</b> on a <b>desk</b> in the right {{foreground}} while two younger men (one of them is Mr. Batty himself) work at desks along the back wall behind him. Mr. Batty sits, while the other stands as he talks on the phone. Daylight shines through the blinds of the windows on the right wall while a large calendar hangs over the back wall which reads "Let Lyon Guard Your Goods"...|$|R
60|$|She {{tripped off}} toward the door leading to Manton's private offices, and Lane's gaze, curiously {{following}} her, found her costume to be startling even to his expectant eyes. Then she disappeared. Lane's gaze sought the corner and desk that {{once upon a time}} had been his. A blond young lady, also with bobbed hair, was operating a <b>typewriter</b> at his <b>desk.</b> She glanced up, and espying Lane, she suddenly stopped her work. She recognized him. But, if she were Hattie Wilson, it was certain that Lane did not recognize her. Then the office girl returned.|$|R
50|$|Hibbert {{attributed}} {{her large}} output to her regular working habits. She described {{herself as a}} compulsive writer and would write all seven days in the week. She started every morning at the <b>typewriter</b> on her <b>desk,</b> usually completing five thousand words by lunchtime. Though writing stimulated her, she found the typewriter to be a physical strain. She devoted five hours every day to her writing, {{in addition to the}} time that it took her to proof-read her draft and conduct research. In the afternoon, she would personally answer all the fan mail she received. She would also spend time at Kensington Central Library. In the evening, she played chess if she could find an opponent or attended social engagements.|$|R
5000|$|In November 1944, Nye was {{defeated}} in his re-election attempt by Governor John Moses, a Democrat. Nye chose {{to remain in the}} Washington area. He and his wife had purchased 3 acre of pasture land in Chevy Chase, part of a farm on a hill above Rock Creek Park. Their two sons had been born in 1943 and 1944. [...] Nye organized and became president of Records Engineering, Inc., in Washington, D.C. The pre-computer age firm created, organized, and managed records of industrial and government clients. In 1960 he was appointed to the Federal Housing Administration as Assistant to the Commissioner and in charge of housing for the elderly. In 1963, he accepted an appointment to the professional staff of the U.S. Senate Committee on Aging. 1966 saw his grand retirement party at the U.S. Capitol. It was attended by the Senators Robert Kennedy and Ted Kennedy and hosted by Senator Everett Dirksen, who presented Nye with a <b>typewriter</b> and <b>desk</b> lamp and orders to begin his memoirs. Nye became a consultant to churches and private groups desiring government funds for the building of retirement housing.|$|R
5000|$|For 58 years, Wilson was the {{business}} partner of Arthur Lessac, {{who has become}} an internationally known professor of voice. Upset at being turned down by the Yale Glee Club, Wilson first sought out Lessac as a voice coach in the 1940s. [...] Later, Wilson gave Lessac a <b>desk,</b> <b>typewriter</b> and secretary to write The Use and Training of the Human Voice, now in its third edition. He also helped Lessac popularize this voice and body system. Lessac Technologies, Inc. (LTI) was created in 2000, and is now developing computer software for text-to-speech technology. As chairman of the venture, Wilson worked with the CIO, his longtime associate, Gary A. Marple, to obtain several patents {{in the two years}} before his death at the age of 82.|$|R

5000|$|While Lorena {{was working}} at Southern Bell, she saw a notice that a higher paying switchman’s job was open. She applied for the post, which {{involved}} making sure routing equipment was working. She was denied {{on the basis that}} the job was only given to men.She {{sent a letter to the}} Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which investigated but Southern Bell said their decision was made, citing a Georgia rule women could not be made to lift anything heavier than 30 pounds. In her current position as a clerk, she had to lift a 34-pound typewriter each day. She filed a legal appeal which she lost in district court. She was represented by a union lawyer in court. After returning to work, she began to write out her reports by hand instead of lifting her <b>typewriter</b> onto the <b>desk.</b> Her supervisor complained and suspended her from work.She then met with Marguerite Rawalt who told her that the National Organization for Women would represent her for free. Sylvia Roberts was assigned to her appeal which was heard before Judge Griffin Bell of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. She eventually won her case after years of appeals. The primary argument used was that “women come in all shapes and sizes.” The idea that no woman could lift thirty pounds was ridiculous given the number of women who routinely carried thirty pound children. [...] In the end, Lorena Weeks received a check for $31,000 in back pay and the switchman’s job.|$|R
