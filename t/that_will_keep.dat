500|$|The {{second volume}} of the manga was {{positively}} reviewed at Anime News Network by Theron Martin, who wrote: [...] "With its second volume the title pushes fully {{into the realm of}} romantic comedy, liberally sprinkling its story with humorous asides, pratfalls, and anecdotes while still dealing head-on with the much more serious and involved love triangle springing up around Hazumu. For all its attempts to be funny, though, it is the story's more dramatic side <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> you coming back." [...] In ANN's review of manga volume three, Theron Martin wrote, [...] "The artistry of Yukimaru Katsura rarely devotes more effort to backgrounds than necessary, but its strength has always lain in the character designs and costuming. The array of the female cast provides a great contrast of looks ... the male characters, though easily distinguishable, stand out less." [...] In ANN's double review of manga volumes four and five, Martin commented, [...] "these volumes offer a solid conclusion to this lovely little yuri series. It does handle things rather differently than in the anime version, and those irritated by the anime's ending should find this one more to their liking." ...|$|E

[...] Peter Travers, writing for Rolling Stone, called the film [...] "a smart, passionate, steadily engrossing thriller". Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised Pakula's direction, writing, [...] "Pakula has directed an intense, enveloping, gratifyingly thorough screen adaptation of Mr. Turow's story." [...] Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that film was [...] "a top-notch courtroom drama <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> you guessing if you haven't read the book; even if you have, it is still a very well crafted story." [...] Variety magazine praised the performances, writing, [...] "Ford, in a very mature, subtle, lowkey performance, pulls off the difficult feat of making it impossible to be sure. Bedelia is wondrously controlled, and Scacchi, sans any hint of a European accent, is convincing and seductive." [...] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune praised the supporting cast, writing, [...] "Raul Julia is excellent as Ford's sinister defense attorney. John Spencer, Joe Grifasi, Tom Mardirosian and Sab Shimono are each compelling as investigator, political lackey, prosecutor and coroner." ...|$|E
