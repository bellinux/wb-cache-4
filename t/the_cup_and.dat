5|$|The cup {{came to the}} British Museum with a {{custom-made}} hexagonal case {{of leather}} on a wood frame, with iron lock, handles and mounts. This was either made {{at the same time}} or soon after <b>the</b> <b>cup,</b> <b>and</b> has incised and stamped foliate decoration and a blackletter inscription: YHE.SUS.O.MARYA.O.MARYA YHE SUS.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{surfaces}} {{are decorated with}} scenes in basse-taille enamel with translucent colours that reflect light from the gold beneath; many areas of gold both underneath the enamel and in the background have engraved and pointillé decoration worked in the gold. In particular the decoration features large areas of translucent red, which have survived in excellent condition. This colour, known as rouge clair, {{was the most difficult}} to achieve technically, and highly prized for this and the brilliance of the colour when it was done successfully. Scenes from the life of Saint Agnes run round the top of the cover and the sloping underside of the main body. The symbols of the Four Evangelists run round the foot of <b>the</b> <b>cup,</b> <b>and</b> there are enamel medallions at the centre of the inside of both <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> <b>and</b> the cover. The lower of the two added bands contains enamel Tudor roses on a diapered pointillé background; this was apparently added under HenryVIII. The upper band has an engraved inscription filled in with black enamel, with a barrier of laurel branches in green to mark off the end of the inscription from its beginning.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of UEFA club {{competition}} winning football managers.

50|$|<b>The</b> Steel <b>Cups</b> <b>and</b> Balls is Paul Gertner's {{approach}} to <b>the</b> classic <b>cups</b> <b>and</b> balls routine. Three steel ball bearings vanish and appear {{in and around}} three steel <b>cups.</b> <b>The</b> routine ends with several massive, heavy ball bearings being produced from <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> <b>and</b> dropping to <b>the</b> table with a large thud. Amazingly, one of the bearings is too big to fit in <b>the</b> <b>cup,</b> despite having just been produced from it.|$|R
5000|$|A typical <b>cups</b> <b>and</b> balls routine {{includes}} {{many of the}} most fundamental effects of magic: the balls can vanish, appear, transpose, reappear and transform. Basic skills, such as misdirection, manual dexterity, sleight of hand, and audience management are also essential to most <b>cups</b> <b>and</b> balls routines. As a result, mastery of <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> <b>and</b> balls is considered by many as the litmus test of a good magician. Indeed the late magic authority John Mulholland wrote that no less a person than Harry Houdini had expressed the opinion that no one could be considered an accomplished magician until he had mastered <b>the</b> <b>Cups</b> <b>and</b> Balls. Professor Hoffman called <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> <b>and</b> balls [...] "the groundwork of all legerdemain".|$|R
5|$|The {{regulations}} {{set down}} by Lord Stanley call for two Trustees, {{who had the}} sole, joint right to govern <b>the</b> <b>Cup</b> <b>and</b> the conditions of its awarding until 1947, when they ceded control to the NHL. While the original regulations allow for a Trustee to resign, to date, all Cup Trustees have served until their deaths. In {{the event of a}} vacancy, the remaining trustee names the replacement for the deceased or resigned Trustee.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus olla bears a {{resemblance}} to a miniature bird's nest containing eggs, hence the common name bird's nest fungi. The fruiting body, or peridium, is roughly funnel-shaped, 10–18mm tall and 8–12mm wide. It is greyish yellow or greyish brown to fawn-colored {{and covered with}} even, fine-textured hairs on the outside surface. The inner surface is silver grey and smooth, often with faint transverse ridges. Cyathus olla is thick-walled, and flared outwards at the rim; the rim is typically wavy in outline. The 'eggs', or peridioles, typically number 8 to 10 in <b>the</b> <b>cup,</b> <b>and</b> they are white or grey in color, with a diameter of 2–4mm—conspicuously larger than other Cyathus species. They are covered with a thin membrane called a tunica.|$|E
5|$|However, their cup success helped Vaduz {{to another}} UEFA Cup, which {{resulted}} in their first win in the competition with a 4–2 aggregate victory against FAI Cup-holders Longford Town in July 2004. Burgmeier netted his second European goal during the ties, during the 3–2 second-leg victory, before they were defeated in the second qualifying round to Belgian-side Beveren, during which Burgmeier was injured forcing him to undergo a knee operation and miss {{the first month of}} the league season. Vaduz repeated their efforts domestically, defeating USV Eschen/Mauren in <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> <b>and</b> reaching the promotion play-off game. However, they were defeated by Schaffhausen and were left with only ten players on secure contracts for the following season. Burgmeier himself left Vaduz after five years with the club, during which he played 115league games and scored 27goals.|$|E

5|$|The fruit bodies, or apothecia, of Banksiamyces {{species are}} {{cup-shaped}} receptacles borne on a stipe (stalk), colored dark brown to black {{with a dark}} grey center. When dry, the apothecia are covered with a whitish powder. The edges of the cup may be rolled inwards (especially when dry), or be twisted and somewhat flattened. Both the outermost tissue layer (the ectal excipulum) and the tissue of the stalk are made of fungal cells with brown pigments that can be variously thick- or thin-walled, covered with small particles (granules), and spherical to ellipsoid. The middle tissue layer (the medullary excipulum) of both <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> <b>and</b> the internal tissue layer (the medulla) of the stalk contain a layer of tissue made of hyphae similar to the ectal excipulum. A second layer of tissue is made of hyphae that are translucent and gelatinous; this layer may be present in either the medullary excipulum, the medulla, or both.|$|E
5|$|The trio are {{captured}} by Snatchers {{and taken to}} Malfoy Manor, where Bellatrix Lestrange tortures Hermione to learn how the three acquired the sword, which she had believed was in her vault at Gringotts. With the help of Dobby the house-elf they escape along with fellow prisoners Luna Lovegood, Ollivander, Dean Thomas, and the goblin Griphook. Peter Pettigrew emerges and begins to strangle Harry, but Harry reminds him that he owes him a life debt. When Pettigrew hesitates, his brief moment of mercy causes his silver hand to turn on him, strangling and killing him, despite Harry and Ron's best efforts to restrain it. During the escape Harry steals Draco Malfoy's wand and Dobby dies. Bellatrix' terror in interrogating Hermione suggests to Harry some exceptional object is in her vault, and when questioned, Griphook confirms a gold cup is indeed in her vault. With Griphook's help, they break into the vault at Gringotts, retrieve <b>the</b> <b>cup,</b> <b>and</b> escape on a dragon, but in the chaos they lose the Sword of Gryffindor. Harry has a vision of Voldemort and sees he now understands their plan, and intends to make his remaining horcruxes even safer. The vision also confirms the unidentified horcrux is at Hogwarts.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of a leopard with glowing blue eyes (later {{revealed}} to be Kesha) walking down an alleyway. The song's title flashes {{on the screen and}} the video pans to Kesha. She walks down the alleyway with two men who grab another man. Kesha spray-paints a dollar sign on his chest. They come to a party where she and her friends flash their tattooed dollar signs on their wrists and forearms in order to enter. As they enter, everyone starts dancing and the party-goers' faces are shown changing into different animals'. In the following scene, Kesha is seen sitting on a chair with two men by her side. Jeffree Star then approaches Kesha. Kesha and Star engage in a choreographed dance battle; Star then shoots Kesha with a laser chain saw which she deflects with her bracelet, Kesha responds by shooting lasers out of her hands, killing Star. After the battle the party-goers crawl around Kesha and she is seen holding a gold cup with a blue foaming liquid spilling {{over the top of the}} glass. As Kesha gives the party goers a drink, their faces turn into different kinds of animals. The video ends with everyone dancing and turning into half animal humans, Kesha however, drinks from <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> <b>and</b> turns back into a leopard.|$|E

5000|$|The magic duo Penn & Teller {{performs}} a unique version of <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> <b>and</b> balls trick in their act. [...] Initially, they perform the trick with small aluminum foil balls <b>and</b> plastic <b>cups.</b> <b>The</b> trick {{ends with the}} appearance of larger foil balls under <b>the</b> <b>cups,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> surprise appearance of an extra unrelated object, such as a potato or a lime, under one or more cups. They then repeat the trick using transparent plastic cups, claiming that they will reveal how to perform the trick. [...] However, as part of the joke, they do the trick so fast as to make it difficult to follow. They claim that this version of <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> <b>and</b> balls breaks all four rules of magic: not to tell the audience how a trick is done, not to repeat the same trick twice, not to show the audience the secret preparation, and the 'unwritten rule' never to perform <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> <b>and</b> balls with clear plastic cups. They claim this version of the trick got them kicked out of The Magic Castle.|$|R

When SNG and CNEV published their protocol for the 33rd America's Cup, there was criticism over its terms, with some teams and yacht clubs calling it the worst protocol {{in the history of the}} event.
