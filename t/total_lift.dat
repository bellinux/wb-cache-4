25|$|At the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) in China {{there are}} two stairsteps of five large ship locks (each 300 m long and 35 m wide) for ten-thousand-tonne ships. In {{addition}} to this {{there will be a}} boat lift (a large elevator) capable of moving a three-thousand-ton ship vertically in one motion. The locks and the boat lift provide a <b>total</b> <b>lift</b> of up to 113 metres.|$|E
25|$|NASA {{planned to}} use two {{separate}} boosters for the Constellation Program missions – the Ares I for crew and the Ares V for cargo. This would have allowed the two launch vehicles to be optimized for their respective missions, and allowed a much higher <b>total</b> <b>lift</b> for the Ares V without being cost-prohibitive. The Constellation Program thus combined the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous method adopted by the Apollo program's lunar missions with the Earth Orbit Rendezvous method which had also been considered.|$|E

500|$|The XB-70 used {{compression}} lift, which {{arose from}} a shock wave {{generated by the}} sharp {{leading edge of the}} central engine intake splitter plate below the wing. [...] At Mach 3 cruising speed, the shock wave attached along the wing leading edge, preventing the high pressure behind the shock front from leaking up over the wing. The compression lift provided five percent of the <b>total</b> <b>lift.</b> The wing included inboard camber to more effectively use the higher pressure field behind the strong shock wave. Unique among aircraft of its size, the outer portions of the wings were hinged, and could be pivoted downward by up to 65 degrees, acting almost as a type of variable-geometry wingtip device. This increased the aircraft's directional stability at supersonic speeds, shifted the center of lift to a more favorable position at high speeds, and strengthened the compression lift effect. With the wingtips drooped downwards, the compression lift shock wave would be further trapped under the wings.|$|E
2500|$|The lift for the STOVL {{version in}} the hover is {{obtained}} from a 2-stage lift fan (about 46%) {{in front of the}} engine, a vectoring exhaust nozzle (about 46%), and a nozzle in each wing using [...] fan air from the bypass duct(about 8%). These relative contributions to the <b>total</b> <b>lift</b> are based on thrust values of 18,680lb, 18,680lb and 3,290lb respectively. Another source gives thrust values of 20,000lb, 18,000lb and 3,900lb respectively.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{convenient}} to treat <b>total</b> <b>lift</b> as acting {{at a distance}} h ahead of the centre of gravity, so that the moment equation may be written:Applying the increment in angle of attack:Equating the two expressions for moment increment:The <b>total</b> <b>lift</b> [...] {{is the sum of}} [...] and [...] so the sum in the denominator can be simplified and written as the derivative of the <b>total</b> <b>lift</b> due to angle of attack, yielding:Where c is the mean aerodynamic chord of the main wing. The term:is known as the tail volume ratio. Its rather complicated coefficient, the ratio of the two lift derivatives, has values in the range of 0.50 to 0.65 for typical configurations, according to Piercy. Hence the expression for h may be written more compactly, though somewhat approximately, as:h is known as the static margin. For stability it must be negative. (However, for consistency of language, the static margin is sometimes taken as , so that positive stability is associated with positive static margin.) ...|$|E

50|$|The {{collective}} pitch control, or collective lever, is normally {{located on the}} left side of the pilot's seat with an adjustable friction control to prevent inadvertent movement. The collective changes the pitch angle of all the main rotor blades collectively (i.e., all at the same time) and independent of their position. Therefore, if a collective input is made, all the blades change equally, and as a result, the helicopter increases or decreases its <b>total</b> <b>lift</b> derived from the rotor. In level flight this would cause a climb or descent, while with the helicopter pitched forward an increase in <b>total</b> <b>lift</b> would produce an acceleration together with a given amount of ascent.|$|E
