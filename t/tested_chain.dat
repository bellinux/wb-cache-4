40|$|The paper {{presents}} a concept, known {{for many years}} and commonly applied in the automotive industry, to improve engine performance of the chain saw (higher maximum power rating and more advantageous torque parameters). The analyses were conducted on a Husqvarna 357 XP power saw, equipped with a modified resonance exhaust system with variable dimensions. The system was designed at the Department of Forest Technology (Poznań University of Life Sciences) to the already existing power unit, with specific timing gear, size, shape and angle of cylinder ducts. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess mechanical vibrations, recorded at the handles of a Husqvarna 357 XP chain saw, at three operation regimes of its engine. Analyses were conducted on the same chain saw equipped with an original vibration damper and a modified resonance system in its three variants and it may be stated that the introduction of design changes in the exhaust system has a significant effect on an increase in the power and torque of the <b>tested</b> <b>chain</b> saw. On the basis of recorded results it may be stated that the acceleration of vibrations both on the rear and front handles of the chain saw significantly differs in case of the application of the modified exhaust system in comparison to the original vibration damper. The application of the resonance system in the chain saw exhaust system leads to increased mechanical vibrations produced by the machine. However, it needs to be observed that the volume of the admissible standard is exceeded both for the chainsaw with the original damper and that with the used exhaust system. Vibrations of the chain saw with a resonance damper on the front handle are higher than those of the chain saw with the original damper on average by 28 %, while on the rear handle it is by 27 %. We need to stress the significantly higher difference when applying in the chain saw modified damper variants 1 and 3 in comparison with the original design...|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{aspects of}} {{polymers}} in mixed solvents are considered using the Edwards Hamiltonian formalism. Thermodynamic and structural properties are investigated and some predictions are made when the mixed solvent approaches criticality. Both the single {{and the many}} chain problems are examined. When the pure mixed solvent is near criticality, addition of {{a small amount of}} polymers shifts the criticality towards either enhanced compatibility or induced phase separation depending upon the value of the parameter describing the interaction asymmetry of the solvents with respect to the polymer. The polymer-solvent effective interaction parameter increases strongly when the solvent mixture approaches criticality. Accordingly, the apparent excluded volume parameter decreases and may vanish or even become negative. Consequently, the polymer undergoes a phase transition from a swollen state to an unperturbed state or even take a collapsed configuration. The effective potential acting on a <b>test</b> <b>chain</b> in strong solutions is calculated and the concept of Edwards screening discussed. Structural properties of ternary mixtures of polymers in mixed solvents are investigated within the Edwards Hamiltonian model. It is shown that the effective potential on a <b>test</b> <b>chain</b> in strong solutions could be written as an infinite series expansion of terms describing interactions via one chain, two chains etc. This summation can be performed following a similar scheme as in the Ornstein-Zernike series expansion.

40|$|ABSTRACT 1 Scan based {{transition}} {{tests are}} added to improve the detection of speed failures using scan tests. Empirical data suggests that both data volume and application time, for transition test, will increase dramatically. Techniques to address the above problem, for a class of transition tests called “enhanced transition tests”, are proposed. The first technique, which combines the ATE repeat capability {{and the notion of}} transition <b>test</b> <b>chains,</b> reduces <b>test</b> data volume by 46. 5 %, when compared with transition tests computed by a commercial transition test ATPG tool. The test application time could increase or decrease. To address the test time issue Exchange Scan, a new DFT technique, is proposed. Exchange scan reduces both data volume and application time by 46. 5 %. These techniques rely on the use of hold scan cells and highlights the effectiveness of hold-scan design to address test time and test data volume issues. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Experimentation is {{typically}} {{the last step}} before launching a network application in the wild. However, {{it is often difficult}} to gather enough hardware resources for exper-imenting with a reasonably sized overlay application inside a controlled environment. Virtualization is thus a handy technique for creating such an experimentation testbed. We propose a tool called NEmu designed to create virtual dynamic networks for testing and evaluating prototypes of overlay applications with a complete control over the network topology and link bandwidths. NEmu builds host-based overlay networks by using emulators such as QEMU. We illustrate the use of NEmu in the context of a file distribution overlay application. We evaluate the impact of chained TCP connections on the application performances. We show that NEmu enables us to obtain performance results concerning data rates and delays for end hosts depending on the number of intermediate hosts and the networking parameters of the overlay.

Focusing on Flory distributed melts we obtain δμ_c(n) ≈ (1 - 2 n/) / ρ√(n) for n ≪ ^ 2, hence, δμ_c(n) ≈ - 1 /ρ√(n) if n is similar to the typical length of the bath. Similar results are obtained for monodisperse solutions. Our perturbation calculations are checked numerically by analyzing the annealed length distribution P(N) of linear equilibrium polymers generated by Monte Carlo simulation of the bond-fluctuation model.
