From the lyrical poets of ancient Greece to Mexican corridistas, music allowed storytellers to effectively compose, retain, and present news.

30|$|The {{study and}} its design have several strengths. Through a longitudinal, {{prospective}} design, this project performs repeated measurements of work factors, intervening variables, and outcomes. This provides more reliable data on exposures (independent variables) than {{what has been}} customary until now. Also, information on variation across time is accounted for. As <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> <b>part</b> builds on the well-established QPS_Nordic (Dallner et al. 2000) {{as well as on}} other standardized inventories, the included instruments are psychometrically tested for validity and reliability. Several moderating or mediating factors are measured, allowing the study of social and psychological mechanisms of effects. Registry data are objective data and the data structure allows for multilevel models where individual level data are aggregated to department and organizational levels. Finally, the acquired response rate at the baseline survey assessment is in accordance with the estimated average response rate established in this kind of survey research (Baruch and Holtom 2008).|$|E
