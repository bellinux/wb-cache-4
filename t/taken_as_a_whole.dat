5|$|The Chronicle is not unbiased: {{there are}} {{occasions}} when {{comparison with other}} medieval sources {{makes it clear that}} the scribes who wrote it omitted events or told one-sided versions of stories; there are also places where the different versions contradict each other. <b>Taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> however, the Chronicle {{is the single most important}} historical source for the period in England between the departure of the Romans and the decades following the Norman conquest. Much of the information given in the Chronicle is not recorded elsewhere. In addition, the manuscripts are important sources for the history of the English language; in particular, the later Peterborough text is one of the earliest examples of Middle English in existence.|$|E
5|$|The inscribed ring {{remains the}} subject of {{considerable}} academic interest, {{and a number of}} theories regarding its origin, the reason for its burial and its date have been proposed. The inscription, which sustained irreparable damage shortly after its discovery, can no longer be read with certainty, and has been subjected to various attempts at reconstruction and interpretation. Recently, however, it has become possible to reconstruct the damaged portion with the aid of rediscovered depictions of the ring in its original state. <b>Taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> the inscribed ring may offer insight into the nature of the pre-Christian pagan religion of the Goths.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{fluctuating}} critical {{assessment of}} the various works over the years, Elgar's major works <b>taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> have {{in the twenty-first century}} recovered strongly from their neglect in the 1950s. The Record Guide in 1955 could list only one currently available recording of the First Symphony, none of the Second, one of the Violin Concerto, two of the Cello Concerto, two of the Enigma Variations, one of Falstaff, and none of The Dream of Gerontius. Since then there have been multiple recordings of all the major works. More than thirty recordings have been made of the First Symphony since 1955, for example, {{and more than a dozen}} of The Dream of Gerontius. Similarly, in the concert hall, Elgar's works, after a period of neglect, are once again frequently programmed. The Elgar Society's website, in its diary of forthcoming performances, lists performances of Elgar's works by orchestras, soloists and conductors across Europe, North America and Australia.|$|E

25|$|Those Australian {{producers}} who {{did try to}} break into TV faced almost insurmountable challenges. Imported American and British programs benefited from high budgets, an international talent pool and huge economies of scale, thanks to their very large domestic markets (relative to Australia), established worldwide distribution networks; additionally, since most American production houses and networks were based in Los Angeles, they had access to resources and expertise built up over decades by the Hollywood movie studios. These disadvantages were further exacerbated {{by the fact that}} American producers and networks offered Australian channels significant discount rates on bundled programming. <b>Taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> these factors meant that local producers were faced with a relative production-cost ratio on the order of 10:1 or more in favour of the imported product.|$|E
25|$|<b>Taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> Turkish cuisine is not homogenous. Aside from common Turkish specialities {{which can}} be found {{throughout}} the country, there are also region-specific specialities. The Black Sea region's cuisine (northern Turkey) is based on corn and anchovies. The southeast—Urfa, Gaziantep and Adana—is famous for its kebabs, mezes and dough-based desserts such as baklava, kadayıf and künefe. Especially in the western parts of Turkey, where olive trees are grown abundantly, olive oil is the major type of oil used for cooking. The cuisines of the Aegean, Marmara and Mediterranean regions display basic characteristics of Mediterranean cuisine as they are rich in vegetables, herbs and fish. Central Anatolia is famous for its pastry specialities such as keşkek (kashkak), mantı (especially of Kayseri) and gözleme.|$|E
25|$|<b>Taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> if {{the disease}} {{is limited to the}} kidney, only 20–30% develop metastatic disease after nephrectomy. More {{specific}} subsets show a five-year survival rate of around 90–95% for tumors less than 4cm. For larger tumors confined to the kidney without venous invasion, survival is still relatively good at 80–85%. For tumors that extend through the renal capsule and out of the local fascial investments, the survivability reduces to near 60%. Factors as general health and fitness or the severity of their symptoms impact the survival rates. For instance, younger people (among 20–40 years old) have a better outcome despite having more symptoms at presentation, possibly due to lower rates spread of cancer to the lymph nodes (stage III).|$|E
50|$|Goldstein {{developed}} an approach where a situation or phenomenon is analyzed holistically, {{rather than simply}} looking at an isolated event. First, when observing a situation, interpretations should be <b>taken</b> in <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> without giving special preference towards {{one part of the}} phenomenon. When describing the phenomenon, attention should not be diverted to one aspect of the phenomenon that may be of interest. The holistic approach calls instead for the phenomenon to be described from all angles without bias towards one part. Lastly, Goldstein argues that one must consider each and every phenomenon in reference to the entire situation.|$|R

25|$|The {{decay of}} {{a mixture of}} two or more {{materials}} which each decay exponentially, but with different half-lives, is not exponential. Mathematically, the sum of two exponential functions is not a single exponential function. A common example of such a situation is the waste of nuclear power stations, which is a mix of substances with vastly different half-lives. Consider a mixture of a rapidly decaying element A, with a half-life of 1 second, and a slowly decaying element B, with a half-life of 1 year. In a couple of minutes, almost all atoms of element A will have decayed after repeated halving of the initial number of atoms, but very few of the atoms of element B will have done so as {{only a tiny fraction of}} its half-life has elapsed. Thus, the mixture <b>taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> will not decay by halves.|$|E
25|$|Confronted {{with the}} {{challenge}} of showing 3-dimensional gameplay on 2-dimensional advertisements, the company partnered with Blockbuster and NBC in a coordinated effort. A $5 million campaign promoted NBC's fall lineup alongside the Virtual Boy. American viewers were encouraged via television advertisements on NBC to rent the console for US$10 at a local Blockbuster. This made it affordable for a large number of gamers to try the system, and produced 750,000 rentals. Upon returning the unit, renters received a coupon for $10 off the purchase of a Virtual Boy from any store. 3,000 Blockbuster locations were included in the promotion, which consisted of a sweepstakes with prizes including trips to see the taping of NBC shows. The popular rental system proved harmful to the Virtual Boy's long-term success, allowing gamers to see just how un-immersive the console was. By mid-1996, Blockbuster was selling its Virtual Boy units at $50 each. <b>Taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> the marketing campaign was commonly thought of as a failure.|$|E

Connectivity of the resting brain can be empirically parsed into distinct networks which closely resemble patterns of evoked task-based brain activity, {{and have a}} biological and genetic basis. Recently, these intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) have become a popular method for investigating brain functioning and brain-behavior relationships with external variables such as personality or psychiatric symptoms. However, replication {{studies are needed to}} test the correspondence, neurometrics, and associations observed for these networks across independent samples. Using a meta-level independent component analysis (ICA), we produced ICNs from three datasets collected from two samples of healthy adults, and demonstrate robust and independent replication of twelve ICNs. In each dataset, the ICNs were found to reflect sixteen task-based networks. Networks involved in executive functions, speech and audition, default mode processing, vision, and interoception showed the greatest spatial reliability and reproducibility; whereas, only the networks associated with the right-lateralized executive functions and speech-audition demonstrated at least fair within-subject reliability over time. We also demonstrated regions with the highest connectivity were disjointed from regions with the highest reliability. Additionally, we tested the ability for connectivity to reliably predict cognitive performance, which showed a trend-level finding implicating the default-mode network in attention and concentration. <b>Take</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> our findings agree with current hypotheses which postulate that intrinsic connectivity sustains, at rest, representations and modes of functioning from which task-evoked patterns of activation and connectivity are produced...|$|R
