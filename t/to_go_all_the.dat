He was also accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The only engineer he knew (who had attended MIT) dissuaded him from attending, telling Armstrong {{that it was not}} necessary <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to Cambridge, Massachusetts, for a good education.|$|E
5|$|In the 1999–2000 season, Arsenal {{participated in}} the Premier League. Despite the loss of striker Nicolas Anelka to Real Madrid, the club {{significantly}} strengthened in the summer, signing defenders Oleg Luzhny and Sylvinho as well as forwards Davor Šuker and Thierry Henry. Inconsistent performances in the league against lowly opposition meant Arsenal never posed a serious title challenge, ending the campaign as runners-up, 18 points behind Manchester United. The club had another poor season in the Champions League, finishing third in their group; this won them a consolation place in the UEFA Cup and Arsenal managed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to the final, where they faced Galatasaray in Copenhagen. The match ended in a 0–0 draw with few chances for either side to score; it went to penalties and Arsenal lost after Šuker and Patrick Vieira missed their spot-kicks.|$|E
5|$|Reyes {{received}} his first yellow {{card in the}} 76th minute, when he was late in tackling Silvestre after the French defender had played a backpass to Carroll. The break in play allowed Manchester United to make their first substitution, bringing on Fortune for O'Shea, {{who appeared to be}} struggling with a calf injury. With six minutes left in normal time, United won a corner on the left hand side, which Ronaldo played short to Scholes. Scholes returned the ball to Ronaldo, who crossed it into the penalty area, where Keane was unmarked at the back post. The ball eventually broke to the United captain, who shot, only to see four Arsenal players between him and the goal, ready to block his effort behind for another corner. Lehmann came to meet the second corner kick, but missed the ball, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way through to Van Nistelrooy; the Dutchman headed the ball goalwards, but Ljungberg was on the line and headed it up onto the crossbar and away.|$|E

500|$|In {{his only}} {{season on the}} {{football}} team (1950), he was Army's statistical leader in rushing, averaging 7.3 yards per carry, and in scoring, with 83 total points. Prior to Army's game with Penn, a scout for the latter team said Pollard was the best fullback in college football. In December, the Helms Athletic Foundation named him to their 1950 All-American team, along with fellow Army cadet Dan Foldberg. He was also named to the Associated Press and United Press All-East teams. The Associated Press praised his running capabilities, commenting that [...] "any time he lugs the ball he's liable <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Golden Ticket" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews, {{with several}} reviewers {{commenting on the}} selfishness and mean behavior of Michael in the episode. In a New York magazine article entitled [...] "Michael Finally Goes Too Far", Will Leitch describes it as [...] "one of the funnier recent episodes", but found Michael's willingness to sell out Dwight unsettling: [...] "Usually, when he’s about to do something over-the-top (like plant drugs on Toby), he backs off at the last second. This time, he's willing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way and sell out Dwight, his most loyal friend. It's a little jarring." [...] Leitch, however, said {{the sweetness of the}} subplot involving Kevin and Lynne offset some of the darker aspects of the episode, and praised several of the jokes including Michael's [...] "Shoe-La-La" [...] shoe store idea, Dwight's idea for a [...] "Horse Boat" [...] invention and the KGB knock knock jokes.|$|E
500|$|Poniewozik complimented the way [...] "Monteith really sold Finn’s {{feeling of}} being {{helpless}} and overmatched", and Canning said that Finn's reaction to Rachel's admission {{that she wanted to}} have sex because of the play was a [...] "solid and true moment". Rachel's reasoning, however, came in for harsh criticism: Brett Berk of Vanity Fair said it was [...] "neither believable nor even amusing" [...] that she would try intercourse for such a reason, Bell called her a [...] "dunce", and VanDerWerff didn't believe that she would just blurt it out to Finn. The Star-Ledger Vicki Hyman felt her decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way did not [...] "ring quite true", and Poniewozik called it [...] "essentially pity sex". Ausiello had a different view—"I would hardly call it pity sex"—and West said she was [...] "going to choose to believe" [...] that Rachel did not have her first time [...] "just to make him feel better".|$|E

500|$|Early in the season, as the Ohio Works team {{prepared}} for a second game with the Zanesville Moguls (close rivals in the 1905 championship games), the club manager, Hogan, spoke confidently on their chances of capturing the league pennant. [...] "If the boys go through the season as they are playing now, we will have no trouble winning out", he said to a reporter with The Youngstown Daily Vindicator. [...] "Our pitchers are in good condition and are holding the opposing batsmen to few hits. It is the pitching staff that has saved many a game for us. We have no [...]350 batters on the club, but any man on it is liable {{to step in and}} break up a game". A local newspaper confirmed Hogan's assessment of the team, observing that only one player, outfielder Will Thomas, had worked up a batting average of [...]306. Nevertheless, as Hogan predicted, the team defeated the Moguls, with a final score of 11–8. The game's highlights included the pitching of [...] "Long John" [...] Kennedy, who kept the Moguls to seven hits, and the batting of Edward Hilley, who [...] "unloosened a drive to middle field that permitted him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way around".|$|E
500|$|The art {{style of}} the game world drew acclaim from many reviewers, who welcomed the {{departure}} from Oblivions Cyrodiil. Jason Schreier of Wired described the land of Skyrim as a [...] "Viking-inspired treasure trove of flavor and charm", noting its contrast to Cyrodiil, which he considered generic by comparison. The Staff at Edge magazine described Cyrodiil as a [...] "patchwork of varying terrains", praising the more consistent design of Skyrim. Shibley praised [...] "the lack of copy-and-paste level design that's plagued Bethesda's previous games,... giving a lived-in and handcrafted look to the world". Bedford noted that the improved graphical fidelity over Oblivion allowed the game world to feel more lifelike, praising the [...] "misty mountain setting, complete with swirling fog and high-altitude snowstorms". An editor for PC PowerPlay praised {{the diversity of the}} dungeon design. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer cited criticisms that Oblivion faced for repetitive dungeons, noting that [...] "the composition of each dungeon is largely unique and individualized" [...] in Skyrim. He also favored the design choice to have a quick route out of a dungeon leading from its last room, eliminating a problem he identified Oblivion as having, where the player would clear a dungeon and then have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way back to the beginning to exit it. Many reviewers praised the large amount of things to do in the world outside of the main story. Tom Francis of PC Gamer noted that it was difficult to explore the world without becoming distracted by things to do, stating that, [...] "it's hard to walk for a minute in any direction without encountering an intriguing cave, a lonely shack, some strange stones, a wandering traveller, [...] a haunted fort".|$|E
2500|$|Following Vinokourov's exit, Patrice Clerc {{president}} of Tour organisers Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) stated: [...] "I am not downcast and I am {{all the more}} determined <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way in this fight...It may seem paradoxical but we are closing in on victory.

2500|$|The {{mainstream}} of Roman philosophy, {{such as the}} Stoics, advocated contemplation and acceptance of the inevitability of death of all mortals. [...] "It is necessary for some to stay and for others <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> while rejoicing {{with those who are}} with us, yet not grieving for those departing." [...] To grieve bitterly is to fail to perceive and accept the nature of things. Famously, Epictetus encouraged contemplation of one's loved ones as a [...] "jar" [...] or [...] "crystal cup" [...] which might break and be remembered without troubling the spirit, since [...] "you love a mortal, something not your own. It has been given to you for the present, not inseparably nor forever, but like a fig... at a fixed season of the year. If you yearn for it in the winter, you are a fool." ...|$|E
2500|$|Historians {{are divided}} {{as to the}} {{location}} of this battle. At the time, the name [...] "Ourique" [...] designated a large area south of Beja. Since 12th century chroniclers were unfamiliar with the region where the battle took place, they might have decided to call the location [...] "field of Ourique" [...] for lack of a more precise term. Nonetheless, the great distance that separated Ourique from the Christian lines farther north has led some historians to suggest various localities in central Portugal, abandoning the traditional idea that the combat occurred in Ourique in the Alentejo. It would have been difficult for the then Count of Portugal, with a realm little beyond the Mondego River, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way south to battle five Moorish Kings. One plausible alternative is Vila Chã de Ourique, located some ten miles from Santarém.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the {{remaining}} Allied forces north, south, {{and east of}} the Ruhr had been adjusting their lines {{in preparation for the}} final advance through Germany. Under the new concept, Bradley's 12th U.S. Army Group would make the main effort, with Hodges′ 1st Army in the center heading east for about [...] toward the city of Leipzig and the Elbe River. To the north, the 9th Army's XIX and XIII Corps would also drive for the Elbe, toward Magdeburg, about [...] north of Leipzig, although the army commander, General Simpson, hoped he would be allowed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to Berlin. To the south, Patton's 3rd Army was to drive east to Chemnitz, about [...] southeast of Leipzig, but well short of the Elbe, and then turn southeast into Austria. At the same time, General Devers' 6th U.S. Army Group would move south through Bavaria and the Black Forest to Austria and the Alps, ending the threat of any Nazi last-ditch stand there.|$|E

2500|$|Chill Out is {{a single}} {{continuous}} musical piece having many distinctive sections, each of which either segues into or introduces the next. The album {{as a whole is}} a progression, with percussion gradually introduced during the second half. The KLF have stated in interviews that the album was recorded in a 44-minute [...] "live" [...] take in their studio, Trancentral, located in the basement of The KLF member Jimmy Cauty's squat in Stockwell, South London. These took place at both Trancentral and the monthly 'Land of Oz' at London's Heaven nightclub. Said Cauty, [...] "There's no edits on it. Quite a few times we'd get near the end and make a mistake and so we'd have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way back to the beginning and set it all up again". According to Cauty's co-founder of The KLF, Bill Drummond, the album took two days to put together. [...] Record Collector compared The KLF's production method to that of established electronic musicians: [...] "While electronic dinosaurs like Jean Michel Jarre and Klaus Schulze were walling themselves in with banks and banks of synthesizers, computers and electronic gadgetry the KLF were doing the opposite—making a crafted work like Chill Out with the bare necessities of musical survival." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{had a large}} temple {{built in}} his hayfield, a hundred feet long and sixty wide. Everybody had to pay a temple fee. Thor was the god most honoured there. It was rounded on the inside, like a vault, and there were windows and wall-hangings everywhere. The image of Thor stood in the center, with other gods on both sides. In front of them was an altar made with great skill and covered with iron on the top. On this {{there was to be}} a fire which would never go outthey called it sacred fire. On the altar was to lie a great armband, made of silver. The temple godi was to wear it on his arm at all gatherings, and {{everyone}} was to swear oaths on it whenever a suit was brought. A great copper bowl was to stand on the altar, and into it was <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> blood which came from animals or men given to Thor. They called this sacrificial blood [...] and the sacrificial blood bowl [...] This blood was to be sprinkled over men and animals, and the animals that were given in sacrifice were to be used for feasting when sacrificial banquets were held.
