The project {{was to be a}} 50:50 partnership; the air forces of both countries would be committed to ordering the fighter. After GEC-Marconi had abandoned the bidding to supply an integrated avionics suite, FIAR and Thomson-CSF proposed a number of avionics suites based on the Grifo S7 and RC400 radars respectively, despite previously hoping to use the PAF's Super 7 to launch its new Blue Hawk radar. Because of sanctions placed on Pakistan after the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests, design work progressed very slowly over the next 18 months, preventing delivery of the Western avionics to the PAF. In early 2001, the PAF decided <b>to</b> <b>decouple</b> the airframe from the avionics, enabling design work on the aircraft to continue. As the airframe was developed, any new avionics requirements by the PAF could be more easily integrated into the airframe.|$|E

Around 10:30UTC on June8, Blanca made landfall over Isla Santa Margarita {{off the coast of}} Baja California Sur before striking the mainland, near Puerto Argudin, at 11:15UTC. This marked the earliest known landfall in the state, and peninsula, on record during a calendar year. It surpassed the previous earliest—Tropical Storm Calvin on July8, 1993—by a month. Turning back to the northwest, the system briefly emerged back over the Pacific Ocean before weakening to a tropical depression. Blanca made its third and final landfall near El Patrocinio around 20:30UTC. With deep convection no longer present, the depression degraded into a remnant low early on June9 over the central Baja California peninsula before dissipating hours later.|$|E

The paper analyses a sample of 248 farm-households located in 8 EU countries, using decision tree algorithms to explain stated reactions <b>to</b> <b>decoupling</b> in terms of change in on-farm investment. The factors emerging as determinants of an increase in on-farm investment as a reaction <b>to</b> <b>decoupling</b> are the existence of a successor, the farmer's age, farm size, and whether the head of the farm works part-time or full-time. Allowing for the use of country variables, these tend to account already for the factors listed above and become the main predictors, followed by labour endowment, specialisation and expectations. While the study confirms the relevance of the main determinants available from the literature, it also emphasises the articulation of the effects of farm head age and labour management on the reaction <b>to</b> <b>decoupling.</b> This hints at the need for further research into the way such factors combine in determining farm-household reactions to a changing market and policy context and support the usefulness of non-parametric statistics tools for analysis.

500|$|Animal Rights Without Liberation seeks <b>to</b> <b>decouple</b> {{animal rights}} from animal liberation. For Cochrane, of central {{importance}} {{is the question}} of sentience, understood as [...] "the capacity for phenomenal consciousness". No position is taken on precisely how many animals are sentient, but, Cochrane argues, it is clear that at least some nonhuman animals are. Sentience alone does not afford moral status, but sentience implies the capacity for well-being; sentient beings have lives that can go better or worse for them. Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant argued that personhood is required for moral value, but Cochrane observes that there may be nonhuman animals who could be considered persons. In any case, it is argued that there are good reasons not to agree with Kant, and Cochrane concludes that {{there is no reason to}} limit the possession of moral status to humans. What needs to be considered is not whether anything is owed to animals, but what is owed to them. Following a paper on animal rights by political philosopher Joel Feinberg, Cochrane suggests that animals possess rights on account of their interests. Cochrane then deals with four possible objections. Interest rights are defended against the claim that moral agency is a prerequisite of rights-possession, against the demand that rights be derived from social relations, against the suggestion, from R. G. Frey, that animals do not possess interests, and against the idea that inanimate entities and plants may possess interests.|$|E
500|$|After leaving Eastern Micronesia, Bavi {{continued}} to move westwards {{and threatened to}} impact the Mariana Islands as a typhoon. As a result the Guam Weather Forecast Office issued a typhoon watch and a tropical storm warning for Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan during March 13. The islands were also placed in Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness 1 by Governors Eddie Calvo, Eloy Inos and Rear Admiral Bette Bolivar. The Guam Waterworks Authority advised residents on the island stock up on water ahead of the system, in case Bavi disrupted the island's water service. United Airlines, Cape Air and United Express all cancelled flights that departed from Guam, while schools were shut on the island during March 15. However, as Bavi approached the islands, upper level wind shear caused the system <b>to</b> <b>decouple</b> and start to gradually weaken. Bavi's circulation subsequently passed over Guam during March 15, with winds on the island barely reaching gale force on the island. Within Guam, sporadic power outages and minor tree damage were reported, while waves on the uninhabited northeastern coast of Guam reached [...] and were the highest waves recorded on the island in a decade. A band of showers associated with the system and a pressure gradient, between Bavi and an area of high pressure, brought winds of up to [...] to Saipan and Tinian. As a result several trees and power lines were brought down across the islands, which resulted in Saipan having sporadic power outages and temporarily losing all electric. Around 65 homes which were primarily constructed with wood and tin were affected by the winds, with 5 destroyed while a further 52 sustained some damage. The local Red Cross chapter subsequently provided tarpaulins, cleaning materials and over $25,000 in assistance to 252people, while total property damages within the Mariana Islands were estimated at around US$150thousand.|$|E
40|$|According to neo-classical theory, farm operators’ labour {{allocation}} {{is determined}} by the relative wage they can earn from their labour on and off the farm. At the equilibrium, time should be allocated so that the marginal returns from on- and off-farm work are equal. Thus, a move from coupled <b>to</b> <b>decoupled</b> payments should have important impacts on labour allocation, as it reduces the return to farm labour and increases the unearned income of operators.
