50|$|The twofold {{proficiency}} has {{the characteristic}} of healthiness of <b>the</b> mental <b>body</b> <b>and</b> consciousness, respectively. Its {{function is to}} crush unhealthiness of <b>the</b> mental <b>body</b> <b>and</b> consciousness. It is manifested as absence of disability. Its proximate cause is <b>the</b> mental <b>body</b> <b>and</b> consciousness.

50|$|Rectitude is straightness. The twofold rectitude has the {{characteristic}} of uprightness of <b>the</b> mental <b>body</b> <b>and</b> consciousness, respectively.

Its proximate cause is <b>the</b> mental <b>body</b> <b>and</b> consciousness.

5|$|The heart {{functions}} as a pump in the circulatory system to provide a continuous flow of blood throughout the body. This circulation consists of the systemic circulation to and from <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> the pulmonary circulation {{to and from the}} lungs. Blood in the pulmonary circulation exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen in the lungs through the process of respiration. The systemic circulation then transports oxygen to <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated blood to the heart for transfer to the lungs.|$|E
5|$|The wings lie flat on <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> {{are very}} {{variable}} in size between species, being reduced in size in some crickets and missing in others. The fore wings are elytra made of tough chitin, {{acting as a}} protective shield for the soft parts of <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> in males, bear the stridulatory organs {{for the production of}} sound. The hind pair is membranous, folding fan-wise under the fore wings. In many species, the wings are not adapted for flight.|$|E
5|$|Among vertebrates, the Australian {{frilled lizard}} (Chlamydosaurus kingii) has a startling display in which wide semicircular frills {{on either side}} of the head are fanned out; the mouth is opened wide exposing the gape; the tail is waved over <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> the body is raised, so that the animal appears as large and {{threatening}} as possible.|$|E
50|$|The twofold wieldiness has the {{characteristic}} of the subsiding of unwieldiness (akammaññabhāva) in <b>the</b> mental <b>body</b> <b>and</b> consciousness, respectively. Its function is to crush unwieldiness. It is manifested as success of <b>the</b> mental <b>body</b> <b>and</b> consciousness in making something an object. Its proximate cause is <b>the</b> mental <b>body</b> <b>and</b> consciousness. It {{should be regarded as}} opposed to the remaining hindrances, which create unwieldiness of <b>the</b> mental <b>body</b> <b>and</b> consciousness.|$|R

The Food and Drug Administration and other institutions have reviewed the issue and found no evidence to suggest toxicity in vivo.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} endopterygotes, beetle larvae pupate, and from these pupae emerge fully formed, sexually mature adult beetles, or imagos. Pupae never have mandibles (they are adecticous). In most pupae, the {{appendages}} are not attached to <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> {{are said to}} be exarate; in a few beetles (Staphylinidae, Ptiliidae etc.) the appendages are fused with the body (termed as obtect pupae).|$|E
5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or in contact with <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.|$|E

5|$|Both {{plant and}} animal life endemic to snow-bound areas develop ways to adapt. Among the {{adaptive}} mechanisms for plants are dormancy, seasonal dieback, survival of seeds; and for animals are hibernation, insulation, anti-freeze chemistry, storing food, drawing on reserves from within <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> clustering for mutual heat.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{the presence}} of acute thrombosis (a blood clot) in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs on one side of <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> seizures. The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by thrombus.|$|E
5|$|Chapters 5 and 6 {{discuss the}} means of {{cleansing}} <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> mind. The first ten verses of chapter 5 summarize and restate the need for always practicing virtuous self-restraints (Yamas), observances (Niyamas), avoiding anger against anyone or anything, truthfully following Dharma, respecting and learning from the Guru (teacher), and pursuing the proper goals of life without craving for rewards of one's action.|$|E

5|$|Dimetrodon was {{probably}} one of the apex predators of the Cisuralian ecosystems, feeding on fish and tetrapods, including reptiles and amphibians. Smaller Dimetrodon species may have had different ecological roles. The sail of Dimetrodon may have been used to stabilize its spine or to heat and cool its body as a form of thermoregulation. Some recent studies argue that the sail would have been ineffective at removing heat from <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> was most likely used in courtship display.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers may be {{confused}} with Ensifera (crickets, etc.), but they differ in many aspects; these include the number of segments in their antennae {{and the structure of}} the ovipositor, as well as the location of the tympanal organ and the methods by which sound is produced. Ensiferans have antennae that can be much longer than <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> have at least 20–24 segments, while caeliferans have fewer segments in their shorter, stouter antennae.|$|E

5|$|Horses have a {{great sense}} of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly {{developed}} proprioception—the unconscious sense of where <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> limbs are at all times.
