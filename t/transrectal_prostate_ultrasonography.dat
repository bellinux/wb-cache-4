40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} high energy transurethral microwave thermotherapy for treating urinary retention due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. Between October 1993 and March 1999, 41 patients with urinary retention were treated with high energy transurethral microwave thermotherapy. Initial evaluation consisted of a history, clinical examination, urethrocystoscopy, <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> and urodynamic investigation with a pressure flow study. Followup visits at 12, 26 and 52 weeks included International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS), uroflowmetry and post-void residual urine volume determination. At 26 weeks the urodynamic study was repeated. Kaplan-Meier plots were constructed to evaluate the risk of re-treatment adjusted for patients lost to followup. At baseline median patient age was 74 years and median prostate size was 67 ml. Median 133 kJ. were administered. Nine patients underwent re-treatment and 11 were lost to followup. The re-treatment rate after 1 year was 25 % (95 % confidence interval 11 to 40). In good responders at 12, 26 and 52 weeks median maximal urine free flow was 15, 11 and 15 ml. per second, post-void residual urine volume was 61, 8 and 35 ml., and I-PSS was 7, 5 and 2, respectively. Quality of life (I-PSS question 8) was 1 at all visits. In patients with severe co-morbidity transurethral microwave thermotherapy is often the only alternative to an indwelling catheter with obvious quality of life advantages.

40|$|Purpose: Chronic {{prostatitis}} (CP) /chronic {{pelvic pain}} syndrome (CPPS) {{has been studied}} mainly in adults; reports in adolescents are rare. We compared the clinical characteristics of adolescent CP/CPPS patients with those of young adults. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 20 adolescents with CP/CPPS aged < 20 years who visited our outpatient department from August 2005 to April 2012. The control group comprised 120 young adult CP/CPPS patients. A complete medical history, physical examination, {{the national institute of}} health-chronic prostatitis symptoms index (NIH-CPSI) questionnaire, urinalysis, expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) or semen analysis, <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasonography,</b> and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were performed. Based on the EPS or semen analysis, patients were divided into category III-A or III-B. Results: The mean age was 16. 5 ± 2. 0 and 32. 8 ± 5. 0 years in the adolescent and control groups, respectively. A sexual activity history was seen in 2 patients; 9 and 11 patients were in category III-A and III-B, respectively. The PSA was 0. 65 ± 0. 39 and 1. 22 ± 0. 48 ng/ mL in the adolescent and control groups, respectively. The prostate size was 12. 4 ± 4. 4 and 21. 0 ± 4. 9 g in the adolescent and control groups, respectively. The NIH-CPSI scores in the adolescent group were 9. 2 ± 5. 2, 5. 5 ± 3. 5, 7. 5 ± 3. 2, and 22. 2 ± 8. 1 for pain, voiding, quality of life (QoL) domains, and total scores, respectively. The adolescent group showed a tendency to exhibit high voiding symptom scores. Conclusions: CPPS has an equally severe impact on QoL in adults and adolescents. Apart from high voiding symptom scores in adolescents, no difference was found in terms of urologic clinical parameters...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The role of IGF-I in {{prostate}} {{development is}} currently under thorough investigation {{since it has}} been claimed that IGF-I is a positive predictor of prostate cancer. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of chronic GH and IGF-I deficiency alone or associated with testosterone deficiency on prostate pathophysiology {{in a series of}} patients with hypopituitarism. DESIGN: Pituitary, androgen and prostate hormonal assessments and <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> (TRUS) were performed in 30 men with adulthood onset GH deficiency (GHD) and 30 age-matched healthy controls, free from previous or concomitant prostate disorders. RESULTS: Plasma IGF-I levels were significantly lower in GHD patients than in controls (Pearson's coefficient P 30 ml) was significantly lower in hypogonadal and eugonadal GHD patients, without any difference between them (15. 3 % and 5. 8 %), than in controls (43. 3 %) (chi(2) = 6. 90, P= 0. 005). No difference was found in PV between patients with normal or deficient IGF-I levels both in the hypogonadal group (19. 9 +/- 4. 7 vs 17. 3 +/- 4. 0 ml) and in the eugonadal group (22. 6 +/- 2. 3 vs 21. 8 +/- 2. 5 ml). When controls and patients were divided according to age (60 years), PV was significantly lower in hypogonadal GHD patients aged below 60 years than in age-matched controls (P< 0. 01) or eugonadal GHD patients (P< 0. 01), without any difference between controls and eugonadal GHD patients. Controls aged above 60 years had significantly higher PV than both hypogonadal and eugonadal GHD patients (P< 0. 01). Calcifications, cysts or nodules were found in 56. 7 % of patients and in 50 % of controls (chi(2) = 0. 067, P= 0. 79). In controls, but not in GHD patients, PV and TZV were correlated with age (r= 0. 82, r= 0. 46, P< 0. 0001 and P< 0. 01 respectively). PV was also correlated with GH (r=- 0. 52, P= 0. 0026), IGF-I (r=- 0. 62, P= 0. 0002) and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP- 3) levels (r=- 0. 39, P= 0. 032) but neither with testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels. In GHD patients TZV but not PV was correlated with age (r= 0. 58, P= 0. 0007) and neither TZV nor PV were correlated with GH, IGF-I or IGFBP- 3 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic GH deficiency in adulthood causes a decrease in prostate size, mostly in patients with concomitant androgen deficiency and age below 60 years, without significant changes in the prevalence of structural prostate abnormalities...|$|E

40|$|Harm {{caused by}} {{preventive}} programs may be physical, psychological, social or, if informed consent {{has not been}} obtained, ethical. Adverse effects of preventive screening programs may occur {{at any of the}} three levels of the "screening cascade", the screening procedure itself, the investigation of abnormal results of screening tests or the treatment of detected abnormalities or diseases. The greatest harm occurs at the second and third levels. Examples of procedures that may cause physical harm are venipuncture, mammography, colonoscopy, breast biopsy, <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasonography,</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy, weight-reducing and cholesterol-lowering diets and radical prostatectomy. The psychological and social harm of preventive programs involves anticipated discomfort or perception of adverse effects of preventive interventions; unpleasant interactions with health care workers, time required for preventive programs, excessive overall awareness of health, anxiety over the results of a screening test implications of a positive screening test, consequences of being labelled as "sick" or "at risk," psychopathologic effects induced directly by preventive programs and, {{in the case of a}} false-negative test result, false assurance of disease-free status. Since the positive predictive value of screening tests in the general population is always low, most abnormal test results are "false-positive," these engender a great deal of psychological discuss among patients...|$|R
40|$|In {{experimental}} models, prolactin (PRL) displays independent hypertrophic {{effects on}} the prostate. To investigate whether hyperprolactinemia is associated with prostate enlargement in humans, we designed this open, prospective, case-control study enrolling 20 men with prolactinoma (aged 34 +/- 10 yr) and 20 age-matched healthy men. The endocrine profile and <b>prostate</b> <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> were performed before and after 12 and 24 months of cabergoline treatment in the patients and at study entry and after 24 months in the controls. The patients had lower serum testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and IGF-I levels and prostate volume (15. 4 +/- 3. 5 vs. 19. 6 +/- 5. 1 ml; P < 0. 001) and higher PRL levels and prostate-specific antigen density than controls. There {{was no difference in}} prostate and transitional zone volumes between patients with normoandrogenemia (n = 8) or hypoandrogenemia (n = 12). After 12 and 24 months of treatment, PRL, testosterone, and DHT levels were normal in all cases, as were IGF-I and IGF-binding protein- 3 levels. After 24 months, prostate volume was comparable to that in controls (21. 7 +/- 4. 5 vs. 22. 5 +/- 4. 7 ml). There were no changes in prostate structure throughout the study period in either the patients or the controls. In conclusion, in young men with prolactinoma PRL excess is unlikely to have {{effects on the}} prostate per se, because it is accompanied by low testosterone and DHT levels that produce the major effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of febrile {{urinary tract infection}} after <b>transrectal</b> ultrasonography-guided <b>prostate</b> biopsy {{has been reported to}} range from 0. 1 % to 7 %, with Escherichia coli being the most common organism identified. The conventional wisdom is to recommend an interval of more than 4 to 6 weeks after the <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy before treating patients with radical prostatectomy. This allows time for resolution of the biopsy-induced inflammation, which might complicate the surgical planes for dissection. We present a 58 -year-old man with an elevated prostate-specific antigen, who developed near-fatal sepsis following <b>transrectal</b> ultrasonography-guided <b>prostate</b> biopsy despite quinolone prophylaxis.

40|$|Objectives To {{examine the}} {{usefulness}} of an absorbable hemostatic gelatin sponge for hemostasis after <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> needle biopsy. Subjects and Methods The subjects comprised 278 participants who underwent <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> needle biopsy. They were randomly allocated to the gelatin sponge insertion group (group A: 148 participants) and to the non-insertion group (group B: 130 participants). In group A, the gelatin sponge was inserted into the rectum immediately after biopsy. A biopsy-induced hemorrhage {{was defined as a}} case in which a subject complained of bleeding from the rectum, and excretion of blood clots was confirmed. A blood test was performed before and after biopsy, and a questionnaire survey was given after the biopsy. Results Significantly fewer participants in group A required hemostasis after biopsy compared to group B (3 (2. 0 %) vs. 11 (8. 5 %), P= 0. 029). The results of the blood tests and the responses from the questionnaire did not differ significantly between the two groups. In multivariate analysis, only &# 8220;insertion of a gelatin sponge into the rectum&# 8221; emerged as a significant predictor of hemostasis. Conclusion Insertion of a gelatin sponge into the rectum after <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> needle biopsy significantly increases hemostasis without increasing patient symptoms, such as pain and a sense of discomfort...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} intrarectal lidocaine hydrochloride gel in reducing pain in patients undergoing <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the period from June to Noviber 2002, 72 patients undergoing <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy at an outpatient service were prospectively randomized. Patients were divided into 2 groups. In group 1, 20 mL of 2 % lidocaine gel were administered by intrarectal route 15 minutes before biopsy. In group 2 (placebo), 20 mL of ultrasound gel were administered under the same conditions. At {{the end of the}} procedure, patients were asked to classify the discomfort degree observed during the procedure through a verbal pain scale. Statistical analysis was performed through qui-square test. RESULTS: The majority of patients in both groups presented slight pain on the examination, and 26 patients (76. 4 %) from group 1, and 26 (68. 3 %) patients from group 2 reported slight pain or no pain at all (p > 0. 05). Moderate or intense pain was felt by 23. 4 % of patients in group 1 and 31. 5 % of patients in group 2 (p > 0. 05).

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the incidence, clinical features, pathogenic bacteria, and risk {{factors associated with}} acute prostatitis after <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 923 transrectal ultrasound-guided needle biopsies of the prostate in 878 patients performed at our institution from June 2004 to May 2009. The indications for biopsy were generally serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) elevation, abnormal findings on a digital rectal examination, or both. All biopsies were performed with the patient hospitalized except for 10 patients who refused to be hospitalized, and ciprofloxacin was administered as an antibiotic prophylaxis. The incidence, clinical features, pathogenic bacteria, and potential risk factors associated with acute prostatitis after prostate biopsy were evaluated. Results: Acute prostatitis developed in 18 (2. 0 %) cases after prostate biopsy. Among them, 9 (1. 0 %) had bacteremia and 2 (0. 2 %) showed clinical features of sepsis. Of the total 50 urine or blood specimens sent for culture study, 27 (54. 0 %) specimens showed positive cultures, including E. coli in 25. Among the 27 culture-positive specimens, 26 (96. 3 %) were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Among the potential risk factors for acute prostatitis after prostate biopsy, biopsy performed as an outpatient procedure without a cleansing enema (p= 0. 001) and past history of cerebrovascular accident (p= 0. 048) were statistically significant. Conclusions: Fluoroquinolone is effective as an antibiotic prophylaxis for <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy in most cases. The incidence of acute prostatitis after <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy was 2. 0 %, and almost all cases were caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli.

Patients had history taken, physical examination by digital rectal examination (DRE) of the prostate, assessment of total and free serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, <b>prostate</b> <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> (TRUS), and TRIMprob test. Indications for prostate biopsy included {{one or more of the}} following conditions: total serum PSA levels of 4. 0 ng/mL or more, free/total serum PSA ratio of 0. 18 or less, positive results on DRE, and suspicious findings on TRUS. Twelve-core, TRUS-guided biopsies were performed with local anesthesia. A blinded investigator performed the TRIMprob test; the lowest value of the signal at 465 MHz was looked for and recorded, although data of the electromagnetic signal at 930 and 1295 MHz were also recorded. RESULTS One hundred eleven patients (aged 64. 9 8. 1 years, mean standard deviation), enrolled between November 2004 and August 2005, were analyzed. Total serum PSA level was 8. 4 3. 6 ng/mL, and free/total serum PSA ratio was 0. 15 0. 7.

40|$|Purpose: Although <b>transrectal</b> ultrasound-guided <b>prostate</b> biopsy {{is useful}} for {{diagnosing}} prostate cancer, it is a painful procedure. There are many methods for providing pain relief and for treating discomfort during the procedure, but occasionally these are reported to be of limited use. We aimed to evaluate the value and safety of midazolam-induced anesthetic <b>transrectal</b> ultrasound-guided <b>prostate</b> biopsy. Materials and Methods: From August 2008 to December 2009, 104 male patients, who were examined with <b>transrectal</b> ultrasound-guided <b>prostate</b> 12 -core biopsy, {{were randomly assigned to}} two groups. Group 1 (n= 51) received ketorolac (Tarasyn Ⓡ) 30 mg. Group 2 (n= 53) was treated with midazolam (Dormicum Ⓡ) 3 mg, which was increased to 5 mg if necessary. Immediately after the procedure, the patients were asked to rate their comfort level by using a 10 -point visual analog self-assessment pain scale. Results: The pain scale in group 2 was significantly lower than that in group 1 (p< 0. 05). The patients assigned to group 2 experienced no side-effects from midazolam and were more satisfied than the patients in group 1 (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: Midazolam anesthesia relieves pain effectively, and the patient’s satisfaction is better than with conventional <b>transrectal</b> ultrasound-guided <b>prostate</b> biopsy. Midazolam-induced anesthetic <b>transrectal</b> ultrasound-guided <b>prostate</b> biopsy is useful and safe.

40|$|A 58 -year-old {{physician}} with {{an elevated}} prostate specific antigen developed severe septic shock following a repeat <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy despite standard preoperative prophylactic protocol. This case highlights {{the significance of}} harbouring antibiotic-resistant bacteria {{and the risk of}} previous quinolone exposure. We believe this case may herald a rare but potentially serious consequence of increasingly common antibiotic resistance and that high-risk patients should be studied to determine their likelihood of carrying antibiotic-resistant flora in their genitourinary/gastrointestinal tract...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and Hypothesis: We {{retrospectively}} {{evaluated the}} prognostic impact of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) {{as a marker}} for inflammatory and immune state in men with prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: This retrospective {{study was conducted in}} a single urology clinic to review the medical data of 558 patients who underwent <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> needle biopsies between 2007 and 2014. Prior to <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> needle biopsies, patient histories, physical examinations, and routine laboratory tests including blood biochemistry, urinaly- sis and urine cultures, free PSA and total PSA, rectal examination, transrectal ultrasound findings, and pathology results were evaluated. Results: Benign biopsy results were found in 287 patients (Group 1) using neutrophil / lymphocyte (NLR) and platelet / lymphocyte ratio (PLR). When calculating malignancy in 271 patients (Group 2), there was no significantly difference in NLR and PLR values between benign and malign prostate diseases (p= 0. 14 and p= 0. 369, respectively). Conclusion: With reference to the survey prior to the biopsy, NLR and PLR ratio values {{do not appear to be}} helpful in the differentiation of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{feasibility}} of a 2 nd generation MR-compatible, remote-controlled manipulator (RCM) {{as an aid to}} perform MR-guided <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy in males with suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa). METHODS: This prospective phase I study was approved by the local ethical committee and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Twenty patients with >/= 1 cancer suspicious region (CSR) with a PI-RADS score of >/= 3 detected on the diagnostic multi-parametric MRI and no prior prostate treatment underwent MR-guided biopsy with the aid of the RCM. Complications were classified according to the modified Clavien system for reporting surgical complications. For evaluation of the workflow, procedure- and manipulation times were recorded. RESULTS: All CSR's (n= 20) were reachable with the MR-compatible RCM and the cancer detection rate was 70 %. The median procedure time was 36 : 44 minutes (range, 23 - 61 minutes) and the median manipulation time for needle guide movement was 5 : 48 minutes (range, 1 : 15 - 18 : 35 minutes). Two Clavien grade 1 complications were reported. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible and safe to perform <b>transrectal</b> MR-guided <b>prostate</b> biopsy using a MR-compatible RCM as an aid. It is a fast and efficient way to biopsy suspicious prostate lesions with a minimum number of biopsies per patient. KEY POINTS: * It is feasible to perform <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy using a MR-compatible RCM. * Using a RCM for MR-guided biopsy is safe, fast, and efficient. * All cancer suspicious regions were reachable with the RCM...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To present our {{clinical}} experience about infective complications due to ultrasound guided <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy under ciprofloxacin plus third-generation cephalosporin (Ceftriaxone) combination prophylaxis. Material and Method: The 1193 patients that used combination of ceftriaxone 1 g intramuscular 1 hour before biopsy and ciprofloxacin 500 mg {{twice a day}} for 5 days after biopsy were included to study. Before biopsy, urine analysis and urinary cultures were not performed routinely. Serious infective complications such as acute prostatitis and urosepsis, causing microorganisms were evaluated. Results: Serious infective complications occurred in (1. 3 %) 16 patients. Fifteen of them had acute prostatitis and urine culture results were positive in 10 / 15 patients for Escherichia coli. The strains were uniformly resistant to ciprofloxacin. Only 1 patient had urosepsis and his blood and urine cultures demonstrated extended- spectrum %u 03 B 2 -lactamase-producing (ESBL) Escherichia coli also resistant to ciprofloxacin. Antibiotic treatment-related side effects were not observed in any patient. Discussion: Although {{there is not a}} certain procedure, ciprofloxacin is the most common used antibiotic for <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy prophylaxis. On the other hand, the incidence of ciprofloxacin resistant Escherichia coli strain is increasing. Thus, new prophylaxis strategies have to be discussed. Ceftriaxone plus ciprofloxacin prophylaxis is safe and can be useable option for prophylaxis of prostate biopsy...|$|R

Background. <b>Transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy is the standard protocol for the screening for prostate cancer. It helps to locate prostatic adenocarcinoma and plan treatment. However, {{the increasing number of}} prostate biopsies leads to considerably greater costs for the pathology laboratories. In this study, we compare the traditional method with an ink method in combination with a systematic histopathologic protocol. Methods. Two hundred consecutive <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy specimens were received from the radiology department. They were separated into two groups: one hundred were processed as six different specimens in the usual manner. The other one hundred were submitted in six containers, the apex, base, and middle section of which were stained different colours. The samples subject to the ink method were embedded in paraffin and placed in two cassettes which were sectioned using a specific protocol. Results. The comparative study of the nonink and ink methods for histopathologic diagnosis showed no statistical differences as far as diagnostic categories were concerned (P value <. 005).
