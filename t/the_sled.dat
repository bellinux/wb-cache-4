5|$|In the two-woman event, {{defending}} {{world champion}} Nicole Minichiello of Britain had her sled flip over after turn 12 {{during the third}} run, but both Minichiello and her brakeman Gillian Cooke {{walked away from the}} crash. Minichiello and Cooke decided not to start the final run. In the final run, Russia-2's sled crashed which kept them at their finishing position of 18th. Meanwhile, the Germany-2 sled of Cathleen Martini and Romy Logsch was in fourth place after the third run, but was disqualified after Martini crashed in turn 13 of the final run, causing Logsch to be ejected from <b>the</b> <b>sled.</b> Both Martini and Logsch walked away from the crash by themselves. Before this incident, Martini had never crashed before in her career. Canada's Kaillie Humphries and Heather Moyse won the event.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the very}} few {{confirmed}} attacks on humans by wild killer whales, none have been fatal. In one instance, killer whales tried to tip ice floes on which a dog team and photographer of the Terra Nova Expedition were standing. <b>The</b> <b>sled</b> dogs' barking is speculated to have sounded enough like seal calls to trigger the killer whale's hunting curiosity. In the 1970s, a surfer in California was bitten, and in 2005, a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbor seals was bumped by a killer whale that apparently misidentified him as prey. Unlike wild killer whales, captive killer whales are reported to have made nearly two dozen attacks on humans since the 1970s, {{some of which have}} been fatal.|$|E
25|$|A {{flexible}} flyer or steel runner sled is a steerable wooden sled {{with thin}} metal runners whereby a rider may sit upright on <b>the</b> <b>sled</b> or lie on their stomach, allowing {{the possibility to}} descend a snowy slope feet-first or head-first. To steer <b>the</b> <b>sled,</b> the rider may either push on the wooden cross piece with their hands or feet, or pull on the rope attached to the wooden cross-piece. The flexible flyer was invented in 1889 by Philadelphia resident Samuel Leeds Allen. U.S. patent #408,681 was issued to Allen on August 13, 1889.|$|E
50|$|After {{the race}} completes, {{racehorses}} are freed from <b>the</b> <b>sleds</b> {{and led to}} the back yard, while <b>the</b> <b>sleds</b> are returned to the starting gate {{with the aid of a}} trolley.|$|R
60|$|The young hunters {{had tied}} long ropes to <b>the</b> <b>sleds,</b> and while Whopper and Shep pulled one turnout, Snap and Giant dragged <b>the</b> other. <b>The</b> <b>sleds</b> had {{polished}} runners, and slid {{over the river}} surface so easily that pulling was more sport than work.|$|R
50|$|The {{greatest}} operational difficulty was on downhill grades where ice allowed <b>the</b> <b>sleds</b> {{to accelerate}} faster than <b>the</b> engine. Jack-knifing <b>sleds</b> pushed many log haulers into trees, and most photos of log haulers show rebuilt cabs and bent ironwork on the boiler and saddle tank. Hay was {{spread over the}} downhill routes {{in an effort to}} increase friction under <b>the</b> <b>sleds,</b> but hungry deer sometimes consumed the hay before the train arrived.|$|R
25|$|Dog {{team members}} are given titles {{according}} to {{their position in the}} team relative to <b>the</b> <b>sled.</b> These include leaders or lead dogs, swing dogs, team dogs, and wheelers or wheel dogs.|$|E
25|$|Slobbovian Sled Run - This was {{introduced}} in the 1977 season. Guests rode on sleds mounted on teflon runners. <b>The</b> <b>sled</b> run was intended to operate similarly to a waterslide but without water.|$|E
25|$|Nikolai, an Athabaskan {{settlement}} {{on the banks}} of the Kuskokwim River, is the first Native American village used as a checkpoint, and the arrival of <b>the</b> <b>sled</b> teams is one of the largest social events of the year. The route then follows the south fork of the Kuskokwim to the former mining town of McGrath. According to the 2000 census, it has a population of 401, making it the largest checkpoint in the Interior. McGrath is also notable for being the first site in Alaska to receive mail by aircraft (in 1924), heralding the end of <b>the</b> <b>sled</b> dog era. It still has a good airfield, so journalists are common.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} <b>the</b> two <b>sleds,</b> with <b>the</b> dogs in harness, loaded with furs and fish. His rifle lay {{on top of}} the beaver skins. The six hunters who were to act as his guard stood by <b>the</b> <b>sleds.</b>|$|R

25|$|Constructing {{the pyramids}} {{involved}} moving huge quantities of stone. The quarried blocks were likely {{transported to the}} construction site by wooden sleds, with sand in front of <b>the</b> <b>sled</b> wetted to reduce friction. Droplets of water created bridges between the grains of sand, helping them stick together.|$|E
25|$|In 1759, the British army {{defeated}} the French at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham {{and control the}} Canadian Shield. Many coureurs des bois accepted the British rule and continued to use <b>the</b> <b>sled</b> dog. The French term Marche! becomes Mush! in English.|$|E
25|$|Crosscut sled: A {{crosscut}} sled {{is generally}} {{used to hold}} the workpiece at a fixed 90 degree angle to the blade, allowing precise repeatable cuts at {{the most commonly used}} angle. <b>The</b> <b>sled</b> is normally guided by a runner fastened under it that slides in a miter slot. This device is normally shop made, but can be purchased.|$|E

25|$|Mrs. Chippy was {{the ship}}'s cat aboard Endurance, the ship used by Sir Ernest Shackleton for his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. When {{the ship was}} lost, having become trapped and {{eventually}} crushed in pack ice, Shackleton ordered <b>the</b> <b>sled</b> dogs and Mrs. Chippy shot, as Shackleton had decided that the animals could not be kept during the arduous journey ahead.|$|E
25|$|There are {{occasional}} {{accounts of}} Europeans travelling {{in remote areas}} (outside of Europe) who get lost and have to eat their companion dog to survive. The explorer Benedict Allen claims to have done this, and a case in Canada was reported in 2013. This is distinct from Arctic and Antarctic expeditions, where <b>the</b> <b>sled</b> dogs were factored into the rations.|$|E
25|$|Green Crag can be {{climbed from}} the Birker Fell Road, {{where there are}} some {{suitable}} off-road spaces for parking. From Eskdale the best access is via <b>the</b> <b>sled</b> gate (i.e. path used for dragging peat on sleds) which climbs near Birker Force. The plateau can also be reached {{in the vicinity of}} Kepple Crag. From the Duddon there are waymarked paths through the conifer plantations, beginning at the various Forestry car-parks.|$|E
60|$|In half an {{hour the}} full chorus of yelps, barks and howls swelled hideously on the air, and the ever {{increasing}} pack of wolves could be seen scarcely a hundred yards behind <b>the</b> <b>sleds.</b> <b>The</b> patter of their swiftly flying feet on the snow could be distinctly heard. The slender, dark forms came nearer and nearer every moment. Presently the wolves had approached close enough for the occupants of <b>the</b> <b>sleds</b> to see their shining eyes looking like little balls of green fire. A gaunt beast bolder than the others, and evidently {{the leader of the}} pack, bounded forward until he was only a few yards from <b>the</b> last <b>sled.</b> At every jump he opened his great jaws and uttered a quick bark as if to embolden his followers.|$|R

60|$|The young hunters {{looked around}} for more deer but none were in that {{vicinity}} and so they returned to where they had left <b>the</b> <b>sleds.</b>|$|R
25|$|A hybrid {{design of}} the sled-foot trestle and the post and rail styles can work well. Instead of an 'I' structure, <b>the</b> <b>sled</b> foot is moved up to become a rail - sort of an 'H' with a bar across the top. This puts end-grain on the floor, but it is {{otherwise}} a strong design and somewhat easier to build. Plus, the feet don't {{get in the way}} of the work as sled-feet sometimes do.|$|E
25|$|Buck's next {{owners are}} {{a trio of}} stampeders (Hal, Charles, and a woman named Mercedes from the United States), who are inexperienced at {{surviving}} in the Northern wilderness. They struggle to control <b>the</b> <b>sled</b> and ignore warnings that the spring melt poses dangers. They overfeed the dogs and then starve them when the food runs out. On their journey they meet John Thornton, an experienced outdoorsman, who notices the dogs have been poorly treated and are in a weakened condition. He warns the trio against crossing the river, but they ignore his advice and order Buck to move on. Exhausted, starving, and sensing the danger ahead, Buck refuses and continues to lie unmoving in the snow. After Buck is beaten by Hal, Thornton recognizes {{him to be a}} remarkable dog. Disgusted by the driver's treatment of Buck, Thornton hits Hal with the butt of his axe, cuts Buck free from his traces, and tells the trio he is keeping him, much to Hal's displeasure. After some argument, the trio leaves and tries to cross the river, but as Thornton warned, the ice breaks, and the three fall into the river and drown, along with <b>the</b> <b>sled</b> and neglected dogs.|$|E
25|$|He {{was elected}} to the Legislative Assembly from the riding of Kamloops-North Thompson in the 2009 provincial election. In the 39th Parliament of British Columbia, Lake was not named to Premier Gordon Campbell's cabinet, but he was {{appointed}} Parliamentary Secretary for the Ranching Task Force and, following that task force's work, Lake was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Health Promotion. Lake also chaired <b>the</b> <b>Sled</b> Dog Task Force. Once Christy Clark became premier she appointed Lake, on March 14, 2011, the Minister of Environment.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>sled</b> dog was {{the primary}} means of {{transportation}} and communication in subarctic communities around the world, and the race became both the last great hurrah and the most famous event {{in the history of}} mushing, before the first aircraft in the 1930s and then the snowmobile in the 1960s drove the dog sled almost into extinction. The resurgence of recreational mushing in Alaska since the 1970s {{is a direct result of}} the tremendous popularity of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which honors the history of dog mushing.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>sled</b> {{driver of}} the final leg of the relay was the Norwegian-born Gunnar Kaasen; his lead sled dog was Balto. A statue of Balto by F.G. Roth stands near the zoo in Central Park, New York City. Leonhard Seppala ran the penultimate, and longest, leg of the 1925 serum run to Nome. One of his dogs, Togo, is {{considered}} the forgotten hero of the Great Race of Mercy; another of his dogs, Fritz, is preserved and {{on display at the}} Carrie M. McLain Memorial Museum in Nome.|$|E
25|$|Three {{days after}} {{starting}} out and having reached firmer ice, the vehicular expedition's speed began to reduce drastically {{as they began}} encountering difficult terrain. From this point on, the expedition {{had to rely on}} their guides to scout ahead for a safe routes, with some routes proving impossible to proceed down and forcing the team to backtrack. Extensive delays over the next two days saw <b>the</b> <b>sled</b> team catch-up, although Hammond admits that the physical and mental strain is already starting to take its toll on his health.|$|E
