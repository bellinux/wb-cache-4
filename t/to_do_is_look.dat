[...] According to Gérard Prunier, a staffer to the Assistant Secretary said that [...] "the only thing we have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>look</b> the other way", with respect to Rwanda's continued intervention. New York Times correspondent Howard W. French said that according to his sources, Rice herself made the remark. The Congo Wars spearheaded by Rwanda led to over five million deaths. In 2012, when serving as UN ambassador, Rice opposed efforts to publicly censure Rwandan President Paul Kagame for again supporting a Congolese rebel group, {{this time in the}} 2012 Congo conflict, despite the sacking of the regional capital of Goma. The Rwandan government was a client when Rice worked at Intellibridge in 2001–02.|$|E

Bowie and his associates gave a more than hour-long display of his latest incarnation, and the music turned out to be nearly unlistenable." ...|$|R

5000|$|Two of {{the stars}} in the Big Dipper line up very closely with and point to Polaris. Polaris is a {{circumpolar}} star, and so it is always seen pretty close to the direction of true north. Hence, according to a popular myth, all slaves had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>look</b> for the Drinking Gourd and follow it to the North Star (Polaris) north to freedom. James Kelley has argued against the historicity of this interpretation in the Journal of Popular Culture.|$|R

But so far they've not succeeded in catching him. And as for young things, you know how filled the world is with them for a man like him. Think it over, and just keep your heart-thoughts away from him. If you don't let your heart start to warm toward him, it will save your heart from a grievous chill later on." ...|$|E

The film was declared a super hit in the first week, breaking the record in Malayalam cinema for opening week gross income, {{though it was not}} received well critically. It was said of Saran that all she had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>look</b> pretty. She then enacted her first lead role in a Telugu film after five years, in the commercially successful action-comedy Don Seenu opposite Ravi Teja, where she plays the sister of a mobster. In the opinion of some critics, she stole the show with her dances and romantic scenes.|$|R

60|$|So I bade {{farewell}} {{for ever}} to the adventure-path, {{and went out}} to the power plant of one of our Oakland street railways. I saw the superintendent himself, in a private office so fine that it almost stunned me. But I talked straight up. I told him I wanted to become a practical electrician, that I was unafraid of work, that I was used to hard work, and that all he had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>look</b> at me <b>to</b> see I was fit and strong.

In addition to bringing her {{closer to her}} family (Algonquin is a short drive from Chicago), the move also served a practical purpose: [...] "When I lived in California I’d return to Chicago and take photos so I could keep the images fresh," [...] she later recalled. [...] "It’s easier now that I’m in the city--all I have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>look</b> out the window." [...] Her fifth novel, The Good Boy, was released in November, 2013.|$|E
5000|$|In later years, Davis {{was linked}} to {{takeover}} targets including Northwest Airlines, US Airways, CBS, NBC and T. Boone Pickens' Mesa.

The bill, SB 1406, permits Arizona to work with other border states in constructing a privately funded border fence, hailed as a major step in enforcing national security. [...] "The federal government has put states like Arizona on the back burner for far too long, making flawed claims that the border has never been more secure," [...] said Sen.

5000|$|Clark noted, [...] "You have a {{lot more}} leeway with a defense {{attorney}} than with a prosecutor ... The prosecution has to go with the evidence and the facts and tell the story as it happened. The defense has more creative freedom. All you have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>look</b> for a defense that works. But it doesn't have to be the truth." [...] She also said of Samantha, [...] "The fact that she is a defense attorney creates a lot of new possibilities for me as a writer.

5000|$|The Councils {{continued}} rallying,creating of submissions {{and discussions}} with government officials {{resulted in the}} provision of the Prostitution Act 1999. The Act created the State's first legal boutique brothels which could be legally established by a person with no criminal convictions in commercial or industrial areas, have a maximum of five rooms and which could employ two to ten staff.The 1999 Act proved effective for The Queensland Sex Industry and Terry O'Gorman stated in an interview in 2005 with the ABC, on Tasmania's re-working of the Sex Industry Offences Act,"What the Tasmanian Parliament have got <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>look</b> at other models that have worked well in Australia, particularly the Queensland model, where you've got state approved brothels where prostitution in those circumstances are legal," [...] he said.|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{opinion is}} divided, however, {{as to the}} virtues of the color version {{compared}} to the original black and white art. Wivel, for example, has referred to the 1987 American edition as [...] "garishly colored" [...] whereas Witzke feels [...] "the colors can’t be undersold [...] [...] [...] they are transformative to the work, and all you need <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>look</b> at the sun setting over two pages, which is so good it's kind of an insult to call it stunning." [...] Among Moebius admirers {{there seems to be no}} consensus on this matter, and some readers like both versions.

5000|$|The show {{began as}} three-minute filler between {{a pair of}} Minnesota KATE station programs, then {{expanded}} to 15 minutes, and finally became a half-hour show during its last years on radio. Like Easy Aces, the humor on Ethel and Albert was low key; like Vic and Sade, it was constructed around such simple, often mundane household situations as efforts to open a pickle jar. Often Ethel or Albert would attempt to prove the other wrong over some inconsequential matter. For example, one entire script centered on Ethel disputing Albert's claim {{that he could see}} her using only his peripheral vision. [...] "I realized that I didn't have to sit down and knock myself out every minute to try to think of something funny," [...] Lynch told critic Leonard Maltin years later.

What you really want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> at the whole data set in ways that tell you things and answer questions that you are not asking.
