40|$|In this {{research}} paper a Constant Market Share (CMS) approach {{was employed to}} learn export performance dynamics of Indian seafood (shrimps and cephalopods) in the major export destinations (EU, USA and select Asian countries), which accounts for a sizeable market for Indian seafood. The Constant Market Share model was used to disintegrate the growth in exports of seafood into market size effect, market composition effect and competitiveness effect. The analysis was performed for the seafood exports for a span of 12 years from the year 1996 to the year 2007, the period during which India had to face severe challenges from evolving food safety regulations in the EU and USA. The analysis was extended {{to account for the}} competitiveness at dis-aggregated commodity level. In the present study we observed enhanced competitiveness in the case of cephalopods while shrimp exports were less competitive. To a certain extent it shows that trade facilitating as well as <b>trade</b> <b>restricting</b> <b>effects</b> can coexist as an impact of strict food safety regulations. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the era of}} globalization, are borders just {{arbitrary}} {{lines on}} the map?Our results show that border barriers are large and inhibit much trade. 1 In this paper we show that further economic integration can very substantially increase world trade and welfare. We demonstrate this point with several applications. National borders mark differences in institutions, policies, and regulations that have economic significance. The significance of these policies becomes immediately clear when comparing countries to regions within countries that are not separated by national borders. Regions within countries are clearly more integrated. They have more synchronized business cycles, they engage in more extensive risk sharing, they trade more with each other, their growth rates converge faster, and their inflation rates are more similar. 2 This paper {{is concerned with the}} barriers to the free flow of goods implied by the policies, institutions, and regulations that separate nations. Some poli-cies are specifically aimed at erecting such barriers. All other <b>trade</b> <b>restricting</b> <b>effects</b> of national borders ultimately can be understood to reflect “policy,” with the proviso that much institutional trade friction is not easily changed. We will discuss estimates of the size of these border barriers, as well as their impact on trade levels and on welfare. Our welfare analysis takes the extreme position of treating all border barriers as trade costs without any correspon-ding benefits. A complete analysis would, of course, take account of the ben-efits associated with some border barriers—differences in national language...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{preamble}} of the Agreement {{establishing the}} WTO, {{the so called}} Marrakesh Agreement, points out the general significance of environmental protection and sustainable development. The WTO law contains several provisions concerning the environment. However, {{it is not yet}} finally clarified in how far WTO Members can adopt measures to protect the environment where those measures have <b>trade</b> <b>restricting</b> <b>effects.</b> This question is particularly problematic where a Member implements such a measure unilaterally and the measure affects other countries’ policies. The question at stake is to what extent Member States can unilaterally adopt measures to protect the environment where those measures have extraterritorial effect, i. e. where those measures require other states to change their policies in order {{to gain access to the}} importing country’s market. The GATT/WTO adjudicating body had to deal with two disputes addressing this issue, namely the Tuna-Dolphin dispute 5 and the Shrimp-Turtle case. These two disputes are of outstanding importance for the issue of unilateral measures with extraterritorial effect to protect the environment. Both disputes dealt with the question whether import embargoes, that were inconsistent with Article XI of the GATT for they imposed quantitative import restrictions, could be justified under Article XX (g) of the GATT as measures to conserve exhaustible natural resources. The two decisions interpreted Article XX of the GATT, particularly paragraph g of that provision, differently. The question whether countries can unilaterally adopt measures to protect the environment where those measures have extraterritorial effect must be analysed against the backdrop of both WTO jurisprudence and general principles of international law...|$|E
40|$|Intellectual {{property}} protection (IPP) attained its importance {{in recent years}} because of the steady increase of intellectual property-endowed goods and technology in global trade. Technology producers, among them multilateral pharmaceutical companies (MPCs) felt that the Paris Convention (the Convention) was not adequate in dealing with trade related issues, and that an agreement was needed to integrate the subject of IPP; especially patent protection for pharmaceuticals, into the broader context of global trade law. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement) concluded in the Uruguay Round in 1994 brought IPP into the global trading system. The patent system contained in the Agreement reflects {{to a large extent}} MPCs' proposal for a strengthened patent system which paves the way to ensure market access and equal competition opportunity in their endeavour to expand global operation. The objective of the global trading system is to liberalise trade, achieved by securing commitments of market access and equal competition opportunity through the application of the principles of most-favoured-nation treatment, national treatment and reciprocity, reinforced by domestic competition policy to ensure efficient functioning of markets. However, in regard to patent protection for pharmaceuticals, the exercise of the exclusive marketing rights conferred by patent protection has <b>trade</b> <b>restricting</b> <b>effect</b> because competition is excluded during the patent term. This <b>trade</b> <b>restricting</b> <b>effect</b> does not compliment the objective of the global trading system nor promote competition. But the TRIPS Agreement does not cover a negotiated result on securing the recognition in domestic competition policy of the exclusive marketing rights conferred by patent protection, especially when domestic competition policy is designed to compliment microeconomic policy such as health care cost control. The implementation of international exhaustion to allow parallel importation of patented products during the term of patent is an example in point. It is an issue the TRIPS Agreement does not address and is excluded from the World Trade Organisation (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism. It is a legal issue because the disparity among national competition policy will cause trade distortions. It is political because the issue touches upon nations' regulatory autonomy in designing their competition policy to compliment other government policies. It also has economic implications in that countries might wish to rely on parallel importation as a mechanism to bring down prices of patent products. A complex issue as such requires- a multilateral solution enshrined in a legally binding agreement. In the absence of such an agreement, patent system under the TRIPS Agreement will be inadequate and ineffective because it will become inoperable and nations will incline to retrieve to unilateral actions for the resolution of grievances...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{estimates of}} the trade impacts of U. S. antidumping law and the determinants of suit filing activity from 1980 - 1985. We study three possible channels through which the threat or mere possibility of antidumping duties can <b>restrict</b> <b>trade</b> which we believe, when combined with the direct effects of duties, capture most of the trade effects of antidumping law. We refer to these three non- duty effects as the investigation effect, the suspension effect, and the withdrawal effect. Investigation effects occur when an antidumping investigation takes place; suspension effects occur under so-called 'suspension agreements'; and withdrawal effects occur after a petition is simply withdrawn without a final determination. We find substantial trade restrictions associated with the first two effects, {{but not with the}} third. Finally, we find evidence suggesting that some firms initiate antidumping procedures for the <b>trade</b> <b>restricting</b> investigation <b>effects</b> alone. ...|$|R
40|$|European Union (EU) is {{the major}} trading partner for Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. The trade {{relationship}} between the two regions has been based on the non-reciprocal trade preference granted by EU through series of Lome conventions. However the non-reciprocal preference did not conform to the WTO article which necessitated a new negotiation called Economic Partnership Agreement based on reciprocity. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the economic implications of EPA and the alternative general preference scheme considering tariff preference offsetting impact of rules of Origin. The result show that EPA increase imports and exports disproportionately deteriorating of balance of trade for all ACP regions. Imports from EU increase by the range of 12 % in Pacific to 52 % in Central Africa and the corresponding revenue loss lie between 2. 3 % and 48 %. As result of the increased completion from import, industrial value added decrease from 4. 5 % in SADC to 12. 2 % Central Africa. However, deep intra- regional integration helps to buffer the deindustrialization effect. Under the alternative scenario, imports decreases more than exports leading to trade surplus. The <b>trade</b> <b>restricting</b> <b>effect</b> of the rules of origin, which is measured by the reduction of ACP export to EU, ranges from 5 % to 11 %. Overall the results suggested that EPA tend to leave most ACP regions better off than the alternative option in terms of real GDP growth and welfare. Trade creation dominates trade diversion except for Central Africa, West Africa and the rest of non-ACP region under EPA. The sensitivity analysis indicate that the improvement of welfare is robust for EU, SADC and West Africa at 75 % level of confidence with EPA and the welfare deterioration tend to be robust under the alternative scenarios for most ACP groups...|$|R

40|$|Natural health {{products}} (NHP) {{have been}} experiencing strong growth in consumer demand, both domestically and in foreign markets. The nature of NHP {{and the small}} sector {{of the population that}} used them in the past, has allowed them to “slip between the cracks” of regulatory bodies. As NHPs have become mainstream and have been marketed and distributed through major agri-food supply chains, governments have had to become more active regulators. New Natural Health Product Regulations came into force in Canada on January 1, 2004 to regulate these product which had been generally regulated under the Food and Drug Act. Canada is not alone in its regulatory reform and other countries have begun to create new and often more rigorous regulations for NHP. It as often the case that domestic regulations have unintended and sometimes <b>trade</b> <b>restricting</b> side <b>effects.</b> The current restructuring and focus on regulations of NHP, and the potential importance of trade within this sector, suggests that {{a better understanding of the}} non-tariff barriers that may arise could be important for the development of the industry in Canada and elsewhere. Analysis of trade effects arising from standards and regulations is not an easy task. Non-tariff barriers to trade tend to have product-specific effects making it difficult to find general results. Using a review of current approaches to address technical barriers, an analytical framework has been selected and applied to case studies. The cases studies examined the welfare effects of regulations as they pertain to three products with different characteristics; flax omega- 3 supplement, elk velvet, and a probiotic supplement. The case studies identified a range of non-tariff barriers arising from international regulatory divergence. The results suggest that trade barriers are likely to arise in the NHP industry and that they will differ from product to product. As a result, there is unlikely to be a single policy prescription that will facilitate the removal of barriers to international market access. Suggestions are made as to how barriers could be eliminated or reduced through formal trade negotiations or less formal bilateral discussions...|$|R

40|$|Global textile {{and apparel}} {{industry}} has since the 1950 s {{been subjected to}} various forms of trade policy measures. Well noted among these are tariffs and non-tariff barriers (NTB) /policy indicators. Understanding the dynamics in such relevant policy indicators and the implications they yield for trade is a vital step toward informing relevant policy formulation and agribusiness investment decisions. With the textile and apparel industry being the primary grounds on which development in most Asian countries is founded, we {{for the first time}} in literature assess effects of various trade cost indicators on global textile and apparel imports from 37 Asian countries using a ‘cost-incorporated’ gravity model for the period 1988 – 2004. Estimates from this study affirm theory-based associations between trade, distance, cultural linkage, tariffs, and non-tariffs barriers. We however discovered quite interesting associations regarding effects of tariff increments and existence of NTB. Although both are primarily imposed/instilled to <b>restrict</b> <b>trade</b> flow, <b>effect</b> of tariff increments was consistently negative across all models, but that for NTB was consistently positive, although significant only in the case of apparel imports. Plausible reasons behind the implications for tariffs and NTB are elaborated on in this article.
