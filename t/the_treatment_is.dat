5|$|Most of {{the acute}} side effects {{associated}} with brachytherapy {{can be treated}} with medication or through dietary changes, and usually disappear over time (typically a matter of weeks), once <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> completed. The acute side effects of HDR brachytherapy are broadly similar to EBRT.|$|E
5|$|Derogatory {{treatment}} {{must also}} have occurred in circumstances where the author {{has the right to}} be protected from it. The right to object to such treatment does not exist simply to protect damage, mutilation or the author's reputation. For literary, dramatic or musical works, the author is protected from derogatory treatment if <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> published commercially, performed in public or communicated to the public; he is also protected when a film or sound recording including the derogatory treatment is publicly issued. If the work is an artistic one, the author can sue when the derogatory treatment is commercially published or publicly exhibited, or when someone publicly shows a film or sound recording of the treatment. For films, the author is protected when the derogatory treatment is shown or communicated to the public, or when copies of it are issued to the public.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> {{also called}} neuromuscular {{electrical}} stimulation (NMES), {{and some of}} the manufactures who produce the equipment use their own terms, for example, Slendertone calls it electronic muscle stimulation, or <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> called after the name of the manufacturer, such as Ultratone or Slim Master.|$|E
30|$|A {{hypothesis}} {{is a test}} whether there is any such difference between <b>the</b> <b>treatments</b> based on <b>the</b> F ratio. It will ask whether the F ratio for <b>the</b> <b>treatments</b> <b>is</b> unusually high by comparing the F ratio {{to a kind of}} a standard distribution called an F distribution. The p value for <b>the</b> <b>treatments</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> probability of getting such a high F ratio if all <b>the</b> <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> really identical.|$|R
50|$|The mixture {{was given}} every hour, day and night, for nearly 50 hours. The end of <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> marked by <b>the</b> {{abundance}} of stools and then castor oil {{was given to}} the patient as a further purgative. <b>The</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> also described as 'puke and purge'.|$|R

30|$|<b>The</b> {{theoretical}} <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> {{very useful}} when analyzing the MAMR process. However, applicable field situations of <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>are</b> limited [21]. Hence, a numerical {{integration of the}} LLG equation is necessary for analyzing MAMR processes under various field situations.|$|R
30|$|Appropriate {{controls}} for <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>were</b> prepared and treated simultaneously as the experiments.|$|R
25|$|The {{course of}} {{treatment}} is not completed until several weeks later, when the microfilariae are dealt with in a separate {{course of treatment}}. Once heartworm tests are negative, <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> considered a success.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, imports {{into the}} EC are {{possible}} {{from third countries}} if the irradiation facility had been inspected {{and approved by the}} EC and <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> legal within the EC or some Member state.|$|E
25|$|A {{treatment}} of supplements of retinoic acid {{which is a}} part of vitamin A can help replenish levels and help bring learning to normal, but after 39 weeks this is ineffective even if <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> daily because it will not bring the retinoid hypo-signalling back to normal.|$|E
50|$|As of 2016, {{the only}} site {{approved}} to manufacture <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> MolMed.|$|R
30|$|The {{framework}} was {{a retrospective}} chart review. The population included 137 participants. <b>The</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> 1 – 4 capsules per day. <b>The</b> duration of <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> 2 – 48  months. The study included three controls: baseline, no-treatment, and dose–response.|$|R
40|$|Respiratory {{diseases}} {{were quite}} {{common in the}} past. A treatment procedure for an acute respiratory disorder, most probably pneumonia, in a  72 -year-old man was presented based on archival source materials dating from 1801. <b>The</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> provided by a doctor, barber surgeon “nurse” and pharmacist, who were practicing in Koniecpol in 1801. The patient was given mucolytic, antitussive, cardiac, antipyretic and analgesic medications and appetite stimulants. From the medical {{point of view that}} prevailed at that time, <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> correct. <b>The</b> patient was also given medications recommended under the humoral theory, which was still being followed at that time. According to that theory, the human body was thought to contain four humours: blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. An imbalance of humours resulted in a disease. <b>The</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> designed to restore the proper humoral balance by techniques such as enemas, diuretics and bloodletting. From the present medical point of view, <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> incorrect. It caused anaemia and disturbances in water, electrolyte and acid-base homeostasis. <b>The</b> <b>treatment</b> resulted in <b>the</b> patient’s death. However, one can hardly blame doctor Tichi, as his <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> fully compliant with the scientific views prevailing at that time...|$|R
25|$|Experts in pain {{management}} attribute the under-distribution of morphine to an unwarranted {{fear of the}} drug's potential for addiction and abuse. While morphine is clearly addictive, Western doctors believe it is worthwhile to use the drug and then wean the patient off when <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> over.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{specific}} {{treatment for the}} canine distemper. As with measles, <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> symptomatic and supportive. The supportive care is geared towards treating fluid/electrolyte imbalances, neurological symptoms, and preventing any secondary bacterial infections. Examples include administering fluids, electrolyte solutions, analgesics, anticonvulsants, broad spectrum antibiotics, antipyretics, parenteral nutrition and nursing care.|$|E
25|$|Another type of {{psychiatric}} hospital is medium term, which provides care lasting several weeks. Most drugs used {{for psychiatric purposes}} take several weeks to take effect, and {{the main purpose of}} these hospitals is to monitor the patient for the first few weeks of therapy to ensure <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> effective.|$|E
30|$|To avoid cross infection, {{samples from}} <b>the</b> unchallenged <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} first. <b>The</b> challenged <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> collected after <b>the</b> unchallenged sample collection had been completed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Three {{possible}} stability {{measures are}} considered for fullerene cages: the Wiener index, a sphericity quotient, and molar fractions derived from quantum chemical calculations combined with partitions functions. <b>The</b> <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> studied as possible {{measures of the}} relative-stability order for the isolated-pentagon-rule (IPR) isomers of higher fullerenes. <b>The</b> <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> illustrated on <b>the</b> C 78, C 80, C 86, and C 88 IPR sets. <b>The</b> full computational <b>treatment</b> can <b>be</b> reduced to topological/geometrical evaluations only in some specific cases...|$|R
25|$|Effective {{blinding}} can {{be difficult}} to achieve where <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> notably effective (indeed, studies have been suspended in cases where the tested drug combinations were so effective that it was deemed unethical to continue withholding the findings from the control group, and the general population), or where <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> very distinctive in taste or has unusual side-effects that allow the researcher and/or the subject to guess which group they were assigned to. It is also difficult to use the double blind method to compare surgical and non-surgical interventions (although sham surgery, involving a simple incision, might be ethically permitted). A good clinical protocol will foresee these potential problems to ensure blinding is as effective as possible. It has also been argued that even in a double-blind experiment, general attitudes of the experimenter such as skepticism or enthusiasm towards the tested procedure can be subconsciously transferred to the test subjects.|$|E
25|$|High-frequency {{treatment}} uses low-current high-frequency alternating currents, delivered via a glass electrode. Because {{the high}} frequency current converts {{some of the}} oxygen in the air into ozone, the treatment has a germicidal action, and is also drying and warming. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> used to aid healing and also to help desquamation (the skin's natural exfoliation) and stimulate sweat and sebaceous glands.|$|E
25|$|Medical tourism {{most often}} is for {{surgeries}} (cosmetic or otherwise) or similar treatments, though people also travel for dental tourism or fertility tourism. People with rare conditions may travel to countries where <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> better understood. However, almost {{all types of}} health care are available, including psychiatry, alternative medicine, convalescent care, and even burial services.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> 1, 2, 3, or 4 {{capsules}} of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin per day. <b>The</b> {{duration of}} <b>treatment</b> ranged from 2 to 48  months. The mean duration of <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> 12  months.|$|R
25|$|Microcurrent {{treatments}} (MENS) {{have been}} around since the 1970s in medical applications and are distinguished by their use of micro-ampere currents (i.e. millionths of an amp) which are hardly perceptible, but mimic the body's own bio-electric currents. <b>The</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> designed to soften wrinkles and rejuvenate skin, including skin damaged by sunburn, acne, stretch marks, cellulite and scarring.|$|E
25|$|Radiofrequency {{ablation}} is a {{minimally invasive}} treatments for fibroids. In this technique the fibroid is shrunk by inserting a needle-like device into the fibroid through the abdomen and heating it with radio-frequency (RF) electrical energy to cause necrosis of cells. <b>The</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> a potential option {{for women who}} have fibroids, have completed child-bearing and want to avoid a hysterectomy.|$|E
25|$|Survival rate {{depends on}} how quickly CPV is diagnosed, {{the age of the}} dog and how {{aggressive}} <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>is.</b> Treatment usually involves extensive hospitalization, due to the severe dehydration and damage to the intestines and bone marrow. A CPV test should be given as early as possible if CPV is suspected in order to begin early treatment and increase survival rate if the disease is found.|$|E
50|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>{{treatment}}s</b> <b>is</b> using {{blue light}} with aminolevulinic acid for <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of actinic keratosis. This {{is not a}} U.S. FDA-approved treatment for acne vulgaris.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{purpose of}} <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> to prevent <b>the</b> {{progression}} of corneal damage and promote healing of the corneal epithelium. <b>The</b> <b>treatment</b> should always <b>be</b> personalized {{according to the}} severity of <b>the</b> disease.
