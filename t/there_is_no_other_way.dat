An example of necessity would be a defense against a raging dog (unless the dog was directly sent by the owner, which would be case of necessary defense). The necessity may be invoked only in case of imminent danger and only if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> of avoiding it (subsidiarity), such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling the police. Also, the consequence of the necessity must be less serious than the consequence of the endangering act (proportionality).|$|E
5|$|Bart gladly accepts Martin's offer, as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> {{he could}} win over Nelson. Homer, however, feels betrayed by Bart's choice to drive Martin's racer instead of the one he helped Bart to make. When Bart tries to {{apologize}} to Homer, he selfishly denounces both Bart and Martin, telling Bart {{to do whatever he}} wants. Marge steps in and tells Homer that she has defended him through a lot of things over the years, but his latest actions prove that he is a bad father. As Bart gets ready to race in the final match with Martin's newly tuned racer, Homer thinks to himself about how selfish he has been, realizing that Bart needs his support regardless of whose racer he is using, and he rushes off to the race. At the starting line, Homer wishes Bart good luck and tells him that no matter how the race ends he will still be proud of him. The race is tough as Nelson pulls every dirty trick in his arsenal, but eventually through his skill Bart finishes first and the team enjoys their victory.|$|E

2500|$|As {{head of the}} Free State {{government}} {{during the}} Civil War, he was ruthless in {{what he saw as}} defence of the state against his former republican comrades. Although he actually disagreed {{with the use of the}} death penalty in principle, in October 1922 he enacted a Public Safety Bill, which allowed for the execution of anyone who was captured bearing arms against the state or aiding armed attacks on state forces. He told the Dáil on 27 September 1922, [...] "although I have always objected to the death penalty, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> that I know of in which ordered conditions can be restored in this country, or any security obtained for our troops, or to give our troops any confidence in us as a government".

2500|$|The {{essential}} partiality of {{our view}} of things, their being given only in a certain perspective and at a certain moment in time does not diminish their reality, but on the contrary establishes it, as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> for things to be copresent with us and with other things than through such [...] "Abschattungen" [...] (sketches, faint outlines, adumbrations). The thing transcends our view, but is manifest precisely by presenting itself {{to a range of}} possible views. The object of perception is immanently tied to its background—to the nexus of meaningful relations among objects within the world. Because the object is inextricably within the world of meaningful relations, each object reflects the other (much in the style of Leibniz's monads).

2500|$|Mill {{argues that}} if people who are [...] "competently acquainted" [...] with two pleasures show a decided {{preference}} for one even if it be accompanied by more discontent and [...] "would not resign it for any quantity of the other", then it is legitimate to regard that pleasure as being superior in quality. Mill recognizes that these [...] "competent judges" [...] will not always agree, and states that, in cases of disagreement, {{the judgment of the}} majority is to be accepted as final. Mill also acknowledges that [...] "many who are capable of the higher pleasures, occasionally, under the influence of temptation, postpone them to the lower. But this is quite compatible with a full appreciation of the intrinsic superiority of the higher."

Knowing that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> to bring him back to the living, Hook wants Emma to go on without him and decides that it's time to say goodbye and vows not to let her be his unfinished business. Emma agrees not to put her emotional armor back up once they are separated. When Emma returns, she's on to Hades' and the Blind Witch's scheme to leave the outsiders in the Underworld, and she and Regina use their magic to free everyone, while Henry leaves behind the [...] "Once Upon a Time" [...] storybook with the details on the “unfinished business” of all the remaining Underworld residents. Finally, Gold places Robin's heart into Pan's, only for Pan to discover that Gold tricked his father: Gold had returned Robin's heart to Robin earlier, while Pan was distracted. Instead, he had replaced the heart with a wineskin filled with water from the River of Lost Souls, which was enchanted with a glamour spell to resemble Robin's heart. Gold tells a stunned Pan that he did this to keep him from getting the happy ending that a villain like him never deserved, as Pan dissolves into the River of Lost Souls. Then, Gold uses Pandora's Box to contain Belle safely, before leaving through the portal. Afterwards, all people, except for David and Emma, enter the portal. A heartbroken Emma explains to David that she needs to protect her loved ones. David understands and then takes Emma through the portal, just as it closes.|$|E

According to Geoffrey and the legend, Arthur's father was Uther Pendragon, the king of all Britain. He goes to war against Gorlois, the Duke of Cornwall, to capture Gorlois' wife Igraine, with whom Uther has fallen in love. Gorlois defends himself against Uther's armies at his fort of Dimilioc, but he sends Igraine to stay safely within Tintagel Castle which is his most secure refuge, according to the legend and the Historia Regum Britanniae. Uther besieges Dimilioc, telling his friend Ulfin how he loves Igraine, but Ulfin replies that {{it would be impossible to}} take Tintagel, for [...] "it is right by the sea, and surrounded by the sea on all sides; and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> into it, except that provided by a narrow rocky passage—and there, three armed warriors could forbid all entry, even if you took up your stand with the whole of Britain behind you." [...] Geoffrey of Monmouth's story goes on to explain how the wizard Merlin is summoned and magically changes Uther's appearance to that of Gorlois to help get them into Tintagel Castle, while also changing his own and Ulfin's appearances to those of two of Gorlois's companions. Disguised thus, they are able to enter Tintagel where Uther goes to Igraine, and [...] "in that night was the most famous of men, Arthur, conceived." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{conference to}} discuss the {{question}} of whatever to sign an alliance with Germany and Italy on 8 August 1939, Itagaki again demanded that Japan sign an alliance at once. The Prime Minister, Hiranuma came out against such an alliance, arguing that with the situation in Europe {{on the brink of}} war, that Japan should not dragged into a war with Britain at this moment. On 31 March 1939, Britain had [...] "guaranteed" [...] Poland's independence {{while at the same time}} Germany was threatening war with Poland if the Poles not permit the Free City of Danzig to rejoin Germany. Hiranuma argued that an alliance with Germany might drag Japan into an unwanted war with Britain and might lead to the Soviet Union joining the [...] "peace front", meaning that Japan would have to fight both the Soviets and the British while the war with China was still going on. Hiranuma was tactful enough not to remind Itagaki that the Imperial Army was currently losing the border war it was fighting with the Soviet Union. The Finance Minister Ishiwata Sōtarō advised against war with Britain on economic grounds while the Foreign Minister Arita stated that purpose of the confrontation was to force the British to stop backing China, not cause a new war. The principle fear was the British [...] "peace front" [...] that was meant to contain Germany in Europe would soon come into being, forcing Japan to fight an alliance of Britain, France, the Soviet Union and which might be joined by the United States. The Navy Minister, Admiral Yonai stated there was no possibility of victory if Japan had to fight an Anglo-French-Chinese-Soviet-American alliance. The conference concluded that no alliance should be signed with Germany and Italy at this time. Itagaki through his deputy Machijiri Kazumotō, the chief of the Military Affairs Bureau sent letters to the German ambassador General Eugen Ott and the Italian Ambassador Giacinto Auriti saying: [...] "The Army has made every effort to obtain a favorable decision on the pact at the Five Ministers Conference of August 8, but no progress has been made since Japan's proposal of June 5. The situation is so critical that the Army minister will not hesitate to resign as a final measure, which almost definitely will lead to the resignation of Ōshima and Shiratori. The resignations will at first cause a great setback to the pact, but will gradually strengthen the foundation in Japan for it. But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> [...] for me to assume responsibility except by resigning. It is planned to execute the foregoing decision by August 15". However, the German insistence that the proposed alliance be directed against Britain rather the Soviet Union led to Itagaki not resigning after all.|$|E
