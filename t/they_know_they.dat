5|$|Billy Talent II hit {{the shelves}} on June 27, 2006. It fared {{very well in}} Canada in its debut week, landing in at number 1 on the Canadian charts. It also enjoyed {{significant}} success in Germany, where it also debuted at number 1 in the album charts in its debut week, {{and was one of}} the top 10 selling albums in the country. As of June 15, 2007, the album has sold almost 700,000 units worldwide, 215,000 of them in Canada making it certified 2x Platinum, and 200,000 shipped units in Germany achieved it platinum status there. However, the success did not duplicate itself in the U.S. The band has expressed that <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are a new band there, and they are choosing to concentrate their attention on Canada, Europe, and other places overseas instead.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} be {{knowledgeable}} contributors, children {{must be aware of}} their surroundings and community's goals. Children's learning in Indigenous-heritage communities is mainly based upon observing and helping out others in their community. Through this type of participation within their community, they gain purpose and motivation for the activity that they are doing within their community and become active participants because <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are doing it for their community.|$|E
25|$|Martin Sieff, United Press International (December 25, 2001) — The great veteran actor Maury Chaykin {{was born}} to play Nero. And Timothy Hutton is equally perfect as his leg-man and always squabbling employee/amanuensis/Dr. Watson/Captain Hastings sidekick, Archie Goodwin. … Hutton, an Oscar winner, and Chaykin {{are at the heart}} of it all. They have done many prestigious things in their careers and no doubt will do many more. But it is clear <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> will never have more fun than doing this.|$|E
25|$|In {{a typical}} class action, a {{plaintiff}} sues a defendant or {{a number of}} defendants {{on behalf of a}} group, or class, of absent parties. This differs from a traditional lawsuit, where one party sues another party for redress of a wrong, and all of the parties are present in court. Although standards differ between states and countries, class actions are most common where the allegations involve {{a large number of people}} (usually 40 or more) who have been injured by the same defendant in the same way. Instead of each damaged person bringing his or her own lawsuit, the class action allows all the claims of all class members—whether <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> have been damaged or not—to be resolved in a single proceeding through the efforts of the representative plaintiff(s) and appointed class counsel.|$|E

25|$|We want {{every man}} and woman in these two {{counties}} to recall the dates of these murders and also to recall whether or not any person close to them was missing or out of pocket during those nights. Persons who have such information and have been withholding it when <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> should report it are leaving themselves open to possible charges of complicity in event the slayer is captured. Make no mistake {{about the fact that}} the slayer will be captured because we will not give up this hunt until he has been captured or killed. All information received will be treated confidentially. We urge you to come in and tell what you know. Don't be hesitant or fear that you are causing an innocent man embarrassment and trouble in as much all investigation will be confidential. This is no time to take any chance on information which might lead us to the slayer. This maniac must be captured. We believe that we are justified in going to any ends to halt this chain of murder. Bear in mind--this killer may strike at any one. He may strike at persons close to him. For that reason, we believe any person with information that may lead us to the murderer should act in the interest of self-preservation.|$|E

When they lie down on the bed, in the dark, Courtney discovers that she is lying on something, when Charlie turns on the light he finds Teddy lying dead on his bed with his pants around his knees, and lipstick on his [...] "Hoo Hoo". When Charlie tells Alan, <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> have an even bigger problem: telling their mother. After pulling Evelyn away from the piano, they tell her and she then cashes in their honeymoon tickets for a trip for one to Fiji before calling the police.|$|E
500|$|According to Lopez, {{the song}} is about missing someone terribly; [...] "someone who is missing someone so much and has done {{something}} so wrong to the person that <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> can't fix it. So they just hate themselves right in that moment, they can't stand , they regret everything that they did and they wish they could change things." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe noted the chorus of [...] "Me Haces Falta" [...] to be self-loathing, with the lines: [...] "Tú me haces falta/Sí, me arrepiento/Me odio/Estoy desesperada" [...] (English: [...] "I miss you/Yes, I repent/I hate myself/I'm desperate"). Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly praised the song's lyrics, but dismissed the song's production, stating {{that it does not}} live up the song's [...] "florid, romance-novel lyrics".|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{inspired}} by popular reality television shows, most notably Survivor. The [...] "Can I trust Jim..." [...] line was a direct reference to the show and was a [...] "last-second addition" [...] according to Daniels. In addition, Randall Einhorn, the camera man for the episode, was a camera man for Survivor. When the episode was being written, many of {{the cast and crew}} feared that it would bear too many stylistic resemblances to Curb Your Enthusiasm. Daniels later defended the show, saying that the show was different because of [...] "the fact that they are on TV and <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are being filmed. [...] on camera." [...] During the writing of the episode, Daniels made the writers spend actual time on the set, most notably in Michael's office. Mindy Kaling later noted that she [...] "hated it." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the winter}} of 1996–97 Popović visited Serbia {{for the first time}} since moving to New York City, taking in the months-long protests led by the five-party Zajedno {{coalition}} (that included his ex-wife Vesna Pešić's party, the Civic Alliance) over alleged election theft at the November 1996 municipal elections. In July 1997, amid Zajedno's breakup, Popović observed the anti-Milošević energy of a few months earlier slowly petering out, admonishing the opposition as well as the Serb nation in general for not being courageous enough to condemn the Serbs' leading role in the Bosnian War by stating: [...] "The people are sunk in their passivity because <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are guilty, they know the lies they took in – <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> triumphed when Sarajevo was bombed. As a nation they have lost all self-respect." [...] He also claimed that [...] "when Milošević tried to rule the Communist Party (SKJ), he destroyed it, then by creating the war, he destroyed Yugoslavia. Now he's trying to destroy what is left of Yugoslavia." ...|$|E

A comprehensive federal law ‘On export control’ took effect on 29 July 1999.

2500|$|The show's early {{reception}} {{was not as}} universally positive, as critics {{lamented the}} show's stark departure from the highbrow norms of the Golden Age of Television; original nighttime host Dennis James admitted that even his own housekeeper did not watch the show for that reason, but also defended the series, saying [...] "CBS, who never wanted game shows, just put three game shows on the air, so <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> had better join the fight or lose out, because game shows have a tremendous appeal.

2500|$|The Miranda warning (often {{shortened}} to [...] "Miranda", or [...] "Mirandizing" [...] a suspect) is {{the name}} of the formal warning that is required to be given by police in the United States to criminal suspects in police custody (or in a custodial situation) before they are interrogated, in accordance with the Miranda ruling. Its purpose is to ensure the accused are aware of, and reminded of, these rights under the U.S. Constitution, and that <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> can invoke them at any time during the interview. The circumstances triggering the Miranda safeguards, i.e., Miranda rights, are [...] "custody" [...] and [...] "interrogation". Custody means formal arrest or the deprivation of freedom to an extent associated with formal arrest. Interrogation means explicit questioning or actions that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.|$|E
