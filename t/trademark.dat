5|$|A {{concurrent}} use registration, in United States <b>trademark</b> law, {{is a federal}} <b>trademark</b> registration of the same <b>trademark</b> to two or more unrelated parties, with each party having a registration limited to a distinct geographic area. Such a registration is achieved by filing a {{concurrent use}} application (or by converting an existing application to a concurrent use application) and then prevailing in a concurrent use proceeding before the <b>Trademark</b> Trial and Appeal Board ("TTAB"), which is a judicial body within the United States Patent and <b>Trademark</b> Office ("USPTO"). A concurrent use application may be filed {{with respect to a}} <b>trademark</b> which is already registered or otherwise in use by another party, but may be allowed to go forward based on the assertion that the existing use can co-exist with the new registration without causing consumer confusion.|$|E
5|$|A <b>trademark</b> dispute {{involving}} {{the owners of}} the identically named Burger King in Mattoon, Illinois led to a federal lawsuit; the case's outcome helped define the scope of the Lanham act and <b>trademark</b> law in the United States. An existing <b>trademark</b> held by a shop of the same name in South Australia forced the company to change its name in Australia, while another state <b>trademark</b> in Texas forced the company to abandon its signature product, the Whopper, in several counties around San Antonio. The company was only able to enter northern Alberta, in Canada, in 1995, after it paid the founders of another chain named Burger King.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, {{with its}} first {{location}} in Skokie, Illinois, Burger King Corporation and its franchises began opening stores and by 1967 had over 20 locations {{spread throughout the}} state.

Hoots 403 F.2d 904 (7th Cir. 1968). The decision issued by United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois, and upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, stated that the BK federal <b>trademark,</b> applied for in 1961 and granted in 1963, took precedence over the Hootses' older, state trademark; The Court granted the Hootses exclusive rights to the Burger King <b>trademark</b> within a circular area defined with a 20-mile (32km) radius centered on their original location.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, sugar {{shortages}} during World War I hurt {{sales of}} Archibald Query's Marshmallow Creme, so Query sold his recipe in 1920 to two men from Swampscott, Massachusetts, H. Allen Durkee and Fred L. Mower, who began distributing the product through their company, Durkee-Mower Inc. The pair renamed the product Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff, and Durkee-Mower continues {{to sell the}} product under the name Marshmallow Fluff. The sandwich made with peanut butter and marshmallow fluff continued to be eaten, but was not called a Fluffernutter until 1960, when an advertising firm Durkee-Mower hired created the term as a more effective way to market the sandwich. Fluffernutter is a registered <b>trademark</b> of Durkee-Mower, although the company's U.S. <b>trademark</b> registrations for the term cover only ice cream and printed recipes. In 2006, Durkee-Mower sued Williams-Sonoma Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Williams-Sonoma infringed on its <b>trademark</b> by selling a marshmallow and peanut butter chocolate-covered candy under the Fluffernutter name.|$|E
