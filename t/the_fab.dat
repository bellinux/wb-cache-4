5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fab</b> Five is a 2011 ESPN Films {{documentary}} about the 1990s Michigan Wolverines men's basketball players known collectively as <b>the</b> <b>Fab</b> Five: Chris Webber, Jalen Rose, Juwan Howard, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson. It chronicles the recruitment, glory years, notorious time-out fiasco, cultural impact and the scandal that followed these players who are described as iconic figures in the media. The film originally aired on March 13, 2011 on a national broadcast on ESPN. On its original airing, the film drew 2.7 million viewers, setting a record as the highest-rated ESPN documentary ever.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPreviously we {{reported}} a broadly HIV- 1 neutralizing mini-antibody (Fab 3674) of modest potency that {{was derived from}} a human non-immune phage library by panning against the chimeric gp 41 -derived construct NCCG-gp 41. This construct presents the N-heptad repeat of the gp 41 ectodomain as a stable, helical, disulfide-linked trimer that extends in helical phase from the six-helix bundle of gp 41. In this paper, Fab 3674 was subjected to affinity maturation against the NCCG-gp 41 antigen by targeted diversification of the CDR-H 2 loop to generate a panel of Fabs with diverse neutralization activity. Three affinity-matured Fabs selected for further study, Fabs 8060, 8066 and 8068, showed significant increases in both potency and breadth of neutralization against HIV- 1 pseudotyped with envelopes of primary isolates from the standard subtype B and C HIV- 1 reference panels. <b>The</b> parental <b>Fab</b> 3674 is 10 – 20 -fold less potent in monovalent than bivalent format over the entire B and C panels of HIV- 1 pseudotypes. Of note is that the improved neutralization activity of <b>the</b> affinity-matured <b>Fabs</b> relative to <b>the</b> parental <b>Fab</b> 3674 was, on average, significantly greater for <b>the</b> <b>Fabs</b> in monovalent than bivalent format. This suggests that the increased avidity of <b>the</b> <b>Fabs</b> for <b>the</b> target antigen in bivalent format can be partially offset by kinetic and/or steric advantages afforded by <b>the</b> smaller monovalent <b>Fabs.</b> Indeed, <b>the</b> best affinity-matured <b>Fab</b> (8066) in monovalent format (∼ 50  kDa) was comparable in HIV- 1 neutralization potency to <b>the</b> parental <b>Fab</b> 3674 in bivalent format (∼ 120  kDa) across the subtype B and C reference panels...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA combinatorial, phage-display {{library of}} human Fab {{antibody}} fragments was generated from IgG heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) genes cloned from the lymphocytes of a vaccinia virus (VACV) -immune donor. To ascertain {{the complexity of}} the library, nucleotide sequences of the variable regions of the HC and LC genes were determined. Fourteen distinct HC and 18 distinct LC (7 κ and 11 λ) that formed a combinatorial library of 22 Fabs were identified. Immune-precipitation of radiolabeled VACV revealed that at least six different VACV proteins were recognized by the antibodies.

40|$|Data from cryo-electron {{microscopy}} and X-ray crystallography {{have been}} combined {{to study the}} interactions of foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype C (FMDV-C) with a strongly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) SD 6. The mAb SD 6 binds to the long flexible GH-loop of viral protein 1 (VP 1) which also binds to an integrin receptor. The structure of the virus-Fab complex was determined to 30 Å resolution using cryo-electron microscopy and image analysis. The known structure of FMDV-C, and of <b>the</b> SD 6 <b>Fab</b> co-crystallized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the GH-loop of VP 1, were fitted to the cryo-electron microscope density map. <b>The</b> SD 6 <b>Fab</b> is seen to project almost radially from the viral surface in an orientation which is only compatible with monovalent binding of the mAb.

5|$|In summary, <b>the</b> <b>Fab</b> {{region of}} the {{antibody}} determines antigen specificity while the Fc {{region of the}} antibody determines the antibody's class effect. Since only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of an antibody, the classes of heavy chain in antibodies determine their class effects. Possible classes of heavy chains in antibodies include alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu, and they define the antibody's isotypes IgA, G, D, E, and M, respectively. This infers different isotypes of antibodies have different class effects due to their different Fc regions binding and activating different types of receptors. Possible class effects of antibodies include: Opsonisation, agglutination, haemolysis, complement activation, mast cell degranulation, and neutralisation (though this class effect may be mediated by <b>the</b> <b>Fab</b> region rather than the Fc region). It also implies that Fab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc mediated effects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules (see below).|$|E
