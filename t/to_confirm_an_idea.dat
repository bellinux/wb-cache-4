40|$|One of {{evaluation}} studies examining web search tools is ranking algorithm area. Accepting {{the idea that}} different search tools do use different ranking algorithms, the present research aims <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> such <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> using <b>a</b> statistical approach. To do this, five metasearch engines (MSEs) namely Ez 2 find, Dogpile, MetaCrawler, Info and WebCrawler along with their four common underlying single search engines (SEs) – Google, Yahoo!, Msn (currently called Windows Live Search) and Ask – have been applied. To conduct the research five queries have been utilized. For comparing ranking algorithms of these web search tools, statistical tests "Kruskal-Wallis " and "Tukey HSD " were utilized. The findings indicate and confirm that different search tools on the web make use of different ranking algorithms. In other words, this research supports findings of previous studies...|$|R
40|$|Through the {{enhancement}} of transport, turbulence is expected {{to contribute to the}} fast reconnection. However the effects of turbulence are not so straightforward. In addition to {{the enhancement}} of transport, turbulence under some environment shows effects that suppress the transport. In the presence of turbulent cross helicity, such a dynamic balance between the transport enhancement and suppression occurs. As this result of dynamic balance, the region of effective enhanced magnetic diffusivity is confined to a narrow region, leading to the fast reconnection. In order <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> this <b>idea,</b> <b>a</b> self-consistent turbulence model for the magnetic reconnection is proposed. With the aid of numerical simulations where turbulence effects are incorporated in a consistent manner through the turbulence model, the dynamic balance in the turbulence magnetic reconnection is confirmed.

40|$|Denne rapporten handler om arbeidstageres erfaringer med suksessive endringsprosesser og nedbemanning i en hjørnesteinsvirksomhet. Data ble innhentet samtidig som effekten av en global finanskrise (2008) betunget nye endringer og nedbemanninger. Lokalt næringsliv rammes. Utvalget representerer tidligere og nåvarende ansatte som har erfaring med mer enn en omorganisering i hjørnesteinsvirksomheten, og representanter fra lokalsamfunnet. Forskningen har benyttet en eksistensiell fenomenologisk aksentuering og analysemetoder. Ingen predefinerte spørsmål er benyttet. Informantene fortalte fritt om sine erfaringer med suksessive endringsprosesser og nedbemanning. Eksistensiell fenomenologisk psykologi og Frankls Logoterapi er det faglige referansegrunnlaget i dette mastergradsprosjektet. Hensikten er å belyse arbeidstakernes arbeidsforhold, ikke å bekrefte eller falsifisere teorier. Resultater viser et samfunn i krise hvor mentale lidelser, psykosomatiske sykdommer og voldsom dod oker. This article {{addresses}} the impact upon employees of continual and complex structural rearrangements within a key company. Data collection {{occurred during the}} recent (2008) world economic crisis which demanded local businesses to face new structural rearrangements and downsizing. Former and present employees that have experienced more than one structural rearrangement within one specific plant constitute the sample. Using an existentially inspired phenomenological psychological method, I gave participant informants the initiative to describe {{on their own terms}} significant experiences and perception of evolving situations and what those experiences meant to them. Thus, the target is not <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>a</b> theoretical <b>idea</b> or model, or to falsify or verify some hypothesis, but information that the subject freely chooses to share. The phenomenological ‘wager’ of this research is that those who lived through and struggled with intense emotionality have the privileged perspective for telling about a work force in crisis and the coming to pass of each new crisis. </p...|$|R

They are undoubtedly open country forms, which attest the extension of such an environment across the whole of Asia around 35 ° N in Late Miocene times.
