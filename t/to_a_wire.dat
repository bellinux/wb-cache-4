5|$|After {{they started}} to break apart, further orders were placed for {{additional}} suits and all the suits used eventually fell apart during the four days they were used on set. In order to film one scene, McChesney wore the suit open-backed due to the damage. No optical effects were used in creating Armus. For the scene where Riker is pulled into the oil, a stuntman {{was used as a}} stand in for Jonathan Frakes. Where Riker's face emerges from the oil, it was actually a plaster cast of Frakes' face painted black. It was placed on the same grate used to lift McChesney, and filmed lifting out of the liquid. The twitching effect in Yar's death was due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> tied around Crosby's waist being pulled on.|$|E

25|$|In July 2014, Cumulus Media {{announced}} that it would end its partnership with ABC News Radio, and enter into a new partnership with CNN to syndicate national and international news content for its stations through Westwood One beginning in 2015, including access <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> service, and digital content for its station websites. This service is unbranded, allowing individual stations to integrate the content with their own news brands.|$|E

50|$|Adaptive Wireless Path Protocol (AWPP) is a Cisco's {{proprietary}} protocol for wireless mesh networks. It dynamicallydiscovers neighboring radios and calculates {{the quality of}} all possible paths <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wired</b> network. An optimal path is established through a mesh of wireless nodes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wired</b> gateway and these calculations are continuously updated, allowing paths to change and optimize as traffic patterns on wireless links change. Furthermore, a self-configuring and self-healing wireless mesh backhaul is created.|$|R

500|$|Unaware {{at first}} of Simpson's {{accusation}} {{for the murders}} of his wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, he grows fearful after Joe convinces him to walk around town with the song Dust in the Wind while thinking about the murders. Ultimately deciding to cash in the ticket, his friends suggest he spy on Simpson during the golf game {{and try to get}} him to confess to the murders. Hooking Peter <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire,</b> his cover is blown when the device shorts out. Simpson laments having lost a chance of escaping the accusation. Feeling guilty, Peter decides that Simpson is actually innocent, and decides to befriend him.|$|E
2500|$|Projecting images onto a shape was an {{idea that}} both {{directors}} decided on together in a meeting. Shiga had only four days to create the projections before the video shoot, so contracted the work to an artist he previous collaborated with called Masaya Yoshida, {{as well as an}} art creation company. The projections of the members' faces were taken from video chats with the band members before the video recording. The dodecahedron was an idea of Kitazawa's, as he considered {{it one of the most}} beautiful shapes, and felt that a beautiful shape would work well as a [...] metaphor for the human brain. The shape is made of scrim attached <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> frame, in order for both the members and the projections to be seen. Two projectors were used to display the images onto the dodecahedron. No trial run was done before the video's shooting, and instead Shiga modelled the set-up as a computer-aided design until he was satisfied with the arrangement.|$|E
2500|$|The captain's cockpit voice {{recorder}} channel showed two [...] "dropouts" [...] of background power harmonics in the second before the recording ended (with {{the separation of the}} nose). This might well be the signature of an arc on cockpit wiring adjacent to the FQIS wiring. The captain commented on the [...] "crazy" [...] readings of the number 4 engine fuel flow gauge about 21/2 minutes before the CVR recording ended. Finally, the Center Wing Tank fuel quantity gauge was recovered and indicated 640pounds instead of the 300pounds that had been loaded into that tank. Experiments showed that applying power <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> leading to the fuel quantity gauge can cause the digital display to change by several hundred pounds before the circuit breaker trips. Thus the gauge anomaly could have been caused by a short to the FQIS wiring. The NTSB concluded that the most likely source of sufficient voltage to cause ignition was a short from damaged wiring, or within electrical components of the FQIS. As not all components and wiring were recovered, {{it was not possible to}} pinpoint the source of the necessary voltage.|$|E
50|$|Access points usually {{connect the}} nodes of <b>a</b> {{wireless}} network <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wired</b> network as <b>a</b> bridge or a router. Both a bridge and a router use <b>a</b> routing table <b>to</b> forward packets.|$|R

50|$|The keyset cables were {{typically}} routed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wiring</b> closet or wiring panel where the Key Service Unit (KSU) was installed and were terminated on a 66 type punch block, typically a model 66M1-50. Each of these blocks could accept two 25-pair cables for termination.|$|R

5000|$|... 802.11 {{networks}} are either infrastructure networks or ad hoc networks. By default, people refer to infrastructure networks.

60|$|Five {{minutes later}} Gillow, {{shivering}} and reluctant, turned {{out into the}} frost. It was a bitter night, and his breath froze upon his mustache. The snow and froth of the river glimmered spectrally, and when they had left the camp some distance behind, there was light enough to see a black figure crawl up a ladder leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> rope stretched tight in mid-air above the torrent. A trolley hung beneath it by means of which men and material were hauled across the chasm.|$|E
60|$|To {{drive the}} boat ahead was {{exhausting}} labour in the burning sun, and {{by and by}} Kit relieved a man whose efforts got slack. His clothes had dried stiff, his hair was full of sand, and the salt had crystallised on his burned skin. At length they stopped abreast of the steamer's gangway and somebody threw a rope. Mossamedes rolled, lifting a long belt of rusty side out of the foam. Sometimes she was high above the boat, and sometimes she sank until the water splashed about the open iron doors. A man, seizing a boathook, stood ready to fend-off the launch; the others got canvas bands under the camels. Then a long derrick swung out and a band was hooked <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> rope.|$|E
60|$|Foster {{liked the}} open trail {{and went on}} with a light step, until {{as he crossed the}} {{watershed}} and the country sloped to the south, he came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> fence and saw the black mouth of a railway tunnel beneath. It was now about two o'clock, and feeling hungry, he sat down where a bank cut off the wind, and took out some food he had bought at Hawick. He did not know if he found the shining rails and row of telegraph posts that curved away down the hillside out of place, but somehow they made him feel foolishly unconventional. His boots and mackintosh were wet, he was lunching on sweet biscuits and gingerbread, and did not know where he would spend the night, although it would not be at a comfortable hotel. Until he saw the tunnel, he had felt at home in the wilds and might have done so yet, had he, for example, been driving a flock of sheep; but the railway was disturbing.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} networking, {{a wireless}} access point (WAP), or more generally just access point (AP), is a networking hardware device that allows <b>a</b> Wi-Fi device <b>to</b> connect <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wired</b> network. The AP usually connects <b>to</b> <b>a</b> router (via <b>a</b> <b>wired</b> network) as <b>a</b> standalone device, {{but it can also}} be an integral component of the router itself. An AP is differentiated from a hotspot, which is the physical location where Wi-Fi access <b>to</b> <b>a</b> WLAN is available.|$|R
