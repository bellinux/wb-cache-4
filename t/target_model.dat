25|$|The Colt Bisley was {{introduced}} in 1894 as a target pistol. The name Bisley came from the famous firing range in Bisley, England. The Colt Bisley can be distinguished by the longer grip, the wider hammer spur, and the wider trigger. The distinguishing feature of the Bisley <b>Target</b> <b>Model</b> is the topstrap, which is flat and fitted with a sliding rear sight, adjustable for windage only. The front sight is a removable blade, which fits into the slotted base attached to the barrel. The revolvers were supplied with different blades for elevation.|$|E

This [...] "decametric" [...] all-weather variant is complemented by a [...] "metric" [...] day/night fair weather version which adds infrared homing (IIR) guidance that matches the target area with a <b>target</b> <b>model</b> stored in its memory for a [...] CEP.|$|E
2500|$|The Redhawk was {{the first}} {{large-bore}} double-action revolver made by Ruger. It was designed by Harry Sefried, who previously worked for High Standard Manufacturing Company, where he designed the High Standard Sentinel revolver. [...] The grip profile of the Sentinel was used on the [...] "Six" [...] line of Ruger [...]357 double-action revolvers, which included the Ruger Security-Six and its variants, the Service-Six and Speed-Six. [...] These revolvers were produced from 1970 to 1988, and were unlike other double-action revolvers in that they used a one-piece frame, rather than a removable sideplate, which lent them superior strength. [...] The Redhawk, introduced in 1980, was a scaled-up and improved version of the Security-Six, the <b>target</b> <b>model,</b> with a square butt grip, adjustable sights, and 5.5- and 7.5-inch barrel lengths. [...] The Redhawk was available in blued or stainless steel, and was primarily used by handgun hunters. [...] The Redhawk, designed for long-term use with the heaviest [...]44 Magnum loads, included a new latch at the crane, to firmly lock the cylinder at front and rear, a feature last seen in the Smith & Wesson's triple lock design, discontinued in 1915.|$|E

The Air Force models had no special markings and most were sold as surplus through the Director of Civilian Marksmanship Program.

50|$|In {{data mining}} and {{association}} rule learning, lift {{is a measure}} of the performance of a <b>targeting</b> <b>model</b> (association rule) at predicting or classifying cases as having an enhanced response (with respect to the population as a whole), measured against a random choice <b>targeting</b> <b>model.</b> A <b>targeting</b> <b>model</b> is doing a good job if the response within the target is much better than the average for the population as a whole.

40|$|In this paper, we {{applied a}} dynamic <b>model</b> for {{manoeuvring}} <b>targets</b> in SIR particle filter algorithm for improving tracking accuracy of multiple manoeuvring targets. In our proposed approach, a color distribution model {{is used to}} detect changes of <b>target's</b> <b>model.</b> Our proposed approach controls deformation of <b>target's</b> <b>model.</b> If deformation of <b>target's</b> <b>model</b> is larger than a predetermined threshold, then the model will be updated. Global Nearest Neighbor (GNN) algorithm is used as data association algorithm. We named our proposed method as Deformation Detection Particle Filter (DDPF). DDPF approach is compared with basic SIR-PF algorithm on real airshow videos. Comparisons results show that, the basic SIR-PF algorithm {{is not able to}} track the manoeuvring targets when the rotation or scaling is occurred in target' s model. However, DDPF approach updates <b>target's</b> <b>model</b> when the rotation or scaling is occurred. Thus, the proposed approach is able to track the manoeuvring targets more efficiently and accurately. Comment: 13 pages, 7 Figures, 1 Tabl...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports on}} a {{teaching}} unit on model development and model transformation. One example model is first developed and considered {{as the source of}} various possible transformations. These transformations are explained implicitly afterwards by showing the different <b>target</b> <b>models</b> obtained by the transformations. The source <b>model</b> and the <b>target</b> <b>models</b> each emphasize a particular aspect, and an appropriate teaching method is chosen in order to communicate central ideas in a well-understandable way. The chosen teaching methods stress active student participation in the development of models and transformations. ...|$|R

50|$|Populating {{the model}} forces the analyst to collate the {{collected}} data, organize the data, and evaluate evidence for relevance and credibility. Finally, after the analyst examines {{each piece of}} data, the analyst must incorporate the information into the <b>target</b> <b>model.</b> As the body of information builds in the model, the analyst can more easily determine where there are inconsistencies in conclusions. This requires the analyst to carry out further research to support or deny a particular conclusion. Also, as the analyst populates the model, the <b>target</b> <b>model</b> shows where gaps exist in the model. These gaps also force the analyst to collect additional information to more completely describe the target.|$|E

40|$|Model {{transformation}} {{is used in}} a wide range of applications including program synthesis, refactoring, and reverse engineering. A model {{transformation is}} a mapping of a set of source models onto a set of <b>target</b> <b>models,</b> where the mapping defines correspondences between the elements in the source and <b>target</b> <b>models.</b> As mathematical objects, models, irrespective of the formalism they are described in, are graphs, hypergraphs, or relations, hence model transformation between models can be described in terms of graph rewriting (or hypergraph or relations rewriting). Graph rewriting provides a rigorous basis for specifying the transformation, where subgraphs are replaced with other subgraphs according to a set of graph rewrite rules that define the transformation. In this thesis, we present the design and implementation of a graph rewrite engine for model transformations called cgrk. The tool is based on a formal mathematical background that will be presented. cgrk facilitates a meta-level framework where the source and <b>target</b> <b>models</b> are instances of meta-models. The transformation process consists of loading the metamodels and source model into an object database, where models are treated as graphs. The actua...|$|R
