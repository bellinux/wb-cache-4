60|$|I {{remained}} thus in deep thought, sinking {{further and}} further into the tar-bucket. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> {{the bottom of it}} I realized that I was in love with Edith Croyden.|$|E
60|$|On the way I {{revolved}} in my {{mind all}} that had occurred within the past two hours, and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> Mr. Harrison's place I had the matter in such shape that I could tell a clear, straightforward story.|$|E
60|$|That very evening I {{went to see}} Irene. My {{brain was}} {{whirling}} even yet, and I hardly knew what I was doing; but the cool air revived me a little, and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the Lathams' I almost felt myself again.|$|E
60|$|Will {{you please}} draw a {{document}} covering these requirements {{and have it}} ready by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> New York (April 14th).|$|R
60|$|I {{shall be}} very glad indeed to see Mary and the {{children}} and hope they may be back by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> Copenhagen, about from the fifth to the tenth of July.|$|R
60|$|The ticket {{was soon}} in my possession, and then I asked the ticket seller {{a number of}} {{questions}} concerning the route and <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> would <b>reach</b> my destination.|$|R
60|$|It was {{evening before}} I left Camberwell, and quite dark by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> home. My companion's book and pipe lay by his chair, {{but he had}} disappeared. I looked about {{in the hope of}} seeing a note, but there was none.|$|E
60|$|By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> home, it was sundown. Goton had kindly {{saved me}} {{a portion of}} dinner, which indeed I needed. She called me into the little cabinet to partake of it, and there Madame Beck soon made her appearance, {{bringing}} me a glass of wine.|$|E
6000|$|This {{feeling of}} bitterness, of rebellion, of dissatisfaction with myself, wore {{gradually}} away, and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> Chicago I had resolved to climb high. [...] "I will carry mother and Jessie to comfort {{and to some}} small share, at least, {{in the world of}} art," [...] was my resolve. In this way I sought to palliate my selfish plan.|$|E
60|$|He rushed like {{a madman}} from the room, and I {{followed}} {{him as soon as}} I had sufficiently recovered my wits. But, by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> top of the stairs, he was out of sight.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Ludgate Circus,' was the answer. 'The {{only really}} {{satisfying}} moments of my life,' he said, 'have been {{passed in the}} neighbourhood of Ludgate Circus. I leave Piccadilly an unhealthy, unwholesome prig. At Charing Cross I begin to feel my blood stir in my veins. From Ludgate Circus to Cheapside I am a human thing with human feeling throbbing in my heart, and human thought throbbing in my brain--with fancies, sympathies, and hopes. At the Bank my mind becomes a blank. As I walk on, my senses grow coarse and blunted; and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> Whitechapel <b>I</b> am a poor little uncivilised cad. On the return journey {{it is the same}} thing reversed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Ponnonner," [...] {{it struck}} me that I was as wide awake as a man need be. I leaped out of bed in an ecstacy, overthrowing all in my way; dressed myself with a rapidity truly marvellous; and set off, {{at the top of my}} speed, for the doctor's.|$|R
6000|$|By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> {{my house}} and had filled my pipe and sat myself down in the {{dilapidated}} cane chair on the veranda, that natural reaction set in which so often follows rejoicing at the escape from a great danger. It was true that no one believed I had cheated them over that thrice-accursed gold mine, but how about other matters? ...|$|E
6000|$|By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> {{the outer}} {{door of the}} cottage, he was a dark blur in the white blur of the fog which had {{swallowed}} up the cove, and was rising round the house-walls from the grass. I heard him shouting, [...] "Marion!" [...] and a faint mellow answer, far out in the cove, [...] "Hello!" [...] and then-- ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{smiled again}} and resumed his story. [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the old gate I was dusty as a stage-coach, and this old {{corduroy}} suit {{made me look}} as much like a tramp as anybody. As I came onto the old man he was waterin' a span o' horses at the well. Everything looked about the same, only a little older--he was pretty gray and some thinner--and I calls out kind o' meek-like: ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the road}} below me were three figures,--a lady, a gentleman, {{and a little}} girl. As the latter turned towards the lady who {{addressed}} her, I recognized the unmistakable copper-colored tresses, trim figure, delicate complexion, and refined features of the friend of my youth! I seized my hat, but by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> road, they had disappeared.|$|R
60|$|But {{they noticed}} him first and {{immediately}} charged him, {{for one of}} them had been his guard, and they had both been sent to search for him, his escape having been discovered between <b>the</b> <b>time</b> he left <b>the</b> cave and <b>the</b> <b>time</b> when <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> it. Evidently they had wasted precious moments looking for him in other portions of the mesa.|$|R
60|$|Art, like law, is the {{perfection}} of reason, and whatever is unreasonable {{in the work of}} an artist is inartistic. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had <b>reached</b> these bold conclusions I was ready to deduce a principle from them, and to declare that in a true civilization such a thing as that Hamlet would be forbidden, as an offence against public morals, a violence to something precious and sacred.|$|R
60|$|He {{walked back}} by my side, talking {{all the way}} of Daphne's many adorable qualities. He {{exhausted}} the dictionary for laudatory adjectives. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> his door it was not HIS fault if I had not learned that the angelic hierarchy {{were not in the}} running with my pretty cousin for graces and virtues. I felt that Faith, Hope, and Charity ought to resign at once in favour of Miss Daphne Tepping, promoted.|$|E
60|$|By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the ridge, I had {{discovered}} that she had prophesied truly, for now an ominous change had come over nature. A dull grey vapour had overspread the entire western half of the heavens; down, beyond the forest, the sky looked black as ink, and behind this blackness the sun had vanished. It {{was too late to}} go back now; I had been too long absent from Rima, and could only hope to reach Nuflo's lodge, wet or dry, before night closed round me in the forest.|$|E
60|$|The more I {{thought about}} it the madder I got, so that by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the valley I was furious, {{and the result of}} it was that I turned right around and went up that cliff again as fast as I had come down. I saw that Dian had left the ledge and gone within the cave, but I bolted right in after her. She was lying upon her face on the pile of grasses I had {{gathered}} for her bed. When she heard me enter she sprang to her feet like a tigress.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do not say}} I have no fear," [...] {{the doctor}} replied. [...] "I do my duty so far as I can, but I do not doubt that, sooner or later, I shall catch the malady, as {{many of us have}} done already. I take such {{precautions}} as I can, but the distemper seems to baffle all precautions. My only grief is that our skill avails so little. So far we have found nothing that seems to be of any real use. Perhaps if we could attack it in the earlier stages we might be more successful. The strange nature of the disease, {{and the way in which}} it does its work well-nigh to the end, before the patient is himself aware of it, puts it out of our power to combat it. In many cases I am not sent for until the patient is at the point of death, and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> his door <b>I</b> am met with the news that he is dead. But I must be going." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1974, Kagawa {{released}} the album Out of Mind through the Bellwood Records label (:ja:ベルウッド・レコード). In 1975, {{he appeared in}} the musical Juugatsu ha tasogare no kuni October, Land of Twilight, produced by musical theatre troupe Tokyo Kid Brothers, composing the music for the production and serving as its sound producer. The same year, he would participate in the recording of Nakagawa Isato's omnibus live album Hanauta to otsuki-san Hummed Tunes and Mister Moon with fellow artists Ito Takao, Otsuka Masaji, Kanamori Kosuke, Shiba, Nishioka Kyozo and Osada 'Taco' Kazuyoshi in Kobe. Kagawa would follow these projects with the albums Minami-yuki no haiuei Southbound Highway, which he recorded in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1976, and Komazawa atari de Somewhere Around Komazawa, which he recorded with rock band Lazy Hip in 1978. In the 1990s, Kagawa {{would go on to}} record more albums, including One (1991) and 2 (1993). Over a four-decade career, Kagawa's eclectic musical style incorporated elements of folk, rock, and pop; {{in an interview with the}} Asahi Newspaper in 2001, the artist expressed a hope that he [...] "might find my own music by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> 120 years of age or so." ...|$|R
60|$|Turning my thoat, I {{urged him}} after her, hoping {{to reach her}} side and bear her on again in our hopeless flight. Carthoris must have glanced behind him at about <b>the</b> same <b>time</b> and taken in the situation, for by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had <b>reached</b> Thuvia's side he was there also, and, {{springing}} from his mount, he threw her upon its back and, turning the animal's head toward the hills, gave the beast a sharp crack across the rump {{with the flat of}} his sword. Then he attempted to do the same with mine.|$|R
60|$|As soon as my duties at St. Nathaniel's {{permitted}} me, on {{the evening}} of the discovery, I rushed round to Mrs. Mallet's, Le Geyt's sister. I had been detained at the hospital for some hours, however, watching a critical case; and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> Great Stanhope Street I found Hilda Wade, in her nurse's dress, there before me. Sebastian, it seemed, had given her leave out for the evening. She was a supernumerary nurse, attached to his own observation-cots as special attendant for scientific purposes, and she could generally get an hour or so whenever she required it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{fear that}} I shall {{never be a}} true knight," [...] Edgar said, with a smile. [...] "I have heard tales of knights {{carrying}} damsels across their shoulder and outstripping the pursuit of caitiffs, from whom she had escaped. I indeed had believed them, but assuredly either those tales are false or I have but a small share {{of the strength of}} which I believed myself to be possessed; for, in truth, my arm and shoulder ached by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the hostelry more than it has ever done after an hour's practice with the mace." ...|$|E
60|$|I was choking and suffocating by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> Wolf Larsen’s bunk. I {{reached my}} hand and felt for his. He was lying motionless, but moved {{slightly}} {{at the touch of}} my hand. I felt over and under his blankets. There was no warmth, no sign of fire. Yet that smoke which blinded me and made me cough and gasp must have a source. I lost my head temporarily and dashed frantically about the steerage. A collision with the table partially knocked the wind from my body and brought me to myself. I reasoned that a helpless man could start a fire only near to where he lay.|$|E
60|$|So {{he draws}} {{a picture of}} the High street as it might have been. The lover of quaint {{architecture}} travels {{out of his way to}} see it, and when he finds it and contrasts it with the picture postcard he gets mad. I bought a postcard myself once representing the market place of a certain French town. It seemed to me, looking at the postcard, that I hadn't really seen France--not yet. I travelled nearly a hundred miles to see that market place. I was careful to arrive on market day and to get there at <b>the</b> right <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> market square and looked at it. Then I asked a gendarme where it was.|$|R
60|$|I {{was brought}} up to the Bar. After my first year's study of the law, I wearied of it, and strayed aside idly into the {{brighter}} and more attractive paths of literature. My occasional occupation with my pen was varied by long traveling excursions {{in all parts of}} the Continent; year by year my circle of gay friends and acquaintances increased, and I bade fair to sink into the condition of a wandering desultory man, without a fixed purpose in life of any sort, when I was saved by what has saved many another in my situation--an attachment to a good and a sensible woman. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> age of thirty-five, I had done what neither of my brothers had done before me--I had married.|$|R
60|$|That one victory cheered me. So far, our route {{had lain}} along the well-made but dusty high {{road in the}} {{steaming}} valley; at Nieder-Josbach, two miles on, we quitted the road abruptly, by the course marked out for us, and turned up a mountain path, only wide enough for two cycles abreast--a path that clambered towards the higher slopes of the Taunus. That was arranged on purpose--for this was no fair-weather show, but a practical trial for military bicycles, under the conditions they might meet with in actual warfare. It was rugged riding: black walls of pine rose steep on either hand; the ground was uncertain. Our path mounted sharply from the first; the steeper the better. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had <b>reached</b> Ober-Josbach, nestling high among larch-woods, I had distanced {{all but two of}} my opponents. It was cooler now, too. As I passed the hamlet my cry altered.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I couldn't {{be mistaken}} {{in her face}} and its look of {{mischief}} and triumph. She had been committing some act of sacrifice. I went to the family stockbroker. She had sold out two thousand pounds that morning and given them to Pump. Quarrelling was useless--Pump had the money; he was off to Dublin by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> his mother's, and Polly radiant still. He {{was going to make}} his fortune; he was going to embark the money in the Bog of Allen--I don't know what. The fact is, he was going to pay his losses upon the last Manchester steeple-chase, and I leave you to imagine how much principal or interest poor Polly ever saw back again.|$|E
60|$|I galloped {{away from}} Glenby in a rage. What a blessing Sara had not married {{me in my}} absurd youth! She would have driven me wild with her sighs and her obtuseness and her {{everlasting}} pink-and-whiteness. But there--there--there--gently! She was a sweet, good-hearted little woman; she had made Jack happy; and she had contrived, heaven only knew how, to bring a rare creature like Betty into the world. For that, much might be forgiven her. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> The Maples and had flung myself down in an old, kinky, comfortable chair in my library I had forgiven her and was even paying her the compliment of thinking seriously over what she had said.|$|E
60|$|There {{might have}} been an {{interval}} of half a minute between <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the windlass, and that in which I saw a tremendous white foaming sea rolling down upon the vessel. At this ominous sight, I instinctively seized the bitts for protection. I can remember the rushing of the water down upon me, and have some faint impressions of passing through a mass of rigging, but this is all. When I came to my senses, it was in an Irish mud-cabin, with an old woman and her daughter taking care of me. My head was bandaged, and most of the hair had been cut off in front I was stiff and sore all over me. Fortunately, none of my bones were broken.|$|E
60|$|And by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had <b>reached</b> America <b>I</b> {{had already}} {{come to see}} that just as the issues of party {{politics}} at home and international politics abroad are mere superficialities above the greater struggle of an energetic minority to organize and exploit the labor of the masses of mankind, so that struggle also is only a huge incident in the still more than half unconscious impulse to replace the ancient way of human living by a more highly organized world-wide social order, by a world civilization embodying itself in a World State. And I saw now how that impulse could neither cease nor could it {{on the other hand}} realize itself until it became conscious and deliberate and merciful, free from haste and tyranny, persuasive and sustained by a nearly universal sympathy and understanding. For until that arrives the creative forces must inevitably spend themselves very largely in blind alleys, futile rushes and destructive conflicts. Upon that our two minds were agreed.|$|R
60|$|Through it all I battled my way, hatless, soaked to the skin, yet {{finding a}} certain wild {{pleasure}} in the storm. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had <b>reached</b> my little dwelling I was exhausted. My hair and clothes were in wild disorder, my boots were like pulp upon my feet. My remaining strength was expended in closing the door. The fire was out, the place struck cold. I staggered towards the easy chair, but the floor seemed suddenly to heave beneath my feet. I was conscious {{of the fact that}} for two days I had had little to eat, and that my larder was empty. My limbs were giving way, a mist was before my eyes, and the roar of the sea seemed to be in my ears, even in my brain. My hands went out like a blind man's, and I suppose broke my fall. There was rest at least in the unconsciousness which came down like a black pall upon my senses.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘It is {{not that}} I was patient. I have begged to be released; but I knew too much, and I was still refused. I have fled; ay, and for <b>the</b> <b>time</b> successfully. <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> Paris. <b>I</b> found a lodging in the Rue St. Jacques, almost {{opposite}} the Val de Grâce. My room was mean and bare, but the sun looked into it towards evening; it commanded a peep of a green garden; a bird hung by a neighbour’s window and made the morning beautiful; and I, who was sick, might lie in bed and rest myself: I, who was in full revolt against the principles that I had served, was now no longer at the beck of the council, and was no longer charged with shameful and revolting tasks. Oh! what an interval of peace was that! I still dream, at <b>times,</b> that <b>I</b> can hear the note of my neighbour’s bird.|$|R
