5|$|According to Reuven Firestone, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> {{groups of}} Jews venerating Ezra {{to an extent}} greater than {{mainstream}} Judaism, which fits with the interpretation that the verse merely speaks {{of a small group}} of Jews. The book 2 Esdras, a non-canonical book attributed to Babylonian captivity, associates a near-divine or angelic status to Ezra. Mark Lidzbarski and Michael Lodahl have also hypothesized existence of an Arabian Jewish sect whose veneration of Ezra bordered on deification.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> {{scattered}} Brythonic {{settlements in}} the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans after the invasion of 43AD. This lasted only until around 61, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it, burning it to the ground. The next, heavily planned, incarnation of Londinium prospered, and it superseded Colchester as {{the capital of the}} Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000.|$|E

5|$|For most girls, {{childhood}} {{came to an}} {{end with}} the onset of puberty, which was followed shortly after by betrothal and marriage. Although marriage arranged by the family was the norm, romantic love was not unknown. Most women bore many children but few survived infancy, and grief for the loss of a loved one was an inalienable part of life. The main form of birth control was abstinence, and while <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> contraception it seems to have been mainly used by prostitutes.|$|E

5|$|Macroolithus is an oogenus (fossil-egg genus) of dinosaur egg {{belonging}} to the oofamily Elongatoolithidae. The type oospecies, M. rugustus, was originally described under the now-defunct oogenus name Oolithes. Three other oospecies are known: M. yaotunensis, M. mutabilis, and M. lashuyuanensis. They are relatively large, elongated eggs with a two-layered eggshell. Their nests consist of large, concentric rings of paired eggs. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> blue-green pigmentation in its shell, which may have helped camouflage the nests.|$|E

If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> any <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> structural break in volatility that can be linked to financial crises, the contagion hypothesis will be confirmed. Results suggest that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> in favor <b>of</b> the contagion hypothesis. ...|$|R

Titan, the largest moon, comprises more than 90% of the mass in orbit around Saturn, including the rings. Saturn's second-largest moon, Rhea, may have a tenuous ring system of its own, along with a tenuous atmosphere.|$|E
