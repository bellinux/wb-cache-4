5|$|Teaneck {{is governed}} within the Faulkner Act (formally {{known as the}} Optional Municipal Charter Law) under the Council-Manager form of {{government}} (Plan 12), implemented by direct petition as of July 1, 1988. Following its founding in 1895, Teaneck used the traditional township form of government, led by a three-member <b>Township</b> <b>Committee</b> (later expanded to five seats) elected on a partisan basis. On September 16, 1930, Teaneck residents voted to establish a nonpartisan Council-Manager form of government {{under the terms of}} the 1923 Municipal Manager Law, with five members elected concurrently on an at-large basis. In 1962, the Council expanded to its current size of seven members and the position of Deputy Mayor was created. In 1987, a referendum to alter the form to a Faulkner Act Council-Manager form of government was approved, providing for staggered terms for the Council. With this change, Council elections now take place in even years on the second Tuesday in May. The Council's seven members are elected at-large in nonpartisan elections to serve staggered, four-year terms of office. The four seats elected in 2010 will expire in 2014 and the seats of the three who took office in 2012 will expire in 2016, etc.|$|E
