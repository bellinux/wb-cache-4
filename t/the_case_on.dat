5|$|In the High Court case of Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989), the {{plaintiff}} {{argued that the}} 1989 amendments to the Constitution had violated the basic features of the Constitution by breaching the principle of separation of powers by usurping judicial power, and contravening the rule of law. The Court rejected {{the application of the}} basic features doctrine owing to the differences in the making of the Singapore Constitution and the Indian Constitution, {{and the fact that the}} framers of the Singapore Constitution had not expressly provided for limitations to be placed on Parliament's power of amendment. The Court also held that, in any case, there had been no violation of the Constitution's basic features on the facts of <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> <b>On</b> appeal, the Court of Appeal determined <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>on</b> other grounds, and thus found it unnecessary to decide conclusively if the basic features doctrine applies in Singapore.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, in Fong Thin Choo, the High Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} under regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979, the fact that goods had not been exported from Singapore was a precedent fact to the customs officer's power to require {{the owner of the}} goods to pay customs duty. Therefore, the Court had to decide whether the customs officer's decision was justified by the evidence, and not merely whether there was some evidence on which he could reasonably have reached his decision.

5|$|Judge Kevin McNulty heard <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>on</b> remand. After {{considering}} the parties' motions for summary judgment again, he ruled in the city's favor in 2014.

Judge McNulty also ruled that Heffernan could not prevail on claims that his perceived speech was protected, per Ambrose v. Robinson Township, a previous case on that issue in the Third Circuit, or that his actions were protected since they aided and abetted speech. Judge McNulty also rejected similar claims for freedom of association. He decided that Dye v. Office of the Racing Commission, {{a case in which}} the Sixth Circuit had held that the First Amendment reached perceived political association, was not a precedent he could rely on since Dye itself explicitly rejected Ambrose, and as a district judge he could not reject circuit precedent.|$|E

5|$|Legislative chaos ensued as Taylor {{refused to}} {{acknowledge}} the Assembly's decision and vacate the governorship. The Republicans in the legislature obeyed Taylor's orders, while the Democrats ignored Taylor and followed the orders of their leadership. Finally, on February 21, 1900, Taylor and Beckham agreed to let the courts settle the matter. The case first went before the Louisville Circuit Court, which found in favor of Beckham. Republicans appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, {{at that time the}} court of last resort in the state. On April 6, 1900, the Court of Appeals upheld the ruling of the lower court. Taylor appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which declined to hear <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>on</b> May 21, 1900.
