Now if he takes care of everything, there would be no {{particular}} evil thing and no evil in general in the but the Dogmatists say that everything is full of evil; therefore god shall not be said to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything.</b> On the other hand, if he takes care of only some things, why does he take care of these and not of those? For either he wishes but is not able, or he is able but does not wish, or he neither wishes nor is able. If he both wished and was able, he would have taken care of everything; but, for the reasons stated above, he does not take care of everything; therefore, it is not the case that he both wishes and is able to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything.</b> But if he wishes and is not able, he is weaker than the cause on account of which he is not {{able to take care of}} the things of which he does not take care; but it is contrary to the concept of god that he should be weaker than anything. Again, if he is able to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> but does not wish to do so, he will be considered malevolent, and if he neither wishes nor is able, he is both malevolent and weak; but to say that about god is impious.

It sits {{on top of the}} CORBA notification service and hides nearly all CORBA from developers.

This is a many-to-many publishing model whereby multiple suppliers send events to multiple consumers on the same channel. Furthermore, these event suppliers and consumers can be coded in C++, Java, or Python on any platform supported by ACS. There are only two classes developers need to be concerned with: SimpleSupplier and Consumer. SimpleSupplier was designed so that ALMA events (defined as IDL structures) could be published in the simplest manner possible without exposing any CORBA to the developer. Essentially all that needs to be known is the channel’s name and the IDL structure being published. The API <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> else. With the Consumer class, the developer is responsible for providing the channel’s name as well as associating event types with functions that will handle them...|$|R
