40|$|In {{this paper}} we report {{the results of}} a γ-ray study of IceCube's {{extraterrestrial}} neutrino candidates detected as track-like events. Using 70 months of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations, a likelihood analysis of all 1 – 300 GeV photons within 5 ° of the track-like neutrino candidates’ origin <b>was</b> undertaken, <b>to</b> search for spatially coincident γ-ray emission. One of IceCube's HESE (High Energy Starting Event) track events <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> spatially <b>coincident</b> with a γ-ray bright active galactic nucleus (AGN), PKS 0723 - 008. We find however that the chance probability for Fermi-LAT detected AGN <b>to</b> <b>be</b> spatially <b>coincident</b> with a single HESE track-like event is high (∼ 37 [*]per[*]cent). We therefore find no evidence of γ-ray emission associated with the detection of IceCube's HESE track-like neutrino candidates. Upper limits were calculated in the energy range of 1 – 300 GeV, assuming a point source origin for the neutrino events considered. The implications for the non-detection of γ-ray emission from the source of the HESE track-like events are briefly discussed. The large time period analysed in our study did however reveal two new γ-ray point sources. With a flux of (1. 28 ± 0. 08) × 10 − 9 photons cm− 2 s− 1, in the 1 – 300 GeV energy range, and an associated TS value of 220. 6, one of these new point sources <b>is</b> positionally <b>coincident</b> with the AGN PKS 1346 - 112.
