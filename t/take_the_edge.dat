25|$|Fowler bowled his off spin well, {{with bad}} luck, often beating the batsman but failing to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> and then missing the wicket. Steel's length was not perfect, but he bowled his leg spin for his field {{and was not}} afraid to be hit. Lister-Kaye was perhaps {{the best of the}} bowlers, and Manners the best of the fielders, at cover-point. Lubbock let through 18 byes, mostly off the turning {{deliveries}} of Fowler. Fowler and Steel took four wickets apiece.|$|E
500|$|Studio A {{contains}} {{sets for}} the school's hallways, washrooms, cafeteria and classrooms. The hallways are stenciled with {{phrases such as}} [...] "the perfect human being is all human", which were found at the Etobicoke School for the Arts, {{one of the many}} schools that set designers used during their original research. The washroom set has graffiti on the walls to look authentic, and is used for the girls' and boys' room; urinals are installed and removed as needed. The set used for the cafeteria is [...] "purposefully bland to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off the rest of the school looking so beautiful." [...] It is also used as the studio's cafeteria where the cast and crew eat.|$|E
2500|$|Ryan Potter as Hiro Hamada, a 14-year-old {{robotics}} prodigy. Speaking of the character, co-director Don Hall said [...] "Hiro is transitioning from boy to man, it's a {{tough time}} for a kid and some teenagers develop that inevitable snarkiness and jaded attitude. Luckily Ryan is a very likeable kid. So {{no matter what he}} did, he was able to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off the character {{in a way that made}} him authentic, but appealing".|$|E

60|$|His {{serenity}} lessened the earl's anxieties, but bewildered him; and it <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off <b>the</b> malicious pleasure which Rotherby {{was beginning}} to experience.|$|R
2500|$|Mackintosh {{thereafter}} {{became a}} bitter disappointment to Hazlitt. Looking {{back at the}} elder man's change of political sentiments, Hazlitt observed that the lecturer struck a harsh note if he felt it were a triumph to have exulted {{in the end of}} all hope for the [...] "future improvement" [...] of the human race; rather it should have been a matter for [...] "lamentation". The two later again crossed paths, when Hazlitt, as a political reporter, attended Mackintosh's [...] "maiden speech" [...] in Parliament, in 1813, leading Hazlitt to think deeply about what constitutes an effective speech in a legislative body (Mackintosh's was presented as a counter-example in Hazlitt's 1820 essay on the subject). [...] By this time, Mackintosh's return to the liberal camp had begun to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off Hazlitt's bitterness, although he regretted that the nature of his talents kept Mackintosh from being an effective ally in Parliament.|$|E

60|$|Louis also crossed himself. His tears burst out. He {{bowed and}} <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of a blanket to his lips, kissing it reverently. Then he {{covered his face}} with his hand.|$|R
60|$|His voice, though sunk {{now almost}} to a whisper, was {{vibrating}} with passion. He half dropped on his knees, <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of her skirt between his fingers and raised it to his lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{much the}} better, Sterling--so much the better. You shall <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off the next affair, {{by way of}} giving you another chance. I rely on the Blenheim, and on her captain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{might be}} a sort of {{protection}} for me, if you remained in it,' said Mr Boffin; 'you might stand betwixt him and me, and <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off him. Don't {{you feel as if you}} could make a show of remaining in it, Venus, till I had time to turn myself round?' ...|$|E
60|$|The cuirassiers {{were too}} much {{in a hurry to}} get through the guichet, which was a defile, and too steady to cut me down in passing; and, first giving them a few minutes to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off the affair, if there was to be any fighting, I {{followed}} them to the quay.|$|E
50|$|The 1929 New Orleans {{streetcar}} {{strike was}} one of the last of its kind. The rise of private automobile ownership <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off its impact, as an article in the Chicago Tribune observed as early as 1915.|$|R
50|$|The major {{developer}} of Stoicism, Chrysippus, <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off strict necessity. Like Democritus, Aristotle, and Epicurus before him, {{he wanted to}} strengthen the argument for moral responsibility, in particular defending it from Aristotle's and Epicurus' indeterminate chance causes.|$|R
50|$|In 2000 he {{directed}} The Waiting List, which tells the humorous {{story of a}} group of passengers waiting for a bus that will never appear. The use of humor and realistic dialogue <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off of Tabío’s social commentary and illustration of the problems Cuba faces.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a goodly hostel {{near the}} west gate, which is famed for the stewing of spiced pullets," [...] remarked Sir Oliver. [...] "We might <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of our hunger off ere we seek the prince, for though his tables are gay with damask and silver {{he is no}} trencherman himself, and hath no sympathy {{for those who are}} his betters." ...|$|E
6000|$|To this announcement, very placidly made, Daisy's mamma {{offered no}} response. Winterbourne {{took for granted}} that she deeply disapproved of the {{projected}} excursion; but {{he said to himself}} that she was a simple, easily managed person, and that a few deferential protestations would <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> from her displeasure. [...] "Yes," [...] he began; [...] "your daughter has kindly allowed me the honor of being her guide." ...|$|E
60|$|Montgomery smiled. A {{pleasant}} {{sense of}} relief thrilled softly through him. What blessed safety-valve was this through which his jangled nerves might find some outlet. The provocation was so gross, the insult so unprovoked, {{that he could have}} none of those qualms which <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off a man's mettle. He finished sealing the bottle upon which he was occupied, and he addressed it and placed it carefully in the rack.|$|E
5000|$|The Guardian: [...] "Herreweghe's {{accounts}} are typically thoughtful, {{not at all}} theatrical or dramatically driven, and that slightly laid-back approach <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off <b>the</b> Magnificat too, though {{the quality of the}} solo and choral singing, and the careful shaping of the orchestral lines are all exemplary." ...|$|R
50|$|For {{short-range}} weapons, the Zande Warrior's makraka <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> over <b>the</b> Aztec Jaguar's tecpatl sacrificial knife. In the test, both {{weapons were}} demonstrated as execution weapons. First, the tecpatl demonstrated human sacrifice rituals when the victim's heart was removed; meanwhile, the makraka {{was used for}} beheading a bound prisoner. The makraka's precision while beheading the ballistics dummy gave it <b>the</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|R
25|$|Slips and bat pad require fast reactions, {{an ability}} to {{anticipate}} the trajectory of the ball {{as soon as it}} <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge,</b> and intense concentration. Most top slip fielders tend to be top-order batsmen, as these are both skills that require excellent hand–eye coordination. Wicket-keepers and Bat-pad tend to be amongst the shortest players of the team.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "no wonder they looked so thin; {{and no wonder}} they're beginnin' {{to be a little}} better in flesh now, wi' the legs o' mutton an' chops an' such like things that I get in to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off my appetite--which, as you justly observe, Miss Ruth, is not a bad one. I'm glad you've told me this, however, for I'll go in for extra heavy feedin' now." ...|$|E
60|$|The flies are {{incredibly}} numerous just now. The unsightly blot {{a little higher}} up was occasioned by a very fine one who fell into the inkstand, and came out, unexpectedly, on the nib of my pen. We are all quite well, thank Heaven, and had a very interesting journey here, of which, {{as well as of}} this place, I will not write a word, lest I should <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off those agreeable conversations with which we will beguile our walks.|$|E

The provocation was so gross, the insult so unprovoked, {{that he could have}} none of those qualms which <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off a man's mettle. He finished sealing the bottle upon which he was occupied, and he addressed it and placed it carefully in the rack. [...] "Look here!" [...] said he, turning round to the miner, [...] "your medicine will be made up in its turn and sent down to you. I don't allow folk in the surgery. Wait outside in the waiting-room if you wish to wait at all." ...|$|E

60|$|But I {{kept the}} book and read it as a neutral observer, {{and came to the}} {{conclusion}} that these South Sea Islands, a land where it was always afternoon, must be a charming place, in which perhaps the stars of the Tropics and the scent of the flowers might enable one to forget a little, or at least <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off memory. Why should I not visit them and escape another long and dreary English winter? No, I could not do so alone. If Bastin and Bickley were there, their eternal arguments might amuse me. Well, why should they not come also? When one has money things can always be arranged.|$|E
60|$|Supper was {{the family}} meal of the day--the one meal at which Johnny {{encountered}} his younger brothers and sisters. It partook {{of the nature of}} an encounter, to him, for he was very old, while they were distressingly young. He had no patience with their excessive and amazing juvenility. He did not understand it. His own childhood was too far behind him. He was like an old and irritable man, annoyed by the turbulence of their young spirits that was to him arrant silliness. He glowered silently over his food, finding compensation in the thought that they would soon have to go to work. That would <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off of them and make them sedate and dignified--like him. Thus it was, after the fashion of the human, that Johnny made of himself a yardstick with which to measure the universe.|$|E
60|$|But, {{truth to}} say, on this July day I {{reflected}} but {{little on the}} condition of the civilised world. Whatever sinister passions were heaving under its splendid and complex surface, I was too agitated by a simple and innocent desire of my own, to notice the signs or interpret them correctly. The most innocent of passions will <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off one's judgment. The desire which possessed me was simply the desire to travel. And that being so it would have taken something very plain in the way of symptoms to shake my simple trust in the stability of things on the Continent. My sentiment and not my reason was engaged there. My eyes were turned to the past, not to the future; the past that one cannot suspect and mistrust, the shadowy and unquestionable moral possession the darkest struggles of which wear a halo of glory and peace.|$|E
60|$|Captain Horton {{found his}} vis-a-vis a {{somewhat}} unsatisfactory companion. She drank several glasses of champagne, ate scarcely anything, and rushed him away {{before he had}} <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off his appetite. He {{brought her to the}} Duchess and went back in a huff to finish his supper alone. Lady Carey went downstairs and discovered Mr. Brott, who had scarcely moved.|$|R
6000|$|She {{accepted}} my assent; but, oddly enough, with {{a sudden}} qualification that showed her as still sharply disposed {{to make use of}} any loose scrap of her embarrassed acuteness. [...] "Of course, at the same time, you yourself saw that your not admitting the possibility would have <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> from your cruelty. It's not the innocent," [...] she suggestively remarked, [...] "that we fear to frighten." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, yes,' said Jonas, plying his own {{knife and}} fork very fast. 'He eats--when he's helped. But he don't care whether he waits a minute or an hour, as long as father's here; so when I'm at all sharp set, as I am to-day, I come to him after I've <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> off my own hunger, you know. Now, Chuffey, stupid, are you ready?' ...|$|R
