5|$|As is {{discussed}} below, <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> delay was probably simply {{that neither the}} Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially.

5|$|David Crowe {{writes that}} the SS had become an {{economic}} force {{in its own right}} by 1944, thanks to its plundering of Jewish businesses and ownership of factories that used slave labour from concentration camps.

5|$|In 1709, Abraham Darby I {{established}} a coke-fired blast furnace to produce cast iron, replacing charcoal, although continuing to use blast furnaces.
