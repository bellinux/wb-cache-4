50|$|Index {{arbitrage}} exploits index <b>tracker</b> <b>funds</b> {{which are}} bound {{to buy and sell}} large volumes of securities in proportion to their changing weights in indices. If a HFT firm is able to access and process information which predicts these changes before the <b>tracker</b> <b>funds</b> do so, they can buy up securities in advance of the trackers and sell them on to them at a profit.|$|R

50|$|Traders {{buying into}} stocks {{in advance of}} their joining an index and {{increasing}} weight will profit from the rise in demand for the stock when the change takes place. This effect {{is largely due to}} the popularity of index <b>tracker</b> <b>funds</b> which buy automatically on these events. The arbitrage opportunity is thus a zero-sum transfer of wealth from passive index investors to arbitrageurs. As index arbitrage becomes more common, and when reweightings occur more frequently, the loss to tracker investors increases. The presence of index arbitrageurs is an argument for active investment which is less vulnerable to this exploitation (but however incurs higher management fees) or for simple buy and hold strategies.|$|R

5000|$|The British {{approach}} to MRP design {{dates back to}} the early 1980s. The latest version of this approach, called [...] "RIIO" [...] (Revenue = Incentives + Innovation + Outputs), has been implemented for gas and power transmission utilities and will begin for power distributors in 2015. The heart of the RIIO system is an MRP, which the British call a [...] "price control". A revenue cap ARM has an RPI - X formula. The typical plan term is 8 years. Since the ARM is based on multiyear cost forecasts, the regulator must carefully review utility business plans. Statistical benchmarking and independent engineering studies loom large in cost appraisals. 30 months is typically required to process a RIIO application.

40|$|Fama-French (Carhart) alphas {{of passive}} indices should be zero, but recent {{evidence}} shows otherwise. Inaccuracies of {{factors in the}} performance measurement models have been put forward as {{the main reason for}} this. Some computationally intensive solutions to factor adjustment have been proposed, but are not applicable to all benchmark indices. We propose an optimisation algorithm that makes minor adjustments to the market, size, value and momentum factors to obtain zero alphas for any benchmark index. In the sample of 1281 active and 102 passive US equity mutual funds benchmarking against S&P 500, our adjustment leads to augmentation of fund performance upwards in periods of index underperformance and downwards in periods of index outperformance. Overall, the adjusted alphas of both groups of funds are significantly negative, signalling poor performance. This is particularly pronounced for <b>tracker</b> <b>funds,</b> whose managers have not been successful in enhancing returns adequately to make-up for the costs involved in any of the sub-periods examined...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the returns of {{emerging}} market stocks that {{are included in}} and excluded from the MSCI Emerging Markets index, a widely used benchmark for investment funds. Our sample consists of 269 stocks from 24 countries that {{were added to the}} index and 262 stocks that were deleted. We find convincing evidence of positive (negative) permanent (temporary) price impacts upon index inclusion (exclusion). We attribute this to the radar screen effect (Merton, 1987), which predicts that more visible stocks attract more (distant) investors and hence require lower expected returns. Consistent with this theory, in the long-run we find that betas with respect to the world index increase, while those of the local indices decrease. When we analyse returns over a short-run event window from before announcement to after inclusion, we find evidence of a pronounced short term drift which persists after the inclusion date. We attribute this short term phenomenon to limited arbitrage on the predictable portfolio rebalancing behavior of <b>tracker</b> <b>funds.</b> I...|$|R

Every morning, their tracker was told where they had spent the previous night. The public were encouraged to phone in information to the trackers, but natural sympathy with the runners made information somewhat sparse and in the second series a bribe of a £1,000 reward was added to encourage people to phone in. The runners themselves could, and did, arrange for their friends and family to send in false leads.|$|R

5000|$|Malcolm, though, {{discovered}} that the <b>tracker</b> <b>fund</b> {{was not going to}} buy the PCC stock through the exchanges at all.

Accordingly, on Malcolm's suggestion, Carney's hedge fund took a [...] "short" [...] position on $100 million of PCC stock.

40|$|Purpose – Tracker funds {{offer an}} {{attractive}} balance between risk and return, {{by providing the}} profit of the index, with the reduced risk associated with the broad market cover. An effectively designed <b>tracker</b> <b>fund</b> will achieve best tracking of the index with minimal running and trading costs. This paper aims to investigate the use of improved optimisation methods for the design and maintenance of tracker funds. Design/methodology/approach - Most current methods of <b>tracker</b> <b>fund</b> optimisation use quadratic programming (QP), due to its simple formulation and efficient solution. However, the explicit tracking of {{the return of the}} index and the optimal selection of the subset of shares composing the fund is not directly available using these methods. This paper investigates ways to overcome the shortcomings of current methods by using genetic algorithms (GA). A GA based <b>tracker</b> <b>fund</b> optimisation method is applied to Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 data using computer simulations. Findings - Tracking performance is presented and compared to QP. Results show the advantage of the new method for various conditions of <b>tracker</b> <b>fund</b> subset size and update rates. In particular, there is an improved performance when evaluating the errors in optimising returns of the index. Practical implications - The paper intentionally sets out to use commercially available software to implement the optimisation approaches, thus demonstrating that the advantages of using GAs are easily realisable and do not require tailor made software. Originality/value - The paper provides a direct comparison between the established approach of QP and a GA. The implementation uses commercially available software and is therefore easily realisable in practice. Fund management, Optimization techniques, Risk assessmen...|$|E
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis and following bond buyback actions and quantitative easing announcements by the ECB {{have led to}} strong demand for fixed income investments, particularly in Europe.

I propose new custom bond funds based on quantitative strategies using the bond constituents of Markit iBoxx index. I then compare the performance of these custom bond funds with the benchmark Markit EUR Corporate index, the passive <b>tracker</b> <b>fund</b> and the active bond funds.

Using the volatility measure proposed by Andersen et al.

The patterns of volatility change do not differ statistically among different size categories. However, the volatilities of the electronic and the financial sector TTT constituent companies increased significantly after the introduction of TTT, while the volatility of companies in the mixed sector reduced. ...|$|E
40|$|Macroeconomic or {{financial}} data are often modelled with cointegration and GARCH. Noticeable examples include those studies of price discovery, in which stock {{prices of the}} same underlying asset are cointegrated and they exhibit multivariate GARCH. Modifying the asymptotic theories developed in Li, Ling and Wong (2001) and Sin and Ling (2004), this paper proposes a WLS (weighted least squares) for the parameters of an ECM (error-correction model). Apart from its computational simplicity, by construction, the consistency of WLS is insensitive to possible misspecification in conditional variance. Further, asymmetrically distributed deflated error is allowed, {{at the expense of}} more involved asymptotic distributions of the statistics. Efficiency loss relative to QMLE (quasi-maximum likelihood estimator) is discussed within the class of LABF (locally asymptotically Brownian functional) models. The insensitivity and efficiency of WLS in finite samples are examined through Monte Carlo experiments.
