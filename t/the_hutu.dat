5|$|After 1945, a Hutu counter-elite developed, {{leading to}} a {{deterioration}} in relations between the groups. The Tutsi leadership agitated for speedy independence to cement their hold on power, while <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> elite called for the transfer of power from Tutsi to Hutu, a stance increasingly supported by {{the church and the}} colonial government. In November 1959, <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> began a series of riots and arson attacks on Tutsi homes, following false rumours of the death of a Hutu sub-chief by Tutsi activists. Violence quickly spread across the whole country, beginning the Rwandan Revolution. The king and Tutsi politicians attempted a fightback, seeking to seize power and ostracise <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> and Belgians. This plan was thwarted by Belgian colonel Guy Logiest, who was brought in by the colonial governor. Logiest re-established law and order, and began a programme of overt promotion and protection of <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> elite, replacing many Tutsi chiefs with Hutu, and forcing King Kigeli V into exile. Logiest and Hutu leader Grégoire Kayibanda declared the country an autonomous republic in 1961, and it became independent in 1962. More than 336,000 Tutsi left Rwanda to escape <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> purges, settling primarily in the four neighbouring countries of Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania and Zaire. The Tutsi exiles were regarded as refugees in their host countries, and sought a quick return to Rwanda. They formed armed groups and launched attacks on Rwanda, the largest of which advanced close to Kigali in 1963. These groups were known as the inyenzi (cockroaches). Historians do not know the origin of this term – it is possible the rebels coined it themselves, the name reflecting the fact that they generally attacked at night. The inyenzi label resurfaced in the 1990s, as a highly derogatory term used by Hutu hardliners to refer to all Tutsi, dehumanising them. The inyenzi attacks of the 1960s were poorly equipped and organised and the government defeated them, following up with the slaughter of an estimated 10,000 Tutsi within Rwanda.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Gitera {{visited the}} king at his palace in Nyanza. Although Gitera had {{considerable}} {{respect for the}} monarchy, Rudahigwa treated him contemptuously; {{at one point he}} grabbed Gitera's throat, calling him and his followers inyangarwanda (haters of Rwanda). This humiliation prompted the MSM, APROSOMA and the pro-Hutu Catholic publications to take a firmer stance against the monarchy. Kinyamateka published a detailed report of Rudahigwa's treatment of Gitera, refuting his semi-divine image and accusing him of pro-Tutsi racism. The magazine also published stories citing the origin myths of <b>the</b> <b>Hutu,</b> Tutsi and Twa, calling the king's policies inconsistent with them. The articles did not immediately challenge the king's authority over <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> peasants, but their exposure of Rudahigwa's outburst led to a permanent schism between him, <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> counter-elite and Belgian authorities. In 1958 the Belgian colonial ministry tried to strip Rudahigwa of his power, reducing him to a figurehead, but his popularity with the regional chiefs and the Tutsi (who feared the growing Hutu movement) sparked a series of strikes and protests.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} is young and predominantly rural, with a density {{among the highest}} in Africa. Rwandans are drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group, the Banyarwanda, although within this group there are three subgroups: <b>the</b> <b>Hutu,</b> Tutsi and Twa. The Twa are a forest-dwelling pygmy people descended from Rwanda's earliest inhabitants. Scholars disagree on the origins of and differences between <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> and Tutsi; some believe differences are derived from former social castes within a single people, while others believe <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> and Tutsi arrived in the country separately, and from different locations. Christianity is the largest religion in the country; the principal language is Kinyarwanda, spoken by most Rwandans, with English and French serving as official languages. Rwanda has a presidential system of government. The president is Paul Kagame of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), who took office in 2000. Rwanda today has low corruption compared with neighbouring countries, although human rights organisations report suppression of opposition groups, intimidation and restrictions on freedom of speech. The country has been governed by an ordered administrative hierarchy since pre-colonial times; there are five provinces delineated by borders drawn in 2006. Rwanda is one of only two countries with a female majority in the national parliament.|$|E

5|$|Belgium {{continued}} to rule Rwanda as a UN Trust Territory after World War II, with {{a mandate to}} oversee its eventual independence. The economic landscape had changed considerably during the war; a cash economy grew, {{and with it the}} demand for labourers in the Congolese mines of Katanga and the coffee and sugar plantations of Uganda. There was a simultaneous shift in the Catholic Church; prominent figures in the early Rwandan church, who were from a wealthy and conservative background (such as Léon-Paul Classe), were replaced by younger clergy of working-class origin. Of these, a greater proportion were Flemish rather than Walloon Belgians and sympathised with the plight of <b>the</b> <b>Hutu.</b> Economic conditions and the seminary education provided by the church gave <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> a social mobility not previously possible, allowing the development of an elite group of Hutu leaders and intellectuals. This group, consisting of Hutu from the precolonial Kingdom of Rwanda, was joined by prominent citizens of kingdoms acquired during colonialism (including the Kiga).|$|E
5|$|By late 1996, Hutu militants {{from the}} camps were {{launching}} regular cross-border incursions, and the RPF-led Rwandan government launched a counteroffensive. Rwanda provided troops and military training to the Banyamulenge, a Tutsi {{group in the}} Zairian South Kivu province, helping them to defeat Zairian security forces. Rwandan forces, the Banyamulenge, and other Zairian Tutsi, then attacked the refugee camps, targeting <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> militia. These attacks caused {{hundreds of thousands of}} refugees to flee; many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF, while others ventured further west into Zaire. The defeated forces of the former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign, supported initially by the predominantly Hutu population of Rwanda's north western provinces. By 1999, a programme of propaganda and Hutu integration into the national army succeeded in bringing <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> to the government side and the insurgency was defeated.|$|E
5|$|In September 2000, the Guardian {{newspaper}} revealed how a UK company, HPP, used legal loopholes {{to export}} CS {{to a private}} security company in Rwanda, in breach of United Nations sanctions. The Guardian also reported that CS was used by <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> militia in Rwanda to flush Tutsis out of buildings before hacking them to death.|$|E

50|$|Opération Turquoise is {{controversial}} for two reasons: accusations {{that it was}} a failed attempt to prop up <b>the</b> genocidal <b>Hutu</b> regime and that its mandate undermined the UNAMIR.|$|R
5|$|The RPF advance {{continued}} unchecked through February, {{its forces}} moving steadily south and gaining territory without opposition. They took Ruhengeri {{on the first}} day of fighting, and later the city of Byumba. As with the previous RPF advances, <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> civilians in the area fled en masse from the areas the RPF were taking, travelling back into the government-controlled territory. These exoduses were likely driven primarily by the fear of the RPF established by years of propaganda, although the RPF soldiers were guilty in some areas of small scale killing of Hutu civilians. Prunier attributes this to a combination of retribution for the massacre of Tutsi perpetrated in these areas in late January, as well as some indiscriminate killing. This RPF violence increased the fear felt by <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> population, but also served to further alienate the rebels from their potential allies in the democratic Rwandan opposition parties.|$|E
5|$|The {{revolution}} {{began in}} November 1959, {{with a series}} of riots and arson attacks on Tutsi homes following false reports of the murder of a Hutu sub-chief by Tutsi activists. Violence quickly spread throughout the country. The king and Tutsi politicians attempted a counterattack to seize power and ostracise <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> and the Belgians but were thwarted by Belgian colonel Guy Logiest, who was brought in by the colonial governor. Logiest reestablished law and order, beginning a programme to promote and protect <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> elite. The Belgians then replaced many Tutsi chiefs and sub-chiefs with Hutu, consigning King Kigeli V to figurehead status; Kigeli later fled the country. Despite continued anti-Tutsi violence, Belgium organised local elections in mid-1960. Hutu parties gained control of nearly all communes, effectively ending the revolution. Logiest and Hutu leader Grégoire Kayibanda declared Rwanda an autonomous republic in 1961, and the country became independent in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Belgium {{continued}} to rule Ruanda-Urundi (of which Rwanda formed the northern part) as a UN Trust Territory after the Second World War, with {{a mandate to}} oversee eventual independence. Tension escalated between the Tutsi, who favoured early independence, and <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> emancipation movement, culminating in the 1959 Rwandan Revolution: Hutu activists began killing Tutsi and destroying their houses, forcing more than 100,000 people to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. In 1961, the suddenly pro-Hutu Belgians held a referendum in which the country voted to abolish the monarchy. Rwanda was separated from Burundi and gained independence in 1962. Cycles of violence followed, with exiled Tutsi attacking from neighbouring countries and <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> retaliating with large-scale slaughter and repression of the Tutsi. In 1973, Juvénal Habyarimana took power in a military coup. Pro-Hutu discrimination continued, but there was greater economic prosperity and a reduced amount of violence against Tutsi. The Twa remained marginalised, and by 1990 were almost entirely {{forced out of the}} forests by the government; many became beggars. Rwanda's population had increased from 1.6million people in 1934 to 7.1million in 1989, leading to competition for land.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the course}} of our history we have {{exhibited}} expansive demonstrations of Genocide. Many of these being drawn on an ethnic origin line. Ethnic supremacy is assumed by one group within a culture, following some distinct action by an external group or from one of the ethnic groups. With European intervention in places like Rwanda, social institutions worked to socially construct an ethnic inferiority, distinguishing <b>the</b> <b>Hutu's</b> and Tutsi's from one another and causing what {{would be one of the}} most horrific demonstrations of genocide in modern history.|$|R
50|$|Generally, PALIPEHUTU's support comes {{more from}} the central region of Muramvya and Lake Tanganyika, whereas <b>the</b> main <b>Hutu</b> {{political}} party CNDD derives its support from the southern Bururi region.|$|R
25|$|The {{appeal was}} too late. The {{government}} troops and <b>the</b> Interahamwe <b>Hutu</b> paramilitaries perpetuated mass killings before fleeing from the RPF, which {{took control of}} Kabgayi on 2 June 1994.|$|R
5|$|Despite this refusal, Kigeli {{launched}} a counterattack against the rioters on 7 November, Mobilising thousands of loyal militia, Kigeli ordered the arrest or {{killing of a}} number of prominent Hutu leaders in the hope of quashing the peasant revolt; Joseph Gitera's brother, a prominent member of APROSOMA, was among the dead. Many of those arrested were brought to the king's palace at Nyanza, where they were tortured by UNAR officials. Gregoire Kayibanda was in hiding at the time, so was not captured. On 9 and 10 November, Kigeli's troops attacked the hill at Save, close to Astrida, aiming to reach Gitera's home and capture the APROSOMA leader. Gitera responded by assembling his own forces to defend the hill. The king's forces lacked the military expertise to win this battle, and eventually the Belgian authorities intervened in Save to prevent bloodshed, leading to Gitera's escape. Although Kigeli and UNAR remained more powerful and better equipped than <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> parties, they knew that the Belgians now strongly supported the latter; given enough time, <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> would gain the upper hand. Therefore, UNAR sought to ostracise Belgium from power and gain independence as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|Following Habyarimana's death, a {{military}} committee led by Colonel Théoneste Bagosora took immediate {{control of the}} country. Under the committee's direction, <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> militia Interahamwe and the Presidential Guard began to kill Hutu and Tutsi opposition politicians and other prominent Tutsi figures; within 24 hours they had killed all moderate leaders, including Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana. The killers then began targeting the entire Tutsi population, as well as moderate Hutu, beginning the Rwandan Genocide. Over the course of approximately 100 days, over 1,000,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks.|$|E
5|$|The best-known {{figure in}} the {{movement}} was Grégoire Kayibanda. Like most of <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> counter-elite Kayibanda had trained for the priesthood at the Nyakibanda seminary, although he was not ordained. After completing his education in 1948, he became a primary-school teacher. In 1952 Kayibanda succeeded Alexis Kagame {{as editor of the}} Catholic magazine, L'Ami. During the late 1950s he was a Travail, Fidélité, Progrès (TRAFIPRO) food-cooperative board member, edited the pro-Hutu Catholic magazine Kinyamateka, and founded the Mouvement Social Muhutu (MSM).|$|E
5000|$|When the Roman Catholic missionaries came to Rwanda in {{the late}} 1880s, they contributed to the [...] "Hamitic" [...] theory of race origins, which taught that the Tutsi were a {{superior}} race. The Church has been considered to have {{played a significant role}} in fomenting racial divisions between Hutu and Tutsi, in part because they found more willing converts among <b>the</b> majority <b>Hutu.</b> <b>The</b> Organisation of African Unity (OAU) report on the genocide states, ...|$|R
50|$|The constitution, which enshrines ethnically-based power-sharing, {{requires}} that 60% of ministers come from <b>the</b> ethnic <b>Hutu</b> majority while <b>the</b> remaining 40% {{come from the}} ethnic Tutsi minority. At least 30% of government ministers must be women.|$|R
50|$|Burundi {{is still}} trying to emerge from a civil war that began in 1993 when several groups drawn from <b>the</b> large <b>Hutu</b> {{majority}} took up arms against a government and army then dominated by a Tutsi elite.|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} coalesced, {{first into}} clans (ubwoko), and then, by 1700, into around eight kingdoms. The Kingdom of Rwanda, {{ruled by the}} Tutsi Nyiginya clan, became the dominant kingdom from the mid-eighteenth century, expanding {{through a process of}} conquest and assimilation, and achieving its greatest extent under the reign of King Kigeli Rwabugiri in 1853–1895. Rwabugiri expanded the kingdom west and north, and initiated administrative reforms which caused a rift to grow between <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> and Tutsi populations. The Berlin Conference of 1884 assigned the territory to Germany, which began a policy of ruling through the Rwandan monarchy, and supporting Tutsi chiefs around the country. Belgian forces took control of Rwanda and Burundi during World War I, and from 1926 began a policy of more direct colonial rule. The Belgians modernised the Rwandan economy, but Tutsi supremacy remained, leaving <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> disenfranchised. In 1935, Belgium introduced identity cards labelling each individual as either Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. While it had previously been possible for particularly wealthy Hutu to become honorary Tutsi, the identity cards prevented any further movement between the groups.|$|E
5|$|The war had {{its origins}} in the long-running dispute between <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> and Tutsi groups within the Rwandan population. The ancient Kingdom of Rwanda, ruled by Tutsi kings, began {{implementing}} increasingly anti-Hutu policies in the 19th century, a trend continued by European colonial authorities from 1895. Both Germany and Belgium ruled through the kings and favoured the Tutsi. <b>The</b> <b>Hutu</b> population revolted in 1959, {{with the support of}} Belgium, which had effected a sudden reversal of allegiance. Hutu activists burned Tutsi homes, killed those who fought back, and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated state in 1962. The revolution forced more than 100,000 Tutsi to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. These refugees lived in exile for several decades, agitating for a return to Rwanda, but were not capable of mounting a serious attack. Some refugees, including future RPF leaders Fred Rwigyema and Paul Kagame, fought in the Ugandan Bush War with Yoweri Museveni, becoming senior army officers in 1986 under Museveni's presidency. Relations between the refugees and the Ugandans soured in the late 1980s with Rwigyema and Kagame demoted, but Hutu president Habyarimana refused to allow the return of refugees. This created a strong desire among refugees to return by force, so Rwigyema and Kagame used their military expertise to turn the RPF into a battle-ready army.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disbanding}} of the camps, {{the defeated}} {{forces of the}} former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign into Rwanda from North Kivu. The insurgents maintained a presence in Rwanda's north western provinces and were supported by the predominantly Hutu population, {{many of whom had}} lived in the refugee camps before they were attacked. In addition to supporting the wars in the Congo, Kagame began a propaganda campaign to bring <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> to his side. He integrated former soldiers of the deposed genocidal regime's military into the RPF-dominated national army and appointed senior Hutu to key local government positions in the areas hit by insurgency. These tactics were eventually successful; by 1999, the population in the north west had stopped supporting the insurgency and the insurgents were mostly defeated.|$|E

Archbishop Courtney had been instrumental in the previous month's signing of a peace agreement between the Burundian government and <b>the</b> main opposition <b>Hutu</b> group. <b>The</b> militant <b>Hutu</b> group Forces for National Liberation, which had refused to sign the agreement, denied murdering Courtney.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> {{categories}} <b>Hutu</b> and Tutsi have an {{origin in}} pre-colonial Rwanda. [...] However, {{with the arrival}} of the Germans in about 1900, and particularly after the arrival of the Belgians in 1920, the categories began to [...] "rigidify" [...] and become thought of as ethnic. The modern history of Rwanda has in many ways been one of tension between <b>the</b> majority <b>Hutu</b> and minority Tutsi [...] "ethnic" [...] groups. While there has been much scholarship about the emergence of these separate ethnic identities, particularly through the colonial governance structures, before and after independence in 1961, people within Rwanda acted within the parameters of the Tutsi-Hutu division. [...] Regardless of the historical validity of the division, Rwandans in the late 20th century acted as if they were real.|$|R
5|$|Following the RPF victory, {{approximately}} two million Hutu fled to {{refugee camps in}} neighboring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan Genocide. The camps were {{set up by the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide. This regime was determined to return to power in Rwanda and began rearming, killing Tutsi residing in Zaire, and launching cross-border incursions in conjunction with the Interahamwe paramilitary group. By late 1996, <b>the</b> <b>Hutu</b> militants represented a serious threat to the new Rwandan regime, and Kagame launched a counteroffensive.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen regular {{national}} {{holidays are}} observed throughout the year, with others occasionally inserted by the government.

The last Saturday of each month is umuganda, a national morning of mandatory community service lasting from 8am to 11am, during which all able bodied people between 18 and 65 are expected to carry out community tasks such as cleaning streets or building homes for vulnerable people. Most normal services close down during umuganda, and public transportation is limited.|$|E
