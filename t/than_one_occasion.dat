40|$|SummaryBackgroundPertussis {{is mainly}} {{considered}} as a disease of childhood. However, {{an increasing number of}} adults with infection due to Bordetella pertussis is reported in the literature. MethodsA retrospective cohort study of patients with a new origin-cough of more than 3 weeks duration who were evaluated by an internal medicine–infectious diseases group practice in Athens, Greece during the period 10 / 2005 – 12 / 2007 was performed; patients underwent serological testing for B. pertussis infection. ResultsFive hundred and fifty-four adult patients underwent B. pertussis serological testing from whom 441 had a single IgM/IgG measurement. The percentage of seropositivity in the IgM/IgG B. pertussis serological testing was 71. 5 % in the population studied (397 / 554 patients; for patients who had IgM/IgG B. pertussis serological testing in more <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>occasions,</b> only the result of the first IgM/IgG measurement was taken into account for this analysis). For the subset of patients with a single IgM/IgG measurement, the percentage of seropositivity against B. pertussis was 70. 7 % (312 / 441 patients). ConclusionsB. pertussis infection should be {{considered as a}} significant pathogenic infection in a significant proportion of adult patients presenting a new origin-cough of more than 3 weeks duration. In order to reduce the burden of pertussis disease in adults as well as transmission of pertussis in children, booster vaccination is recommended for adolescents and adults...|$|R

Later he participated in a knife fight; fighting unarmed, fearing he'd injure his opponent, he received injuries which required a fortnight's hospitalization. After this incident he was finally expelled.|$|R

60|$|Yet these dawnings {{of sense}} and {{humanity}} were {{obscured by the}} clouds of the ancient superstition on more <b>than</b> <b>one</b> distinguished <b>occasion.</b> In 1676, Sir George Maxwell, of Pollock, apparently a man of melancholic and valetudinary habits, believed himself bewitched to death by six witches, one man and five women, who were leagued {{for the purpose of}} tormenting a clay image in his likeness. The chief evidence on the subject was a vagabond girl, pretending to be deaf and dumb. But as her imposture was afterwards discovered and herself punished, it is reasonably to be concluded that she had herself formed the picture or image of Sir George, and had hid it where it was afterwards found in consequence of her own information. In the meantime, five of the accused were executed, and the sixth only escaped on account of extreme youth.|$|R
