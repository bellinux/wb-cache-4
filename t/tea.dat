5|$|Adams and the {{correspondence}} committees promoted {{opposition to the}} <b>Tea</b> Act. In every colony except Massachusetts, protesters were able to force the <b>tea</b> consignees to resign or to return the <b>tea</b> to England. In Boston, however, Governor Hutchinson was determined to hold his ground. He convinced the <b>tea</b> consignees, two of whom were his sons, not to back down. The Boston Caucus and then the Town Meeting attempted to compel the consignees to resign, but they refused. With the <b>tea</b> ships about to arrive, Adams and the Boston Committee of Correspondence contacted nearby committees to rally support.|$|E
5|$|Although {{each type}} of <b>tea</b> has {{different}} taste, smell, and visual appearance, <b>tea</b> processing for all <b>tea</b> types consists of a very similar set of methods with only minor variations. Without careful moisture and temperature control during its manufacture and life thereafter, fungi will grow on <b>tea.</b> This form of fungus causes real fermentation that will contaminate the <b>tea</b> and may render the <b>tea</b> unfit for consumption.|$|E

50|$|Fermented <b>teas</b> can {{be divided}} {{according}} to how they are produced. Piled <b>teas,</b> such as the Chinese post-fermented <b>teas,</b> and the Toyama kurocha produced in Japan, are fermented with naturally occurring fungus under relatively dry conditions. Other fermented <b>teas,</b> called pickled <b>teas,</b> are fermented in a wet process with lactic acid bacteria. Pickled <b>teas</b> include miang from Thailand and awabancha from Japan. A third category, including the Japanese Goishicha and Ishizuchi-kurocha, is fermented with the piled and pickling methods successively.|$|R

5|$|During {{the earlier}} Northern and Southern dynasties (420–589), {{and perhaps even}} earlier, the {{drinking}} of <b>tea</b> (Camellia sinensis) became popular in southern China. <b>Tea</b> was viewed then as a beverage of tasteful pleasure and with pharmacological purpose as well. During the Tang dynasty, <b>tea</b> became synonymous with everything sophisticated in society. The poet Lu Tong (790–835) devoted most of his poetry to his love of <b>tea.</b> The 8th-century author Lu Yu (known as the Sage of <b>Tea)</b> even wrote a treatise {{on the art of}} drinking <b>tea,</b> called The Classic of <b>Tea.</b> Although wrapping paper had been used in China since the 2nd century BC, during the Tang dynasty the Chinese were using wrapping paper as folded and sewn square bags to hold and preserve the flavor of <b>tea</b> leaves. Indeed, paper found many other uses besides writing and wrapping during the Tang era.|$|E

50|$|Wuyi <b>teas</b> are {{generally}} dark, spanning the range between black <b>teas</b> and darker oolongs, and are typically twisted {{into thin strips}} rather than curled into a ball shape like Anxi or Taiwan oolong <b>teas.</b> They are fired heavily, as were most oolong <b>teas</b> historically, and have a characteristic smoky flavor with notes of stone fruit.|$|R
5|$|Green tea: This <b>tea</b> has {{undergone}} {{the least amount}} of oxidation. The oxidation process is halted by the quick application of heat after <b>tea</b> picking, either with steam, the method preferred in Japan, or by dry roasting and cooking in hot pans, preferred in Chinese <b>tea</b> processing. <b>Tea</b> leaves may be left to dry as separate leaves or they may be rolled into small pellets to make gunpowder <b>tea.</b> This process is time consuming and is typically done with pekoes of higher quality. The <b>tea</b> is processed within one to two days of harvesting, and if done correctly retains most of the chemical composition of the fresh leaves from which it was produced. Variation in steaming time for fixation or processing from additional stages of rolling and drying are sometimes used to improve or altering the flavour for types of green <b>tea.</b> Green <b>tea</b> leaves undergo fixation by either roasting (panning) or steaming. Generally, roasted varieties are richer in flavor, while steamed varieties are more vivid in color.|$|E
5|$|In May 1773, the British Parliament {{passed the}} <b>Tea</b> Act, a tax law {{to help the}} {{struggling}} East India Company, one of Great Britain's most important commercial institutions. Britons could buy smuggled Dutch <b>tea</b> more cheaply than the East India Company's <b>tea</b> because of the heavy taxes imposed on <b>tea</b> imported into Great Britain, and so the company amassed a huge surplus of <b>tea</b> {{that it could not}} sell. The British government's solution to the problem was to sell the surplus in the colonies. The <b>Tea</b> Act permitted the East India Company to export <b>tea</b> directly to the colonies for the first time, bypassing most of the merchants who had previously acted as middlemen. This measure was a threat to the American colonial economy because it granted the <b>Tea</b> Company a significant cost advantage over local <b>tea</b> merchants and even local <b>tea</b> smugglers, driving them out of business. The act also reduced the taxes on <b>tea</b> paid by the company in Britain, but kept the controversial Townshend duty on <b>tea</b> imported in the colonies. A few merchants in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Charlestown were selected to receive the company's <b>tea</b> for resale. In late 1773, seven ships were sent to the colonies carrying East India Company <b>tea,</b> including four bound for Boston.|$|E
5|$|In the 1760s, the British Parliament's {{passage of}} the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts, {{combined}} with other frustrations, increased political tension and anger against England in the colonies. Philadelphia residents joined boycotts of British goods. After the <b>Tea</b> Act in 1773, there were threats against anyone who would store <b>tea</b> and any ships that brought <b>tea</b> up the Delaware. After the Boston <b>Tea</b> Party, a shipment of <b>tea</b> had arrived in December, on the ship the Polly. A committee told the captain to depart without unloading his cargo.|$|E

5|$|Kalimpong {{is a major}} ginger {{growing area}} of India. Kalimpong {{and the state of}} Sikkim {{together}} contribute 15 percent of ginger produced in India. The Darjeeling Himalayan hill region is internationally famous for its <b>tea</b> industry. However, most of the <b>tea</b> gardens are on the western side of Teesta river (towards the town of Darjeeling) and so <b>tea</b> gardens near Kalimpong contribute only 4percent of total <b>tea</b> production of the region. In Kalimpong division, 90percent of land is cultivable but only 10percent is used for <b>tea</b> production. Kalimpong is well known for its flower export industry—especially for its wide array of indigenous orchids and gladioli.|$|E
5|$|Post-fermented tea: Teas {{that are}} allowed to undergo a second {{oxidation}} after the fixation of the <b>tea</b> leaves, such as Pu-erh, Liu'an, and Liubao, are collectively referred to as secondary or post-fermentation teas in English. In Chinese they are categorized as Dark <b>tea</b> or black <b>tea.</b> This {{is not to be}} confused with the English term Black <b>tea,</b> known in Chinese as red <b>tea.</b> Pu-erh, also known as Póu léi (Polee) in Cantonese is the most common type of post-fermentation <b>tea</b> in the market.|$|E

5|$|<b>Tea</b> is {{the second}} most {{consumed}} beverage in the world, after water. Argo was founded in response to a realization that Americans had so few <b>tea</b> offerings that they generally were unfamiliar with anything but bagged teas. At the time, most <b>tea</b> retailers either supplied bulk <b>tea</b> for home brewing or traditional sit-down service, but Argo focused on premium specialty drinks in paper cups. Meanwhile, a minority of Asian immigrants from countries such as India, Vietnam and China where <b>tea</b> is the national beverage were spreading some of their traditions. Argo endeavored to emphasize the healthy aspects of <b>tea</b> as an alternative to coffee. When it was founded, Argo was part of a field of blossoming <b>tea</b> cafe franchises meeting a burgeoning demand. By 2002, there were 1,100 tearooms with sit-down service. In 2003, retail sales of <b>tea</b> totaled $5.1billion, and in 2005, as the specialty <b>tea</b> market was growing 20percent per year, the total retail <b>tea</b> market was expected to surpass $10 billion by 2010.|$|E

5|$|Tea: The <b>tea</b> {{plant is}} {{indigenous}} to western Yunnan; {{by the mid}} 2nd millennium BC, <b>tea</b> was being consumed in Yunnan for medicinal purposes. <b>Tea</b> drinking was already an established custom in the daily life in this area {{as shown by the}} Contract with a Slave, written by Wang Bao in 59 BC. This written record also reveals that <b>tea</b> was processed and used as a drink instead of a medicinal herb, emerged no later than the 1st century BC. Early Chinese <b>tea</b> culture began from the time of Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) to the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420–589) when <b>tea</b> was widely used by Chinese gentry, but only took its initial shape during the Tang Dynasty (618–907).|$|E

5|$|Teapot: The teapot {{was invented}} during the Yuan Dynasty, <b>tea</b> {{preparation}} in previous dynasties did not utilize a teapot. In the Tang Dynasty, a cauldron {{was used to}} boil grounded <b>tea,</b> which was served in bowls. Song Dynasty <b>tea</b> was made by pouring water boiled using a kettle into a bowl with finely ground <b>tea</b> leaves. A brush was then used to stir the <b>tea.</b> The innovation of the teapot, a vessel that steeps <b>tea</b> leaves in boiling water, occurs during the late Yuan dynasty. Written evidence of a teapot appears in the Yuan Dynasty text, Jiyuan Conghua, which describes a teapot that the author, Cai Shizhan, bought from the scholar Sun Daoming. By the Ming Dynasty, teapots were widespread in China.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the <b>tea</b> {{processing}} corresponds intimately with the role that <b>tea</b> played in Chinese society and the preferred methods of its consumption in Ancient Chinese society. Variations of these processing techniques are still used in modern <b>tea</b> processing albeit being far more mechanized.|$|E
5|$|The innate flavour of {{the dried}} <b>tea</b> leaves is {{determined}} by the type of cultivar of the <b>tea</b> bush, the quality of the plucked <b>tea</b> leaves, and the manner and quality of the production processing they undergo. After processing, a <b>tea</b> may be blended with other teas or mixed with flavourants to alter the flavour of the final <b>tea.</b>|$|E
50|$|As herbal <b>teas</b> can be {{composed}} of any plant material, including some plants that {{are known to be}} toxic, the specific ingredients must be checked individually for health and safety.
