Gale warnings were in effect for the Florida Keys from the evening of August 6 into the early morning of August 8. As Allen approached its final landfall, the northeast Mexican coast and Texas coast were placed under a hurricane watch from the morning of August 8 until the morning of August 9 for Mexico and the afternoon of August 9 for Texas. Hurricane warnings were posted for the Texas coast during the afternoon of August 8, and were lowered north of Freeport, Texas during the afternoon of August 9 and south of Freeport during the afternoon of August 10.

5|$|For free {{entertainment}} one can stroll along Strøget, especially between Nytorv and Højbro Plads, {{which in}} <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> and evening {{is a bit}} like an impromptu three-ring circus with musicians, magicians, jugglers and other street performers.|$|E
5000|$|The lease was {{canceled}} that November 25 and subsequently {{turned over to}} WHTX operator JL Communications, LLC (managed by Jim Davison and Laurel Taylor) who temporarily flipped the station to a partial simulcast of WHTX before relaunching the talk format as [...] "Valley Talk 1540 WYCL" [...] in January 2012. Some of the talk hosts on WYCL included a simulcast of WHTX morning host Gary Rhamy, Louie B. Free in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> morning/early <b>afternoons,</b> Frank Bellamy in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoons,</b> Don Hanni III on Saturday afternoons (and early evenings in spring and summer months) and syndicated programs hosted by Jim Blasingame and Maureen Anderson.|$|R
2500|$|BBC One has {{traditionally}} been the home of children's television: Blue Peter had been broadcast on the channel prior to the Children's BBC strand, and sections such as the pre-school Watch with Mother being transmitted on the channel for several decades. This became more pronounced with the launch of Children's BBC, later renamed [...] "CBBC". This new strand was broadcast primarily on BBC One in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoons,</b> as well as Saturday and Sunday mornings also such as Going Live! and Live & Kicking, each lasting two to three hours. The launch in 2002 of dedicated digital channels for this content —the CBBC Channel and CBeebies—did not affect this provision. Combined with BBC Two, the channel broadcast 2,195 hours of children's programmes in 2010, mostly in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoons</b> on weekdays. Saturday morning children's programming moved to BBC Two in 2006 following a three-month trial.|$|R

5|$|At {{the landing}} zones, Brigadier Hicks was {{informed}} that in Urquhart's and Lathbury's absence, he was acting divisional commander. He was also told to send one of his units—the South Staffordshires (which was not complete and was awaiting its full complement {{of men in the}} second lift)—to Arnhem to help with the advance to the bridge. The South Staffords departed in the morning and linked up with the 1st Parachute Battalion in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{conditions}} on Sunday, 29 November were extremely unsettled. There were {{a series of}} thunderstorm cells that formed {{early in the morning}} — despite it being more common for thunderstorms to form in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> in the south-east Queensland region. These storms, which had periodic bursts of severe lightning, cleared quickly.|$|E

The procession moves down St. John's Street (ulica Świętojańska), surrounded by enthusiastic Warsaw residents and visitors. The deputies are protected by soldiers.|$|E
5000|$|In the 19th century, Pandacan was {{described}} as a [...] "Little Venice" [...] or [...] "Little Italy" [...] for its numerous canals or estuaries leading to the Pasig River. Many would leisurely row through the estuaries in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoons</b> as described by Francisco Balagtas in his early writings. Pandacan was home to balladeers and a source of musicians in the early times.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of KHHB's schedule {{was composed of}} short films and religious music videos. The station also carried syndicated reruns of the classic shows Northern Exposure, The Nanny, Mad About You, Charlie's Angels, Starsky and Hutch, Mission: Impossible and Soap during <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoons</b> and prime time. In late December, reruns of Law and Order: Criminal Intent were phased into the schedule.|$|R

5|$|This violent multiple-vortex wedge tornado, rated EF5, {{began in}} the Lakeview {{community}} northeast of Geraldine, Alabama, at 6:19 p.m. CDT (2319 UTC), during <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> of April 27. The tornado tracked northeastward generally parallel to and just east of Highway 75 through Fyffe, Rainsville, and Sylvania and into Georgia, killing 25 people.|$|E
5|$|Tornado {{occurrence}} {{is highly}} dependent {{on the time of}} day, because of solar heating. Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. Destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The Gainesville Tornado of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time.|$|E
5|$|A {{detachment}} of 18 {{men of the}} 1st The Royal Dragoons, commanded by Captain Methuen, arrived in Ely from Bury on 23 May in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon.</b> They marched through the streets as a show of force, remaining all night. The following afternoon, 24 May, the troops marched on Littleport, led by Sir Henry Bate Dudley and John Bacon, a Bow Street constable. They were followed by the Royston troop of volunteer yeomanry cavalry summoned earlier by Henry Law, and a militia of gentlemen and inhabitants of Ely.|$|E
50|$|Reruns of {{this version}} were popular on local stations, usually during <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoons</b> or early evenings, {{in the early}} 1970s. In <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1980s, they {{found their way to}} Nick at Nite and, {{beginning}} in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1990s, to sister cable channel TV Land. From October 1, 2011, to April 26, 2013, the series ran daily on digital cable channel Antenna TV and before that, the show aired on Retro Television Network.|$|R

5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of England's second innings, Washbrook and Edrich fell early, leaving England at 39/2. This brought {{together}} England's leading batsmen, Hutton and Compton, who took the score to 121 without further loss by stumps on the third day. Miller battled with Hutton and Compton through the afternoon, delivering five bouncers in the last over of the day. One of these struck Hutton high on his left arm. The batsmen survived, but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd. The English had the better of <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> period, scoring 82 runs together in 70 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Bradman got off {{the mark}} from his first ball, which Compton {{prevented}} from going for four with a diving stop near the boundary. Hassett was restrained while Bradman attacked, taking three fours from one Edrich over. Bradman was 31 and Hassett 13 as the tourists reached stumps at 63/1. The Australian captain did {{the majority of the}} scoring in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> adding 31 in a partnership of 50. The tourists batted with little discomfort on a pitch that was still offering even bounce at a gentle pace.|$|E

50|$|The {{village of}} Chokmanovo, Bulgaria is in Municipality of Smolyan, in the Arda {{valley of the}} Rhodopi Mountain range. It is 8km south {{of the town of}} Smolyan and 25km from the ski resort Pamporovo. The region is very sunny, and the village is near the top of a {{southern}} slope so it receives direct sun more than 300 days a year. It has 4 seasons, is snowy in winter and subject to spectacular thunderstorms in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoons</b> of summer.|$|R
5|$|Dust {{kicked up}} by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the {{darkness}} of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly {{the sound of an}} approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's updraft base, which is rain-free, making them visible. Also, most tornadoes occur in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. Night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.|$|E
5|$|Méliès's film studio, {{which he}} had built in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis in 1897, was a greenhouse-like {{building}} with glass walls and a glass ceiling to let in as much sunlight as possible, a concept used by most still photography studios from the 1860s onward; it was built with the same dimensions as Méliès's own Théâtre Robert-Houdin (13.5×6.6m). Throughout his film career, Méliès worked on a strict schedule of planning films in the morning, filming scenes during the brightest hours of the day, tending to the film laboratory and the Théâtre Robert-Houdin in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> and attending performances at Parisian theaters in the evening.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} day of battle, most of both armies had assembled. The Union line was laid out in a {{defensive}} formation resembling a fishhook. In <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> of July 2, Lee launched a heavy assault on the Union left flank, and fierce fighting raged at Little Round Top, the Wheatfield, Devil's Den, and the Peach Orchard. On the Union right, Confederate demonstrations escalated into full-scale assaults on Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill. All across the battlefield, despite significant losses, the Union defenders held their lines.|$|E

50|$|Road links are excellent, but heavily congested, {{with the}} A47 {{bisecting}} the community - running to Hinckley, Birmingham and Leicester. There is good {{access to the}} A46 road where it bypasses Leicester, {{and from there to}} the M1 and M69. Congestion on the A47 particularly in the mornings, for city bound traffic, is a major issue for commuters in Leicester Forest East, and for those using this road. Equally, there is congestion on Ratby Lane in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoons</b> for traffic leaving the A46 and M1 wishing to join the A47 from this direction.|$|R
5|$|Pied currawongs are {{generally}} tree-dwelling, hunting and foraging some metres above the ground, and thus {{able to share}} territory with the ground-foraging Australian magpie. Birds roost in forested areas or large trees at night, disperse to forage {{in the early morning}} and return in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Although often solitary or encountered in small groups, the species may form larger flocks of fifty or more birds in autumn and winter. On the ground, a pied currawong hops or struts.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} {{is mostly}} active {{during the morning}} and <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> with the hottest {{hours of the day}} being spent in rest. These extremely agile and wary animals can run at speeds of up to , waving their tails and tossing their heads. An analysis of the activity of blue wildebeest at the Serengeti National Park showed that the animals devoted over half of their total time to rest, 33% to grazing, 12% to moving about (mostly walking) and a little to social interactions. However, there were variations among different age and sex groups.|$|E
