25|$|The International Forces East Timor (INTERFET) {{coalition}} began deploying to East Timor on 20 September 1999, as a non-UN force {{operating in}} accordance with UN Resolutions. Led by Australia, who contributed 5,500 personnel and the force commander, Major General Peter Cosgrove, it was tasked with restoring peace and security, protecting and supporting UNAMET, and facilitating humanitarian assistance. The Australian Deployable Joint Force Headquarters provided overall command and control. The main Australian combat element included infantry and cavalry provided by the 3rd Brigade. Due {{to the nature of}} the operation the force deployed without its artillery and other heavy weapons and equipment; however, 105mm and 155mm guns and Leopard tanks were available and on standby in Darwin for rapid deployment if required. It was supported by the 3rd Combat Engineer Regiment, 103rd Signals Squadron, and elements of the 3rd Brigade Administrative Support Battalion. Twelve Black Hawk helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment were also deployed. Other force level troops included military police, an intelligence company, an electronic warfare squadron, elements of an artillery locating battery, and <b>topographic</b> <b>survey</b> personnel.|$|E

This paper focuses on the impact of the SAR image quality and SAR image interpretation in the application of <b>topographic</b> <b>surveying</b> and mapping, which caused by the low accuracy of SAR Doppler parameter and range migration, and as well as on a more practical way to improve the precise of SAR Doppler parameter with a visualization approach, so a better Doppler parameter can be utilized in <b>topographic</b> <b>surveying</b> and mapping. 1...|$|R

2500|$|On June 5, 1889, {{five days}} after the dam breach flood, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) {{appointed}} a committee of four prominent engineers to investigate the cause of the disaster.

Francis, a hydraulic engineer best known for his work related to canals, flood control, turbine design, dam construction, and hydraulic calculations. [...] Francis was {{a founding member of the}} ASCE and served as its president from November 1880 to January 1882. The ASCE committee visited the South Fork dam, reviewed the original engineering design of the dam and modifications made during repairs, interviewed eyewitnesses, commissioned a <b>topographic</b> <b>survey</b> of the dam remnants, and performed hydrologic calculations. [...] In their final report they concluded the South Fork dam would have failed even if it had been maintained within the original design specifications, i.e., with a higher embankment crest and with five large discharge pipes at the dam’s base. [...] This claim by the ASCE committee has now been challenged.|$|E
