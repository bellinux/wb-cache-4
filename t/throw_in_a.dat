The band Fat Freddy's Drop." [...] The band has been {{categorised}} under many genres, and members say many of those genres helped shape their musical style: delta blues, jazz, dub, soul, techno, and contemporary rhythm and blues. Musical styles heard while on tour have also shaped their sound; Dr Boondigga and the Big BW was influenced by contemporary German, Portuguese, and Bhangra music while touring {{in the years before}} its release.|$|E

500|$|The first {{recorded}} {{use of the}} term McCarthyism was in a political cartoon by Washington Post editorial cartoonist Herbert Block (aka Herblock), published on March 29, 1950. The cartoon depicted four leading Republicans trying to push an elephant (the traditional symbol of the Republican Party) to stand on a platform atop a teetering stack of ten tar buckets, the topmost of which was labeled [...] "McCarthyism". Block later wrote that there was [...] "nothing particularly ingenious about the term, which is simply used to represent a national affliction that can hardly be described in any other way. If anyone has a prior claim on it, he's welcome to the word and to the junior senator from Wisconsin along with it. I will also <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> set of free dishes and a case of soap." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team learned—some nine {{weeks prior to}} the start of filming—of a diary containing Logue's original notes on his treatment of the Duke. They then went back and re-worked the script to reflect what was in the notes. Hooper said some of the film's most memorable lines, such as at the climax, when Logue smiles, [...] "You still stammered on the W" [...] to the King, who replies, [...] "I had to <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few so they would know it was me" [...] were direct quotations from Logue's notes. Changes from the script to reflect the historical record included Michael Gambon improvising the ramblings of George V as he signed away authority, and the decision in the opening scene to dress the Duke in an overcoat rather than regal finery.|$|E

500|$|Coonskin, {{advertised as}} an {{exploitation}} film, was given limited distribution and soon disappeared from theaters. Initial reviews were negative; Playboy commented that [...] "Bakshi seems to <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> little of everything and he can't quite pull it together." [...] Eventually, positive reviews appeared in The Hollywood Reporter, New York Amsterdam News (an African American newspaper) and elsewhere. The New York Times Richard Eder said the film [...] "could be [...] masterpiece [...] a shattering successful effort {{to use an}} uncommon form—cartoons and live action combined to convey the hallucinatory violence and frustration of American city life, specifically black city life [...] lyrically violent, yet in no way [...] exploit violence". Variety called it a [...] "brutal satire from the streets". A reviewer for the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner wrote, [...] "Certainly, it will outrage some and, indeed, it's not Disney. [...] The dialog it has obviously generated—if not the box office obstacles—seems joltingly healthy." [...] Bakshi called Coonskin his best film.|$|E
500|$|Howard {{originally}} envisioned Maximus as the [...] "ultimate super-cop", jokingly {{referring to}} the character as [...] "the Tommy Lee Jones of horses". Attempting to make Maximus feel like a [...] "fresh" [...] character, the filmmakers researched several historical horses from both animated and live-action films {{to ensure that the}} character would be unique and different enough from his predecessors. Greno explained that [...] "Maximus ... could have easily slipped into the category of, 'Oh, I've seen that before.'" [...] To prevent this, the filmmakers referenced [...] "a board with photos of all the different animated horses that had been done". Howard explained that Maximus was originally conceived as a [...] "pretty serious" [...] character, but eventually developed into a funnier and more likeable horse as the animators continued to draw him with dog-like attributes. Both Pascal and Maximus, who according to the Austin American-Statesman are responsible for providing the film with the majority of its comic relief, were eventually written into the film by screenwriter Dan Fogelman. Analyzing the characters' roles in the film, HitFix observed that [...] "There's a simplicity to it all that I admire, and you <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few anthropomorphized animals so everyone laughs a lot, and that's the Disney recipe". One critic wrote about Maximus: ...|$|E

[...] According to Jon Lachonis of UGO, Miles and the other new characters have been well received by fans. [...] Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune said that Leung is [...] "terrifically intense" [...] in his portrayal. [...] Paige Albiniak of the New York Post praised the cast addition. [...] Diane Werts of Newsday thought that [...] "Ken Leung and Michael Emerson may be the two current most interesting actors in this mix". [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger commented that [...] "Miles the dustbusting ghostbuster is easily my favorite [...] … why not <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> medium [...] … I love the sarcastic energy he brings. [...] Sawyer and Ben can't {{be the only ones}} getting the good one-liners". [...] After Miles' introduction in the second episode of the fourth season, Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Leung made [...] "a strong impression" [...] and was well cast. [...] Chris Carabott of IGN stated that [...] "Leung does an adequate job of getting Miles' arrogant brand of confidence across." ...|$|E

500|$|Walton's {{next major}} {{composition}} was the massive choral cantata Belshazzar's Feast (1931). It {{began as a}} work on a modest scale; the BBC commissioned a piece for small chorus, orchestra {{of no more than}} fifteen players, and soloist. Osbert Sitwell constructed a text, selecting verses from several books of the Old Testament and the Book of Revelation. As Walton worked on it, he found that his music required far larger forces than the BBC proposed to allow, and Beecham rescued him by programming the work for the 1931 Leeds Festival, to be conducted by Malcolm Sargent. Walton later recalled Beecham as saying, [...] "As you'll never hear the work again, my boy, why not <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> couple of brass bands?" [...] During early rehearsals, the Leeds chorus members found Walton's music difficult to master, and it was falsely rumoured in London musical circles that Beecham had been obliged to send Sargent to Leeds to quell a revolt. The first performance was a triumph for the composer, conductor and performers. A contemporary critic wrote, [...] "Those who experienced the tremendous impact of its first performance had full justification for feeling that a great composer had arisen in our land, a composer to whose potentialities it was impossible to set any limits." [...] The work has remained a staple of the choral repertoire.|$|E
500|$|Bret Hart's {{feud with}} Bob Backlund dated {{back to the}} July 30, 1994 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling. Backlund {{believed}} that he had won the match and the WWF World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Hart. The match had not ended, however, and Hart pinned Backlund. When Hart tried to shake Backlund's hand after the match, Backlund slapped {{him in the face}} and locked him in a crossface chickenwing. After that Backlund began acting in a completely different manner than he had before, demanding respect from his fellow wrestlers insisting that they call him [...] "Mr. Backlund" [...] and using the crossface chickenwing, a hold he said was unbreakable, on them if they did not adhere to his wishes. He claimed that he had never truly been beaten for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship on December 26, 1983, as the match ended when his manager, Arnold Skaaland, threw a towel into the ring rather than allowing Backlund to submit to The Iron Sheik's camel clutch. Playing off of this, a rematch between Hart and Backlund was signed for Survivor Series. The match was signed as a submission match, but with the stipulation that the only way for a wrestler to win was to have the other person <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> towel. Since this required a wrestler to have a cornerman, each of the participants chose one. The challenger chose Owen Hart, while the champion went with Davey Boy Smith.|$|E
500|$|Time {{contributor}} James Poniewozik {{wrote that}} [...] "Black Light Attack!" [...] presented the balance 30 Rock [...] "has reached with Liz Lemon's character, {{allowing her to}} be simultaneously nerdy/awkward... and strong... <b>Throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> steady stream of solid throwaway jokes... {{and you had a}} worthy toofer." [...] Nick Catucci for New York magazine enjoyed the episode, particularly Jenna's line [...] "Would a mother be going on a sex tour of Vietnam?", after telling Liz about her booked role as a mother on Gossip Girl, as a [...] "classic Jenna line, more absurd than hilarious", and that the character's rendition of [...] "Forever Young" [...] was a highlight. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger opined that this episode [...] "made the best use yet of Cheyenne Jackson's Danny", and that he for once enjoyed [...] "Jenna's narcissism and self-delusion" [...] subplot, and her [...] "late attempt" [...] to seem young. [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad enjoyed [...] "Black Light Attack!", though, his only complain was that 30 Rock did not focus more on the fictional show TGS, and said he would [...] "like to get back to more of that." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons remarked that this episode and [...] "Klaus and Greta" [...] were terrific, and what stood out from both airings [...] "was how much serialized plot these two eps covered... For a show that's usually so episodic, it was an interesting—totally successful—change of pace." ...|$|E

2500|$|In addition, {{the corner}} is {{responsible}} for stopping the fight if they feel their fighter is in grave danger of permanent injury. The corner will occasionally <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> white towel to signify a boxer's surrender (the idiomatic phrase [...] "to throw in the towel", meaning to give up, derives from this practice). This {{can be seen in}} the fight between Diego Corrales and Floyd Mayweather. In that fight, Corrales' corner surrendered despite Corrales' steadfast refusal.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} basic {{defensive}} principles is the [...] "force". The defender marking the thrower essentially tries to force them to <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> particular direction (to the [...] "force side" [...] or [...] "open side"), whilst making {{it difficult for them to}} throw in the opposite direction (the [...] "break side"). Downfield defenders make it hard for the receiving players to get free on the open/force side, knowing throws to the break side are less likely to be accurate. The space is divided in this way because it is very hard for the player marking the disc to stop every throw, and very hard for the downfield defenders to cover every space.|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{has clearly}} spelled out the {{importance}} of her characters to her stories: [...] “As far as I’m concerned, character is everything. I never did see why I have to <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> plot, too.” [...] In an earlier (1977) interview, she stated that “the real joy of writing is how people can surprise one. My people wander around my study until the novel is done. It’s one reason I’m {{very careful not to}} write about people I don’t like. If I find somebody creeping in that I’m not really fond of, I usually take him out.” [...] Pollitt had even earlier noted how Tyler’s characters seem to take on {{a life of their own}} that she doesn’t seem to totally control: “Her complex, crotchety inventions surprise us, but one senses they surprise her too.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Ed Power (The Independent) {{provided}} {{the group with}} a positive review stating, [...] "Backstreet also deserve credit for not over-indulging in the customary patronising patter you get from most pop acts.

Sure, they haven't re-invented the wheel musically, yet they prove in style that they've already left a considerable legacy of entertainment." [...] Vicki Kellaway (Liverpool Echo) gave the band a 10 out 10 remarking, [...] "They are utterly shameless.
