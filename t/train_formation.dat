50|$|The {{colors in}} the cliffs are created by the large amounts of {{minerals}} in the rock. The cliffs are composed of the Munising Formation of 500-million-year-old Cambrian Period sandstone. The Munising Formation sits atop Precambrian sandstone of the Jacobsville Formation. The mottled red Jacobsville Formation is the oldest rock in the park. On top of the Munising Formation is the younger Au <b>Train</b> <b>Formation</b> from the Ordovician Period. The Au <b>Train</b> <b>Formation</b> is a hard sandstone and acts as a cap over the other layers. Streaks {{on the face of}} the cliffs come from the groundwater leaching out of the rock. With it come iron (red), manganese (black-white), limonite (yellow-brown), copper (pink-green), and other minerals. As the water evaporates, these minerals leave streaks of color.|$|E

50|$|As of 2015, the {{majority}} of trains are in two-car (M-M) formations. Two-car formations are no longer limited to peak hours only and are now used at all times. This {{is due to the}} increase in ridership and the large number of apartments around Bukit Panjang. The units are limited to a two-car <b>train</b> <b>formation</b> because of station length.|$|E
50|$|The ten-coach {{train consist}} of six {{sleeping}} cars, a lounge car, a dining car, and observation cars {{at either end}} of the train with open balconies.

This {{should not be confused}} with the totally different procedure of adding a banking engine to the rear of a train to assist up a hill or away from a heavy start.|$|E
50|$|All {{carriages}} are air conditioned. Each <b>train</b> <b>formation</b> has {{first and}} second class carriages and, in most cases, a restaurant/bistro carriage. The availability of power sockets is constantly improved, sometimes even in second class. The maximal speed of all train types is 200 km/h, except for about half of type IV carriages {{that have not yet}} been upgraded and have a maximum speed of 160 km/h.|$|E
50|$|A typical <b>train</b> <b>formation</b> {{consists}} of nine sleeping cars, three seating lounge cars, and a restaurant car. Motor cars can be booked for transportation on the train, and car transporting carriages {{are added to}} the formation as required.
