5|$|This {{causes a}} power flicker in the Hub; Ianto makes an excuse <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> himself and finds Tanizaki's body. As he leaves Lisa {{to hide the}} body, she drains even more power by {{re-entering}} the conversion unit. Believing the Hub is under attack, team leader Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) sends Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) and Owen Harper (Burn Gorman) to the basement where they find the abandoned conversion unit. Jack runs down to find Owen unconscious and Gwen about to be converted. He stops the process and attempts to shoot Lisa, but Ianto stops him, allowing Lisa to escape. Ianto pleads with Jack that they try to save her, but Jack affirms {{that there is no}} cure.|$|E

2500|$|Appearing live on Sean Hannity's {{syndicated}} {{radio program}} on July 10, 2007, Thompson was quizzed by the host about his {{attitude towards the}} FairTax proposal, espoused {{by many of the}} conservatives in the audience. Thompson stopped short of endorsing FairTax outright, but spoke approvingly of the idea of replacing the current income tax with a consumption tax, and promised <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> if elected. However, [...] "he is under fire for reportedly saying he would sign legislation replacing all federal taxes with a sales tax, only to have his spokeswoman deny such a pledge." [...] He also criticized the Internal Revenue Code as inefficient, maddeningly complex, and expensive to comply with.|$|E
2500|$|Reverend Hale {{arrives and}} begins his investigation. Before leaving, Giles fatefully remarks {{that he has}} noticed his wife reading unknown books and asks Hale <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> Hale {{questions}} Rev. Parris, Abigail and Tituba closely over the girls' activities in the woods. As the facts emerge, Abigail claims Tituba forced her to drink blood. Tituba counters that Abigail begged her to conjure a deadly curse. Parris threatens to whip Tituba to death if she doesn't confess to witchcraft. Tituba breaks down and falsely claims that the Devil is bewitching her and others in town. With prompting from Hale and Putnam, Tituba accuses Sarah Osborne and Sarah Good of witchcraft. Mrs. Putnam identifies Osborne as her former midwife and asserts that she must have killed her children. Abigail decides to play along with Tituba {{in order to prevent}} others from discovering her affair with Proctor, whose wife she had tried to curse out of jealousy. She leaps up, begins contorting wildly, and names Osborne and Good, as well as Bridget Bishop as having been [...] "dancing with the devil". Betty suddenly rises and begins mimicking Abigail’s movements and words, and accuses George Jacobs. As the curtain closes, the three continue with their accusations as Hale orders the arrest of the named people and sends for judges to try them.|$|E

60|$|The rugged, {{overhanging}} {{walls of}} the cañon grew sinister in Shefford's sight. They were jaws. And the river--that made him shudder <b>to</b> <b>look</b> down <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> The little whirling pits were eyes peering into his, and they raced on with the boat, disappeared, and came again, always with the little, hollow gurgles.|$|R
60|$|He {{caught me}} by the wrist, and forced me <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> his face. <b>It</b> was unwise of him to touch me against my will, for the fire flashed into my eyes, and my anger gave me strength.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I try to suggest an effectual {{sense of the}} term culture.
