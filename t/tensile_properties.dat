2500|$|As {{competition}} in the wind market increases, companies are seeking ways to draw greater efficiency from their designs. One of the predominant ways wind turbines have gained performance is by increasing rotor diameters, and thus blade length. Retrofitting current turbines with larger blades mitigates the need and risks associated with a system-level redesign. By incorporating carbon fiber into parts of existing blade systems, manufacturers may increase {{the length of the}} blades without increasing their overall weight. For instance, the spar cap, a structural element of a turbine blade, commonly experiences high tensile loading, making it an ideal candidate to utilize the enhanced <b>tensile</b> <b>properties</b> of carbon fiber in comparison to glass fiber. Higher stiffness and lower density translates to thinner, lighter blades offering equivalent performance. [...] In a 10-MW turbine—which will become more common in offshore systems by 2021—blade lengths may reach over 100 m and weigh up to 50 metric tons when fabricated out of glass fiber. A switch to carbon fiber in the structural spar of the blade yields weight savings of 20 to 30 percent, or approximately 15 metric tons. [...] The compressive properties of carbon fiber do not differ significantly from those of glass fiber. [...] It is therefore economical to replace glass fiber components under compression with carbon fiber components. [...] Improving performance through weight reductions rather than increasing scale also has advantages in transportation. [...] The size of a wind turbine, its blades and tower, are all limited by the height and width clearances, and turning radius, of the route used to transport the components to the installation site. The scale of these pieces has in some cases forced the adoption of Schnabel trailers.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} paper is to investigate the <b>tensile</b> <b>property</b> of laminated resin composites reinforced by carbon fiber plain woven fabric at relatively high temperature. For this purpose, the tensile tests of laminated resin composites are carried out at room temperature(20 °C) and high temperature(150 °C and 180 °C). The effect rules of different temperature on the <b>tensile</b> <b>property</b> of these composites are discussed. The reasons for the variations of <b>tensile</b> <b>property</b> of these composites at different temperature are also analyzed. At 150 °C and 180 °C, the tensile strength of laminated composite decreased by 13. 3 % and 34. 42 % respectively, compared with that at room temperature, which shows that the tensile strength of resin laminated composites is sensitive at high temperature. The reason of the tensile strength of resin laminated composites declined at high temperature is that resin has been damaged and can not transfer tensile load, which makes resin and fiber can not bear the tensile load together at high temperature. The research results will provide a basic reference for the application of plain woven fabric reinforced resin laminated composites at room temperature to 180 °C...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer) cable can be {{advantageously}} used {{to overcome}} the problem of corrosion encountered in conventional PS steel strands. Since CFRP cable presents weakness against lateral pressure and stress concentration, {{the application of the}} anchorage system adopted for conventional PS steel strand is likely to fail in providing reliable resistance because of premature failure. Therefore, appropriate anchorage device needs to be developed for the anchoring of CFRP cable. The typical types of anchoring device for CFRP cable are wedge-type, bond-type and grip-type anchorages. Most of anchors are bond-type to measure the <b>tensile</b> <b>property</b> of CFRP cables. Generally CFRP materials like reinforcements, tendons, and cables have surface treatments to improve bond strength as sand coating, deformed shapes, fabricated covers and so on. In case of CFRP cable without surface treatment, its bond strength is much lower than CFRP cable with surface treatments. Accordingly, bond-type anchor may be long and <b>tensile</b> <b>property</b> of CFRP cable may be misestimated. In this study, tests for <b>tensile</b> <b>property</b> of CFRP cable without surface treatment have been performed.
