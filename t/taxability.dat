5|$|Arguments {{about the}} <b>taxability</b> of {{compensation}} for personal services, whether called wages, salary, {{or some other}} term, may be either constitutional arguments as in United States v. Connor (see below) or statutory arguments as in Cheek v. United States, depending {{on the details of}} the argument. For purposes of presentation, these arguments are summarized here rather than in the article Tax protester statutory arguments. The rest of this section explains these arguments in more detail.|$|E
5|$|Regarding the <b>taxability</b> {{of income}} in {{connection}} with events or activities not involving a government privilege or franchise, the United States Supreme Court stated in United States v. Sullivan that gains from illegal traffic in liquor {{are subject to the}} Federal income tax. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Rutkin v. United States that the receipt of money obtained by extortion is taxable as income to the wrongdoer. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in James v. United States that the receipt of money obtained through embezzlement is taxable as income to the wrongdoer, even though the wrongdoer is required to return the money to its owner.|$|E
500|$|Some tax protesters cite a case called Conner v. United States, with a {{quotation}} that [...] "Congress has taxed income, not compensation" [...] for {{the argument that}} wages are not taxable. This was the case cited unsuccessfully by LaKerra Sumter before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims {{in the case of}} Sumter v. United States. The Conner case involved the <b>taxability</b> of compensation paid by an insurance company to a policy holder whose house had burned down. The insurance company was reimbursing the homeowner for the costs of renting a place to stay after the home burned down [...] {{under the terms of the}} insurance policy. The insurance company was not paying [...] "wages". The court was not presented with, and did not decide, any issue involving the <b>taxability</b> of wages.|$|E
500|$|The Court in {{this case}} did not rule on any issue {{involving}} the <b>taxability</b> of labor or income from labor, or wages, salary or ordinary [...] "cash" [...] dividends [...] where the stockholder actually receives a check from the company, etc. Indeed, the terms [...] "wage" [...] and [...] "salary" [...] do {{not appear in the}} text of the decision in Eisner v. Macomber.|$|E
500|$|The Court in Merchants' Loan was {{specifically}} interpreting a 1916 statute imposing income taxes on individuals and estates (among {{other kinds of}} entities), and not the 1909 corporate tax statute. The taxpayer in Merchants' Loan was not a corporation but was the [...] "Estate of Arthur Ryerson, Deceased". The Court was not presented with (and did not decide) any issue involving the <b>taxability</b> of [...] "corporate profits" [...] or [...] "corporate gains" [...] or {{any other kind of}} income except the gain on the sale of the stock by the [...] "Estate of Arthur Ryerson, Deceased". The terms [...] "corporate profit" [...] and [...] "corporate gain" [...] are not found in the text of the Court’s decision in Merchants’ Loan. [...] In Merchants' Loan, the Supreme Court ruled that under the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the 1916 tax statute applicable at the time, a gain on a sale of stock by the estate of a deceased person is included in the income of that estate, and is therefore taxable to that estate for federal income tax purposes.|$|E

50|$|The Rabbi trust {{allows the}} {{deferment}} of compensation whether employment income or {{the purchase price}} of a business acquisition, {{and the absence of}} this would result in the <b>taxability</b> to the payee of the compensation not yet received by the payee.

50|$|Different onshore {{countries}} treat income {{arising from}} offshore funds in different ways. US citizens are generally subject to taxation on foreign earned investment income {{regardless of whether}} they live in the world and where the income is remitted to.

50|$|The {{administration}} of the royal lands (khalesajat) came under review, and the income derived from them was more closely supervised than before. Yield and productivity, not area, were established {{as the basis of}} tax assessment for other lands, and previously dead lands were brought under cultivation. These various measures for the encouragement of agriculture and industry also benefited the treasury by raising the level of national prosperity and hence <b>taxability.</b>|$|E

5000|$|This firm (at {{the time}} trading under {{the style of}} [...] "Messrs. Tattersall") has the {{distinction}} of setting a judicial precedent on the <b>taxability</b> of unclaimed balances (purchase moneys for horses that had {{been paid to the}} firm but which had gone unclaimed for substantial periods of time by the firm's clients). In Morley v Tattersall, the English Court of Appeal held that such sums were not to be treated as profits for the purposes of Income Tax.|$|E
50|$|A {{branch office}} is an outlet {{of a company}} or, more generally, an {{organization}} that - unlike a subsidiary - does not constitute a separate legal entity, while being physically separated from the organization's main office. Branching is particularly widespread in banking and other financial institutions, where the products' complexity requires local offices to act more like an agency than as a separate company. A branch structure exposes the owning company to full <b>taxability</b> and legal liability {{in regard to the}} branch office's operations.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} attempts to define income occurred {{in the case of}} Eisner v. Macomber, in which the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the <b>taxability</b> of a proportionate stock dividend (as opposed to a monetary or cash dividend on stock). This case provided the Court with a forum to try to interpret exactly what Congress intended to include in the sparse Section 22 definition of “income.” This {{was not the first time}} the Court had addressed the issue: the case had been argued in the previous term of the Court, and was being reargued with additional oral and written briefs.|$|E
50|$|There are {{currently}} over 14,000 tax jurisdictions in the U.S. {{and many of}} these jurisdictions have varying <b>taxability</b> on services. Given the volume of jurisdictions, the source of the sale may also need to be examined, in order to appropriately apply and remit the tax. For instance, states may require use tax based upon the location in which the service was provided, while other states may require use tax based upon the location of “benefit”. In traditional repair and maintenance type services these locations will typically be one in the same, however with complex technology transactions these locations are often different.|$|E
5000|$|The {{motor fuel}} excise tax is {{collected}} from a [...] "distributor" [...] - usually a wholesaler - {{even though the}} ultimate burden to pay the tax may be on a retailer or purchaser. [...] There is a presumption of <b>taxability,</b> so taxing authorities can allow reasonably for only a 1% loss for [...] "evaporation and spillage" [...] in long-term storage tanks. [...] A bus company, such as Greyhound bus, is considered a distributor {{for the purposes of}} the motor fuel excise tax. [...] A retailer is liable for the amount of tax due bought from a supplier from New Jersey.|$|E

5000|$|The court {{concluded}} that the radio show giveaway prize constituted a nontaxable gift {{since there was no}} expectation or {{effort on the part of}} the recipient, no subsequent obligation on her part to perform any services or to make any commercial endorsement, no wager made by the recipient, and since the prize transferor had denominated the payment as an [...] "outright cash gift." [...] 37 This case became known as the [...] "Pot O'Gold" [...] case. The criteria set forth by the court, including the donor's subjective intention and the lack of effort or obligation on the part of the recipient, became standards by which subsequent courts analyzed the <b>taxability</b> of prizes and awards. 38 ...|$|E
50|$|The type {{of project}} or {{projects}} that are funded by a bond affects the <b>taxability</b> of income received on the bonds. Interest earnings on bonds that fund projects that are constructed for the public good are generally exempt from federal income taxes, while interest earnings on bonds issued to fund projects partly or wholly benefiting only private parties, {{sometimes referred to as}} private activity bonds or PABs, may be subject to federal income tax. However, qualified private activity bonds, whether issued by a governmental unit or private entity, are exempt from federal taxes because the bonds are financing services or facilities that, while meeting the private activity tests, are needed by a government. See a list of those projects in Section 141 of the IRS Code.|$|E
50|$|The <b>taxability</b> of {{alcoholic}} beverages is slightly complicated. In Pennsylvania, alcohol is sold to businesses and consumers through the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (PLCB). The PLCB always charges sales tax {{directly to the}} purchasing entity. Therefore, if a consumer purchases alcohol in PLCB stores, the sales tax is assessed {{at the point of}} purchase, but if a consumer purchases alcohol at a licensed business (such as a bar or restaurant), the sales tax is not applied because it had already been paid when the business purchased the alcohol from the PLCB. The PLCB charges an additional 18% levy on liquor and wine, but this tax is always included in the price regardless of the purchasing location. Beer is subject to an excise of $0.08 per gallon.|$|E
5000|$|EMMA's {{disclosure}} collection {{operates in}} coordination with the MSRB's investor protection rules mandating that securities firms and banks selling municipal securities to customers provide them with complete disclosure of all important information about the investment. EMMA also is the central information utility through which municipal securities disclosures mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) through its Rule 15c2-12 are made freely available to the general public. [...] The EMMA continuing disclosure service provides access to audited financial statements, default notices, <b>taxability</b> notices, notices of rating changes, and approximately 30 additional categories of financial and other updates relating to municipal securities. [...] The MSRB and SEC continue to work toward expanding the types and timeliness of disclosures available through EMMA.|$|E
50|$|Key {{information}} about new issues of municipal bonds (including, among other things, the security pledged for repayment of the bonds, {{the terms of}} payment of interest and principal of the bonds, the tax-exempt status of the bonds, and material financial and operating {{information about}} the issuer of the bonds) typically {{is found in the}} issuer's official statement. Official statements generally are available at no charge from the Electronic Municipal Market Access system (EMMA) at http://emma.msrb.org operated by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB). For most municipal bonds issued in recent years, the issuer is also obligated to provide continuing disclosure to the marketplace, including annual financial information and notices of the occurrence of certain material events (including notices of defaults, rating downgrades, events of <b>taxability,</b> etc.). Continuing disclosures is available for free from the EMMA continuing disclosure service.|$|E
5000|$|Non-tax {{qualified}} (NTQ) {{was formerly}} called traditional long-term care insurance. It often includes a [...] "trigger" [...] called a [...] "medical necessity" [...] trigger. This {{means that the}} patient's own doctor, or that doctor in conjunction with someone from the insurance company, can state that the patient needs care for any medical reason and the policy will pay. NTQ policies include walking as an activity of daily living and usually only require the inability to perform 1 or more activity of daily living. The Treasury Department has not clarified the status of benefits received under a non-qualified long-term care insurance plan. Therefore, the <b>taxability</b> of these benefits is open to further interpretation. This means {{that it is possible}} that individuals who receive benefits under a non-qualified long-term care insurance policy risk facing a large tax bill for these benefits.|$|E
