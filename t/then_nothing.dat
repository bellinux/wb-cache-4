Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by Carl Gyllenborg (in 1744–1745), crown-prince Adolf Fredrik (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerström (in 1748 and 1750) and Jonas Alströmer (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalised and the steady flow of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection rather than to the museum. Linnaeus felt his work was reflecting the harmony of nature and he said in 1754 'the earth is <b>then</b> <b>nothing</b> else but a museum of the all-wise creator's masterpieces, divided into three chambers'. He had turned his own estate into a microcosm of that 'world museum'.|$|E

In his review of the film, Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, [...] "If this film doesn't make an international star of Mr. Gibson, <b>then</b> <b>nothing</b> will. He possesses both the necessary talent and the screen presence." [...] According to John Hiscock of The Daily Telegraph, the film did, indeed, establish Gibson as an international talent.|$|E

[...] The most recent television advertising campaign for Tango at the time was a series of advertisements featuring the slogan [...] "the whole fruit" [...] that had aired from 1987–1991. These advertisements featured musical soundtracks throughout and lacked the surreal humour that would later dominate the soft drink's advertising from Orange Man onwards.|$|E

[...] Metacritic reports a 65 out of 100 rating based on 9 critics, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars and praised Hunt's performance: [...] "Billy Kwan is played, astonishingly, by a woman—Linda Hunt, a New York stage actress who enters the role so fully that it never occurs to us that she is not a man. This is what great acting is, a magical transformation of one person into another". In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby praised Gibson's performance: [...] "If this film doesn't make an international star of Mr. Gibson (Gallipoli, The Road Warrior), <b>then</b> <b>nothing</b> will. He possesses both the necessary talent and the screen presence".|$|E
2500|$|The {{statement}} [...] "God is dead", {{occurring in}} several of Nietzsche's works (notably in The Gay Science), {{has become one of}} his best-known remarks. On the basis of it, most commentators regard Nietzsche as an atheist; others (such as Kaufmann) suggest that this statement reflects a more subtle understanding of divinity. Recent developments in modern science and the increasing secularization of European society had effectively 'killed' the Abrahamic God, who had served as the basis for meaning and value in the West for more than a thousand years. The death of God may lead beyond bare perspectivism to outright nihilism, the belief that nothing has any inherent importance and that life lacks purpose. Here he states that the Christian moral doctrine provides people with intrinsic value, belief in God (which justifies the evil in the world) and a basis for objective knowledge. In this sense, in constructing a world where objective knowledge is possible, Christianity is an antidote to a primal form of nihilism—the despair of meaninglessness. As Heidegger put the problem, [...] "If God as the suprasensory ground and goal of all reality is dead, if the suprasensory world of the ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory and above it its vitalizing and upbuilding power, <b>then</b> <b>nothing</b> more remains to which man can cling and by which he can orient himself." ...|$|E
