5|$|In China, the {{art form}} has been known by many other names in {{different}} times and places. The earliest Chinese name {{was a combination of}} the Xipi and Erhuang melodies, and was called Pi Huang. As it increased in popularity, its name became Jingju or Jingxi, which reflected its start in the capital city, Jing, and the form of the performance, Xi. From 1927 to 1949, Beijing was known as Beiping, and Peking opera was known as Pingxi or Pingju (Traditional 平劇, Simplified 平剧) to reflect this change. Finally, with the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the name of the capital city was reverted to Beijing, and the formal name of Beijing theatre in Mainland China was established as Jingju. The Taiwanese name for this type of opera, Guoju, national <b>theatre</b> <b>style,</b> reflects disputes over the true seat of the Chinese government.|$|E

25|$|Jean-Baptiste Lully, an Italian violinist, dancer, choreographer, and composer, {{who joined}} the court of Louis XIV in 1652, played a {{significant}} role in establishing the general direction ballet would follow for the next century. Supported and admired by King Louis XIV, Lully often cast the king in his ballets. The title of Sun King for the French monarch, originated in Louis XIV's role in Lully's Ballet de la Nuit (1653). The fourteen-year-old Louis XIV danced five roles in this 12-hour ballet. This Ballet was lavish and featured a scene where a set piece of a house was burned down, included witches, werewolves, gypsies, shepherds, thieves, and the goddesses Venus and Diana. Lully's main contribution to ballet were his nuanced compositions. His understanding of movement and dance allowed him to compose specifically for ballet, with musical phrasings that complemented physical movements. Lully also collaborated with the French playwright Molière. Together, they took an Italian <b>theatre</b> <b>style,</b> the commedia dell'arte, and adapted it into their work for a French audience, creating the comédie-ballet. Among their greatest productions, with Beauchamp as the choreographer, was Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme (1670).|$|E
500|$|Peking opera {{was born}} when the 'Four Great Anhui Troupes' brought Anhui opera, {{or what is}} now called Huiju, in 1790 to Beijing, for the eightieth {{birthday}} of the Qianlong Emperor on 25 September. It was originally staged for the court and only made available to the public later. In 1828, several famous Hubei troupes arrived in Beijing and performed jointly with Anhui troupes. The combination gradually formed Peking opera's melodies. Peking opera is generally regarded as having fully formed by 1845. Although it is called Peking opera (Beijing <b>theatre</b> <b>style),</b> its origins are in the southern Anhui and eastern Hubei, which share the same dialect of Xiajiang Mandarin (Lower Yangtze Mandarin). Peking opera's two main melodies, Xipi and Erhuang, were derived from Han Opera [...] after about 1750. The tune of Peking opera is extremely similar to that of Han opera, therefore Han opera is widely known as the Mother of Peking opera. Xipi literally means 'Skin Puppet Show', referring to the puppet show that originated in Shaanxi province. Chinese puppet shows always involve singing. [...] Much dialogue is also carried out in an archaic form of Mandarin Chinese, in which the Zhongyuan Mandarin dialects of Henan and Shaanxi are closest. This form of Mandarin is recorded in the book Zhongyuan Yinyun. It also absorbed music from other operas and local Zhili musical art forms. Some scholars believe that the Xipi musical form was derived from the historic Qinqiang, while many conventions of staging, performance elements, and aesthetic principles were retained from Kunqu, the form that preceded it as court art.|$|E

50|$|Appeasing senior {{citizens}} by performing gigs {{at the nursing}} home is another way to gain popularity. Otherwise, they will criticize the player's music or <b>theatre</b> <b>styles</b> without an end. After gaining the respect of the elderly, the mad faces eventually turn into frowns (and eventually smiles). Television appearances {{come in the form of}} talent shows, televised concerts, and several other surprises. The eventual goal is to convert all stadiums and concert venues to the player's colors. In addition to popularity meters for the players, music styles have their own popularity meters. Smiles with the player's colors determine which music styles are best liked by the player's fans. This determine what music or <b>theatre</b> <b>styles</b> to play and which ones to avoid in certain concert venues.|$|R

2500|$|Although {{directors}} and choreographers {{have had a}} major influence on musical <b>theatre</b> <b>style</b> since at least the 19th century, [...] George Abbott and his collaborators and successors took a central role in integrating movement and dance fully into musical theatre productions in the Golden Age. [...] Abbott introduced ballet as a story-telling device in On Your Toes in 1936, which was followed by Agnes DeMille's ballet and choreography in Oklahoma!. [...] After Abbott collaborated with Jerome Robbins in On the Town and other shows, Robbins combined the roles of director and choreographer, emphasizing the story-telling power of dance in West Side Story, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1962) and Fiddler on the Roof (1964). Bob Fosse choreographed for Abbott in The Pajama Game (1956) and Damn Yankees (1957), injecting playful sexuality into those hits. [...] He was later the director-choreographer for Sweet Charity (1968), Pippin (1972) and Chicago (1975). [...] Other notable director-choreographers have included Gower Champion, Tommy Tune, Michael Bennett, Gillian Lynne and Susan Stroman. [...] Prominent directors have included Hal Prince, who also got his start with Abbott, and Trevor Nunn.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, musicals {{took over}} the London stage in the Gay Nineties, led by {{producer}} George Edwardes, who perceived that audiences wanted a new alternative to the Savoy-style comic operas and their intellectual, political, absurdist satire. He experimented with a modern-dress, family-friendly musical <b>theatre</b> <b>style,</b> with breezy, popular songs, snappy, romantic banter, and stylish spectacle at the Gaiety and his other theatres. These drew on the traditions of comic opera and used elements of burlesque and of the Harrigan and Hart pieces. He replaced the bawdy women of burlesque with his [...] "respectable" [...] corps of Gaiety Girls to complete the musical and visual fun. The success {{of the first of}} these, In Town (1892) and A Gaiety Girl (1893) set the style for the next three decades. The plots were generally light, romantic [...] "poor maiden loves aristocrat and wins him against all odds" [...] shows, with music by Ivan Caryll, Sidney Jones and Lionel Monckton. These shows were immediately widely copied in America, and the Edwardian musical comedy swept away the earlier musical forms of comic opera and operetta. The Geisha (1896) {{was one of the most}} successful in the 1890s, running for more than two years and achieving great international success.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{commonly}} agreed that restoration comedy has origins in Molière’s theories of comedy, but differs in intention and tone.
