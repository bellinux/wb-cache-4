2500|$|Early in his run, Backlund and Peter Maivia {{formed a}} {{successful}} tag team and challenged for the WWWF World Tag Team Championship, then held by The Yukon Lumberjacks. During a television taping in October 1978, Maivia turned on and attacked him and Skaaland. In the immediate aftermath, fans {{for the first}} time got to see another side of Backlund's personality: that of a raving, ranting maniac when angered or pushed hard enough; in the post-match interview, Backlund screamed to interviewer Vince McMahon {{that he was going to}} [...] "kill <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bitch!" [...] Backlund eventually won a series of matches against Maivia, including a steel cage match in January 1979 at Madison Square Garden.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, Rich {{released}} Pictures and Paintings, a jazzy {{album that}} {{was produced by}} journalist Peter Guralnick. This album was released via Sire Records. Pictures and Paintings received positive critical reviews and restored Rich's reputation as a musician, {{but it was his}} last album. In 2016, a tribute album entitled Feel Like Going Home: The Songs of Charlie Rich was released by Memphis International Records. [...] Tom Waits, who was an opening act for Rich in the 1970s, mentions him in the song [...] "Putnam County" [...] from his album Nighthawks at the Diner with the lyric: [...] "The radio's spitting out Charlie Rich... He sure can sing, <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bitch." ...|$|E

[...] As the Ideal-X left the Port of Newark, Freddy Fields, a top official of the International Longshoremen's Association, was asked {{what he thought of}} the newly fitted container ship.

2500|$|The early Heinlein biographer {{and critic}} Alexei Panshin, in his 1968 {{biography}} Heinlein in Dimension, {{took note of}} a controversial theme: [...] "The romantic situation in this story is a very interesting, very odd one: it {{is nothing less than}} a mutual sexual interest between an engineer of thirty and a girl of twelve ('adorable' is Heinlein's word for her), that culminates in marriage after some hop-scotching around in time to adjust their ages a bit." [...] The novel [...] "worried and bothered" [...] John W. Campbell, who said [...] "Bob can write a better story, with one hand tied behind him, than most people in the field can do with both hands. But Jesus, I wish <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gun would take that other hand out of his pocket." ...|$|E
2500|$|Audie Murphy, Hollywood actor. Murphy {{became the}} most {{decorated}} United States combat soldier in United States military history. He received the Medal of Honor, the U.S. military's highest award for valor, along with 32 additional U.S. medals. He served with CompanyB, 1stBattalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division. Major General John P. Lucas {{is reported to have}} once visited the set of one of Murphy's films and, while he greeted actors and crew, was forced to salute Murphy – Murphy had the Medal of Honor and Lucas did not – and then had his handshake refused by Murphy, who instead returned the salute and then simply walked away. [...] Murphy later commented that [...] "...too damn many good men died at Anzio and Nettuno because of <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bitch. I'm damned if I'll shake hands with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{election}} of Marxist candidate Salvador Allende as President of Chile in September 1970 led Nixon to order that Allende {{not be allowed}} to take office. Edward Korry, US Ambassador to Chile, told Nixon that he saw no alternative to Allende. According to the ambassador, Nixon said, [...] "That son of a bitch, that son a bitch...Not you, Mr. Ambassador. It's <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bitch Allende. We're going to smash him." [...] Nixon pursued a vigorous campaign of covert resistance to Allende, intended to first prevent Allende from taking office, called Track I, and then when that failed, to provide a [...] "military solution", called Track II. As part of Track II, CIA operatives approached senior Chilean military leaders, using false flag operatives, and encouraged a coup d'état, providing both finances ($50,000) and weapons (submachine guns). With US encouragement, coup plotters first assassinated Army leader, General René Schneider, as he opposed military interference in the political process.|$|E

2500|$|During the Myitkyina siege, {{which took}} place {{during the height of the}} monsoon season, Marauders' second-in-command, Col. Hunter, as well as the unit's regimental and {{battalion}} level surgeons, had urgently recommended that the entire 5307th be relieved of duty and returned to rear areas for rest and recovery. By this time, most of the men had fevers and continual dysentery, forcing the men to cut the seats out of their uniform trousers in order to fire their weapons and relieve themselves simultaneously. Stilwell rejected the evacuation recommendation, though he did make a frontline inspection of the Myitkyina lines. Afterwards, he ordered all medical staff to stop returning combat troops suffering from disease or illness, and instead return them to combat status, using medications to keep down fevers. The feelings of many Marauders towards General Stilwell at that time were summed up by one soldier, who stated, [...] "I had him [...] in my sights. I coulda' squeezed one off and no one woulda' known it wasn't a Jap who got <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bitch." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pierpont {{writes that}} John Garfield was first {{choice for the}} role, but [...] "made {{impossible}} demands." [...] It was Kazan's decision {{to fall back on}} the far less experienced (and technically too young for the role) Brando. In a letter dated August 29, 1947, Williams confided to his agent Audrey Wood: [...] "It had not occurred to me before what an excellent value would come through casting a very young actor in this part. It humanizes the character of Stanley in that it becomes the brutality and callousness of youth rather than a vicious old man... A new value came out of Brando's reading which was by far the best reading I have ever heard." [...] Brando based his portrayal of Kowalski on the boxer Rocky Graziano, whom he had studied at a local gymnasium. Graziano did not know who Brando was, but attended the production with tickets provided by the young man. He said, [...] "The curtain went up and on the stage is <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bitch from the gym, and he's playing me." ...|$|E

Nevertheless, he had made up his mind to show them he could get a light, if he were to die for it.|$|E

At the gate you will find one of our spies, who will conduct you to the cavern in which he lies concealed. Of course I could have him seized at once if I chose, but I have a deeper game to play, and want to make Ravoninohitriniony an unwitting instrument. It seems that more {{of the people in the}} palace are Christians than I knew of. It has come to my ears that some of these intend going stealthily to the cave to meet Ravoninohitriniony, for they are fond of this son of a wild-boar, and {{probably}} hope to have news by him of their banished kindred." ...|$|E
60|$|Then they crept nearer, crept {{on their}} hands and knees, till they were within ten paces of where I sat among the indunas near to the king. The indunas looked on each other and grew grey with fear; and for me, my father, my knees were {{loosened}} and my marrow turned to water in my bones. For I knew well who was <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stranger of whom they spoke. It was I, my father, I who was about to be smelt out; and if I was smelt out I should be killed with all my house, for the king's oath would scarcely avail me against the witch-doctors. I looked at the fierce faces of the Isanusis before me, as they crept, crept like snakes. I glanced behind and saw the slayers grasping their kerries for the deed of death, and I say I felt like one for whom the bitterness is overpast. Then I remembered the words which the king and I had whispered together of the cause for which this Ingomboco was set, and hope crept back to me like the first gleam of the dawn upon a stormy night. Still I did not hope overmuch, for it well might happen that the king had but set a trap to catch me.|$|E
