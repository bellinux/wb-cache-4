To simulate the fabrication process and to find solution to the performance questions, A viscoelastic rheological model of fused biconical taper process is presented by using generalized Maxwell model to simulate the viscoelastic characteristic of fused fiberglass, and the rheological numerical analysis under the non-isothermal condition is carried out with ANSYS software.

Yttria-stabilized tetragonal {{zirconia}} polycrystal (Y-TZP) {{ceramic material}} {{has been reported}} to possess remarkably high flexural strength; however, after sintering zirconium dioxide (ZrO 2) frameworks and fixed partial dentures, some may not fit properly when trying them on their master cast. PURPOSE. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate joining fully sintered YTZ-P by various methods including adhesive cements or fusion with intervening materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS. 216 specimens were used in this study; bars were fabricated from Vita In-Ceram YZ blocks and three bars were joined using dental cements; RelyX Unicem 2 Clicker and Multilink Automix, or fusing them with VM 9, Infusion Glass, Boron Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, LUDOX, Colloidal Zirconia and Mullite Zirconia. The load to failure in Newtons was determined using a 3 -point bending test. RESULTS. Sandblasted bars for RelyX (64. 38 N, RelyX-A-Sb) and Multilink (48. 58 N, M-Sb) wasn’t significantly higher compared to as-sintered groups (45. 87 N, RelyX-A) and (34. 69 N, M-A). Coating the bars with Monobond-Plus had a significantly higher load to failure 123. 22 N, RelyX-A-MP and 136. 06 N, M-MP compared to as-sintered and sandblasted groups. VM 9 at an end firing temperature (EFT) of 1200 °C was significantly higher (228. 97 N, V- 5) compared to lower <b>fusing</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Glass at an end firing temperature of 1200 °C was significantly higher (460. 32 N, G- 6) compared to lower <b>fusing</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Frit at an end firing temperature of 1200 °C was significantly higher (214. 52 N, F- 6) compared to lower <b>fusing</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Optical microscopy showed that Glass group G- 6 (1200 °C, EFT) had a thickness range from. 09 to 0. 03 mm while for Glass-A (1050 °C, EFT) it was 0. 5 mm. CONCLUSIONS. Within the limitations of this study, we concluded that sandblasted bars didn’t significantly increase the means load to failure values compared to as-sintered groups.

A research on the effect of burn on the six ton medium carbon steel shaft for making a roller of cold rolled steel sheet produced at one of the metals industry was carried out. The shaft was cast using sand casting by pouring through riser/feeding head step by step (with time interval of pouring). As it was required to use foam casting method for better surface finish and dimensional accuracy of the cast, the pattern was prepared from polystyrene and embedded by silica sand. Physical observations, photographic analysis, visual inspection, measurement of depth of penetration and fish bone diagram were used as method of results analysis. The shaft produced has strongly affected by sand sintering (burn on/metal penetration). Many reasons may be the case for these defects, however analysis results showed that the use of poorly designed gating system led to turbulence flow, uncontrollable high <b>temperature</b> <b>fused</b> the silica sand and liquid polystyrene penetrated the poorly reclaimed and rammed sand mold as a result of which eroded sand has penetrated the liquid metal deeply and reacted with it, consequently after solidification and finishing the required 240 mm diameter of the shaft has reduced un evenly to 133 mm minimum and 229 mm maximum mm that end in the rejection of the shaft from the product since it is below the required standard for the designed application.

Also, certain frits can be added to high-tech ceramics: such frits are made by milling zinc oxide (ZnO) and boric acid (H3BO3) with zirconium (Zr) beads, then heating this mixture to 1100 °C, quenching it, and grinding it. This frit is then added to a lithium titanate (Li2TiO3) ceramic powder, which enables the ceramic to sinter at a lower temperature while still keeping its “microwave dielectric properties." [...] Sintering is the high <b>temperature</b> <b>fusing</b> together of powder to form a solid, usually porous, material. In laboratory and industrial chemical process equipment, the term frit denotes a filter made by the sintering-together of glass particles to produce a piece of known porosity referred to as fritted glass.

Gas phase Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) over a fixed-bed of the prepared catalyst/FAZ support was identified as an appropriate process for evaluation, by comparison with commercial catalyst supports (silica, alumina, and 13 X). Fly ash, obtained from the Wabash River Generating Station, was first characterized using XRD, SEM/EDS, particle size, and nitrogen sorption techniques. Then, a parametric study of a two-step alkali fusion/hydrothermal treatment process for converting fly ash to zeolite frameworks was performed by varying the alkali fusion agent, agent:flyash ratio, fusion <b>temperature,</b> <b>fused</b> ash/water solution, aging time, and crystallization time. The optimal conditions for each were determined to be NaOH, 1. 4 g NaOH: 1 g fly ash, 550 °C, 200 g/L, 12 hours, and 48 hours. This robust process {{was applied to the}} fly ash to obtain a faujasitic zeolite structure with increased crystallinity (40 %) and surface area (434 m 2 /g). Following the modification of fly ash to FAZ, ion exchange of H+ for Na+ and cobalt incipient wetness impregnation were used to prepare a FTS catalyst. FTS was performed on the catalysts at 250 - 300 °C, 300 psi, and with a syngas ratio H 2 :CO = 2. The HFAZ catalyst support loaded with 11 wt% cobalt resulted in a 75 % carbon selectivity for C 5 - C 18 hydrocarbons, while methane and carbon dioxide were limited to 13 and 1 %, respectively. Catalyst characterization was performed by XRD, N 2 sorption, TPR, and oxygen pulse titration to provide insight to the behavior of each catalyst. Overall, the HFAZ compared well with silica and 13 X supports, and far exceeded the performance of the alumina support under the tested conditions.
