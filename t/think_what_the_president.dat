60|$|I said I {{had been}} trying to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> tray had to do with it.|$|R
60|$|I dread to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> result {{might have}} been had his answer been other than it was.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> fellow's doing here, anyhow," [...] Carton remarked discontentedly. [...] "A few {{generations ago}} {{we should have}} hung him." ...|$|R
6000|$|The captain {{leaned back}} in his chair and {{regarded}} him thoughtfully. [...] "I can't <b>think</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> matter with you, Jem," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Hendrie, {{will you}} {{be good enough to}} play? The king of clubs to beat. I can't <b>think</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> matter with you to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A feebler sort of beast I never saw. I can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> {{world is}} coming to. Scraggy, weedy legs.... Wonder how they keep warm in winter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't nonsense. You are a {{minister}} {{and it would}} ruin you to marry a girl like me. <b>Think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Rexton people would say of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{really must}} speak to him, Archdeacon. Only <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Thornes will say if they hear that their parish clergyman spends his whole time philandering with this woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fie,' said she; 'what {{a ridiculous}} thing to ask anyone to do; just <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> {{neighbours}} {{would say if}} they saw me. They would think I had taken leave of my senses.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't <b>think</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> use of Harry's coming home," [...] Gertrude {{was heard}} saying to Richard. [...] "It is very disagreeable;" [...] whereat Mary relapsed into a giggle, and Ethel felt frantic.|$|R
60|$|The poor chap {{gave one}} of those mirthless laughs. He was looking anxious and worried, {{like a man who}} has done the murder all right but can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> deuce to do with the body.|$|R
6000|$|... (3.) Fearful cogitations haunt him, misgivings, direful apprehensions of God, terrify him. Now he hath time to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> loss {{of heaven}} will be, and <b>what</b> <b>the</b> torments of hell will be: now he looks no way {{but he is}} frighted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{of course}} I don't mean cryin' {{out like a}} baby," [...] said Hetty, looking down with a modest smile, [...] "but I saw tears in his eyes, and {{sometimes}} they got on his cheeks. I can't <b>think</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> matter with him." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "When {{designing}} a flag {{remember that it}} will fly {{in the wind and}} is not just a rectangular design on paper - so <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> flag will look like when flying in a brisk breeze and when hanging down on a still day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It only {{wants the}} low solemn surge and ripple of the tide, and its dash on the rocks,' said Guy. 'If {{ever there was}} music, it is there; but it makes one <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> ear must be that can take {{in the whole of}} those harmonics.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{learn the}} high-priest's mind and <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> high-priest thinks," [...] I {{answered}} darkly, though {{in my heart}} I was terribly afraid for Merapi, and, to speak truth, for myself also, because of the doubts which arose in me {{and would not be}} quenched.|$|R
5000|$|<b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> Will Say and Do!! Barrytown, NY: Station Hill Press (1984) [...]|$|R
6000|$|... "Her {{heart has}} always been there, and her father is in treaty for a farm for him, so I fear there is little hope of keeping them. I can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> parish will do without her. By the bye, how does Joe Reynolds get on with his drawings?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes?" [...] She {{raised her}} head. [...] "It was wrong {{of me to}} say that. They are really fond of me. It's {{the only thing that}} makes life worth living--when they're fond of you, isn't it? I daren't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> place would be without them. By the way, is it beautiful?" ...|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{then spent}} some time in fruitless {{attempts}} to make some lighted birch bark go down into the stump, and burn there. He succeeded very well in getting pieces completely on fire; but, after they were dropped into the hole, they would not burn. Rollo could not <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> reason could be.|$|R
60|$|Mary did kiss him, {{and he did}} go. But as she {{was still}} {{lingering}} in the room, putting away a book, or a reel of thread, and then sitting down to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> morrow would bring forth, the doctor again {{came into the room}} in his dressing-gown, and with the slippers on.|$|R
5000|$|... "Letter from North Haven, or <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> Should Do Next", in Political Quarterly, 82, 1, Jan-Mar 2011 ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay!' said Lord Martindale, so much {{absorbed in}} his son as to forget his daughter's {{interest}} in Percival Fotheringham. 'He says Arthur's cough did not seem so painful as when he saw him before, and that he even spoke several times. I am frightened to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> risk has been of letting him in.' ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>President</b> {{proposes a}} {{national}} budget to Congress, {{which has the}} final say over the document, but which rarely appropriates more than <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> requests.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But what I say is, Mr Clennam,' {{the good}} woman went on, 'there's always {{something}} to be thankful for, as I am sure you will yourself admit. Speaking in this room, it's not hard to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> present something is. It's a thing to be thankful for, indeed, that Miss Dorrit is not here to know it.' ...|$|R
60|$|To <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> has above stated I {{will only}} add {{one or two}} points that may be {{satisfactory}} for you to know.|$|R
60|$|The wonder {{was that}} I {{did not kill}} him on the spot. I cannot <b>think</b> <b>what</b> possessed <b>the</b> man,--he must have known me better.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{consent to}} live with a wife with whom neither my wishes nor my word have the {{slightest}} effect. I may believe of her what I please, but, <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> world will believe! I cannot disgrace myself by living with a woman who persists in holding intercourse with a man whom the world speaks of as her lover." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am in dreadful {{uncertainty}} about her. She {{was very much}} agitated yesterday--and with her delicate health--I am afraid to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> turn <b>the</b> agitation may have taken.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Romania may be {{the turning}} point of the campaign. If the Germans fail there {{it will be the}} {{greatest}} disaster inflicted upon them. Afterwards it will only be a question of time. But should Germany succeed, I hesitate to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> effect will be on the fortunes of our campaign. â€¦ and yet no one seems to have thought it his particular duty to prepare a plan. Lloyd George ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't change, if I {{were the}} earl, with the queen's majesty," [...] Geoffrey said. [...] "Of {{course it is}} larger than Hedingham, but not so beautiful, and it is crowded in by the houses, and has not like our castle a fair lookout on all sides. Why, {{there can be no}} hunting or hawking near here, and I can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> nobles can find to do all day." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. BARTHWICK. Another Labour? I can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> {{on earth}} <b>the</b> country is about.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{mean the}} {{secretary}} was the daughter's husband all along, {{and he heard}} <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> said right there?" [...] Nelly panted, stopping outside Miggleton's, {{in the light from}} the oyster-filled window.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Much obliged," [...] he said. [...] "But I couldn't gather from Red Jacket exactly <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> said to Monsieur Genet, or to his American gentlemen after Monsieur Genet {{had ridden}} away." ...|$|R
