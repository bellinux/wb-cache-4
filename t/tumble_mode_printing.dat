The <b>tumble</b> <b>mode</b> is a peculiarity of weightshift controlled aircraft - that is flexwing microlights and hang-gliders. It is a departure from controlled flight leading to a nose-down pitch autorotation: pitch rates of 400 °/s are known.

40|$|When a coin {{falls in}} water, its {{trajectory}} {{is one of}} four types determined by its dimensionless moment of inertia I^∗ and Reynolds number Re: (A) steady; (B) fluttering; (C) chaotic; or (D) tumbling. The dynamics induced by the interaction of the water with the surface of the coin, however, makes the exact landing site difficult to predict a priori. Here, we describe a carefully designed experiment in which a coin is dropped repeatedly in water, so that we can determine the probability density functions (pdf) associated with the landing positions {{for each of the four}} trajectory types, all of which are radially symmetric about the center-drop line. In the case of the steady mode, the pdf is approximately Gaussian distributed, with variances that are small, indicating that the coin is most likely to land at the center, right below the point it is dropped from. For the other falling modes, the center is one of the least likely landing sites. Indeed, the pdf's of the fluttering, chaotic and <b>tumbling</b> <b>modes</b> are characterized by a "dip" around the center. For the <b>tumbling</b> <b>mode,</b> the pdf is a ring configuration about the center-line, with a ring width that depends on the dimensionless parameters I^∗ and Re and height from which the coin is dropped. For the chaotic mode, the pdf is generally a broadband distribution spread out radially symmetrically about the center-line. For the steady and fluttering modes, the coin never flips, so the coin lands with the same side up as was dropped. For the chaotic mode, the probability of heads or tails is close to 0. 5. In the case of the <b>tumbling</b> <b>mode,</b> the probability of heads or tails based on the height of the drop which determines whether the coin flips an even or odd number of times during descent...|$|R

We observed a continuous capsule rotation at low shear rates, denoted as <b>tumbling</b> <b>mode.</b> A swinging mode at elevated shear rates was characterized by oscillations of the inclination angle around positive values, superimposed by a tank-treading motion of the capsule membrane. The transition between these different modes occurred via an intermittent regime. It {{turned out that the}} capsule deformation greatly influenced the orientation dynamics. In several experiments, we also observed shear-induced membrane wrinkling processes...|$|R
40|$|The <b>tumble</b> <b>mode</b> is a {{pitching}} departure from controlled flight {{which leads to}} a pitch autorotation that is generally unrecoverable – resulting in vertical ground impact, usually preceded by in-flight breakup (the mechanism for which, surprisingly, can sometimes prevent loss of life). This was identified in work led by the British Microlight Aircraft Association beginning in 1997 as a response to a number of fatal accidents in Rogallo winged microlight aeroplanes, although the tumble is also known to occur to hang-gliders. This paper explains how this class of aeroplane is controlled, and how it has been found that they can enter the <b>tumble</b> <b>mode.</b> The mechanism by which the tumble can be entered is described. This has led to work showing how flight testing can be used to establish and demonstrate resistance to tumble entry – particularly important with increasing number of very high performance flexwings. These flight tests will be explained, together with the significance of the results. Recent accident investigation work has also shown a new mechanism of tumble entry, through partial failure of the A-frame structure and the pitch-trimmer mechanism. Also described is a possible relevance to well known historical accidents to flying wing aeroplanes – specifically the YB- 49 and dH- 108, and discovered data on the characteristics of the BKB- 1 flying wing glider; are also described...|$|R
40|$|The cost {{of private}} or {{recreational}} flying is high for most conventional aircraft types. During the last 25 years, however, an alternative has become {{available in the}} form of the microlight aircraft. It has a relatively low cost of ownership and has opened up flying to a greater audience. However, there have been a number of accidents, usually fatal, to this class of aircraft, which could not be explained through any conventional understanding. The reason for these accidents, which involve a departure from controlled flight followed by aircraft structural failure (generally including mechanical failure of the basebar, wingtips and leading edge), has become known as the `tumble’, owing to the basic motion of the aircraft. This paper analyses the <b>tumble</b> <b>mode,</b> from its initiation through to the steady rotation condition. History has shown that the <b>tumble</b> <b>mode</b> has always resulted in the destruction of an aircraft. In consequence, it is the authors’ opinion that consideration of the tumble during the approval of new designs should concentrate upon avoidance, since there is no identi®able recovery mechanism from the established mode without the use of an external safety device. A programme of research into this phenomenon was initiated in 1997. The peculiar nature of the tumble motion has required the aerodynamic modelling to address the effects of a high pitch rate, which has led to the introduction of unsteady aerodynamic effects. This paper sets out to describe and explain the mode, leading to a model that might reasonably be developed to produce relatively tumble resistant aircraft. Finally, the methods of possible entry are explained; it is intended that this information may be used in pilot training to ensure the avoidance ofthe tumble instability...|$|R
40|$|A quasi-rigid body {{initially}} spinning {{about its}} minor principal axis and experiencing energy dissipation will enter a <b>tumbling</b> <b>mode</b> and eventually reorient itself such that stable spin about its major principal axis is achieved. However, in this final state the body may be spinning {{in a positive}} or negative sense with respect to its major axis and aligned in a positive or negative sense with the inertially fixed angular momentum vector. This ambiguity can be controlled only through an active system. The associated dynamical formulations and simulations of uncontrolled reorientations are presented. Three control schemes are discussed and results offered for specific examples. These schemes include displacement of internal masses, spinning up of internal inertia, and reaction jets, {{all of which have}} demonstrated the ability to control spin ambiguity...|$|R

Results of the crew safety study indicate that the shuttle orbiter should be the primary vehicle for dealing with emergencies and one vehicle should be available for rapid emergency rescue.

By keeping the isolated condition of an observed single cell, we compared its growth and swimming property within a generation and over up to seven generations. It revealed that running speed decreased as cell length smoothly increased within each generation, whereas tumbling frequency fluctuated among generations. Also found was an extraordinary <b>tumbling</b> <b>mode</b> characterized by the prolonged duration of pausing in predivisional cells after cell constriction. The observed prolonged pausing may imply the coexistence of two distinct control systems in a predivisional cell, indicating that individuality of daughter cells emerges after a mother cell initiates constriction and before it gets physically separated into two new cell bodies...|$|R

40|$|Bacterial {{chemotaxis}} {{results from}} the ability of flagellated bacteria to control the frequency of switching between smooth-swimming and tumbling episodes in response to changes in concentration of extracellular substances. High levels of phosphorylated CheY protein are the intracellular signal for inducing the <b>tumbling</b> <b>mode</b> of swimming. The CheZ protein {{has been shown to}} control the level of phosphorylated CheY by regulating its rate of dephosphorylation. To identify functional domains in the CheZ protein, we made mutants by random mutagenesis of the cheZ gene and constructed a series of deletions. The map position and the in vivo and in vitro activity of the resulting gain- or loss-of-function mutant proteins define separate functional domains of the CheZ protein. Peritrichously flagellated bacteria are able to move towards high concentrations of attractant substances by alternating the rotational direction of their flagella (for reviews, see references 1, 6, 16, and 22 to 24). Counterclockwise rotation results in uni-directional swimming (smooth swimming), whereas changes in the swimming direction (tumbling) are achieved by intermit-tent clockwise rotation of the flagella.

40|$|The {{shear rate}} {{dependence}} of material {{functions such as}} shear viscosity (η) and the first normal stress difference (N 1) were given and interpreted earlier by Kiss and Porter. Their widely accepted work revealed the possibility of having a negative minimum of N 1 for polymeric liquid crystals. In this work, we disclose {{for the first time}} the evidence of two negative N 1 minima on a sheared cellulosic lyotropic system. The lower shear rate minimum is ascribed to the uncoiling of the cholesteric helix, as theoretically predicted earlier. Our findings contribute also to the understanding of the other minimum already reported in the literature and attributed to the nematic director <b>tumbling</b> <b>mode.</b> Moreover, the elastic change that the LC-HPC sample undergoes during the helix unwinding of the cholesteric structure is also by means of oscillatory measurements. This study is a contribution for the understanding of the structure-properties relationship linked with the complex rheological behavior of chiral nematic cellulose-based systems and may help to improve their further processing. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Escherichia coli (E. coli) {{bacteria}} govern their trajectories {{by switching}} between running and <b>tumbling</b> <b>modes</b> {{as a function}} of the nutrient concentration they experienced in the past. At short time one observes a drift of the bacterial population, while at long time one observes accumulation in high-nutrient regions. Recent work has viewed chemotaxis as a compromise between drift toward favorable regions and accumulation in favorable regions. A number of earlier studies assume that a bacterium resets its memory at tumbles - a fact not borne out by experiment - and make use of approximate coarse-grained descriptions. Here, we revisit the problem of chemotaxis without resorting to any memory resets. We find that when bacteria respond to the environment in a non-adaptive manner, chemotaxis is generally dominated by diffusion, whereas when bacteria respond in an adaptive manner, chemotaxis is dominated by a bias in the motion. In the adaptive case, favorable drift occurs together with favorable accumulation. We derive our results from detailed simulations and a variety of analytical arguments. In particular, we introduce a new coarse-grained description of chemotaxis as biased diffusion, and we discuss the way it departs from older coarse-grained descriptions...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a Landau-de Gennes {{model of a}} nematic liquid crystal in a model shear flow {{employing}} a range of analytical and numerical techniques. We use asymptotic methods and numerical bifurcation theory to provide a comprehensive description of the different in-plane modes that exist {{in terms of the}} temperature and imposed shear rate, as well as determining their stability to in-plane disturbances. We show that there are two physically distinct solution branches, one of which corresponds to an in-plane director (denoted IPN). The other branch corresponds to the director being aligned perpendicular to the shear plane, i. e. so-called log-rolling states. We find both tumbling and wagging time-dependent modes. The mode structure is organized by a Takens-Bogdanov point, at which a family of Hopf bifurcation points and a family of limit points coincide. At low strain rates tumbling occurs as a transition from the IPN branch. In addition, we show that at larger values of the strain rate the wagging modes emanate from a Hopf bifurcation on the IPN branch and evolve continuously into <b>tumbling</b> <b>modes.</b> Moreover, we show analytically that this boundary between tumbling and wagging corresponds to a state in which the distribution function is cylindrical in the shear plane. This provides confirmation of the tumbling-wagging transition mechanism observed by Tsuji and Rey in numerical calculations relating to a confined geometry...|$|R

Guidelines to {{mitigate}} the threat have been recommended, better prediction models are developed and an advanced observation of objects orbiting Earth is in progress. And still – without the implementation of active debris removal (ADR), the number of debris in space will exponentially increase. To support the ongoing research on ADR-missions, this paper presents the updated mission design of ADReS-A (Autonomous Debris Removal Satellite - #A) - one possible concept for the multiple active removal of large debris in Low Earth orbit, in this case especially of rocket bodies of the SL- 8 -type. ADReS-A as chaser satellite is supported by at least 5 de-orbit kits, allowing for the same number of targets to be removed. While ADReS-A is conceived for handling of the target, the kit’s task is the controlled re-entry of the designated rocket body.

The results indicated that the less skilled readers typically selected high-density text while the skilled reader selected low-density text.
