5|$|By January 1957, {{with the}} tests just months away, a <b>tentative</b> <b>schedule</b> had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as {{unnecessary}} otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next.

In December 1956, Cook had proposed another design, known as Green Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could fit into a Yellow Sun casing that could be used by the Blue Steel guided missile then under development; but it could not be made ready to reach Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would cost another £1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|Having {{decided on}} a {{location}} and date, there still remained the matter {{of what would be}} tested. John Challens, whose weapons electronics group would have to produce the assembly, wanted to know the configuration of Green Granite. Cook ruled that it would use a Red Beard Tom, and would fit inside a Blue Danube casing for dropping. The design was frozen in April 1956. There were two versions of Orange Herald, large and small. They had similar cores, but the large version contained more explosive. The designs were frozen in July. Green Bamboo was also nominally frozen, but tinkering with the design continued. On 3 September, Corner suggested that Green Granite could be made smaller by moving the Tom and Dick closer together. This design became known as Short Granite.

40|$|Tactical crew {{planning}} problem at Turkish State Railways (TCDD) involves finding the minimum crew capacity in a crew region required {{to operate a}} predetermined set of train duties assigned to the region by the headquarters. The problem is to be solved for each crew region by satisfying various rules and constraints associated {{with the requirements of}} the company. One of the most important constraints is the day-off requirement which makes the problem computationally intractable. In this study, we use a space-time network flow representation to solve the tactical capacity planning problem with day-off requirement. To solve the problem, we develop two solution approaches: the sequential approach and the integrated approach. In the sequential approach we mimic the current practice at TCDD and solve the problem in two stages. In the first stage, we solve a minimum flow problem over a space-time network by relaxing the day-off requirement. After obtaining the <b>tentative</b> <b>schedules</b> of crew members, we solve an assignment problem to fill-in the days-off in the <b>tentative</b> <b>schedules</b> by using additional substitute crew members. In the integrated approach, we solve a minimum flow problem with side constraints using a layered space-time network representation of the problem. We present the computational study on a real-life data set acquired from TCDD. We, then, study a higher level crew capacity planning problem. In this tactical-to-strategic level capacity planning problem, we minimize the total crew capacity of all regions by simultaneously considering multiple regions. We do this by re-assigning duties to different regions or allowing two neighboring crew regions share the train duties in different settings. For tactical-to-strategic capacity planning problem, we present the mathematical formulation of single-region and two-region models with various crew exchange policies. Given the large scale of the search space, we choose to employ a neighborhood search heuristic in order to solve the problem. The neighborhood search heuristic uses the minimum flow problem in the sequential approach as a subprocedure. We present the computational study again for the TCDD data set...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} idea to reduce {{the part of the}} {{downlink}} signaling traffic in wireless multiple access systems that contains scheduling information. The theoretical basis of the scheme is that the scheduling decisions made by the base station are correlated with the CSI reports from the mobiles. This correlation can be exploited by the source coding scheme that is used to compress the scheduling maps before they are sent to the mobiles. In the proposed scheme, this idea is implemented by letting the mobiles make <b>tentative</b> <b>scheduling</b> decisions themselves, and then letting the base station transmit "agreement maps" instead of raw scheduling maps to the mobiles. The agreement maps have lower entropy and they require less resources to be transmitted than the original scheduling maps do. The improvement can be substantial. © 2010 IEEE.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{need for}} low-power computing devices {{has led to}} the efforts to optimize power in all the components of a system. It is possible to achieve significant power optimization at the software level through instruction reordering during the compilation phase. In this thesis, we have designed and implemented a novel instruction scheduling technique, called FD-ISLP, aimed at reducing the software power consumption. In the proposed approach for instruction scheduling, we modify the force-directed scheduling technique used in high-level synthesis of VLSI circuits to derive a latency-constrained algorithm that reorders the instructions in a basic block of assembly code in application software to reduce power consumption due to its execution. The scheduling algorithm takes the data dependency graph (DDG) for a given basic block and a power dissipation table (PDT), which is generated by characterizing the instruction set architecture. We model power, commonly referred to as software power in literature, as a force to be minimized by relating the inter-instruction power cost as the spring constant,k,and the change in instruction probability as the displacement,x, in the force equation f = k * x. The salient feature of our algorithm is that it accounts for the global effect of any <b>tentative</b> <b>scheduling</b> decision, which avoids a solution being trapped in a local minima. The power estimates are obtained through using a tool set, called Simple-Power. Experimental results indicate that our technique accounts for an average of 12. 68 % savings in power consumption over the original source code for the selected benchmark programs...|$|R
