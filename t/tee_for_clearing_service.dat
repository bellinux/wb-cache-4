5000|$|By {{the time}} of a planned two-year OFT review in 2009, the Payments Council had taken over some {{activities}} from the Association <b>for</b> Payment <b>Clearing</b> <b>Services</b> (APACS), which no longer exists. One of the tasks of the Payments Council was to implement the Faster Payments <b>Service,</b> taking <b>clearing</b> times in the UK from among the slowest to among the fastest in the world. Criticisms made in 2009 included delays and shortcomings in delivery, and inability to ensure that Faster Payments members promptly passed on benefits to their customers.|$|R

50|$|In {{one corner}} of the control room was a pre-internet {{teleprinter}} terminal providing news wire service. Teleprinters generated many yards of hardcopy on paper throughout the day. The night announcer was responsible <b>for</b> <b>clearing</b> the wire <b>service</b> area of the accumulated teleprinter paper {{at the end of the}} broadcast day. In 1992 an announcer emptied an ash tray from the broadcast control room into the same trash can as the accumulated paper. The resulting blaze destroyed the building.|$|R
500|$|The Su-25UB trainer (Uchebno-Boyevoy) {{was drawn}} up in 1977. The first prototype, called [...] "T-8UB-1", was rolled out in July 1985 and its maiden flight {{was carried out}} at the Ulan-Ude factory {{airfield}} on 12 August of that year. By the end of 1986, 25 Su-25UBs had been produced at Ulan-Ude before the twin-seater completed its State trials and officially <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> <b>service</b> with the Soviet Air Force.|$|R
5|$|During {{the first}} eight months of {{operational}} trials, a total of 16 in-flight engine failures and 49 unscheduled engine changes punctuated the ongoing engine dilemma and delayed the in-service date until February 1957, roughly two years late. The Britannia received a fair amount of attention in both the popular press and the British House of Commons, especially when it was revealed that BOAC had contemplated fitting Rolls-Royce Tynes to their fleet of Douglas DC-7s as an interim measure until the Britannia was <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The 1,350PS (1,332hp, 993kW) DB 601 E {{was used}} in the F-3 and F-4 model {{together}} with a VDM 9-12010 propeller with broader blades for improved altitude performance. The DB 601 E was initially restricted to 1,200PS (1,184hp, 883kW) at 2,500 rpm; however, the full rating of 1,350PS at 2,500 rpm was <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> <b>service</b> use by February 1942. The DB 601 E ran on standard 87 octane [...] "B-4" [...] aviation fuel, despite its increased performance; while the earlier DB 601 N required 100 octane [...] "C-3" [...] fuel.|$|R
50|$|The {{first six}} {{production}} Venom {{also participated in}} trials performed by both de Havilland and the A&AEE. On 21 April 1952, the first delivery of a production-standard Venom, a single-seat fighter-bomber, occurred to the Central Fighter Establishment, where it was used for a full service evaluation prior to the type being <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> active <b>service.</b> During 1952, the initial production model entered operational service with the RAF as the Venom FB 1. A total of 375 of this initial model were constructed.|$|R

40|$|Implementing the {{rigorous}} governance and ownership standards {{established in the}} Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 3 <b>for</b> derivatives <b>clearing</b> organizations (DCOs) will promote free and open access to clearing and reduce systemic risk within {{what is now the}} $ 700 trillion notional value derivatives market. Such standards are central to and advance the key regulatory tenants of Dodd-Frank: i. e., to restore transparency, capital adequacy, and accountability to what was the unregulated over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market by ensuring that swaps are cleared through financially sound DCOs. Also, these rules will promote competition by curtailing large swap dealers‘ (SDs) control over these markets to the disadvantage of swaps users. This article focuses on the importance of swaps clearing to Dodd-Frank-mandated market reforms and the need for fair and open access to that clearing. Specifically, it shows that implementing objective governance standards for DCOs that include maximum capital requirements for DCO membership will enhance market stability and efficiency. To this end, the article focuses exclusively on clearing as it {{lies at the heart of}} Dodd Frank market reforms. Also, although the article discusses the SEC‘s proposed rules on DCO governance and ownership, it primarily focuses on the CFTC‘s rulemaking for DCOs since the CFTC has jurisdiction over 85 % of the derivatives market. The article is divided into four parts. First, it shows that Congress intended the CFTC to adopt rigorous rules regarding DCO governance and ownership that eliminate the conflicts of interest that have allowed SDs to stifle competition <b>for</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>services</b> and to charge unnecessarily high transaction fees. Second, it explains how pre-Dodd-Frank market forces have limited access to clearing. Third, it shows that the CFTC‘s final rule on participant eligibility—particularly the rule establishing a $ 50 million threshold for DCO membership—promises to both improve swap users‘ access to clearing and ensure greater stability within the derivatives clearing market. Finally, the article argues that the CFTC should strengthen its proposed governance standards for DCOs in order to safeguard swap users‘ access to clearing against the possibility that the CFTC‘s participant eligibility requirements fail to increase DCO membership...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the options}} <b>for</b> earning a <b>Clear</b> Administrative <b>Services</b> Credential is {{completion}} of Modules 1, 2 and 3 of a State Board of Education-approved Administrator Training Program (ATP). Certain provisions of the Education Code (EC), relating to using the ATP for credentialing purposes, become inoperative or are repealed in 2012 and 2013. To give individuals sufficient time {{to meet the requirements}} and obtain the ATP Certificate of Completion, transition dates were set with a final issuance date of April 1, 2014 <b>for</b> the <b>Clear</b> Administrative <b>Services</b> Credential using the ATP option. The California Department of Education (CDE) recently announced the opportunity for local educational agencies (LEAs), county offices of education, and direct‐funded charter schools to apply for an additional year of federal Title II funds for the ATP to provide training for principals and assistant/vice principals. This additional year of funding does not affect the dates listed in this correspondence.

50|$|For example, {{a lender}} {{advertising}} a home loan might have advertised the loan with a 5% interest rate, {{but then when}} one applies for the loan one is told that one must use the lender's affiliated title insurance company and pay $5,000 for the service, whereas the normal rate is $1,000. The title company would then have paid $4,000 to the lender. This was made illegal, {{in order to make}} prices <b>for</b> the <b>services</b> <b>clear</b> so as to allow price competition by consumer demand and to thereby drive down prices.|$|R
50|$|On 27 August 2009, David Van Buren, {{assistant}} secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, said {{that there would be}} a production gap for the JASSM while further tests were held. Further tests in 2009 were more successful however, with 15 out of 16 rounds hitting the intended target, well above the 75% benchmark set for the test. As such JASSM is now <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> <b>service</b> entry. The United States Air Force plans to acquire up to 4,900 AGM-158 missiles. Meanwhile, the United States Navy had originally planned to acquire 453 AGM-158 missiles but pulled out of the program in favor of employing the proven SLAM-ER.|$|R
50|$|The {{first test}} {{launch of the}} AJ.168 took place in February 1970 {{and a total of}} 25 were fired by the time testing ended in July 1973, mostly at RAF Aberporth in Wales. Further testing was carried out until October 1975, when it was <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> <b>service.</b> It was used only briefly by the Royal Navy before they turned the {{remainder}} of their Buccaneers over to the RAF. The RAF used both the anti-radar and anti-ship versions on their Buccaneers, with the anti-ship versions being replaced by the Sea Eagle in 1988, while the AS.37 anti-radar versions remained in use until the Buccaneers were retired in March 1994.|$|R

A goal of CN's marketing campaign {{was to get the}} train into service for Expo '67, and the Turbo was rushed through its trials. It was late for Expo, a disappointment to all involved, but the hectic pace did not let up and it was <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> <b>service</b> after only one year of testing.|$|R
