5|$|A later report {{covering}} the use the Tallboy bomb {{was able to}} directly compare {{the performance of the}} Mk. XIV and SABS in similar mission profiles. Eliminating bombs <b>that</b> <b>fell</b> far from the target as gross errors, those <b>that</b> <b>fell</b> near the target were twice as close to it when using SABS. Additionally, the number of gross errors with the Mk. XIV was double that of the SABS. The report noted that this additional accuracy did not confer any sort of superiority because the Mk. XIV's tactical freedom in terms of manoeuvring offset any advantage when a long bomb run was not possible. They also noted that a mission using SABS to drop bombs on a target marker would not be any more accurate than the Mk. XIV.|$|E
5|$|There {{are close}} {{parallels}} between the 5th-century architecture and monuments of Quiriguá and Uaxactun in the northern Petén, a site <b>that</b> <b>fell</b> under the domination of Tikal in the late 4th century. The similarities show that Quiriguá remained strongly aligned with the great Tikal alliance network.|$|E
5|$|After {{production}} of Fire and Ice wrapped, Bakshi attempted several projects <b>that</b> <b>fell</b> through, including adaptations of Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, William Kotzwinkle's The Fan Man, Eric Rücker Eddison's The Worm Ouroboros, Stephen Crane's , Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer novels and an anthropomorphic depiction of Sherlock Holmes. He turned down offers to direct Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes and Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? He passed {{the latter to}} Ridley Scott, who adapted it into the 1982 film Blade Runner.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} the punt, Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan connected on a 31-yard pass to wide receiver Brandon Robinson. As before, however, the offense stalled. On 4th-and-1 from the Virginia Tech 30-yard line, Ryan attempted a pass <b>that</b> <b>fell</b> incomplete, turning {{the ball over}} on downs. As a result of pressure applied by the Boston College defense, the Hokies continued to have difficulty moving the ball.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, the National Guard offered {{shelters for}} at least 400homeless {{residents}} in Stuart. Of the 7,900families adversely affected by the hurricane, 4,325required assistance from the American Red Cross. Farmers in Texas, also affected by a major hurricane, requested growers in Florida wait 15days so they could sell their citrus crop <b>that</b> <b>fell.</b> The damaged dam near Tampa initially resulted in waters from the Hillsborough River being pumped into the city's water treatment plant, and a new dam was eventually built in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Although {{its surface}} {{circulation}} had dissipated, its circulation aloft remained intact {{and led to}} a burst of rainfall early on August 20. The 11.94inches/303.3mm <b>that</b> <b>fell</b> at Miller became the wettest Missouri rainfall total associated with a tropical cyclone, or its remains, since at least 1972. One person died in Sleeper when he drove into flood waters which had swept away a bridge he was attempting to navigate onto. Nine water rescues occurred along the I-44 corridor, mostly caused by Erin's rainfall. Damage totaled about $19.8million (2007USD) in the state, primarily in Polk County.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, a huge {{building}} project centred around Coronation Square (named for the 1953 Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II) {{with hundreds of}} council houses built to satisfy post-war demand. The residents {{of many of these}} had moved from houses in central and east Reading <b>that</b> <b>fell</b> short of sanitation requirements of the Public Health Act 1875, were compulsorily purchased and later demolished.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages {{the area was}} a farm, growing to a wealthy estate <b>that</b> <b>fell</b> into {{disrepair}} towards 1900. It was bought in 1919 by Scout Commissioner William de Bois Maclaren and given to The Scout Association of the United Kingdom to provide camping to London Scouts, and training for Scouters. As Scout Leaders from all {{countries of the world}} have come to Gilwell Park for their Wood Badge training, {{it is one of the}} landmarks of the world Scouting movement.|$|E
5|$|It {{was another}} 12 {{minutes before the}} {{collapse}} occurred, which enabled trains and platforms to be evacuated and incoming trains to be held back. The roof, girders and debris fell across four passenger trains, blocking all tracks. The part of the western wall <b>that</b> <b>fell</b> had crashed through the wall and roof of the neighbouring Royal Avenue Theatre (now the Playhouse Theatre) in Northumberland Avenue, which was being reconstructed at the time. Six people died (two workmen on the roof, a W.H. Smith bookstall vendor and three workmen on the Royal Avenue Theatre site).|$|E

5|$|Since NASA's Space Shuttle {{program had}} not been launched, Derek Meddings and his miniatures team had to create the rocket launch footage without any reference. Shuttle models {{attached}} to bottle rockets and signal flares were used for take-off, and the smoke trail was created with salt <b>that</b> <b>fell</b> from the models. The space scenes were done by rewinding the camera after an element was shot, enabling other elements to be superimposed in the film stock, with the space battle needing up to forty rewinds to incorporate everything.|$|E
5|$|Solis was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential bid; when <b>that</b> <b>fell</b> short, Barack Obama aggressively sought her support, as part of strengthening his appeal to Hispanic voters. She supported Clinton's effort to establish a U.S. Public Service Academy and was a co-sponsor of a House bill to create one. Solis did not become wealthy from her political career; by 2008, she and her husband's main assets consisted of retirement funds and his auto shop, valued at under $100,000.|$|E
5|$|The Germans soon intervened {{to assist}} Italy. Hitler sent German forces to Libya in February, {{and by the}} end of March the Axis had {{launched}} an offensive which drove back the Commonwealth forces which had been weakened to support Greece. In under a month, Commonwealth forces were pushed back into Egypt with the exception of the besieged port of Tobruk <b>that</b> <b>fell</b> later. The Commonwealth attempted to dislodge Axis forces in May and again in June, but failed on both occasions.|$|E
50|$|The Noveschi or the IX were a mercantile-banking oligarchy that {{ruled the}} Italian {{city-state}} of Siena from 1287 to 1355 AD They oversaw {{the period of}} Siena's greatest stability and prosperity in the Medieval era.

5|$|The {{deployment}} to East Timor {{highlighted the}} limits of the Australian Defence Force and the need for an Army Reserve that could effectively provide deployable capabilities and individuals to round-out to the Regular Army in times of heavy operational commitment. As such, in late 2000 the government did what many governments had toyed with since the formation of the citizen force almost a hundred years earlier: enacting legislation that enabled the call-up of Reservists to full-time service in circumstances <b>that</b> <b>fell</b> short of a full scale defence emergency, thereby allowing their deployment overseas, while also protecting their employment and providing remuneration to employers.|$|E
5|$|The four giant {{planets are}} also orbited by {{planetary}} rings of varying size and complexity. The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny 'moonlets' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure. Although {{the origins of}} planetary rings is not precisely known, they {{are believed to be}} the result of natural satellites <b>that</b> <b>fell</b> below their parent planet's Roche limit and were torn apart by tidal forces.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match was}} between Mickie James and Trish Stratus for the WWE Women's Championship. The match had {{escalated}} outside the ring. When Stratus delivered punches to Mickie, {{who was on}} the second turnbuckle, Mickie threw her over the top rope, causing Stratus to land on her right arm. Afterwards, Mickie choked Stratus with a wristband she was wearing <b>that</b> <b>fell</b> off during the match, therefore giving the win to Stratus by disqualification, but per WWE regulations, a title can only change hands via pinfall or submission therefore Mickie retained the Championship.|$|E

5|$|These {{additional}} {{revenues were}} expected, {{when combined with}} spending cuts including a reduction of $200 million in higher education spending, to meet the state's balanced-budget requirement. A clause was also inserted into the budget cutting state aid for schools that hold over $1 billion in endowments. The only school in New Jersey <b>that</b> <b>fell</b> into this category was Princeton University, which had an endowment with assets over $11 billion in 2006. The university that had the largest endowment next to Princeton {{at the time was}} Drew University which had a $225 million endowment fund.|$|E
5|$|A major {{report was}} {{published}} in January 1998 by The New York Times detailing Zardari's vast corruption and misuse of public funds. The report discussed $200 million in kickbacks to Zardari and a Pakistani partner for a $4 billion contract with French military contractor Dassault Aviation, in a deal <b>that</b> <b>fell</b> apart only when the Bhutto government was dismissed. It contained details of two payments of $5 million each by a gold bullion dealer {{in return for a}} monopoly on gold imports. It had information from Pakistani investigators that the Bhutto family had allegedly accrued more than $1.5 billion in illicit profits through kickbacks in virtually every sphere of government activity. It also reported Zardari's mid-1990s spending spree, which included {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} spent on jewellery. The arrangements made by the Bhutto family for their wealth relied on Western property companies, Western lawyers, and a network of Western friends. The report described how Zardari had arranged secret contracts, painstaking negotiations, and the dismissal of anyone who objected to his dealings.|$|E
5|$|A ruined castle {{dominated}} the ridge across which the coastal pass led to Platamon. During {{the night of}} 15 April, a German motorcycle battalion supported by a tank battalion attacked the ridge, but the Germans were repulsed by the New Zealand 21st Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Neil Macky, which suffered heavy losses in the process. Later that day, a German armoured regiment arrived and struck the coastal and inland flanks of the battalion, but the New Zealanders held. After being reinforced during {{the night of the}} 15th–16th, the Germans assembled a tank battalion, an infantry battalion and a motorcycle battalion. The infantry attacked the New Zealanders' left company at dawn, while the tanks attacked along the coast several hours later. The New Zealanders soon found themselves enveloped on both sides, after the failure of the Western Macedonia Army to defend the Albanian town of Koritsa <b>that</b> <b>fell</b> unopposed to the Italian 9th Army on 15 April, forcing the British to abandon the Mount Olympus position and resulting in the capture of 20,000 Greek troops.|$|E
