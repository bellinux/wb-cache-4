40|$|Electricity demand {{traditionally}} {{exhibits a}} substantial peak during {{a small number}} of hours each day. Policymakers are aware of the potential efficiency savings that may be generated from a shift in energy consumption away from peak times. Smart meters, in conjunction with time-of-use (TOU) pricing, can facilitate an improvement in energy efficiency by providing consumers with enhanced information about electricity consumption and costs, and thereby encourage a shift away from consumption during peak hours. In 2009 - 10, the Irish Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) co-ordinated a randomised controlled trial in the Irish residential electricity market. Smart meters, which replaced the existing mechanical meter readers, were introduced in approximately 5, 000 households. Participants were divided into control and treatment groups, with treatment groups exposed to a variety of TOU <b>tariffs</b> and <b>information</b> stimuli (in-home display (IHD) units, monthly billing, etc.). Data was collected over approximately 18 months, with the first half year being used as a control period. This paper analyses the response of Irish households to the introduction of TOU <b>tariffs</b> and <b>information</b> stimuli. We examine how households responded to the different TOU tariffs, at different times of the day (peak, day and night) and in conjunction with different information stimuli. Finally, we examine the variation in our results across households of differing socio-economic status (as proxied by education levels). We find that TOU <b>tariffs</b> and <b>information</b> stimuli have a significant effect in reducing electricity consumption in Ireland, particularly during peak hours. However, while households reduce peak demand significantly after the introduction of TOU <b>tariffs</b> and associated <b>information,</b> there is little incremental response to increasing differentials between peak and off-peak prices. ...|$|R

30|$|Participants lamented {{about the}} {{numerous}} government policies that negatively impacted {{on the small}} businesses in the district. These include high district assembly levy and high utility <b>tariffs.</b> <b>Information</b> obtained during interviews with executives of micro-entrepreneur associations revealed {{that there are no}} government policies to directly regulate the interest rates charged by microfinance companies in the area, resulting in the exploitation of micro-entrepreneurs through high interest rates. The executives further revealed that even though the traditional bank (GCB Bank Limited) in the study area charged lower interest rates, only few of the female participants applied for loans with the Bank. It was further found that even those financial institutions who were giving loans were extremely cautious {{as a result of the}} risk associated with it. The financial institutions gave reasons such as lack of codified business strategy, proper costing and poor data systems about businesses and their owners as the main reasons for their reluctance in giving loans. This finding is in tandem with earlier findings of Ghosh et al. (2017) and Karanja et al. (2014) in a similar findings in Bangladesh and Kenya respectively. This is because they could not meet the strict requirements such as the provision of business documents and plan required by the bank. It was also found that micro-entrepreneurs in the LMKD are negatively affected by government policies such as the district assembly levy, high utility tariffs, and high interest rates. The above findings are similar to the findings by Chea (2008), Obeng 2007, Ahiawodzi and Adade (2012) who reported that government policies including taxation impeded the growth and development of small businesses in Ghana.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the amount of "policy space" {{available}} to increase tariff protection in South African agriculture. To this end, formal definitions for agricultural produce, actual import data, applied tariff data and bound tariff rates and <b>tariff</b> quota <b>information</b> were used to investigate the extent to which it is possible and feasible to increase tariffs. The analysis shows that in general the policy space available to South African agriculture is limited because of, among others, WTO binding and treaty obligations under the EU and SADC agreements.

40|$|The paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} decentralized metering decisions when selective metering is socially optimal. Households choose between two-part tariffs. Decentralization achieves social efficiency when the regulator, who knows household characteristics, gives household-specific compensation (via {{a reduction in the}} lump-sum charge on choosing to have a meter), while allowing for the cost of metering. Relative to the status quo of no metering the full-information scheme provides a Pareto improvement. With asymmetric information the first-best allocation of meters can be achieved when only small consumers should have meters. When large consumers alone should be metered {{it is not possible to}} separate customers. An exogenous signal that is highly correlated with the unknown type can, however, help to alleviate this problem. The policy of requiring meters to be provided free is problematic because the first-best allocation does not enable all the water supplier`s costs to be recovered.
