5|$|Historian Samuel E. Morison {{noted in}} 1949 that Spruance was {{subjected}} to much criticism for not pursuing the retreating Japanese, thus allowing their surface fleet to escape. Clay Blair argued in 1975 that had Spruance pressed on, {{he would have been}} unable to launch his aircraft after nightfall, and his cruisers would have been overwhelmed by Yamamoto's powerful surface units, including Yamato. Furthermore, the American air groups had suffered considerable losses, including most of their torpedo bombers. This made it unlikely that they would be effective in an airstrike against the Japanese battleships, even if they had managed to catch <b>them</b> <b>during</b> daytime. Also, by this time Spruance's destroyers were critically low on fuel.|$|E
