5|$|The 1985–86 {{series in}} the West Indies ended in another {{whitewash}} with the West Indies winning each Test comfortably, the closest match being a seven wicket victory. Like the previous series the English batsmen provided little resistance against the West Indian bowlers with only Gower averaging above 30. Poor performances from Botham and Mike Gatting's injury ensured an easy series win for the West Indies. England’s attitude also {{played a part in}} their defeat with big players such as Gower and Botham showing a certain reluctance to net training. The then chairman of selectors Peter May questioned the team's attitude and called for greater resolve, a view <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shared by the general public at the time.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} act {{of civil disobedience}} during the Pittston strike was Moss 3.

Union members knew that something had to be done to regain the spirit of the strike and make it clear to Pittston that they would not give up.|$|E

5|$|Nineteenth and {{twentieth century}} avant-garde artistic {{movements}} {{took an interest}} in the typographical arts, greatly enriching book design and illustration. In the late nineteenth century, William Morris founded the Arts and Crafts movement, which emphasized the value of traditional craft skills <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> disappearing in the mass industrial age. His designs, like the work of the Pre-Raphaelite painters with whom he was associated, referred frequently to medieval motifs. In 1891 he founded the Kelmscott Press, which by the time it closed in 1898 had produced over fifty works using traditional printing methods, a hand-driven press and hand-made paper. They included his masterpiece, an edition of the Works of Geoffrey Chaucer with illustrations by Edward Burne-Jones. Morris also invented three distinctive typefaces - Golden, Troy, and Chaucer, with the text being framed with intricate floral borders similar to illuminated medieval manuscripts. His work inspired many small private presses in the following century.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977, about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen, {{including}} {{a large group of}} Swedish tourists. About 6:20am, the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service, when one of them noticed smoke <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> coming from the freight elevator (which had not been used since the café-restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening). The night porter was alerted. Contrary to instructions, he did not call the fire department immediately; instead, he poured some buckets of water into the shaft, in an attempt to subdue the fire. By the time he decided to call the fire department, the hotel was filling with smoke. The night porter was unable to reach the phone at the front desk because the fire had already reached it. The porter then ran outside, where he stopped the driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel, and instructed him to drive to the Hotel Krasnapolsky to warn them and to call the fire department.|$|E

25|$|This work {{culminated in}} the work of Isaac Newton. Newton's Principia {{formulated}} the laws of motion and universal gravitation, which dominated scientists' view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. By deriving Kepler's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity, and then using the same principles to account for the trajectories of comets, the tides, the precession of the equinoxes, and other phenomena, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the cosmos. This work also demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies could be described by the same principles. His prediction that the Earth should be shaped as an oblate spheroid was later vindicated by other scientists. His laws of motion were to be the solid foundation of mechanics; his law of universal gravitation combined terrestrial and celestial mechanics into one great system <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to describe the whole world in mathematical formulae.|$|E
25|$|Henry Cow {{returned}} to London in early 1977, where they {{merged with the}} entire Mike Westbrook Brass Band and folk singer Frankie Armstrong to form the Orckestra. They played their first concert at the Moving Left Revue at The Roundhouse in London {{and then at the}} Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park. The Orckestra later went on to tour in France, Italy and Scandinavia (extracts from some of these performances were released in 2006 on a CD-single included in the Henry Cow Box). At {{more or less the same}} time they set up Music for Socialism and its May Festival. It had been three years since Henry Cow had performed more than one concert a year in their own country. In an attempt to break the apathy <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> discouraging anyone from wanting to put them on, they tried to organise a small alternative tour themselves, but abandoned it after 11 concerts when they started losing money: clearly nothing had changed.|$|E

25|$|The late 15th century saw the {{ascension}} of {{the powerful}} Craiovești family, virtually independent rulers of the Oltenian banat, who sought Ottoman support in their rivalry with Mihnea cel Rău (1508–1510) and replaced him with Vlăduț. After the latter proved to be hostile to the bans, the House of Basarab formally ended {{with the rise of}} Neagoe Basarab, a Craioveşti. Neagoe's peaceful rule (1512–1521) was noted for its cultural aspects (the building of the Curtea de Argeş Cathedral and Renaissance influences). It was also a period of increased influence for the Saxon merchants in Brașov and Sibiu, and of Wallachia's alliance with Louis II of Hungary. Under Teodosie, the country was again under a four-month-long Ottoman occupation, a military administration <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an attempt to create a Wallachian Pashaluk. This danger rallied all boyars in support of Radu de la Afumaţi (four rules between 1522 and 1529), who lost the battle after an agreement between the Craiovești and Sultan Süleyman the Magnificent; Prince Radu eventually confirmed Süleyman's position as suzerain and agreed to pay an even higher tribute.|$|E

500|$|Hemingway {{said that}} he learned what he needed as a {{foundation}} for his writing from the style sheet for The Kansas City Star, where he worked as cub reporter. [...] The critic John Aldridge says that the minimalist style resulted from Hemingway's belief that to write authentically, each word had to be carefully chosen for its simplicity and authenticity and carry a great deal of weight. Aldridge writes that Hemingway's style [...] "of a minimum of simple words <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> squeezed onto the page against a great compulsion to be silent, creates the impression that those words—if only because there are so few of them—are sacramental." [...] In Paris Hemingway had been experimenting with the prosody of the King James Bible, reading aloud with his friend John Dos Passos. From the style of the biblical text, he learned to build his prose incrementally; the action in the novel builds sentence by sentence, scene by scene and chapter by chapter.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, PedroII worked to prevent quarrels between the {{national}} political parties from impairing the military response. The Emperor prevailed over a serious political crisis in July 1868 resulting from a quarrel between the cabinet and Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (then-Marques and later Duke of Caxias), the commander-in-chief of the Brazilian forces in Paraguay. Caxias was also a politician {{and was a member}} of the opposing party to the ministry. [...] The Emperor sided with him, leading to the cabinet's resignation. As PedroII maneuvered to bring about a victorious outcome in the conflict with Paraguay, he threw his support behind the political parties and factions <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> most useful in the effort. The reputation of the monarchy was harmed and its trusted position as an impartial mediator was severely impacted in the long term. He was unconcerned for his personal position, and regardless of the impact upon the imperial system, he determined to put the national interest ahead of any potential harm caused by such expediencies.|$|E
500|$|This {{conclusion}} {{has been}} extensively challenged by writers who have shown original elements in Lie's work. Tio noted that in translating Kapitein Flamberge, Lie had changed the ending: the main character no longer died in an explosion of dynamite, but survived to marry his love interest, Hermine de Morlay. In exploring the similarities between Sjair Abdoel Moeloek and Siti Akbari, Zaini-Lajoubert noted that the main plot elements in both stories are the same, although some are present in one story and not the other– or given more detail. She found that the two differed greatly in their styles, especially Lie's emphasis on description and realism. Salmon wrote that Tjhit Liap Seng general plot mostly followed that of Klaasje Zevenster, with some sections <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> direct translations. However, she found that Lie also added, subtracted, and modified contents; she noted his more sparse approach to description {{and the introduction of}} a new character, Thio Tian, who had lived in Java. The Indonesian literary critic Jakob Sumardjo summarised that Lie [...] "may be said to have been original in his style, but not in his material".|$|E
