5000|$|Despite wide use by politicians, {{judges and}} academics, <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> has been {{described}} as [...] "an exceedingly elusive notion". [...] Among modern legal theorists, one finds that at least two principal conceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> can be identified: a formalist or [...] "thin" [...] definition, and a substantive or [...] "thick" [...] definition; one occasionally encounters a third [...] "functional" [...] conception. [...] Formalist definitions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> do not make a judgment about the [...] "justness" [...] <b>of</b> <b>law</b> itself, but define specific procedural attributes that a legal framework must have in order to be in compliance with <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> Substantive conceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> go beyond this and include certain substantive rights that are said to be based on, or derived from, <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the seminal}} Court of Appeal {{decision}} Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the respondents submitted that the President's discretion under section 8(1) was subjective, {{and so was}} not open to review by the courts. The appellants argued that the discretion was objective, and thus {{a court of law}} could review the grounds on which the discretion had been exercised. The Court held that an objective test applied to the subjectively worded powers in sections 8 and 10, and hence the exercise of these powers was normally challengeable on the GCHQ grounds of judicial review. In coming to this decision, it disapproved of a 1971 High Court decision, Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs, which had held to the contrary. While the Court's views regarding the applicability of an objective test were obiter, later Singapore decisions have confirmed this as the correct approach. It gave several reasons for its decision. First, the reasoning in cases supporting a subjective test was found to be questionable, and, secondly, such a test was inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Finally, the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion was contrary to <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> all powers had legal limits.|$|E
5|$|One {{matter in}} which he {{invested}} much effort was the political situation of the Viceroyalty of Peru. In Peru, power struggles between conquistadors and the viceroy became an open civil war in which the conquistadors led by Gonzalo Pizarro rebelled against the New Laws and defeated and executed the viceroy Blasco Núñez Vela in 1546. The Emperor sent Pedro de la Gasca, a friend of Las Casas, to reinstate <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> <b>and</b> he in turn defeated Pizarro. In order to restabilize the political situation the encomenderos started pushing {{not only for the}} repeal of the New Laws, but for turning the encomiendas into perpetual patrimony of the encomenderos – the worst possible outcome from Las Casas's point of view. The encomenderos offered to buy the rights to the encomiendas from the crown, and Charles V was inclined to accept since his wars had left him in deep economic troubles. Las Casas worked hard to convince the king {{that it would be a}} bad economic decision, that it would return the viceroyalty to the brink of open rebellion, and could result in the crown losing the colony entirely. The Emperor, probably because of the doubts caused by Las Casas's arguments, never took a final decision on the issue of the encomiendas.|$|E

40|$|Pan Wei {{argues that}} what China needs first is <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> not democracy. According to Pan, {{there are four}} kinds of {{relationships}} between democracy and <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law: democratic government without <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> (mostly third world countries); nondemocratic government with <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> (Hong Kong and Singapore); democratic government with <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> (mostly Western countries); and nondemocratic government without <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> (again mostly third world countries). According to Pan, the first combination is actually the worst outcome since a democracy without <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> is {{likely to result in}} chaos, corruption, and general governance problems. This is why most third world democracies are not successful in terms of political stability and sustainable development. According to Pan, the second pattern, nondemocratic government with <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> has been proven to be a viable political option, especially for countries without democratic traditions. Hong Kong and Singapore are well-governed societies with efficient and clean government. Therefore Pan concludes that at least in the mid-term future, China should focus its political reform on building up <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> since that can best ensure the emergence of successful democracies as in the West. Moreover, Pan even suggests that due to its history and culture, <b>the</b> Singapore option <b>of</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> without democracy may also suit China in the long run. As a result. Pan prescribes a future polity that embodies <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> but shuns competitive democracy...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> {{is an essential}} factor and indispensable value of a modem democracy. Establishing <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> {{is regarded as a}} priority to institutional reform in developing and transition countries. However, attempts to establish <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> often raise problems and fundamental questions. about the nature of this concept and conditions necessary for such reforms to succeed. This thesis examines and discusses <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> in theoretical and practical aspects: as a concept underlying the Western liberal-democratic system of government and as one of the main objectives of economic, political, and institutional reforms in Vietnam. The theoretical aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> is discussed with reference to Western jurisprudential and political perspectives. This discussion provides a conceptual framework for assessing and comparing <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> in Vietnam (a one party system) with the concept used in Western liberal democracies. For the practical aspect and case study, the theoretical standards discussed in the first part are applied to <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> reforms in Vietnam. This is followed by assessment of the compatibility or lack <b>of</b> it, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> with <b>the</b> Vietnamese context. The thesis identifies some of the main obstacles to effective reform and successful transition to a <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> polity/state in Vietnam, such as the informal institutions (Confucianism) and related to its social and political values. The main argument is that if <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> is not compatible with informal institutions rooted in society (e. g., Confucianism), the establishment of, or transition to <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> might fail. Therefore, Vietnam should not try to replicate <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> from <b>the</b> West in a mechanical and programmatic way. My thesis suggests that a model <b>of</b> a <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> polity in Vietnam should embrace a mixture of both Western democratic values and Eastern philosophies, which still, in some crucial way influence the Vietnamese society...|$|R

40|$|Democratic {{instability}} in the Andean region is often caused by an interaction between presidentialism and <b>the</b> weakness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> in <b>the</b> context of deep divisions in society.

To demonstrate the causal mechanisms linking constitutions and <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> to democratic instability, constitutional crises are analyzed in five Andean countries and contrasted with two comparable cases of parliamentarism from South Asia.
