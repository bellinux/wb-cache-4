40|$|The row-nucleated {{lamellar}} {{crystalline structure}} of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) films was prepared by applying elongation stress to HDPE melt during <b>T-die</b> cast film extrusion and subsequently annealing the extruded films. This unusual crystalline structure was analyzed {{in terms of}} lamellar crystalline orientation, long-period lamellar spacing, crystallite size, and degree of crystallinity. The contribution of melt-extension represented by draw-down-ratio (DDR) to the overall orientation {{was found to be}} most noticeable than other processing variables. Meanwhile, the long-period lamellar spacing, the crystallite size, and the degree of crystallinity were influenced predominantly by the annealing temperature. Finally, the processing (melt extension and annealing temperature) structure (lamellar crystalline structure) - property (hard elasticity) relationship of HDPE films was investigated. close 7...|$|E
40|$|Backlight modules are key {{components}} in thin-film transistor liquid crystal displays (TFT-LCD). Among {{the components of}} a backlight module, the light guide plate (LGP) plays the most important role controlling the light projected to the eyes of users. A wedge-shaped LGP, with its asymmetrical structure, is usually fabricated by an injection proces, but the fabrication time {{of this process is}} long. This study proposes a continuous extrusion process to fabricate wedge-shaped LGPs. This continuous process has advantages for mass production. Besides a <b>T-die</b> and rollers, this system also has an in situ monitor of the melt-bank that forms during the extrusion process, helping control the plate thickness. Results show that the melt bank has a close relationship with the plate thickness. The temperature of the bottom heater and roller was adjusted to reduce the surface deformation of the wedge-shaped plate. This continuous extrusion system can successfully manufacture wedge-shaped LGPs for mass production...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of hard elastic high-density polyethylene (HDPE) precursor films {{and its influence}} on the microporous membrane formation have been investigated. As a first step, the HDPE precursor films with 'row-nucleated lamellar crystalline' structure were prepared by applying elongation stress to the HDPE melt during <b>T-die</b> cast film extrusion and subsequently annealing the extruded films. This unusual crystalline structure was analyzed in terms of lamellar crystalline orientation, long-period lamellar spacing, crystallite size, and degree of crystallinity. The processing (melt extension and annealing temperature) -structure (lamellar crystalline structure) -property (hard elasticity) relationship of HDPE precursor films was also investigated. The uniaxial stretching of hard elastic HDPE precursor films induces the bending of crystalline lamellae, {{which leads to the}} formation of micropores between them. The observation of morphology and air permeability for the HDPE microporous membranes have revealed that the well-developed porous structures characterized by superior air permeability were established preferably from the precursor films prepared by the high stress levels and the high annealing temperatures. Finally, the relationship between the hard elasticity of HDPE precursor films and the air permeability of corresponding microporous membranes was discussed. close 322...|$|E
