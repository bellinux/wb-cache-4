5|$|Microbats possess magnetoreception, in <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> high {{sensitivity}} to Earth's magnetic field, similar to birds. However, microbats use a polarity-based compass, {{meaning that they}} differentiate north from south, as opposed to birds which use {{the strength of the}} magnetic field to differentiate latitudes, which may be used in long-distance travel. Since microbats generally have poor eyesight, it is thought they use a magnetite-based method for orientation.|$|E
5|$|Pursuit-deterrent {{signals are}} {{behavioral}} signals used by prey that convince predators {{not to pursue}} them. For example, gazelles stot, jumping high with stiff legs and an arched back. This is thought to signal to predators <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> high level of fitness and can outrun the predator. As a result, predators may choose to pursue a different prey that {{is less likely to}} outrun them.|$|E
5|$|The Andromeda Galaxy has a {{total of}} 15 {{satellite}} galaxies, including M32 and M110. Nine of these lie in a plane, which has caused astronomers to infer <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> common origin. These satellite galaxies, like the satellites of the Milky Way, tend to be older, gas-poor dwarf elliptical and dwarf spheroidal galaxies.|$|E

5|$|A full {{data set}} may consist of {{hundreds}} of separate images taken at different orientations of the crystal. The {{first step is to}} merge and scale these various images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images (merging) and to scale the relative images so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the relative intensity of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows calculating the symmetry-related R-factor, a reliability index based upon how similar are the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections, thus assessing the quality of the data.|$|E
5|$|Banished {{revolves}} around the player guiding citizens of a remote community of outcasts to grow and maintain a settlement through a command economy. The game focuses on the player's town as a whole, with {{the citizens of the}} town acting as a resource to be managed. The player must assign citizens to various jobs such as building or fishing. The citizens then perform the job without specific direction from the player. Citizens have needs that must be met in order to keep them happy and healthy, such as ensuring enough food is available or <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> home. Additional citizens come from two sources, the birth of children and the arrival of nomads, wandering groups that wish to join the player's town. The player's citizens will age and eventually die.|$|E
5|$|Each section, such as on {{reptiles}} at {{the start}} of Volume II (and the entire work) is introduced with an essay on distinguishing aspects of their zoology. In the case of the reptiles, the essay begins with the observation that their circulation is so arranged that only part of the blood pumped by the heart goes through the lungs; Cuvier discusses the implications of this arrangement, next observing <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> relatively small brain compared to the mammals and birds, and that none of them incubate their eggs.|$|E

The {{minister}} Aria Kebonan wants power for himself, and persuades the king to surrender the crown to him. Permana Dikoesoemah warns Aria Kebonan to respect him always and not to bother his wife. He then abdicates to meditate, ultimately ascending to a higher plane of existence. Aria Kebonan, meanwhile, magically gains the king's appearance, ensuring {{that the people of}} Galuh are unaware <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> new king.|$|E

However, an angered Michael fires him instead, also unintentionally entitling him to severance pay. When Michael learns that Jim is the No. 2 in the office, Dwight and Andy argue over who is No. 3. They find <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> common interest: their apparent fondness towards Michael.|$|E

5|$|Some {{very large}} events known as fests (short for festival) have {{hundreds}} or thousands of participants who are usually split into competing character factions camped separately around a large venue. There are relatively few fests in the world, all based in Europe and Canada; however, their size means <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant influence on local LARP culture and design. At {{the other end of the}} size scale, some small events known as linear or line-course LARPs feature a small group of PCs facing a series of challenges from NPCs and are often more tightly planned and controlled by GMs than other styles of LARP.|$|E
5|$|The book {{opens with}} a Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby facing {{the loss of his}} farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife Emily Shelby believe <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> benevolent {{relationship}} with their slaves, Shelby decides to raise the needed funds by selling two of them—Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of Emily Shelby's maid Eliza—to a slave trader. Emily Shelby is averse to this idea because she had promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to see Tom go because he sees the man as his friend and mentor.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of Zobel network filters is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> constant resistance image impedance {{and for this}} reason are also known as constant resistance networks. Clearly, the Zobel network filter does not have a problem matching to its terminations and this is its main advantage. However, other filter types have steeper transfer functions and sharper cut-offs. In filtering applications, the main role of Zobel networks is as equalisation filters. Zobel networks are in a different group from other image filters. The constant resistance means that when used in combination with other image filter sections the same problem of matching arises as with end terminations. Zobel networks also suffer the disadvantage of using far more components than other equivalent image sections.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the disc}} is an {{involucre}} of modified leaves, the bracts, which in Xerochrysum, {{as in most}} Gnaphalieae, are petal-like, stiff, and papery. Arranged in rows, these bracts curl over and enclose the florets, shielding them before flowering. They create {{the impression of a}} shiny and yellow corolla around the disc. The intermediate bracts are sometimes white, while the outer ones are paler and often streaked reddish or brown (a greater variety of colours are found in cultivars). These bracts are papery and dry, or 'scarious', with a low water content, unlike leaves or flower parts of other plants. They are made up of dead cells, which are unusual in <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> thin primary and a thick secondary cell wall, a feature only found in sclerenchyma, or structural, cells, not cells of flowers or leaves.|$|E
5|$|At the camp, Theo and Kee meet a Romanian woman, Marichka, who {{provides}} {{a room where}} Kee gives birth to a baby girl. The next day, Syd finds them in their room, and informs Theo and Kee that war has broken out between the British Army and the refugees, including the Fishes. Having learned <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bounty on their heads, Syd attempts to capture them, but Marichka and Theo fight him off and escape. Amidst the fighting, the Fishes capture Kee and the baby. Theo tracks them to an apartment under heavy fire where he confronts Luke, who is then killed by a tank shell, and escorts Kee and the baby out. Awed by the baby, the combatants temporarily stop fighting; staring at the screaming baby, they allow the group to leave. Marichka leads Theo, Kee, and the baby to a boat in a sewer, and Theo rows away whilst Marichka stays behind.|$|E
5|$|Harry and Debbie punish Annie by not {{allowing}} {{her to go to}} Naomi's party. When they reconsider and decide to let her go, they discover that she has already left. Harry goes to the party to find Annie, but is instead told by Tracy <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> son together, whom she gave up for adoption over twenty years ago. Adrianna, who had previously stolen money from Naomi's purse, claims to have found it and gives it back. Naomi checks her phone messages and learns that Ethan is cheating on her. Naomi asks Ethan if he is really cheating on her, and leaves the party after he fails to answer. Annie leaves with Silver for another party on the beach, where she apologizes to Ethan for revealing that he was cheating on Naomi. When she asks why he told the truth about Dixon not starting the fight, he replies that he is trying to be the good guy he used to be. Annie, Silver, Dixon and Navid {{spend the rest of the}} night swimming at the beach. In the closing scenes, Kelly talks to the father of her four-year-old son, Adrianna pays her drug dealer with money she stole from Naomi, and Ethan visits Naomi's house.|$|E

40|$|Although {{there has}} been growing {{interest}} in general practitioners' participation in promoting health, {{little is known about}} the attitudes of their patients. Thus we sent a copy of a self administered questionnaire (the Health Survey Questionnaire) to 3452 patients aged 17 - 70 who were registered with two practices in north west London. Questions about attitudes to and perceptions of general practitioners' interest in weight, smoking, drinking, and fitness problems were included. The patients were also asked whether <b>they</b> thought <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> problem in any of these areas. The response rate was 72 %. Of those who responded, the proportions who thought that their general practitioners should be interested ranged from 72 % in the case of fitness to 83 % for weight, but only 38 % thought that general practitioners had in fact been interested in fitness and only 48 % thought so about weight. Forty one per cent of the respondents thought <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> fitness problem, 42 % a weight problem, and 59 % of the smokers thought <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> smoking problem. Four per cent of respondents stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> drinking problem. Of those patients who said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> problem, the proportions who thought that their general practitioners had seemed interested ranged from 43 % for fitness to 69 % for smoking. The findings of this study suggest that greater participation by general practitioners in health promotion would be well received by most patients and that currently there may be considerable discrepancies between patients' expectations and their perception of their general practitioner's interest in these areas of preventive medicine...|$|R
5|$|The Dalek Prime Minister {{explains}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> planet {{known as}} the Asylum where they keep insane, battle-scarred Daleks. The Parliament has received a transmission of the Habanera Aria from the Asylum. The Doctor makes contact with {{the source of the}} transmission: the survivor of a starliner crash named Oswin Oswald. Oswin claims to have spent a year fending off Dalek attacks and making soufflés. The crash had ruptured the planet's force-field, thus risking escape of the insane Daleks. To prevent this, the Parliament wishes to destroy the planet remotely, but the force-field is still too strong to allow that. The Daleks task the Doctor, Amy and Rory with deactivating the force field from the planet. The three are given bracelets to protect them from the planet's nanogene cloud, which would convert them into Dalek puppets, before being dropped onto the planet.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{comes to}} the end of the {{transcript}} and Sally realises Larry has stopped writing it due to the presence of an Angel in the room. The Doctor, surmising their fate, warns them not even to blink around the Angels. Sally and Larry make their way to the basement of the house and discover more Angels guarding the TARDIS. The Angels attack and Sally and Larry use the Yale key to hide inside the TARDIS. The Angels surround and rock the TARDIS to try to gain entry. Once in the control room, a hologram of the Doctor informs them <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> control disk with them. Larry takes a now-glowing DVD from his pocket and inserts it into the console. The TARDIS' engines engage and the ship dematerialises, leaving a panicking Sally and Larry behind. With the TARDIS gone, the Angels who were all stood around the TARDIS have been tricked into looking at each other and have become permanently frozen as statues.|$|E
5|$|While Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is having}} a meeting with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) in his office, Robert California (James Spader) appears {{at the window and}} frantically says that his wife Susan (Maura Tierney) is looking for a job in the office, and that Andy must not give her one. When Susan arrives, Andy {{compliantly}} tells her that they have no openings, but Robert insists <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> look around before coming to any conclusions. Susan looks at the different departments, and decides on accounting. Andy again claims the office is already fully staffed, but Robert insists that he give her a job, even pressuring Andy by reminding him of his power as CEO. Confused by Robert's mixed messages, Andy relents and gives her a job, but Robert later calls Andy on the phone to berate him for hiring Susan. Andy asks everyone in the office to treat her poorly to drive her out, which makes everyone uncomfortable as they like her, but end up doing so nevertheless. When Susan notices their behavior, she complains to Robert, who asks Andy to discuss the issues with Susan in the conference room and leaves. Susan eventually realizes it was Robert's idea to drive her away. When they call Robert out, he vehemently denies it. Andy tells them Jim also heard him say he did not want her working at the office, which Jim overhears, prompting him to flee the office. Robert orders security to close the gate, preventing him from leaving. Jim then runs all over the building, but Andy and Robert find him and take him back to the office. After trying unsuccessfully to deflect their questions about what Robert told Andy, Jim blurts out that he is baffled at Robert's attitude, since Jim enjoys working in the same place as his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and misses her while she is on maternity leave. Andy and Jim leave the conference room and after a short while, Robert and Susan leave. In the parking lot, Andy apologizes to Susan and after brief small talk, Susan asks Andy out on a date, leaving him surprised.|$|E
40|$|We {{interviewed the}} general {{practitioners}} (GPs) of 40 patients with life-threatening illnesses {{over the course}} of the last year of life. We asked them to identify their patients' holistic needs, and to discuss whether <b>they</b> considered <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> role in providing 'spiritual care'. The GPs varied greatly in their understanding of their patients' experiences and needs. Most said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> role in providing spiritual care, but hesitated to raise spiritual issues with patients, mentioning lack of time, a feeling <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should wait for a cue, or being unprepared or unskilled...|$|R
