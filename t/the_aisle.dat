5|$|At a Jewish synagogue, where Grace and Leo's {{wedding is}} to take place, Grace learns from her mother, Bobbi (Debbie Reynolds), that her father {{will not be able}} to walk her down <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> Grace panics, but Karen {{suggests}} that Will should walk with her instead. She agrees and calls upon him. Although Will at first declines to give her away because of the prior argument, they make up and he finally escorts her down <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> After the wedding reception, Will, Grace, Leo, Jack, and Karen walk through Central Park enjoying Grace and Leo's marriage.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Gaudí's {{increasing}} fame, in 1902 the painter Joan Llimona chose Gaudí's features to represent Saint Philip Neri in the paintings for <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> of the Sant Felip Neri church in Barcelona. Together with Joan Santaló, son of his friend the physician Pere Santaló, he unsuccessfully founded a wrought iron manufacturing company the same year.|$|E
5|$|Grant married Myrtis Ann Halliburton in 1939 {{after a brief}} courtship; {{they had}} known each other for ten months before they walked down <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> When they met, he worked behind the dairy counter at the local A market where she was a customer.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} pseudo-basilican in style; <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> {{are almost as}} wide as the nave, <b>the</b> three <b>aisles</b> each have their own vault and the nave rises above <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> {{although}} a clerestory is missing.|$|R
50|$|Running <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> is an ecstatic {{expression}} of worship that occurs occasionally in some contexts of worship in the Pentecostal and Holiness movements in Christianity. As the expression suggests, {{when a person}} runs <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> in a worship setting, he leaves his seat and runs down <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> between seating sections, or he may run around the interior perimeter of the meeting house.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> skillion-roofed <b>aisles</b> {{also have}} raked clear {{finished}} timber boarded ceilings supported by exposed timber trusses. Narrow round arched windows illuminate <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> {{and a set}} of timber doors with fanlight over open to the exterior. Shrines dedicated to Jesus and Mary are located at the southeast ends of <b>the</b> <b>aisles.</b>|$|R
5|$|In this 6-minute short film, he entire kingdom is {{preparing}} for Rapunzel's marriage to Eugene. Several guests are in attendance, including Rapunzel's birth parents, the King and Queen, the pub thugs and the Stabbington Brothers, while their animal friends Pascal, a chameleon, and Maximus, a horse, serve as the Flower boy and ring bearer respectively. Just as a brown-haired Rapunzel, accompanied by her father, completes her journey down <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> to unite with Eugene, Maximus, who is carrying the wedding rings on a pillow in his mouth, has a reaction to one of Pascal's flower petals and sneezes, expelling the rings down <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> and out onto the city streets.|$|E
5|$|The south aisle was {{shortened}} {{in about}} 1870 by Scott, and given an apsidal east end, becoming the chapel of St Erasmus. The stained {{glass in the}} apse window is dated 1872 and is by Clayton and Bell. Below this is a mosaic designed by J.R.Clayton and made by Salviati, and a fresco painting by Clayton and Bell, dated 1874. Elsewhere the stained glass in <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> is by Wailes, and by Hardman & Co. to a design by Pugin. <b>The</b> <b>aisle</b> contains the tomb of Ranulf Higdon, a monk at St Werburgh's Abbey in the 12thcentury who wrote a major work of history entitled Polychronicon, a monument to Thomas Brassey (a civil engineering contractor who died in 1870), designed by Blomfield and made by Wagmuller, a monument to Bishop Peploe who died in 1752, and three painted monuments {{by a member of}} the Randle Holme family.|$|E
5|$|Following the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match, {{the second}} round of the tournament began. Razor Ramon {{attacked}} his opponent, I.R.S., in <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> before the match. The two brawled outside the ring. Afterwards, while using the ropes for leverage, I.R.S. gained the advantage inside the ring by applying a chinlock. Ramon escaped the hold, kicked Schyster and performed the Razor's Edge for the win.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>aisles</b> are plain {{with flat}} pilasters. The eastern two bays are Decorated with {{springing}} for vaulting. Whether the vault was ever constructed is unknown, the present wooden roof extends {{the full length}} of <b>the</b> <b>aisles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Of the whole, {{what remains}} is {{basically}} the painting from <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> and <b>the</b> arches separating the nave and <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> enough to reveal a rich iconographic programme with ample references {{to the story of}} the Redemption.|$|R
5|$|In 1184, a great fire at Glastonbury {{destroyed}} the monastic buildings. Reconstruction began almost immediately and the Lady Chapel, {{which includes the}} well, was consecrated in 1186. There is evidence that, in the 12th century, the ruined nave was renovated enough for services while the great new church was being constructed. Parts of the walls of <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> and crossing having been completed by 1189, progress then continued more slowly.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} {{corner of the}} south aisle {{of the church is}} a {{monument}} of the Baber family, who formerly had large possessions in the parish. Inserted in a window of <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> is a wooden effigy, supposed to be of Sir John de Hautville, a Knight of Henry III's, who owned the northeastern estate named Norton Hautville, now Norton Hawkfield: in the same directional corner of the church are monuments to the Strach(e)y family who lived at Sutton Court.|$|E
5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I walked down <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s {{just one of those}} moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from some}} {{fragments}} of 14th and 15th century stained glass in <b>the</b> north <b>aisle,</b> all <b>the</b> 10 windows in <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> and 8 in the celestorey are of plain leaded glass. The nave is some 57 ft long by 21 ft wide and <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> are 11 ft wide. The church can seat about 200 people at full capacity.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> {{interior}} <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> and <b>the</b> nave {{are divided}} by seven columns with arcades, made of material from ancient settlements of <b>the</b> area. <b>The</b> <b>aisles</b> {{are covered by}} groin vaults, while the nave has trusses.

5|$|On {{the south}} side of the church is the first major {{addition}} to the church: Lane's Aisle. This was built 1526–1529 by a local cloth merchant, John Lane (d.1529). It is fan vaulted in a style inspired by the Dorset aisle at Ottery St Mary and some of the carvings are similar to John Greenway's Chapel at Tiverton. John Lane and wife are buried at the east end of <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b>|$|E
5|$|September 30, 2002: Arturo Martinez Tapia {{assaulted}} a Greyhound driver near Fresno, California, {{resulting in}} two passenger deaths after the bus then rolled off an embankment and crashed. Following this attack, an aisle gate and driver's shield were installed on most Greyhound buses which prevent passengers from having {{direct contact with}} the driver when the bus is in motion, even if <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> gate is forced open.|$|E
5|$|The Springfield Elementary School Model United Nations club {{is going}} on a field trip. On the bus, Bart, Nelson, Ralph, and Milhouse play a game by racing fruit down <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> Milhouse rolls a {{grapefruit}} that gets stuck under the brakes. When Otto tries to press down on the pedal, it squirts juice into his eyes, causing him to lose control and drive the bus off a bridge.|$|E
50|$|The {{church of}} Santa Maria del Popolo is a Renaissance {{basilica}} with a nave and two aisles, and a transept {{with a central}} dome. The nave and <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> have four bays, and they are covered with cross-vaults. There are four piers on each side that support the arches separating the nave from <b>the</b> <b>aisles.</b> Each pillar has four travertine semi-columns, three of them supporting the arches and <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> vaulting while <b>the</b> taller fourth supports the nave vaults. The semi-columns have Composite capitals with a palmette ornament between the volutes.|$|R

5|$|After these slights, {{speculation}} {{was raised}} that Mathias {{would leave the}} Republican Party, especially as the 1980 elections were approaching. Several prominent conservatives in the state, such as U.S. Representatives Marjorie Holt and Robert Bauman, were considering challenging Mathias for his seat. In contrast, the Democratic side of <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> had fewer challengers, suggesting Mathias would win renomination more easily {{if he were to}} switch parties. However, Mathias chose to remain as a Republican, and teamed up with eight other Republican senators to express their dissatisfaction with the hard-line wing of the party. Mathias later stated that he had never seriously considered switching parties.|$|E
5|$|Arcades of {{semi-circular}} arches {{divide the}} nave from the aisles. On {{the south side}} of the cathedral, a large chapel, built in 1911, extends three bays parallel to <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> This chapel provides a more intimate place of worship than the main church or its aisles. The nave has a cross vaulted ceiling with clerestory windows above the arcades. The cathedral's main neoclassical altar of translucent alabaster is a modern replacement for the original wooden gothic altar, now located in the southern side chapel. The main altar, built in Burgos, Spain, was donated by the local Ferre family. Except for the side chapel where terrazzo is used, the cathedral's floor is of gray and white marble design.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} {{consists of}} a nave and two aisles, crossed by a transept.

Rhodes walked down <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> toward DiBiase and Sapphire but was attacked from behind by Savage. Savage controlled most of the match, and Sherri interfered to help him while the referee was distracted. Rhodes made a brief comeback, but Savage was able to pin him after hitting him with Sherri's purse, which was said to be loaded with a heavy object. After the match, Rhodes chased after DiBiase and Sapphire but was unable to catch up to their departing limousine.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was born}} in Silsbee, Texas. As a child, {{he was a big}} wrestling fan and André the Giant was his {{favorite}} wrestler. While attending a wrestling show in Beaumont, Texas, young Henry tried to touch André as he was walking down <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> but tripped over the barricade. André picked him up out of the crowd and put him back behind the barricade. When Henry was 12 years old, his father, Ernest, died of complications from diabetes. When he was 14 years old, Henry was diagnosed with dyslexia.|$|E
5|$|The 767 {{features}} a twin-aisle cabin with a typical configuration of six abreast in business class and seven across in economy. The standard seven abreast, 2–3–2 economy class layout places approximately 87percent of all seats at a window or aisle. As a result, the aircraft can be largely occupied before center seats {{need to be}} filled, and each passenger {{is no more than}} one seat from <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> It is possible to configure the aircraft with extra seats for up to an eight abreast configuration, but this is less common.|$|E
