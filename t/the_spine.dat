5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> does not {{necessarily}} mean better sexual function; for example, people with injuries in the sacral region {{are less likely to be}} able to orgasm than those with injuries higher on <b>the</b> <b>spine.</b> Women with injuries above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral injuries (59% vs 17%). In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to reflexes that do not require input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that measures}} {{the quality of}} a book embedding, beyond its number of pages, is its pagewidth. This is the maximum number of edges that can be crossed by a ray perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> within a single page. Equivalently (for book embeddings in which each edge is drawn as a monotonic curve), it is the maximum size of a subset of edges within a single page such that the intervals defined on <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> by pairs of endpoints of the edges all intersect each other.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>spines</b> of Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis {{are used}} for defense and {{locomotion}} and are not considered poisonous. <b>The</b> <b>spines</b> attach to small tubercles on the test where they are {{held in place by}} muscles creating a ball and socket joint.

40|$|The surface {{ultrastructure}} of Acanthotrema felis (Trematoda: Heterophyidae) adults, {{recovered from}} a kitten experimentally infected with the metacercariae, was observed using a scanning electron microscope. The worm was leaf-like, ventrally concave and covered with scale-like multi-pointed tegumental <b>spines.</b> <b>The</b> <b>spines</b> on <b>the</b> anterior surface were short but broad, and had 10 - 12 pointed tips. The cytoplasmic processes protruded around <b>the</b> <b>spines,</b> like pockets for <b>the</b> <b>spines.</b> <b>The</b> ventrogenital opening was crescent, or kidney-shaped, and had protuberances with minute spines on its surrounding tegument. <b>The</b> <b>spines</b> on <b>the</b> posterior surface were long, but narrow, with 6 - 8 pointed tips. The cytoplasmic processes on this tegument were ridge-like, and elevated along the row of <b>the</b> <b>spines.</b> <b>The</b> surface ultrastructure of A. felis is generally {{similar to that of}} other heterophyid flukes, but some features are characteristic, and may be of taxonomic and bio-ecological significance...|$|R
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in the ventricles {{of the brain and}} contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous plexus or soft tissues around <b>the</b> <b>spine.</b> Due to the sterile conditions of the soft tissues around <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E

5|$|The {{caudal fin}} is homocercal, meaning {{the upper and}} lower lobes are about equal in size. <b>The</b> <b>spine</b> ends at the caudal peduncle, the base of the caudal fin, {{distinguishing}} this group from those in which <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> extends into the upper lobe of the caudal fin, such as most fish from the Paleozoic (541 to 252 million years ago). The neural arches are elongated to form uroneurals which provide support for this upper lobe. In addition, the hypurals, bones that form a flattened plate at the posterior end of the vertebral column, are enlarged providing further support for the caudal fin.|$|E
5|$|The first 28 {{issues were}} 166 pages long. The page count dropped to 134 with the April 1954 issue and stayed at that length for the {{remainder}} of the run. The cover layout initially strongly resembled that of Other Worlds but was changed with the fifth issue, June 1951, to have a white background banner for the title. This format was retained for the rest of the magazine's life, with occasional slight variations such as using a different color for the banner background. <b>The</b> <b>spine</b> also changed from a colored spine with pale lettering, which was similar to <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> style used by Other Worlds, to a white spine with red or blue lettering.|$|E

In support of his [...] "buffalo-back" [...] hypothesis, Bailey argued that in Spinosaurus, Ouranosaurus, and other dinosaurs with long neural <b>spines,</b> <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> were relatively shorter and thicker than <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> of pelycosaurs (which were known to have sails); instead, <b>the</b> dinosaurs' neural <b>spines</b> were similar to <b>the</b> neural <b>spines</b> of extinct hump-backed mammals such as Megacerops and Bison latifrons.|$|R

5|$|The {{first stage}} in the {{management}} of a suspected spinal cord injury is geared toward basic life support and preventing further injury: maintaining airway, breathing, and circulation and immobilizing <b>the</b> <b>spine.</b>|$|E
5|$|The lumbar (or lower back) {{region is}} made up of five {{vertebrae}} (L1–L5), sometimes including the sacrum. In between these vertebrae are fibrocartilaginous discs, which act as cushions, preventing the vertebrae from rubbing together {{while at the same time}} protecting the spinal cord. Nerves come from and go to the spinal cord through specific openings between the vertebrae, providing the skin with sensations and messages to muscles. Stability of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> is provided by the ligaments and muscles of the back and abdomen. Small joints called facet joints limit and direct the motion of <b>the</b> <b>spine.</b>|$|E
5|$|The multifidus muscles run up {{and down}} along the back of <b>the</b> <b>spine,</b> and are {{important}} for keeping <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> straight and stable during many common movements such as sitting, walking and lifting. A problem with these muscles is often found in someone with chronic low back pain, because the back pain causes the person to use the back muscles improperly in trying to avoid the pain. The problem with the multifidus muscles continues even after the pain goes away, and is probably an important reason why the pain comes back. Teaching people with chronic low back pain how to use these muscles is recommended as part of a recovery program.|$|E
5|$|Daniela Schwarz {{and colleagues}} (2007) {{concluded}} that <b>the</b> bifurcated neural <b>spines</b> of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an air sac, {{which would have}} been connected to the lungs as part of the respiratory system. In Dicraeosaurus, this air sac (the so-called supravertebral diverticulum) would have rested on top of the neural arch and filled the entire space between <b>the</b> <b>spines.</b> In Amargasaurus <b>the</b> upper two-thirds of <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> would have been covered by a sheath of keratin, restricting the air sac to the space between the lower one-third of <b>the</b> <b>spines.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>spines</b> at <b>the</b> {{shoulder}} are curved to the rear, long, flattened, {{narrow and}} pointed.

A fourth <b>spine,</b> of about <b>the</b> same build but more forward-pointing, is present immediately behind the skull. In 2013 Sven Sachs and Jahn Hornung suggested a configuration {{in which there}} were five lateral neck <b>spines,</b> <b>the</b> new German <b>spine</b> having a morphology adapted to fit in the third position.|$|R
50|$|Clear {{oxygen-rich}} {{water is}} preferred by <b>the</b> <b>spined</b> loach, be it slowly flowing brooks, rivers or still water. They are found near flat and sandy or stony areas, frequently in large numbers. <b>The</b> <b>spined</b> loach is often kept as an ornamental fish in aquaria.|$|R
5|$|An {{intervertebral}} disc has a gelatinous core {{surrounded by a}} fibrous ring. When in its normal, uninjured state, most of the disc is not served by either the circulatory or nervous systems – blood and nerves only run {{to the outside of}} the disc. Specialized cells that can survive without direct blood supply are in the inside of the disc. Over time, the discs lose flexibility and the ability to absorb physical forces. This decreased ability to handle physical forces increases stresses on other parts of <b>the</b> <b>spine,</b> causing the ligaments of <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> to thicken and bony growths to develop on the vertebrae. As a result, there is less space through which the spinal cord and nerve roots may pass. When a disc degenerates as a result of injury or disease, the makeup of a disc changes: blood vessels and nerves may grow into its interior and/or herniated disc material can push directly on a nerve root. Any of these changes may result in back pain.|$|E
5|$|As the {{structure}} of the back is complex and the reporting of pain is subjective and affected by social factors, the diagnosis of low back pain is not straightforward. While most low back pain is caused by muscle and joint problems, this cause must be separated from neurological problems, spinal tumors, fracture of <b>the</b> <b>spine,</b> and infections, among others.|$|E
5|$|Eragon is a fifteen-year-old boy who {{has lived}} with his uncle Garrow and cousin Roran (Roran Stronghammer) on a farm {{near the village of}} Carvahall, ever since his mother Selena, Garrow's sister, left him there right after his birth. While hunting in <b>the</b> <b>Spine,</b> Eragon is {{surprised}} to see the blue dragon egg, which he believes to be a stone, appear in front of him. A few months later, Eragon witnesses a baby dragon hatch from the egg. Eragon names the dragon Saphira. He raises the dragon in secret until two of King Galbatorix's servants, the Ra'zac, come to Carvahall; though it is later revealed that they weren't looking for the egg at first. Eragon and Saphira manage to escape by hiding in <b>the</b> <b>Spine,</b> but Garrow is fatally wounded and the house and farm are burned down by the Ra'zac. Once Garrow dies, Eragon is left with no reason to stay in Carvahall, so he goes after the Ra'zac with his newly hatched dragon, seeking vengeance for the destruction of his home and his uncle's death. He is accompanied by Brom, an elderly storyteller, who provides Eragon with the sword Zar'roc and insists on helping him and Saphira.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{function}} {{and the appearance}} in life of the extremely elongated and bifurcated vertebral spines remain elusive. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> represented defense weapons against predators, arguing that they tapered towards their tips. In a subsequent skeletal reconstruction drawing, Salgado (1999) depicted <b>the</b> neural <b>spines</b> supporting a keratinous sheath, which could have added significantly to the total length of <b>the</b> <b>spines.</b> <b>The</b> presence of a covering, either of keratin or skin, is shown by a striation pattern {{on the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> similar to <b>the</b> bony horn cores of today's bovids. American science writer Gregory Paul (2000) argued that <b>the</b> <b>spines,</b> if elongated by a keratinous sheath, could have been used as a weapon both against predators and members of the same species, as the animal {{might have been able to}} point its most anterior spines forward by bending its neck. He also hypothesized that <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> could have been clattered together to generate sound. In 2016, Mark Hallett and Mathew Wedel suggested that <b>the</b> backwards-directed <b>spines</b> might have been able to skewer predators when the neck was abruptly drawn backwards during an attack. A similar defense strategy is found in today's giant sable antelope and Arabian oryx, which can use their long, backwards directed horns to stab attacking lions. Apart from the possible function in defense, <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> may have been used for display, either for the intimidation of rivaling individuals or for courtship. Hallett and Wedel also hypothesized that rival males might have interlocked their spines for neck wrestling.|$|R
