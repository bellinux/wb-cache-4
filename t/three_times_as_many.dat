With Gazzera's surrender, Gondar became the only area in Ethiopia that remained under Italian control. The market in Saïo was reopened three days after hostilities had ceased and Belgian engineers repaired the Saïo-Gambela road.|$|E
5|$|American Gangster was {{released}} in DVD and HD DVD format on February 19, 2008.

The film topped both the DVD sales charts with 4 million units during its first week in stores, more than <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> copies as second place Michael Clayton, and the rental charts. American Gangster ended up as the 14th best-selling DVD of 2008.

Tragic Kingdom was a massive commercial success, reaching sales of over 10 million in the United States and 16 million worldwide, peaking at number one on several charts and being certified Diamond (10,000,000 units) in the US and Canada and Platinum in the UK and Australia. This success created an extensive interest in the band's back catalog so, in October 1997, The Beacon Street Collection was re-released on Interscope.|$|E

5|$|The lack {{of record}} company support {{frustrated}} {{the band and}} led the band to self-produce their next album, The Beacon Street Collection, in a home-made studio, causing them {{to move away from}} the slick pop sound desired by Interscope and towards a more punk style. Their independence shocked their record company representative Tony Ferguson and the album sold over 100,000 copies in 1995, the year of its release, over <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> as No Doubt sold.

5|$|At Parc Cwm long cairn {{a variety}} of {{mortuary}} practices was evident and the deliberate ordering of skeletal parts noticeable. Whittle and Wysocki (1998) note cremated human remains were placed only in the front, right (southeast) chamber, where females and males, and all age ranges were represented. The southeast chamber was also unusual in that it contained nearly <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> individuals as {{in each of the}} other chambers, which contained the remains of all representative groups except younger children and infants. At the forecourt entrance Atkinson recorded finds, deposited in groups, including: flint debitage, lithic cores and a bladelet (burnt and unburnt); a leaf-shaped arrowhead (burnt); pieces of quartz; pieces of stalactite (now missing); sherds of Neolithic pottery; and cremated bone fragments. Atkinson speculated that the stalactite originated from Cat Hole cave, which (along with Tooth Hole cave) Whittle and Wysocki note as a possible source of the quartz too.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham's {{explosive}} {{industrial expansion}} started earlier {{than that of}} the textile-manufacturing towns of the North of England, and was driven by different factors. Instead of the economies of scale of a low-paid, unskilled workforce producing a single bulk commodity such as cotton or wool in large, mechanised units of production, Birmingham's industrial development was built on the adaptability and creativity of a highly paid workforce with a strong division of labour, practising a broad variety of skilled specialist trades and producing a constantly diversifying range of products, in a highly entrepreneurial economy of small, often self-owned workshops. This led to exceptional levels of inventiveness: between 1760 and 1850 – the core years of the Industrial Revolution – Birmingham residents registered over <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> patents as those of any other British town or city.|$|E

5|$|At the Battle of Breitenfeld, in 1631, Adolphus {{proved the}} {{effectiveness}} of the changes made to his army, by defeating Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly. Although severely outnumbered, the Swedes were able to fire between <b>three</b> and five <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> volleys of artillery, and their infantry's linear formations helped ensure they didn't lose any ground.

60|$|For {{the world}} is perpetually over-populated. It is not, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> good people fearfully imagine, on a half-comprehension of the Malthusian principle, shortly going to be over-populated; it is now, it has always been, and it will always be, pressed close up to the utmost {{possible}} limit of population. Reproduction is everywhere and in all species for ever outrunning means of subsistence; and starvation or competition is for ever keeping down {{the number of the}} offspring {{to the level of the}} average or normal supply of raw material. A single red campion produces in a year three thousand seeds; but there are not this year <b>three</b> thousand <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> red campions <b>as</b> there were last summer, nor will there be <b>three</b> thousand <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> more in the succeeding season. The roe of a cod contains sometimes nearly ten million eggs; but supposing each of these produced a young fish which arrived at maturity, the whole sea would immediately become a solid mass of closely packed codfish. Linnæus reckoned that if an annual plant had two seeds, each of which produced two seedlings in the succeeding season, and so on continually, in twenty years their progeny would amount to a million plants. A struggle for existence necessarily results from this universal tendency of animals and plants to increase faster than the means of subsistence, whether those means be food, as in the first case, or carbonic acid, water, and sunshine as in the second. Animals are all perpetually battling with one another for the food-supply of the moment; plants are perpetually battling with one another for their share of the soil, the rainfall, and the sunshine.|$|R

5|$|Soviet {{investment}} in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity, but {{in large part by}} the interests of massive party and state bureaucracies dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges. The Soviet Armed Forces became the largest in {{the world in terms of}} the numbers and types of weapons they possessed, in the number of troops in their ranks, and in the sheer size of their military–industrial base. However, the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West. For example, the Persian Gulf War demonstrated how the armor, fire control systems and firing range of the Soviet's most common main battle tank, the T-72, were drastically inferior to the American M1 Abrams, yet the USSR fielded almost <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> T-72's as the US deployed M1's.|$|E

The Town of Salem had sought {{to acquire the}} land, but the citizens rejected the plan three times and a state funded grant was rejected in 1994 after the DEP announced the interest in acquiring the property for the state. In 2008, the state spent about $1million to pave the boat launch area and improve parking for 54 vehicles. In 2012, the State of Connecticut was looking to institute parking fees for the park after it experienced several years of increased attendance and incidents in the park limits. Concerns included littering, unkempt toilets, swimmers going outside the designated zone and police arresting almost <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> visitors from 2011. In response to the issues, patrols were increased and additional signage was added to inform swimmers.
