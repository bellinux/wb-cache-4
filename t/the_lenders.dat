5|$|In a {{marathon}} meeting on 20/21 February 2012 the Eurogroup {{agreed with the}} IMF and the Institute of International Finance on the final conditions of the second bailout package worth €130 billion. <b>The</b> <b>lenders</b> agreed to increase the nominal haircut from 50% to 53.5%. EU Member States agreed to an additional retroactive lowering of the interest rates of the Greek Loan Facility {{to a level of}} just 150 basis points above Euribor. Furthermore, governments of Member States where central banks currently hold Greek government bonds in their investment portfolio commit to pass on to Greece an amount equal to any future income until 2020. Altogether this should bring down Greece's debt to between 117% and 120.5% of GDP by 2020.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of <b>the</b> <b>lenders,</b> meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory {{of interest is}} therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E
25|$|Often, {{instead of}} declaring insolvency, the company negotiates a debt {{restructuring}} with its lenders. The financial restructuring might entail that the equity owners inject some {{more money in}} the company and <b>the</b> <b>lenders</b> waive parts of their claims. In other situations, <b>the</b> <b>lenders</b> inject new money and assume the equity of the company, with the present equity owners losing their shares and investment. The operations of the company are not affected by the financial restructuring. Nonetheless, the financial restructuring requires significant management attention and may lead to customers losing faith in the company.|$|E

[...] Interest paid represents compensation {{for the use of}} <b>the</b> <b>lender’s</b> money or property and thus represents profit or an accession to wealth to <b>the</b> <b>lender.</b> Interest income can be attributed to <b>lenders</b> even if <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> doesn’t charge a minimum amount of interest.|$|R
50|$|The PMI company insures a {{percentage}} of the consumer's loan to reduce <b>the</b> <b>lender's</b> risk; this percentage is paid to <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> if <b>the</b> consumer does not pay and <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> forecloses <b>the</b> loan.|$|R

25|$|Conversely, the law harmed <b>the</b> <b>lenders</b> {{who would}} never be {{reimbursed}} once the Sabbatical year ended to remit all debts. The wealthy refused to loan money during the latter years of the seven-year cycle, refusing the poor even a temporary opportunity to make ends meet.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>lenders</b> (the {{people who}} put up the $9bn in the example) can insure against default by syndicating the loan to spread the risk, or by buying credit default swaps (CDSs) or selling {{collateralised}} debt obligations (CDOs) from/to other institutions (although this is no business of the private equity firm).|$|E
25|$|To induce {{subscription}} to the loan, the subscribers {{were to be}} incorporated {{by the name of}} the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. The Bank was given exclusive possession of the government's balances, and was the only limited-liability corporation allowed to issue bank notes. <b>The</b> <b>lenders</b> would give the government cash (bullion) and issue notes against the government bonds, which can be lent again. The £1.2m was raised in 12 days; half of this was used to rebuild the navy.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} an economy where a lender finances loans by issuing a securitized product, and where credit {{quality of the}} product depends on <b>the</b> <b>lender’s</b> screening effort. Under asymmetric information between <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> and investors about the credit quality of potential borrowers, overvaluation of the low-quality securitized product may occur, inducing <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> to not screen the borrowers and to issue a securitized product of low credit quality. A minimum-retention-ratio regulation on <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> is not necessarily effective in solving this incentive problem. Even worse, such retention regulation may discourage <b>the</b> <b>lender’s</b> screening effort and reduce welfare...|$|R
25|$|In a Colorado case, a {{distinction}} argued by defendants {{resulted in the}} judge relying on a more expansive reading of Schmuck to deny their motion to dismiss the indictment. The government had alleged that, {{as part of a}} mortgage fraud scheme, the deeds and deeds of trust mailed to <b>the</b> <b>lenders</b> by the county recorder's office constituted mail fraud. The defendants countered that, under Colorado law, deeds took effect once they were executed, so the mailing of the documents was not necessary to their scheme.|$|E
25|$|The English {{had found}} the Antwerp money market short of funds since earlier in the year, and now made use of Cologne and Augsburg as well, but as events {{unfolded}} in the next year, and the personal position of some leading lenders became precarious, the English found to their surprise that repayments were no longer pressed for, probably as <b>the</b> <b>lenders</b> were happy to keep their money abroad on loan to a secure borrower. The Dutch Revolt, which from 1585 onwards included a Dutch blockade of the River Scheldt leading to the city, was to finally destroy Antwerp as a major trading centre.|$|E
25|$|Ground broke on the Rose Garden in 1993, and the {{building}} opened two years later in 1995. The Rose Garden cost $262 million to build, $155 million of which was financed through a loan from a consortium of lenders led by pension fund TIAA-CREF. As Allen was unwilling to personally guarantee the loan, <b>the</b> <b>lenders</b> demanded an interest rate of 8.99%, with no opportunity for prepayment. Other major creditors included Prudential Insurance, and Farmers Insurance. A shell corporation, the Oregon Arena Corporation (OAC), was chartered to oversee the construction and operation of the Rose Garden, as well as operation of the Rose Quarter as a whole. The sole shareholder in OAC was Allen.|$|E
30|$|We setup <b>the</b> <b>lender’s</b> {{decision}} problem as follows. Suppose a lender {{has access to}} a homogenous population and wishes to market credit offers. Since the population is a homogenous population, we {{do not include the}} characteristic vector x in our analysis. <b>The</b> <b>lender</b> is required to decide whether to market or not to the population on the ith instance in a sequence of offers. If <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> decides to market on the ith instance then <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> is required to set the ith offer rate with a single objective of maximizing expected profit. <b>The</b> <b>lender</b> also has access to a historical database of similar homogenous consumer population with information on sequence of past offers and the respective consumers’ decisions on those credit offers.

25|$|On February 13, 2009, {{the company}} {{declared}} Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Young cancelled a planned auction of all 10 of its stations {{five months later}} on July 14 at the last minute, a move {{believed to have been}} made {{due to a lack of}} suitable bids. Instead of auctioning off the stations, Young and its secured lenders reached a deal where <b>the</b> <b>lenders</b> (among them Wachovia and Credit Suisse) would take control of the company, and Gray Television would manage seven of Young's ten stations. KRON, WATE-TV in Knoxville, Tennessee and WLNS-TV in Lansing, Michigan (the latter two, unlike KRON, compete with Gray-owned stations in their respective markets) were the only stations not included in the management deal.|$|E
25|$|The {{bankruptcy}} declaration was {{the beginning}} of a year-long dispute between Philadelphia Media Holdings and its creditors. The group of creditors, which include banks and hedge funds, wanted to take control of Philadelphia Newspapers LLC themselves and opposed efforts by Philadelphia Media Holdings to keep control. Philadelphia Media Holdings received support form most of the paper's unions and launched a public-relations campaign to promote local ownership. A bankruptcy auction was held on April 28, 2010. The group of lending creditors and a group of local investors allied with Brian Tierney both bid for Philadelphia Newspapers, but <b>the</b> <b>lenders</b> had the winning bid. On May 21, Brian Tierney stepped down as CEO of Philadelphia Media Holdings and was replaced by Joseph Bondi, the company's restructuring adviser.|$|E

50|$|In some situations, <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> can {{actually}} repledge or sell the collateral the borrower used {{to secure the}} loan from <b>the</b> <b>lender.</b> In this instance, the borrower continues to recognize the receivables as an asset on the borrower's balance sheet, and <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> only records <b>the</b> liability associated with the obligation to return the asset.|$|R

25|$|After a seven-month process, the Rangers' {{bankruptcy}} was finalized by an August 5 auction for {{ownership of}} the team by two parties, Rangers Baseball Express led by Ryan and Greenberg, and a partnership of Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and Crane. The auction was delayed by several hours due to objections raised by Greenberg and Ryan's group questioning the qualification of the Cuban-Crane bid, which was due no later than 8:00 pm on August 3. The auction, which was due to begin at 9:00 am on August 4, did not have its first opening bid determined until 2:50 pm. After {{no more than three}} bids by each party, Cuban withdrew from the bidding, and Greenberg and Ryan were declared the winners shortly after midnight. Due to the auction process, the purchase was for only the MLB club and the lease for the ballpark. Almost none of the original side deals with HSG and Hicks, which were rejected by several of <b>the</b> <b>lenders</b> to the Texas Rangers, were included.|$|E
500|$|The first {{review of}} the bailout {{programme}} carried out by Greece's lenders stalled in February 2016 over pension reforms. Speaking to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Tsakalotos urged <b>the</b> <b>lenders</b> to complete the review by 1 May as [...] "This question of time is important {{if we want to}} move from a vicious to a virtuous circle." [...] He wrote to other members of the Eurogroup on 6 May to appeal for their support against extra demands for austerity that, he argued, were beyond the mandate of the Greek government.|$|E
500|$|The {{financing}} {{of the construction}} of the facility was widely hailed at the time as a good example of public-private partnership; most of the costs were borne by Allen and/or Allen-owned companies, rather than by taxpayers. [...] The bulk of the $262million construction costs were funded by a $155million loan from a consortium of lenders led by pension fund TIAA-CREF. [...] As Allen was unwilling to guarantee the loan with his personal finances, <b>the</b> <b>lenders</b> demanded an interest rate of 8.99%, with no opportunity for prepayment. [...] Other major creditors included Prudential Insurance, and Farmers Insurance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{borrower}} has {{two separate}} agreements. One with <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> for <b>the</b> mortgage {{and one with}} the insurer for the endowment policy. The arrangements are distinct and the borrower can change either arrangement if they wish. In the past the endowment policy was often taken as an additional security by <b>the</b> <b>lender.</b> That is, <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> applied a legal device to ensure the proceeds of the endowment were made payable to them rather than the borrower; typically the policy is assigned to <b>the</b> <b>lender.</b> This practice is uncommon now.|$|R
25|$|Like other ARMs, hybrid ARMs {{transfer}} some interest-rate {{risk from}} <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> to <b>the</b> borrower, thus allowing <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> {{to offer a}} lower note rate in many interest-rate environments.|$|R

500|$|A {{consortium}} of the publishers of the rivals of the [...] Illustrated Daily News offered $150,000 {{to buy the}} paper, intending to shut it down.

[...] The stockholder's committee got the Vanderbilt family to sign over a $1million note so that they could top the rival bid, and raised $30,000 for a month's payroll. Boddy and Lewis both served on the Commercial Board, a group of young businessmen; the new publisher got Board members to lend him $116,000 to buy a controlling interest in the paper, but if the paper did not show a profit within six months, ownership would go to <b>the</b> <b>lenders.</b> Boddy once commented, [...] "The Daily News was conceived in iniquity, born in bankruptcy, reared in panic, and refinanced every six months." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Philadelphia Media Holdings' acquisition, The Inquirer saw larger than expected revenue losses, mostly from national advertising, and continued loss of circulation. The revenue losses caused management to cut four hundred jobs at The Inquirer and Daily News {{in the three years}} since the papers were bought. Despite efforts to cut costs, Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on February 21, 2009. Philadelphia Media Holdings was about US$390 million in debt, due to money borrowed to buy The Inquirer and Daily News. The bankruptcy {{was the beginning of a}} year-long dispute between Philadelphia Media Holdings and its creditors. The group of creditors, which included banks and hedge funds, wanted to take control of Philadelphia Newspapers LLC themselves and opposed efforts by Philadelphia Media Holdings to keep control.

The deal fell through after the group of lenders, under the name of Philadelphia Media Network (PMN), was unable to reach a contract agreement with the union representing the company's drivers. Philadelphia Newspapers, represented by Lawrence G. McMichael of Dilworth Paxson LLP, challenged the right of creditors to credit bid at a bankruptcy auction.
