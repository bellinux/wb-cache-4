5|$|The fight {{began with}} a {{flagrant}} foul by Knicks guard Mardy Collins on Nuggets guard J. R. Smith in the closing seconds of the game. Several players joined in the confrontation, and began to make physical contact. The fight briefly spilled into the stands, and also stretched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> of the court. All ten players {{on the floor at}} the time were ejected after the altercation was finished. When suspensions were announced, seven players were suspended without pay for a combined total of 47 games.|$|E
5|$|Gordon escapes the {{destroyed}} lab. Surviving staff {{tell him}} that communications {{with the outside world}} have been cut and urge him to head to the surface. Gordon fights his way through Black Mesa, defending himself against hostile Xen creatures — such as Vortigaunts and parasitic headcrabs, which attach themselves to human hosts — and US marines sent to cover up the incident. At the surface, Gordon learns that scientists from the Lambda Complex may have a way to close the portal. Gordon travels <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> of the facility to assist them. Along the way, he activates a rocket engine test facility to destroy a giant tentacled creature and uses a disused railway system to reach and launch a satellite rocket. After he is captured by Black Ops and left for dead in a garbage compactor, he escapes and makes his way to an older part of the facility, where he discovers Xen specimens collected before the resonance cascade.|$|E
5|$|In 1864 Brookwood (Necropolis) {{railway station}} on the LSWR opened, {{immediately}} east of Necropolis Junction. In conjunction with {{the building of the}} station a run-around loop was added at Necropolis Junction, allowing locomotives to reposition themselves from the front {{to the rear of the}} train. From then on, on arrival at Necropolis Junction from London the engine would not be repositioned, but would push the train into the cemetery from the rear, under the close supervision of LNC staff. This left the engine positioned to pull the train out of the cemetery, after which it would use the run-around loop to move <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> of the train and pull it back to London. Between 1898 and 1904 the LSWR line through Brookwood was increased from two to four tracks; a thin slice of the northernmost part of the cemetery was ceded to the LSWR to allow the widening of the line. Brookwood station was rebuilt, and a new junction to the west of the station allowed trains to pass between the cemetery branch and all four of the LSWR lines.|$|E

5|$|The Kokinshū, Tales of Ise and Tales of Yamato all {{describe}} Narihira leaving Kyoto {{to travel}} east through the Tōkaidō region and crossing the Sumida River, composing poems at famous places (see utamakura) along the way. The Tales of Ise implies this journey {{was the result}} of the scandalous affair between Narihira and Fujiwara no Takaiko. There are doubts as to whether this journey actually took place, from the point of view both that the number of surviving poems is quite small for having made such a trip and composing poems along the way, and in terms of the historical likelihood that a courtier could have gone wandering <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> of the country with only one or two friends keeping him company.|$|E
5|$|The LSWR M7 {{class is}} {{a class of}} 0-4-4 {{passenger}} tank locomotive built between 1897 and 1911. The class was designed by Dugald Drummond for use on the intensive London network of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), and performed well in such tasks. Because of their utility, 105 were built and the class went through several modifications over five production batches. For this reason there were detail variations such as frame length. Many of the class were fitted with push-pull operation gear that enabled efficient use on branch line duties without the need to change <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> of its train {{at the end of}} a journey.|$|E
5|$|The {{second day}} started {{dramatically}} when Halcombe bowled {{from the opposite}} end and bowled the second over of the day, with Lonergan standing at square leg. His first ball was deemed to be legitimate but from then on there was a continuous call of no ball, for ten consecutive deliveries. Halcombe then substantially reduced his pace and completed the over after 18 balls. Although Bryant did not switch Halcombe <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> in the first match, he did so on this occasion. Halcombe continued bowling {{and there were no}} further no ball calls. During the ten consecutive no balls, Lonergan had remained firm despite continuous heckling from a section of the crowd who showed their support of the bowler. Halcombe persevered and ended the innings with 3/61 from 20 overs. His action was much discussed, in particular his faster ball. The opening batsmen Rushforth and Atkinson played Halcombe in a diplomatic manner, making little effort to attack his bowling {{in the midst of the}} throwing calls.|$|E
5000|$|After Constantius' {{death in}} 361, his {{successor}} Julian, a devotee of Rome's pagan gods, {{declared that he}} would no longer attempt to favor one church faction over another, and allowed all exiled bishops to return; this resulted in further increasing dissension among Nicene Christians. The Emperor Valens, however, revived Constantius' policy and supported the [...] "Homoian" [...] party, exiling bishops and often using force. During this persecution many bishops were exiled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>ends</b> of <b>the</b> Empire, (e.g., St Hilary of Poitiers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Eastern provinces). These contacts and the common plight subsequently led to a rapprochement between the Western supporters of the Nicene creed and the homoousios and the Eastern semi-Arians.|$|R

25|$|A study {{conducted}} by Datta indirectly supports the idea that memory benefits from sleep. A box was constructed wherein a single rat could move freely {{from one end to}} the other. The bottom of the box was made of a steel grate. A light would shine in the box accompanied by a sound. After a five-second delay, an electrical shock would be applied. Once the shock commenced, the rat could move <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> of the box, ending the shock immediately. The rat could also use the five-second delay to move <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> of the box and avoid the shock entirely. The length of the shock never exceeded five seconds. This was repeated 30 times for half the rats. The other half, the control group, was placed in the same trial, but the rats were shocked regardless of their reaction. After each of the training sessions, the rat would be placed in a recording cage for six hours of polygraphic recordings. This process was repeated for three consecutive days. During the posttrial sleep recording session, rats spent 25.47% more time in REM sleep after learning trials than after control trials.|$|E

25|$|Kicks in play can, if successful, {{result in}} rapid field advancement.

25|$|The {{most common}} poly{{histidine}} tags are formed of six histidine (6xHis tag) residues - which are added at the N-terminus preceded by Methionine or C-terminus before a stop codon, in the coding {{sequence of the}} protein of interest. The choice of the end where His-tag is added will depend mainly {{on the characteristics of}} the protein and the methods chosen to remove the tag. Some ends are buried inside the protein core and others are important for the protein function or structure. In those cases the choice is limited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end.</b> On the other hand, most available exopeptidases can only remove the His-tag from the N-terminus; removing the tag from the C-terminus will require the use of other techniques. It is important to take into account that the computer simulation (by molecular dynamic) will help you to choose between options, for example, whether the His-tag must be digested or engineered to the N- or C-terminal.|$|E
500|$|Pitch was a base {{ingredient}} in many incendiary devices throughout the period.

5000|$|A {{significant}} {{aspect of}} KQ6 story and gameplay is the option for <b>the</b> player <b>to</b> receive different endings based on choices {{made during the}} course of the game.

Upon completing either path, the player is given a clue about what choices would have led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>ending.</b> In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> two main paths and endings, the game's endings also contain many minor variables based on optional tasks in the game that the player may or may not have performed.

500|$|At the time, the {{alteration}} to the no-ball law {{made by the}} Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1899 was yet to {{be implemented}} in Australian first-class cricket. This change allowed the umpire to call a throw from either end, whereas the law previously barred the umpire at square leg from doing so. The non-implementation of the law diluted the power of Australian umpires, since the bowler could be switched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> and made immune from being called by the first umpire. As a result, Gregory's unwillingness to switch Marsh to the opposite end surprised cricket observers. Australian administrators had been under pressure from England {{to crack down on}} dubious bowling actions. English captain Archie MacLaren had asserted that [...] "If Australia expects an English team next September they will have to play according to the new reading of the law at home". It was speculated that because Crockett was a lifelong employee of the Melbourne Cricket Club, which organised and sponsored English tours to Australia, he was under pressure to no-ball bowlers in order to curry favour with English administrators.|$|E
