5|$|Brolgas are {{omnivorous}} and forage in {{wetlands and}} saltwater marshes. They <b>tear</b> <b>up</b> {{the ground with}} their powerful beaks in search of bulbs and edible roots. Northern populations mainly eat tubers of the bulkuru sedge (Eleocharis dulcis) which they extract by digging holes in the mud, {{but these are not}} available south of Brisbane. They also eat the shoots and leaves of wetland and upland plants, cereal grains, seeds, insects, mollusks, crustaceans, frogs and lizards. In saltwater marshes they may drink saline water and they have glands near their eyes through which they can excrete excess salt.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Eugene and Jonathan Coachman. The match started with Eugene hitting an arm drag on Coachman and hitting {{numerous}} headbutts. An unknown {{woman in a}} bikini {{came out to the}} ringside area with some cookies, Coachman offered cookies to Eugene. The woman lured Eugene out of the ring and Eugene went over and grabbed some cookies. As Eugene went to grab more cookies, Coachman slammed Eugene's head into the cookie tray. A spot in the match saw Garrison Cade come out to ringside with a stuffed animal, which prompted Cade to <b>tear</b> <b>up</b> said toy animal. Cade tried to hold Eugene so Coachman could get the advantage, however, Eugene was able dodge the attack, as Coachman ended up hitting Cade instead. Eugene Rock bottomed Coachman and pinned him for the win.|$|E

5|$|The {{corridor}} {{through which}} MT 287 passes {{was part of}} two migration routes along which settlers rushed to attempt to make their fortunes during the Alder Gulch gold rush that started in 1863. Virginia City {{was the target of}} both routes; the new town became the second capital of the Montana Territory in 1865. Settlers from the east followed the Bozeman Trail through Wyoming and eastern Montana, including the namesake city, and settlers from the south used the Virginia City branch of the Montana Trail from Utah and Idaho. After 10 years, the initial gold boom had ended, and the territorial capital moved to Helena in 1875. A second period of gold extraction came {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, when mechanical gold dredges arrived to <b>tear</b> <b>up</b> Alder Gulch to gather more gold. Gold dredge placer mining and some lode mining formed the basis of the area's economy until the gold ore was mostly exhausted; the dredge tailings along Alder Gulch remain a visible reminder of the area's mining past.|$|E

5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{momentum}} continued {{one week}} later in Korea, winning his third consecutive race and taking a six-point championship lead as Fernando Alonso finished third. Vettel overcame pole-sitter Mark Webber at the start, and was aided in building up a lead by first-lap contact between Jenson Button, Nico Rosberg and Kamui Kobayashi that saw Button and Rosberg retire with damage from the collision; Rosberg pulled over on the approach to the third turn, forcing a protracted yellow flag period as marshalls attempted to retrieve his car. With the sporting regulations banning overtaking while yellow flags were shown, the field was effectively thinned out in the opening laps as drivers were unable to pass one another. Tyre management {{became the focus of}} the race, as drivers reported heavy graining, particularly on the right-front tyre, which bore most of the load over a lap of the circuit. Vettel ignored six radio calls from his pit wall cautioning him that a tyre failure was imminent, only backing off just enough in the final few laps to secure victory over Webber by six seconds. The team later denied that there had ever been a problem with Vettel's tyres. Further down the order, Scuderia Toro Rosso's Jean-Éric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo fought their way from sixteenth and twenty-first on the grid to finish eighth and ninth, while Romain Grosjean drove a conservative race to finish seventh, having been warned beforehand by the stewards that another first-lap altercation would likely result in his disqualification from the race. Lewis Hamilton's day went from bad to worse when an anti-roll bar on his McLaren failed, while the car handled its tyres so poorly that he was forced to make an unscheduled stop {{in order to make it}} to the finish, only to <b>tear</b> <b>up</b> a length of astroturf that wreaked havoc on his downforce and he slid down to tenth place, narrowly fending off an opportunistic charge from Sergio Pérez to take the final World Championship point on offer. Button's retirement and Hamilton's single point meant that McLaren lost second place in the World Constructors' Championship to Ferrari, and Hamilton admitted that his bid to be the 2012 World Drivers' Champion was over.|$|E

25|$|In March 1959, BEA, {{which had}} become {{concerned}} by a recent decline in passenger growth, concluded that the D.H.121's payload-range capacity could be too great for their needs and petitioned de Havilland to reduce {{the scale of the}} design to suit their revised projections. Fearing that the proposed scale of the Trident was too large, the airline had elected to effectively <b>tear</b> <b>up</b> the programme for its redesigning for their immediate situation. In 1959, BEA had a large fleet in operation and on order, and the issue of overcapacity was a critical concern. The airline's concerns reflected three factors: a short-lived airline recession in the late 1950s; the imminent arrival into service of a large fleet of turboprop Vickers Vanguards which duplicated the D.H.121's general payload-range area, and the growing trend to higher-density seating.|$|E
25|$|The {{next decade}} brought the United States Football League (USFL), which played its {{season in the}} spring instead of autumn. After three seasons of play during which it never had {{the same number of}} teams and many franchises moved, it also filed an {{antitrust}} suit it had brought against the NFL. Seeking {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} and damages, USFL v. NFL centered around the NFL's television contracts, and in addition to the financial damages, it also sought to invalidate the league's contracts with at least one of the Big Three television networks that dominated U.S. TV at the time. The jury concluded that the NFL was indeed violating antitrust laws but refused to <b>tear</b> <b>up</b> the broadcast contracts (noting that a last-ditch effort to move the league's season to autumn forced out numerous major market teams that would have made a television package more appealing) and only awarded a token $3 judgment in the USFL's favor. The failure to secure either objective in the lawsuit, coupled with mounting debts, prompted the USFL to cease operations.|$|E
25|$|Three of {{the trains}} were {{captured}} by four men of Company K, 2nd New York Cavalry Regiment, who rode {{up to the}} train engineers and ordered them to surrender, which they did since only a few Confederate engineers of Colonel T. M. R. Talcott's command were the only soldiers near the station. In {{his account of the}} battle, Colonel Alanson Merwin Randol commanding the 2nd New York Cavalry said that the cars had been partially unloaded and were preparing to move away when Custer ordered Randol to capture the trains. The locomotive and one or two cars of one of the trains escaped toward Lynchburg before Custer's men could <b>tear</b> <b>up</b> the track in front of it to prevent its escape. The remaining car or cars of that train were burned. After Randol's men stopped the three other trains from getting away, they gathered both white and black prisoners, many from Confederate quartermaster and commissary details.

25|$|The Days of Rage {{took place}} {{shortly after the}} June Convention, during {{the second week of}} October that fall. Taking place once again in Chicago, they were a {{consequence}} of the Weatherman faction seizing control of the student-run organization and convincing the group as a whole for the need of a full-fledged revolution. During the Days of Rage, “young radicals invested militant action with special power to enlighten, inspire, and mobilize”. This event “provided a way for them to establish the authenticity of their commitments, to assert their dissident or ‘revolutionary’ identities, and to live what they considered meaningful and engaged lives. The Weathermen had anticipated “at least 25,000 people” were to attend the Days of Rage; however, “instead of the promised 25,000 white youth ready to <b>tear</b> <b>up</b> ‘pig city,’” a mere “700 to 800 people gathered” half of them spectators. The four-day spectacle opened the Weathermen’s eyes to the fact that because of their tactics, they would not gain the support that they had originally intended on gathering.|$|E
25|$|Jackson reached Bristoe Station on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad {{during the}} {{afternoon}} of the 26th, where his troops proceeded to wreck two trains and <b>tear</b> <b>up</b> several miles of tracks. When he learned that there was a Union supply depot at Manassas Junction several miles to the northeast, Jackson detached the brigade of Isaac R. Trimble along with cavalry support to capture the junction. After a night march Trimble launched an attack which overran the small Union garrison, capturing over 300 prisoners and eight cannons, at the loss of four men. After receiving word of the Confederate attack on Manassas Junction during the night, Pope tried to launch several Union columns against Jackson's wing in order to surround the Confederates. He started the Army of Virginia marching northeast towards Manassas and ordered detachments from the Union forces in Washington to move by railroad westward to Manassas. The brigades of George W. Taylor and E. Parker Scammon started on the morning of August 27. Meanwhile, Jackson left Richard S. Ewell's division at Bristoe's Station to watch for Union forces and moved A. P. Hill's and William B. Taliaferro's divisions to reinforce Trimble's brigade.|$|E
