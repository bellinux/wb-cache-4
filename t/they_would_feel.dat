The airline also sent its own team of caregivers and volunteers {{and agreed to}} bear the expense of bringing {{family members of the}} passengers to Kuala Lumpur and providing them with accommodation, medical care, and counselling. Altogether, 115 family members of the Chinese passengers flew to Kuala Lumpur. Some other family members chose to remain in China, fearing <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> too isolated in Malaysia.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{beginning}} of the war, shelter policy had been determined by Sir John Anderson, then Lord Privy Seal and, on the declaration of war, Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security. Anderson announced the policy to Parliament on 20 April 1939, based on a report from a committee chaired by Lord Hailey. This reaffirmed a policy of dispersal and eschewed the use of deep shelters, including the use of tube stations and underground tunnels as public shelters. Reasons given were the spread of disease due to the lack of toilet facilities at many stations, the inherent danger of people falling onto the lines, and that people sheltering in the stations and tunnels might be tempted to stay in them day and night because <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> safer there than outside the stations.|$|E
500|$|The most {{controversial}} move was Hitchcock's [...] "no late admission" [...] {{policy for the}} film, which was unusual for the time. It was not entirely original as Clouzot {{had done the same}} in France for Diabolique. Hitchcock thought that if people entered the theater late and never saw the star actress Janet Leigh, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> cheated. At first theater owners opposed the idea, claiming that they would lose business. However, after the first day, the owners enjoyed long lines of people waiting to see the film.|$|E

Sri insults Supono's bravery, saying that he would never do it; Aminah feels the same about Mahmud. Ultimately the sisters decide to answer together, both expressing approval. Hearing this, Mahmud and Supono leave their hiding places and shout [...] "Live, Srikandi of Indonesia!" [...] The four are excited, and Sri and Supono prepare for a quick wedding. Aminah and Sri's parents, however, are frightened upon hearing that the men will join PETA.|$|E
500|$|Wealth {{and goods}} became game rewards {{during the last}} decades of the 19th century with the winner of McLoughlin Brothers' The Game of Playing Department Store, for instance, being [...] the player who {{carefully}} spent his money accumulating the most goods in a department store. Bulls and Bears: The Great Wall St. Game promised players <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> like [...] "speculators, bankers, and brokers", and the 1885 catalog advertisement for McLoughlin Brothers Monopolist informed the interested, [...] "On this board the great struggle between Capital and Labor can be fought out {{to the satisfaction of}} all parties, and, if the players are successful, they can break the Monopolist and become Monopolists themselves".|$|E
500|$|By 1790, it {{had become}} common for {{children}} to come to Morris's house for instruction and access to his library. Morris welcomed all of these students, both male and female. Morris's coeducation caused some stir within the community when some claimed that his education of women was [...] "'blowing up their pride' so that 'they would feel themselves above their mates and <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> above labour.'" [...] In 1794, these frustrations were brought to fruition when a hearing {{was held in the}} church. The charges were dismissed and the publicity from the controversy brought so much attention, that, by 1803, he had instructed students [...] "from all the New England States except Rhode Island, and from the States of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia. Also from the Island of St. Thomas in the West Indies, and from the Island of Bermuda." ...|$|E

500|$|The Beatles {{played at}} the opening of the Casbah Coffee Club on 29 August 1959, which was in the cellar of Mona Best's house. Aspinall later rented a room in the house and became very good friends with then-Beatle Pete Best. The Beatles had {{previously}} used public transport to get to local gigs, but by February 1961, they were playing two or three concerts per night at different locations and needed someone to drive them. Best asked Aspinall to be a part-time road manager for the band, so Aspinall bought an [...] "old, grey and maroon Commer van" [...] for £80, and charged each of the group five shillings (25p) per concert. Harrison later said: [...] "Our early van became the centre of attention every time it pulled up. It was brush-painted red and grey and from head to foot was covered in graffiti – girls' names, and things like 'I love you, John'. It looked interesting, but the moment anybody saw it <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> free to write all over it.” The Beatles returned from their second trip to Hamburg in July 1961, and Aspinall left his job to become their permanent road manager, as he was earning more money driving them around than he was earning by being an accountant.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the episode}} was {{completed}} in the Upper Boat Studios, particularly the interior car scenes. For this, only one car set was used, with it being redecorated for each different car. The cars were decorated to look like they had been lived in, and incorporated futuristic and well-known home objects. Brannigan and Valerie's children were played by real kittens, which proved difficult to direct. The production team shot for four days in the [...] "6-foot by 6-foot" [...] car, which Davies called a [...] "nightmare" [...] because not many camera angles were available and only one crew member could adjust the props and lighting at a time. In addition, smoke was generated around the car so it would {{blend in with the}} CGI smoke from the CGI cars. The small set was intended to benefit the actors, as <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> claustrophobic. For the scene in which the Doctor jumps from car to car, the underside of a car was built and suspended ten to fifteen feet above the top of the car set with a green screen all around to get as many angles as possible. Davies preferred action sequences that moved up and down, a scale that is not seen much on television. The Temple of Peace in Cardiff was the location for the Darkened Temple, as well as the TV Studio with news reporter Sally Calypso. The production team spent two days filming there, on 18 and 19 September 2006. The undercity where the Doctor and Martha arrive was filmed at the Cardiff Bay maltings and the Ely Papermill, which were designed to look in disrepair. The artificial rain proved difficult in some shots, as the production team had trouble getting one of the side walls wet.|$|E

His {{children}} will not inherit {{a significant proportion of}} his wealth.

Using a questionnaire, 123 boys and 138 girls, aged 13 to 17, imagined that two close friends had performed better or worse than them in five domains. They then rated how much <b>they</b> <b>would</b> care, <b>feel</b> {{and think about the}} unequal outcomes, that were of equal value to both genders. They were also asked to rate how they felt the friends <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> towards them. Overall, girls' reactions to the inequality were more negative than boys'.

2500|$|In reality, Smith was {{discontent with}} only a few colonists who acted this way; he [...] "claimed the early colonists were heroes. His primary purpose in writing The Generall Historie...was to eternalise 'the memory of those that effected' the {{settlement}} of Virginia". Smith {{goes so far as to}} compare the colonists to Adam and Eve in A Description of New England (1616). Just as Adam and Eve spread productivity throughout the world, so the colonists created life in the Virginia colony. Smith essentially sympathized with gentlemen; he knew that it was not their fault that they were useless and that this trait was merely a product of the imposed standards of English society. He recognized that [...] "they were imprisoned by their own self-imposed limitations. What they could and could not do was decided by their awareness of traditional roles and by the shame that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> if others saw them engaged in physical work". Lemay suggests that, as a result of Smith's strict rules and the emigration to America, these men could shed these roles and create new lives for themselves in which they could celebrate the products of their labours and not feel humiliated.|$|E
