5|$|Major {{accidents}} are investigated {{by an independent}} agency, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board (NTSB) {{concluded}} that the crash {{was caused by the}} captain's improper execution of an instrument approach, combined with a severe downdraft at a low altitude, which resulted in the aircraft descending uncontrollably into terrain.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the flight crew's operation of the airplane below the minimum descent altitude without an appropriate visual reference for the runway.|$|E

5|$|The {{accident}} was investigated by <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board (NTSB). The Flight Data Recorder was recovered intact from the wreckage, but the Cockpit Voice Recorder had been damaged in the post-crash fire and was unusable.|$|E
5|$|According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Cirrus SR20 aircraft, tail number N929CD, {{was owned}} by Lidle. On May 1, 2007, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board (NTSB) stated that the {{probable}} cause of the crash was pilot error. The NTSB was unable to determine which person was flying the aircraft {{at the time of}} the crash.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{the pilot}} in command, {{according}} to the cockpit voice recorder transcript, the first officer was the pilot flying {{at the time of}} the accident. In <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board report on the crash, investigators concluded that the likely cause of the crash was pilot error.|$|E

25|$|Worried {{about the}} criticism, Congress passed <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Capital <b>Transportation</b> Act of 1960, which {{established}} <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Capital <b>Transportation</b> Agency (NCTA) {{to plan for}} both mass transit and new highways in the District of Columbia. The legislation also placed a moratorium on any highway or bridge construction west of 12th Street NW until July 1, 1965.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> U.S. <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board sent a team {{to support}} the Colombian-led {{investigation}} as representatives of the manufacturer's state.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board {{investigated}} {{the accident and}} published a detailed final report eleven months later on March 11, 1997. From the official point of view, the pilot in command was flight instructor Reid, who {{was the only one}} on board rated to fly the aircraft. The investigation focused on his decision-making prior to takeoff and his actions once airborne.|$|E
5|$|The {{same week}} as the {{memorial}} dedication, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board held hearings related to another fatal incident in the Metro system, one which happened earlier in 2015; the juxtaposition of the two events was noted by some commentators.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed the aircraft had impacted birds during take-off. Due to {{loss of power}} in the left engine, the flight crew were unable to control their aircraft before it struck the roof of the apartment building. The investigation further determined the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and officials at DeKalb–Peachtree Airport were aware of the danger of birds at the airport after a landfill site had opened {{in the vicinity of the}} airport ten years before the accident.|$|E
25|$|As of January, 2007, <b>the</b> U.S. <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board {{database}} lists 19 fatal accidents for the 35/35A, and {{two for the}} 36/36A.|$|R

5|$|In April 2007, {{acting on}} a {{recommendation}} made by <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board (NTSB) during its investigation of Comair 5191, the FAA issued a safety notice that reiterated advice to pilots to positively confirm their position before crossing the hold-short line onto the take-off runway, and again when initiating takeoff. And in May, {{acting on a}}nother NTSB recommendation, the FAA advised that pilot training should include specific guidance on runway lighting requirements for take-off at night.|$|E
5|$|June 20, 1998: A Greyhound bus on a {{scheduled}} trip from New York City to Pittsburgh ran off a road near Burnt Cabins, Pennsylvania, {{and hit a}} truck parked in an emergency parking area. Six passengers and the driver died. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was the driver's use of a sedating antihistamine and driver fatigue, due to an irregular work-rest schedule.|$|E
5|$|Kulwicki {{died in an}} {{airplane}} crash on Thursday April 1, 1993. He was returning from an appearance at the Knoxville Hooters in a Hooters corporate plane on a short flight across Tennessee before the Sunday spring race at Bristol. The plane slowed and crashed just before final approach at Tri-Cities Regional Airport near Blountville. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board attributed the crash to the pilot's failure to use the airplane's anti-ice system to clear ice from the engine inlet system.|$|E
50|$|He has {{retired from}} the Department of Transportation as a Senior Scientist, Air and Space Transportation Safety at <b>the</b> Volpe <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Systems Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts.|$|R
50|$|In 2012 <b>the</b> U.S. <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board {{stated the}} Enbridge {{oil spill in}} the Kalamazoo River near Marshall was the costliest onshore cleanup in U.S. history.|$|R

5|$|May 13, 1972: Near Bean Station, Tennessee, between Knoxville and Bristol, a Greyhound Scenicruiser on a {{scheduled}} trip from Memphis to New York City collided head-on with a tractor-trailer truck. The {{driver of the}} bus had begun to pass a car. Fourteen people, including both the bus and truck drivers, died. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board determined {{that the cause of}} the crash was the Greyhound driver's overtaking maneuver and his failure to avoid the truck.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of December 9, 2016, Sherman died when his Zenair CH 601 Zodiac crashed outside of Marengo, Illinois. He was 63. He was flying {{from his home in}} Poplar Grove to Schaumburg Regional Airport to attend a holiday party. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board {{determined}} that Sherman's plane lost control soon after taking off, and that it crashed around 6:19 p.m. on December 9. Federal Aviation Administration records also showed that Sherman had a sport pilot certificate, meaning that by flying at night, he was violating the restrictions on his license.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{aircraft}} had departed from U.S. soil and U.S. nationals {{had died in}} the incident, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board (NTSB) was legally required to investigate. On the morning of September 1, the NTSB chief in Alaska, James Michelangelo, received an order from the NTSB in Washington {{at the behest of the}} State Department requiring all documents relating to the NTSB investigation to be sent to Washington, and notifying him that the State Department would now conduct the investigation.|$|E

50|$|The U.S. Federal Railroad Administration was {{the lead}} agency in the {{investigation}} of the accident. <b>The</b> U.S. <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board contributed with a detailed analysis of the tank car performance.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the flight crew members' failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane's location on the airport surface during taxi and their failure to cross-check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's nonpertinent conversations during taxi, {{which resulted in a}} loss of positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration's failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances.|$|E
5|$|After initial {{analysis}} {{determined that}} Flight370's last location was within Australia's Search and Rescue {{region in the}} southern Indian Ocean, Australia has {{played a major role}} in co-ordinating the analysis in conjunction with Malaysia. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) is responsible for the search for Flight370 and has brought together a team of experts to determine the location of Flight370 at the 08:19 communication. The team brought together by the ATSB includes the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, Boeing, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (Australia), Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation, Inmarsat, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board (US), and Thales.|$|E
5|$|During the Blizzard of 1996, on January 6, a Metro {{operator}} {{was killed}} when a train failed {{to stop at the}} Shady Grove station. The four-car train overran the station platform and struck an unoccupied train that was awaiting assignment. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> Safety Board (NTSB) investigation found that the crash was a result of a failure in the train's computer-controlled braking system. The NTSB recommended that Metro grant train operators the ability to manually control the braking system, even in inclement weather, and recommended that Metro prohibit parked rail cars on tracks used by incoming outbound trains.|$|E
