5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>intrinsic</b> magnetic moment, Ganymede has an induced dipole magnetic field. Its existence {{is connected with}} the variation of the Jovian magnetic field near Ganymede. The induced moment is directed radially to or from Jupiter following {{the direction of the}} varying part of the planetary magnetic field. The induced magnetic moment is an order of magnitude weaker than <b>the</b> <b>intrinsic</b> one. The field strength of the induced field at the magnetic equator is about 60 nT—half of that of the ambient Jovian field. The induced magnetic field of Ganymede is similar to those of Callisto and Europa, indicating that Ganymede also has a subsurface water ocean with a high electrical conductivity.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of <b>the</b> <b>intrinsic</b> {{magnetic}} field on Venus, the solar wind penetrates relatively deep into the planetary exosphere and causes substantial atmosphere loss. The loss happens mainly via the magnetotail. Currently the main ion types being lost are O+, H+ and He+. The ratio of hydrogen to oxygen losses is around 2 (i.e. almost stoichiometric) indicating the ongoing loss of water.|$|E

These were demonstrated at The Mother of All Demos in 1968. Engelbart's Law, the observation that <b>the</b> <b>intrinsic</b> rate of human performance is exponential, is named after him.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{systems are}} {{areas of the}} brain that are {{involved}} in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. <b>The</b> <b>intrinsic</b> spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} self-calibration and motion recovery for turntable sequences. Previous works exploited silhouette correspondences induced by epipolar tangencies to estimate the image invariants under turntable motion and recover the epipolar geometry. These approaches, however, require <b>the</b> camera <b>intrinsics</b> {{in order to obtain}} an Euclidean motion, and a dense sequence is required to provide a precise initialization of the image invariants. This paper proposes a novel approach to estimate <b>the</b> camera <b>intrinsics,</b> <b>the</b> image invariants and the rotation angles from a sparse turntable sequence. The silhouettes and a single point correspondence are extracted from the image sequence. The point traces out a conic in the sequence, from which the fixed entities (i. e., the image of the rotation axis, the horizon, the vanishing point of the coordinates, the circular points and a scalar) can be recovered given a simple initialization of <b>the</b> camera <b>intrinsic</b> matrix. <b>The</b> rotation angles are then recovered by estimating the epipoles that minimize the transfer errors of the outer epipolar tangents to the silhouettes for each pair of images. <b>The</b> camera <b>intrinsics</b> can be further refined by the above optimization. Based on a given range of the initial focal length, a robust method is proposed to give the best estimate of <b>the</b> camera <b>intrinsics,</b> <b>the</b> image invariants, the full camera positions and orientations, and hence a Euclidean reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the simplicity of this approach and the accuracy in the estimated motion and reconstruction. ...|$|R

After defining various aspects and relationships of literature in general, Wellek and Warren divide analysis of literature based on two approaches: extrinsic, relating to factors outside a work such as the author and society, and intrinsic, relating to factors within such as rhythm and meter. They stress the {{need to focus on}} <b>the</b> <b>intrinsic</b> elements of a work as the best way to truly understand it. In doing so they adapt the phenomenology used by Roman Ingarden.|$|E
5|$|The band {{structure}} of carbon nanotubes having certain (n,m) indexes {{can be easily}} calculated. A theoretical graph based on this calculations was designed in 1999 by Hiromichi Kataura to rationalize experimental findings. A Kataura plot relates the nanotube diameter and its bandgap energies for all nanotubes in a diameter range. The oscillating shape of every branch of the Kataura plot reflects <b>the</b> <b>intrinsic</b> strong dependence of the SWCNT properties on the (n,m) index rather than on its diameter. For example, (10,1) and (8,3) tubes have almost the same diameter, but very different properties: the former is a metal, but {{the latter is a}} semiconductor.|$|E
5|$|The {{enzymology}} of proteases {{provides some}} of the clearest known examples of convergent evolution. The same geometric arrangement of triad residues occurs in over 20 separate enzyme superfamilies. Each of these superfamilies is the result of convergent evolution for the same triad arrangement within a different structural fold. This is because there are limited productive ways to arrange three triad residues, the enzyme backbone and the substrate. These examples reflect <b>the</b> <b>intrinsic</b> chemical and physical constraints on enzymes, leading evolution to repeatedly and independently converge on equivalent solutions.|$|E

The ventrally positioned photophores serve to disrupt its silhouette from below by matching the downwelling light, a strategy known as counter-illumination, that is common among bioluminescent organisms of the mesopelagic zone. The individual photophores are set around the denticles and are small enough that they cannot be discerned by the naked eye, suggesting they have evolved to fool animals with high visual acuity and/or at close distances.|$|E
