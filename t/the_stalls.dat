5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stalls</b> and pews in the crossing, by Seddon, {{are similar}} to the pews in the nave (being of pitch pine with pegged tenon joints) but are more ornate, with open-arcaded front kneelers and two reading desks with triple pointed arches to the fronts and {{scrolled}} tops to the uprights.|$|E
5|$|The two-story {{interior}} {{space on the}} first floor was originally used for carriages and then for automobiles, and now is used as an indoor exercising ring for the horses occupying <b>the</b> <b>stalls</b> below. In the end pavilions, there is a reception area, tack room, and small apartment designed to be occupied by the riding instructor.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper floor}} of this {{building}} was the reredorter or latrine. It is a large room with a door conveniently leading into the monks' dormitory. <b>The</b> <b>stalls</b> were in the south wall and the effluent dropped into an underground stream which runs in a vaulted passage underneath the building.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigated unsteady {{events such}} as stall inception, stall-cell development, and surge. Stall {{is characterized by a}} decrease in overall pressure rise and nonaxisymmetric throughflow. Compressor stall can lead to surge which is characterized by quasi-axisymmetric fluctuations in mass flow and pressure. Unsteady measurements of the flow field around the compressor rotor are examined. During <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> inception process, initial disturbances were found within the rotor passage near the tip region. As <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> cell develops, blade lift and pressure ratio decrease within <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> cell and increase ahead of <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> cell. <b>The</b> <b>stall</b> inception event, stall-cell development, and stall recovery event were found to be nearly identical for stable rotating stall and surge cases. As <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> cell grows, <b>the</b> leading edge of the cell will rotate at a higher rate than the trailing edge in the rotor frame. The opposite occurs during <b>stall</b> recovery. <b>The</b> trailing edge of <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> cell will rotate at the approximate speed as <b>the</b> fully developed <b>stall</b> cell, while <b>the</b> leading edge decreases in rotational speed in the rotor frame...|$|R
50|$|One {{symptom of}} an {{approaching}} stall is slow and sloppy controls. As {{the speed of the}} aircraft decreases approaching <b>the</b> <b>stall,</b> there is less air moving over the wing, and, therefore, less air will be deflected by the control surfaces (ailerons, elevator, and rudder) at this slower speed. Some buffeting may also be felt from the turbulent flow above the wings as <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> is reached. <b>The</b> <b>stall</b> warning will sound, if fitted, in most aircraft 5 to 10 knots above <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> speed.|$|R
5|$|Although superficially {{the market}} {{remained}} little {{changed in the}} decades following the 1930s redevelopment, by the 1960s it was falling into disrepair, and it no longer met modern hygiene regulations. A lack of funds delayed improvement works, and renovation works did not begin until February 1976. Hot and cold running water and refrigeration were provided to those stalls handling food, and many of <b>the</b> <b>stalls</b> were converted into lockable units. New electrical mains cables were installed throughout the market, the site was resurfaced, and the elegant but ageing 19thcentury lavatories were demolished. Aside from the demolition of the Victorian toilets, the only significant visible alteration was the addition of corrugated plastic covers over the walkways between <b>the</b> <b>stalls.</b> Although competition from supermarkets was by this time affecting shopping patterns, {{and the decline of}} market gardening meant a virtual end to stall-holders selling their own produce, the market survived competitive pressures. Many stalls diversified into specialist foods, clothing and other goods and the high number of stalls allowed the market to sell a range of goods as great as that provided by the supermarkets.|$|E
5|$|Another similar rags-to-riches {{story is}} Pang Lim, {{who was an}} illegal fruit hawker in Sungei Road in the 1970s. His big break came when he saved enough money to rent a coffee shop in 1990 with his younger brother and uncle. They rented <b>the</b> <b>stalls</b> out to other hawkers and managed the drinks stall themselves. The {{business}} took off and from one coffee shop, Pang is now the managing director of Koufu, which operates 20 foodcourts, five coffee shops and five cafes around the island.|$|E
5|$|The Sibu Night Market was {{established}} in 1973. It was situated in the town centre. Local traders will usually set up their mobile stalls from 5pm to 10pm every day. <b>The</b> <b>stalls</b> offer household goods, footwear, fashion items, and varieties of food. In August 2012, the market was relocated to Butterfly Garden at Cross Road near the Tua Pek Kong Temple to ease traffic jams.|$|E
500|$|In fact, some {{theoretical}} models incorporate a hydrodynamical instability in <b>the</b> <b>stalled</b> shock {{known as the}} [...] "Standing Accretion Shock Instability" [...] (SASI). This instability comes about {{as a consequence of}} non-spherical perturbations oscillating <b>the</b> <b>stalled</b> shock thereby deforming it. The SASI is often used in tandem with neutrino theories in computer simulations for re-energizing <b>the</b> <b>stalled</b> shock.|$|R

5|$|The organ was {{originally}} built in 1685 by Renatus Harris {{at a cost}} of £500. This has been removed and repaired many times. However, some of the original work, including the case and pipes, is incorporated into the present instrument, which was built by J. W. Walkers & Sons in 1907, to be found above <b>the</b> <b>stalls</b> {{on the north side of}} the choir. It was further restored in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the death}} of a Knight, the banner, helm, {{mantling}} and crest (or coronet or crown) are taken down. The stall plates, however, are not removed; rather, they remain permanently affixed somewhere about the stall, so that <b>the</b> <b>stalls</b> of the chapel are festooned with a colourful record of the Order's Knights (and now Dames) throughout history.|$|E
5|$|While the 1976 renovations {{prolonged}} {{the life}} of the 1930s market, by the 1990s the market was once more becoming decrepit. The covers erected in 1976 over the walkways blocked sunlight, leaving much of the market dingy and poorly lit. The walkways themselves, already narrow, were becoming even more restricted as stalls erected external displays and additional weatherproofing. Removable shutters used to secure <b>the</b> <b>stalls</b> overnight were stacked against the sides of <b>the</b> <b>stalls</b> during trading hours, causing further obstruction, while on those stalls fitted with doors the doors opened outwards to maximise the limited space inside the units. In addition, the floors of stalls followed the slope of the hill, a gradient of about 1:12, causing health problems for those market workers who had to stand at this angle for prolonged periods during the day. Norwich City Council decided that these problems needed to be addressed, and in December 2003 invited the public to choose between three proposals for a rebuilt market.|$|E
5000|$|An {{aerodynamic}} twist can {{be introduced to}} the wing with the leading edge near the wing tip twisted downward. This is called washout and causes the wing root to <b>stall</b> before <b>the</b> wing tip. This makes <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> gentle and progressive. Since <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> is delayed at the wing tips, where the ailerons are, roll control is maintained when <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> begins.|$|R

Also, the Emerson String Quartet, a quartet who also {{contribute}} to the Department of Music perform multiple times a year. In front of <b>the</b> <b>Staller</b> Center, <b>the</b> <b>Staller</b> steps serve as a gathering place throughout the spring for many students wishing to socialize.|$|R
50|$|At {{an angle}} of attack above about 15° many {{airfoils}} enter <b>the</b> <b>stall.</b> Modification of such an airfoil with a fixed leading edge slot can increase <b>the</b> <b>stalling</b> angle to between 22° and 25°.|$|R
5|$|Ravenscroft {{commissioned}} the architect Thomas Edward Knightley {{to design the}} new hall. Using a floor plan previously prepared by C. J. Phipps, Knightley designed a hall with a floor area of 21,000 square feet (2,000 m²) and an audience capacity of 2,500. Contemporary newspapers commented on the unusual elevation of the building, with the grand tier at street level, and <b>the</b> <b>stalls</b> and arena downstairs. The exterior carving was by Sidney W. Elmes and Son, and the furnishing was by Lapworth Brothers and Harrison. The lighting {{was a combination of}} gas and electricity.|$|E
5|$|Shrimp, {{chicken and}} lemon-filled briouats are another {{traditional}} specialty of Marrakesh. Rice is cooked with saffron, raisins, spices, and almonds, while couscous may have added vegetables. A pastilla is a filo-wrapped pie stuffed with minced chicken or pigeon {{that has been}} prepared with almonds, cinnamon, spices and sugar. Harira soup in Marrakesh typically includes lamb with a blend of chickpeas, lentils, vermicelli, and tomato paste, seasoned with coriander, spices and parsley. Kefta (mince meat), liver in crépinette, merguez and tripe stew are commonly sold at <b>the</b> <b>stalls</b> of Jemaa el-Fnaa.|$|E
5|$|The British {{arrival in}} Jerusalem heralded a {{rational}} philosophy of infrastructure planning and development. It respected cultural and historic heritage {{and attempted to}} preserve such elements within the blossoming construction of the modern city. The city walls were identified as such an element, so British workers acted to clear away <b>the</b> <b>stalls</b> on their perimeter and maintain an open area between {{the walls and the}} rest of the New City in the interest of an aesthetically pleasing visual basin. By the same token, planners demolished the Ottoman clock tower to preserve a historic skyline.|$|E
50|$|Any {{swept wing}} {{tends to be}} {{unstable}} in <b>the</b> <b>stall,</b> since <b>the</b> rearward end <b>stalls</b> first causing a pitch-up force worsening <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> and making recovery difficult. This effect is more significant with forward sweep because the rearward end is the root and carries greater lift.|$|R
50|$|In consequence, <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> warning came on {{whenever}} the pilot pushed {{forward on the}} stick and then stopped when he pulled back; This happened several times during <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> and this may have confused the pilots.|$|R
40|$|Stall flutter is an {{aeroelastic}} phenomenon resulting in unwanted oscillatory loads on the blade, such as wind turbine blade, helicopter rotor blade, and other flexible wing blades. Although <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> flutter and related aeroelastic control {{have been studied}} theoretically and experimentally, microtab control of asymmetric limit cycle oscillations (LCOs) in stall flutter cases has not been generally investigated. This paper presents an aeroservoelastic model to study the microtab control of the blade section undergoing moderate stall flutter and deep <b>stall</b> flutter separately. <b>The</b> effects of different dynamic <b>stall</b> conditions and <b>the</b> consequent asymmetric LCOs for both stall cases are simulated and analyzed. Then, {{for the design of}} <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> flutter controller, <b>the</b> potential sensor signal for <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> flutter, <b>the</b> microtab control capability of <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> flutter, and <b>the</b> control algorithm for <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> flutter are studied. The improvement and the superiority of <b>the</b> proposed adaptive <b>stall</b> flutter controller are shown by comparison with a simple stall flutter controller...|$|R
5|$|The {{building}} {{dates from}} the 14thcentury, although a number of changes have since been made, particularly a substantial 19th-century restoration by SirGeorge Gilbert Scott. The church and its octagonal tower are built in red sandstone. Features of the church's interior include the lierne-vaulted ceiling of the choir, the carved stone canopies of the sedilia in the chancel, and the intricately carved wooden canopies over the choirstalls together with the 20misericords {{at the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>stalls.</b> The church is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield and the deanery of Nantwich.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} incorporated {{many modern}} features, such as sound-proofing and under-seat heating, {{and it was}} also the first cinema in Britain to make use of concealed neon lighting. It had a seating capacity of 1,400 in <b>the</b> <b>stalls</b> and 600 in the circle, with a further 146 seats in the café area. When built, the cinema had a short pedestrian approach to the facade, but this was removed when the A56 was widened. During the Second World War the building was used for concerts, including one given by a young Julie Andrews. It also played host to the Hallé Orchestra after the orchestra's own home, the Free Trade Hall, was bombed and severely damaged during the Manchester Blitz of 1940.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the death}} of a Knight, helm, mantling, crest (or coronet or crown) and sword are taken down. The stall plates, however, are not removed; rather, they remain {{permanently}} affixed {{to the back of the}} stall, so that <b>the</b> <b>stalls</b> of the chapel are festooned with a colourful record of the Order's Knights (and now Ladies) since 1911. The entryway just outside the doors of the chapel has the names of the Order's Knights from before 1911 inscribed into the walls giving a complete record of the members of the order.|$|E
5000|$|On June 11, 2007, Craig {{was arrested}} at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport on {{suspicion}} of lewd conduct. The nature of the alleged activity has been categorized by some as cottaging. According to the police report, the police officer sat in a bathroom stall {{as part of an}} undercover operation investigating complaints of sexual activity in the restroom. After about 13 minutes of sitting in <b>the</b> <b>stall,</b> <b>the</b> police officer observed Craig lingering outside and frequently peeking through the crack of the door on <b>the</b> <b>stall.</b> Craig then entered <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> to <b>the</b> left of <b>the</b> officer's <b>stall.</b> <b>The</b> police officer made the following observations, which he recorded in his report of the incident, as to what happened next: ...|$|R
50|$|Horses {{normally}} enter {{from the}} rear of <b>the</b> <b>stall,</b> with gates locked behind the horse once it is in place; the front gates of <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> are normally closed as the horse is loaded in, though the starting-gate crew may open it in order to entice a horse who balks at entry. Alternately, a horse may be backed into <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> from <b>the</b> front entry, again done {{in the case of a}} skittish horse.|$|R

5|$|Following the First World War, {{the local}} {{authority}} began to systematically buy up all <b>the</b> <b>stalls</b> on the market, eventually bringing the entire market into public ownership. It was radically redesigned in the 1930s: stalls were arranged into parallel rows {{and a new}} City Hall was built along the entire {{western side of the}} marketplace to replace the by then inadequate Guildhall. This new arrangement survived with few significant changes {{for the rest of the}} 20thcentury. By the 1990s, the market was becoming decrepit and, in 2003, proposals were made for another radical rebuilding of the area. These proposals were extremely controversial and were abandoned in 2004 in favour of a scheme which retained the parallel rows of stalls, but replaced the old stalls with steel units of four stalls each. The rebuilt market was completed in early 2006 and is one of the largest markets in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s saw the {{increased}} use of audio cassettes and videotapes for the dissemination of bootleg recordings, as the affordability of private dubbing equipment made the production of multiple copies significantly easier. Cassettes were also smaller, easier to ship, and could be sold or traded more affordably than vinyl. Cassette culture and tape trading, propelled by the DIY ethic of the punk subculture, relied on an honour system where people who received tapes from fellow traders made multiple copies to pass on to others within the community. For a while, stalls at major music gatherings such as the Glastonbury Festival sold mass copies of bootleg soundboard recordings of bands who, in many cases, had played only a matter of hours beforehand. However, officials soon began to counteract this illegal activity by making raids on <b>the</b> <b>stalls</b> and, {{by the end of the}} 1980s, the number of festival bootlegs had consequently dwindled.|$|E
5|$|The £3million {{refurbishment}} by Fry, {{the most}} extensive programme of work since the theatre had been saved from virtual collapse almost 30 years before, included an expanded foyer, improved lift and disabled access to <b>the</b> <b>stalls</b> and royal circle levels, complete refurbishment of the bars {{and the creation of}} The Jeremy Fry Bar, in the former cellars of The Garrick's Head pub, and redecoration of the auditorium. Technical improvements included the rebuilding of the Main House stage, and an extensive rewiring and lighting programme around the entire building, with new fire alarm systems, air-conditioning and lighting, all designed to improve the building's efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint by some 30%. The design was by architects of the Fielden Clegg Bradley Studios, and the construction firm Midas was contracted to complete the building work.|$|E

40|$|With some {{airplanes}} {{the approach}} to <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> is accompanied by changes in the behavior, such as tail buffeting or changes in the control characteristics of the airplane so that the pilot obtains a warning of <b>the</b> impending <b>stall.</b> Vith other airplanes {{it is possible to}} approach <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> without any perceptible warning other than the reading of the air-speed meter, in which case the danger of inadvertent stalling is considerably greater. Although it is not within the scope of this paper to discuss stalling characteristics, it is desired to point out that in general the danger of inadvertent stalling is greatest with those airplanes that behave worse when <b>the</b> <b>stalling</b> occurs; that is, with airplanes in which <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> starts at <b>the</b> wing tips. A warning of <b>the</b> impending <b>stall</b> is desirable in any case, but is particularly desirable with airplanes of the latter type...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{problems}} confronting the designer of a dairy barn {{is to determine the}} proper length of <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> platform. Cows vary considerably in length, and <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> length should vary to to meet the requirements of individual cows. Stalls that are too short make uncomfortable beds, force the cows to stand with one or both hind feet in the gutter and cause them, in reaching for hay in the manger, to carry manure to <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> floor. Long stalls are equally objectionable as the droppings fall on the platform rather than in the gutter. Adjustable stanchions are available but not in general use. Where installed, the tendency is to set adjustable stanchions at the time of installation and not change them as the occupants of <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> change. Even with adjustable stanchions it would seem desirable to make <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> length approximate <b>the</b> needs of the herd...|$|R
