40|$|Abstract: The {{combustion}} behavior <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> components <b>of</b> MSW {{was examined}} with a thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA). The experiments were {{done over the}} temperature range of room temperature to 1000 ºC at a heating rate of 10 ºC/min and in an oxidizing atmosphere. The {{results indicated that the}} entire weight loss process <b>of</b> each <b>typical</b> component <b>of</b> MSW consists of one to three distinct combustion stages. The combustion <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> components <b>of</b> MSW could be modeled by one to three independent reactions. The corresponding parameters <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> components <b>of</b> MSW such as activation energy, pre-exponential factor, and reaction order were determined. The calculated results using the comprehensive kinetic model composed of one to three independent and consecutive reactions, agreed well with experimental results...|$|R

5|$|Cholesterol {{levels may}} be {{determined}} {{as part of}} health screening for health insurance or occupational health, when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma, xanthoma, arcus are noticed, symptoms of cardiovascular disease develop, or a family member {{has been found to}} have FH. A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of total cholesterol, markedly raised level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), normal level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and normal level of triglycerides. Total cholesterol levels of 350–550 mg/dL are <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> heterozygous FH while total cholesterol levels of 650–1000 mg/dL are <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E

40|$|A {{group of}} 406 Polish {{university}} students (210 women and 196 men) {{were asked to}} describe <b>typical</b> representatives <b>of</b> selected ethnic groups and their typical female and male members. The descriptions were based on a list of 24 traits and a list of 18 values, accompanied by scales for measuring trait-typicality and value-importance. The participants' level of confidence about the accuracy of the descriptions, their ethnic attitudes and their perception of the relative social status {{of men and women in}} ethnic groups were also measured. The results indicate an effect of masculinisation of ethnic images for both traits and values. Descriptions <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> representatives <b>of</b> ethnic groups resemble the images <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> men significantly more than those <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> women <b>of</b> these nationalities, even for the most modern nations. Differences registered between images <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> representatives <b>of</b> ethnic groups and their male and female members concerned primarily the traits and values basic to gender stereotypes. The images of women were significantly more favourable than those of men. The bias in ethnic perception towards the gender of the stereotype-holder was also indicated. Several differences were found between women's and men's perception <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> representatives <b>of</b> ethnic groups and especially of ethnic gender subgroups, without however the predicted effect of gender in-group favouritism. There was also a degree of ethnic in-group favouritism of Poles related to the gender both of participants and of the ethnic target groups...|$|R
