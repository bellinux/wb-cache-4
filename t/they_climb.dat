5|$|Carless {{makes an}} {{impressive}} speech in Persian {{to convince the}} drivers to continue into Nuristan. <b>They</b> <b>climb</b> an extremely indistinct track to the pass. They descend into Nuristan: it grows hot. Men run to meet them: they are told {{they are the first}} Europeans ever to cross the pass (Newby doesn't believe this). They are given ice-cold milk to drink.|$|E
5|$|In {{an unusual}} case, planidium larvae of some beetles {{of the genus}} Meloe form a group and produce a {{pheromone}} that mimics the sex attractant of its host bee species. When a male bee arrives and attempts to mate with the mass of larvae, <b>they</b> <b>climb</b> onto his abdomen. From there, they transfer to a female bee, {{and from there to}} the bee nest to parasitize the bee larvae.|$|E
5|$|A mountainside, at the magician's cavern. Goffredo and Eustazio {{are told}} by the Magician that Almirena is being held captive in Armida's palace at the mountain-top. Ignoring the magician's warning that they will need special powers, the pair set off for the palace but are quickly driven back by Armida's monsters. The magician then gives them magic wands that transcend Armida's power, and they set off again. This time they {{overcome}} the monsters, but as they reach {{the gates of the}} palace it disappears, leaving them clinging to a rock {{in the midst of a}} stormy sea. <b>They</b> <b>climb</b> the rock and descend out of sight.|$|E

5|$|The two are chased into a cinema where <b>they</b> <b>climb</b> {{out onto}} the marquee and have a brief {{standoff}} with the police. Homer gives a heartfelt speech to justify Larry's actions and Mr. Burns forgives them for the hoax, but explains he cannot be the family whom Larry needs. Larry understands and announces {{that he has a}} wife and children back home who are probably worrying about him. Burns and Larry say their goodbyes and the people of Springfield party outside the cinema.|$|E
5|$|<b>They</b> <b>climb</b> {{the tower}} and come to another door; inside lies a second world {{surrounded}} by large bodies of water. By navigating caves, they find a floating island which allows them to travel around the world by air. They locate an old man, Ryu-O, and solve his riddle to obtain the Airseed, allowing them to breathe underwater and enter the undersea palace. They encounter the second fiend, Sei-ryu; they defeat him and recover half of the second sphere. Upon returning to Ryu-O, he reveals himself to be the guardian of {{the other half of}} the sphere, and the two halves form the Blue Sphere.|$|E
5|$|<b>They</b> <b>climb</b> up and {{eventually}} reach a small abandoned house. While there, {{the man is}} attacked by a big cat, which the woman strikes away {{with a piece of}} wood. The man is unscathed, but the woman sustains a wound to her leg, which they wrap with a flag brought from when they were creating the sand castle. Deciding that traveling in search of people towards the top of the mountain, where they see a structure, would be a better medical option than heading back home, they continue towards the mountaintops. As night falls, they rest in the wild. The man takes the first guard shift, and the stars in the night sky time lapse behind him. He wakes the woman to take his turn to sleep. When he eventually wakes up, the two characters press on with the intention of turning back if they do not find people.|$|E

5|$|Climbing the tower, {{the party}} discovers {{the remains of}} a family that {{attempted}} to reach Paradise but failed, and a library suggesting Ashura is controlled by someone else. They encounter him at the top, guarding the final door; he offers each of them control of one of the worlds, but they refuse and defeat him. Before they can pass through the door, a trap drops them to the bottom floor. Encountering the allies they made along their journey, they decide to rescale the tower. As <b>they</b> <b>climb</b> stairs that wrap outside of the tower, they engage each of the fiends revived and defeat them. They find the Creator at the summit, and learn that the fiends and the tower itself are actually part of a game created by him to see heroes defeat evil; for succeeding they would be granted a wish as a reward. Angry at his manipulation, they reject the reward and challenge the Creator, who insists that because he created everything he was allowed to use them as he saw fit. They then attack and defeat the Creator in a fierce battle. The heroes then discover a door leading to an unknown location; they consider entering, but decide to return to their own world.|$|E
25|$|Security Chief Harry Jernigan and Roberts rescue Mueller and {{the family}} from 87. Jernigan gets the mother out safely but Roberts, Mueller, and the two {{children}} are halted by a collapsed stairwell. <b>They</b> <b>climb</b> down the stairs but fire forces {{them up to the}} Promenade Room. Electrical power is lost and O'Halloran's men are forced to rappel down an elevator shaft.|$|E
25|$|The {{trails of}} the park are {{maintained}} by volunteers from the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference, which also publishes detailed maps. Some follow, in whole or part, old woods roads {{left over from the}} quarrying and mining operations; at other times <b>they</b> <b>climb</b> the steep and rocky peaks directly. They are blazed with NYSOPRHP plastic disks, except for the Appalachian Trail which uses white paint blazes.|$|E

25|$|Lophospermum {{species are}} {{herbaceous}} perennial climbers with fibrous roots. <b>They</b> <b>climb</b> {{by means of}} twining leaf stalks (petioles) rather than tendrils or twining stems. The long stems are branched, becoming woody at the base with age. In some species the stems grow from a woody caudex – a swollen, bulb-like structure {{at the base of}} the stem. The leaves are triangular or heart-shaped with a pointed apex and toothed edges (crenate or dentate). Both stems and leaves may have a purplish colour.|$|E
25|$|Jack, Roderick, and Roderick's {{attendant}} Wicke {{volunteer to}} join the king's knights, led by Elmont and his second in-command, Crawe, and climb the beanstalk in search of Isabelle. As <b>they</b> <b>climb,</b> Roderick and Wicke cut the safety rope, intentionally killing some of the knights. At the top, they discover the giants' realm and decide to split into two groups: one with Jack, Elmont, and Crawe, and the other including Roderick and Wicke, but not before Roderick forcibly takes the remaining beans from Jack (although Jack manages to save one for himself).|$|E
25|$|The female lays her fertilised eggs on the ground, {{near the}} nest of a ground-nesting solitary bee. The larvae are very active {{as soon as}} they hatch. <b>They</b> <b>climb</b> a {{flowering}} plant and await the arrival of a solitary bee. They hook themselves on to the bee using the three claws on their legs that give the first instar larvae their name, triungulins (from Latin tri, three, and ungulus, claw). The bee carries the larvae back to its nest, where they feed on bee larvae and the bees' food supplies. The larvae are thus somewhere between predators and parasites. The active larvae moult into very different, more typically scarabaeoid larvae for the remaining two or more instars, in a development type called hypermetamorphosis. The adults emerge from the bees' nest and fly to the woody plants on which they feed.|$|E

25|$|A Tyrannosaurus threatens Ann, but Kong kills {{it after}} a colossal battle by {{breaking}} its neck and jaw. Driscoll continues to shadow Kong and Ann while Denham returns to the village for more men. Upon arriving in Kong's lair in a mountain cave, Ann is menaced by a snake-like Elasmosaurus, which Kong wrestles and kills. While Kong is distracted killing a Pteranodon that tried to fly away with Ann, Driscoll reaches her and <b>they</b> <b>climb</b> down a vine dangling from a cliff ledge. When Kong notices and starts pulling them back up, they let go and fall unharmed into the water below. They run through the jungle {{and back to the}} village, where Denham, Englehorn and the surviving crewmen are waiting. Kong, following, breaks open the gate and murderously rampages through the village. On shore, Denham, now determined to bring Kong back alive, knocks him unconscious with a gas bomb.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} night of the quest, the entire company is {{captured}} by three trolls, who plan to eat them. However, Gandalf arrives, imitating the trolls' voices and causing them to fight amongst themselves until the sun rises, which turns them to stone. As Bilbo searches for supplies in their cave, he meets an injured elf, Lianna (Jennifer Hale), who he assists by finding her healing potion. He also finds a dagger, which he calls Sting. The party then move on to the Elven city of Rivendell, where Elrond tells them of a secret entrance into the Lonely Mountain. They then head to the Misty Mountains. During the night, they are attacked by goblins, and Bilbo is knocked unconscious. He awakens alone and lost. As he wanders through the underground passages, he finds a ring, and encounters a creature named Gollum (Daran Norris). Gollum makes a deal with Bilbo; they will play a game of riddles. If Gollum wins, he will eat Bilbo, but if Bilbo wins, Gollum will show him the way out. Bilbo wins the game, and Gollum says he must get something before he can lead Bilbo out. He then realizes his ring is gone. Bilbo puts the ring on and discovers it makes its wearer invisible. An infuriated Gollum runs to the exit to try to stop Bilbo leaving, unwittingly leading the invisible Bilbo out. He reunites with the dwarves and Gandalf, but the party are then attacked by a groups of goblins and wargs. <b>They</b> <b>climb</b> to the tops of the trees, and are rescued by a band of eagles, who drop them off near Mirkwood Forest.|$|E
25|$|Adult sloth bears may {{travel in}} pairs, with the males being gentle with cubs. They may fight for food. They {{walk in a}} slow, shambling motion, with their feet being set down in a noisy, {{flapping}} motion. They are capable of galloping faster than running humans. Although they appear slow and clumsy, both young and adult sloth bears are excellent climbers. <b>They</b> <b>climb</b> to feed and to rest, though not to escape enemies, as they prefer to stand their ground. Sloth bear mothers carry cubs up to 9 months old on their backs instead of sending their cubs up trees as the primary defense against attacks by predators, such as tigers, leopards, and other bears. They are capable of climbing on smooth surfaces and hanging upside down like sloths. They are good swimmers, and primarily enter water to play. To mark their territories, sloth bears scrape trees with their forepaws, and rub against them with their flanks. Sloth bears have a great vocal range. Gary Brown, in his Great Bear Almanac, lists over 25 different sounds in 16 different contexts. Sounds such as barks, screams, grunts, roars, snarls, whickers, woofs, and yelps are made when angered, threatening, or when fighting. When hurt or afraid, they shriek, yowl, or whimper. When feeding, sloth bears make loud huffing and sucking noises, which can be heard over 100 m away. Sounds such as gurgling or humming are made by bears resting or sucking their paws. Sows emit crooning sounds to their cubs. The species is the most vociferous when mating, and make loud, melodious calls when doing so. Sloth bears do not hibernate. They make their day beds out of broken branches in trees, and rest in caves during the wet season. Sloth bears are the most nocturnal of bears, though sows become more active in daytime when with cubs.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{then returns}} to the treehouse and Bart, Lisa and Maggie, who are not frightened {{by any of the}} stories. <b>They</b> <b>climb</b> down from the treehouse and sleep peacefully the whole night. Homer, on the other hand, lies in his bed terrified. As he notices a raven outside the window similar to the one from the poem, Homer exclaims that he [...] "hates Halloween" [...] and hides under the sheets.|$|E
500|$|The routes {{continue}} east past an {{old school}} which hides the city's [...] water tower. The [...] tower {{was the second}} largest elevated storage tank in the United States when it came online in December 2011. It then crosses a bridge which connects two bluffs, underneath which a single line of the Keokuk Junction Railway passes. The routes descend a hill as they head towards downtown; <b>they</b> <b>climb</b> another until the intersection with Main Street.|$|E
500|$|Yellow-bellied marmots {{spend about}} 80% {{of their lives}} in their burrows, 60% of which is spent hibernation. They often spend mid-day and night in a burrow as well. These burrows are usually {{constructed}} on a slope, such as a hill, mountain, or cliff. The hibernating burrows can be up to [...] deep; however, the burrows constructed for daily use are usually only [...] deep. Their hibernation period varies on elevation, but it is typically from September to May. Occasionally, <b>they</b> <b>climb</b> trees and other flora, though they are usually terrestrial.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>climbed</b> for ten minutes, {{and then}} came to a spot where they had a view through the trees down the valley.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>climbed</b> {{back down}} the ladder slowly, into the warm cellar. Klaus bolted the lid behind them. Tasso waited for them, her face expressionless.|$|R
