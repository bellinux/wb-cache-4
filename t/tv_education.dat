Ironically, a BBC- Man Alive documentary, 'Gale Is Dead', featuring an ex-Beecholme child, Gale Parsons, addressed the same subject in 1970, some 15 years earlier.

50|$|One is Jim Flynn's {{now well}} known work, {{based on data}} {{collected}} {{in the course of}} mass testing of military conscripts with the SPM in many countries over many generations, confirming dramatic intergenerational increases (similar to the equally well-known but commonly overlooked increases in height and longevity) in psychological test scores. While this work reveals a massive impact of the environment on these scores, the causes of this increase are as hard to elucidate as those that have produced the previously mentioned increases in height and life expectancy. For example, {{one of the things that}} the mass of cross-cultural data accumulated with the RPM shows is that the favourite explanations proffered by psychologists and sociologists - improved living conditions, access to <b>TV,</b> <b>education,</b> family size, diet, ethnicity, calligraphy, test-sophistication - individually have relatively little effect.|$|E
40|$|The term film {{education}} {{refers to}} media education: film and <b>TV</b> <b>education</b> and children creativity in these fields. The thesis presents the meaning, value {{and the current}} situation of film education. Emphasis is given to different possibilities for exercising film education in class: teaching methods and approaches, content, learning materials and aids. Professional film education experience is connected with the usage of modern technical resources (cameras, computers, internet, editing programs). Examples of activities found in reference literature are listed, {{as well as some}} personal suggestions. Since the main purpose of the thesis is to make teachers aware of this field, it assumes the form of a reference book. There is actually no adequate reference book on this subject in Slovenia. To make sure film education will become a part of elementary school curriculum, some cross-curricular connections are also made. The practical value of some possibilities, which have been introduced, as well as pupil response, are presented {{on the basis of a}} 22 -hour film workshop for pupils in Grades 4 to 6. Some pupils' videos, drawings and the results of shooting and editing exercises are included. ...|$|E

40|$|Upland {{farmers in}} Vietnam are {{associated}} with the lowest income and face serious issues of natural resources degradation and environmental pollution because of poor agricultural practices. To persuade the upland farmers to adopt sustainable practices, it is vital first to assess their perception of sustainable agriculture. This study aimed to measure banana farmers’ perception towards sustainable agriculture and its determinants in the Vietnam uplands based on a case study in Quang Tri province. Stratified sample technique was used to randomly select 300 respondents from 2 upland districts of Quang Tri. The primary data were gathered by using a structured questionnaire with Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0. 84. The results showed that the majority (84. 7 %) of the farmers had low to mode rate perceptions of sustainable agriculture. Farmers had positive perceptions towards sustainable agriculture in issues related to protection of agricultural resources, negative effects of agrochemicals on human health and the environment, input application, crop rotation, product consumption and roles of farmer groups; whereas, they had moderate perceptions about issues related to production profits, plant residue use and modern technology application. In addition, the study revealed that agricultural programs on <b>TV,</b> <b>education,</b> ethnic group, economic status and credit use were the factors that affected farmers’ sustainable agriculture perceptions...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the ways in}} which the leading Chinese <b>TV</b> <b>Education</b> provider, CETV, negotiates its role within the parameters of government policy, media industry constraints, media mandates, technological innovation, program reform, public ratings, and increasing audience participation. The author argues that mainly as a result of a radically new horizon of audience expectations, a new kind of participatory citizen is gradually emerging in China. In this process, the article submits, TV programming and program reform can be taken as a reliable indicator of change, since they must balance top-down government directives and bottom-up, popular demand that is measurable in direct audience input and public ratings. The author corroborates this claim through a brief analysis of documentary programs that are being designed more and more to maximize public participation, concluding that while we cannot yet speak of a proper public media sphere in China, there is ample evidence of the training of dialogic and polyphonic interaction that will be able to serve as a formal and practical precondition for more extended public debate. Certainly, the trend toward a participatory style in much recent CETV programming, and at many other TV stations, is unlikely to be reversible. What we are seeing is the birth of a new, TV-trained citizen who will aim to extend the privileges of participation toward contributing to a more fully political forum...|$|E
40|$|Health {{personnel}} {{has been}} thought to pay too {{little attention to}} alcohol-related problems. Knowledge, attitudes and beliefs related to alcohol were studied among 225 physicians, 296 nurses, and 279 clerical employees. Knowledge scores were constructed by giving one point for every correct answer. For knowledge on alcoholic beverages and biological facts (11 questions), the mean scores were: physicians 7. 7, nurses 6. 7, and clerical employees 6. 5. For etiologic knowledge (12 items), the means were: physicians 8. 6, nurses 6. 9, and clerical employees 6. 3. The respective scores for prognostic knowledge (9 items) were: physicians 6. 8, nurses 6. 3, clerical employees 5. 5. For knowledge on prevention and treatment the mean scores were: physicians 2. 7, nurses 2. 2 and clerical personnel 2. 3. Physicians had more permissive attitudes towards alcohol use in various social situations and {{were less likely to}} recommend compulsory treatment than nurses or clerical employees. With respect to the prevention of alcohol problems, all groups considered face-to-face health education to be the most effective approach, followed by radio and <b>TV</b> <b>education,</b> and then voluntary treatment. Beverage price increases were regarded to be the least effective approach by nurses and clerical employees, while physicians felt that the press was the least likely source of enlightenment. Knowledge was only remotely related to age, marital status and permissive attitudes. Health personnel knew more about alcohol-related problems than lay people, but there is room for further improvement. alcohol attitudes beliefs knowledge...|$|E

40|$|No Place for Men was a {{collection}} of 33 photographs exhibited from November 9 th – 17 th, 2006 at the British Council in Dacca, Bangladesh, an selected as part of Chobi Mela, the South Asian International Festival of Photography in response to its theme of boundaries. The title {{of the work is}} derived from Rudyard Kipling’s Book Kim, which refers to Spiti, the site location of the images, in the following terms - “Surely the Gods live here, this is no place for men”. Spiti is a ‘culturally Tibetan’ valley in Himachal Pradesh, North India. Since 1993 the researcher has been documenting Spiti in still photographs. This has lead to a book, three catalogues, several magazine spreads and published portfolios. The project investigates the seemingly remote community of Spiti as it engages with and embraces the potentials of the modern world: new technologies, satellite <b>TV,</b> <b>education,</b> tourism and digital communications. This latest exhibition of recent photographs including some in colour, addressed social change and modernity in addition to black and white work describing the more established village life, monastic communities, traditional healers and subsistence farming. The author’s Spiti project evolves in terms of specific subjects, photographic approaches (colour, film-stock, format) and printing. Moreover, for each exhibition the selection of images responds to distinct thematic concerns and the special attributes of the gallery. Variations of the Spiti images have appeared as “Documenting Spiti” at the Slovenian Festival of Photography (Fotopub); and as “Spiti The Forbidden Valley” at Circolo Tina Modotti (Italy), Gallery Profil (Slovakia), the Blue Sky Gallery (USA) and at the European Photography Festival. Catalogues accompanied the Chobi Mela, Profil, and the Blue Sky Gallery shows (2006, 2003 and 2002). Further selections were published in The Sunday Times (six pages), in Il Sopratutto, and Next Level (eight pages and text) ...|$|E

50|$|The teen {{demographic}} targets viewers 11 to 17 {{years of}} age. Live-action series that target this demographic are more dramatic and developed, including teen dramas and teen sitcoms. In some cases, they may contain more mature content {{that is usually}} not permissible on shows targeting younger viewers, and can include some profanity or suggestive dialogue. Animated programming is not generally targeted at this demographic; cartoons that are aimed at teenagers generally feature more crude humor than those oriented toward younger children. Educational programming targeted at this demographic has historically been rare, other than on NASA <b>TV's</b> <b>education</b> block; this has somewhat changed with Litton Entertainment's entry into educational television in the early 2010s, as Litton's programs exploited a loophole in U.S. regulations that allows teen-oriented programs to be counted as educational but {{not be subject to}} restrictions on advertising for children's programs. However, some programming aimed at the demographic has had some tangenital educational value in regards to social issues, such as the now-defunct T-NBC block of sitcoms, which often tackled issues such as underage drinking or drug use.|$|R
