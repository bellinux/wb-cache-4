Similar to {{the configuration of}} a honeycomb, a geocell panel is designed to encompass consecutive confined cells where soils and aggregates are placed. The cellular confinement system of the geocell is beneficial in the reinforcement of track ballast, which helps restrain lateral movement and minimise vertical subsidence of a trackbed. To {{gain an understanding of}} the reinforcement, a numerical study has been conducted. The study uses the discrete element method to simulate the interaction between the geocell and the discrete particles of ballast. Both static and cyclic loading environments are considered.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{potential}} of inkjet printing technology for the fabrication of Near Field Communication (NFC) coil antennas. As inkjet printing technology enables deposition of a different number of layers, an accurate adjustment of the printed conductive <b>tracks</b> <b>thickness</b> is possible. As a consequence, input resistance and Q factor can be finely tuned as long as skin depth is not surpassed while keeping the same inductance levels. This allows the removal of the typical damping resistance present in current NFC inductors. A general methodology including design, simulation, fabrication, and measurement is presented for rectangular, planar-spiral inductors working at 13. 56 [*]MHz. Analytical formulas, computed numerical models, and measured results for antenna input impedance are compared. Reflection coefficient is designated as a figure of merit to analyze the correlation among them, which is found to be below − 10 [*]dB.

Furthermore, {{in order to examine}} the materials behavior at strain rates typical of athletics applications, the rate dependence of the constitutive parameters was investigated. A finite element model, taking into consideration the post-impact nonlinear dynamics of the track surface and of the system (track surface + artificial athlete), was developed and validated through comparison with the results of FR tests.

The thermal induced shear stress in the flex substrate during the lead-free reflow process was studied and the effect of the design changes including the <b>track</b> <b>thickness,</b> flex thickness, and copper width were studied. For both types of flexes, the one of most important variables for minimizing damage to the substrate is the height of the copper tracks. The height of flex and the width of copper track show less impact. Beside of the geometry effects, the increase in reflow peak temperature can also result in {{a significant increase in the}} interfacial stress between the copper track and flex.

The coating, 55 nm MoS 2 on 35 nm of TiN, was deposited by ion-beam assisted deposition onto a steel substrate. Friction coefficient (m) and electrical contact resistance (Rc) measurements were recorded at ~ 2 mm intervals along the track; these spatially resolved measurements were compared to the more commonly presented cycle-averaged values. The last-cycle tracks of several runs were also analyzed {{by a variety of}} microscopies and spectroscopies to identify compositions and determine thicknesses of films on the tracks and balls. Rc measurements, both averaged and spatially resolved, were more sensitive to coating damage and loss than m measurements. In the averaged data, fluctuations in Rc were observed before fluctuations in µ. Spatially resolved data showed that local drops in Rc could be detected as early as 20 % of life. Additionally, recovery of both high µ and low Rc regions, interpreted as healing of damage in the contact, occurs. Friction coefficient data were insensitive to changes in MoS 2 coating thickness; conversely, Rc followed wear <b>track</b> <b>thickness</b> and consequently may provide an in situ method of monitoring coating wear...|$|E
40|$|Loggers for {{continuous}} {{measurement of the}} corrosion rate of metals under atmospheric conditions were developed. The electronic unit measures and records changes in the electrical resistance of a thin metal track applied on an insulating substrate. If the metal corrodes, the effective cross-sectional area of the track decreases and the electrical resistance increases. Part of the metal track is protected by an organic coating and, thus, serves as a reference to compensate for resistivity changes due to varying temperature. Sensors made of silver, copper, iron / steel, zinc, bronze and lead with sensitivities tailored to different environments are available. Thin film metal sensors with the metal <b>track</b> <b>thickness</b> from 50 to 800 nm were made by physical vapour deposition (PVD). Examples of the logger application {{for continuous}} measurements of metal corrosion rates in air are given.

Gases in these concentrations were reported to be found in museums and other cultural heritage institutions and are expected to cause accelerated deterioration of metal objects.

40|$|Cold-formed steel {{structural}} members are used extensively in building construction, {{with a common}} application being wind load bearing steel studs. The studs frame into horizontal steel track members {{at the top and}} bottom of the wall assembly, with the stud-to-track connection typically being made with self-drilling screws or welds. The wall studs are designed to carry lateral loads only and must be checked for web crippling at the end reactions. While a design expression currently exists for the single stud-to-track connection, there is no similar design expression for multiple jamb stud members. An experimental investigation was carried out, consisting of 94 jamb stud assembly tests subjected to end-one-flange loading. The stud-to-track connections consisted of single C-section studs located at the end of a track simulating a door opening, and a built-up jamb made up of two studs simulating framing at either a window or door opening. The members were attached to the track with self-drilling screws. The research objective was to determine the failure modes and develop a design expression for these structural assemblies. The scope of the experimental investigation covered the following range of parameters: i) 	Stud and track depths of 92 mm and 152 mm; ii) 	Stud and <b>track</b> <b>thickness</b> (0. 84 mm, 1. 12 mm, 1. 52 mm and 1. 91 mm); iii) 	Configuration of jamb studs (back-to-back, toe-to-toe and single); iv) 	Location of jamb studs in the track (interior and end); v) 	Screw size (# 8, # 10 and # 12); vi) 	Screw location (both flanges and single flange). Based on the findings of this investigation, design expressions are proposed to predict the capacity of this connection for two limit states: web crippling of the jamb stud; and, punch-through of the track. The web crippling design expression was taken from the North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members [AISI 2007 a; CSA 2007] with new coefficients developed from the test data of the jamb stud-to-track assemblies. A new design expression is also proposed for the track punch-through failure mode, which differs from the approach currently used in the North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing – Wall Stud Design [AISI 2007 b].

40|$|Swedish {{transport}} administration initiated this Master Thesis {{project and}} {{the aim was to}} compare regulations for the design of high-speed railways from three European countries: France, Germany and Spain. The reason why this is of interest for the Swedish transport administration is the design of the first Swedish high-speed railway, called Ostlänken. Therefore, a literature study of the regulations and other literature regarding high-speed railway has been carried out. A basic description of railway components, slab track and ballasted tracks is presented. Ballasted embankments usually consist of a trackbed layer (ballast onto subballast), and the ultimate thickness of this layer is discussed, as {{there are a number of}} methods available to calculate the appropriate thickness, with a number of different design parameters. These design methods results in different <b>trackbed</b> <b>thickness</b> and choosing the “wrong” method might lead to an overestimation or underestimation of the trackbed layer. Constructing a ballastless railway line means that the ballast is replaced by another material, usually a slab made of reinforced concrete or asphalt, and the rail is cast onto this slab. Countries design their slab using different methods. Germany has constructed high-speed railway lines with a slab track solution, generally slabs with low flexible stiffness. France has until recently constructed their high-speed line ballasted but is now developing a new slab track technique, called NBT (New Ballastless Track) and Spain uses various methods. It is difficult to compare the regulations, however, there are some factors that at least begin to explain the differences between the countries: the frost hazard, the inherent ground quality, purpose with the railway (mixed traffic, solely passenger traffic, etc.), design parameters (life, axle load, etc.). Furthermore, the settlement requirements, soil classification and bearing capacity are factors that varies from country to country, but the origin for this variation is harder to detect...|$|R

Accordingly, flux declines are severe at ca. 93 %. Permeate line closed (PLC) operation leads to the complete removal of the deposit layer, and the recovery of 60 % of the flux. However, permeate line open (PLO) operation leads to only a 50 % flux recovery and an asymptotic deposit thickness of 10 m.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The conference {{proceedings}} are available from: [URL] {{of the major}} roles of railway trackbed layers is to reduce vehicle induced stresses applied to the underlying subgrade to a level that limits the progressive build up of permanent deformation. The ability of trackbed layers to satisfy this requirement is dependent upon the materials used for construction and their thickness. Numerous design methods, (both empirical and analytical), have been developed across the World to evaluate <b>trackbed</b> design <b>thickness.</b> However, where there is limited information or experience of previous trackbed design with the specific materials or site conditions under consideration, the choice of methodology becomes one of engineering judgment, in assessing the significance and reliability of the design input parame-ters.

The produced design thicknesses {{for each of the}} methods are compared for differing subgrade conditions. The results show considerable variation of thicknesses from each method with little consistent pattern to the variation. Reasons for these variations are suggested and the choice of the final design used for specific subgrade conditions are presented together with appropriate justification.

On track transition noise is studied as a function of linear density at three different record spacings for each media type. Transition noise is found to increase with linear record density as expected, as well as with record spacing for a given linear density. Track profiles were performed at three linear record densities for each record spacing to observe the density dependence of similar effects on track edge noise.

Moreover, hardness values ranging between 400 - 450 HV and 320 - 380 HV was measured in the deposited <b>tracks</b> with clad <b>thicknesses</b> of 0. 5 and 1 mu m, respectively. This was attributed to the presence of fine austenitic grains of the size 4 - 8 urn. Apart from the minute porosities observed in the dads, micro-cracking on the top surface of the tracks due to residual thermal stresses has also been reported. Lastly, "end-of-track" cracking was noticed in the deposited tracks and the possible mechanisms of crack formation are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
