To this end, a computational mechatronics platform was integrated to run the scheme for the analysis, synthesis and design to achieve planar biped walking. The result is an advanced computational tool that integrates advanced modeling and control as well as path planning techniques along with hardware-in-the-loop for perhaps the simplest biped robot. An experimental underactuated three-degree-of-freedom (two active and one passive) active biped robot yields encouraging results; that is, achieving biped walking with this simple device requires adding a <b>telescopic</b> <b>support</b> <b>leg.</b> Considering a more complete dynamic model {{to take into account}} frictional and contact forces...|$|R

50|$|Just {{prior to}} the swing phase, the athlete should land on the <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> with the knee {{slightly}} flexed so as to absorb some of the impact and thereby stabilize the body for more effective motion of the kicking leg. The best position of the <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> {{has been found to}} be 5 to 10 cm to the side of the ball (left of the ball for a right-footed kicker, right of the ball for a left-footed kicker). Skilled athletes have a tendency toward a closer ball-to-support leg side position. For forward to back positioning, there is variability based on the desired action of the ball. Placing the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> further behind the ball will produce a greater upward direction whereas placing the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> closer to the ball will produce greater forward propulsion. Ball flight trajectory is dictated by the supporting foot’s position. The support foot should be positioned so as to be parallel to the intended direction of the ball. Other important body positioning to be aware of is to bend the upper body slightly forward over the ball.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{function}} of torques exerted by the joints of the lower trunk during maximal velocity sprinting. Eight male track and field athletes volunteered, and sprinted 60 m from a standing start position. The ground reaction force of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> was determined using a force platform (1000 Hz), which was placed at the 50 -m mark from the start position. Simultaneously, 3 D coordinates were recorded with a motion analysis system (250 Hz) using 20 cameras (MX-T 20). The joint torques were calculated using inverse dynamics. The contribution of joint torques to the right and left hip joint forces, and the torso joint force, was calculated by a method that simultaneously solves equations of motion for each segment and equations of constraint conditions for adjacent segments connected by a joint. The main results were as follows: (1) During the terminal support phase (80 - 100 % normalized time), the angular velocity of anterior rotation of the pelvis decreased and participants in whom this angular velocity decrease was diminished ran faster (p< 0. 10). (2) During terminal support, the hip joint adduction torque of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint rotated the pelvis forward. The moment of the right and left hip joint forces rotated the pelvis backward. (3) During terminal support, the hip joint force of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> was generated by its hip joint flexion and adduction torque, the hip joint extension torque of the recovery leg, and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint. In contrast, the hip joint force of the recovery leg was generated by the hip joint flexion and adduction torque of the <b>support</b> <b>leg,</b> and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint. (4) During terminal support, the hip joint flexion torque exerted by the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> rotated the pelvis backward. The hip joint adduction torque of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint rotated the pelvis forward. Previous studies showed that the hip flexion torque drives the leg forward from the hip joint extension position. This present study has clarified that the hip joint adduction torque of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint nullify backward rotation of the pelvis due to the hip joint flexion torque exerted by the <b>support</b> <b>leg...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Recent {{studies on}} the insect water strider showed that the insect heavily relies on surface tension force to stay afloat. Inspired by this insect, water strider robots have been {{developed}} using the same locomotive principles as the insect. This paper focuses on numerically modeling the <b>supporting</b> <b>legs</b> of the insect and the robots. The rigid-leg model {{as well as the}} compliantleg model is developed using numerical approaches, under an assumption made on the water surface breaking condition. The effect of different leg material and geometry are discussed. It is shown through simulations that four 7 cm-long Teflon R ○ coated compliant <b>supporting</b> <b>legs</b> with optimized shapes can lift up to 4. 3 grams (0. 15 g/cm), while an actual prototype carried 3. 7 grams. Another prototype using twelve of these legs successfully lifted 9. 3 grams. Experiments show that the analyses capture the important features of the <b>supporting</b> <b>legs.</b> The design rules proposed in this paper will be useful in understanding the insect statics and also the robotic water strider <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> design. This study will allow a heavier robot to be used for education, entertainment or environment monitoring purposes. I...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{investigate}} the influence of the extension of the <b>support</b> <b>leg's</b> joints during the repositioning phase of an ice dancing push-off on performance. The second objective was to identify the relevant kinematic parameters of this skating movement. Seven international level skaters were filmed in the sagittal plane while performing two starting push-offs. Extending the <b>support</b> <b>leg's</b> lower limb joints completed the first push-off. In the second push-off, subjects kept these joints flexed in a static position. Results pointed out that the extension of the <b>support</b> <b>leg's</b> joints significantly increased the push-off length and velocity by 9 % and 6 % respectively. The temporal structure of the push-off was not altered by the two testing conditions. Regarding the angular parameters of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> during the repositioning phase, the knee joint amplitude, average knee angular velocity and peak thigh velocity were positively related to the push-off velocity. Considering the above results, coaches should now focus on the development of the knee extensors' power during off-ice training sessions. This would enhance the velocity of the skater during the repositioning phase solely from the action of one lower limb...|$|R

However in both rotating directions, the swinging legs exist, {{and one of the}} swinging legs hits the ground and forms a <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> polygon with the <b>supporting</b> <b>legs.</b> Because of the newly formed supporting polygon, the robot will maintain standing posture if the tumbling velocity is low.|$|R

This paper considers ring resonator based rate sensors and investigates the influence of design changes to the ring and <b>support</b> <b>legs</b> on thermoelastic damping, which is the dominant dissipation mechanism. A computational method is used to quantify the thermoelastic damping and a detailed parameter study is conducted to understand the influence of ring geometry, <b>support</b> <b>legs</b> and micro-machined slots around the ring circumference. The results show that damping in the <b>support</b> <b>legs</b> can have significant influence on the total energy dissipated from the resonator, and the optimum leg geometry can be identified to achieve high Q. It is also observed that the addition of slots improves Q for resonators having higher energy loss. However, for high-Q, rings slots have a detrimental effect. The results presented are useful for designing ring resonators with reduced levels of damping...|$|R
50|$|The classic speedskating {{technique}} is an alternating cycle of inside-edge pushes and outer-edge glides. The cycle starts as the skater is gliding on one (let us suppose the right) leg with a bent knee. He then straightens (extends) the right knee and hip while leaning to the left. The {{direction of the}} push is therefore outwards (rightwards) {{from the center of}} mass. When the pushing leg reaches full extension he sets down the left (now <b>support)</b> <b>leg</b> and glides on it while picking up the right leg and bringing it back behind and underneath him (recovery) ready to be placed on the ground (set down) and become the new <b>support</b> <b>leg.</b> Once the pushing leg has been recovered, the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> pushes out in the other direction and the cycle repeats. Note that the pushes are always in a lateral direction: the left leg pushes exclusively leftwards, and the right leg exclusively rightwards.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Walking {{is one of}} {{the basic}} human activities. Several well-defined, motion {{tracking}} systems have been used for gait analysis. However, these systems such as the optical motion tracking system are very expensive and limited to laboratory usage. Recently, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) -based inertial sensors have made it possible to overcome these disadvantages. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify gait events and the <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> by measuring the mediolateral swing angle. An inertial sensor unit with a 3 -axis accelerometer and 2 -axis gyroscope was attached to the subject’s lower trunk using an elastic band. Five, healthy and young (20 – 29 yrs.) subjects participated in this experiment. Each walked twice along a straight, 25 -m path at three different speeds. During each trial, the sensor transmitted signals to a PC via Bluetooth technology. In this study, gait events and the <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> were identified using the peak and sign of the mediolateral swing angle. The mediolateral swing angle was calculated using the integrated gyroscope signal. For comparison, a well-defined spatiotemporal gait analysis technique was also applied. In this reference method, the gait event was identified with the last peak of the vertical acceleration before the sign change from positive to negative. The <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> was identified using the sign of the mediolateral acceleration double integration. Identification of the <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> was difficult in the referenc...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between isokinetic relative torques of hip, knee and ankle joints and the height of guide leg jump in young men. Methods: 27 college male athletes with mean age of 25 ± 3. 5 years, height 178. 5 ± 7. 8 cm and weight of 75. 7 ± 10. 7 kg voluntarily participated in this study. Isokinetic torque of hip, knee and ankle joints and the height of vertical jump were measured using BIODEX SYSTEM PRO 4 and digital vertical jumping tester systems respectively. Pearson correlation test at p< 0. 05 was used for statistical analysis. Results: Results showed that there were significant correlations between height of jump and hip joint flexion (p= 0. 047 & r= 0. 39) and extension (p= 0. 003 & r= 0. 55) torques of guide leg, hip joint extension torque of <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> (p= 0. 020 & r= 0. 45) and knee joint flexion (p= 0. 019 & r= 0. 45) and extension torques of <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> (p= 0. 006 & r= 0. 52).
