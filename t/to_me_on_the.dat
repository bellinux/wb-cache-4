25|$|Count Benedetti spoke <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> promenade, {{in order}} to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally I told him that I had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since {{received a letter from}} the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E

From our brother's account he has given away both his girl and his money. Apparently it is the ordinary confidence trick." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 1972, Vulović {{expressed}} {{willingness to}} resume {{working as a}} flight attendant. The airline apparently felt that her presence on flights would attract too much publicity and instead gave her a desk job negotiating freight contracts. Vulović was celebrated as a national hero and decorated by Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito. The Serbian folk singer Miroslav Ilić recorded a song in her honour, titled Vesna stjuardesa ("Vesna the Stewardess"). She continued to fly regularly and stated that fellow passengers were surprised to see her on flights. [...] "People always want to sit next <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plane," [...] she remarked.|$|E
500|$|Kinsler, who is Jewish, {{and whose}} father is Jewish {{while his mother}} is Catholic, has become a {{prominent}} figure in the Jewish community, and enjoys the attention that he attracts from it. He was featured in the 2008 Hank Greenberg 75th Anniversary edition of Jewish Major Leaguers Baseball Cards, licensed by Major League Baseball, commemorating the Jewish major leaguers from 1871 through 2008. He joined, among others, teammate Scott Feldman, Brad Ausmus, Kevin Youkilis, Ryan Braun, Gabe Kapler, Jason Marquis, Jason Hirsh, John Grabow, Craig Breslow, and Scott Schoeneweis. Kinsler {{was one of three}} Jewish players in the 2008 All Star Game, joining Youkilis and Braun. He says that [...] "Youkilis will always say something <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bases [...] 'Happy Passover,' he'll throw something at me." [...] In July 2013 he passed Shawn Green with his 163rd steal, to become the all-time career steals leader among Jewish major leaguers.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Gosling {{appeared}} as a disturbed young art student in Stay, a psychological thriller film co-starring Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor. In an uncomplimentary review of the film, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that Gosling [...] "like his fans, deserves better." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety felt that the [...] "capable" [...] McGregor and Gosling [...] "deliver nothing new from what they've shown before". The film grossed $8 million worldwide. Gosling was unfazed by the negative reaction: [...] "I had a kid come up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street, 10 years old, and he says, 'Are you that guy from Stay? What the f--- was that movie about?' I think that's great. I'm just as proud if someone says, 'Hey, you made me sick in that movie,' as if they say I made them cry.” Gosling next starred in 2006's Half Nelson as a drug-addicted junior high school teacher who forms a bond with a young student. To prepare for the role, Gosling moved to New York for one month before shooting began. He {{lived in a small}} apartment in Brooklyn and spent time shadowing an eighth grade teacher. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described [...] "a mesmerizing performance ... that shows the kind of deep understanding of character few actors manage." [...] Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle drew comparisons with Marlon Brando and declared that [...] "nobody who cares about great acting will want to miss his performance". Roger Ebert felt the performance [...] "proves he's one of the finest actors working in contemporary movies." [...] He was nominated for an Academy Award. The film grossed $4 million at the worldwide box office. In 2007, he was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2008, Richards played April Johnson in Dustbin Baby, the BBC dramatisation of the Jacqueline Wilson {{novel of}} the same name. She said that April was a {{difficult}} character to play, as [...] "she is a really different person <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> one hand, she does go through normal things that I can relate to, such as fighting with your parents or getting presents you don't like; but on the other, she has had such a hard life." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{almost six}} feet tall, Parr's {{strength}} {{was said to}} be one of her greatest assets. She was particularly noted for the power of her kicking, both in delivering from the left flank and shooting at goal. Team mate Joan Whalley later wrote: [...] "She had a kick like a mule. She was the only person I knew who could lift a dead ball, the old heavy leather ball, from the left wing over <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right and nearly knock me out with the force of the shot..." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I did score a try, but {{not until}} two minutes from the end when we were {{trailing}} 23-12. So {{in the context of}} that particular match it had little relevance, but I would say it was of lasting value to Australian rugby in the years to come. That is because of the way it was scored. Mark Ella cross-kicked a long ball <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left wing. I gathered and touched down wide out. It {{was probably one of the}} early demonstrations of the partnership, the understanding between Mark and myself, which was to beat fruit on many, many occasions for Australia, Randwick and finally for Amatori in Milan." ...|$|E

[...] He continued, [...] "In the article which followed, the exact words that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad spoke <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Wheel were found; that the President had met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and planned a war against Libya in the early part of September 1985." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The motifs I {{was able}} to select from this milieu (the workers' lives) offered me, in a simple and forthright way, what I {{discovered}} to be beautiful.... People from the bourgeois sphere were altogether without appeal or interest. All middle-class life seemed pedantic <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, I felt the proletariat had guts. It was not until much later...when I {{got to know the}} women who would come to my husband for help, and incidentally also to me, that I was powerfully moved by the fate of the proletariat and everything connected with its way of life.... But what I would like to emphasize once more is that compassion and commiseration were at first of very little importance in attracting me to the representation of proletarian life; what mattered was simply that I found it beautiful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Joshua son of Korchah {{taught that}} Moses stayed on Mount Sinai 40 days and 40 nights, reading the Written Law by day, and {{studying}} the Oral Law by night. After those 40 days, on the 17th of Tammuz, Moses took the Tablets of the Law, descended into the camp, broke the Tablets in pieces, {{and killed the}} Israelite sinners. Moses then spent 40 days in the camp, until he had burned the Golden Calf, ground it into powder like the dust of the earth, destroyed the idol worship from among the Israelites, and put every tribe in its place. And on the New Moon ( [...] , Rosh Chodesh) of Elul (the month before Rosh Hashanah), God told Moses in [...] "Come up <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mount," [...] and let them sound the shofar throughout the camp, for, behold, Moses has ascended the mount, {{so that they do}} not go astray again after the worship of idols. God was exalted with that shofar, as [...] says, [...] "God is exalted with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet." [...] Therefore, the Sages instituted that the shofar should be sounded on the New Moon of Elul every year.|$|E
2500|$|On this {{particular}} instance, {{the captain was}} piloting the landing and said, [...] "All right. Give them <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flare. I have given up." [...] This was not their usual routine. Sixty feet from the runway, the captain began to reduce power {{in preparation for the}} flare and said, [...] "Okay" [...] to the first officer. The first officer immediately deployed the spoilers on the flare, instead of just arming them. The aircraft began to sink heavily and the captain, realizing what had happened, pulled back on the control column and applied full thrust to all four engines. The nose lifted, but the aircraft still continued to sink, hitting the runway with enough force that the number four engine and pylon broke off the wing. There was also a tail strike at this time. Realizing what he had done, the first officer began apologizing to the captain. Apparently unaware of the severity of the damage inflicted on the aircraft, the crew managed to lift off for a go-around, but the lost fourth engine had torn off a piece of the lower wing plating and the aircraft was now trailing fuel, which ignited. The first officer requested a second landing attempt on the same runway but was told it was closed due to debris and was directed to another runway.|$|E

2500|$|In July 1997, Weld was {{nominated}} to become United States Ambassador to Mexico by President Bill Clinton. His nomination stalled after Senate Foreign Relations committee Chairman Jesse Helms refused {{to hold a}} hearing on the nomination, effectively blocking it. Helms was also a Republican and their party held the majority in the chamber, but Helms objected to Weld's moderate stance on social issues such as his support for gay rights, abortion rights, and the legalization of medical marijuana. This refusal to hold hearings was also rumored to be at the request of former United States Attorney General and friend of Helms, Edwin Meese. Meese reportedly had a long-standing grudge against Weld stemming from Weld's investigation of Meese during the Iran-Contra affair. Meese denied the speculation, asserting that he wished to keep his distance from Weld. Weld publicly criticized Helms, which the White House discouraged him from doing, but Weld relished the opportunity, saying: [...] "It feels like being in a campaign. I feel newly energized. I love to stir up the pot. I seem to click on more cylinders when the pot is stirred up." [...] Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that Weld's chances of being confirmed weren't [...] "very good, and that he hurt himself by attacking the chairman unfairly and with political rhetoric that was just uncalled for." [...] There was speculation that the White House would let his nomination [...] "die", but he refused, saying that he hoped President Clinton [...] "does not plan to give in to ideological extortion" [...] and that [...] "I wanted to send a message that I wanted to be captain of my ship [...] even if it's going to bottom." [...] Some speculated that attacking the more conservative Helms was a way to position him to pick up votes from fellow moderate Republicans in a potential run for president in 2000, but he rejected this, saying that [...] "I've {{had a lot of people}} come up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street and say, 'Give 'em hell. That's the Bill Weld we know and love.'" ...|$|E
