50|$|In sociology, {{heterogamy}} refers <b>to</b> a <b>marriage</b> {{between two}} individuals that differ {{in a certain}} criterion, and is contrasted with homogamy for a marriage or union between partners that match according to that criterion. For example, ethnic heterogamy refers <b>to</b> <b>marriages</b> involving individuals of different ethnic groups. Age heterogamy refers <b>to</b> <b>marriages</b> involving partners of significantly different ages. Heterogamy and homogamy are also used <b>to</b> describe <b>marriage</b> or union between people of unlike and like sex (or gender) respectively.|$|R

5|$|The Deshasthas are {{historically}} an endogamous and monogamous {{community for}} whom marriages take place by negotiation. The Mangalsutra is {{the symbol of}} marriage for the woman.

5|$|At {{the time}} British law {{relating}} <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> {{was based on}} the legal doctrine of coverture, in which a woman's legal rights and obligations were subsumed by those of her husband upon their matrimony. By law a woman had no separate legal existence, and all her property became her husband's; divorce initiated by a woman was difficult and complicated. In April 1868 Josephine and fellow suffragist Elizabeth Wolstenholme set up and became joint secretaries of the Married Women's Property Committee to pressure parliament into changing the law. Josephine remained on the committee until the campaign was successful, with the passing into law of the Married Women's Property Act 1882.|$|E
5|$|In the church's teaching, sexual {{activity}} is reserved to married couples, whether in a sacramental marriage among Christians, or {{in a natural}} marriage where one or both spouses are unbaptised. Even in romantic relationships, particularly engagement <b>to</b> <b>marriage,</b> partners are called to practise continence, {{in order to test}} mutual respect and fidelity. Chastity in marriage requires in particular conjugal fidelity and protecting the fecundity of marriage. The couple must foster trust and honesty as well as spiritual and physical intimacy. Sexual activity must always be open to the possibility of life; the church calls this the procreative significance. It must likewise always bring a couple together in love; the church calls this the unitive significance.|$|E
50|$|The Marriage Act is not {{the only}} law under which a {{marriage}} may be contracted.

5|$|Potter {{had become}} tired of writing for {{children}} and increasingly unfamiliar with them. The Moore children (for whom she had written several tales early in her career) were grown, and Potter had not replaced them with other children, although she continued to write letters to child fans who had written her. She was {{out of touch with}} the interests of American children. Her marriage to William Heelis on October 15, 1913 effectively ended her literary and artistic career. Although she published sporadically in the years following her marriage, her works depended principally upon decades-old concepts filed away in her publisher's offices and ageing illustrations tucked away in her portfolio. Only The Tale of Johnny Town-Mouse (1918) brought forth a completely new set of illustrations from the artist. She devoted herself <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> and farming, and avoided publicity and fans.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{the text}} {{can give a}} basic outline that {{correlates}} to the four-movement scheme of a symphony. For instance, the four-part structure of Edgar Allan Poe's The Bells, a progression from youth <b>to</b> <b>marriage,</b> maturity, and death, naturally suggested the four movements of a symphony to Sergei Rachmaninoff, which he followed in his choral symphony of the same name. The text can encourage a composer to expand a choral symphony past the normal bounds of the symphonic genre, as with Berlioz for his Roméo et Juliette, yet stay within the basic structural or aesthetic intent of symphonic form. It can also influence the musical content in parts {{where there is no}} singing, as in Roméo et Juliette. There, Berlioz allows the orchestra to express the majority of the drama in instrumental music and saves words for expository and narrative sections of the work.|$|E

5|$|The {{allure of}} class respectability is another {{constant}} in Les Chouans, {{as it is}} for Balzac's entire oeuvre. Marie's birth as an illegitimate child contributes to her position {{at the start of the}} novel. The ups and downs of her young adult life land her in Corentin's hands, yearning for the 300,000-franc reward promised to her on the capture of Montauran. Marie's focus changes from money <b>to</b> <b>marriage,</b> a sign of hope amid the tragedy of circumstances. When she first considers Montauran, she recognizes that a return of the king would bring privileges; still, her oscillating actions follow the path of her passions, not rational self-interest.|$|E
5|$|The {{preference}} for sons over daughters in India {{is rooted in}} social, economic and religious reasons. Women are often believed to be of a lower value in society due to their non-breadwinner status. Financial support, old age security, property inheritance, dowry and beliefs surrounding religious duties all contribute to the preference of sons over daughters. One {{of the main reasons}} behind the preference of sons is the potential burden of having to find grooms for daughters. Families of women in India often have to pay a dowry and all expenses related <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> in order to marry off a daughter, which increases the cost associated with having a daughter.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from London, the Demerara Court of Policy eventually passed an 'Ordinance for the religious instruction of slaves and for meliorating their condition' in 1825 which institutionalised working hours and some civil rights for slaves. The weekend {{was to be}} from sunset on Saturday to sunrise on Monday; field work was also defined to be from 6 am to 6 pm, with a mandatory two-hour break. A Protector of Slaves was appointed; whipping was abolished for women as was its use in the field. The rights <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> and own property was legalised, as was the right to acquire manumission. Amendments and new ordinances continued to flow from London, each progressively establishing more civil rights for the slaves, but they were strongly resisted by the colonial legislature.|$|E

5|$|While in London, Burnet became {{engaged to}} fellow Australian Edith Linda Marston Druce.

Druce sought out Burnet while on a holiday in London and they quickly agreed <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> although she {{had to return to}} Australia. They married in 1928 after he had completed his Ph.D. and returned to Australia, and had a son and two daughters. At the time, there was a vacancy for the Chair of Bacteriology at the University of London, and Ledingham was lobbying his colleagues to offer Burnet the post, but Burnet returned to Australia, partly because of Druce.|$|E
5|$|Yajnavalkya {{answers that}} one may {{complete}} Brahmacharya (the student stage of life), then Grihastha (householder), followed by Vanaprastha (retirement) and finally Sannyasa (pilgrimage as Parivrajaka Bhikshu, renunciation). Or, continues Yajnavalkya, one may renounce immediately {{after completing the}} student stage of life, or after the householder stage, {{regardless of whether or}} not one has completed the sacred fire ritual or any other rituals. Olivelle interprets the sacred fire ritual reference as an indirect reference <b>to</b> <b>marriage,</b> and thus the text asserts that those who have married or never married can both renounce. The Jabala Upanishad herein recommends that a person may renounce on the day he feels detached from the world, regardless of which stage of life he is in, and whether he has completed that stage.|$|E
5|$|In late 1942, {{recruiting}} requirements {{were such}} that both enlisted and officer candidates {{had to be}} American citizens; have no children under 18 years of age; present three character references; pass a physical examination; and submit a record of occupation after leaving school. Enlisted applicants were also required to have completed {{at least two years}} of high school and be between the ages of 20 and 36 years. Officer candidates were expected to be college graduates, or to have completed two years of college, and have at least two years of acceptable business or professional experience, and be between the ages of 20 and 50 years. Certain regulations with respect <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> applied to both enlisted and officer candidates. Married women could enlist provided their husbands were not in the USCG.
