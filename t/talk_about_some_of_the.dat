50|$|Sykes {{opens her}} {{stand-up}} routine by discussing the United States’ “first Black President,” Barack Obama.

Sykes goes on to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> issues facing the President such as reforming health-care, national resistance to change, revamping education, immigration and racial injustice.
