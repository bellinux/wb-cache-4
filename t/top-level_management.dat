30|$|However, {{the finding}} of no {{relationship}} between market commitment and international market involvement was inconsistent with previous studies (e.g., Hadjikhani 1997). Perhaps the commitment of <b>top-level</b> apparel retail <b>management</b> to {{the time and effort}} necessary for international activities is not transferred to firms’ actual behavior. One reason might lie in the size of firms in the study. For small retailers, the high investment demand may lessen their actual international market involvement regardless of their interests in international expansion. In summary, the results of H 3 and H 4 partially support the Uppsala model, which proposes the importance of market knowledge and market commitment to international market involvement decisions.|$|R

50|$|And furthermore:The {{business}} architecture forms a significantly better basis for subsequent architectures than the separate statements themselves. The {{business architecture}} gives direction to organizational aspects, {{such as the}} organizational structuring (in which {{the responsibilities of the}} business domains are assigned to individuals/business units in the organization chart or where a new organization chart is drawn) and the administrative organization (describing for instance the financial reconciliation mechanisms between business domains). Assigning the various business domains to their owners (managers) also helps the further development of other architectures, because now the managers of these domains can be involved with a specific assigned responsibility.

40|$|Summary. A {{comparison}} of socio-occupational structures of married, single, widowed and divorced women, between 21 and 50 years of age, {{living in the}} Ile-de-France region is developed.

They work more often in liberal professions and <b>top-level</b> and middle-level <b>management.</b> Moreover, the rate of celibacy among working women according to socio-occupational categories moves in an opposite direction from that of working men: the rate is higher in the higher occupational groups.

Many reports of vulnerabilities, organized intrusions, and theft related to department systems and networks have underscored weaknesses in DOD systems. In January 1998, DOD responded to these risks by announcing its plans for a Defense-wide Information Assurance Program to promote integrated, comprehensive, and consistent information assurance (IA) practices across the department. Although the program has addressed issues related to DOD's departmental IA goals, established new IA policy, improved communication across the department, and introduced mechanisms for monitoring IA efforts throughout DOD, many IA issues remain unaddressed. Given the high priority that DOD puts on IA, GAO believes the the program should have made progress on more of its implementation plan objectives by this time and gone further with the ones it has begun to address. <b>Top-level</b> DOD <b>management</b> has not carried out oversight commensurate with the program's high-priority role and the program has not received the resources that were judged necessary by DOD when the program was initiated.
