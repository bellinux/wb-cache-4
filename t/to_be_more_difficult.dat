5|$|While {{three of}} the four {{directions}} were readily identified, West proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult.</b> First, an association was made with the moon goddess Hina, and a Hawaiian story in which her leg was broken. From there, Dietrich postulated that the “broken leg” glyph must in fact be the “pillar of the sunset”.|$|E

5|$|On September 10, 2013, a Deep Impact mission {{status report}} {{explained}} that mission controllers believe the computers on the spacecraft are continuously rebooting themselves {{and so are}} unable to issue any commands to the vehicle's thrusters. As {{a result of this}} problem, communication with the spacecraft was explained <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult,</b> as the orientation of the vehicle's antennas is unknown. Additionally, the solar panels on the vehicle may no longer be positioned correctly for generating power.|$|E
5|$|Reitman needed fifty days to film Up in the Air, {{eight of}} which were devoted to aerial shooting. The aerial shots turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> than expected. He was unable to use three days of the aerial filming. Many aerial shots, such as the crop circle on fire, are seen in the Paramount trailer, but are not used in the film. The pilot who flies the Boeing 747 that carried the space shuttle flew the {{aircraft}} for the aerial shots.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium is {{calculated}} to have several properties {{that differ from}} its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, it may even give up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones. Copernicium has also been calculated to possibly show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all, although more recent calculations cast doubt on this possibility. It has also been predicted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than the other group 12 elements.|$|E

5|$|Digging {{the tunnel}} turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> than expected. The soil was rocky, which forced {{the men to}} dig deeper than planned. There, they {{discovered}} a leaking gas main, which required the installation of special pumps to bring fresh air to the men. To hide the noise from the digging, one of the crew played piano and sang in the house while the others worked below. On July5, Berkman visited the prison stable, planning to make his escape. He was horrified {{to discover that the}} entrance was blocked by a large load of stones and bricks recently dumped for a construction project.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{had begun}} {{as early as}} 1911 to procure arms and smuggle them into India. When {{a clear idea of}} the {{conspiracy}} emerged, more earnest and elaborate plans were made to obtain arms and to enlist international support. Herambalal Gupta, who had arrived in the United States in 1914 at the Berlin Committee's directives, took over the leadership of American wing of the conspiracy after the failure of the SS Korea mission. Gupta immediately began efforts to obtain men and arms. While men were in plentiful supply with more and more Indians coming forward to join the Ghadarite cause, obtaining arms for the uprising proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult.</b>|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult,</b> because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one sense they are simpler: {{the use of a}} separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E

5|$|In the Multiple Classification Card Sorting Task, {{children}} are shown cards {{and asked to}} sort them based on two different dimensions (e.g. by color, such as yellow and blue, and object type, such as animals and food) simultaneously into four piles within a matrix (e.g. yellow animals, yellow foods, blue animals and blue foods). This task appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> as {{research has shown that}} seven-year-old children were incapable of sorting cards based on the two dimensions simultaneously. These children focused on the two dimensions separately, whereas at the age of eleven, children were capable of sorting cards based on these two dimensions simultaneously. This demonstrates an increase in cognitive flexibility between the ages of seven and eleven.|$|E
5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any {{treatment}} prior to planting, and take 26 to 40 days to germinate. Seeds that grow into yellow-flowered plants are pale and unpigmented, while future bronze- and red-flowered plants are dark greyish and black respectively. It generally takes about {{five to seven years}} to flower from seed. The plant favours sandy well-drained soils and a sunny position and can be heavily pruned if necessary, as new growth can arise from the lignotuber. Although it is readily propagated by seed, experiments with in vitro propagation found Banksia menziesii <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> than other species trialled.|$|E
5|$|With Taurasi {{joining the}} core of the 2000 Championship team, Auriemma {{confidently}} predicted another championship in 2001, but the season turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> than expected. UConn won the Big East Tournament over Notre Dame in a game remembered for the Bird at the Buzzer shot, but lost key players Abrosimova and Ralph to season-ending injuries. As a consequence, Taurasi had to play a much larger role than anticipated in the NCAA Tournament. She led UConn to the Final Four, but in the national semifinals against Notre Dame in St. Louis, Taurasi had a poor shooting game, and despite UConn having attained a 16-point lead at one point, the team lost. Notre Dame went on to win its first National Championship.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{creation}} of such a language often includes shared idiosyncrasies from the source languages, active use seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> generally <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> learn than for schematic planned languages, though because of grammatical simplification considerably easier than for ethnic languages of the same type.|$|R
5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) finds {{managing}} her household {{without her}} husband Jim (John Krasinski) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> than anticipated, as she struggles with duties such as {{taking out the}} trash. Her already frazzled condition worsens when she finds lice on her daughter CeCe, leaving her {{no choice but to}} wash all the clothing in the house. At work the next day, she notices Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) frantically scratching her head, and realizes she may have transferred the lice from CeCe to the office. She initiates an investigation and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), who experienced lice infestations as a child in foster care, finds that all of the employees except Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate), Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) have lice. Given her disregard for cleanliness, the employees assume Meredith is responsible; Pam defends her but neglects to admit her guilt. To eliminate the lice, Meredith shaves her head. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) also overreacts, donning a hazmat suit and accidentally exposing himself to a hallucinogenic bug bomb that causes him to faint. On Erin's advice, the other infected employees pair up to put mayonnaise on each other's hair to suffocate the lice, which allows Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) and Erin to spend time together and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) to prank Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) in retaliation for his affair with her husband. Pam's mother calls to inform her that CeCe still has lice; the other staff overhear and realize Pam is responsible for the lice infestation, much to Meredith's delight.|$|E

25|$|Wild silks {{also tend}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to dye than silk from the {{cultivated}} silkworm. A technique known as demineralizing allows the mineral layer around the cocoon of wild silk moths to be removed, leaving only variability in color {{as a barrier}} to creating a commercial silk industry based on wild silks in the parts of the world where wild silk moths thrive, such as in Africa and South America.|$|E
25|$|Serial {{manufacturing}} of the WS-10 {{and integration}} with the J-11, proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> than expected. As a result, even though several related prototypes had been tested {{and at least}} one regiment converted to the Taihang powered J-11B version in 2007, these aircraft were later grounded for an extended period due to a poor operational reliability. A report in the Washington Times suggested that the Chinese engines lasted 30 hours before they needed servicing, compared to 400 hours for the Russian versions. Defects were traced back to the engine manufacturer, Shenyang Liming Aircraft Engine Company employing sub-standard manufacturing and quality control procedures. Several subsequent batches temporarily reverted to the original, Russian AL-31F turbofans. The engines manufacturing problems had finally been solved by the end of 2009 and the WS-10A had reportedly proved mature enough to power the Block 02 aircraft.|$|E
