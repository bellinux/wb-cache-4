5|$|Bardou-Jacquet {{wanted to}} compose the {{advertisement}} {{with as little}} computer-generated imagery as possible, believing that the final product would be that much more appealing to its audience. To this end, he set two months aside {{for the creation of}} hundreds of conceptual drawings detailing various possible interactions between the parts, and a further four months for practical testing and development. For <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> phase, the script was broken into small segments, each comprising only one or two interactions. Ideas deemed unworkable by <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> crew, such as airbag explosions and collisions between front and rear sections of the car, were abandoned, and the remaining segments were slowly brought together until the full and final sequence was developed.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a dual-seat {{version for}} {{training}} and strike roles was proposed and due to the customer interests the development started in 2015. According to the PAF, the JF-17B dual seat fighter jet is currently entering <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> phase.|$|E
5|$|In a test {{of worker}} policing, {{researchers}} examined the removal of worker-laid eggs in Vespula rufa, a wasp that has low paternity. Under <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> conditions, worker policing was not as efficient, {{and some of the}} drones appeared to be from worker-laid eggs.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>test</b> {{execution}} engine {{does not}} carry {{any information about}} <b>the</b> <b>tested</b> product. Only <b>the</b> <b>test</b> specification and <b>the</b> <b>test</b> data carries information about <b>the</b> <b>tested</b> product.|$|R
50|$|To test if a {{distribution}} is other than unimodal, several additional tests have been devised: <b>the</b> bandwidth <b>test,</b> <b>the</b> dip <b>test,</b> <b>the</b> excess mass <b>test,</b> <b>the</b> MAP <b>test,</b> <b>the</b> mode existence <b>test,</b> <b>the</b> runt <b>test,</b> <b>the</b> span <b>test,</b> and <b>the</b> saddle <b>test.</b>|$|R

5|$|Periodically, {{the release}} team publishes {{guidelines}} to the developers {{in order to}} ready the release. A new release occurs after a freeze, when all important software is reasonably up-to-date in <b>the</b> <b>Testing</b> branch and any other significant issues are solved. At that time, all packages in <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> branch become the new stable branch. Although freeze dates are time-based, release dates are not, which are announced by the release managers {{a couple of weeks}} beforehand.|$|E
5|$|The recruits' {{indoctrination}} {{period at}} Palm Beach was six weeks. It covered instruction on subjects such as: activities, organization, personnel, current events, and social hygiene. The physical education aspects consisted of: body mechanics, swimming, games, and drill. Another {{important part of}} recruit training was <b>the</b> <b>testing,</b> classification, and selection process. This was designed {{to make the most}} of the recruit's abilities, background and interests. The results of <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> were usually the basis for general assignments or the opportunity for specialized training.|$|E
5|$|After initial aliveness {{testing that}} showed no issues, STIS {{was taken into}} {{functional}} testing, and issues were seen when the telescope put itself into safe mode due to a low thermal limit sensor. Ground controllers at Goddard would restart <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> once the thermal limit sensor was back in normal sensor range, but it is believed the component is in good shape.|$|E

5|$|Although the VB-13 {{project had}} not reached <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> stage {{by the end}} of World War II, it avoided being cancelled, {{proceeding}} as a low-priority project. Limited testing was conducted during 1948 and 1949; additional testing at Alamogordo, New Mexico in 1950 led to the Tarzon being approved for operational service in the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Tu-142's {{military}} applications, a one-off Tu-142MP {{was used}} to test a new ASW suite. Another Tu-142 was converted to replace the Tu-95LL for <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> of turbojet engines. Designated Tu-142LL, the ASW equipment and armament were removed to allow an engine test bed to be carried under the belly. Some of the engines installed were the NK-25 for the Tu-22MZ, RD36-51A for the Tu-144D, and the NK-32 for the Tu-160. The first Tu-142MK was converted for an airborne laboratory role, setting several altitude-in-horizontal and time-to-altitude records in its class.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of 1960, {{the first section of}} freeway along M-78 was opened in the Lennon area. The next year, the freeway had been {{extended}} as far southwest as Durand from the end at Lennon. Also in 1961, the MSHD had proposed that the section of US27 south of Lansing be built as an electronic highway under a bid through General Motors; <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> for such a roadway was ultimately done at Ohio State University instead.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>test</b> {{method for}} {{conducting}} <b>the</b> <b>test</b> usually involves a specified test fixture on a universal testing machine.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>test</b> {{was nearly}} universally {{condemned}} {{by the international}} community. Following <b>the</b> <b>test,</b> <b>the</b> United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1874 condemning <b>the</b> <b>test</b> and tightening sanctions on the country.|$|R
30|$|The {{friction}} in <b>the</b> <b>test</b> lanes {{in section}} B increased {{at the start}} of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> but then fell continuously until the end of <b>the</b> <b>test.</b> This is consistent with the results for <b>the</b> <b>test</b> lanes in section A. However, the friction in the reference lane in section B was quite constant throughout <b>the</b> <b>test,</b> whereas that in the reference lane in section A decreased somewhat.|$|R
5|$|During the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{executed}} {{a number of}} nuclear tests {{on the island of}} Amchitka in the face of vehement opposition from environmental and local indigenous groups. The first test, conducted in 1965, caused significant damage to the surrounding area, although the details of this damage were not released to the public until 1969. In 1969, the AEC executed a 'calibration shot' to determine whether Amchitka would be suitable for future tests. In 1970, the AEC announced plans to detonate a bomb named 'Cannikin', set to release a blast 385 times that released by the dropping of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945. After a United States Supreme Court challenge to <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> failed by one vote, <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> proceeded as scheduled in November 1971.|$|E
5|$|During the manufacturer's flight tests, the Yak-19 {{became the}} first Soviet {{aircraft}} to exceed 900km/h. Major Sergei Anokhin was the primary test pilot and reported that the aircraft had pleasant and predictable flying characteristics and presented no difficulties for the average pilot. Before <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> was completed, Anokhin led the jets participating in the flypast at Tushino Airfield on 3 August.|$|E
5|$|For adults, <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> of electrolyte, {{blood glucose}} and calcium levels is {{important}} to rule out problems with these as causes. An electrocardiogram can rule out problems with {{the rhythm of the}} heart. A lumbar puncture may be useful to diagnose a central nervous system infection but is not routinely needed. In children additional tests may be required such as urine biochemistry and blood testing looking for metabolic disorders.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>test</b> last {{block is}} simply reversed, the process blocks are {{completed}} before <b>the</b> <b>test</b> is performed. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> last loop {{allows for the}} process blocks to be performed at least once before <b>the</b> first <b>test.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> two-step <b>test</b> sample {{representation}} {{method is}} proposed for face recognition. It first identifies k “representative” samples from each category training samples for <b>the</b> <b>test</b> sample then produces a weighted {{sum of all}} the “representative” samples that well approximates <b>the</b> <b>test</b> sample. This method assigns <b>the</b> <b>test</b> sample to <b>the</b> class whose training samples have the smallest deviation from <b>the</b> <b>test</b> sample. As <b>the</b> method proposed in this paper is able to reduce the side-effect of the other training samples that are very “far” from <b>the</b> <b>test</b> sample on <b>the</b> recognition decision of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> sample, <b>the</b> high recognition rates can be obtained...|$|R
40|$|During {{aerodynamic}} {{testing of}} a turbo engine model, <b>the</b> <b>test</b> structure crashed. One {{reason for the}} disaster may have been structural dynamic vibrations of the CRUF bellmouth.

5|$|In 2012, Air Combat Command {{requested}} <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> of a 600-gallon external {{fuel tank}} which would extend the A-10's loitering time by 45–60 minutes; flight testing {{of such a}} tank had been conducted in 1997, but did not involve combat evaluation. Over 30 flight tests were conducted by the 40th Flight Test Squadron to gather data on the aircraft's handling characteristics and performance across different load configurations. It was reported that the tank slightly reduced stability in the yaw axis, {{but there was no}} decrease in aircraft tracking performance.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, the Benadir {{administration}} {{completed the}} SECIL project {{in conjunction with}} the EU and UNHABITAT. The 3.5 million EUR initiative lasted three and a half years, and saw the establishment in Mogadishu of a new sustainable waste collection system, a Technical Training Centre, water quality testing laboratories, ameliorated access to clean drinking water, improved employment and livelihood opportunities in the low-cost fuel production sector, strengthened skills training and regulation in the construction sector, and laboratories for <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> of construction material quality.|$|E
