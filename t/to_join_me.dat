2500|$|Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez (Democrat, California), [...] "appalled" [...] by the {{situation}} {{created by the}} book and the four Republican endorsements, said [...] "I urge the rest of my colleagues <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>me</b> in denouncing this witch hunt, which is clearly intended to create fear and distrust in our Capitol Hill community."

2500|$|Sun Ce told Taishi Ci, [...] "In the past, when Liu Yao criticised me {{for helping}} Yuan Shu conquer Lujiang, he didn't have good {{intentions}} and his reasons were not convincing. Why? Yuan Shu had {{control over the}} thousands of troops {{which used to be}} under my father's command. I wanted to make great achievements, so I {{had no choice but to}} submit to Yuan Shu and ask him to give me control of my father's troops. Even then, he only gave me back about 1,000 men. When he ordered me to attack Lujiang, the circumstances I was in were so desperate that I had no choice but to obey him. Later on, he turned evil and wanted to commit treacherous acts. I tried to dissuade him but he wouldn't listen. That was when I decided to sever ties with him. My relationship with Yuan Shu is only up to this extent. Now that Liu Yao is dead, there is no chance for me to explain to him anymore. However, his son still lives in Yuzhang. I don't know how Hua Ziyu treats him, and whether Liu Yao's former followers have decided to serve Hua Ziyu. You are from the same commandery as Liu Yao, and you served under him before. I hope you can visit his son and convey my wishes to his followers. If they wish <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>me,</b> I will welcome them; if they don't, do treat them kindly. At the same time, you can assess how strong Hua Ziyu's defences are, and see if the peoples of Luling and Poyang are willing <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>me.</b> You can bring along as many men as you wish." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I have committed unpardonable acts. Yet, you treat me as generously as how Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin treated former enemies who surrendered to them. The ancients lived by a code of loyalty until death. I don't need too many men to accompany me. Just a dozen or so will be sufficient." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2003, Wallace {{wrote the}} book <b>Join</b> <b>Me</b> about how he started the movement. A quote {{on the cover of}} some editions is [...] "It's not a cult; it's a collective" [...] - because Wallace didn't want <b>to</b> {{associate}} <b>Join</b> <b>Me</b> with the negative connotations of the word cult. Nevertheless, as his book's sub-title is, [...] "The true story of a man who started a cult by accident," [...] it would seem he has grudgingly admitted that it has similarities to one.|$|R
