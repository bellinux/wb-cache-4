Hartranft wrote a memorandum to President Johnson outlining Powell's statement, adding that he believed Powell <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> the truth. Powell then made a statement exonerating Atzerodt, declaring that Atzerodt refused to kill Vice President Johnson even though Booth had ordered him to do so.|$|E
500|$|Co-creators and {{executive}} producers Damon Lindelof and J.J. Abrams wrote the premiere's teleplay {{based upon a}} story by Lindelof. The episode was Abrams' first Lost writing credit since the pilot. They laid out the third season {{with the idea of}} [...] "us versus them"; Carlton Cuse, a showrunner, explained, [...] "And who is us? And who is them? I mean I think we all tend to objectify people who we don't know much about and I think that's the audience's view of The Others right now -- they are bad, they are the malevolent force on the island. But {{over the course of the}} stories we're going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> this season on the show we expect the audience's view of The Others to change a lot." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{potential}} crossovers with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Bell said in March 2016, {{in reference}} to the way Hunter and Morse were written off of that series, [...] "We want to be clear we're telling a different type of story, and in doing so, you don't want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> a story where you go, [...] "Why don't they call Coulson? He can fix this easily," [...] because that line's been cut. Not that you can't bring them back someday or have someone from S.H.I.E.L.D. show up on this show, but it's really setting up a different [...] universe". Blood described the situation as [...] "they're on their own, they can make up their own rules, just turn the phones on airplane mode and ignore the calls from back home".|$|E
500|$|Most reviewers were {{impressed}} with {{the premise of the}} novel, but critical of its melodramatic style. While Griffin praised the plot and concept as [...] "clever", she argued that Niffenegger's writing is usually [...] "pedestrian" [...] and the story at times contrived. Heidi Darroch of the National Post agreed, contending that the story has an excess of overwrought emotional moments [...] "which never quite add up to a fully developed plot". Writing in The Chicago Tribune, Carey Harrison praised the originality of the novel, specifically the intersection of child-bearing and time travel. Despite appreciating the novel's premise, Amidon complained that the implications of Henry's time-traveling were poorly thought out. For example, Henry has foreknowledge of the September 11 attacks but does nothing to try to prevent them. Instead, on 11 September 2001, he gets up early [...] "to listen to the world being normal for a little while longer". Amidon also criticized the novel's [...] "overall clumsiness", writing that Niffenegger is [...] "a ham-fisted stylist, long-winded and given to sudden eruptions of cliche". Miriam Shaviv agreed to an extent, writing in The Jerusalem Post, [...] "There are no original or even non-cliched messages here. True love, Niffenegger seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> us, is timeless, and can survive even the worst [...] yet, the book is a page-turner, delicately crafted and psychologically sound." [...] The Library Journal described the novel as [...] "skillfully written with a blend of distinct characters and heartfelt emotions"; it recommended that public libraries purchase multiple copies of the book.|$|E
2500|$|Addressing {{the depth}} of his character's romance with Luke and its effects on people, Silbermann cited his disbelief. [...] "I knew what the role was when I signed on," [...] he said. [...] "But I guess I'm jaded [...] I {{honestly}} didn't think it would get so much press. Of course, I'm grateful and honored <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> this story and doing it in an interesting and respectful way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Turning his {{attention}} to the condoned Russification of the 1950s, he exclaimed: [...] "Comrades, there is not one invention, not one thing new in this world, without there also being a Russian coming right up, for them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> us that this Russian has in fact 'uncovered' that new fact, that new invention, beforehand!!" [...] Claiming to cite a SovRom engineer, Drăghici compared the Soviet treatment of Romanians with the apartheid regime. Although Romania still condemned [...] "Titoism", the speaker paid tribute to neighboring Yugoslavia's Eastern Bloc dissidence.|$|E

She {{picks up her}} harp and sings a beautiful, but vaguely {{sinister}} aria; some sixth sense seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> her that things are bound to turn out badly: Non so le tetre immagini / [...] "Dark forebodings I cannot banish from my thoughts". When Corrado finally arrives, the two sing a duet that captures both the serenity of their love and the uncertainty of their future. Medora pleads with Corrado not to leave, but finally he departs to confront the Pasha.|$|E
2500|$|Schwartz {{said that}} he wrote the highly {{regarded}} Pilot episode in his boxer shorts. [...] "I {{had no idea what}} would come of it and there was just that purity to it." [...] The script for the Pilot attracted most of the regular cast to the project, including film star Peter Gallagher, who said of the Pilot, [...] "In that recently post-9/11 America, I read this script and thought it was astounding. I thought it was exactly the right story <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> at that point in time. It was about a family living in a not very embracing community, one that doesn't necessarily share all their values. [...] they don't lose their sense of humor or their inclination to help. They still open their arms and embrace this outsider kid. And I thought that was powerful in an era with a kind of xenophobia, a kind of looking-over-your-shoulder and getting small and angry, sort of creeping into the PATRIOT Act-fueled environment. This espoused a kind of America... It just felt right. And it had a sense of humor." ...|$|E

2500|$|Otello laments {{his fate}} (Dio! mi potevi scagliar tutti i mali / [...] "God, {{you could have}} thrown every evil at me" [...] ). When Iago calls out [...] "Cassio is here!" [...] Otello hides as Iago and Cassio enter. Cassio says {{he had hoped to}} see Desdemona here, for he wanted to know whether she had been {{successful}} with Otello (Iago, Cassio, Otello: Vieni; l'aula è deserta / [...] "Come, the hall is deserted"). Iago asks him to tell of his adventures with that woman. Cassio asks which woman, and, softly, so that Otello cannot hear, Iago says [...] "Bianca" [...] (the name of Cassio's actual lover). As Cassio laughs about his romantic adventures, Otello assumes he is speaking of Desdemona. In a conversation only partially heard, Cassio seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> Iago that another woman, a secret admirer, left him a handkerchief as a token. At Iago's urging, Cassio produces it, whereupon Iago seizes it—for it is Desdemona's—and holds it out where he knows Otello can see it. He then returns it to Cassio and teases him, while in his hiding place Otello fumes (Iago, Cassio, Otello: Questa è una ragna dove il tuo cuor casca / [...] "This is a spiderweb in which your heart is caught").|$|E
