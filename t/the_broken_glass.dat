25|$|If a {{fluorescent}} lamp is broken, {{a very small}} amount of mercury can contaminate the surrounding environment. About 99% of the mercury is typically contained in the phosphor, especially on lamps that are {{near the end of}} their life. <b>The</b> <b>broken</b> <b>glass</b> is usually considered a greater hazard than the small amount of spilled mercury. The EPA recommends airing out the location of {{a fluorescent}} tube break and using wet paper towels to help pick up <b>the</b> <b>broken</b> <b>glass</b> and fine particles. Any glass and used towels should be disposed of in a sealed plastic bag. Vacuum cleaners can cause the particles to become airborne, and should not be used.|$|E

Observing her death mask through a glass panel, Kruvajan breaks the panel (and the cross above it) by accident while striking a bat. He then removes Asa's death mask revealing a partially preserved corpse that is visible underneath, her face staring out malevolently. He cuts his hand on <b>the</b> <b>broken</b> <b>glass.</b> Some of his blood drips onto Asa's dead face.|$|E

2500|$|Inflammable Gass – Damon {{suggests}} {{he may be}} based on the scientist and philosopher Joseph Priestley, as Gass' reference to [...] "flogiston" [...] recalls Priestley's experiments with phlogiston, which were quite well known at the time. G.E. Bentley reaches a similar conclusion, citing a demonstration given at the Free Masons Tavern on Great Queen Street during which some phosphorus ignited and destroyed the lamp containing it. Bentley believes that this incident may have formed the basis for <b>the</b> <b>broken</b> <b>glass</b> during an experiment in chapter 10. Erdman however, rejects this identification, arguing that there is no evidence Blake was familiar with either the demonstrations or the writings of Priestley. Instead, Erdman suggests that Gass may simply be a characteristic type representing all science in general. In 1951, Palmer Brown suggested that Gass may {{be based on the}} conjurer Gustavus Katterfelto, who was as famous as Priestley in London, and who carried out public experiments in Piccadilly. Although Erdman initially rejected Brown's theory, he changed his mind shortly before writing , and ultimately came to support it. Another possibility, suggested by W.H. Stevenson, is William Nicholson, author of An Introduction to Natural Philosophy, for which Blake engraved the title page vignette in 1781. Other possibilities, suggested by Stanley Gardner, are the physician George Fordyce and the scientist Henry Cavendish. Rawlinson suggests Gass could, at least in part, be based on the botanist Joseph Banks.|$|E
