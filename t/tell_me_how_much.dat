500|$|In an {{interview}} for Chicago Music Magazine, Chloë Agnew described the lyrics of the song as [...] "really incredible". She stated that [...] "It is a songs that I listen to and wish I had written. It’s really so special. I {{think a lot of}} people have found strength and hope in the lyrics. It's been really rewarding to meet and talk to people at our meet and greet events come up and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> that song means to them and how it has helped them". Irish singer Chloë Agnew recorded the track for her debut album Chloë (2002).|$|E
500|$|By the 1951 season, media sources {{had given}} the {{nickname}} [...] "Big Four" [...] to the pitching combination of Garcia, Bob Feller, Bob Lemon and Early Wynn. Garcia had learned to control the curveball that Harder taught him in spring training of 1949. Harder said that Garcia already had a terrific fastball, but that he became a good pitcher by learning the curveball and working on his control. Cleveland sportswriter Hal Lebovitz wrote, [...] "Garcia, {{until the day he}} died, would <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the success he owed to Harder." [...] Garcia also once admitted to throwing an occasional spitball, an illegal pitch. [...] "Maybe a dozen in my life. I'm sure plenty of the great pitchers did", he said.|$|E
2500|$|Reicin {{appointed}} Karel Vaš {{as chief}} investigator in the Píka case. Reicin would later, in {{a departure from}} standard practice, name Vaš the second prosecutor at Píka's trial. According to Reicin's secretary, Vaš told Reicin: [...] "ust <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you need for Píka, fifteen years or the gallows, and the indictment can be manufactured accordingly...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bless me, {{these are}} things I never think of. I do not even know <b>how</b> <b>much</b> my own father is worth. Mother <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I may spend, and I can want to learn no more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Older, I should think, sir. You {{are always}} <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> more decorously she goes {{through all the}} honours of the tea-table. Lord, papa, what if you should give her a right to preside once and for ever!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not, sir? You {{have just}} been <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you liked to be conquered, and how {{pleasant}} over-persuasion is to you. Don't you think I had better {{take advantage of the}} confession, and begin and coax and entreat--even cry and be sulky if necessary--for the sake of a mere essay of my power?" ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{the very}} platform, {{in that moment}} of bustle, Phoebe conscientiously and {{reasonably}} began, 'Will you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you mean by that?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not, Muster Fenwick. Murder is {{a terrible}} crime. And now, if you'll <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> it was you paid the lawyer at Heytesbury--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} {{have it in}} the parcel he will send to-morrow; if you'll give me the pattern and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you want, I'll write for it." ...|$|E
5000|$|In August 2010, scenes {{reveal that}} Glenda {{already knew that}} Archie abused Ronnie as a child. Barber admitted: [...] "Viewers say to me, 'Oh she's an {{absolute}} bitch,' before <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> they love her. What's funny is that I've never played Glenda as a baddy. But the more genuine I try to make her, the more devious she appears to the audience!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{need not}} direct anybody to suppose how I {{received}} this news. I was indeed exceedingly surprised at it, and had much ado to support myself {{when the first}} part of it was delivered, though the gentleman delivered his errand with great respect, and with all the regard to me that he was able, and {{with a great deal of}} ceremony, also <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he was concerned to bring me such a message.|$|R
2500|$|In The Winning Way Dwyer writes that, [...] "I {{certainly}} did not mark him down as someone liable {{to break into the}} Test side. Although [...] Moon had withdrawn, two other wingers of proven ability were going on the New Zealand tour, Peter Grigg and Mick Martin... Campese played in a couple of the early tour matches, and as we approached the first Test a few of the senior players tried to advance his cause by <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> they admired him." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked at}} me quite earnestly for a moment, then said, [...] "And can you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> is two-an'-two-an'-two-an'-two-an'-two-an'- two?"--and several more two's all in a rapid strain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you want, and I {{will write}} {{it out for}} you," [...] said the clerk, sitting down at a table and taking up a pen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Put what ist wants, ant what ist possession? Look arount you T'ousantacres, and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of t'is fery spot you'd haf a mint to claim, {{under your}} Lort's title?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just what old Wilcox said. And of all unwarranted things! He {{said it was}} in poor taste, utterly profitless, anyway, and not {{in harmony}} with {{university}} traditions and policy. He said much {{more of the same}} vague sort, and I couldn't pin him down to anything specific. I made it pretty awkward for him, and he could only go on repeating himself and <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he honored <b>me,</b> and all the world honored me, as a scientist. It wasn't an agreeable task for him. I could see he didn't like it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Kindly <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> again, papa, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money I {{have in my}} {{very own}} right. You have often told me before, but I always forget figures." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, your chicquing it, you're faking it," [...] said Mrs. March, {{borrowing}} the verbs severally {{from the}} art editor and the publisher of Every Other Week. [...] "You have got to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> just <b>how</b> <b>much</b> and <b>how</b> little there really is of her before I go any further with them. Is she stupid?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me {{tell you}} another time," [...] he begged. [...] "I have looked forward so to these few minutes with you. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> time {{you are going to}} spare me this next week?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, don't let's bother {{about that}} yet, {{if it means}} a lecture," [...] he begged. [...] "You shall <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> better the young women of your country behave than the young women of mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} the {{contents}} of that tumbler? I shall be delighted {{to give it to}} you, and you must <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you take." [...] And Basil Ransom, getting up, possessed himself of the glass on the table.|$|E
6000|$|I {{pretended to}} {{consider}} the matter deeply, she watching my anxious and labouring countenance with a devouring and delighted interest; and when, at last, I gave it up and begged her to appease my longing by <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> herself <b>how</b> <b>much</b> this polar Vanderbilt was worth, she put her mouth close to my ear and whispered, impressively: ...|$|R
6000|$|The Inspector {{drew his}} chair nearer. [...] "Now, Miss Callingham," [...] {{he said in}} a very serious voice, [...] "that's a {{remarkable}} expression--like a flash of lightning.' Bear in mind, {{this is a matter of}} life and death to somebody somewhere. Somebody's neck may depend upon your answers. Will you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> exactly <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you remember?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope I {{may know}} her some day. You {{are so much}} there now, uncle; I wonder whether you ever mention me to them. If you do, <b>tell</b> her from <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I grieve for her." ...|$|R
60|$|CAPT. G. When you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of you was {{eighteen}} last birthday {{and how much}} is as old as the Sphinx and twice as mysterious, perhaps I'll attend to you. Lend me that banjo. The spirit moveth me to jowl at the sunset.|$|E
60|$|Consider {{that also}} that {{is written in}} the Proverbs: A good man leaveth an Inheritance to his childrens children, and {{the wealth of the}} sinner is laid up for the just. {113e} What then doth he get thereby, that getteth by dishonest means? why he getteth Sin and Wrath, Hell and Damnation: and now <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he doth get.|$|E
60|$|Consider {{that also}} {{that it is}} written in the Proverbs; 'A good man leaveth an {{inheritance}} to his children's children, and {{the wealth of the}} sinner is laid up for the just' (Prov 13:22).

6000|$|... "Each one of {{them may}} have some other one or some two whom he may insist on {{bringing}} with him," [...] said the elder Duke; [...] "and though of course you cannot yield to the pressure in every such case, it will be wise to allow yourself scope for some amount of concession. You'll find they'll shake down after the usual amount of resistance and compliance. No;--don't you leave your house to-morrow to see anybody unless it be Mr. Daubeny or her Majesty. I'll come to you at two, and if her Grace will give me luncheon, I'll lunch with her. Good night, and don't think {{too much of the}} bigness of the thing. I remember dear old Lord Brock <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> more difficult it was to find a good coachman than a good Secretary of State." [...] The Duke of Omnium, as he sat thinking of things for the next hour in his chair, succeeded only in proving to himself that Lord Brock never ought to have been Prime Minister of England after having ventured to make so poor a joke on so solemn a subject.|$|R
60|$|With {{this same}} man, Mr. Spugg, I have often talked {{of the problem}} of wealth. He is a self-made man and he has told me again and again that the wealth he has {{accumulated}} is a mere burden to him. He says that he was much happier when he had only the plain, simple things of life. Often as I sit at dinner with him over a meal of nine courses, he <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he would prefer a plain bit of boiled pork with a little mashed turnip. He says that if he had his way he would make his dinner out of a couple of sausages, fried with a bit of bread. I forgot what it is that stands in his way. I have seen Spugg put aside his glass of champagne--or his glass after he had drunk his champagne--with an expression of something like contempt. He says that he remembers a running creek {{at the back of his}} father's farm where he used to lie at full length upon the grass and drink his fill. Champagne, he says, never tasted like that. I have suggested that he should lie on his stomach on the floor of the club and drink a saucerful of soda water. But he won't.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{the little}} ones," [...] he continued, {{suddenly}} checking {{himself in his}} tirade, [...] "must not be made to suffer like the grown-up folks. They, at least, are innocent of it all. Young lady, I'd do more for the kids than I'd do for the war--and I'll do it willingly, of my own accord. <b>Tell</b> <b>me,</b> then, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money you got and I'll give you the boys' suits at cost price. I'll do more; for every five suits you buy from me at cost, I'll throw an extra one in, free--Jake Kasker's own contribution." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't," [...] she begged. [...] "You {{must leave}} it to me. I will find somewhere. And now let us be serious, Reginald. Here we are come to rather a late crisis in our lives. <b>Tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> do I really mean to you? Am I just a habit, or have you really in the {{background}} memories and thoughts about me which you seldom express?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He waved me back imperiously {{with his}} hand. [...] "It is sober sense; but I want no doctors. I have studied {{medicine}} and I {{know all about}} it. No doctors can help me. My last hour has come! For a year past I have only lived by a miracle. Now listen to me as you have never listened to anybody before; for you {{will not have the}} opportunity of getting me to repeat my words. We have been friends for two years; now <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> do you know about me?" ...|$|E
60|$|My aunts were wont to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I resembled him, being, so they said, a Montressor to the backbone; {{and this}} I took to mean commendation, for the Montressors were a well-descended and well-thought-of family, {{and the women}} were noted for their beauty. This I could well believe, since of all my aunts {{there was not one}} but was counted a pretty woman. Therefore I took heart of grace when I thought of my dark face and spindling shape, hoping that when I should be grown up I might be counted not unworthy of my race.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good gracious, Valencia! do be reasonable! You'll {{go into a}} fit, or {{somebody}} will hear you! You know how I hate a scene. Do be good, there's a darling! Why didn't you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> at first <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you wished for it, and I would have said yes in a moment." ...|$|R
60|$|The Giesbach is a {{succession}} of falls, whose water comes from a glacier, and which are produced by the sinuosities of the leaps and inclined planes of a mountain side, aided by rocks and precipices. It is very beautiful, and may well rank as {{the third or fourth}} cascade of Switzerland, for variety, volume of water, and general effect. A family has established itself among the rocks, to pick up a penny by making boxes of larch, and singing the different ranz des raches. Your mountain music does not do so well, when it has an air so seriously premeditated, and one soon gels to be a little blasé on the subject of entertainments of this sort, which can only succeed once, and then with the novice. Alas! I have actually stood before the entrance of the cathedral at Rouen, and the strongest feeling of the moment was that of surprise at the manner in which my nerves had thrilled, when it was first seen. I do not believe that childhood, with its unsophistication and freshness, affords the greatest pleasures, for every hour <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> reason and cultivation enhance our enjoyments; but there are certainly gratifications that can be felt but once; and if an opera of Rossini or Meyerbeer grows on us at each representation, or a fine poem improves on acquaintance, the singing of your Swiss nightingales is sweeter in its first notes than in its second.|$|R
6000|$|... 'In truth I cannot tell, Teule, still I {{have heard}} wise men {{say that if}} love {{is to be found}} anywhere, it is in this same {{darkness}} of death, that is light indeed. Grieve not, for if there is truth in the faith of which you have told me or in our own, either on this earth or beyond it, with the eyes of the spirit you will see your dear before another sun is set, and I pray that you may find her faithful to you. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> now, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> does she love you? Would SHE have lain by your side on the bed of sacrifice as, had things gone otherwise between us, Teule, it was my hope to do?' ...|$|R
