40|$|Till <b>Tabbas</b> (To Tabas, 1959) is Finnish-Swedish author Willy Kyrklund's (1921 - 2009) {{account of}} a journey through Iran in the 1950 s. While ostensibly the object of Kyrklund's text is modern Iran and early Islamic Persia, on an ideational level To <b>Tabbas</b> explores existential issues that are most readily {{associated}} with certain intellectual environments in post-war Europe. In one sense, the Persian "Orient" is to Kyrklund an archive of texts and images, which he uses in a discussion about {{what he sees as}} the terms of human existence. Kyrklund discusses the terms of human existence by emphasising the perceived sameness between the modern Western subject and the Persian Muslim and the masters of Sufi poetry. He uses the concept of "man" to refer to the common ground that he imagines exists between them. However, as this essay shows, "man" as an abstract category functions as a placeholder for the post-war European male intel­lectual, desperate in his longing for a higher purpose, and certain that no such higher purpose exists. This tendency of semantic ambiguity is discussed from a postcolonial perspective in the last section of this article...|$|R

Since the <b>Tabbas</b> city attracted many immigrants from surrounding especially rural areas, this study aims to analyze the relationship between social responsibility and mental health of the immigrants by using logistic regression. The research method is survey and structured questionnaire utilized as the tool. Population was the immigrants of Tabas. The sample under study were 200 immigrants. To achieve validity, formal validity and factor analysis were utilized, and Cronbach’s Alpha was used for reliability of the tool. Statistical techniques were compare mean, correlation coefficient and test of research model propelled by logistic regression. Research results shows {{the means of the}} mental health in dimension of physical is 26. 94, dimension of disruption equal with 25. 23, in the stress dimension is 20. 16 and social function is 31. 50.

Also Research results show that five variables such as residence situation, social responsibility, education, marital status and social class entered in the logistic regression equation model. The Beta equation for five variables; marital status (B=. 27), social responsibility (B=. 62), residence situation (B=. 12), education (B=. 19), age (B=. 17) were significant and could have an important role in prediction of immigrants mental health...|$|R
40|$|Nearfault {{earthquake}} motions {{have special}} characteristics {{that affect the}} response of structures. Their importance in earthquake design of civil structures was not fully realized until several failures occurred during the 1994 Northridge and 1995 Kobe earthquake events. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the effect of near fault and far fault earthquake motions on the response of reinforced concrete structures considering soilstructure interaction. In detail, a series of linear timehistory analysis was carried out for three example buildings. The effects of soilstructure interaction were evaluated for a 3 story building, a 7 story building and a 15 story building. The ordinary moment resisting frame system was considered for all example buildings as lateral forceresisting system. For all buildings timehistory analysis were performed under 3 example earthquake motions: <b>Tabbas,</b> Kobe and Loma Prieta. The buildings were supported on soft and stiff soils with 100 m/s and 900 m/s shear wave velocity respectively. For each building and earthquake record, analysis were carried out for both conditions, building supported on soft and stiff soil separately, and compared with fixed base results. For all analysis both nearfield and farfield earthquake were considered. The main evaluated parameters were period of structure, base shear, global displacement and story drifts. Results based on linear timehistory analysis had shown that considering the soilstructure interaction increases period of structure and story drifts and also had noticeable and significant effects on global displacement and base shear.

40|$|The nypa palm, {{like the}} coconut palm, is a tree all of whose parts have uses {{including}} {{everything from the}} leaves down to the roots. Its uses range from food, medicine and as a material for construction and industry, not to mention its environmental, ecological and socio-cultural uses. In many areas in Southeast Asia before World War Two, its products were highly traded commodities. At present, nypa palm/mangrove {{is still one of}} the major sources of livelihood in many coastal towns in the Philippines and also plays a major role in the socio-cultural practices at the study area of the barangays (villages) <b>Tabba</b> and Cabaggan in Pamplona, Cagayan. These barangays are found along the tip of the Province of Cagayan and are influenced by the Kuroshio Current. However, this resource is now threatened due to over-utilization and conversion of its growth area into fishponds. Improved management of the nypa resource will increase its value to the community and will compel the population to protect it from over-utilization and prevent the imminent conversion of its habitat to other uses. Possible measures to increase the value of the resource to the community are an improvement in its utilization and advocacy to increase the community recognition and appreciation for its environmental and ecological roles. These measures can possibly be implemented through a participatory strategy. Such a strategy was therefore assessed as to its applicability in the area which also took into consideration the preparedness of the community for participatory undertakings. The results of the assessment show that community participation as a management tool is a good strategy that can be employed to manage the nypa resource and increase its value to the community. This would ultimately result in the protection not only of nypa but of the entire mangrove resource and preserve its function as a source of livelihood and a buffer against the elements including threats posed by climate change...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, several {{anti-human}} immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drugs {{have emerged in}} the clinical setting, such as nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors, and protease inhibitors. Many studies provide a positive message supporting the use of potent combination antiretroviral regimens. Use of this therapy has resulted in remarkable declines in hospitalization rates, morbidity and mortality, where the drugs are available (Hogg et al., 1997, 1998; Palella et al., 1998). However, choices for combination regimens are not a simple reflection of possible permutations derived {{from a list of}} available drugs. Practical issues such as drug compatibility, adverse effects and cross-resistance limit the options available, especially when there is drug failure and resistance (Carpenter et al., 1998). There is therefore still a demand to develop newly discovered drugs. Medicinal plants may be the source of drugs in the future, or may be important in alternative therapeutic approaches in develop-ing countries, at the centre of the AIDS pandemic. Undoubtedly, currently available drug regimens are not read-ily available in these countries for economic reasons. Extracts from the spike of Prunella vulgaris have previ-ously been analysed for anti-HIV activity, both as crude extract, and as partially purified material (Chang & Yeung, 1988). One of the purified components of this extract, prunellin, is identified as a sulphated polysaccharide that, by gel permeation chromatography and the Squire method on Sephadex G- 75, was found to be approximately 10 kDa in size (<b>Tabba</b> et al., 1989). The extract is able to inhibit signif-icantly HIV- 1 replication with relatively low cytotoxicity. Preincubation of HIV- 1 with the purified extract dramati-cally decreases its infectivity. This implies that the extract inhibits the binding of HIV to the surface of susceptible cells (Yao et al., 1992). Yamasaki and colleagues have reported that the extract inhibits the activity of HIV reverse tran-scriptase in vitro (Yamasaki et al., 1998) With a view to the clinical application of this extract, the exact mode of action, a kinetic analysis of the inhibitory activity against HIV RTase, and the possible absorption of this extract through the intestine in vivo were investigated in this study...|$|E
