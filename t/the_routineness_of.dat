T-patterns provide significant advantages over traditional sequence analyses by incorporating time. A T-pattern is characterized by a significant time window (critical interval) that describes the duration of this pattern. Our analysis is based on data collected from shadowing 10 knowledge workers over a total of 29 entire work days. We report on the statistics of detected T-patterns and derived correlations with participant perceptions of workload, autonomy, and productivity...|$|E

Although we invoke legislative supremacy with <b>the</b> <b>routineness</b> <b>of</b> intellectual boilerplate-indeed, perhaps because of this routineness-we have come to treat the precept uncritically. Characteristic of the traditional neglect of this precept is its treatment in the classic legal process materials compiled by Professors Henry Hart and Albert Sacks in the 1950 s. Although Hart and Sacks broadly recognized the lawmaking supremacy of the legislature, they marginalized that concession by presuming that legislators act as reasonable persons (i. e., like judges), and by emphasizing that the nature of lawmaking is a cooperative process of 2 ̆ 2 reasoned elaboration 2 ̆ 2 by judges, administrators, and other reasonable people who carry out the statute 2 ̆ 7 s purpose over time...|$|E
40|$|This article {{contributes}} to theory development through advancing an embodied framing of organizational routines. It addresses {{the absence of}} bodies in a literature that tends to treat the “people” involved in organizational routines as disembodied actors. One consequence {{of this is that}} progress toward a theory of “routines as practices” has tended to ignore how bodies contribute to their unfolding. Theorizing embodied communicative acts brings the body and embodiment into organizational routines research. Existing knowledge is extended by drawing from multiple empirical illustrations to explain how routines are accomplished when power is exercised through gesture and bodily movement, the spaces where routines unfold cohere with human bodies making a difference in how they are constituted and experienced, and, <b>the</b> <b>routineness</b> <b>of</b> routines is made manifest when mutual intelligibility is discerned in the silences that characterize how embodied actors interrelate...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impacts of}} new technology on university library administration as reflected in a case study. The institution chosen for the study is the University of Tasmania Library, which has recently adopted a totally integrated automated library system based on the Library's own mini-computer. The opening chapter introduces the topic, and puts forward five propositions. These include propositions {{about the use of}} new technology to reinforce the organization's niche within the parent institution; the role of technology in environmental turbulence and uncertainty; the effects of new technology on routineness, standardization, formalization and flexibility; the structural impacts of new technology; and the human and social impacts upon organization members. The chapter continues with a review of relevant literature, and concludes with a description of the methodology employed. Subsequent chapters consider the University Library in the light of each of the propositions. Two chapters are devoted to the background and particular circumstances of the organization - one on its history, nature and technology, and another on its task environment. The nature of the technology employed by the University Library is then examined in more detail in an attempt to classify it. Perrow's scale <b>of</b> <b>routineness</b> is chosen as a suitable classification scheme, and the effects of automation on <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>routineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization's technology are considered. A tendency towards increased routineness, standardization and formalization is observed, but there is little corresponding loss of flexibility. Rather, new opportunities for creativity and flexible services are noted. Structural impacts of the introduction of automated systems are examined. While the formal structure remains virtually unchanged, there are changes occurring in the informal organization. The results of a survey of organization members indicate that the human impacts of automation generally have been minor, although a small group of employees experiencing loss of job satisfaction and deteriorating social relationships is identified. Finally, the impacts observed in the case study are considered {{in the context of the}} particular circumstances of the University of Tasmania Library - its history, nature, technology, environment and management, as described in the earlier chapters - and concludes that these are all contributing factors to the nature of the impacts of the introduction of new automated systems in the particular organization...|$|R
40|$|In {{contemporary}} cosmopolitanism research, {{cities are}} iconic places where cosmopolitan exchanges and actors find their ‘natural’ milieu. Farmers {{not only are}} remarkably absent from this literature but have been depicted as operating with a highly localist and agrarian world view and being strongly connected {{to the land and}} the farm through history, biography and family tradition. In this paper, we present findings from a three-year study of entrepreneurial family farmers who are globally engaged and undertake extensive mobility as part of their farm business practices. The paper shows how they readily display some of the key hallmarks of contemporary cosmopolitanism: they are highly mobile and frequently engage in <b>the</b> <b>routineness</b> <b>of</b> international travel; they understand the strategic significance of cultural sensitivities and competencies; and they gain pleasure from engaging with difference. Yet, we suggest that these expressions of cosmopolitanism are also contradictory and, at times, may be understood as either ‘instrumental’, ‘banal’ or ‘engaged’. The paper illustrates how ordinary and everyday cosmopolitan repertoires and sentiments can arise outside the usual settings and among actors not readily acknowledged in the cosmopolitanism literature...|$|E
30|$|Conflict {{can both}} be {{functional}} and dysfunctional [39], and while research agrees about the dysfunctional nature of affective conflict (e.g., [9]), research on cognitive conflict has produced differing results. While most researchers suggest that cognitive conflict is generally harmful to cooperation (e.g., [34, 40]), some view the effect as contingent to <b>the</b> <b>routineness</b> <b>of</b> the task [10, 41]. Here, the argumentation {{is that in}} complex tasks such as innovation and strategic decision-making that require out-of-the-box thinking, cognitive conflict is positive as disagreements and the associated friction create new ideas and trigger improvement of the task [10, 21, 41]. In contrast, in routine tasks that are characterized by {{a low level of}} variability and high repetitiveness [42], dissent is counterproductive as its management is time consuming and frustrating [41]. This is consistent with the empirical findings for horizontal LSP alliances, where [43] show that conflict only can be positive in the non-routine field of innovation generation, provided that functionality of conflict is high, and otherwise is negative. Knowing that conflicts heavily influence key outcomes of horizontal cooperation, {{it is important to understand}} the formation of conflicts and how they can be counteracted before they manifest themselves and show their negative sides.|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores {{experiences}} of mobility in Peru {{with a particular}} focus on the dynamics of family relationships. Over the past decade the ‘migration and development’ debate has gained prominence in academic and policy circles. The debate has focused on international migration {{and there is an}} identified need for movements within countries to be revisited, especially given that the majority of poor people in developing countries move within rather than between countries. A further limitation has been the focus on economic dimensions of development particularly in terms of the impact of remittance flows. An emergent argument in the literature supports a holistic notion of development and within this support for a wellbeing perspective is gaining momentum (IOM, 2013; Wright, 2010, 2011, 2012; Wright and Black, 2011). The distinctiveness of a wellbeing approach lies in its emphasis on people’s own perceptions and {{experiences of}} life (White, 2010). Wellbeing is understood to incorporate the material, relational and subjective dimensions of life and the interplay between these. Emphasis is placed on the socio-cultural context in shaping these dimensions of wellbeing. The study employs wellbeing as a ‘sensitising lens’ to explore people’s perceptions and experiences of mobility in Peru with a focus on the dynamics of family relationships. The research explores experiences of mobile lives from the perspective of poor urban residents of a ‘human settlement’ on the outskirts of Lima, the capital. This is supplemented with interviews with residents of rural, peri-urban and urban communities of the highlands [sierra]. The thesis points to <b>the</b> necessity and <b>routineness</b> <b>of</b> mobility in <b>the</b> search ‘to get ahead’ [salir adelante]. Central to understanding experiences of mobility is the dynamic of how people anchor relationally. ‘Relational anchoring’ (Auyero and Swistun, 2008) reflects a sense of togetherness [estar juntos] and closeness [estar unidos] in family and is based on relations of cariño [affection, warmth and love]. The thesis details the struggle surrounding the establishment of anchoring routines (phone calls, visits and ‘sending’), especially when anchoring to kin relations (parents and siblings in particular) and to ones immediate family (partner and children) create competing demands on limited resources. Senses of wellbeing in experiences of mobility are expressed through the contrasting emotions of pena [sorrow] and being tranquilo/a [content]. Pena expresses a sense of disruption in relationships and conveys the socio-cultural meaning of separation and living apart from kin. Narratives of an enduring pena and isolation are predominantly female narratives and reveal the significance of the relational circumstances of mobility in shaping experiences which are marked by ambiguity and vulnerability...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} years, {{the number of}} location-based {{applications}} have been increasing due {{to the advancement of}} mobile computing technology and the sensors built in the mobile devices. These applications grant individuals to locate one another, and benefit from services and information those are delivered according to individuals’ location. However, despite the popularity of location-based applications, they are increasingly criticised for putting user privacy at risk by disclosing location data mistakenly to undesired parties. Adapting and predicting changes of user’s sharing attitude over time in order to overcome possible leakages, presents challenging problem for location-based applications and location privacy approaches. In this thesis, we extended an existing work on detecting routine and out-of-routine location events of a user based on entropy estimation, to present a control mechanism that can discover correlation between sharing behaviour and <b>routineness</b> <b>of</b> a location for individuals. It is designed as supportive mechanism that aims to prevent possible leakage induced by location privacy approaches. We additionally extended an existing policy generation algorithm to evaluate proposed control mechanism by identifying optimal privacy preferences for users. The proposed approaches were evaluated and implemented in Python environment. We ran simulations with different metrics to test the overall performance of the system...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} for using seismograms in a linear inversion process {{to recover the}} seismic moment tensor has been theorized for sometime. Unfortunately, practical application of the theory is difficult. Lateral variations of the Earth and imprecise knowledge of the source often severely contaminate real seismic data relative to synthetic models which must be supplied. This paper outlines an experiment which minimizes the contamination sufficiently to permit a success-ful inversion yet retains much of the data's sensitivity to source parameters. <b>Routineness</b> <b>of</b> technique was maintained in data selection and preparation by an unambiguous on-line windowing of P phases from the SRO network. Duplicate preparation of the theoretical P phases assured their synchronization with the observations. A time domain weighted least-squares inversion was implemented including double couple and nondouble couple constraints. Estimates {{of the total variance}} in addition to variances of the moment tensor eigenvalues and eigenvectors were returned, forming the basis for statistical tests. Seismic moments of 1. 4 _+ 0. 4, 2. 8 _ 0. 3, and 2. 7 __. 0. 2 x 1027 dyne-cm were found for the Oaxaca, Mexico earthquake of November 1978, using 10 P phases in the distance ranges 20 to 120 °, 25 to 120 °, and 40 to 120 °, respectively. Corre-sponding azimuth and dips of the probable slip vector are 21. 5 °, 11. 8 °; 30. 3 °, 9. 3 °; and 32. 1 °, 9. 0 °. No evidence was found to support the hypothesis that unconstrained source models fit the data significantly better than a double couple. We believe an automated procedure such as this is a viable means for the routine recovery and cataloging of earthquake sources. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this dissertation examines the impacts of trade from low-wage countries on U. S. labor markets. Analysis explores how imports from low-wage countries influence the wages of workers with high- and low-levels of education and how such trade {{may be related to}} growing wage inequality. Linkages between import competition and low-wage imports at the national level are extended to individual census regions to provide some of the first sub-national data linking trade and wage inequality. Standard models of trade impacts by education-skill categories also are extended to capture the influence of task-based characteristics of work. Finally, the effects of import competition from low-wage countries on the likelihood of plant closure are examined. Engaging with the most recent theoretical models of trade, the empirical analysis {{presented in this}} dissertation uses detailed microdata from the U. S. Census Bureau. Those data are used to link individual workers to manufacturing plants and firms. The resulting employer-employee files are appended with data on the task characteristics of different occupations and with measures of import competition built-up from individual trade transaction data. The result {{is one of the most}} comprehensive datasets yet built connecting measures of trade to the characteristics of jobs, workers and business establishments spanning the years 1992 - 2007. Analysis of these data yields insights into the socially and spatially uneven consequences of trade. This dissertation finds that low-wage import competition is significantly related to increased inequality, driving down wages for workers with low levels of formal education and driving up wages for workers with high levels of education. The results indicate that import competition increases the nonproduction worker share of total wages within establishments, another measure of wage inequality related to differences in worker skills/education. It also reveals that the relationship between wage inequality and low-wage import competition varies substantially across U. S. regions. Furthermore, this dissertation finds that task intensity measures <b>of</b> <b>routineness,</b> complexity, and interpersonal interaction in a worker's occupation significantly mediate the effect of low-wage import competition on workers' wages. It also finds that low-wage import competition significantly raises the likelihood of manufacturing plant closure...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. January 2010. Major: Human Resources and Industrial Relations. Advisors: Connie R. Wanberg, Mary E. Zellmer-Bruhn. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 187 pages, appendices A-C. Transactive memory system (TMS) theory {{has attracted a}} lot of attention in understanding expertise recognition and utilization in work teams in recent years. However, the literature has been mainly focusing on the direct effects of TMS on team performance, leaving the effects on other team outcomes as well as the contingent factors of these effects largely unknown (Lewis, 2003). In addition, according to a recent review by Kozlowski and Ilgen (2006), the literature, featuring an emerging field, needs development on clarifying the definition of the construct and identifying antecedents that contribute to the establishment of TMS. To address these limitations and to advance our understandings of TMS, in this dissertation, I first clarified and synthesized the divergent dimensions of TMS by proposing a two-higher-order-component framework, i. e. TMS structure and TMS manifestation. Based on a revised model, I argued that TMS structure is captured by TMS specialization, sharedness, and accuracy, and TMS manifestation captured by TMS credibility and coordination. Using this framework, I tried to answer three questions: (1) What relationships does TMS structure (specialization, sharedness, accuracy) have with team outcomes (performance, innovation, commitment) and are these relationships mediated by TMS manifestation (credibility and coordination) ? (2) Do the relationships between TMS manifestation and team outcomes differ among teams with different task characteristics (i. e. task interdependence, task <b>routineness,</b> and alignment <b>of</b> task assignment) ? And (3) Do functional diversity, status characteristics (i. e. average levels of task-related and non-task-related status characteristic cues), and interpersonal connections (closeness and communication frequency) in teams predict TMS structure and TMS manifestation? Using a sample of 92 charter school boards and 90 school directors, I conducted hierarchical ordinary least square (OLS) regressions. Results showed that, as predicted, TMS credibility and coordination mediated the positive relationships between TMS specialization and board performance and innovation rated by both the charter school directors and the board chairs as well as board commitment. In addition, TMS credibility mediated the positive relationships between TMS sharedness and school director-rated board performance and innovation as well as board commitment. Also as predicted, task interdependence moderated the relationships between TMS credibility and director- and chair-rated performance, director-rated innovation, and board commitment such that the positive relationships were stronger when task interdependence was high than when it was low. Task interdependence moderated the relationships between TMS coordination and director-rated performance and innovation and board commitment in the same fashion. Task <b>routineness</b> moderated <b>the</b> relationships between TMS credibility and director-rated performance and innovation such that the relationships were positive when the tasks were highly routine and negative when the tasks were non-routine. Task routinesness also moderated the relationships between TMS credibility and board commitment in the same fashion as task interdependence does. The average levels of task-related status cues positively predicted TMS specialization, the average levels of non-task-related status cues positively predicted TMS sharedness, and both status characteristics predicted TMS accuracy. Additionally, the levels of interpersonal v closeness among board members were positively related to TMS accuracy as well as TMS credibility and coordination. Contributions, practical implications, limitations and future research are discussed...|$|R
