5|$|Early beefsteaks {{were held}} in a relaxed, men-only atmosphere, with diners sitting on crates and eating with their fingers off of rough, improvised tables in saloons, rental halls, or {{residential}} basements. Food and drink were {{the focus of the}} evening, and entertainment often consisted simply of those present <b>telling</b> <b>stories</b> and singing amongst themselves.

5|$|From January until March 1686, La Salle {{and most}} of his men searched {{overland}} for the Mississippi River, traveling towards the Rio Grande, possibly as far west as modern-day Langtry, Texas. The men questioned the local Native American tribes, asking for information on the locations of the Spaniards and the Spanish mines, offering gifts, and <b>telling</b> <b>stories</b> that portrayed the Spanish as cruel and the French as benevolent. When the group returned, they were unable to find the Belle where they had left her and were forced to walk back to the fort.|$|E

Though some of these works are contemporaneous to Sankardeva's, they hark back to older forms free of Sankardeva's influences and so are considered pre-Sankardeva literature. [...] The Oja-palis follow two different traditions: biyah-gowa which <b>tells</b> <b>stories</b> from the Mahabharata and Maroi, which <b>tells</b> <b>stories</b> on the snake goddess Manaxa.

5|$|Hines led John Hunt Morgan back to Confederate lines. First, {{they arrived}} at the train station in {{downtown}} Columbus, where they bought tickets to Cincinnati, Ohio. The duo jumped off the train before it entered the Cincinnati train station. They continued to evade capture in Cincinnati, staying for one night at the Ben Johnson House in Bardstown, Kentucky. In Tennessee, Hines diverted the Union troops' attention away from John Hunt Morgan, and was himself recaptured and sentenced to death by hanging.

A few days later he again escaped Union soldiers who intended to hang him.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Jingeling, the Keeper of the Keys to Santa's Workshop, {{was created}} in 1956 as a radio {{spokesman}} to promote the toys sold at Halle's Department Store in Cleveland, Ohio. Mr. Jingeling was immediately popular and became an annual fixture at Halle's where he prowled the seventh floor toy department entertaining shoppers. The costumed character was first played by Max Ellis, a Cleveland Play House actor, and then by Earl W. Keyes, a television producer and director, who remained with the role for many years. In addition to his department store duties, Mr. Jingeling appeared on a local children's television program <b>telling</b> <b>stories,</b> singing songs, and reminding viewers to visit Halle's.|$|E

30|$|The {{simple answer}} {{is that we are}} humans and we need to <b>tell</b> <b>stories.</b> We need to <b>tell</b> <b>stories</b> that glorify the human estate. We need heroes. We need to imagine that human actions made a difference. Leaders are part of the classic story by which we come to imagine that. We <b>tell</b> <b>stories</b> about leaders and leaders <b>tell</b> <b>stories</b> about {{themselves}} that allow us to imagine that we control an uncontrollable world. That’s very good. I think, if you could just imagine – suppose you had a choice, a world that’s uncontrollable – would you rather imagine that you could control it, or give up? For me, the human being who imagines he or she can control it is a more attractive human being.|$|R

I'd like some supper. In exchange, I'll <b>tell</b> you a <b>story.</b> Once upon a time there were two apes.' And I'd <b>tell</b> them a <b>story</b> about two cavemen." ...|$|R
5|$|Vandersteen was creatively active {{from his}} youth. He drew {{pictures}} with crayons on sidewalks, and invented stories {{for his friends}} about knights and legends. He even convinced his young friends to buy him crayons so he could depict the local cycling championship. At school as well, he {{was more interested in}} <b>telling</b> <b>stories</b> and learning about art than anything else. His best memory of these schooldays is of a teacher who introduced him to the works of Pieter Brueghel. Outside school, {{he spent most of his}} time with comic magazines and adventure books by Jules Verne or books about Nick Carter and Buffalo Bill. At 13, he enrolled at the Academie voor Schone Kunsten in Antwerp to study sculpture, and two years later he started working as sculptor and decorator, just like his father.|$|E
5|$|Bartender Sam Malone (Ted Danson) {{has been}} jealous {{of his brother}} Derek, who is more successful, better-educated, multi-talented and handsome, for years, and discovers that he is {{arriving}} in Boston on his private jet. Meanwhile, co-bartender Coach (Nicholas Colasanto) is offered a coaching job in Venezuela requiring fluency in Spanish. Derek (an unseen character voiced by George Ball) arrives unexpectedly {{at the bar and}} entertains the patrons with his talents, which include singing, playing a pool table, tap dancing and <b>telling</b> <b>stories.</b> Derek offers a job to regular patron Norm (George Wendt), teaches Coach Spanish (increasing his chances of being hired) and impresses waitress Diane (Shelley Long) with their common interests. Diane and Derek pair off (which bothers Sam). During his date with Debbie (Deborah Shelton), Sam hears Derek's private jet, where he carries Diane along.|$|E
5|$|The {{power of}} stories to {{entertain}} {{is evident in}} one of the most famous ones—Scheherazade—a story in the Persian professional storytelling tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by <b>telling</b> <b>stories.</b> The connections between the different types of entertainment are shown by the way that stories like this inspire a retelling in another medium, such as music, film or games. For example, composers Rimsky-Korsakov, Ravel and Szymanowski have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it into an orchestral work; director Pasolini made a film adaptation; and there is an innovative video game based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in music, dance or puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of wayang, in which the performance is accompanied by a gamelan orchestra or the similarly traditional Punch and Judy show.|$|E
5000|$|Language- Language is {{a second}} {{prevalent}} theme within this novel. The language is either conveyed through direct translation or inserted within a sentence. An {{example of this is}} the storytelling. Nokomis and Deydey are two of the characters who <b>tell</b> <b>stories.</b> According to Sabra McIntosh, “They pass on family history, folklore, superstitions and customs. Nokomis <b>tells</b> <b>stories</b> in the cold of winter. Deydey <b>tells</b> <b>stories</b> whenever he is home usually about his travels. The family and especially the children relish <b>story</b> <b>telling</b> time. We know from the author’s notes that Ojibwa was a spoken, not written, language. Their history and identity survives through such story telling.” ...|$|R

5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} team sent {{north on}} the evening of July 5 reported seeing tanks south of Osan. The team attempted to destroy a tank it spotted in the village of Sojong but was unsuccessful; it suffered one killed (Private Kenneth R. Shadrick) and was forced to return to Pyongtaek. Shortly after, several survivors from Task Force Smith arrived at 1st Battalion's command post <b>telling</b> <b>stories</b> of their defeat at Osan, but Ayres did not believe they were accurate. Brigadier General George B. Barth, acting division artillery commander for the 24th Infantry Division, stopped by the command post and ordered that the battalion hold only as long as it could, and not to risk being flanked or surrounded, wary of the defeat at Osan. Barth then moved to the 34th Infantry Regiment's command where he ordered regimental commander Colonel Jay B. Lovless to consolidate the Regiment at Cheonan to the south. Lovless subsequently moved 3rd Battalion south, without having ever engaged the enemy. Barth believed the 34th Infantry {{would not be able to}} defend Pyongtaek as long as the 21st Infantry defended Osan. From 3rd Battalion, L Company was detached and ordered to hold south of Pyongtaek to cover the 1st Battalion when it retreated. This order was not carried out, and L Company left for Chonan.|$|E
5|$|Kor (John Colicos), a revered Klingon warrior, is in Quark's Bar <b>telling</b> <b>stories</b> of past battles to {{his friend}} Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell). She notices Lieutenant Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) nearby and invites him to meet Kor, who greets Worf happily, saying that anyone who is so {{strongly}} disliked by the Klingon government {{is a friend of}} his. He explains to Jadzia and Worf that he is on the station as part of his plan to find the legendary Sword of Kahless. The sword is the original bat'leth, used by Kahless to defeat the tyrant Molor. Kor received a shroud from a Vulcan science team, which he believes once held the Sword. He gives it to Jadzia to test the shroud's authenticity. As he returns to his quarters, Kor is attacked by a Lethean who reads his thoughts in order to find out about the Sword and then removes his memories of the attack. Jadzia finds him the following morning, and thinks that he has passed out from too much alcohol. She has verified the authenticity of the shroud. Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) lends the trio a Runabout to travel into the Gamma Quadrant to search for the sword on a planet where the Vulcan team found the shroud.|$|E

5000|$|Missionaries {{have their}} own set of folklore. According to William Wilson, missionaries <b>tell</b> <b>stories</b> for four main purposes: to build a sense of comradeship, {{to cope with the}} {{pressures}} of missionary life, to encourage missionaries to keep mission rules, and to assure themselves of future victory. They commonly <b>tell</b> <b>stories</b> about how new missionaries, or [...] "greenies" [...] are initiated into the existing missionary group through pranks. Learning missionary slang also helps new missionaries feel like part of the missionary community. Missionaries also <b>tell</b> <b>stories</b> to escape from the pressures of strict missionary life; often these stories include ways that missionaries try escape missionary life but are discovered. The third reason missionaries <b>tell</b> <b>stories</b> is to help them conform to mission rules. In some of these stories a missionary disobeys the rules and suffers disastrous consequences. Other <b>stories</b> <b>tell</b> of missionaries miraculously saved from danger. Missionaries also <b>tell</b> <b>stories</b> about getting the best of a hostile world, even if it causes other people to suffer. Stories where people insult missionaries, only to come to an untimely end, are common. In some missions, it is common to burn clothing to mark special missionary anniversaries, such as a tie after six months of service and a shirt after one year.|$|R

40|$|Embodiment. This {{construct}} and process {{are central to}} ecosocial theory and epidemiological inquiry. Recognising that we, as humans, are simultaneously social beings and biological organisms, the notion of "embodiment" advances three critical claims: (1) bodies <b>tell</b> <b>stories</b> about—and cannot be studied divorced from—the conditions of our existence; (2) bodies <b>tell</b> <b>stories</b> that often—but not always—match people's stated accounts; and (3) bodies <b>tell</b> <b>stories</b> that people cannot or will not tell, either because they are unable, forbidden, or choose not to tell. Just as the proverbial "dead man's bones" do in fact tell tales, via forensic pathology and historical anthropometry, so too do our living bodies <b>tell</b> <b>stories</b> about our lives, {{whether or not these}} are ever consciously expressed. This glossary sketches some key concepts, definitions, and hypotheses relevant for using the construct of "embodiment" in epidemiological research, so as to promote not only rigorous science but also social equity in health...|$|R
