The procedure can answer by analogy to class’membership queries on the grounds of the classification of a number of training instances (the nearest ones w. r. t. the semi-distance measure).

In the experimentation, where we compare the procedure to a logical reasoner, we show that it can be quite accurate and augment the scope of its applicability, outperforming previous prototypes that adopted other semantic measures. ...|$|E

The genomic DNA G+C content was about 37 mol%. Strain m 4 - 4 T exhibited minimal or no growth on most sugars tested. Its major cellular fatty acids were C 14 : 0, C 16 : 0 and C 18 : 1. Based on phylogenetic analysis of 16 S rRNA and recA gene sequences, we observed that the closest relatives of the isolate are moderately halophilic Bacillus species, with 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity ranging from 96. 6 to 97. 4 % (Bacillus marisflavi, Bacillus aquimaris and Bacillus vietnamensis).
