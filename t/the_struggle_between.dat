5|$|The castle was {{the focus}} of {{attention}} during the First Battle of Lincoln on 2 February 1141, during <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>between</b> King Stephen and Empress Matilda over who should be monarch in England. It was held but damaged, and a new tower, called the Lucy Tower, was built.|$|E
5|$|The Osiris myth {{reached its}} basic form in or before the 24th century BCE. Many of its {{elements}} originated in religious ideas, but <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>between</b> Horus and Set {{may have been}} partly inspired by a regional conflict in Egypt's early history or prehistory. Scholars have tried to discern {{the exact nature of}} the events that gave rise to the story, but they have reached no definitive conclusions.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>struggles</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> {{characters}} ultimately {{come down}} to <b>the</b> <b>struggles</b> <b>between</b> Nafai and Elemak, two sons of Volemak. Nafai leads the faction who {{have faith in the}} Oversoul, while Elemak leads the faction who want desperately to return to the civilization of doomed Basilica. Both are ostensibly under the leadership of Volemak (and not Rasa, as they had been in the city).|$|R

5|$|The {{candidate}} that wins {{the election and}} assumes office is eventual President of South Korea Cho Myung-ho (Lee Jung-gil). His administration begins with his undertaking the grand task of forwarding talks of reunification between the North and South after witnessing the grim reality that is <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>between</b> the two nations. With strong ambitions, he leads diplomatic outreaches with the North that no one expected of a candidate so early in his term.|$|E
5|$|The {{intervention}} in the Kievan succession crisis of 1015–1019 by the Polish ruler Bolesław Chrobry was an episode in <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>between</b> Sviatopolk I Vladimirovich ("the Accursed") and his brother Yaroslav ("the Wise") for the rulership of Kiev and Kievan Rus'. It occurred when Sviatopolk's father-in-law Bolesław, ruler of Poland, intervened on Sviatopolk's behalf.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>between</b> Basiliscus and Zeno impeded the Eastern Roman Empire's {{ability to}} {{intervene}} in the fall of the Western Roman Empire, which happened in early September 476. When the chieftain of the Heruli, Odoacer, deposed Western Emperor Romulus Augustus, sending the imperial regalia to Constantinople, Zeno had just regained his throne, and he could only appoint Odoacer dux of Italy, thereby ending the Western Roman Empire.|$|E

5|$|Theros was a plane {{inspired}} by Greek mythology, containing many references to Greek mythological {{figures such as}} Prometheus and the pantheon of gods. Tarkir {{would have been a}} plane where dragons had long since died, controlled by five clans ruled by khans. Through time travel, the result of <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>between</b> the ancient clans and the dragons was reversed and the dragons now reign over each of the five clans, which are both similar and different to their alternate-timeline predecessors.|$|E
5|$|Although As I Lay Dying {{has stated}} on {{numerous}} occasions {{that all of the}} members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. This is largely because the band's lyrics do not directly focus on pro-Christian themes the way many praise music bands do nor do they treat their music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any As I Lay Dying song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>between</b> reason and spirituality.|$|E
5|$|Although {{no longer}} {{formally}} the Count of Cotentin, Henry continued {{to control the}} west of Normandy. <b>The</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>between</b> Henry's brothers continued. William Rufus continued to put down resistance to his rule in England, but began to build a number of alliances against Robert with barons in Normandy and neighbouring Ponthieu. Robert allied himself with Philip I of France. In late 1090 William Rufus encouraged Conan Pilatus, a powerful burgher in Rouen, to rebel against Robert; Conan was supported by most of Rouen and made appeals to the neighbouring ducal garrisons to switch allegiance as well.|$|E

5|$|Benn's mother, Margaret Wedgwood Benn (née Holmes, 1897–1991), was a theologian, {{feminist and}} the founder President of the Congregational Federation. She {{was a member of}} the League of the Church Militant, which was the {{predecessor}} of the Movement for the Ordination of Women; in 1925, she was rebuked by Randall Davidson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, for advocating the ordination of women. His mother's theology had a profound influence on Benn, as she taught him that the stories in the Bible were based around <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>between</b> the prophets and the kings and that he ought in his life to support the prophets over the kings, who had power, as the prophets taught righteousness.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 18th century, {{the society}} of the kingdom {{followed}} age-old and deeply established norms of social interaction between people. Accounts by contemporaneous travellers indicate the widespread practice of the Hindu caste system and of animal sacrifices during the nine-day celebrations (called Mahanavami). Later, fundamental changes occurred due to <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>between</b> native and foreign powers. Though wars between the Hindu kingdoms and the Sultanates continued, the battles between native rulers (including Muslims) and the newly arrived British took centre stage. The spread of English education, the introduction of the printing press and the criticism of the prevailing social system by Christian missionaries helped make the society more open and flexible. The rise of modern nationalism throughout India also affected Mysore.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Constitution of the Roman Republic is {{a study of the}} ancient Roman Republic that traces the {{progression}} of Roman political development from the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 BC until the founding of the Roman Empire in 27 BC. The constitutional {{history of the}} Roman Republic can be divided into five phases. The first phase began with the revolution which overthrew the Roman Kingdom in 510 BC, and the final phase ended with the revolution which overthrew the Roman Republic, and thus created the Roman Empire, in 27 BC. Throughout the history of the republic, the constitutional evolution was driven by <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>between</b> the aristocracy and the ordinary citizens.|$|E

5|$|As per his contract, Webber {{started the}} year in Melbourne with Red Bull Racing. He {{recorded}} top-six lap times {{in each of the}} three practice sessions, and was on his way to the top ten in the qualifying session when the front right brake disc in his car failed going into turn 6 during Q2, sending him spinning off into the sand trap ending his qualifying session, and resulting in 15th position on the grid. Although starting well, he momentarily went off the track at turn 1 to avoid being involved in contact that had already erupted. Webber made several positions by turn 3 but an incident involving himself, Kazuki Nakajima and Anthony Davidson when he was slightly contacted by Davidson whilst trying to avoid <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>between</b> the other two drivers, ended his race.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the story, Osiris rules Egypt, having {{inherited}} the kingship from his ancestors in a lineage stretching back to the creator of the world, Ra or Atum. His queen is Isis, who, along with Osiris and his murderer Set, is one of the children of the earth god Geb and the sky goddess Nut. Little information about the reign of Osiris appears in Egyptian sources; the focus is on his death and the events that follow. Osiris is connected with life-giving power, righteous kingship, and the rule of maat, the ideal natural order whose maintenance was a fundamental goal in ancient Egyptian culture. Set is closely associated with violence and chaos. Therefore, the slaying of Osiris symbolizes <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>between</b> order and disorder, and the disruption of life by death.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Griffiths {{focused on the}} {{inconsistent}} portrayal of Horus and Set as brothers and as uncle and nephew. He argued that, {{in the early stages}} of Egyptian mythology, <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>between</b> Horus and Set as siblings and equals was originally separate from the murder of Osiris. The two stories were joined into the single Osiris myth sometime before the writing of the Pyramid Texts. With this merging, the genealogy of the deities involved and the characterization of the Horus–Set conflict were altered so that Horus is the son and heir avenging Osiris's death. Traces of the independent traditions remained in the conflicting characterizations of the combatants' relationship and in texts unrelated to the Osiris myth, which make Horus the son of the goddess Nut or the goddess Hathor rather than of Isis and Osiris. Griffiths therefore rejected the possibility that Osiris's murder was rooted in historical events. This hypothesis has been accepted by more recent scholars such as Jan Assmann and George Hart.|$|E

5|$|It has {{peaked in}} the top twenty of the United States and Canada, {{becoming}} Drake's fourth consecutive top twenty hit in the U.S. It also charted with{{in the top}} five on the U.S. R and rap charts, becoming Drake's fourth consecutive top five on those respective charts. The song has also charted in the United Kingdom and its R chart. The song's accompanying music video features Drake reflecting on an experience, and <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>between</b> his old life and the new. Several artists have made a freestyle over the track, including Eminem, Trey Songz, and Diggy Simmons, among others. Drake performed the song a number of times, including at the 2010 MuchMusic Video Awards. The track received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. The song is also featured on the NBA 2K11 soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|Relations were hostile {{with both}} Sweden and Denmark from the start. During his rivalry with Earl Skule, Skule {{attempted}} {{to gain the}} support of Valdemar II of Denmark, but any aid was made impossible after Valdemar's capture {{by one of his}} vassals. Since the Danes wanted overlordship of Norway and supported the Guelphs (those supporting the Pope over the Holy Roman Emperor), Haakon in turn sought closer ties with the Ghibelline Emperor Frederick II, who sent ambassadors to Norway. As Haakon had gained a powerful reputation due to the strength of his fleet, other European rulers wanted to benefit from his friendship. Despite <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>between</b> the Pope and the Emperor, Haakon was able to maintain friendships with both. According to an English chronicler, the Pope wanted Haakon to become Holy Roman Emperor. It has been suggested that Haakon hesitated to leave Norway due to the Mongol threat.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{government}} was headed by two consuls, elected annually by the citizens and advised by a senate composed of appointed magistrates. As Roman society was very hierarchical by modern standards, {{the evolution of}} the Roman {{government was}} heavily influenced by <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>between</b> the patricians, Rome's land-holding aristocracy, who traced their ancestry to the founding of Rome, and the plebeians, the far more numerous citizen-commoners. Over time, the laws that gave patricians exclusive rights to Rome's highest offices were repealed or weakened, and leading plebeian families became full members of the aristocracy. The leaders of the Republic developed a strong tradition and morality requiring public service and patronage in peace and war, making military and political success inextricably linked. Many of Rome's legal and legislative structures (later codified into the Justinian Code, and again into the Napoleonic Code) can still be observed throughout Europe and much of the world in modern nation states and international organizations.|$|E
