40|$|In this study, the {{disinfection}} byproduct formation potential (DBPFP) {{of three}} surface waters with the {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) content of 2. 5, 5. 2, and 7. 9 mg/L was investigated. The formation and distribution of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids were evaluated. Samples collected from three surface waters in China were fractionated based on molecular weight and hydrophobicity. The raw water containing more hydrophobic (Ho) fraction exhibited higher formation potentials of haloacetic acid and trihalomethane. The DBPFP of the surface waters did not correlate with the DOC value. The values of DBPFP per DOC were correlated with the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) for Ho and Hi fractions. The obtained results suggested that SUVA cannot reveal the ability of reactive sites to form disinfection byproducts for waters with few aromatic structures. Combined with the analysis of FTIR and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the raw waters and the corresponding fractions, {{it was concluded that}} the Ho fraction with phenolic hydroxyl and conjugated double bonds was responsible for the production of <b>trichloromethanes</b> and trichloroacetic acids. The Hi fraction with amino and carboxyl groups had the potential to form dichloroacetic acids and chlorinated trihalomethanes. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R
