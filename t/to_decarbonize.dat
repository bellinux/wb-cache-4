40|$|Transportation {{accounts}} for a substantial share of CO 2 emissions, and decarbonizing transport {{will be necessary to}} limit global warming to below 2.

We test this hypothesis by comparing long-term transport energy demand and emission projections for China, USA and the World from five large-scale energy-economy models with respect to three climate policies. We systematically analyze mitigation levers along the chain of causality from mobility to emissions, and discuss structural differences between mitigation in transport and non-transport sectors.

40|$|Carbon pricing {{is the key}} <b>to</b> <b>decarbonizing</b> the economy, as it regulates {{emission}} flows.

If capital is underaccumulated, this implies lower costs of climate policy and a welfare improvement. We prove this beneficial investment shift from fossil stocks towards capital for {{the case of an}} emission trading scheme: specifically, we show that the higher the share of auctioned permits, the larger the beneficial investment effect. Further, the same holds for a `stock instrument', under which the right to recurrently receive emission permits is a tradable asset, making the effect robust to trade restrictions on fossil stocks.

The approach is designed to simultaneously address the shortcomings and maintain the attractive features of detailed energy sector and general equilibrium models. It also reflects common country-level energy planning processes. We illustrate the capabilities of this integrated bottom-up approach by analyzing the implications of (i) a carbon tax, (ii) liberalization of import supply restrictions in order to exploit regional hydropower potential, and (iii) a combined policy where both carbon taxes and import liberalization are pursued. For the combined scenario, our results suggest substantial emissions reductions relative to Baseline at essentially no cost to economic growth but about a one percent reduction in employment. We conclude that a regional energy strategy, anchored in hydropower, represents a potentially inexpensive approach <b>to</b> <b>decarbonizing</b> the South African economy. The strategy also has political economy attractions in that the combined approach reduces the burden of adjustment of politically sensitive sectors...|$|R

Over the past half century, energy law has endured many stranded cost experiments, each helping firms and customers adjust to a new normal. However, these past experiments have contributed to a myopic regulatory approach to past stranded cost recovery by: (1) endorsing a preference for addressing all stranded costs only after energy resource investment decisions have been made; and (2) fixating on the firm’s financial costs and protection of investors, {{rather than on the}} broader impacts of each transition for the energy system. The current transition to decarbonization is already giving rise to stranded cost claims related to existing energy assets like coal-fired and nuclear power plants. New energy infrastructure investments—such as natural gas pipelines and natural gas-fired power plants—will also face stranded cost issues once they have provided the expected bridge to a clean energy future. We see the transition to grid decarbonization as a propitious opportunity for energy law to improve its approach to stranded cost compensation for investor risks.

40|$|Abstract. Today, as {{the world}} is facing a crisis in terms of energy economization, {{different}} studies are being carried out to promote different sources renewable energy in future. The objective {{of this study is}} to promote one such extremely efficient and clean source of renewable energy – the green algae. The basic principle is – the green algae, e. g. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can photosynthetically produce molecular hydrogen under sulphur deprived conditions. They offer a biological route <b>to</b> <b>decarbonized</b> hydrogen production via a renewable source, hence strengthening hydrogen’s claim to become the sustainable fuel of the future. Molecular hydrogen is an energy carrier that has the potential to provide the clean energy required for transport, heating and electricity. The hydrogen production is initiated under anaerobic conditions when the hydrogenase enzyme is released. During normal photosynthesis the production of oxygen and hence the presence of oxygen during respiration around the microorganism inhibits the release of hydrogenase enzyme. When the anaerobic conditions prevail, the oxygen release during photosynthesis is consumed by algae itself and hence, hydrogenase is released. Experiments have shown that if the enzyme is added externally, hydrogen production increases 400 %. Algal hydrogen production does not generate any toxic or polluting by-products and could potentially offer value-added products derived from algal biomass. We conclude that as this microorganism is abundantly found on the earth (approximately 50, 000 microalgae can be caught on an average human finger easily), this non-polluting and clean source of renewable energy is very much capable of meeting with the ever increasing world’s energy requirements in the future...|$|R

The development of alcohol-fuelled engines has been mainly experimental up till now. The application of an engine cycle code valid for these fuels could help to unlock their full potential. For this reason, our research group decided to extend its in-house engine code to alcohols. This paper discusses the requirements {{for the construction of}} a two-zone thermodynamic model that can predict the power cycle, pollutant emissions and knock onset in alcohol engines. We reviewed the properties of alcohol fuels and their use in dedicated engine technology. From this information we identified the characteristics relevant to combustion engines and defined the areas the model should cover in terms of cylinder pressure, temperature, residual gas fraction, etc. Next, we investigated which building blocks of the current model will need adaptations. For the laminar burning velocity of alcohol-air mixtures, our literature review revealed a lack of data at engine-like conditions. Upon inspection of the pollutant formation models, we found that special attention should be paid to the formation of aldehydes and selected a suitable formation model. Finally we decided that a knock prediction model based on a one-step Arrhenius-type autoignition reaction is best suited for our purpose. Future work will further focus on each of these building blocks separately in order to come to a comprehensive model for the combustion of alcohols in spark-ignition engines...|$|R
