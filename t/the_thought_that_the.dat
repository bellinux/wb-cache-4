5|$|However, she {{is being}} {{followed}} by a gang, led by a furious Telugu-speaking lady. Shiva manages to lose the pursuers and decides to change the route to avoid the gang, but encounters a second gang. He realises that this gang is not following Charulatha, but himself, as they are the henchmen of a Mumbai-based gangster Baali (Milind Soman). He recalls an incident that happened some years ago in Mumbai, when he stayed there at his friend Poochi's (Jagan) house. He had beaten one of Baali's men, who had attacked him, and later Baali himself, not knowing about him and his reputation in the city, and returned to Bangalore. Both gangs are following the couple to achieve their own ends. After reaching Mumbai and experiencing a series of events, they end up at Poochi's house. Poochi finds out where the grandmother lives and Shiva brings Charulatha there. Shiva, unable to bear <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> journey is complete, leaves silently only to find Charulatha on the road. After hesitating, she reveals that her relatives had spoken ill about her parents, which prompted her leave, not wanting to push the matter further. While {{in a state of}} doubt, they are attacked by Baali's gang, who have teamed up with Jayaraman.|$|E
5|$|In February 2000, the Turnpike Authority {{gave in to}} {{the orders}} from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to have Route 92 undergo an {{environmental}} impact study, which could go up to two years, to help see if they should award the contract for construction. Opponents of the Route 92 project hailed this decision for <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> environmental impact statement (EIS) would back up their beliefs. Four months later, the Army Corps of Engineers held a meeting {{to decide what to}} take into account for the impact statement and held opinions from both the supporters and opponents of the freeway. Around this time, locals sent an editorial to News 12 New Jersey to say that Middlesex County Route 522, already a four-lane freeway, should become the primary freeway across the portion of Middlesex County. However, the Turnpike Authority replied citing that Route 522 would be inadequate to handle the amount of traffic by 2015 that Route 92 was to handle. In December 2003, the Army Corps of Engineers approved the statement and although agencies still disagreed on the wetlands issues, held public hearings in 2004.|$|E

5|$|The bridge {{continued}} to prosper through the 1920s and 1930s with a toll of one quarter {{to cross the}} bridge, with drivers of State Highway Route 6 coming along the bridge from the junction with State Highway Route 8 coming across the bridge since 1927. During the 1920s and 1930s, the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to buy out bridges along the Delaware River under the Joint Commission for the Elimination of Toll Bridges. The reconstructed bridge at Belvidere was bought by the commission for $60,000 (1920s USD) and the covered bridge at Columbia for only $50,000. Although the commission tried to buy the second-hand railroad bridge for a lower, unspecified amount, Darlington used his strong bargaining skills to raise the amount to $275,000, {{a far cry from}} the other local bridges. Residents of Knowlton Township, New Jersey rejoiced at the fact of when the bridge was bought, tolls were eliminated from the crossing. The new generation of people prospered at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> crossing the Delaware would be forever free.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{mammalian}} body {{must have}} some way of identifying introduced foreign particles first arose during World War II. Numerous theories were proposed and it wasn't until 1958 that {{the first of these}} identifying proteins was found. The first standardized naming system was established in 1968 by the WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System. HLA research didn't heat up until the 1980s when a group of researchers finally elucidated the shape of the HLA-A*02 protein (just one of many specific HLA proteins). Even more recently, in 2010, the WHO committee responsible for naming all HLA proteins revised their standards for naming to introduce more clarity and specificity in the naming system. It started with a plane crash in the height of the London Blitz. The pilot suffered severe burns requiring skin grafts. However, at the time skin grafts were a risky business, often being rejected for unknown reasons. The search for a reason spanned the next four decades and in some areas is still continuing today.|$|E
500|$|The cantata {{is based}} on a song of penitence, [...] "", [...] in six stanzas by Johannes Gigas (1561), sung to the melody of [...] "". The hymn is only distantly related to the readings, concentrating on <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Christians sin and deserve punishment, but may be raised to joy in a [...] "" [...] (blessed death). An unknown poet kept the first, third and sixth stanza as {{movements}} 1, 4 and 7 of the cantata. He derived movements 2 and 3, aria and recitative, from stanza 2, movement 5, another aria, from stanza 4, and the last recitative from stanza 5. In movement 3, he deviated from the song text, expanding in connection to the pospel that sin in general is comparable to the dropsy, [...] "" [...] (this sinful dropsy leads to destruction and will be fatal to you), and alluding to Adam's fall, caused by self-exaltation in the forbidden quest to be like God, [...] "" [...] (Pride first ate the forbidden fruit, to be like God).|$|E

500|$|The {{prescribed}} readings for New Years Day, {{which also}} celebrated {{the naming of}} Jesus eight days after his birth, were from the Epistle to the Galatians, [...] "by faith we inherit" [...] (...) , and from the Gospel of Luke, the Circumcision and naming of Jesus (...) [...] The text was written by Picander and published in 1728 {{in a collection of}} texts for all occasions of the liturgical year. Picander included for the first movement a verse from Psalm 48 ( [...] in the King James version, otherwise verse 11). He used as the closing chorale the second stanza from Johannes Hermann's hymn [...] "". Picander's poetry is focused on the name of Jesus, similarly to Bach's later cantata for the same occasion, Part IV of his Christmas Oratorio. The biblical quotation from the Old Testament already mentions the name of God. The first recitative adds <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name of Jesus is a gift for the New Year. The second aria contemplates that the name of Jesus, being the first word in the new year, should also be the last in the hour of death.

[...] The final movement combines prayers and hopes for the new year.|$|E
500|$|Laserblast has {{received}} largely negative reviews, and consistently {{ranks among the}} Bottom 100 list of films on the Internet Movie Database. A 1978 critique in The Review of the News said, [...] "The only thing eerie about Laserblast is <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people who made this loser are still running around loose." [...] In the review, Laserblast was described as [...] "an incomprehensible blending" [...] of popular recent films like Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, with a script [...] "so disordered we could not be certain that the reels were being run in proper sequence". It also criticized the props, particularly the laser gun, which they compared to a cereal box prize. A review by Variety magazine said the special effects were decent, but the script [...] "has more holes than the laser-ravaged landscape." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times said Kim Milford's performance was dull and that the script included plot-holes and inconsistencies. The Los Angeles Times critic Linda Gross said the script lacked [...] "credibility, psychological motivation and narrative cohesiveness", although she praised Terry Bowen's cinematography, saying it [...] "effectively captures the ambience of desert small-town life." [...] It was described {{as one of the}} worst films {{of the year in the}} book, The Golden Turkey Awards.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} {{economic}} effects {{to the person}} who has to shoulder the double burden. Oftentimes, this tends to be the woman in the relationship, and so there has been analysis done on the economic effect of the double burden on women. According to Himmelweit (2002), because women often earn less than men, there is <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> woman should be the one to fit her paid job around household activities such as taking care of children. Because of this, and because they have many domestic duties, women often take part-time jobs and jobs in the informal sector in order to balance paid work with domestic work. Part-time jobs and jobs in the informal sector do earn less than full-time jobs, so men have to increase their paid work hours in order to compensate for the lacking family income. This will [...] "weaken her earning power and strengthen his", leading to an unequal distribution of power in the household, and allow the man to exploit the woman's unpaid work. This situation could have negative consequences especially for the woman because she is perceived to have less contribution to the household, due to domestic work being seen as less of a contribution than paid work. Such negative consequences include the lack of a divorce threat, where the woman does not have the economic means to ask for a divorce because she does not have a full-time job, and she has less money that she personally receives, decreasing her perceived contributions to the household.|$|E

These decreases are largest when people are told to stop using safety behaviors and disconfirm <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> threatening situation will most likely not happen even if the safety behaviors are stopped. This combination of techniques is used in exposure and response prevention therapy for social anxiety.|$|R

Previously, leaders were concerned that taking over Palestine would divide it and leave it for other countries to take, but repeated losses to the Turkish Army and the stalled Western Front left many leaders including Lloyd George to believe that taking Palestine was the right decision. Although many wanted this change, Chief of the Imperial General Staff ("CIGS") Robertson believed that Western Front commitments did not justify a serious attempt to capture Jerusalem (Third Ypres was in progress from 31 July until November), and throughout 1917 he put pressure on Allenby to demand unrealistically large reinforcements to discourage the politicians from authorising Middle East offensives. Allenby's exact remit was still undecided when he was appointed.|$|E
2500|$|Legends connect Sarah's {{death with}} the {{attempted}} sacrifice of Isaac, however, {{there are two}} versions of the story. According to one, Samael came to her and said: [...] "Your old husband seized the boy and sacrificed him. The boy wailed and wept; but he could not escape from his father." [...] Sarah began to cry bitterly, and ultimately died of her grief. According to the other legend, Satan came to Sarah disguised as an old man, and told her that Isaac had been sacrificed. Believing it to be true, she cried bitterly, but soon comforted herself with <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sacrifice had been offered at the command of God. She started from Beer-sheba to Hebron, asking everyone she met if he knew in which direction Abraham had gone. Then Satan came again in human shape and told her that it was not true that Isaac had been sacrificed, but that he was living and would soon return with his father. Sarah, on hearing this, died of joy at Hebron. Abraham and Isaac returned to their home at Beer-sheba, and, not finding Sarah there, went to Hebron, where they discovered her dead. According to the Genesis Rabbah, during Sarah's lifetime her house was always hospitably open, the dough was miraculously increased, a light burned from Saturday evening to Saturday evening, and a pillar of cloud rested upon the entrance to her tent.|$|E
