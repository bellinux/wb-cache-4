Additionally, negative values of R2 may occur when fitting non-linear functions to data. In cases where negative values arise, <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data provides a better fit to the outcomes than do the fitted function values, according to this particular criterion.|$|E

Therefore, rogue waves are not necessarily the biggest waves found on the water; they are, rather, unusually large waves for a given sea state. Rogue waves seem not to have a single distinct cause, but occur where physical factors such as high winds and strong currents cause waves to merge to create a single exceptionally large wave.|$|E
25|$|In the 1890s (around 100 years later) two British physicists, William Ramsay and Lord Rayleigh, {{realized}} that their newly discovered inert gas, argon, {{was responsible for}} Cavendish's problematic residue; he had not made an error. What he had done was perform rigorous quantitative experiments, using standardized instruments and methods, aimed at reproducible results; taken <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> result of several experiments; and identified and allowed for sources of error. The balance that he used, made by a craftsman named Harrison, {{was the first of}} the precision balances of the 18th century, and as accurate as Lavoisier's (which has been estimated to measure one part in 400,000). Cavendish worked with his instrument makers, generally improving existing instruments rather than inventing wholly new ones.|$|E
25|$|First, a maximum-likelihood principle, {{based on}} the idea to {{increase}} the probability of successful candidate solutions and search steps. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution is updated such that the likelihood of previously successful candidate solutions is maximized. The covariance matrix of the distribution is updated (incrementally) such that the likelihood of previously successful search steps is increased. Both updates can be interpreted as a natural gradient descent. Also, in consequence, the CMA conducts an iterated principal components analysis of successful search steps while retaining all principal axes. Estimation of distribution algorithms and the Cross-Entropy Method are based on very similar ideas, but estimate (non-incrementally) the covariance matrix by maximizing the likelihood of successful solution points instead of successful search steps.|$|E

25|$|Megalencephaly (or macrencephaly, {{abbreviated}} MEG) is {{a growth}} development disorder {{in which the}} brain is abnormally large. It {{is characterized by a}} brain with an average weight that is 2.5 standard deviations above <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general population. Megalencephaly is usually diagnosed at birth and is confirmed with an MRI. A mutation in the PI3K-AKT pathway {{is believed to be the}} primary cause of brain proliferation and ultimately the root cause of megalencephaly. This mutation has produced a classification of brain overdevelopment that consists of two syndromes including, megalencephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) and megalencephaly-polydactyly-polymicrogyria-hydrocephalus (MPPH). Approximately 1 out of 50 children (2%) are said to have the characteristics of megalencephaly in the general population. There are several neuropsychiatric disorders linked with megalencephaly, however, studies have shown that autism is the most prevalent association with the malformation of MEG. Although no treatment currently exists for megalencephaly, management methods are focused at reducing deficits linked with autism. Most recent research is targeted at creating inhibitors to reduce the mutational pathway that causes megalencephaly.|$|E
