40|$|Abstract: The BlastSets {{strategy}} uses a {{probabilistic model}} to compare a query <b>set</b> to <b>target</b> <b>sets</b> of proteins. <b>Target</b> <b>sets</b> are neighborhoods that group proteins sharing some biological properties. <b>Target</b> <b>sets</b> are generated from a compact internal representation, BlastSets Classifications, {{constructed by the}} interpretation of results taken from the literature. We face a classic time-space trade off: instead of storing {{a very large number}} of sets, it is more intelligent to compute some <b>target</b> <b>sets</b> on the fly from a less explicit representation because only a small fraction of them may be pertinent to a given query set. We present an efficient method for the generation of <b>target</b> <b>sets</b> that are pertinent, in the sense they are likely to have good similarity scores with the query, and that form a qualitatively non-redundant collection of <b>target</b> <b>sets.</b> This method exploits the decomposition of a BlastSets Classification in three types: explicit classifications, where sets must be stored explicitly; hierarchical classifications, that defines an explicit classification; implicit classifications, for which we must provide an algorithm for sets generation. Mathematically, our method embeds each type of representation as partially ordered sets, in which pertinent <b>target</b> <b>sets</b> are minimal upper bounds...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{interest}} in nonfinancial performance measures has raised questions on how such measures influence employee reactions and behaviour. Surprisingly, {{the question of}} whether and how nonfinancial measures motivate employees to participate in <b>target</b> <b>setting</b> has remained largely unexplored. Employees can be motivated intrinsically or extrinsically to participate in <b>target</b> <b>setting.</b> Intrinsic motivation to participate in <b>target</b> <b>setting</b> initiates from within the employee and is perceived {{as an end in itself}} with the employee as the main beneficiary. In contrast, controlled extrinsic motivation to participate in <b>target</b> <b>setting</b> is controlled by the organization and is perceived as a means to an end with the organization as the main beneficiary. This study investigates the relative importance of nonfinancial measures vis-à-vis financial measures in engendering employee intrinsic and controlled extrinsic motivation to participate and how these two forms of motivation to participate in <b>target</b> <b>setting</b> translate into improved employee job performance. Based on a sample of 149 employees, the Partial Least Squares results indicate that both financial measures and nonfinancial measures are associated with employee intrinsic motivation to participate in <b>target</b> <b>setting.</b> However, only nonfinancial measures are associated with controlled extrinsic motivation to participate in <b>target</b> <b>setting</b> and because this form of motivation to participate is controlled by the organization as a means to achieve better performance, it is only this form of motivation which has a significant impact on employee job performance. These results provide important insights into the intricacies by which performance measures influence employee motivation to participate in <b>target</b> <b>setting</b> and job performance. 20 page(s...|$|R

The suspension is part of the decision of several Japanese manufacturers to suspend their joint development projects and contracts with several European partners. By early August 2012, PSA had sold a total of 6,575 Peugeot iOns and Citroën C-Zeros since their launch in Europe in 2010, while Mitsubishi had assembled almost 11,000 electric cars destined to PSA, leaving the French carmaker with more than 4,400 electric cars in unsold inventory.

With necessary connectivity for both fixed and switching communication topologies, multiple mechanical systems are shown to converge to the intersection of all the local <b>target</b> <b>sets</b> while the vectors of generalized coordinate derivatives are driven to zero.

The previously developed analytical target cascading process addresses the problem of translating supersystem design targets into design targets for all systems in a multilevel hierarchically structured product, so that local targets are consistent with each other and allow top targets to be met as closely as possible. In this article the process of rigorously <b>setting</b> the supersystem <b>targets</b> in an enterprise context is explored as a modelbased approach termed “analytical <b>target</b> <b>setting.</b> ” The effectiveness of linking analytical <b>target</b> <b>setting</b> and cascading is demonstrated in an automotive truck vehicle example...|$|R
