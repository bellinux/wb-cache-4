5|$|Hearings began September 27, 1918, {{shortly before}} the end of World War I. Nearly four dozen {{witnesses}} testified. Many were agents of the Bureau of Investigations (BOI), the predecessor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The agents, controversially and usually erroneously, implicated high-profile American citizens as pro-German, using <b>the</b> <b>fallacy</b> of guilt by association. For example, the Bureau chief labeled some people pro-German because they had insubstantial and non-ideological acquaintance with German agents. Others were accused because their names were discovered in the notebooks of suspected German agents, of whom they had never heard.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} <b>the</b> <b>fallacies</b> has changed almost beyond {{recognition}} since Charles Hamblin {{called for a}} radical reappraisal of this area of logical inquiry in his 1970 book <b>Fallacies.</b> <b>The</b> “witless examples of his forbears” to which Hamblin referred have largely been replaced by more authentic cases of <b>the</b> <b>fallacies</b> in actual use. It is now not unusual for fallacy and argumentation theorists to draw on actual sources for examples of how <b>the</b> <b>fallacies</b> are used in our everyday reasoning. However, an aspect of this move towards greater authenticity {{in the study of}} <b>the</b> <b>fallacies,</b> an aspect which has been almost universally neglected, is the attempt to subject <b>the</b> <b>fallacies</b> to empirical testing of the type which is more commonly associated with psychological experiments on reasoning. This paper addresses this omission in research on <b>the</b> <b>fallacies</b> by examining how subjects use two fallacies – circular argument and analogical argument – during a reasoning task in which subjects are required to consider a number of public health scenarios. Results are discussed in relation to a view of <b>the</b> <b>fallacies</b> as cognitive heuristics that facilitate reasoning in a context of uncertainty...|$|R

25|$|It is usual to {{say that}} Mill is {{committing}} a number of fallacies. He is accused of committing the naturalistic fallacy, because {{he is trying to}} deduce what people ought to do from what they in fact do; <b>the</b> <b>fallacy</b> of equivocation, because he moves from the fact that (1) something is desirable, i.e. is capable of being desired, to the claim that (2) it is desirable, i.e. that it ought to be desired; and <b>the</b> <b>fallacy</b> of composition, because the fact that people desire their own happiness does not imply that the aggregate of all persons will desire the general happiness.|$|E

25|$|The main {{interest}} of the questionnaire was {{to see if a}} participant answered yes to the first question, implying that they believed in the hot-hand fallacy.

Older adults are more likely to remember positive information, making them more sensitive to gains and less to losses than younger adults.|$|E

40|$|Insight {{into the}} {{strategic}} design of argumentative discourse can {{be gained by}} incorporating insight from rhetoric into a dialectical framework of analysis.

Van Eemeren and Houtlosser take this approach a step further by viewing argumentative moves as forms of "strategic manoeuvring" aimed at realizing {{at the same time}} a dialectical and a rhetorical aim. They analyse <b>the</b> <b>fallacies</b> as derailments of legitimate ways of strategic manoeuvring in which - without any notification - aiming for rhetorical effectiveness ("persuasiveness") has gained the upper hand over maintaining dialectical standerads ("critical reasonableness") ...|$|R

25|$|Most of {{the debate}} is mathematical, but some major {{elements}} can be explained in simple terms {{and as part of}} the 'aggregation problem'.

25|$|The {{paradox of}} thrift (or paradox of saving) is a paradox of economics. The paradox states that an {{increase}} in autonomous saving leads to a decrease in aggregate demand and thus a decrease in gross output which will in turn lower total saving. The paradox is, narrowly speaking, that total saving may fall because of individuals' attempts to increase their saving, and, broadly speaking, that increase in saving may be harmful to an economy. Both the narrow and broad claims are paradoxical within the assumption underlying <b>the</b> <b>fallacy</b> of composition, namely that what {{is true of the}} parts must be true of the whole. The narrow claim transparently contradicts this assumption, and the broad one does so by implication, because while individual thrift is generally averred to be good for the economy, the paradox of thrift holds that collective thrift may be bad for the economy.|$|E
