2500|$|The tooling {{used for}} thread milling can be solid or indexable. For {{internal}} threads, solid cutters are generally limited to holes larger than , and indexable internal <b>thread</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> {{are limited to}} holes larger than [...] The advantage {{is that when the}} insert wears out it is easily and more cost effectively replaced. The disadvantage is the cycle time is generally longer than solid tools. Note that solid multiple-form <b>thread</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> look similar to taps, but they differ in that the <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> does not have a backtaper and there is not a lead-in chamfer. This lack of a lead-in chamfer allows the threads to be formed within one pitch length of the bottom of a blind hole.|$|R
25|$|The {{greatest}} disadvantage is {{the difficulty}} in machining such a <b>thread.</b> The single-point <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> or taps and dies used to cut the thread cannot have efficient rake and relief angles (because of the square form), which makes the cutting slow and difficult. Square threads also cannot carry as much load as a trapezoidal thread, because {{the root of the}} square thread is smaller. Also, {{there is no way to}} compensate for wear on the nut, so it must be replaced when worn out.|$|R

2500|$|Single-point threading, also colloquially called single-pointing (or just <b>thread</b> <b>cutting</b> {{when the}} context is implicit), is an {{operation}} that uses a single-point tool to produce a thread form on a cylinder or cone. The tool moves [...] while the precise rotation of the workpiece determines {{the lead of the}} thread. The process can be done to create external or internal threads (male or female). In external <b>thread</b> <b>cutting,</b> the piece can either be held in a chuck or mounted between two centers. With internal <b>thread</b> <b>cutting,</b> the piece is held in a chuck. The tool moves across the piece linearly, taking chips off the workpiece with each pass. Usually 5 to 7 light cuts create the correct depth of the thread.|$|R
