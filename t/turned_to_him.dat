5|$|By 07:30, Davout {{had gained}} control of the three flèches. Prince Bagration quickly led a counterattack that threw the French out of the positions, only to have Marshal Michel Ney lead a charge by the 24thRegiment that retook them. Although not enamoured of Barclay, Bagration <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for aid, {{ignoring}} Kutuzov altogether; Barclay, to his credit, responded quickly, sending three guard regiments, eight grenadier battalions, and twenty-four 12-pounder cannon at their best pace to bolster Semyаnovskaya. Colonel Toll and Kutuzov moved the Guard Reserve units forward as early as 09:00 hours.|$|E
5|$|In 1530, Mingyi Nyo's son 14-year-old Tabinshwehti succeeded him as king. Toungoo's {{stability}} {{continued to}} attract manpower {{from the surrounding}} regions, especially after 1533 when the Confederation sacked its erstwhile ally Prome. The tiny Toungoo was now the only ethnic Burman-led kingdom, and one surrounded by much larger kingdoms. Fortunately for Toungoo, the Confederation was distracted by internal leadership disputes, and Hanthawaddy, then the most powerful kingdom of all post-Pagan kingdoms, was weakly led. Tabinshwehti decided not {{to wait until the}} larger kingdoms' attention <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Catch Me If You Can is a 2002 American biographical crime film {{directed}} and co-produced by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Jeff Nathanson. The film {{is based on}} the life of Frank Abagnale, who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a Pan American World Airways pilot, a Georgia doctor and a Louisiana parish prosecutor. His primary crime was check fraud; he became so experienced that the FBI eventually <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for help in catching other checking forgers. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, with Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, and Nathalie Baye in supporting roles.|$|E

5|$|After an aborted {{attempt by}} Kennedy to bring yet another studio that had <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for help, First National Pictures, into the Photophone fold, RCA {{was ready to}} step back in: the company {{acquired}} Kennedy's stock in both FBO and the KAO theater business. On October 23, 1928, RCA announced {{the creation of the}} Radio-Keith-Orpheum holding company, with Sarnoff as chairman of the board. Kennedy, who withdrew from his executive positions in the merged companies, kept Pathé separate from RKO and under his personal control. RCA owned the governing stock interest in RKO, 22 percent; in the early 1930s, RCA's share of stock in the company rose as high as 60 percent. The company's production and distribution arm, presided over by former FBO vice-president Joseph I. Schnitzer, was incorporated early in 1929 as Radio Pictures. Looking {{to get out of the}} film business the following year, Kennedy arranged in late 1930 for RKO to purchase Pathé from him.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1910s, Gershwin met {{songwriter}} and music director William Daly. The two collaborated on the Broadway musicals Piccadilly to Broadway (1920) and For Goodness' Sake (1922), and jointly composed the score for Our Nell (1923). This {{was the beginning}} of a long friendship; Daly was a frequent arranger, orchestrator and conductor of Gershwin's music, and Gershwin periodically <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for musical advice.|$|E

25|$|Burton {{was born}} in Edinburgh to John Hill Burton, a lawyer and amateur historian, who had written two books on economics, which had {{received}} attention in Japan. His mother was Katherine, daughter of Dr Cosmo Innes, one of Scotland's foremost amateur photographers. He was also a childhood friend of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for background information for The Engineer's Thumb; Doyle's book, The Firm of Girdlestone, is dedicated to Burton.|$|E

After he becomes the conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, he attempts to make Reiji join him. When Reiji is revealed to be his son, he refuses to acknowledge it because he does not want a child.|$|E

25|$|Rhodri Meilir (2005–09) portrays Alfie Butts. Alfie is {{a friend}} of Nick's who turned up at the Harper {{household}} at Christmas 2005. Alfie comes from a small community in Wales which, based on his stories, has some rather backwards traditions. Also, there weren't many girls where he came from, so he savors spending time at the Harpers' and meeting Michael's friends. Most of the family have <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> at various times for advice. He's a struggling musician who is very laid-back about life despite not having a home or a steady income. He did not appear in the 2009 Christmas special and was completely absent from the whole of series 10 and 11, with no explanation.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{was honored}} {{with a state}} funeral in which Texas Congressman J. J. Pickle and former Secretary of State Dean Rusk eulogized him at the Capitol. The final {{services}} took place on January 25. The funeral {{was held at the}} National City Christian Church in Washington, D.C., where he had often worshiped as president. The service was presided over by President Richard Nixon and attended by foreign dignitaries, led by former Japanese prime minister Eisaku Satō, who served as Japanese prime minister during Johnson's presidency. Eulogies were given by the Rev. Dr. George Davis, the church's pastor, and W. Marvin Watson, former postmaster general. Nixon did not speak, though he attended, as is customary for presidents during state funerals, but the eulogists <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and lauded him for his tributes, as Rusk did the day before, as Nixon mentioned Johnson's death in a speech he gave the day after Johnson died, announcing the peace agreement to end the Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|The {{tensions}} between the Habsburgs and the Kingdom of Hungary remained largely unresolved during Kollár's lifetime and his stance brought him the wrath of his fellow noblemen in the province, {{but he did not}} relent. He lived in Vienna, the capital of all of the Habsburg Monarchy, where his views were not merely au courrant among its denizens, but actually radiated from the center of power. The publication of Kollár's De Originibus et Usu perpetuo... (1764) was in line and perhaps coordinated with the Habsburgs' goals and he more than retained his status of Maria Theresa's favorite and influential academic partisan. He wrote in favor of the Habsburgs' Enlightened policies, opposed serfdom and advocated religious freedom in the whole monarchy. Maria Theresa <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> with requests for a large number of position papers relevant to her policy. His arguments in Jurium Hungariæ in Russiam Minorem... published in Latin and German in 1772 were called on by the Habsburgs to support their subsequent annexations of Galicia and Dalmatia.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{publication}} of his Webster, scholars <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for editorial advice: he helped in the preparation of Hayward's Nonesuch Donne (1929), Housman's More Poems (1936), and Theodore Redpath's Songs and Sonets of John Donne (1956). He also performed an editorial and advisory role for Christopher Sandford at the Golden Cockerel Press, where he introduced Victor Scholderer's New Hellenic typeface (1937). A number of his verse translations from Greek and Latin, with engravings by John Buckland Wright, were published in collectors' editions by the Golden Cockerel Press and Folio Society. In the middle years of his career he was in demand as an invitation lecturer, giving seven BBC wireless talks in 1930, on Dorothy Osborne and on the Victorian Poets, delivering the 1933 Warton Lecture on English Poetry to the British Academy, lecturing at the Royal Institution on Classicism and Romanticism (1935) and at the Royal Society of Literature on travel writing (1937), and, as part of a British Council drive to counter Soviet propaganda, lecturing in German on European literature to packed halls at the British Information Centre in West Berlin in October 1948 during the Berlin Blockade.|$|E

500|$|Ealhmund was {{probably}} the father of Egbert of Wessex, {{and it is possible}} that Offa's interventions in Kent in the mid-780s are connected to the subsequent exile of Egbert to Francia. The Chronicle claims that when Egbert invaded Kent in 825, the men of the southeast <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> [...] "because earlier they were wrongly forced away from his relatives". This is likely to be an allusion to Ealhmund, and may imply that Ealhmund had a local overlordship of the southeastern kingdoms. If so, Offa's intervention {{was probably}} intended to gain control of this relationship and take over the dominance of the associated kingdoms.|$|E

Because Glik was concerned that the officers were using excessive force, he filmed the encounter with his cell phone. Although Glik was 10 feet away and was not interfering with the arrest, {{one of the officers}} <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> after placing handcuffs on the suspect and said [...] "I think you have taken enough pictures". Glik replied that he was recording the incident; he said, [...] "I am recording this. I saw you punch him".

500|$|Family friend John T. Ford opened 1,500-seat Ford's Theatre on November 9 in Washington, D.C. Booth {{was one of}} {{the first}} leading men to appear there, playing in Charles Selby's The Marble Heart. In this play, Booth portrayed a Greek {{sculptor}} in costume, making marble statues come to life. Lincoln watched the play from his box. At one point during the performance, Booth was said to have shaken his finger in Lincoln's direction as he delivered a line of dialogue. Lincoln's sister-in-law was sitting with him in the same presidential box where he was later slain; she <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and said, [...] "Mr. Lincoln, he looks as if he meant that for you." [...] The President replied, [...] "He does look pretty sharp at me, doesn't he?" [...] On another occasion, Lincoln's son Tad saw Booth perform. He said that the actor thrilled him, prompting Booth to give Tad a rose. Booth ignored an invitation to visit Lincoln between acts.|$|E
500|$|From ca. 814/5, Abu Ishaq began forming his {{corps of}} Turkish troops. The first {{members of the}} corps were {{domestic}} slaves he bought in Baghdad (the distinguished general Itakh was originally a cook) whom he trained {{in the art of}} war, but they were soon complemented by Turkish slaves sent directly from Central Asia after an agreement with the local Samanid rulers. This private force was small—it probably numbered between three and four thousand {{at the time of his}} accession—but it was highly trained and disciplined, and made Abu Ishaq a man of power in his own right, as al-Ma'mun increasingly <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for assistance. Abu Ishaq's Turkish corps was also politically useful to al-Ma'mun, who tried to lessen his own dependence on [...] the mostly eastern Iranian leaders who had supported him in the civil war, and who now occupied the senior positions in the new regime. In an effort to counterbalance their influence, al-Ma'mun granted formal recognition to his brother and his Turkish corps, as well as placing the Arab tribal levies of the Mashriq in the hands of his own son, al-Abbas.|$|E
