Sixteen small-seeded lines and cultivars were grown in replicated tests at three Iowa locations during two years. The natto quality traits evaluated for each plot were water absorption, water loss after steaming, hardness of steamed seed and natto, and darkness of steamed seeds and natto. The seed traits evaluated were <b>total</b> <b>sugar,</b> free sugar, sucrose, raffinose, stachyose, protein, oil, fiber, protein + oil, protein + oil + fiber, and seed size. To efficiently evaluate <b>total</b> <b>sugar</b> content in this study, a rapid method for <b>total</b> <b>sugar</b> determination by acid hydrolysis was developed. Significant differences among genotypes were observed for all traits, except fiber content. There were significant differences between years or among locations for all traits, except water loss and stachyose. All seed traits, except stachyose, oil, and seed size had significant associations with natto quality traits. Protein + oil content was significantly correlated with natto quality traits and would be considered a useful selection criterion in a breeding program.

This study aimed at developing an HPTLC protocol for the rapid quantitative determination of maltose and <b>total</b> <b>sugars</b> in four commercial varieties and to {{compare them to}} 243 hybrids grouped by flesh colour (white, orange, purple). In commercial varieties, mean maltose content varied from 10. 26 to 15. 60 % and <b>total</b> <b>sugars</b> from 17. 83 to 27. 77 % on fresh weight basis. Hybrids showed significant variation in maltose content within each group, with means ranging from 7. 65 % for white-fleshed, to 8. 53 % in orange- and 11. 98 % in purple-fleshed. Total mean sugars content was 20. 24, 22. 11 and 26. 84 % respectively for white, orange and purple flesh hybrids. No significant correlations were detected between individual sugars but maltose and <b>total</b> <b>sugars</b> content were highly correlated. Compared to the best commercial variety (Baby), 25 hybrids (10. 3 %) presented a higher maltose content and 40 (16. 5 %) showed a higher <b>total</b> <b>sugars</b> content.

Objective: The aim of this review {{was to examine the}} cross-sectional or prospective evidence for associations between the intake of <b>total</b> <b>sugar</b> or added sugar (high vs low intakes) and diet quality or nutrient intakes in the general population. Data Sources: The following databases were searched for English-language articles published between 1972 and 2012 : CINAHL Plus, EBM Reviews, ERIC, MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. Study Selection: The search identified studies that examined the association between intake of <b>total</b> <b>sugar</b> and/or added sugar and diet quality (n[*]=[*] 22) or nutrient intakes (n[*]=[*] 30). Data Extraction: The following data were extracted: sample size and population, dietary assessment method, source of added sugar data, source of funding, comparator, association between <b>total</b> <b>sugar</b> or added sugar and diet quality, and the direction and magnitude of the association. Data Synthesis: Of 22 studies, all except 1 found a higher intake of added sugar to be associated with poorer diet quality, and the exceptional study did not adjust for total energy intake. Twenty-one of 30 studies found a negative association between added sugar and micronutrient intakes. The same association was not found for <b>total</b> <b>sugar</b> intake. Conclusion: Any negative association between dietary sugar and diet quality is better exposed by referring to added <b>sugar</b> rather than <b>total</b> <b>sugar.</b> There was substantial variation in features of study quality, including sample size, so the magnitude of the observed effect was generally small and may not be of clinical significance.

Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate relative risks and 95 % confidence intervals. There were no statistically significant associations with endometrial cancer risk for increasing quartile intakes {{of any of the}} exposure variables. However, in continuous models calibrated by using 24 -hour recall values, the multivariable relative risks were 1. 61 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 06, 2. 45) per 100 g/day of total carbohydrates, 1. 40 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 99, 1. 99) per 50 units/day of total dietary glycemic load, and 1. 36 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 05, 1. 76) per 50 g/day of <b>total</b> <b>sugars.</b> These associations were stronger among women who had never used postmenopausal hormone therapy compared with ever users (total carbohydrates p(heterogeneity) = 0. 04). Data suggest no association of overall glycemic index, total starch, and total fiber with risk, and a possible modest positive association of total carbohydrates, total dietary glycemic load, and <b>total</b> <b>sugars</b> with risk, particularly among never users of hormone replacement therapy...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{alkaline}} sulfite pretreatment of corn stover was optimized. The {{influences of}} pretreatments on solid yield, delignification, and carbohydrate recovery under different pretreatment conditions and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis were investigated. The effect of pretreatment was evaluated by enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency and the <b>total</b> <b>sugar</b> yield. The optimum pretreatment conditions were obtained, as follows: the total titratable alkali (TTA) of 12 %, liquid/solid ratio of 6 : 1, temperature of 140 degrees C, and holding time of 20 min. Under those conditions, the solid yield was 55. 24 %, and {{the removal of}} lignin was 82. 68 %. Enzymatic hydrolysis rates of glucan and xylan for pretreated corn stover were 85. 38 % and 70. 36 %, and the <b>total</b> <b>sugar</b> yield was 74. 73 % at cellulase loading of 20 FPU/g and beta-glucosidase loading of 10 IU/g for 48 h. Compared with sodium hydroxide pretreatment with the same amount of total titratable alkali, the <b>total</b> <b>sugar</b> yield was raised by about 10. 43 %. Additionally, the corn stover pretreated under the optimum pretreatment conditions was beaten by PFI at 1500 revolutions. After beating, enzymatic hydrolysis rates of glucan and xylan were 89. 74 % and 74. 06 %, and the <b>total</b> <b>sugar</b> yield was 78. 58 % at the same enzymatic hydrolysis conditions. Compared with 1500 rpm of PFI beating after sodium pretreatment with the same amount of total titratable alkali, the <b>total</b> <b>sugar</b> yield was raised by about 14. 05 %...|$|R
30|$|Sugars (sucrose, glucose, {{fructose}} and maltose), ethanol and glycerol {{concentrations were}} determined using a HPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) {{equipped with a}} Shodex SUGAR KS- 801 column, or a Phenomenex Rezex RPM-Monosaccharide column, and a refractive index detector (RID- 10 A). The <b>total</b> <b>sugar</b> content in mashes was expressed in glucose equivalents (glucose[*]+[*]fructose[*]+[*] 1.05 × sucrose[*]+[*] 1.05 × maltose). The <b>total</b> <b>sugar</b> in raw matter was expressed in glucose equivalent as the sum: 1.11 × starch[*]+[*]glucose[*]+[*]fructose[*]+[*] 1.05 × sucrose.|$|R
30|$|Treatment of H 2 O 2 {{caused the}} {{increases}} in growth, water content, mineral concentration, proline, <b>total</b> <b>sugar</b> and soluble protein contents compared to the control groups in the leaves of both cultivars. Yet excess copper caused reductions in the growth, leaf water potential, Na+, K+, Ca+, Mg 2 + concentrations and soluble protein levels but increases in proline, <b>total</b> soluble <b>sugars</b> and Cu 2 + contents compared to the control group. Dry matter, leaf water potential and mineral content of Cu[*]+[*]H 2 O 2 group revealed a lower decrease than Cu group ones. A higher increase was also observed in proline and <b>total</b> <b>sugar</b> contents of Cu[*]+[*]H 2 O 2 group than Cu group ones in both cultivars.|$|R
