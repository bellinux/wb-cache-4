50|$|Cravens, after {{interviewing}} leading researchers, engineers, {{and experts}} {{in the fields of}} nuclear fission and radiation, public health, counterterrorism, and risk assessment, concludes that nuclear power is clean and safe. Exploration of the issues from multiple points of view and her own observations reveal to her that nuclear fission as a power source is being economically and cleanly harnessed in the U.S. She finds that in countries like France and Sweden, which both derive considerable energy from nuclear plants, the environment is far safer and cleaner than in those nations that continue to get most of their electricityfrom burning fossil fuels. She learns that in the worldwide energy industry - including wind and solar - nuclear power has by far the fewest deaths per <b>terawatt-hour</b> generated. She concludes that if we are to care for subsequent generations, embracing nuclear energy is an ethical imperative.|$|E
