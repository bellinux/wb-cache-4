His roommate was not at home, so he took the bodies into his apartment, where he took pornographic photographs of, and had sex with, the naked corpses before dismembering them. He then put the body parts into plastic bags, which he later abandoned near Loma Prieta Mountain. Before disposing of Pesce's and Luchessa's severed heads in a ravine, Kemper engaged in irrumatio with both of them. In August, Pesce's skull was found up on Loma Prieta Mountain. An extensive search failed to <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> rest of her remains or a trace of her companion.|$|E
5|$|The {{video is}} set at night and opens with Brown, {{dressed in a black}} suit, {{drinking}} alcohol in the streets, before hailing a futuristic hover-cab. Brown asks the cab driver {{to take him to the}} best spot in town. He then asks the driver to <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> air conditioner because he's hot, but the driver turns up the music instead, while wearing a horse mask on his head. As the song begins, Brown exits the cab and arrives at a street party filled with people wearing animal heads. He then enters a club, where he performs the first dance sequence in the video with his male backup dancers. During the first chorus, Brown arrives inside the main room of the club filled with flashing lights and people dancing while wearing animal heads. After a hat gets tossed to him by one of his dancers in the crowd, Brown and his backup dancers perform another dance sequence as the queen of the party watches them from her perch. These party scenes are intercut with scenes of Brown dancing alone in another room surrounded by flashing lights and speakers in the background.|$|E

On 10 February, as Blücher accompanied the column of Kaptzevich and Kleist while it marched toward Sézanne, the sound of artillery began to rumble ominously to the right near Champaubert.|$|E

25|$|Though {{both sides}} {{were aware of the}} {{presence}} of enemy forces in the vicinity of Guadalcanal by 24 August, neither knew the disposition or strength of their opponent. The Americans, who had by now tracked down Ryūjō, were still actively searching for Shōkaku and Zuikaku. Vice Admiral Fletcher was hesitant to send out squadrons for attacks on a lone light carrier without definitive news concerning larger Japanese fleet movements. The Japanese as a result launched planes from Ryūjō without harassment, sending the strike force out against Henderson Field while they waited for scouts to <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> American fleet. At about the time this contingent began attacks on the airfield, Japanese scouts finally spotted U.S. carriers, leading to immediate launches from Shōkaku and Zuikaku. Though American scout planes eventually sighted the larger Japanese carriers, their reports didn't make it back to command and groping attack groups never uncovered their target.|$|E
25|$|The global American and European weather models {{encountered}} exceptional {{difficulty in}} portraying {{the path of}} the storm. The main issue that the models were trying to resolve was whether or not the upper-level low pressure system from Central Canada was going to phase in time with the southern stream energy, thereby revealing if the resulting storm would come up the Eastern Seaboard or simply continue to move east out to sea in the Atlantic Ocean. The latter solution would have only caused the storm to affect the Mid-Atlantic states of Virginia and North Carolina with a modest winter storm instead of the entire Eastern coastline up to Atlantic Canada. As such, it was only 24 hours prior to the storm's arrival in the Northeastern states when all the European and American models were in agreement that the storm would <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> entire coastline. The National Weather Service's Hydrometeorological Prediction Center and many other private forecasters were skeptical of the storm impacting the Northeastern states until about 24 hours of the storm's arrival as well; although, some models depicted the storm delivering a full-blown blizzard to the New York City metropolitan area as early as a week in advance. The Hydrometeorological Prediction Center even issued a statement on Christmas Eve, 48 hours prior to the storm, that they suspected the American models of having model initialization errors; thus, they believed these errors may have forced the storm to be erroneously modeled to come up the Northeastern coast.|$|E
25|$|For the Wednesday {{night game}} at the Big 10's Ohio State, the Cougars looked to have finally found their scoring touch, even if the defense started out on shaky, wet ground. OSU's first shot was a rocket off a {{crossing}} pass that was too fast for Dal Santo to reach, giving the Buckeyes the 1–0 lead in the 8th minute. Ten minutes later, Ebbesen headed a midfield pass to former Buckeye Solawa, who fired it through to Jambga, who was racing toward the goal and fired a 16-foot shot {{into the back of}} the net, upping the score to 1–1. On a 27th minute corner kick, an OSU header, only their second shot on goal, eluded Dal Santo to put the home team back in the lead 2–1. As the clock wound down on the first half, the Cougars earned a corner kick of their own; on a classic Kendall-Moullin high-pass-to-a-leaping-crowd, Gabe Christianson headed the ball into the net with 7 seconds remaining, for a 2–2 score on his first goal since November 2, 2013 after missing two seasons with injuries. The Buckeyes tried to <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> heat in the second half, but the Cougar defense returned to its stalwart form, with Dal Santo making three strong saves.As the end of regulation time neared, McHugh sent a back-heel pass to Jambga, who shot hard and low toward the far post from fifteen yards out with one minute left on the clock for what would be the game winner.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Madonna pleads the {{listener}} {{to stop for}} a moment, {{to get away from}} the world through music, with the lines going as: [...] "I don't know how I got to this stage / Let me out of my cage cause I'm dying / <b>Turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> radio, <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> radio / Don't ask me where I wanna go, we gotta <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> radio." [...] During the intermediate verses, Madonna sings about making speakers blow, which is accompanied by a subtle sound of an actual speaker blowing up. It also talks about the need to relax as well as the need to have fun. According to NMEs Priya Elan, [...] "the song continues [...] career-spanning themes of getting into the groove, of uniting the bourgeoisie and rebelling."

500|$|... "Turn Up the Music" [...] is an uptempo {{electronic}} dance, {{and house}} song, which {{last for a}} duration of three minutes and forty-nine seconds. Instrumentation is provided by pulsating beats, synthesizers and percussion. Rap-Up described the production as [...] "synth-heavy". The song opens with Brown singing [...] "Turn up the music cause the sun just came up / <b>Turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> music {{if they try to}} turn us down / <b>Turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> music cause I'm trying to hear the speakers blow / <b>Turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> music, fill your cup and drink it down". It is then followed by repeated chants of [...] "If you're sexy and you know it put your hands up in the air". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard noted that the chanting was a reference to LMFAO's [...] "Sexy and I Know It" [...] (2011). Andy Kellman of Allmusic likened the song to Baltimora's [...] "Tarzan Boy" [...] (1985).|$|E

500|$|When {{longitudinal}} {{muscles in}} the ampullae contract, valves in the lateral canals close and water is forced into the tube feet. These extend to contact the substrate. Although the tube feet resemble suction cups in appearance, the gripping action {{is a function of}} adhesive chemicals rather than suction. [...] Other chemicals and relaxation of the ampullae allow for release from the substrate. The tube feet latch on to surfaces and move in a wave, with one arm section attaching to the surface as another releases. Some starfish <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> tips of their arms while moving which gives maximum exposure of the sensory tube feet and the eyespot to external stimuli.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the scenes}} set at Gretchen Starns' house were filmed in a [...] "turn-of-the-century" [...] home in North Vancouver, British Columbia. Initially, the {{producers}} wanted to set the sequence at a tract home, and emulate the [...] "pastel community" [...] featured in movies like Edward Scissorhands (1990) and The Truman Show (1998). However, when a tract home with the necessary attributes did not <b>turn</b> <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> crew decided to shoot the scene in a [...] "spookier" [...] location. Special effect rigging was then installed on the house to allow the bug creature to scale the wall. The elaborate sequence in which the insect creature crawls across a ceiling was made by creating an upside-down mock house set. The actress portraying the creature then crawled on the set and the footage was flipped in post-production. The scenes featuring an armored car smashing through the wall of VinylRight were filmed on a specially constructed soundstage.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} by American record producer Jude Cole, Lifehouse, and John Fields. Lifehouse started recording Who We Are without any demos, and only had lyrics from Jason Wade when they entered the studio. When asked about creating a song for the album, Lifehouse lead percussionist Rick Woolstenhulme, Jr. said, [...] "Nobody really knew what they would be playing. We just cut it, listened to it and realized it was pretty electric… the kind of song where you just <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> radio." [...] The album focused on the different emotions of love, bliss, struggles, and pain. Musically, the album {{was a combination of}} rock, alternative, and adult alternative. After being asked about the title of the album, Wade stated, [...] "We established camaraderie on the road and gelled as a unit. This record defines 'Who We Are,' which is why that’s the title. The sound fits where we’re at right now." ...|$|E

The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the morale is high to get a little bit more out of your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that." ...|$|E
