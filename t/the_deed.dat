5|$|In 1707 a deed {{was found}} among the ancient files of York County, Maine, near where Wheelwright had brought his flock to settle in Wells. <b>The</b> <b>deed,</b> dated 17 May 1629, showed Wheelwright as being one of several {{recipients}} of land from the Indian sagamores of southern New Hampshire, and a signer of the document. <b>The</b> <b>deed</b> thus implied that Wheelwright was present in New England in 1629, {{even though he was}} known to be the vicar of Bilsby in Lincolnshire at the time. While many historians declared <b>the</b> <b>deed</b> to be a forgery, Charles H. Bell, in his biography of Wheelwright in 1876, presented the case that <b>the</b> <b>deed</b> could be legitimate. It was known that as the vicar of Bilsby, Wheelwright was required to send a transcript of the parish registers to a central repository once a year, and this was done in March. However, of the several transcripts found with Wheelwright's signature attached, the one for March 1629 could not be found, leaving the door wide open to the possibility that Wheelwright had come to New England during this time frame and then returned to England. Sometime after Bell published his book on Wheelwright, the missing transcript was found, proving almost conclusively that Wheelwright had never left England during his ministry at Bilsby, and demonstrating with certainty that <b>the</b> <b>deed</b> of 1629 was a forgery. Sometime before his death, Governor Bell acknowledged the sequence of events and that <b>the</b> <b>deed</b> was an ingenious fabrication, and stated this in an undated letter to the New England Historical and Genealogical Society.|$|E
