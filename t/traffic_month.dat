Also the <b>traffic</b> <b>month</b> distribution and the peak hour transit for national and international passengers for arrivals and departures have been determined.

One way to increase traffic, especially during economic down periods or historic slow traffic times, is to hold an event to draw traffic and increase sales. This paper describes {{a case study of}} how a marketing event helped improve traffic for a furniture chain store during the well-known slow <b>traffic</b> <b>months</b> of May and September. It covers how the idea for the event came into being, including the open-culture of the organization that allowed bottom-up innovation, the various facets of holding a successful event, and the results of the event. In comparison, the paper also describes a much less successful event and the most plausible reasons for its lack of success. The original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|R
