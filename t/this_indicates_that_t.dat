40|$|Using {{empirical}} ion velocity distributions {{derived from}} UVCS and SUMER ultraviolet spectroscopy, we construct theoretical {{models of the}} nonequilibrium plasma state of the polar solar corona. The primary energy deposition mechanism we investigate is the dissipation of high frequency (10 [...] 10000 Hz) ioncyclotron resonant Alfv'en waves which can heat and accelerate ions differently depending on their charge and mass.

There is evidence for steepening of the Alfv'en wave spectrum between the coronal base and the largest heights observed spectroscopically, and it is important to take Coulomb collisions into account to understand observations at the lowest heights.

40|$|Mitochondrial protein import is {{essential}} for all eukaryotes. Here we show that the early diverging eukaryote Trypanosoma brucei has a non-canonical inner membrane (IM) protein translocation machinery. Besides TbTim 17, the single member of the Tim 17 / 22 / 23 family in trypanosomes, the presequence translocase contains nine subunits that co-purify in reciprocal immunoprecipitations and with a presequence-containing substrate that is trapped in the translocation channel. Two of the newly discovered subunits are rhomboid-like proteins, which are essential for growth and mitochondrial protein import. Rhomboid-like proteins were proposed to form the protein translocation pore of the ER-associated degradation system, suggesting that they may contribute to pore formation in the presequence translocase of T. brucei. Pulldown of import-arrested mitochondrial carrier protein shows that the carrier translocase shares eight subunits with the presequence translocase. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>T.</b> brucei may have a single IM translocase that with compositional variations mediates import of presequence-containing and carrier proteins...|$|E

METHODS: Paired peripheral blood and synovial samples from 10 patients with ReA were studied by dual color flow cytometry using T cell receptor (TCR) V beta specific and CD 4 or CD 8 specific antibodies. Two synovial CD 8 expansions were studied by 3 color flow cytometry. Peripheral blood samples from 13 healthy, age matched individuals were studied as controls. RESULTS: Statistically significant expansions were observed in all patients, occurring in blood and SF CD 4 and CD 8 compartments, but were most common in the synovial CD 8 compartment. Expansions studied in further detail displayed an activated "memory" phenotype. A synovial BV 22 S 1 /CD 8 expansion was seen in 5 / 6 patients with sexually acquired ReA.

Further work revealed that the HER 3 subunit of an EGFR:HER 3 heterodimer suppresses EGFR ligand binding. Optimization required reversing this suppression by mutation of the EGFR tether domain (G 564 A; subdomain IV).

Since an unpalatable feed will result in the poor quality of the organism, evaluating the palatability of sea urchin artificial feeds is important. In South Africa, the sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla has been selected for aquaculture due to its fast growth and high quality roe. Although it is a generalist herbivore, various studies have shown that T. gratilla has a significant preference for the macroalgae Ulva.

Chemosensory trials involving Ulva and its chemical constituents, as well as wounded Ulva and an artificial feed, were carried out using a Y-shaped maze. Results indicate that T. gratilla are not deterred by DMS or acrylic acid as literature suggests. Since previous studies showed that these two chemicals deter urchins, this study demonstrates that there are species-specific relationships to chemicals found in algal material. Results also indicate that T. gratilla are deterred by wounded Ulva, ulvan and ethanol, but cannot differentiate between these constituents when the constituents are compared against each other or ethanolic extract, fresh Ulva and feed.

Because the former may be mediated in part by lymphokines secreted by T cells, we have focussed our interest on the in vivo and in vitro cytokine secretion patterns of T lymphocytes from psoriatic lesions. In five patients T lymphocytes were obtained from epidermal specimens. The cells were propagated with lectin and irradiated feeder cells and subsequently cloned by limiting dilution. The resulting T-cell clones were phenotypically and functionally characterized.

All cells tested produced interferon-Î³ whereas only a minority secreted interleukin (IL) - 4. Moreover, these cells produced high amounts of IL- 2 but only little or no IL- 10 or tumor necrosis factor-Î±. To correlate these data with the in vivo situation, biopsies from psoriatic lesions of live patients were investigated for the presence of the mRNA of IL- 4, IL- 10, and interferon-Î³ using the polymerase chain reaction. In these biopsies only the mRNA for the Th 1 cytokine interferon-Î³ but not for the Th 2 cytokines IL- 4 and IL- 10 could be detected.

40|$|The CD 4 antigen is {{expressed}} on T cells of all mammalian species examined {{and appears to}} play an important role in the response of T cells to antigen. In humans, the molecule acts as a receptor for the AIDS virus. Previous studies have demonstrated that M phi in the rat and human also express the CD 4 antigen, which is indistinguishable from <b>that</b> on <b>T</b> cells. In this paper we demonstrate by FACS analysis, Northern blot hybridization, and immunoperoxidase labeling that, in striking contrast to the rat and human, mouse M phi do not express the CD 4 (L 3 T 4) antigen. <b>This</b> species heterogeneity <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>T</b> cells and M phi regulate CD 4 antigen expression independently and that CD 4 may not be essential for M phi function...|$|R
40|$|Individuals with Down {{syndrome}} (US) {{suffer from}} increased incidence of respiratory infections and lymphoblastic leukemia, and a death rate {{that is particularly}} high in the first 5 years of life. Relatively few studies have probed immune parameters in young US children. Primary immune defects in DS may be masked by a degree of immune maturity in adults, and hygienic factors may {{have an effect on}} immune capability throughout the years. A study of young children can give clearer evidence of the actual primary immune defects in DS. Blood samples were drawn from 20 DS children under 6 years old and from age-matched controls. Packed blood cell volume was measured, various blood cell subpopulations were enumerated and differential counts were performed. Several tests of cellular immune function were performed and plasma zinc levels were determined using atomic adsorption spectrophotometry. Elevated hematocrit levels were observed in the US group. White blood cell counts and proportions of rosette-forming cells were normal in blood from DS children. Altered neutrophil and lymphocyte proportions in DS samples resulted from a depressed number of circulating lymphocytes in the these subjects. <b>This</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>T</b> cell numbers are low in DS. DS individuals had a low number of circulating OKT 4 + T cells which resulted in significantly depressed T 4 :T 8 ratios. Cells from DS subjects exhibited a reduced proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin; a low response to the optimal concentration of concanavalin A was seen with DS samples, but at suboptimal doses the response was normal; suboptimal concentrations of pokeweed mitogen elicited normal responses by cells from DS children. Preliminary results suggest that interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) production in young children may correlate positively with age and that DS subjects may produce normal or elevated amounts of IL- 2. This suggests that IL- 2 receptor function may be defective in T cells from DS children. DS children had normal natural killer cell activity and cells from those children were no more sensitive to the augmenting effects of interferon-alpha than cells from control children. Plasma zinc levels in DS appeared to be normal. These findings not only provide evidence that the primary immune defect in DS involves low levels of T cells, but they show depressed number and function of helper T cells and suggest defective IL- 2 receptor expression in DS...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Dermatophytes are {{responsible}} for most superficial fungal infections and the estimated lifetime risk of acquiring a dermatophyte infection is between 10 - 20 %. These fungi are mainly classified in three major genera Microsporum, Trichophyton and Epidermophyton. Materials and Methods Clinically suspected 200 cases of dermatophyte infected patients from K. R. Hospital Mysore and Mission Hospital Mysore were included in this descriptive study from January 2011 to June 2012. All the culture positive smear- 10 % Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) and culture in different dermatophytic medium patients were confirmed by PCR and source of infection was detected (n= 10) from PCR positive patients and (n= 10) from their domestic animals by PCR-RFLP methods targeting 18 S rDNA regions of fungi. Results Out of 200 clinically suspected cases KOH mount was positive in 143 (71. 5 %) cases and culture was positive in 132 (66 %) cases. The isolates belonged to three genera and eight species as T. mentagrophytes 52 (39. 4 %), T. rubrum 30 (22. 7 %), T. violacium 18 (13. 6 %), T. verrucosum 11 (8. 3 %), E. floccosum 10 (7. 6 %), M. canis 6 (4. 5 %), T. tonsurans 03 (2. 3 %) and T. schollenii 2 (1. 5 %). To identify the source of infection 10 animals,one each from the houses of 10 patients who were PCR positive were also subjected to PCR and RFLP. The animals and the patients {{were found to be}} infected by same organisms T. verrucosum. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>T.</b> verrucosum infection is from animal source. Conclusion Dermatophytic infections are more common infectious disease. Preliminary diagnosis of dermatophytosis can be done by KOH mount and culture, which takes longer time to report and cannot differentiate at the genus and species level. Results indicate that PCR-RFLP may be considered as gold standard for the diagnosis and confirmation of source of infection of dermatophytosis and can aid the clinician in initiating prompt and appropriate antifungal therapy.

40|$|Prior {{to these}} studies, the {{literature}} indicated {{an essential role}} for CD 8 + T cell-mediated cytotoxicity in control of brucellosis (B. abortus). The initial effort in these studies {{was to develop a}} cytotoxicity assay {{that could be used to}} identify individual B. melitensis proteins that activate cytotoxic T cells. This effort failed. ^ Therefore, studies were undertaken to assess the role of the CD 8 + T cell in B. melitensis immunity. Overall, male CD 8 knockout mice showed vaccine-induced protection from infection indistinguishable from that observed in control mice. However, limited individual CD 8 knockout mice showed exacerbation of infection. To eliminate possible variation induced by stress, female mice were used in subsequent experiments. ^ Female Fas mutant and perforin and CD 8 knockout mice clear a primary B. melitensis infection normally, and, compared to control mice, show a similar humoral immune response, equivalent expression of markers of T cell memory, T cell proliferation and interferon-gamma production. Therefore, it is clear that cytotoxicity does not play a key role in the immune response to B. melitensis. ^ Nonetheless, further studies were undertaken to fully elucidate the role of the CD 8 + T cell. Unseparated spleen cells and CD 8 and CD 4 + T cells from immunized or virulent Brucella-exposed BALB/c mice were stimulated in vitro and incubated with Brucella-infected J 774 cells. Only T cells from virulent B. melitensis-exposed mice induced reduction in the bacterial load. This effect was abrogated by treatment with anti-Î³-IFN. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>T</b> cell-derived Î³-IFN can mediate suppression of intracellular B. melitensis proliferation, however, immunization may not induce this effect. ^ However, a final experiment showed that CD 8 and CD 4 + T cells and unseparated spleen cells from immunized mice specifically produce Î³-IFN in vitro. This strongly indicates that immunization induces Î³-IFN-producing, memory CD 8 + T cells. This assay can now be used to evaluate B. melitensis proteins for their ability to stimulate Î³-IFN production from CD 8 + T cells. When key proteins are identified, they can be delivered as subunits for the possible eventual construction of a vaccine that specifically induces Î³-IFN production from CD 8 + T cells in vivo. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to study the {{pathological}} changes in the lungs and livers with hydatid disease of slaughtered cattle and sheep. Lungs and livers of 521 cattle and 675 sheep were examined. Infection rates of 4. 8 % and 1. 8 % were recorded in cattle and sheep, respectively. The predilection sites in cattle were the lungs and the livers, while in sheep cysts were only found in the livers. In cattle, lung and liver, cysts were mostly of medium size (2 â 4 cm), but large cysts (> 4 cm) were, also, observed, while most of sheep liver cysts were small in size (< 2 cm). The amount of fluid from hydatid cyst of cattle ranged from 0. 2 to 50 ml; only one cyst contained 600 ml. In sheep, the cyst contained small amounts of liquid with a maximum of 3 ml. The fertility rates of the cysts were 23. 4 % and 11. 1 % in cattle and sheep, respectively. Cyst sections from infected lungs of cattle showed laminated membranes surrounded by a zone of cellular infiltration of mainly lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages and rarely neutrophils, eosinophils and giant cells and the outermost fibrous tissue reaction. Calcification was, also, observed. The neighbouring tissues showed atelectasis, emphysema, haemorrhage, congestion and fibrosis. Sections from the second, third and fourth centimeters away from the cyst walls showed similar but less pronounced pathological reactions. In liver cyst sections, the pathological changes were almost similar to that observed in the lungs with atrophy and necrosis of hepatocytes. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that all slides stained with markers for CDÂ³ and CDÂ²Âº showed positive reaction for CDÂ³ and negative for CDÂ²Âº. This finding suggests that the cellular reaction in the hydatid cyst wall consists mainly of T-lymphocytes. In all liver and lung sections from cattle and sheep stained with Massonâs trichrome stain, and fibrous tissues in the hydatid cyst capsules or around blood vessels and air passages stained green. The acellular laminated membranes and the protoscolices, also, stained green. In hydatid cyst sections from cattle and sheep stained with Periodic Acid Scheff (PAS), and laminated membranes, germinal layers and protoscolices took positive PAS magenta colour. It is concluded {{that the presence of}} cyst in an infected organ causes pathological changes in tissues around the cyst and further away from the cyst. It is, also, concluded that T-lymphocytes (CDÂ³ positive cells) appear to dominate the mononuclear infiltrate as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>T.</b> lymphocytes play a role in immunological reaction against hydatid cys...|$|E
40|$|Sjogren's {{syndrome}} (SS) is an {{autoimmune disease}} characterized by lymphocytic infiltration into lacrimal and salivary glands leading to symptomatic dry eyes and mouth. Immunohistological studies have clarified {{that the majority}} of infiltrating lymphocytes around the lacrimal glands and labial salivary glands are CD 4 positive alphabeta T cells. To analyze the pathogenesis of T cells infiltrating into lacrimal and labial salivary glands, we examined T cell clonotype of these cells in both glands from four SS patients using PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and a sequencing method. SSCP analysis showed <b>that</b> some infiltrating <b>T</b> cells in both glands expand clonally, suggesting that the cells proliferate by antigen-driven stimulation. Intriguingly, six to sixteen identical T cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta genes were commonly found in lacrimal glands and labial salivary glands from individual patients. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> some <b>T</b> cells infiltrating into both glands recognize the shared epitopes on autoantigens. Moreover, highly conserved amino acid sequence motifs were found in the TCR CDR 3 region bearing the same TCR Vbeta family gene from four SS patients, supporting the notion that the shared epitopes on antigens are limited. In conclusion, these findings suggest <b>that</b> some autoreactive <b>T</b> cells infiltrating into the lips and eyes recognized restricted epitopes of a common autoantigen in patients with SS...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTulbaghia violacea Harv. (Alliaceae) {{is one of}} the few {{medicinal}} plants that is also frequently used as a leafy vegetable. Application of cadmium (Cd) at 2 and 5 mg/L to T. violacea plants of various sizes (small 8 â 10 g, medium 16 â 20 g, large 80 â 95 g) elicited a difference in growth response, Cd accumulation and micronutrient distribution. Application of Cd up to 5 mg/L had no significant effect on growth parameters of large-sized plants while leaf length and fresh weight of leaves of the medium-sized plants decreased with application of Cd at 2 mg/L, and 5 mg/L. Cadmium significantly decreased the number of leaves in small-sized plants. Small plants accumulated more Cd in the leaves than medium or large-sized plants. Application of Cd at 2 and 5 mg/L lowered the leaf Cu, Fe, Mo and Zn contents in small and medium-sized plants but had no effect on the micronutrients in large-sized plants. <b>This</b> study <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>T.</b> violacea has the ability to accumulate Cd.

40|$|Hormesis and {{paradoxical}} {{effects are}} frequently found for different plant parameters. These phenomena were also observed for lipid peroxidation (LP) rate at environmental pollution. However, {{the role of}} antioxidant enzymes, particularly guaiacol peroxidases (GPX), in a nonmonotonic variation in the LP rate remains insufficiently explored. Therefore, dependence of GPX activity and LP rate in Betula pendula and Tilia cordata leaf on motor traffic pollution intensity was studied. Regression analysis revealed dependences of LP rate and GPX activity on traffic intensity. In B pendula, GPX activity enhanced significantly (up to 2. 8 times relatively control) under increased traffic that induced biphasic paradoxical effect for LP rate. In the first phase, LP level increased {{in comparison with the}} control, and in the second phase, it was normalized by enhanced GPX activity. In T cordata, dependences of GPX activity and LP rate on traffic pollution were paradoxical effects. However, there was no connection between change of GPX activity and LP rate under middle- and high-level pollution: LP level reduced relatively the control or normalized even if GPX activity was lower than the control. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> in <b>T</b> cordata, other regulatory mechanisms instead of GPX were activated which could control LP rate under middle- and high-level pollution...|$|R
