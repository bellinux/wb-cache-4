5|$|Another {{element in}} the {{ideology}} of the party was a populist fight against <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>establishment,</b> often manifested through political scandals which flourished in 1990s Belgium; including corruption, food and even pedophile scandals. These included the Agusta scandal and the Marc Dutroux affair. The usual suspects were politicians in the three traditional party families; especially the francophone parties.|$|E
5|$|It {{has never}} been fully {{explained}} what motivated the attack: the gunmen {{claimed to have been}} acting on their own initiative, and despite abundant conspiracy theories, no convincing evidence surfaced to suggest that any political leader or party was behind the attack. Nevertheless, the killings left a leadership void in <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>establishment.</b> Conspiracy theories immediately flourished that the gunmen had been acting on orders to sabotage a Karabakh peace deal, but a decade on, the available evidence still pointed to the leading gunman being a loner with a grudge against the Armenian political elite.|$|E
5|$|Richard's posthumous {{reputation}} {{has been}} shaped {{to a large extent}} by William Shakespeare, whose play Richard II portrayed Richard's misrule and his deposition by Bolingbroke as responsible for the 15th-century Wars of the Roses. Modern historians do not accept this interpretation, while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition. While probably not insane, as historians of the 19th and 20th centuries believed, he may have had what psychologists today identify as a personality disorder, particularly manifesting itself towards the end of his reign. Most authorities agree that, even though his policies were not unprecedented or entirely unrealistic, the way in which he carried them out was unacceptable to <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>establishment,</b> and this led to his downfall.|$|E

5000|$|Al-Banna was a {{religious}} Muslim {{who opposed the}} notion of an [...] "Islamic state", for it is abused by politicians for political ends whereby both the Muslims and Islam are harmed.

5|$|The {{lack of an}} heir {{who could}} feasibly provide a new {{direction}} for the nation also diminished the long-term prospects of the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor loved his daughter Isabel, but he considered {{the idea of a}} female successor as antithetical to the role required of Brazil's ruler. He viewed the death of his two sons as being a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted. Resistance to accepting a female ruler was also shared by <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>establishment.</b> Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was still very traditional, and only a male successor was thought capable as head of state.|$|E
5|$|Born in a {{small town}} in the state of Veracruz, Martínez Pérez left her {{hometown}} to study journalism at Universidad Veracruzana. After graduating from university, she went to work at a state-owned television company in Chiapas in the early 1980s, but she encountered various forms of censorship that convinced her to pursue a career in print media. After five years in Chiapas, Martínez Pérez relocated to Veracruz and worked for several local newspapers. In Veracruz, Martínez Pérez faced several challenges of censorship by <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>establishment</b> for her direct reporting, and particularly for being an outspoken critic of human rights violations, government corruption, abuse of authority, and for her in-depth coverage of the drug trafficking organizations that operate in Veracruz.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>establishment</b> in South Vietnam {{was still}} in turmoil. Following the coup that ousted Ngô Đình Diệm, the {{military}} situation quickly worsened as the Viet Cong gained significant ground in the countryside because the Military Revolutionary Council which governed South Vietnam, lacked direction {{both in terms of}} policy and planning. Furthermore, General Dương Văn Minh, as the Chairman of the Military Revolutionary Council, and his civilian Prime Minister Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ favoured a political resolution instead of using military force, which brought them into conflict with the United States over the best strategy to end the Communist threat in South Vietnam. As a result, both men became increasingly unpopular among the military generals who held real political power in Saigon. On January 30, 1964, General Nguyễn Khánh successfully ousted Dương Văn Minh from the Military Revolutionary Council without firing a single shot. For much of the year, Khánh spent most of his efforts on consolidating political power, instead of fighting the Viet Cong.|$|E
5000|$|The {{movement}} was initiated by Danish and Swedish university {{students in the}} 1840s, with a base in Scania. In <b>the</b> beginning, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>establishments</b> in <b>the</b> two countries, including the absolute monarch Christian VIII and Charles XIV with his [...] "one man government", were suspicious of the movement. The police in Denmark therefore kept the proponents of Scandinavism under close watch.|$|R

5000|$|An article {{published}} in 2007 by The South China Morning Post stated that [...] "two members of the so-called Team Mawar have been promoted to important military posts". In the same article, Haris Azhar, from the Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence, said that [...] "the Team Mawar case was another example of <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>establishment's</b> reluctance to settle human rights abuses and pursue meaningful reform of the TNI".|$|R
5|$|Michael de la Pole {{had been}} {{instrumental}} in the marriage negotiations; he had the king's confidence and gradually became more involved at court and in government as Richard came of age. De la Pole came from an upstart merchant family. When Richard made him chancellor in 1383, and created him Earl of Suffolk two years later, this antagonised the more established nobility. Another member of the close circle around the king was Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford, who in this period emerged as the king's favourite. Richard's close friendship to de Vere was also disagreeable to <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>establishment.</b> This displeasure was exacerbated by the earl's elevation to the new title of Duke of Ireland in 1386. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham suggested {{the relationship between the}} king and de Vere was of a homosexual nature, due to a resentment Walsingham had toward the king.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the 1970s, Chinese {{nationalist}} {{dominance of}} the government began to recede. This was {{due to a lack}} of a political or social theory that would justify continued Chinese nationalist dominance, meritocratic policies which allowed local Taiwanese to move up in <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>establishment,</b> and economic prosperity which allowed for social mobility for those outside of <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>establishment.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{response}} of the government was to cut spending and institute a multitude of reforms to improve Sweden's competitiveness, among them reducing the welfare state and privatising public services and goods. Much of <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>establishment</b> promoted EU membership, and the Swedish referendum passed with 52% in favour of joining the EU on 13 November 1994. Sweden joined the European Union on 1 January 1995.|$|E

They noted, however, that during elections for the European Parliament, UKIP was able to broaden its support to gain the vote of largely middle-class Eurosceptics who vote Conservative in other elections.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} when Yugoslavia was {{established}} as a nation, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>establishment</b> in Bosnia and Herzegovina was dominated by Serb and Croat policies; neither of the two terms, Bosnian or Bosniak, was recognized to identify the people as a constituent nation. Consequently, Bosnian Muslims, or anyone who claimed a Bosnian/Bosniak ethnicity, were classified in Yugoslav population statistics as under the category 'regional affiliation.' This classification {{was used in the}} last Yugoslav census taken in 1991 in Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
25|$|After {{leaving office}} in December 2002, Moi lived in retirement, largely shunned by <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>establishment.</b> However, he still {{retained}} some popularity with the masses, and his presence {{never failed to}} gather a crowd. He spoke out against {{a proposal for a}} new constitution in 2005; according to Moi, the document was contrary to the aspirations of the Kenyan people. After the proposal was defeated in a November 2005 constitutional referendum, President Kibaki called President Moi to arrange for a meeting to discuss the way forward.|$|E

25|$|McKenzie {{understood}} {{the importance of}} developing a strong and influential base of White members.

McKenzie viewed himself as an important link to the white community and aware that meaningful Indian advancement required white support.|$|E

25|$|Lenihan is {{a member}} of a famous Irish {{political}} dynasty. His father Brian Lenihan, Snr, first elected in 1957, was a cabinet minister for over twenty-five years, Tánaiste, MEP, and a candidate for President in the 1990 election. His grandfather was Patrick Lenihan who followed his son into the Dáil from 1965 until 1970. Lenihan's aunt Mary O'Rourke was first elected as a TD in 1982, served for a time in the Senate, and is also a former cabinet minister. His brother Conor was a TD from 1997 to 2011 and served as a Minister of State.
