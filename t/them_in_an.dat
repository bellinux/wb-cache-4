5|$|After {{the battle}} of Stalingrad in February 1943, Himmler {{realised}} that Germany would likely lose the war, and ordered the formation of Sonderkommando 1005, a special task force under SS-Standartenführer Paul Blobel. The unit's assignment was to visit mass graves on the Eastern Front to exhume bodies and burn <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attempt {{to cover up the}} genocide. The task remained unfinished {{at the end of the}} war, and many mass graves remain unmarked and unexcavated.|$|E
5|$|Most of Paine's {{arguments}} {{had long}} been available to the educated elite, but by presenting <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> engaging and irreverent style, he made deism appealing and accessible to a mass audience. Originally distributed as unbound pamphlets, the book was also inexpensive, putting it within the reach {{of a large number}} of buyers. Fearing the spread of what they viewed as potentially revolutionary ideas, the British government prosecuted printers and book-sellers who tried to publish and distribute it. Nevertheless, Paine's work inspired and guided many free thinkers.|$|E
5|$|The Ayyubid sultan, Al-Adil I, stormed {{into the}} County of Tripoli, {{creating}} {{an opportunity for}} Leo to plunder the land around Antioch in 1208. Bohemond persuaded Kaykaus I, Sultan of Rum, to invade Cilicia, forcing Leo to withdraw from Antioch. Pope Innocent tasked Albert Avogadro, Patriarch of Jerusalem, to mediate a peace. Avogadro, who was an ally of the Knights Templar, urged Leo to return Bagras to <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>an</b> attempt to renew the truce, Leo obeyed the legate's demand, promising to withdraw from Bagras.|$|E

5|$|A. V. M. Rajan portrayed Shanmugasundaram's brother Thangarathnam. According to playwright Crazy Mohan, Gopulu's {{caricature}} {{of the character}} Vaithi in Subbu's novel was similar to Nagesh, who portrayed Vaithi in the film. Manorama played the wildly expressive, loud-talking but tender-hearted folk dancer Karuppayi, who has to contend with living under the shadows of landlords; she changes her identity {{every now and then}} to escape from <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>an</b> interview with Maalai Malar, Manorama stated that she was initially nervous acting in front of Ganesan and Balaiah, but Nagarajan assured her that whenever her character appeared she would be the centre of attention, which gave her the confidence to play her role. Serial and theatre artist M. L. Bhanumathi played the nurse who treats Shanmugasundaram. Other supporting actors included K. Sarangkapani, S. Ramarao, M. K. Murthy, Balusundaram, T. N. Sivadhanu, S. R. Dasarathan, Sivasooriyan, Senthamarai, Kallapart Natarajan, Gundu Karuppaiah, Chandranbabu, S. V. Rajagopal, A. M. Maruthappa, Udayachandrika, Ambika and Kalpalatha.|$|E
5|$|Coinage {{began on}} the first United States silver dollar, known as the Flowing Hair dollar, in 1794 {{following}} the construction and staffing of the Philadelphia Mint. The Coinage Act of 1792 called for the silver coinage to be struck in an alloy consisting of 89.2% silver and 10.8% copper. However, Mint officials were reluctant to strike coins with the unusual fineness, so {{it was decided to}} strike <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> unauthorized alloy of 90% silver instead. This caused depositors of silver to lose money when their metal was coined. During the second year of production of the Flowing Hair dollar, it was decided that the denomination would be redesigned. It is unknown what prompted this change or who suggested it, though numismatic historian R.W. Julian speculates that Henry William de Saussure, who was named Director of the Mint on July 9, 1795, may have suggested it, as he had stated a redesign of the American coinage as one of his goals before taking office. It is also possible that the Flowing Hair design was discontinued owing to much public disapproval.|$|E
5|$|Friday {{made his}} debut for Walthamstow on 27 March 1971, against Bromley, {{coming off the}} bench to set up Walthamstow's equaliser. His first goal came on 17 April, when playing against Tooting & Mitcham he once again {{appeared}} as a substitute and scored a header late in the game. He joined west London club Hayes in December 1971 after scoring twice against <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> Isthmian League match. Hayes offered £30 per week, and were also based closer {{to his home in}} Acton. A near-fatal accident at work in July 1972 caused Friday to undergo extensive surgery; while working on a roof in Lambeth, a hoist rope became stuck on the scaffold he was working on. The Hayes forward attempted to free the rope but fell and landed on a large spike: the spike went up through one of his buttocks, through his stomach and narrowly avoided a lung. Not only was Friday strong enough to pull himself off the spike, he recovered from his injuries within three months and returned to the Hayes team in October 1972.|$|E

5|$|In 903, the Qarmatian leader al-Husayn ibn Zikrawayh {{was imprisoned}} in al-Rahba before being {{transferred}} to Caliph al-Mustakfi's custody in Raqqa. At the time, al-Rahba {{was the center}} of the Euphrates province and headquarters of its governor, Ibn Sima. Al-Husayn was executed, prompting his partisans from the Banu Ullays tribe to submit to Ibn Sima in al-Rahba in early 904. However, shortly after, they turned against Ibn Sima, whose forces routed <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ambush in al-Rahba's environs in August. Following further battles, Ibn Sima received another round of surrenders by Qarmatian chieftains and da'is (Ismaili religious leaders). In March 928, the Qarmatians under Abu Tahir al-Jannabi conquered al-Rahba and massacred scores of its inhabitants. Its residents faced hardships for several more years due to civil strife in the surrounding region. Peace was established in 942 with the arrival of a certain Abbasid commander named Adl who was dispatched by Bajkam, the strongman of the Baghdad-based caliphate. Adl subsequently became governor of the Euphrates and Khabur valley regions.|$|E
5|$|In many applications, {{the noble}} gases {{are used to}} provide an inert atmosphere. Argon {{is used in the}} {{synthesis}} of air-sensitive compounds that are sensitive to nitrogen. Solid argon is also used for the study of very unstable compounds, such as reactive intermediates, by trapping <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> inert matrix at very low temperatures. Helium is used as the carrier medium in gas chromatography, as a filler gas for thermometers, and in devices for measuring radiation, such as the Geiger counter and the bubble chamber. Helium and argon are both commonly used to shield welding arcs and the surrounding base metal from the atmosphere during welding and cutting, as well as in other metallurgical processes and in the production of silicon for the semiconductor industry.|$|E
5|$|In spring 829, Michael II sent a new fleet to Sicily under Theodotus, who {{was well}} acquainted with the island, having already served as its strategos in the past. After landing, Theodotus marched his army to Enna, where the Arabs were {{continuing}} the siege. He was defeated in the subsequent battle, but {{was able to find}} refuge in the fortress with most of his men. The Muslims now became so confident of victory that they struck their first coins on the island, in the name of Ziyadat Allah and Muhammad ibn Abu'l-Jawari, who however died a short while after and was replaced by Zubayr ibn Gawth. Shortly after that, Theodotus managed to reverse the situation: he led a sally that routed a Muslim raiding party and then defeated the main Muslim army on the next day, killing 1,000 men and pursuing the rest up to the Muslims' fortified encampment, which he placed under siege. The Muslims tried to break out in a night sortie, but Theodotus was expecting such a move and routed <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ambush.|$|E

5|$|Jack Donaghy, who is Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric, {{makes an}} {{appearance}} on the fictional CNBC show The Hot Box. During the appearance, Jack interacts with the show's host, Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks), with the two flirting during the broadcast. Avery and Jack share Republican viewpoints, and she asks him out for a drink after the show, which he accepts. They eventually embark {{on a number of}} both successful and unsuccessful dates. During one of those dates, Jack invites her to a TGS VIP party he has hastily staged, whereupon he enlists the help of Jon Bon Jovi—at the time NBC's real-life Artist in Residence—to come over and talk to <b>them,</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> effort to impress the successful Avery. When Bon Jovi approaches them, though, Jack disregards him due to his own intriguing conversation with Avery, which impresses her even more. After the TGS party, the two go back to Jack's apartment and end up sleeping together.|$|E
5|$|North Koreans {{had also}} {{approached}} Yongsan from the south. The US 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company and tanks of the 72nd Tank Battalion opposed <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> intense fight. In this action, Sergeant First Class Charles W. Turner of the Reconnaissance Company particularly distinguished himself. He mounted a tank, operated its exposed turret machine gun, and directed tank fire which reportedly destroyed seven North Korean machine guns. Turner and this tank came under heavy North Korean fire which shot away the tank's periscope and antennae and scored more than 50 hits on it. Turner, although wounded, {{remained on the}} tank until he was killed. That night North Korean soldiers crossed the low ground around Yongsan and entered the town from the south.|$|E
5|$|Ramones is {{the debut}} studio album by American punk rock band the Ramones, {{released}} on April 23, 1976 by Sire Records. After Hit Parader editor Lisa Robinson saw the band at a gig in New York City, {{she wrote about}} <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> article and contacted Danny Fields, insisting that he be their manager. Fields agreed and convinced Craig Leon to produce Ramones, and the band recorded a demo for prospective record labels. Leon persuaded Sire president Seymour Stein {{to listen to the}} band perform, and he later offered the band a recording contract. The Ramones began recording in January 1976, needing only seven days and $6,400 to record the album. They used similar sound-output techniques to those of the Beatles and used advanced production methods by Leon.|$|E

Kỳ was the most convenient outlet, as the air force along with both the American and South Vietnamese military headquarters were adjacent to one another at Tan Son Nhut, making communication easy, whereas Thi was commanding I Corps in the far north. Westmoreland communicated with Kỳ through the latter’s adviser, Robert R. Rowland. Despite his inconvenient geographical location, Thi was seen as being hostile to Khánh by this point in time, and as a supporter of and commander of a region which {{was seen as the}} Buddhist heartland of Vietnam, he and his grassroots support base were strongly opposed to the Diemist pro-Catholic ideology espoused by Phát and Thảo.|$|E

5|$|Ultima Underworld II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{that takes place}} from a character's eye view in a three-dimensional (3D) graphical environment. The player's goal is to adventure through dungeon-like indoor environments across eight parallel dimensions, while completing quests to help the inhabitants of each world. The player uses a freely movable mouse cursor {{to interact with the}} game's world and to manipulate the heads-up display (HUD) interface. Icons on the HUD allow the player to examine objects closely, to converse with non-player characters (NPCs) and to ready the player character's weapon, among other things. During the game, the player collects items and stores <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> inventory on the HUD. Because it uses the same engine as its predecessor, Ultima Underworld II shares many of that game's features. For example, it allows the player character to jump and swim, and it contains an automap.|$|E
