5|$|Plans for freeways in Los Angeles County {{evolved from}} a 1937 Automobile Club of Southern California plan, which was {{modified}} by the city's Transportation Engineering Board (TEB) in 1939. The former included a single freeway connecting Los Angeles <b>to</b> <b>Long</b> Beach, beginning at Pasadena and heading south-southwest to Lynwood, then paralleling Long Beach Boulevard <b>to</b> <b>Long</b> Beach. The TEB's plan shifted this route farther east to near the present Long Beach Freeway, while keeping the route near Long Beach Boulevard as a second freeway leaving the Ramona Parkway (San Bernardino Freeway) east of downtown and heading south near Alameda Street and Long Beach Boulevard <b>to</b> <b>Long</b> Beach. This second freeway {{came to be known}} as the Long Beach Parkway or Alamitos Parkway, and connected in north Long Beach with a Terminal Island Freeway southwest to Terminal Island. Because the Long Beach Naval Shipyard was located on the island, the U.S. Navy paid for the construction of the $14 million freeway from the island to Willow Street, including the $5.3 million Schuyler Heim Lift Bridge. Construction began in early 1946, and the completed link was dedicated on January 10, 1948, replacing the older Henry Ford Bridge.|$|E
