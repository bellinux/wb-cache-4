A mass {{would be held}} at 7:15a.m., and breakfast would follow. Boys at <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> would then go to school. All boys over 14 were given a {{religious}} education at the Brother's Cathedral School, whereas the younger boys attended the infants' school at the Convent. All boys were also trained in technical education. Before leaving, <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> trained the boys in all classes of agriculture. This was so the boys were well educated and had the knowledge to become sufficient farmers when they left <b>the</b> <b>orphanage.</b>|$|E
5|$|At present, <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> {{has been}} heavily vandalised, with {{surrounding}} residents regularly {{calling the police}} because the sounds of windows smashing and people entering without permission can be heard and seen frequently. Small grass fires around the building have also been reported. Restorations have been considered by the Goulburn City Council. The council is holding Ferrara accountable for allowing damage at <b>the</b> <b>orphanage,</b> while he {{has come up with}} many development projects for the lot. As a result, city council has not issued Ferrara any development permits until restoration work to <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> is complete.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> had an {{enrollment}} of 70 students aged 4 to 17. By 1898 enrollment stood at 200 students.

5|$|The archdiocese assumed {{control of}} <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> in 1920, and began {{accepting}} orphans from the Juvenile Court of Cook County, {{most of whom}} came from broken homes whose parents did not pay the fines imposed by the court. This discouraged donations and strained <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> financially. Archbishop Samuel Cardinal Stritch, discovering that only 12 of the 255 children were actually orphans and only five of them were Slavs, closed <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> in 1956. The 12 true orphans were moved to Holy Angels Orphanage in Des Plaines. Bishop of Joliet Martin Dewey McNamara gave the former orphanage buildings to St. Procopius Academy, which {{was at that time}} still combined with the college.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, {{the boys}} would play sports, boxing, or other leisure activities, or have hockey or rugby league {{training}} if the weather was suitable. Weekends revolved mainly around sports. Field hockey, rugby league, and other sports were commonly played during the winter time. The boys of <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> had a well-known reputation in Goulburn for their sports abilities; boys who participated in tournaments and games usually did well, winning many trophies. <b>The</b> <b>orphanage</b> also had a football team. Sometimes, the boys would hold fetes or participate in annual concerts and operettas, where they would sing and dance.|$|E
5000|$|In 1903, the Capuchin Friars began {{building}} orphanages for Wayuu children, beginning with <b>the</b> La Sierrita <b>Orphanage</b> built in <b>the</b> Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains. <b>The</b> San Antonio <b>Orphanage,</b> located by <b>the</b> Calancala River, {{was built in}} 1910, and <b>the</b> Nazareth <b>Orphanage,</b> in <b>the</b> Serranía de Macuira mountains, in 1913. <b>The</b> <b>orphanages</b> had influence over the rancherías of Guarrachal, El Pájaro, Carazúa, Guaraguao, Murumana, Garra Patamana, and Karraipía. <b>The</b> Nazareth <b>Orphanage</b> had some control over the rancherías of Taroa, Maguaipa, Guaseipá, and Alpanapause. The friars frequently visited the settlements, inviting the people to attend mass. Wayuu children in <b>the</b> <b>orphanages</b> were educated in traditional European customs.

5|$|Besides {{classes and}} {{vocational}} workshops, <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> operated its own printing press and bindery where it produced its own textbooks, Braille books, and German-language newspapers. It also operated a flour mill and bakery that produced 35,000 {{loaves of bread}} a year, a laundry and clothing-repair service, a carpentry, a pottery factory that produced all the clay utensils used in <b>the</b> <b>orphanage,</b> and a tree and plant nursery. At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, a large brick and tile factory was erected on the premises, which produced one million bricks and 250,000 tiles annually.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, the {{compound}} {{was used by}} the Turkish army and its allies as a barracks. From 1921 to 1927, Theodor Schneller resumed management of <b>the</b> <b>orphanage,</b> overseeing the modernization of the property with electrical and sewage installations, as well as new machinery for the various workshops. His son Ernst directed <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> from 1927 until its confiscation by the British army in 1940. The orphanage's German funding sources were severely curtailed during the 1930s when the Nazi government of Germany banned citizens from sending funds abroad.|$|E

5|$|Ferrara has {{proposed}} a number of redevelopments for <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> itself, and its surroundings. In 2004, he proposed a plan to redevelop the lot and building into 63 residential units. The proposed redevelopment was known as Glebe Gardens. Ferrara planned the construction of gardens and pools on the vacant grounds, but {{the front of the}} complex would face no development. Although the development application was approved by the city council, the plans were dropped because the costs to redevelop the lot were too great. In 2009, work began to revamp <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> and convert it into a retirement village, with trees being cleared to construct a retaining wall. Two metre high walls were going to be built to keep vandals out and to prevent further damage. He also stated {{that he was going to}} the fix up <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> once the proposed townhouses were under construction.|$|E
5|$|Production on <b>The</b> <b>Orphanage</b> {{began on}} May 15, 2006 in Llanes, Asturias. This {{location}} was chosen {{due to the}} area's diverse natural settings that include beaches, caves, cliffs, forests, a small village, and the Partarríu Manor where <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> scenes take place. <b>The</b> <b>orphanage</b> was an old colonial house {{from the end of}} the nineteenth century. Bayona wanted to use certain cinematographic techniques that were impossible to achieve in the house, so several parts of the house were reconstructed in sound stages. After four weeks in Llanes, the team moved to Barcelona to finish up the last ten weeks of filming in sound stages, making over 80% of the film there. Bayona showed the films La residencia and The Innocents to his director of photography on the film, to make special notice of the Scope lensing used in both films.|$|E

5|$|Run by the Sisters of Mercy and the Catholic Church {{until its}} closure, <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> housed males from {{the ages of}} 5 to 16 initially. Its {{capacity}} {{was intended to be}} 100 children, but this peaked to more than 200 during the Second World War. By the 1970s, <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> began taking in female orphans from St. Joseph's because of declining numbers of males. Until its closure, <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> took in more than 2,500 individuals for various reasons. Only four per cent of those who stayed there were actually orphans. The orphanage's residents were given a religious education, and were trained in agriculture. Accounts by former residents state that they suffered severe beatings and punishments, and that they were issued a single set of clothing that was rarely washed. Another claims that some residents endured sexual abuse and rape, not only by the staff, but by older boys, and the caretaker. However, others state that the nuns were tough but fair and remained in contact with them.|$|E
5|$|St. John's Orphanage, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Goulburn Boys Orphanage, is a decommissioned orphanage located on Mundy Street in Goulburn, a town located in New South Wales, Australia. The architect of the building is EC Manfred. The foundation stone was laid and blessed on 17 March 1912 by Bishop John Gallagher of Goulburn, who also blessed the building during its opening ceremony in late 1913. It is two storeys high, and several extensions were added to the building throughout its early history. <b>The</b> <b>orphanage</b> amalgamated with St. Joseph's Orphanage for girls in 1976, and the remaining orphans were placed into group homes. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> was closed in 1978 and rented out to the Youth With A Mission Base until they left in 1994. Since then, <b>the</b> <b>orphanage</b> has remained abandoned.|$|E
