5|$|Due to its short {{lifespan}} after harvest, lettuce {{was originally}} sold relatively {{close to where}} it was grown. The early 20th century saw the development of new packing, storage and shipping technologies that improved the lifespan and <b>transportability</b> of lettuce and resulted in a significant increase in availability. During the 1950s, lettuce production was revolutionized with the development of vacuum cooling, which allowed field cooling and packing of lettuce, replacing the previously used method of ice-cooling in packing houses outside the fields.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{its high}} energy density, easy <b>transportability</b> and {{relative}} abundance, oil {{has become the}} world's most important source of energy since the mid-1950s. Petroleum is also the raw material for many chemical products, including pharmaceuticals, solvents, fertilizers, pesticides, and plastics; the 16 percent not used for energy production is converted into these other materials.|$|E
25|$|The {{objectives}} of education {{was defined as}} being able to perform life saving action to emergency patients on scene until a physician takes over, establish <b>transportability</b> of such patients, monitor and support vital body functions during transportation to a hospital and transport ill, injured or other needy persons - even if non-emergency patients - with appropriate care. The description of the scope in the law largely placed emphasis on the assistance to a physician.|$|E
25|$|JLTV is {{transportable}} by sea, rail, and air. The JLTV will be transportable on {{all classes}} of ocean-going transport ships with minimal dis-assembly. It {{is required to}} be rail-transportable on CONUS and NATO country railways. Air <b>transportability</b> will be by fixed-wing aircraft as large as or larger than the C-130 Hercules and sling-loadable with rotary-wing aircraft such as the CH-47/MH-47, and CH-53. The ambulance variant must be air-dropable by C-5 and C-17 fixed-wing aircraft. The JLTV can be prepared in 30 minutes for transport by aircraft, Maritime Prepositioning Force ships or rail. This is aided by an adjustable-height suspension.|$|E
25|$|Generally, the law gives {{following}} {{objectives for}} the education: A Notfallsanitäter {{has to be}} qualified to perform according to scientific standards and with technical, personal, social and methodic competence for sole responsibility and team oriented work especially in emergency medical treatment und transport of patients. By law the education has to enable the Notfallsanitäter to perform following tasks on his own: scene assessment and security, assessment of patients especially detecting vital threats, decision about calling in assistance, medical treatment of patients including invasive actions, handling of people in crisis situations, establishing and securing <b>transportability</b> of patients, selection of an appropriate transportation target, monitoring, reporting to receiving facility, documentation, communication, quality management, operational responsibilities for equipment including care for hygiene and accident prevention, assisting in medical treatments under supervision of a physician, independent treatment as ordered by a physician, self-responsible medical treatment according to rules given by a medical director, cooperation with other professions.|$|E
2500|$|All HH-60Gs have an {{automatic}} flight control system, night vision goggles lighting and forward looking infrared system that greatly enhances night low-level operations. Additionally, some Pave Hawks have color weather radar and an engine/rotor blade anti-ice system {{that gives the}} HH-60G an all-weather capability. Pave Hawk mission equipment includes a retractable in-flight refueling probe, internal auxiliary fuel tanks, two crew-served (or pilot-controlled) 7.62mm miniguns or [...]50-caliber machine guns and an 8,000 pound (3,600kg) capacity cargo hook. To improve air <b>transportability</b> and shipboard operations, all HH-60Gs have folding rotor blades.|$|E
2500|$|The JLTV {{publicly}} {{emerged in}} 2006. Early government documents noted: [...] "In {{response to an}} operational need and an aging fleet of light tactical wheeled vehicles, the joint services have developed a requirement for a new tactical wheeled vehicle platform that will provide increased force protection, survivability, and improved capacity over the current [...] while balancing mobility and <b>transportability</b> requirements with total ownership costs." [...] The joint service nature of the effort was assured through Congressional language in the Fiscal Year 2006 (FY06) Authorization Act, which mandated that any future tactical wheeled vehicle program would be a joint program.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{contractors}} claimed {{their designs}} were below the 70–84 tons expectation {{of what the}} GCV will weigh. [...] BAE's vehicle weighed 60–70 tons, based on modular armor package, and a 20 percent margin for weight increase the Army had planned for future upgrades would bring it up to 84 tons. [...] General Dynamic's vehicle with a diesel engine weighed 62 tons in its most heavily armored configuration, which increased to 76 tons with the 20 percent future upgrade margin. [...] Removing protection for easier air transportation would have reduced it to 56 tons. [...] The Army's consideration {{to slow down the}} GCV development program gave time to the companies to refine their designs and reduce weight. [...] One way would have been to reduce squad size. [...] A nine-man squad has been identified as best for being able to fight with the possibility of taking casualties with single-vehicle <b>transportability.</b> [...] With a three-man crew, the GCV had to carry 12 men. [...] A greater number of lighter IFVs that carry fewer soldiers would have similar carrying capacity and combined costs and weight to planned GCV numbers. [...] Another way would be an advance in armor designs. [...] Lighter and stronger armor materials had not made radical progressions in recent history, and domestic active protection intercept systems were not yet mature. [...] Foreign systems like the Israeli [...] Trophy had seen combat but cannot yet intercept tank shells. [...] The GCV program originally included an APS, but was then delayed as a feature for later upgrades. [...] The last effort to replace the Bradley was with Future Combat Systems, which developed a vehicle that relied on sensors to avoid danger and an APS in place of heavy armor. [...] It was too ambitious for the time and the vehicle's weight had grown from 19 tons to 30 tons {{by the time it was}} cancelled.|$|E
