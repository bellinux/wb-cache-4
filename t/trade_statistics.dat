Since then the notions of „supermarket” and „self-service” have become synonymous in the mind of large sections of the population. The corner shops have, in the mean time, developed into modern points of sale, close to the consummer. The <b>trade’s</b> <b>statistics</b> show a constantly widening range of goods on offer: in 1958 an average store carried only 998 articles. In 1979 it already amounted to 3. 997 items and in 2000 to 9. 058 articles. The introduction of products requiring explanation was often supported by personnel from service deparments. The service-counter concepts complemented the self-service shelves. In some cases in recent years this has also developed into convenience isles.

In this paper, we present a technique for allowing the widespread sharing of certain media formats including music using a method that keeps track of media possession and other marketing information, but {{in a way that does}} not require user identification. For the user, the main attraction of this scheme is that their identity is not a requirement, usage of reduced-quality media within this system is free and that extended media search is facilitated as an attraction to remain within the system. The content creators and distributors are compensated by this system by them having access to potentially large-scale actual usage and music <b>trading</b> <b>statistics.</b> The preliminary system design presented here, can cleanly coexist with a full-quality music purchase business model, also described briefly. ...|$|R

40|$|Leveraged ETFs are {{a recent}} and very {{successful}} financial innovation. They provide daily returns {{that are in}} a multiple or a negative multiple of the daily returns on a market benchmark. In this paper, we examine the characteristics, <b>trading</b> <b>statistics,</b> pricing efficiency and tracking errors of a sample of leveraged ETFs. We find that these ETFs are traded mainly by retail traders with very short holding periods. Price deviations (from NAV) are small on average, but large premiums and discounts are prone to occur. More interestingly, the behavior of premiums is different between bull (i. e., those with a positive multiple) and bear ETFs (i. e., those with a negative multiple). Our {{findings are consistent with}} the argument that the end-of-day rebalancing of the funds' exposures increases market volatility at the close of a trading day. As for tracking errors, they are small for holding periods of up to a week, but become increasingly larger for longer horizons.

40|$|Many market {{participants}} now employ algorithmic trading, commonly {{defined as the}} use of computer algorithms, to automatically make certain trading decisions, submit orders and manage those orders after submission. Identifying and understanding the impact of algorithmic trading on financial markets has become a critical issue for market operators and regulators. Advanced data feeds and audit trail information from market operators now allow for the full observation of {{market participants}}’ actions. A key question {{is the extent to which}} it is possible to understand and characterize the behaviour of individual participants from observations of trading actions. In this paper, we consider the basic problems of categorizing and recognizing traders (or, equivalently, trading algorithms) on the basis of observed limit orders. These problems are of interest to regulators engaged in strategy identification for the purposes of fraud detection and policy development. Methods have been suggested in the literature for describing trader behaviour using classification rules defined over a feature space consisting of summary <b>trading</b> <b>statistics</b> of volume and inventory, along with derived variables that reflect the consistency of buying or selling behaviour. Our principal contribution is to suggest an entirely different feature space that is constructed by inferring key parameters of a sequential optimization model that we take as a surrogate for the decision-making process of the traders. In particular, we model trader behaviour in terms of a Markov decision process. We infer the reward (or objective) function for this process from observations of trading actions using a process from machine learning known as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). The reward functions learned through IRL then constitute a feature space that can be the basis for supervised learning (for classification or recognition of traders) or unsupervised learning (for categorization of traders). Making use of a real-world data-set from the E-Mini futures contract, we compare two principal IRL variants, linear IRL and Gaussian Process IRL, against a method based on summary <b>trading</b> <b>statistics.</b> Results suggest that IRL-based feature spaces support accurate classification and meaningful clustering. Further, we argue that, because they attempt to learn traders’ underlying value propositions under different market conditions, the IRL methods are more informative and robust than the summary statistic-based approach and are well suited for discovering new behaviour patterns of market participants...|$|R

Offline testing of the developed strategies gives an opportunity to estimate the efficiency of investment management based on such trading technology. Autoregressive models ensure sufficient approximation of the financial time series. The main idea of the paper is to check {{the possibility of using}} two-period-ahead forecasting in trading on foreign exchange taking into account some limitations described in the paper. Using this feature of autoregressive models the efficiency of two-period-ahead forecasting is evaluated in this paper {{as a part of the}} simplest trading strategy on foreign exchange. The trading strategy is based on opening the position on daily average prices predicted by one-period-ahead forecasting and closing the position on take profit level predicted by two-period-ahead forecasting. The advantages and disadvantages of two-period-ahead forecasting implementation in investment management are discovered when testing the trading strategy on foreign exchange.
