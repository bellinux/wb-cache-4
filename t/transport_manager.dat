40|$|Deregulation that {{encouraged}} greater competition in several transport industries has facilitated {{the erosion of}} workers' earnings premiums in these industries. This study examines whether deregulation also influences the relative earnings of low- to mid-level managers in these industries. In contrast to <b>transport</b> workers, <b>managers</b> in airline, railroad, and trucking industries received significant pre-deregulation discounts. Such discounts {{support the hypothesis that}} regulators faced political pressure to constrain the compensation of <b>transport</b> <b>managers.</b> These discounts for airline and railroad managers do not change immediately following deregulation. Such findings are consistent with past findings on CEO compensation in these industries. Only the discounts of managers in trucking decline consistently over the post-deregulation period. The findings in this study indicate that <b>transport</b> <b>managers</b> are not guaranteed improved relative earnings in a more competitive business environment, even if regulators face an easing of political pressure to constrain managerial earnings. © The London School of Economics and the University of Bath 2003...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a multi-criteria methodology for analysing stated preference data on freight transport alternatives {{defined in terms}} of transport attributes. The model used is the UTA model, which, {{on the basis of a}} preference ranking and a goal programming set-up, estimates an additive non-linear utility function made of linear segments. The method is applied to a set of individual stated preference data obtained from freight <b>transport</b> <b>managers,</b> who were interviewed about the importance they gave to six transport attributes: frequency, time, reliability, flexibility, loss, and cost...|$|R

40|$|Travel time {{estimation}} is {{of increasing}} importance as congestion worsens in major urban areas. Travel reliability {{on a given}} corridor may be more for travelers, shippers, and <b>transport</b> <b>managers.</b> This paper examines the use of measured travel time reliability indices for improving real-time transportation management and traveler information, using archived ITS data. Several reliability measures are tested including travel time, 95 th percentile travel time, travel time index, buffer index planning time index, and congestion frequency. Results are aimed at improving {{the ways in which}} travel time reliability is communicated to users and managers through a comprehensive survey...|$|R
50|$|The {{institute}} {{has always}} been a keen advocate of educating young people entering the transport industry. It therefore has its own internal study and examinations scheme known as the Certificate in Transport Management (CTM). Built upon a modular design it encourages young people to join at the level of StInstTA and, with study and mentoring, progress to GrInstTA and then AInstTA. At this point the student may take either the Institute's own internal examinations to be admitted as an MInstTA, or the OCR <b>Transport</b> <b>Managers</b> Certificate of Professional Competence. Passing the OCR examination also allows admission to the Institute as an MInstTA.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} aims {{to estimate}} the relative importance and value for freight shippers of transport qualitative factors: service frequency, transport time, reliability of delivery, carrier's flexibility, and safety. A stated preference experiment with <b>transport</b> <b>managers</b> provided a sample of preference orders among hypothetical transport solutions. A conditional logit model adjusted for handling preference orders (Beggs et al., 1981) {{is applied to the}} sample and to subsamples according to transport distances, goods' values, and so on. This analysis shows that these qualitative factors {{play a significant role in}} the modal choice, and that their relative importance varies according to subsamples. © 2008 LSE and the University of Bath...|$|R

The consortium's plan was to sell the Hiriko to municipalities, including Barcelona, Berlin and San Francisco. The company also planned to promote the cars for cities across Europe to expand their carsharing programs. Among others, <b>transport</b> <b>managers</b> from the Basque biosphere reserve of Urdaibai, Ibiza, Hong Kong and Florianópolis in Brazil expressed interest in using the Hiriko in carsharing systems.

50|$|It {{soon became}} clear that the Freeline, like the Regal IV, Royal Tiger and Guy Arab UF, was over-engineered for UK {{operating}} conditions. A typical bodied 39-seat coach could weigh more than a 60-seat half-cab double-decker bus. Leyland, AEC and Guy developed lightweight chassis for the home market, but there was not to be a Daimler equivalent to the Leyland Tiger Cub, AEC Reliance or Guy Arab LUF. Geoffrey Hillditch, a well-known and respected passenger <b>transport</b> <b>manager,</b> who ordered the last Freelines built, expressed regret that Daimler did not build such a vehicle.|$|E

30|$|Within {{the wide}} range of road freight surveys, the {{characteristics}} of roadside freight surveys are particularly interesting. First, they are widely used, and yield a lot of data. Second, given the structure of the costs involved in implementing a roadside survey, the incremental cost of adding a few extra questions to existing forms is fairly small, provided they can be asked and answered quickly. Third, they involve face-to-face contacts between interviewers and truck drivers. As such, they generally obtain excellent response rates, and, more importantly, they offer special opportunities to obtain information on road freight transport operations: truck drivers are of course not freight <b>transport</b> <b>managers,</b> but they know more about the transport operations they are involved in than what they are usually asked about.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} a {{framework}} for mitigating supply chain uncertainty and risk by adopting logistics innovation capability. Due to the increased globalised supply chain operations, logistics and transport industries now face more supply chain uncertainties and risks than ever. Managing these supply chain uncertainties and risks is a priority task to logistics and <b>transport</b> <b>managers.</b> Based on resource based review, logistics innovation capability provides valuable insight into mitigating supply chain uncertainty and risk. This paper focuses {{on the relationship between}} logistics innovation capability and supply chain uncertainty and risk. This would illustrate the potential solutions for mitigating supply chain uncertainty and risk systematically. In addition to make a contribution for development supply chain uncertainty and risk management strategy...|$|R
5000|$|High-commitment {{management}} practices are currently considered a universal approach [...] {{seen to be}} effective in all firms, however the best form of management for a firm with a price-sensitive, high-volume commodity market will differ from a firm with a high-quality, low-volume market. This has been seen within the private and public sectors, where only some high-commitment {{management practices}} in the private sector have the same benefits in the public sector and the entire program cannot be <b>transported.</b> <b>Managers</b> may also face difficulty when implementing high commitment management practices as they face a tension between a consistent approach using the same practices throughout the entire workforce or adjusting their practices based on specific needs of different groups. As workforces become more diverse, this tension may become more pronounced.|$|R
