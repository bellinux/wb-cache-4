40|$|Summary and Conclusions Many {{research}} {{groups around the}} globe take a direct route from failure undermonotonic loading to high cycle fatigue. Surprisingly, low cycle fatigue being a border phenomenon between the aforementioned failure phenomena, is often not considered. In the present thesis, the gap between failure under monotonic loading and HCF was closed by thorough LCF analyses. As a practically relevant material, the high-strength aluminium alloy Al 2024 has been chosen. The SRµCT investigations have made it evident that micro-mechanics based porous plasticity damage models are not suitable for this particular alloy due to {{a high number of}} dense particles. The particles are arranged in continuous layers throughout the micro-structure. Studying the microstructure and fracture mechanisms, it can be safely stated that bigger inclusions in Al 2024 sheets and plates are responsible for damage initiation in the LCF regime. Al 2024 thick plate, due to its underlying manufacturing process develops precipitates {{in the middle of the}} plate, creating layers within. A transition of fracture mode, from surface to internal fracture, was observed with increasing plastic range in cyclic experiments. In an ordinary low cycle regime (40 - 200 cycles), a fatal crack is generated by the propagation and frequent coalescence of small surface cracks. Eventually, a mesocrack initiates from the surface of the specimen due to the presence of bigger intermetallics. For a 100 mm thick plate the S-direction has been found to be very brittle when compared to L and <b>T-directions</b> (rolling directions) respectively. Although there is a ductility observed, the resulting failure occurs without macroscopic softening. An identical response was also observed in 4 mm thin sheets. For allowing symmetric strain amplitudes (R = - 1) in such sheets, a oating antibuckling guide has been proposed which successfully prevents buckling at high compressive loading without affecting adversely the mechanical behaviour of the specimen. In summary, the material behaviour in S-direction can be characterised as neither completely brittle nor completely ductile. More precisely, plastic strain accumulation as damage driving process as well as small fatigue crack growth as brittle damage mechanism can be seen for LCF. This led to a conclusion that for modelling low cycle fatigue for these materials, a material model which incorporates both these effects (coupled ductile and brittle) was required. For that purpose, a phenomenological CDM approach was considered in the present thesis. In our earlier analyses in the past, only ductile damage was taken into account. However, since the microstructural arrangement of Al 2024, as observed in our experiments favour also brittle failure modes, a fully coupled ductile-brittle model has been proposed. While ductile damage has been modelled in a similar fashion as advocated formerly by other authors (see, e. g. Lemaitre & Desmorat (2005)), a novel approach was elaborated for brittle damage. In sharp contrast to the ductile damage model, material degradation can already evolve below the yield limit. Since early work on a large number of smooth and notched specimen demonstrated that wide variations in commercial aluminium alloys caused little or no detectable differences in fatigue strength, the novel coupled damage model is also applicable to a wider range of aluminium alloys. The material parameters necessary to use the proposed model can be easily obtained from a hysteresis loop test in order to determine the cyclic stress-strain curve. The predicted LCF lifetimes for A 12024 alloy are in good agreement the respect experiments verifying the underlying assumptions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} divergence form elliptic operators L = div A ∇ in R 2 with a coefficient matrix A = A(x) of bounded measurable functions {{independent of}} the <b>t-direction.</b> The aim of this note is to demonstrate how the proof of the main theorem in [4] can be modified to bounded Lipschitz domains. The original theorem states that the L p Neumann and regularity problems are solvable for 1 < p < p 0 for some p 0 in domains of the form {(x, t) : φ(x) < t}, where φ is a Lipschitz function. The exponent p 0 depends only on the ellipticity constants and the Lipschitz constant of φ. The principal modification of the argument for the original result is to prove the boundedness of the layer potentials on domains of the form {X = (x, t) : φ(e · X) < e ⊥ · X}, for a fixed unit vector e = (e 1, e 2) and e ⊥ = (−e 2, e 1).

Therefore, early detection is essential. We investigated the imaging properties of clinically diagnosed melanocytic choroidal tumors using a nonmydriatic ultra-wide-field scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) with two laser wavelengths to distinguish benign from malignant lesions. Repeated standardized ultrasound (US) evaluation provided reference standard. Methods: In a consecutive series of 49 patients with clinically diagnosed melanocytic &shy;choroidal tumors in one eye, 29 had established melanoma (defined by proven growth on repeated US follow-up) and 20 had nevi (defined by no malignancy according to clinical, US, and growth &shy;characteristics for at least 2 years). All patients underwent clinical examination, undilated Optomap? (Optos PLC, Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland, UK) imaging, standardized US &shy;examination, and standard retinal photography. Measurements of the tumor base using the Optomap software were compared with US B-scan measurements. Imaging characteristics from the SLO images were correlated with the structural findings in the two patient groups. Results: Measurements of tumor base correlated well between SLO and US with r = 0. 61 (<b>T-direction)</b> and r = 0. 51 (L-direction). On SLO imaging, typical malignant lesions appeared dark on the red laser channel and bright on the green laser channel. Based on those simple binary characteristics, a sensitivity of 76 % at a specificity of 70 % was obtained for a correct classification of lesions. When analogous to clinical examination lesion size, margin touching the optic disc, and existence of subretinal fluid were additionally considered, 90 % sensitivity at 82 % specificity was obtained. Conclusions: In this first, limited series, nonmydriatic SLO imaging with two laser wavelengths permitted to differentiate malignant ocular tumors from nonmalignant lesions with high &shy;diagnostic accuracy. Additional parameters may further enhance diagnostic properties, but larger patient series are required to validate our findings and prove the diagnostic properties.
