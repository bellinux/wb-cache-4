5|$|As the American colonies went to war, {{they needed}} soldiers, supplies, {{and lots of}} them. Soldiers needed uniforms and, as all {{shipping}} into the colonies had ceased, wool became an integral commodity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>effort.</b> During the Revolution the consumption of mutton ceased almost entirely in many areas, and in Virginia it became illegal to consume except in cases of extreme necessity.|$|E
5|$|Because of America's {{entry into}} World War I in April 1917 {{and the ongoing}} war effort, several SIAA schools did not field {{football}} teams in 1918.

5|$|The British did {{not return}} to Charleston until 1780, when General Clinton {{successfully}} besieged the city and captured an entire army. Until the South again became a focus of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in late 1778, its states provided military supplies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>war</b> <b>effort</b> and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard currency <b>to</b> fund <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>effort.</b>|$|R

Hoosier women also contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>effort</b> as nurses and volunteers in charitable organizations, most commonly the local Ladies' Aid Societies. In January 1863 Governor Morton and the Indiana Sanitary Commission began recruiting women to work as nurses in military hospitals and on ships.|$|E

5|$|When World War II began, Teller {{wanted to}} {{contribute}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>effort.</b> On {{the advice of}} the well-known Caltech aerodynamicist and fellow Hungarian émigré Theodore von Kármán, Teller collaborated with his friend Hans Bethe in developing a theory of shock-wave propagation. In later years, their explanation of the behavior of the gas behind such a wave proved valuable to scientists who were studying missile re-entry.|$|E

5|$|After the {{elections}} in 1864 the state's Republican legislative majority arrived at a critical turning point, as the North was slowly tightening its blockade of the South. The new Republican-controlled legislature fully supported Morton's policies and worked to meet the state's commitments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>effort.</b> In 1865 the Indiana General Assembly validated the loans Morton had secured to run the state government, assumed them as state debt, and commended Morton for his actions during the interim.|$|E

5|$|As the Merlin was {{considered}} to be so important <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>effort,</b> negotiations were soon started to establish an alternative production line outside the UK. Rolls-Royce staff visited a number of North American automobile manufacturers in order to select one to build the Merlin in the U.S. or Canada. Henry Ford rescinded an initial offer to build the engine in the U.S. in July 1940, and the Packard Motor Car Company was subsequently selected to take on the $130,000,000 Merlin order. Agreement was reached in September 1940, and the first Packard-built engine, a Merlin XX designated the V-1650-1, ran in August 1941.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the state legislature. It was by the actions of Governor Oliver Morton, who illegally borrowed millions of dollars to finance the army, that Indiana could contribute so greatly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>effort.</b> Morton suppressed the state legislature {{with the help of the}} Republican minority to prevent it from assembling during 1861 and 1862. This prevented any chance the Democrats might have had to interfere with the war effort or to attempt to secede from the Union.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, the New Zealand government authorised the formation of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), for service at home and abroad. After consulting with the British Government, it was decided that the main New Zealand contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>effort</b> would be {{in the form of an}} infantry division, the 2nd New Zealand Division, under the command of Major General Bernard Freyberg. The new division would require nine battalions of infantry and consequently, several infantry battalions were formed from 1939 to 1940 with New Zealand volunteers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} stages of {{mobilisation}} a number of militia infantry battalions were called out to carry out guard duties upon infrastructure that was considered important <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>effort,</b> such as munitions factories, communications facilities, ammunition dumps and transportation centres. 500 men from the Kennedy Regiment were sent to Thursday Island from Townsville to garrison the island in response to a possible threat from German forces in the Pacific. Additionally, militia troops were used to establish and guard internment camps and garrison artillery and engineer units from the militia were also mobilised to assist the regular units that were manning coastal defences.|$|E

During his presidency, ordinary citizens enjoyed unprecedented access to housing, education, jobs, health services and nourishment, as well as other forms of social welfare, while feudalistic influence waned. By the end of his presidency, employment and working conditions improved considerably, although poverty was still high in the country and substantial resources allocated for social welfare had been diverted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>effort.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the anniversary}} of her birth, in 1814, the widowed King Frederick William instituted the Order of Louise (Luisenorden) as a {{complementary}} decoration for the Iron Cross.
