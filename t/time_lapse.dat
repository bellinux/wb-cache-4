5|$|The NK 6th Division shifted {{its axis}} of attack {{and its main}} attacking effort to the {{northern}} part of the Chinju-Masan corridor just below the Nam River in the 35th Infantry's sector. The 35th Infantry set to work to cover its front with trip flares, but they were in short supply and gradually it became impossible to replace them. Illuminating flares were also in short supply, and the reserve stocks had deteriorated to such a degree that only about 20 percent of the supply issued to the regiment was effective. Even when employed, the <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> between a request for them and delivery by the big howitzers allowed some North Korean infiltration before the threatened area was illuminated.|$|E

The man is unscathed, but the woman sustains a wound to her leg, which they wrap with a flag brought from when they were creating the sand castle. Deciding that traveling in search of people towards the top of the mountain, where they see a structure, would be a better medical option than heading back home, they continue towards the mountaintops. As night falls, they rest in the wild. The man takes the first guard shift, and the stars in the night sky <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> behind him. He wakes the woman to take his turn to sleep. When he eventually wakes up, the two characters press on with the intention of turning back if they do not find people.|$|E

5|$|Tombaugh's {{task was}} to {{systematically}} capture sections {{of the night sky}} in pairs of images. Each image in a pair was taken two weeks apart. He then placed both images of each section in a machine called a blink comparator, which by exchanging images quickly created a <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> illusion of the movement of any planetary body. To reduce the chances that a faster-moving (and thus closer) object be mistaken for the new planet, Tombaugh imaged each region near its opposition point, 180 degrees from the Sun, where the apparent retrograde motion for objects beyond Earth's orbit is at its strongest. He also took a third image as a control to eliminate any false results caused by defects in an individual plate. Tombaugh decided to image the entire zodiac, rather than focus on those regions suggested by Lowell.|$|E
5|$|In April 1896, Chile ordered another armored cruiser, , and six torpedo boats. Naval {{historian}} Robert Scheina {{states that}} Argentina replied {{in the same}} month with , a near-sister ship to Garibaldi which was under construction in Italy. However, {{he notes that the}} small <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> between the orders makes it difficult or impossible to know if this, the opposite, or either are true. As historian Jonathan Grant writes, the Argentines may have moved first to secure a definite, if momentarily tenuous, advantage over the Chilean Navy. In May 1898, the Chilean government found that the Argentines were planning on acquiring one, then two, Garibaldi-class cruisers. With tensions extremely high and war seemingly imminent, the two countries agreed to submit their boundary disputes to the British, which led to the Cordillera of the Andes Boundary Case 1902 (Argentina, Chile). They also signed pacts which led to the resolution of the Puna de Atacama dispute. As the former arbitration took much time, the naval arms race, though it slacked during the time of eased tension which came with the agreements, continued.|$|E
5|$|Two {{music videos}} were shot {{for the single}} by Luis Hernandez and Satoru Yokoyama, respectively. Hernandez's version opens with busy streets and the dawn of Los Angeles, California. Hamasaki begins singing the song {{on top of a}} skyscraper, whilst several intercut scenes of people walking around Los Angeles during a <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> are shown. She is then seen {{painting}} a picture of an unidentified man, who raps Verbal's part. It then shows intercut scenes of traffic, a carosuel and couple standing near a bridge. Several parts of these scenes are revised throughout the entire video, which ends with Hamasaki again on top of the skyscraper. For Yokoyama's video, only shots featuring Verbal were only filmed, alongside scenes of him walking through a city in Japan, and residing in a neon-lit club. Parts of Hernandez's version, with the scenes of Hamasaki painting a man and scenes of Los Angeles city and public, were removed in order to merge the first video and Verbal's appearance together. This version premiered one week before the album's release on July 2, and was included on the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of Colours.|$|E

40|$|Accepté pour publication. International audienceWe {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of pedestrian evacuations through a narrow doorway by means of controlled experiments. The influence of the pedestrians' behaviours is investigated by prescribing a selfish attitude to a fraction c_s of the participants, while the others behave politely. Thanks to an original setup enabling the re-injection of egressed participants into the room, the analysis is conducted in a (macroscopically) quasi-stationary regime. We find that, as c_s is increased, the flow rate J rises, interpolating between published values for egresses in normal conditions and measurements for competitive evacuations. The dependence of several flow properties on the pedestrian density ρ at the door, independently of c_s, suggests that macroscopically the behavioural aspects could be subsumed under the density, at least in our specific settings with limited crowd pressure. In particular, under these conditions, J grows monotonically with ρ up to " close-packing " (ρ ≈ 9 pers/m²). The flow is then characterised microscopically. Among other quantities, the <b>time</b> <b>lapses</b> between successive escapes, the pedestrians' waiting times {{in front of the}} door, and their angles of incidence are analysed statistically. In a nutshell, our main results show that the flow is orderly for polite crowds, with narrowly distributed <b>time</b> <b>lapses</b> between egresses, while for larger c_s the flow gets disorderly and vanishing <b>time</b> <b>lapses</b> emerge. For all c_s, we find an alternation between short and long <b>time</b> <b>lapses,</b> which we ascribe to a generalised zipper effect. The average waiting time in the exit zone increases with its occupancy. The disorder in the flow and the pressure felt by participants are also assessed...|$|R

25|$|Although jennies {{come into}} heat within 9 or 10 days of giving birth, their {{fertility}} remains low, {{and it is}} likely the reproductive tract has not returned to normal. Thus it is usual to wait one or two further oestrous cycles before rebreeding, unlike the practice with mares. Jennies are usually very protective of their foals, and some will not come into estrus while they have a foal at side. The <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> involved in rebreeding, and the length of a jenny's gestation, means that a jenny will have fewer than one foal per year. Because of this and the longer gestation period, donkey breeders do not expect to obtain a foal every year, as horse breeders often do, but may plan for three foals in four years.|$|E
25|$|The River Wansbeck Valley is {{narrow and}} steep {{and as a}} {{consequence}} has exaggerated amounts of surface runoff. Based on three storm events, a reliable flow gauge located upstream of Morpeth at the confluence of the Wansbeck and Font showed that 56% of rain fall is converted into surface runoff. Because the soil was already saturated {{as a result of the}} wet summer, the effect of surface runoff was greatly enhanced. Furthermore, increased urbanisation since the 1960s in Morpeth meant that most water falling on the town would have drained directly to the river channel. Other tests investigating the catchment lag time (<b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> between the midpoint of storm rainfall and peak river level) indicate that the Wansbeck has a LAG time of only 8 hours. This means that any water falling in the catchment area would have been rapidly converted into channel flow by surface runoff and to a lesser extent by throughflow. This is due to the steepness of the valley and the soil composition.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{demonstrates the}} feasibility of a full-field photographic method for remotely measuring the movement of large deforming objects. 'Large objects' could include civil engineering structures such as dam walls, buildings and bridges, and geological phenomena such as glaciers. Such structures must be examined in situ and preferably by a non contacting method. The objective is to measure motion from <b>time</b> <b>lapsed</b> photographs of the moving object. The method is based on speckle photography which is a well developed optical metrology technique for deformation measurement of engineering structures in laboratory conditions. Its application to large scale structures illuminated in sunlight at high imaging demagnifications has demanded some significant extensions and modifications to the technique. Imaging these large objects offers {{a unique set of}} challenges which include the establishment of rigid tripods from which to take the <b>time</b> <b>lapsed</b> photographs in rugged glacial terrain, the variation of illumination in terms of both quality and angle of incidence, imaging through several kilometres of turbulent atmosphere and recording the signature texture of the object surface onto film at high imaging demagnifications. The effects of these factors are considered both conceptually and experimentally, providing fundamental understanding of the problem. Displacement analysis is performed primarily by interrogation of <b>time</b> <b>lapsed</b> negative pairs using an unexpanded laser beam, as is generally the case in speckle photography. An automated system is developed to make practical the analysis of multiple points in the field of view. In parallel, a new digital technique is introduced where displacement results are obtained by pattern matching in digital versions of the speckle images. This analysis method is shown to be highly suitable for the application to glacier flow. Registration of the pair of <b>time</b> <b>lapsed</b> images is performed by calculating the affine transform describing the image misalignment (introduced at either the recording or analysis stage) within the non-deforming areas of the field of view. Use of this novel technique allows pairs of single exposures, rather than double exposures, to be examined, and it also increases the sensitivity of measurement. Two dimensional motion fields representing glacier flow are presented, leading {{to the conclusion that the}} technique is feasible in sunlight illumination, for a variety of glacial surface types and at high imaging demagnifications...|$|R
