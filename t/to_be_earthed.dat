25|$|The {{depth of}} the sockets varies between {{countries}} and age. Older sockets are so shallow {{that it is possible}} to touch the pins of a plug when the plug is inserted only deep enough to get electrical power on the pins, while newer sockets are deep enough to protect from this kind of accident. CEE7/1 sockets accept CEE7/4, CEE7/6 and CEE7/7 plugs without providing an earth connection. The earthed CEE7/3 and CEE7/5 sockets were specifically designed not to allow insertion of CEE7/2 unearthed round plugs fitted to older appliances which had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>earthed</b> via other means.|$|E

50|$|The brick {{magazine}} {{was used as}} a hall by the local community between the wars, and a photograph, possibly from this period or post World War II, shows a timber skillion extension to {{the east side of the}} magazine building. At this time the ridge ventilator, lightning rods and copper earthing straps were still in place. The lightening rod assembly reportedly survived on a local farm for some time, and consisted of a copper cylinder about 4 inches in diameter, which had holes for three copper spikes (1/2 inch thick by 2 feet long, or 12.7mm by 609.6mm) to jut out at angles, so that the tips were 2 feet apart. Two 2 inch (50.8mm) copper straps at least ¼ inch (6.35mm) thick led down the sides of the building <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>earthed.</b> In the photograph double timber doors are shown in the west end of the magazine, and these may have existed before the building became a hall. These doors are not on the 1887 plans for the magazine. Lead sheeting from under the roofing iron (of either the two timber and iron magazines or the brick magazine) were recycled by locals for stump caps and guttering.|$|E
