25|$|To produce yogurt, milk {{is first}} heated, usually to about 85°C (185°F), <b>to</b> <b>denature</b> the milk {{proteins}} {{so that they}} do not form curds. After heating, the milk is allowed to cool to about 45°C (113°F). The bacterial culture is mixed in, and a temperature of 45°C (113°F) is maintained for four to twelve hours to allow fermentation.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in body temperature {{that results from}} a breakdown in thermoregulation affects the body biochemically. Enzymes involved in metabolic pathways within the body such as cellular respiration fail to work effectively at higher temperatures, and further increases can lead them <b>to</b> <b>denature,</b> reducing their ability to catalyse essential chemical reactions. This loss of enzymatic control affects the functioning of major organs with high energy demands such as the heart and brain.|$|E
25|$|Turkeys {{are usually}} baked or roasted in an oven for several hours, often while the cook prepares the {{remainder}} of the meal. Sometimes, a turkey is brined before roasting to enhance flavor and moisture content. This is necessary because the dark meat requires a higher temperature <b>to</b> <b>denature</b> all of the myoglobin pigment than the white meat (which is very low in myoglobin), so that fully cooking the dark meat tends to dry out the breast. Brining makes it possible to fully cook the dark meat without drying the breast meat. Turkeys are sometimes decorated with turkey frills prior to serving.|$|E

25|$|In higher plants, {{superoxide}} dismutase enzymes (SODs) act as antioxidants and protect cellular components from being oxidized by {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS). ROS can form {{as a result of}} drought, injury, herbicides and pesticides, ozone, plant metabolic activity, nutrient deficiencies, photoinhibition, temperature above and below ground, toxic metals, and UV or gamma rays. To be specific, molecular O2 is reduced to O2− (a ROS called superoxide) when it absorbs an excited electron released from compounds of the electron transport chain. Superoxide is known <b>to</b> <b>denature</b> enzymes, oxidize lipids, and fragment DNA. SODs catalyze the production of O2 and H2O2 from superoxide (O2−), which results in less harmful reactants.|$|E
25|$|Receptor {{desensitization}} {{is mediated}} {{through a combination}} phosphorylation, β-arr binding, and endocytosis as described above. Downregulation occurs when endocytosed receptor is embedded in an endosome that is trafficked to merge with an organelle called a lysosome. Because lysosomal membranes are rich in proton pumps, their interiors have low pH (≈4.8 vs. the pH≈7.2 cytosol), which acts <b>to</b> <b>denature</b> the GPCRs. In addition, lysosomes contain many degradative enzymes, including proteases, which can function only at such low pH, and so the peptide bonds joining the residues of the GPCR together may be cleaved. Whether or not a given receptor is trafficked to a lysosome, detained in endosomes, or trafficked back to the plasma membrane depends {{on a variety of}} factors, including receptor type and magnitude of the signal.|$|E
25|$|Copper is {{reactive}} with acidic foods {{which can}} result in corrosion, the byproducts of which can foment copper toxicity. In certain circumstances, however, unlined copper is recommended and safe, for instance {{in the preparation of}} meringue, where copper ions prompt proteins <b>to</b> <b>denature</b> (unfold) and enable stronger protein bonds across the sulfur contained in egg whites. Unlined copper is also used in the making of preserves, jams and jellies. Copper does not store ("bank") heat, and so thermal flows reverse almost immediately upon removal from heat. This allows precise control of consistency and texture while cooking sugar and pectin-thickened preparations. Alone, fruit acid would be sufficient to cause leaching of copper byproducts, but naturally occurring fruit sugars and added preserving sugars buffer copper reactivity. Unlined pans have thereby been used safely in such applications for centuries.|$|E

The resolution of the system allowed the identification of individual conjugate families which differed only {{in the position of}} acylation or in the number of estrone glucuronide units. Acid-PAGE was a good alternative <b>to</b> <b>denaturing</b> cation-exchange chromatography for the analysis, separation, and small-scale purification of lysozyme-estrone glucuronide conjugates. It revealed the true order of the relative degree of positive charge on the lysozyme-estrone glucuronide conjugates...|$|R

25|$|To {{create a}} western blot, gel {{electrophoresis}} {{is used to}} separate native proteins by 3-D structure or denatured proteins by {{the length of the}} polypeptide. Polyacrylamide gel is generally used for the electrophoretic separation of proteins, and SDS is generally used as a buffer (as well as in the gel) in order to give all proteins present a uniform negative charge, since proteins can be positively, negatively, or neutrally charged. This type of electrophoresis is known as SDS-PAGE (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Prior to electrophoresis, protein samples are often boiled <b>to</b> <b>denature</b> the proteins present. This ensures that proteins are separated based on size and prevents proteases (enzymes that break down proteins) from degrading samples. Following electrophoretic separation, the proteins are transferred to a membrane (typically nitrocellulose or PVDF), where they are blocked with milk (or other blocking agents) to prevent non-specific antibody binding, and then stained with antibodies specific to the target protein. Lastly, the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining, which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods. The gel electrophoresis step is included in western blot analysis to resolve the issue of the cross-reactivity of antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (C12H25NaO4S; mW: 288.38) (only used in {{denaturing}} protein gels) is {{a strong}} detergent agent used <b>to</b> <b>denature</b> native proteins to individual polypeptides. This denaturation, which {{is referred to as}} reconstructive denaturation, is not accomplished by the total linearization of the protein, but instead, through a conformational change to a combination of random coil and α helix secondary structures. When a protein mixture is heated to 100°C in presence of SDS, the detergent wraps around the polypeptide backbone. It binds to polypeptides in a constant weight ratio of 1.4 g SDS/g of polypeptide. In this process, the intrinsic charges of polypeptides become negligible when compared to the negative charges contributed by SDS. Thus polypeptides after treatment become rod-like structures possessing a uniform charge density, that is same net negative charge per unit weight. The electrophoretic mobilities of these proteins is a linear function of the logarithms of their molecular weights. Without SDS, different proteins with similar molecular weights would migrate differently due to differences in mass-charge ratio, as each protein has an isoelectric point and molecular weight particular to its primary structure. This is known as native PAGE. Adding SDS solves this problem, as it binds to and unfolds the protein, giving a near uniform negative charge {{along the length of the}} polypeptide.|$|E
500|$|Deep frying food {{is defined}} as a process where food is {{completely}} submerged in hot oil at temperatures typically between [...] and [...] One common method for preparing food for deep frying involves adding multiple layers of batter around the food, such as cornmeal, flour, or tempura; breadcrumbs may also be used. After the food is submerged in oil, the surface of it begins to dehydrate and it undergoes Maillard reactions which break down sugars and proteins, creating the golden brown exterior of the food. Once the surface is dehydrated, it forms a crust which prevents further oil absorption. The heat conducts throughout the food causing proteins <b>to</b> <b>denature,</b> starches to undergo starch gelatinization, and dietary fiber to soften.|$|E

Moreover, complexes display an important cytokine-like property {{that can be}} exploited to induce positive effects of immuno-modulation in pathologies characterized by either a reduced or exacerbated immune response. In addition, stability of Grp 94 -lgG complexes make them useful as diagnostic tools to detect antibodies directed against Grp 94 in various pathological conditions...|$|R

Additionally, the chlorophyll a-protein band {{with the highest}} specific radioactivity was excised and subjected <b>to</b> <b>denaturing</b> re-electrophoresis. Based on these experiments it is presumed that the native QB protein is associated with pigments and represents a protein moiety of the 43 kDa chlorophyll a-protein (Chl a-P 3) of PS II.

2500|$|Polymers, such as {{dextrans}} and polyethylene glycols, {{are frequently}} used to precipitate proteins {{because they have}} low flammability and are less likely <b>to</b> <b>denature</b> biomaterials than isoelectric precipitation. These polymers in solution attract water molecules away from the solvation layer around the protein. This increases the protein–protein interactions and enhances precipitation.

2500|$|Double-stranded DNA {{fragments}} naturally {{behave as}} long rods, so their migration through the gel is {{relative to their}} size or, for cyclic fragments, their radius of gyration. Circular DNA such as plasmids, however, may show multiple bands, the speed of migration may depend on whether it is relaxed or supercoiled. [...] Single-stranded DNA or RNA tend to fold up into molecules with complex shapes and migrate through the gel in a complicated manner based on their tertiary structure. Therefore, agents that disrupt the hydrogen bonds, such as sodium hydroxide or formamide, are used <b>to</b> <b>denature</b> the nucleic acids and cause them to behave as long rods again.|$|E

While the oil cake from coconut, peanuts, and sometimes cotton seeds can be used as either cattle feed and/or fertilizer, the toxic nature of castor beans precludes their oil cake from being used as feed unless the ricin is first deactivated by autoclaving. Accidental ingestion of Ricinus communis cake intended for fertilizer has been reported to be responsible for fatal ricin poisoning in animals.|$|E
2500|$|LC-MS is [...] used in {{proteomics}} as {{a method}} to detect and identify the components of a complex mixture. The bottom-up proteomics LC-MS approach generally involves protease digestion and denaturation using trypsin as a protease, urea <b>to</b> <b>denature</b> the tertiary structure, and iodoacetamide to modify the cysteine residues. After digestion, LC-MS is used for.peptide mass fingerprinting, or LC-MS/MS (tandem MS) is used to derive sequence of individual peptides. LC-MS/MS is most commonly used for proteomic analysis of complex samples where peptide masses may overlap even with a high-resolution mass spectrometry. Samples of complex biological (e.g., human serum) may be analyzed in modern LC-MS/MS systems, which can identify over 1000 proteins. However, this high level of protein identification is possible only after separating the sample by means of SDS-PAGE gel or HPLC-SCX.|$|E
2500|$|Ricin {{is several}} orders of {{magnitude}} less toxic than botulinum or tetanus toxin, but the latter are harder to come by. Compared to botulinum or anthrax as biological weapons or chemical weapons, the quantity of ricin required to achieve LD50 over a large geographic area is significantly more than an agent such as anthrax (tons of ricin vs. only kilogram quantities of anthrax). Ricin is easy to produce, but is not as practical or likely to cause as many casualties as other agents. Ricin is easily denatured by temperatures over 80°C [...] (175°F) meaning many methods of deploying ricin would generate enough heat <b>to</b> <b>denature</b> it. Once deployed, an area contaminated with ricin remains dangerous until the bonds between chain A or B have been broken, a process that takes two or three days. In contrast, anthrax spores may remain lethal for decades. Jan van Aken, a German expert on biological weapons, explained in a report for The Sunshine Project that Al Qaeda's experiments with ricin suggest their inability to produce botulinum or anthrax.|$|E

The SPA molecule structure includes a signaling sequence [18], an IgG-binding region consisting of five highly homologous domains, and a C-terminal anchoring part, which attaches the protein to the bacterial cell wall [19, 20]. The SPA molecules are highly resistant <b>to</b> <b>denaturing</b> factors: they are thermostable and resistant {{to a wide range of}} pH (1 – 12) and to trypsin cleavage [21].|$|R
2500|$|The Standard Edition of Freud's {{works in}} English confuses two {{terms that are}} {{different}} in German, Instinkt ("instinct") and Trieb ("drive"), often translating both as instinct; for example, [...] "the hypothesis of a death instinct, the task {{of which is to}} lead organic life back into the inanimate state". [...] "This incorrect equating of instinkt and Trieb has created serious misunderstandings". Freud actually refers to the term [...] "instinkt" [...] in explicit use elsewhere, and so while the concept of [...] "instinct" [...] can loosely be referred to as a [...] "drive," [...] any essentialist or naturalist connotations of the term should be put in abeyance. In a sense, the death drive is a force that is not essential to the life of an organism (unlike an [...] "instinct") and tends <b>to</b> <b>denature</b> it or make it behave in ways that are sometimes counter-intuitive.
