500|$|By 1925, Tschaikovsky had {{developed}} a tuberculous infection of her arm, and she {{was placed in a}} succession of hospitals for treatment. Sick and near death, she suffered significant loss of weight. She was visited by the Tsarina's groom of the chamber Alexei Volkov; Anastasia's tutor Pierre Gilliard; his wife, Shura, who had been Anastasia's nursemaid; and the Tsar's sister, Grand Duchess Olga. Although they expressed sympathy, if only for Tschaikovsky's illness, and made no immediate public declarations, eventually they all denied she was Anastasia. In March 1926, she convalesced in Lugano with Harriet von Rathlef at the expense of Grand Duchess Anastasia's great-uncle, Prince Valdemar of Denmark. Valdemar was willing to offer Tschaikovsky material assistance, through the Danish ambassador to Germany, Herluf Zahle, while her identity was investigated. To allow her to travel, the Berlin Aliens Office issued her with a <b>temporary</b> <b>certificate</b> of identity as [...] "Anastasia Tschaikovsky", with Grand Duchess Anastasia's personal details. After a quarrel with Rathlef, Tschaikovsky was moved to the Stillachhaus Sanatorium at Oberstdorf in the Bavarian Alps in June 1926, and Rathlef returned to Berlin.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Security {{attributes}} of a Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) include confidentiality, integrity, authentication, nonrepudiation (liability), revocation and privacy. Privacy, having characteristics opposing {{to the rest}} of the attributes, makes design of a security architecture quite difficult. A commonly used solution is to have a large number of <b>temporary</b> <b>certificates</b> (i. e., pseudonyms) to achieve these security attributes. To guard against their malicious use, these pseudonyms are stored in expensive tamper-proof-devices (TPDs). Further, a large number of valid pseudonyms, at any given time, make non-repudiation and revocation quite complex and difficult to achieve. Another solution is to get pseudonyms blindly signed from a certificate server, thus eliminating the need of TPDs (given the pseudonyms are not generated in bulk). However, blind signatures provide unconditional privacy and thus require complex/multitransaction procedures to ensure non-repudiation/revocation. We present a security architecture by revising the original Blind signature scheme. Our proposed architecture provides “one-waylink-ability” that helps to achieve all the security attributes without introducing complex/multi-transaction procedures. It does not require expensive TPDs or complex pseudonym issuance/revocation procedures and is especially suited to VANET during initial deployment phase which is characterized with intermittent connectivity. Further, nonrepudiation/revocation requires cooperation between multiple entities thus ensuring privacy without a single point of failure.

By May 2017, the number of discrepancies had dropped to 7,264, but it was around this time that the fire alarm systems at each station were deactivated, requiring fire safety chiefs to be posted at each station. , some of these tests had yet to be completed even though the line had been opened for eight months.
