5|$|Other {{factors that}} broaden the main {{sequence}} band on the HR diagram include {{uncertainty in the}} distance to stars {{and the presence of}} unresolved binary stars that can alter the observed stellar parameters. However, even perfect observation would show a fuzzy main sequence because mass is not the only parameter that affects a star's color and luminosity. Variations in chemical composition caused by the initial abundances, the star's evolutionary status, interaction with a close companion, rapid rotation, or a magnetic field can all slightly change a main-sequence star's HR diagram position, <b>to</b> <b>name</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few factors. As an example, there are metal-poor stars (with a very low abundance of elements with higher atomic numbers than helium) that lie just below the main sequence and are known as subdwarfs. These stars are fusing hydrogen in their cores and so they mark the lower edge of main sequence fuzziness caused by variance in chemical composition.|$|E

40|$|Fitting {{a single}} generic AAM on an unseen face (that {{is not in}} the {{training}} set) under any pose and expression is very difficult. The variability of the data is so high that the fitting process usually gets stuck into one of the numerous local minima. We show that a solution to this problem consists to separate the variability sources. We build a pool of specialized AAMs. Each AAM is trained over multiple identities, all shown under the same pose and expression. We then retain the AAM that shows the smallest residual error when fitted to the input image. The fitting obtained in this manner is very accurate on unseen faces. The ultimate goal is to automatically train a person-specific AAM. In addition, the pool of specialized AAMs allows us to recognize the face pose and expression at each frame of the video with good performances.

Some amateur telescope makers build instruments that, while looking crude, are wholly suited to the purpose they are designed for. Others may strive for a more aesthetic look with high levels of mechanical “finish”.

[...] Alternative materials are available such as steel, copper, and tungsten, but alternatives are universally less effective and/or more expensive.

Laws and regulations relating to armor-piercing ammunition expressly prohibit the use of brass, bronze, steel, tungsten, and nearly every metallic alternative in any bullet that can be shot by a handgun, which at this time is nearly every caliber smaller than 50BMG (including the popular [...]223 Remington, [...]308 Winchester and [...]30-06 <b>to</b> <b>name</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few). Some lead-based bullets are resistant to fragmentation, offering hunters the ability to clean game animals with negligible risk of including lead fragments in prepared meat.
