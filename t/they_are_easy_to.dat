5|$|The glass forms include {{borosilicate}} {{glasses and}} phosphate glasses. Borosilicate nuclear waste glasses are used on an industrial scale to immobilize high level radioactive waste {{in many countries}} which are producers of nuclear energy or have nuclear weaponry. The glass waste forms {{have the advantage of}} being able to accommodate a wide variety of waste-stream compositions, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> scale up to industrial processing, and they are stable against thermal, radiative, and chemical perturbations. These glasses function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass-forming elements. Phosphate glasses while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution rates than borosilicate glasses, which make them a more favorable option. However, no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions. Both glasses have to be processed at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile radiotoxic elements.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there was}} initial {{evidence}} of mesencephalic dopamine-producing cell transplants being beneficial, the best constructed studies {{up to date}} indicate that cell transplants have no effect.

25|$|There are {{a variety}} of Bioreactors {{designed}} for 3D cell cultures. There are small plastic cylindrical chambers, as well as glass chambers, with regulated internal humidity and moisture specifically engineered for the purpose of growing cells in three dimensions. The bioreactor uses bioactive synthetic materials such as polyethylene terephthalate membranes to surround the spheroid cells in an environment that maintains high levels of nutrients. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> open and close, so that cell spheroids can be removed for testing, yet the chamber is able to maintain 100% humidity throughout.

25|$|If {{the route}} of the dive is {{constrained}} or can be reliably planned, cylinders for bailout of decompression gas can be dropped along the route at the points where they will be needed on the return or ascent. The cylinders are usually clipped to a distance line or shot line, to ensure that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> find and unlikely to get lost. These cylinders would typically contain a gas mixture close to optimal for the sector of the dive in which they are intended to be used. This procedure is also known as staging, and the cylinders then known as stage cylinders, but the term stage cylinder has become generic for any cylinder carried at the diver's side in addition to the bottom gas.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> {{keep and}} breed, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans {{have long been}} the most intensively studied metazoan model organisms, and {{were among the first}} life-forms to be genetically sequenced. This was facilitated by the severely reduced state of their genomes, but as many genes, introns, and linkages lost, these ecdysozoans can teach us little about the origins of animals in general. The extent of this type of evolution within the superphylum will be revealed by the crustacean, annelid, and molluscan genome projects currently in progress. Analysis of the starlet sea anemone genome has emphasized the importance of sponges, placozoans, and choanoflagellates, also being sequenced, in explaining the arrival of 1500 ancestral genes unique to the Eumetazoa. An analysis of the homoscleromorph sponge Oscarella carmela also suggests that the last common ancestor of sponges and the eumetazoan animals was more complex than previously assumed. Other model organisms belonging to the animal kingdom include the house mouse (Mus musculus), laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio).|$|E

25|$|A poll tax, {{also called}} {{a per capita}} tax, or {{capitation}} tax, is a tax that levies a set amount per individual. It {{is an example of}} the concept of fixed tax. One of the earliest taxes mentioned in the Bible of a half-shekel per annum from each adult Jew (Ex. 30:11â€“16) was a form of poll tax. Poll taxes are administratively cheap because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> compute and collect and difficult to cheat. Economists have considered poll taxes economically efficient because people are presumed to be in fixed supply and poll taxes therefore do not lead to economic distortions. However, poll taxes are very unpopular because poorer people pay a higher proportion of their income than richer people. In addition, the supply of people is in fact not fixed over time: on average, couples will choose to have fewer children if a poll tax is imposed. The introduction of a poll tax in medieval England was the primary cause of the 1381 Peasants' Revolt. Scotland was the first to be used to test the new poll tax in 1989 with England and Wales in 1990. The change from a progressive local taxation based on property values to a single-rate form of taxation regardless of ability to pay (the Community Charge, but more popularly referred to as the Poll Tax), led to widespread refusal to pay and to incidents of civil unrest, known colloquially as the 'Poll Tax Riots'.|$|E
500|$|Coupled lines (figures 3(c-e)) {{can also}} be used as filter elements; like stubs, they can act as {{resonators}} and likewise be terminated short-circuit or open-circuit. Coupled lines tend to be preferred in planar technologies, where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> implement, whereas stubs tend to be preferred elsewhere. Implementing a true open circuit in planar technology is not feasible because of the dielectric effect of the substrate which will always ensure that the equivalent circuit contains a shunt capacitance. [...] Despite this, open circuits are often used in planar formats in preference to short circuits because they are easier to implement. [...] Numerous element types can be classified as coupled lines and a selection of the more common ones is shown in the figures.|$|E
500|$|Both {{synchronously}} tuned and stagger-tuned schemes have {{a number}} of advantages over schemes that place all the tuning components in a single aggregated filter circuit separate from the amplifier such as ladder networks or coupled resonators. [...] One advantage is that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> tune. [...] Each resonator is buffered from the others by the amplifier stages so have little effect on each other. [...] The resonators in aggregated circuits, on the other hand, will all interact with each other, particularly their nearest neighbours. [...] Another advantage is that the components need not be close to ideal. [...] Every LC resonator is directly working into a resistor which lowers the Q anyway so any losses in the L and C components can be absorbed into this resistor in the design. [...] Aggregated designs usually require high Q resonators. [...] Also, stagger-tuned circuits have resonator components with values that are quite close to each other and in synchronously tuned circuits they can be identical. [...] The spread of component values is thus less in stagger-tuned circuits than in aggregated circuits.|$|E

5|$|For {{owners of}} 33rpm LPs and 45singles, loud and deep bass was {{limited by the}} ability of the {{phonograph}} record stylus to track the groove. Some hi-fi aficionados solved the problem by using reel-to-reel tape players which were capable of delivering accurate, naturally deep bass from acoustic sources, or synthetic bass not found in nature.

500|$|Despite being poor pets {{that are}} {{difficult}} to care for, with a dangerous toxic bite and a sleep cycle opposite to that of humans, a large number of slow lorises are traded as pets, both locally and internationally. Although it is illegal to import slow lorises for commercial sale, they are popular exotic pets in Japan, the United States, and Europe. This is mainly because of their [...] "cute" [...] appearance, popularized in highly viewed YouTube videos, which {{is due in part to}} their large eyes, adaptations to a nocturnal lifestyle. Hundreds of slow lorises have been confiscated at airports, but because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> hide, these numbers are likely to be only a small fraction of the total number being trafficked. Traders cut or pull the teeth of slow lorises to make them appear to be an appropriate pet for small children, but this practice often leads to extreme blood loss, infection, and death. Slow lorises lacking their teeth would be unable to fend for themselves and therefore are not reintroduced into the wild. Most captive lorises in the pet trade also receive improper care and die from poor nutrition, stress, or infection. Despite this, demand has risen, and slow lorises are no longer captured opportunistically, but are now hunted on a commercial scale using flashlights, from which the animals do not flee.|$|E
