5|$|Conducive {{atmospheric}} conditions around Nanmadol on November29 {{led to the}} development of a central dense overcast, followed shortly <b>thereafter</b> by the formation of an eye. Nanmadol was upgraded to severe tropical storm intensity at 0000UTC on November30 and became a typhoon twelve hours later, tracking near Satawal, Woleai, and Yap State during this intensification phase. Following the upgrade to typhoon status, intensification briefly slowed but continued soon <b>thereafter.</b> At 0600UTC on December1, Nanmadol reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935mbar (hPa; 27.61inHg), still east of the Philippines. The typhoon maintained this strength for roughly twelve hours before slightly weakening as it neared Luzon.

5|$|Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Megh is {{regarded}} as the worst tropical cyclone to ever strike the Yemeni island of Socotra, causing additional destruction there after Cyclone Chapala hit the same island. Megh formed on November5, 2015, in the eastern Arabian Sea, and followed a path similar to Chapala. After moving northward, the cyclone turned to the west, and fueled by warm water temperatures, it quickly intensified. On November7, the storm developed an eye in the center and began to rapidly intensify into a mature cyclone. By the next day, the India Meteorological Department estimated peak 3minute sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph), and the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated 1minute winds of 205km/h (125mph). Shortly <b>thereafter,</b> the cyclone brushed the northern coast of Socotra. The storm steadily weakened <b>thereafter,</b> especially after it skirted the northern Somalia coast. After entering the Gulf of Aden, Megh turned to the west-northwest and struck southwestern Yemen on 10November as a deep depression, dissipating shortly <b>thereafter.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Uleki, also {{referred}} as Typhoon Uleki, was a long-lived tropical cyclone in August–September 1988 that had minimal effects on land. Originating from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone in late-August, Uleki {{was identified as}} a tropical depression well to the southeast of Hawaii on August28. Steady organization ensued as it moved west, becoming a tropical storm on August30 and a hurricane on August31. Rapid intensification took place <b>thereafter</b> and the storm reached its peak intensity on September2 as a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Hurricane Hunters investigating the cyclone found peak winds of 125mph (205km/h) and a barometric pressure of 957mbar (hPa; 28.26inHg). <b>Thereafter,</b> Uleki stalled for two days to the southwest of Hawaii, resulting in heavy surf across the state. The dangerous swells killed two people on Oahu.|$|E
