40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of flight tests to determine the lateral and directional stability and control characteristics of the Grumman F 8 F- 1 airplane with three vertical-tail configurations. The data presented herein have no bearing on the performance characteristics of the airplane, which were not measured but which were considered to be exceptionally good. The conclusions reached regarding the lateral and directional stability and control characteristics may be summarized as follows: 1. It was found that the directional stability was poor with the production vertical tail. Addition of a 12 -inch extension to the vertical fin and rudder produced a desirable improvement in directional stability and control characteristics. However, further enlargement of the vertical tail would be required to make the directional stability satisfactory in all respects. 2. There was a tendency for the rudder control force to overbalance at large angles of right sideslip with the modified vertical tails. There was no such tendency with the production tail configuration which included a dorsal fin. It was concluded that the dorsal fin should have been retained on the modified vertical tails. 3. The aileron control characteristics were better than those of many comparable airplanes which have been tested. However, the ailerons did not satisfy the Navy requirements for satisfactory flying qualities with regard to either control forces or rolling effectiveness. 4. The power of the rudder <b>trimming</b> <b>tab</b> proved to be inadequate and the tab should be enlarged and/or be provided with an increased deflection range...|$|E
50|$|However, the investigation, {{released}} in August 2012, {{found that the}} probable cause of the crash were reused single-use locknuts in the left elevator <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> system that loosened. This led to a fatigue crack in an attachment screw and allowed the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> to flutter. This flutter caused the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> link assembly to fail which led to loss of control of the aircraft. Untested and undocumented modifications to the airplane contributed to the accident. Particularly, the right <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> had been fixed in place. Had both <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> been operational, {{the loss of the}} left <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> alone may not have caused loss of control. When the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> failed, Leeward was exposed to 17Gs which quickly incapacitated him and likely rendered him unconscious.|$|R
50|$|TrimTabs {{takes its}} name from the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> that lies deep within an ocean-going ship. The <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> is a {{minuscule}} rudder that runs the length of the main rudder. To change the ship’s direction, one must first turn the <b>trim</b> <b>tab,</b> and then the main rudder follows. TrimTabs contends that just as the movement of a <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> determines the direction of a ship, changes in the <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> of liquidity theory are the key to understanding the stock market’s direction.|$|R

50|$|<b>Trim</b> <b>tabs</b> {{are small}} movable {{sections}} resembling scaled down ailerons located {{at or near}} the trailing edge of the aileron. On most propeller powered aircraft, the rotation of the propeller(s) induces a counteracting roll movement due to Newton's third law of motion, in that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. To relieve the pilot of having to provide continuous pressure on the stick in one direction (which causes fatigue) <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> are provided to adjust or trim out the pressure needed against any unwanted movement. The tab itself is deflected in relation to the aileron, causing the aileron to move in the opposite direction. <b>Trim</b> <b>tabs</b> come in two forms, adjustable and fixed. A fixed <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> is manually bent to the required amount of deflection, while the adjustable <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> can be controlled from within the cockpit so that different power settings or flight attitudes can be compensated for. Some large aircraft from the 1950s (including the Canadair Argus) used free floating control surfaces that the pilot controlled only through the deflection of <b>trim</b> <b>tabs,</b> in which case additional tabs were also provided to fine-tune the control to provide straight and level flight.|$|R
40|$|The {{difference}} in dynamic {{pressure in the}} propeller slipstreams as measured by sensors is divided by the freestream dynamic pressure generating a quantity proportional to the differential thrust coefficient. This quantity is used to command an electric trim motor to change the position of <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> thereby retrimming the airplane to the new asymmetric power condition. The change in position of the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> produced by the electric trim motor is summed with the pilot's input to produce the actual <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> position...|$|R
50|$|In the NTSB {{investigation}} report, {{the cause}} was attributed to extreme pitch-up to 14g+ caused {{by the loss of}} the port elevator <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> due to wear in the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> mounts, exacerbated by lock-nuts on the mounting bolts losing their self-locking ability due to use past their normal life.|$|R
2500|$|Changing {{the setting}} of a <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> adjusts the neutral or resting {{position}} of a control surface (such as an elevator or rudder). As the desired position of a control surface changes (corresponding mainly to different speeds), an adjustable <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> will allow the operator to reduce the manual force required to maintain that position—to zero, if used correctly. [...] Thus the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> acts as a servo tab. [...] Because the center of pressure of the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> is further away from the axis of rotation of the control surface than the center of pressure of the control surface, the movement generated by the tab can match the movement generated by the control surface. The position of the control surface on its axis will change until the torque from the control surface and the trim surface balance each other.|$|R

5000|$|The {{engineer}} Buckminster Fuller {{is often}} cited for his use of <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> {{as a metaphor for}} leadership and personal empowerment. In the February 1972 issue of Playboy, Fuller said: Something hit me very hard once, thinking about what one little man could do. Think of the Queen Mary - the whole ship goes by and then comes the rudder. And there's a tiny thing {{at the edge of the}} rudder called a trim tab.It's a miniature rudder. Just moving the little <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> builds a low pressure that pulls the rudder around. Takes almost no effort at all. So I said that the little individual can be a <b>trim</b> <b>tab.</b> Society thinks it's going right by you, that it's left you altogether. But if you're doing dynamic things mentally, the fact is that you can just put your foot out like that and the whole big ship of state is going to go.So I said, call me <b>Trim</b> <b>Tab.</b> Buckminster Fuller ...|$|R
5000|$|In former Trim-Tab servo systems, {{the pivot}} {{movement}} of the servo blade around its vertical axis {{has been carried out}} by a <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> Servo tab, which however costs some force due to the fact, that the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> is moved in the opposite direction to turn the servo blade.The same holds for a <b>trim</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab,</b> which is mounted at a big distance behind the ship's rudder, connected to it at its upper and lower end. This construction is called [...] "The Saye's Rigg". Another version of wind vane self steering on sail boats is known as the vertical axis vane and usually, because of the inferior steering force output compared to Servo Pendulum devices it makes use of a <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> hung off the rudder to control the course of the boat. The vane spins at right angles to the ground and can lock to the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> in any desired position, as the boat falls off the wind the vane will be turned by the wind and will take the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> with it which in turn causes the rudder to move in the opposite direction and thus corrects course. Generally self steering like this, with a <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> can only be used on boats with transom (or aft hung double enders) rudders as the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> needs to be mounted directly to and aft of the rudder to produce the desired effect, and of course has to be controlled even as the rudder swings side to side. This is typically accomplished by use of a slotted bar in which the connection to the vane assembly can slide in as the rudder turns. These self steering systems are generally simpler and are thus easier to set and adjust course as they don't make use of lines controlling the rudder but control it more directly through solid linkages.A related device has been used on some windmills, the fantail, a small windmill mounted at right angles to the main sails which automatically turns the heavy cap and main sails into the wind, (invented in England in 1745). (When the wind is already directly into the main vanes, the fantail remains essentially motionless.) ...|$|R
50|$|When a {{servo tab}} is employed, it is {{moved into the}} {{slipstream}} opposite to the control surface's desired deflection. For example, in order to trim an elevator to hold the nose down, the elevator's <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> will actually rise up into the slipstream. The increased pressure {{on top of the}} <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> surface caused by raising it will then deflect the entire elevator slab down slightly, causing the tail to rise and the aircraft's nose to move down. In the case of an aircraft where deployment of high-lift devices (flaps) would significantly alter the longitudinal trim, a supplementary <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> is arranged to simultaneously deploy with the flaps so that pitch attitude is not markedly changed.|$|R
