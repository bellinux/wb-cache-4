5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> interest, new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory {{of interest is}} therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E
