Karst) was investigatedin a nationwide field experiment across Sweden. In total, 35 Scots pine sites distributed from the south to the north ofSweden and 13 Norway spruce sites located {{in the south and}} central parts of Sweden were investigated. Thinning treatments ranged from unthinned control, to light and moderate repeated thinnings, to a treatmentwhere 60 - 70 % of the basal area was removed in a single thinning. In addition, thinning from above was compared tothinning from below and delayed first thinning was compared to early first thinning. The average measurement period was 31 years for Scots pine and 30 years for Norway spruce. All Scots pine thinning treatments reduced the <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> stemvolume <b>production</b> compared to the unthinned control, whereas only the heaviest thinning treatments, in which a largeproportion of the basal area was removed, reduced the <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> stem volume <b>production</b> for Norway spruce.

40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} variation in ozone production over major source regions in East Asia during the NASA Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific (TRACE-P) measurement campaign in spring 2001 is assessed using a global chemical transport model. There is a strong latitudinal gradient in ozone production in springtime, driven by regional photochemistry, which rapidly diminishes as the season progresses. The great variability in meteorological conditions characteristic of East Asia in springtime leads to large daily variability in regional ozone formation, but we find that it has relatively little impact on the total global production. We note that transport processes effectively modulate and thus stabilize total ozone production through their influence over its location. However, {{the impact on the}} global ozone burden, important for assessing the effects of precursor emissions on tropospheric oxidizing capacity and climate, is sensitive to local meteorology through the effects of location on chemical lifetime. Stagnant, anticyclonic conditions conducive to substantial boundary layer ozone production typically allow little lifting of precursors into the free troposphere where greater ozone production could occur, and the consequent shorter chemical lifetime for ozone leads to relatively small impacts on global ozone. Conversely, cyclonic conditions with heavy cloud cover suppressing regional ozone production are often associated with substantial cloud convection, enhancing subsequent production in the free troposphere where chemical lifetimes are longer, and the impacts on global ozone are correspondingly greater. We find that ozone formation in the boundary layer and free troposphere outside the region of precursor emissions dominates <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>production</b> from these sources in springtime, and that it makes a big contribution to the long range transport of ozone, which is greatest in this season...|$|E
40|$|Injection of low {{salinity}} {{water into}} the reservoir has been observed and tested in laboratories to have increased the oil recovery up {{to a maximum of}} 40 percent. Chemical and physical mechanism that modifies reservoir fluid properties attributes to this recovery which does not occur in conventional waterflooding. Wettability is the key reservoir parameter that has been recognized to have affected the rock-fluid properties such as residual oil saturation,relative permeability and capillary pressure. This alteration can lead to mobilization of stranded oil inside pore spaces. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the effects of low salinity water flooding in a segment of the Frøy field located in the North Sea. The field is located in blocks 25 / 2 and 25 / 5 in the central North Sea. It is approximately 32 km southeast of the Frigg field and 25 km northeast of the Heimdal field. The field was discovered in 1987 by drilling well 25 / 5 - 1,which found a 76 -m thick oil-bearing Brent sequence. Production started in 1995 and stopped in 2001 due to production related problems and oil price decline. A <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>production</b> of 5. 9 MSm 3 of oil and 1. 7 Gm 3 of gas was reported produced during this period. The field currently operated by Det Norske and with Premier oil as a stakeholder is planned to be reactivated. Using Eclipse 100 as the reservoir simulator, the concept of wettability alteration has been applied to affect the local contact angle by changing the brine composition. This altered the distribution of fluids in the reservoir which in turn affected the relative permeability. Relative permeability functions were expressed by Corey functions. Corey parameters were assumed to be dependent on water salinity. The result showed that there is a 15 % increase inoil recovery. In this study the simulation analysis has been limited to a segment in there servoir to limit the simulation time. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the linkages between livestock and crop farming activities {{and provides a}} comparative analysis of the profitability of different livestock activities in the highlands of Ankara. The data was collected from 52 sample farms in the Nallıhan, Aya¸s, Güdül and Beypazarı districts of Ankara {{by way of a}} questionnaire, where the farms have, on average, 20. 7 ha of land and are thus regarded as small family farms. Insufficient irrigated land and working capital, weak market relations and the pressure of high population brings about a requirement to strengthen crop-livestock interaction. Production on the farms is generally carried out in extensive conditions, with goat, sheep and cattle husbandry in addition to crop production. Crop production makes up for 20. 8 % of the <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>production</b> value on the farms. Of this figure, the entire yields of wheat, barley, pulses, straw and fodder crops are used for own consumption by the households, along with 74 % of the wheat and 77 % of the barley produced. The research results indicate that the current management systems may be defined as mixed farms in terms of crop–livestock linkages. The average total income of the households surveyed is 9, 412. 0 USD, of which 63. 4 % comes from farming activities. Every 1 USD invested in animal husbandry provides an income of 1. 12 USD from dairy cattle breeding, 1. 13 USD from Angora goat breeding, 1. 16 USD from sheep breeding and 1. 27 USD from ordinary goat breeding. It has been found that ordinary goat breeding, which provides the greatest relative profitability for the farms, offers many advantages, and that the transition from Angora goat breeding to ordinary goat breeding through the breeding of ordinary male goats into the Angora herd has occurred in recent years. The results of the survey indicate that supporting crop production with animal husbandry is considered a requirement in order to maintain economic and social sustainability in the farms and to support rural development...|$|E

This diet shift – showing redundancy among phytoplankton species – allowed heterotrophs to maintain their functions in the contaminated microcosms. On an ecosystem level, <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> primary <b>production</b> was up to hundred times lower in the treated microcosms but the uptake of dissolved organic carbon by bacteria and mixotrophs was less sensitive.

The public {{electricity supply}} consumed 124 mtce and contributed about 30 % of the CO$_{ 2 }$ -emissions from the entire energy use (220 mill. t CO$_{ 2 }$ out of 730 mill. t CO$_{ 2 }$). Among several basic options to reduce CO$_{ 2 }$-emissions in the electricity supply activities only the options "increased efficiency" and "switches to other energy sources" are currently pursued in the FRG. Fuel switches (fossil to fossil) are strongly constrained by political reasons. The electricity supply is dominated by thermal power plants : Only 7 GW out of 102 GW total capacity and 20 TWh out of 430 TWh <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>production</b> are nonthermal. Nuclear power, hard coal, lignite, renewables (mainly hydro), gares and oil provided 34 %, 31 %, 18 %, 6 %, 8 % and 3 % respectively of the produced electricity. Among the regenerative options only hydro and waste incineration contribute noticeably : 6. 7 GW and 0. 5 GW as of December 1988. The time horizon for the perspectives is the decade 2000 to 2010 : For the nuclear sector (22. 3 GW, 21 LWR) no further net expansion is expected. The German nuclear industry is now oriented to cooperation within the EC and to exports (advanced LWR, HTGCR). The development of novel fossil fired power plants is (neariy) entirely focused an coal and lignite based concepts (integrated gasification combined cycle : IGCC, and combined cycle with pressurized fluidized bed combustion : PFBC-CC and in an early development status the pressurized coal dust fired combined cycle : PCDF-CC). Currently one experimental combined cycle with natural gas fired gas turbine, 2 pilot PFBC-CC stations and 6 pilot IGCC-CC-stations (2 with PFB, 3 with entrained flow, 1 with malten iron bath) are operative.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} {{the effects of the}} meteorological variability on the <b>gross</b> primary <b>production</b> in the Ligurian Sea (NW Mediterranean Sea), a coupling between a hydrodynamic model and a biological one is realized. The one-dimensional version of the GHER hydrodynamic model includes heat and momentum exchanges at the air-sea interface. It is coupled with a simple food-web model from the LEPM. A simulation performed with real meteorological data for the year 1985 reproduces reasonably the seasonal phytoplanktonic dynamics and the distribution between diatoms and flagellates. From this simulation, an annual <b>gross</b> primary <b>production</b> integrated over 200 m of 46. 4 g C m - 2 year - 1 is computed which is representative of an oligotrophic environment. In order {{to estimate the}} relative effect on the <b>gross</b> primary <b>production</b> of the meteorological variability {{on the one hand and}} of the initial conditions on the other hand, several runs have been performed for the year 1985 with different conditions of light, wind intensity and nitrate initial quantity. The first simulations are performed with daily and monthly mean solar radiation and wind intensity. An averaging of wind intensity yields a decrease in the <b>gross</b> primary <b>production</b> and leads to unrealistic phytoplankton dynamics. It seems then necessary to take into account the 3 -hourly variability of the wind intensity in order to simulate the phytoplankton dynamics with relatively good accuracy. On the other hand, an averaging of the solar radiation leads to an increase in the <b>gross</b> primary <b>production.</b> The following simulations are performed with an increase (decrease) in the solar radiation, the wind intensity or the nitrate initial quantity which are representative of the variability observed in a 5 -year set of meteorological and hydrobiological data (1984 - 1988). An increase in the solar radiation is found to reduce the <b>gross</b> primary <b>production,</b> while an increase in the initial nitrate quantity or the wind intensity leads to a higher <b>gross</b> primary <b>production,</b> and the reverse. In the case of variations of the solar radiation (± 2 %), the simulations give an annual <b>gross</b> primary <b>production</b> integrated over 200 m included between 44. 8 and 46. 7 g C m - 2 year - 1, representing a variability of 4 %. With the variations of the surface wind intensity (± 10 %), the runs carry to an annual <b>gross</b> primary <b>production</b> integrated over 200 m from 34. 1 to 59. 1 g C m - 2 year - 1, representing a variability of 54 %. The variations of the initial nitrate concentration (± 50 %) lead to an annual <b>gross</b> primary <b>production</b> integrated over 200 m between 20. 7 and 69. 8 g C m - 2 year - 1 which represents a variability of 108 %.

40|$|Abstract The carbon {{exchange}} of the Wadden Sea Salt marsh near the Lutjewad Weather station is investigated {{during a period}} of 7 weeks. Three vegetation species are studied: Elymus Athericus, Festuca Rubra and Spartina Towndensii. The average carbon sequestration for the 25 th and the 26 th of May is estimated on 14 μmol m- 2 s- 1 for Elymus Athericus and on 4 μmol m- 2 s- 1 for all species. This high difference is caused because the value of 14 μmol m- 2 s- 1 is measured on one position, where the circumstances were optimal. Elymus and Festuca have corresponding GPP. However, the respiration rate for Fesuta Rubra is lower. Spartina was only just starting its growing season, so the GPP was much lower than that of the other two species. Besides solar irradiance, temperature is found to be a significant factor for the <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> primary <b>production</b> (GPP). Tidal factors may also influence GGP.

Probing the potential for improvement, we investigate the cases of four German cash crop farms over the last six years. The formal planning approach includes a systematic time series analysis of farmspecific single gross margins and a stochastic optimization model. In order to avoid solutions that simply exceed the farmer's risk tolerance, the apparently accepted variance of the observed program's <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> margin which represents an observable reflection of the individual farmer's risk attitude is used as an upper bound in the optimization. For each of the 24 planning occasions, the formal model is used in a quasi ex-ante approach that provides optimized alternative programs. The <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> margins that could have been realized if the formally optimized programs had been implemented are then ex-post compared to those that were actually realized. We find that the farmers could have increased their <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> margins significantly if - instead of using simple routines and rules of thumb - they had used the more sophisticated formal planning model. However, we also find that the superiority of formalized planning approaches depends on the quality of statistical analysis and the resulting forecasting model. Using our approach for practical decision support implies that farmers first specify their "own" production programs without the formal planning aid.

We compared gross FAA dynamics with gross N mineralization in a Dutch heathland soil using a 15 N tracing technique. A special focus was made on the effects of climate change factors warming and drought, followed by rewetting. Our aims were to (1) compare FAA mineralization (NH 4 + production from FAAs) with gross N mineralization, (2) assess <b>gross</b> FAA <b>production</b> rate (depolymerization) and turnover time relative to gross N mineralization rate, and (3) assess the effects of a 14 years of warming and drought treatment on these rates. The turnover of FAA in the soil was ca. 3 h, which is almost 2 orders of magnitude faster than that of NH 4 + (i. e. ca. 4 days). This suggests that FAA is an extensively used resource by soil microorganisms. In control soil (i. e. no climatic treatment), the gross N mineralization rate (10 ± 2. 9 μg N g − 1 day − 1) was 8 times smaller than the <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> FAA <b>production</b> rate of five AAs (alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline: 127. 4 to 25. 0 μg N g − 1 day − 1). Gross FAA mineralization (3. 4 ± 0. 2 μg N g − 1 day − 1) contributed 34 % to the gross N mineralization rate and is therefore an important component of N mineralization. In the drought treatment, a 6 – 29 % reduction in annual precipitation caused a decrease of <b>gross</b> FAA <b>production</b> by 65 % and of gross FAA mineralization by 41 % compared to control. On the other hand, gross N mineralization was unaffected by drought, indicating an increased mineralization of other soil {{organic nitrogen}} (SON) components.

Aims: To compare the full carbon cycle for two 1 -ha forest plots that straddle the ecotone between humid forest and dry forest in Amazonia, ca. 100 km from Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Methods: 2. 5 years of measurements {{of the components of}} net primary production (NPP) and autotrophic respiration were collected. Results: Total NPP was 15. 5 +/- 0. 89 Mg C ha(- 1) year(- 1) at the humid site and 11. 27 +/- 0. 68 Mg C ha(- 1) year(- 1) at the dry site; a <b>total</b> <b>Gross</b> Primary <b>Production</b> (GPP) of 34. 14 +/- 2. 92 Mg C ha(- 1) year(- 1) and 26. 88 +/- 2. 70 Mg C ha(- 1) year(- 1) at the two sites. Carbon use efficiency for both sites was higher than reported for other Amazonian forests (0. 45 +/- 0. 05 and 0. 42 +/- 0. 05). Conclusions: Drier soil conditions selected for the dry deciduous tree species which had higher leaf photosynthesis and total GPP. NPP allocation patterns were similar at the two sites, suggesting that in terms of carbon allocation, the dry {{forests of the}} southern Amazonia behave as a scaled-down version of wetter humid forests...|$|R
40|$|There are few {{detailed}} carbon (C) {{budgets of}} mangrove forests, yet {{these are important}} for understanding C sequestration in mangrove forests, how they support the productivity of the coast and their vulnerability to environmental change. Here, we develop C budgets for mangroves on the islands of Twin Cays, Belize. We consider seaward fringing forests and interior scrub forests that have been fertilized with phosphorus (P), which severely limits growth of trees in the scrub forests. We found that respiration of the aboveground biomass accounted for 60 %– 80 % of the fixed C and that respiration of the canopy and aboveground roots were important components of respiration. Soil respiration accounted for only 7 %– 11 % of <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> primary <b>production</b> (GPP) while burial of C in soils was ~ 4 % of GPP. Respiration by roots can account {{for the majority of}} soil respiration in fringing forests, while microbial processes may account 80 % of respiration in scrub forests. Fertilization of scrub forests with P enhanced GPP but the proportion of C buried declined to ~ 2 % of GPP. Net ecosystem production was 17 %– 27 % of GPP similar to that reported for other mangrove forests. Carbon isotope signatures of adjacent seagrass suggest that dissolved C from mangroves is exported into the adjacent ecosystems. Our data indicate that C budgets can vary among mangrove forest types and with nutrient enrichment and that low productivity mangroves provide a disproportionate share of exported C...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to gain a better {{understanding}} of the land cover distributions, land cover changes and the differences in ecosystem service provisions resulting from distinctive indicators based on various CORINE land cover classes. By analyzing the land cover dynamics and the annual <b>total</b> <b>Gross</b> Primary <b>Production</b> (GPP) and Net Primary Production (NPP), Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), Carbon Storage (CS), and a qualitative indicator derived from the ecosystem service matrix method (GCR), this study measures the land cover distributions. The land-cover-based global climate regulation potential is assessed to improve global climate regulation. This study uses spatial and statistical analysis tools referring to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the statistical package R and the software of SPSS are used to estimate the land cover and ecosystem services dynamics in Schleswig-Holstein. The study has found that “non-irrigated arable land” and “pastures” are the dominating land cover classes in Schleswig-Holstein, and the significant land cover changes are among them. “Non-irrigated arable land” and “pastures” have higher annual total stored GPP and NPP values than the other land cover classes. Geest has the largest annual total stored GPP and NPP even though the annual total GPP and NPP are less than the annual total GPP and NPP in Marsch. Simultaneously, Dithmarschen and Rendsburg-Eckernförde hold larger annual total stored GPP and NPP amounts than the other districts. The outcome of the comparison of qualitative and quantitative indicators of the global climate regulation service, the annual total GPP, the annual total NPP, SOC, Carbon Stocks and GCR is that all of them show significant correlations. The interrelations among the different indicators, the annual total GPP, the annual total NPP, and the statistical data of average harvest, the harvests of grain, green corn, root crops and winter rape evaluated based on districts also correlate significantly...|$|R
