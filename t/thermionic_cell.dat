40|$|Common solar {{technologies}} are either photovoltaic/thermophotovoltaic, or use indirect methods of electricity generation such as {{boiling water for}} a steam turbine. Thermionic energy conversion based on the emission of electrons from a hot cathode into vacuum and their collection by an anode is also a promising route. However, thermionic solar conversion is extremely challenging as the sunlight intensity is too low for heating a conventional cathode to thermionic emission temperatures in a practical manner. Therefore, compared to other technologies, little {{has been done in}} this area, and the devices have been mainly limited to large experimental apparatus investigated for space power applications. Based on a recently observed “Heat Trap” effect in carbon nanotube arrays, allowing their efficient heating with low-power light, we report the first compact <b>thermionic</b> solar <b>cell.</b> Even using a simple off-the-shelf focusing lens, the device delivered over 1 V across a load.

It is found that space charge effects become important for the PETSC when the gap width between two electrodes is a few microns or more. At these distances, near-field heat transfer effects are negligible because the gaps are larger than the characteristic wavelength of the thermal radiation, as given by Wien's displacement law. The effects of the energy band gap, electron affinity and temperature of the cathode on the efficiency of the PETSC are analyzed in detail. The maximum efficiency of the PETSC limited by the space charge is calculated under different constraint conditions. Although the maximum efficiency obtained here is much smaller than that calculated theoretically by Schwede et al., Nature Materials 9 (2010) 762, it may be higher than those of traditional solar <b>cells</b> and <b>thermionic</b> devices as long as the gap width of two electrodes is rationally designed.

40|$|National Natural Science Foundation [11175148]; 973 Program, People's Republic of China [2012 CB 619301]A photon-enhanced <b>thermionic</b> solar <b>cell</b> (PETSC) is a {{new type}} of solar energy {{conversion}} device that simultaneously uses light and heat from the sun. In this paper, a PETSC model is briefly described, which includes the thermal radiation between the cathode and the anode and the heat losses from the two electrode plates to the environment. Analytic expressions are derived for the power output and overall efficiency of the PETSC. Energy balance equations are used to calculate the operating temperatures of the cathode and anode electrodes for given values of the band gap energy and electron affinity of the cathode material. The performance characteristics of the PETSC are determined by numerical calculation. The maximum efficiency of the PETSC is clearly larger than that of traditional thermionic devices or solar cells. The optimal values of the band gap energy and electron affinity of the cathode material at the maximum efficiency are determined, and consequently, the operating temperatures of the cathode and anode electrodes can be optimally designed. The results obtained in this study may provide guidance for the appropriate selection of cathode materials and the optimum design of practical PETSC devices. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.

40|$|As {{part of the}} 22. 033 / 22. 33 Nuclear Systems Design project, {{this group}} {{designed}} a 100 kW[subscript e] Martian/Lunar surface reactor system to work for 5 EFPY in support of extraterrestrial human exploration efforts. The reactor design was optimized over the following criteria: small mass and size, controllability, launchability/accident safety, and high reliability. The Martian Surface Reactor was comprised of four main systems: the core, power conversion system, radiator and shielding. The core produces 1. 2 MW[subscript th] and operates in a fast spectrum. Li heat pipes cool the core and couple to the power conversion system. The heat pipes compliment the chosen pintype fuel geometry arranged in a tri-cusp configuration. The reactor fuel is UN (33. 1 w/o enriched), the cladding and structural materials in core are Re, and a Hf vessel encases the core. The reflector is Zr[subscript 3]Si[subscript 2], chosen for its high albedo. Control is achieved by rotating drums, using a TaB[subscript 2] shutter material. Under {{a wide range of}} postulated accident scenarios, this core remains sub-critical and poses minimal environmental hazards. The power conversion system consists of three parts: a power conversion unit, a transmission system and a heat exchanger. The power conversion unit is a series of cesium <b>thermionic</b> <b>cells,</b> each one wrapped around a core heat pipe. The thermionic emitter is Re at 1800 K, and the collector is molybdenum at 950 K. These units, operating at 10 [superscript +]% efficiency, produce 125 kW[subscript e] DC and transmit 100 kW[subscript e] AC. The power transmission system includes 25 separate DC-to-AC converters, transformers to step up the transmission voltage, and 25 km of 22 gauge copper wire for actual electricity transmission. The remaining 900 kWth then gets transmitted to the heat pipes of the radiator via an annular heat pipe heat exchanger that fits over the thermionics. This power conversion system was designed with much redundancy and high safety margins; the highest percent power loss due to a single point failure is 4 %. The radiator is a series of potassium heat pipes with carbon-carbon fins attached. For each core heat pipe there is one radiator heat pipe. The series of heat pipe/fin combinations form a conical shell around the reactor. There is only a 10 degree temperature drop between the heat exchanger and radiator surface, making the radiating temperature 940 K. In the radiator, the maximum cooling loss due to a single point failure is less than 1 %. The shielding system is a bi-layer shadow shield that covers an 80 º arc of the core. The inner layer of the shield is a boron carbide neutron shield; the outer layer is a tungsten gamma shield. The tungsten shield is coated with SiC to prevent oxidation in the Martian atmosphere. At a distance of 11 meters from the reactor, on the shielded side, the radiation dose falls to an acceptable 2 mrem/hr; on the unshielded side, an exclusion zone extends to 14 m from the core. The shield is movable to protect crew no matter the initial orientation of the core. When combined together, the four systems comprise the MSR. The system is roughly conical, 4. 8 m in diameter and 3 m tall. The total mass of the reactor is 6. 5 MT...|$|R
