5|$|Between 1835 and 1837, the {{zoologist}} Edward Blyth {{worked on}} the area of variation, artificial selection, and how a similar process occurs in nature. Darwin acknowledged Blyth's ideas in the first chapter on variation of On <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species.</b>|$|E
5|$|From Aristotle until Darwin, {{the natural}} world was {{predominantly}} considered static and unchanging. Prior to <b>The</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species,</b> there was little appreciation or understanding of the dynamic and reciprocal relations between organisms, their adaptations, and the environment. An exception is the 1789 publication Natural History of Selborne by Gilbert White (1720–1793), considered {{by some to be}} one of the earliest texts on ecology. While Charles Darwin is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution, he was one of the founders of soil ecology, and he made note of the first ecological experiment in <b>The</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species.</b> Evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences.|$|E
5|$|He also {{continued}} his critical {{work and in}} 1860 reviewed On <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species</b> by Charles Darwin. He {{was one of the}} few contemporary critics to be sympathetic to Darwin, although he was reluctant to show he was convinced of the theories.|$|E

5|$|In {{his book}} Genetics and <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species</b> (1937), Theodosius Dobzhansky {{established}} {{the idea that}} mutation, once seen as a rival to selection, actually supplied the raw material for natural selection by creating genetic diversity.|$|E
5|$|When Darwin {{received}} Alfred Russel Wallace's {{paper that}} described natural selection, Hooker and Charles Lyell {{arranged for a}} joint reading of papers by Darwin and Wallace to the Linnean Society on July1, 1858. Since Darwin had nothing prepared, the reading included excerpts from his 1844 Essay and from a letter he had sent to Asa Gray in July 1857 outlining his theory on <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>species.</b> By that time, Darwin had begun writing his book On <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species.</b> The correspondence with Gray was thus a key piece of evidence in establishing Darwin's intellectual priority {{with respect to the}} theory of evolution by natural selection. Neither Darwin nor Wallace attended the meeting. The papers were published by the society as On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection. By summer 1859 it was obvious to Gray and others working with Darwin that On <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species</b> would be a ground-breaking book.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{quoted a}} passage from Aristotle's Physics II 8 in <b>The</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species,</b> which entertains the {{possibility}} of a selection process following the random combination of body parts. However, Aristotle immediately rejected the possibility, and he was in any case discussing ontogeny, the Empedoclean coming into being of an individual from component parts, not phylogeny and natural selection.|$|E
50|$|Classic {{biogeography}} {{has been}} expanded {{by the development}} of molecular systematics, creating a new discipline known as phylogeography. This development allowed scientists to test theories about <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> and dispersal <b>of</b> populations, such as island endemics. For example, while classic biogeographers were able to speculate about <b>the</b> <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> in <b>the</b> Hawaiian Islands, phylogeography allows them to test theories of relatedness between these populations and putative source populations in Asia and North America.|$|R

5|$|Darwin's {{work has}} {{continued}} to be celebrated by numerous publications and events. The Linnean Society of London has commemorated Darwin's achievements by the award of the Darwin–Wallace Medal since 1908. Darwin Day has become an annual celebration, and in 2009 worldwide events were arranged for the bicentenary of Darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of On <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, {{particularly}} {{after the publication}} of On <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species</b> in 1859, the idea that life had evolved was an active source of academic debate centred on the philosophical, social and religious implications of evolution. Today, the modern evolutionary synthesis is accepted by a vast majority of scientists. However, evolution remains a contentious concept for some theists.|$|E
5|$|This naturalistic {{explanation}} fitted {{well with}} the recent account of evolution by Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin, as outlined in his famous 1859 book <b>The</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species.</b> Because this Darwinian explanation required no supernatural forces, it met with considerable criticism from anti-evolutionists, both in academic circles and in the broader social realm.|$|E
2500|$|... most Christians {{around the}} world {{accepted}} evolution as the most likely explanation for <b>the</b> <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>species,</b> and did not take a literal view of the Genesis creation myth. The United States is an exception where belief in religious fundamentalism {{is much more likely}} to affect attitudes towards evolution than it is for believers elsewhere. Political partisanship affecting religious belief may be a factor because political partisanship in the US is highly correlated with fundamentalist thinking, unlike in Europe.|$|R
40|$|Coral reefs exhibit highly {{congruent}} {{patterns of}} biodiversity, with a prominent hotspot in the Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA). Unlike many terrestrial systems, the IAA hotspot exhibits extensive latitudinal and longitudinal biodiversity gradients. Conflicting hypotheses have highlighted {{the importance of}} the area as a centre <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> overlap or accumulation, with the location of endemics being used as the primary criterion for testing these hypotheses, by identifying <b>the</b> presumed geographical <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>species.</b> We evaluate <b>the</b> utility of marine endemics for resolving these hypotheses, and examine recent molecular phylogenetic evidence for coral reef species that has revealed the antiquity of the endemics and the other species that make up this hotspot. These analyses emphasize {{the importance of the}} IAA in the survival rather than <b>the</b> <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>species...</b>|$|R

5|$|By the 1850s, {{whether or}} not species evolved was a subject of intense debate, with {{prominent}} scientists arguing {{both sides of the}} issue. The publication of Charles Darwin's On <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species</b> fundamentally transformed the discussion over biological origins. Darwin argued that his branching version of evolution explained a wealth of facts in biogeography, anatomy, embryology, and other fields of biology. He also provided the first cogent mechanism by which evolutionary change could persist: his theory of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{mentioned}} evolutionary {{interactions between}} flowering plants and insects in On <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species</b> (1859). The term coevolution was coined by Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven in 1964. The theoretical underpinnings of coevolution are now well-developed, and demonstrate that coevolution {{can play an}} important role in driving major evolutionary transitions such as the evolution of sexual reproduction or shifts in ploidy. More recently, it has also been demonstrated that coevolution influences the structure and function of ecological communities as well as the dynamics of infectious disease.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{published}} {{his theory of}} evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species,</b> overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of transmutation of species. By the 1870s, the scientific community {{and much of the}} general public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations and {{it was not until the}} emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper (Bellwood & Meyer, Journal of Biogeography, 2009, 36, 569 – 576), we {{critically}} evaluated {{the utility of}} marine endemics for marking <b>the</b> geographical <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>species.</b> In reply, Briggs (2009) identified two issues that needed clarification: (1) whether endemics are assumed to mark <b>the</b> geographical <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> or areas <b>of</b> exceptionally high rates of origination, and (2) whether our evaluation {{of the role of}} endemics disproves <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> hypothesis. <b>Of</b> these two issues, the first can be clearly resolved by recourse to the original literature that explicitly states that it has been assumed that endemics do indeed mark <b>the</b> probable sites <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>species.</b> <b>The</b> second is equally clear: our evidence does not and can not disprove <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> theory. We suggest, however, that the current data, and endemics in particular, provide limited support for centre <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> theories and that they are more consistent with some centre of accumulation theories. The Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA; Coral Triangle) therefore appears to be an area where species persist, a centre of survival, regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>species...</b>|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} main plot, there are also many sub-plots, such as finding and reactivating EX Korok robots, piecing {{together}} <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>species</b> or each species' history.|$|R

5|$|Darwin's speculations on <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> {{convinced}} him that cross-fertilisation {{played an important role}} in keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural outbreeding through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the cross-pollination of flowers.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} eleven fossils include {{impressions}} of feathers. Because these feathers are of an advanced form (flight feathers), these fossils are {{evidence that the}} evolution of feathers began before the Late Jurassic. The type specimen of Archaeopteryx was discovered just two years after Charles Darwin published On <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species.</b> Archaeopteryx seemed to confirm Darwin's theories and has since become a key piece of evidence for the origin of birds, the transitional fossils debate, and confirmation of evolution.|$|E
5|$|Objections to {{evolution}} {{have been}} raised since evolutionary ideas came to prominence in the 19th century. When Charles Darwin published his 1859 book On <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species,</b> his theory of evolution (the idea that species arose through descent with modification from a single common ancestor in a process driven by natural selection) initially met opposition from scientists with different theories, but eventually came to receive overwhelming acceptance in the scientific community. The observation of evolutionary processes occurring (as well as the modern evolutionary synthesis explaining that evidence) has been uncontroversial among mainstream biologists since the 1940s.|$|E
50|$|A {{cluster of}} genes which {{are close to}} one another at a {{chromosome}} locus are called contiguous. Contiguous gene disorders result from deletions or duplications of a chromosome segment that cause a contiguous gene imbalance.Also, Contiguity refers to the way Taxonomy is ordered and formed after Charles Darwin wrote Theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species</b> in 1859. Before then, scientists used a more strict taxonomy based upon an organism's locomotion and mobility. Now science bases taxonomy on contiguity, tracking changes in an organism's anatomy over eons to show contiguous shaping over time.|$|R
