40|$|Green tea is a {{beverage}} {{that contributes}} to good health. Consumers gain nutritional benefits from the antioxidant propeliies associated with the chemical composition of a green tea infusion. Although, once prepared the quality of tea may deteriorate during storage as the infusion's chemical composition is altered. This research investigated the degradation of some polyphenol catechin compounds in Lipton ® green tea with and without added fmit juice. The analytes of interest ine 1 uded gallic acid, caffeine and some green tea catechins: epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate and epigallocatechin gallate. Lipton ® green tea samples were prepared in triplicate according <b>to</b> <b>package</b> <b>directions,</b> stored for 6 days at 25 °C in a water bath and shaken uncovered at 60 revolutions per minute. The analytes were measured every 24 hours 3 using reverse-phase high perfonnance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with gradient elution and a photodiode array detector. During storage epicatechin gallate and epigallocatechin gallate appeared to be enzymatically hydrolyzed releasing gallic acid, epicatechin and epigallocatechin. Aerobi...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of review: The present review {{provides}} an overview of insect pest species associated with packaged-food products, potential mechanisms leading <b>to</b> infestation of <b>packaged</b> products, and strategies to prevent such infestation. Findings: There are two possible reasons that may explain the presence of insects in packaged products: (1) insects are present in the product before packaging, or (2) insects invaded the product after packaging from already existing openings or from insects creating an entry point. Control strategies include the correct identification of the species found in the packaged product, mechanical or thermal methods for eliminating infestations in raw and processed products, use of repellents or insecticides outside packages, and application of modified or controlled atmospheres inside <b>packages.</b> <b>Directions</b> for future research: Further research is required on the above topics focusing on all stages of food manufacture and distribution for successful prevention of insect presence in packaged products. © 2011 Stewart Postharvest Solutions (UK) Ltd...|$|R
