40|$|For case {{hardening}} steel, {{the relationship between}} microstructure and machinability is investigated. To {{be able to determine}} the influence of morphology, i. e. grain size, phase distribution and interlamellar spacing in pearlite, homogeneous material is required. However, a homogeneous microstructure can only be guaranteed when small material volumes are used. For that reason the Volvo Standard Machinability Test has been applied, as it allows ranking of materials with respect to their machinability by removing only small amounts of material (~ 800 mm of a bar with 50 mm diameter for each material). In addition to what is described in the standard of the test, a number of observations and experiences have been made. In this article the observations in connection with the Volvo Standard Machinability Test are critically discussed. Furthermore, the results of <b>the</b> <b>machinability</b> <b>test</b> of the {{case hardening}} steels are presented...|$|E
40|$|Cutting tools get {{worn out}} due to wear and are ground {{in order to}} use them again. This wear may be due to {{abrasive}} wear, diffusion wear, fatigue wear, adhesive wear. Wear of tool steels leads to shortening of the length, so small that the tool bits are no more usable. These waste and thrown away tool bits were collected which may include steel waste, pig iron, molybdenum iron, chromium iron, vanadium iron, tungsten iron and other waste material. This mixture was melted in induction furnace at temperature about 1600 o C to 1700 o C. After that the casting of the melt was done through the centrifugal route at speeds of 200 rpm and 250 rpm. The cast obtained is in the shape of tool steel cylinder. Then the samples were prepared for the hardness test, machinability test and SEM analysis. The hardness was measured across the radius of the cast cylinder by using Rockwell hardness test machine in C-scale. <b>The</b> <b>machinability</b> <b>test</b> specimens were taken from the outer zone of the cast cylinder and the test was carried out in Lathe by keeping the variables such as rotation speed (420 rpm), feed rate (0. 15 KM), rack angle (10 0) material to be machined (mild steel) and time of machining (5 minutes 40 seconds) constant. The machinability of the centrifugally cast samples were compared with the as-cast samples. SEM micrographs were taken for the outer region of the cast cylinder and a comparative study was made with the as-cast samples. We found that there is an increase in hardness values with the distance from the centre to the outer periphery of the cast samples also the hardness values are higher for speed 250 rpm than 200 rpm.

Para tanto foi utilizado o processo de torneamento, variando a profundidade de corte, a velocidade de corte, o ângulo de posição da ferramenta de corte e utilização e não utilização de fluido de corte. Para este fim, 36 amostras (18 recozidas previamente) foram austemperadas em etapa única nas temperaturas de 300 °C, 360 °C e 420 °C nos tempos de 30 min, 60 min e 90 min. e 16 peças (8 com recozimento prévio) em duas etapas à 245 °C e 300 °C nos respectivos tempos de 5 min e 30 min.. Para austêmpera em etapa única, amostras austemperadas à 300 °C por 30 minutos (sem recozimento prévio) obtiveram melhor usinabilidade, resistência ao impacto e menor dureza. Já, as austemperadas no mesmo tempo e temperatura (com recozimento prévio) obtiveram pior usinabilidade, maior dureza e menor resistência ao impacto. A austêmpera em duas etapas foi realizada em 8 peças que obtiveram melhor usinabilidade e em 8 peças de pior usinabilidade nos testes de austêmpera em única etapa. Estes testes de usinabilidade foram executados com e sem o uso de fluido de corte utilizando-se os ângulos de posição da ferramenta de corte de 90 º e 60 º. Os resultados apontam para melhor usinabilidade às amostras austemperadas pelo processo de duas etapas e que foram previamente recozidas e austemperadas à 300 °C durante 30 minutos, quando usinadas com fluido de corte e ângulo de posição da ferramenta de corte de 60 º.

The samples (18 initially annealed) were heated at 910 °C for 90 minutes for austenitization and cooled in salt bath in one-step at temperatures 300 °C, 360 °C and 420 °C for 30, 60 and 90 minutes. Other 16 samples (8 previously annealed) were austempered in two-step process at 245 oC and 300 oC for 5 and 30 minutes, respectively. The samples were analyzed initially by optical microscopy and mechanical tests (Brinell hardness and Vickers microhardness), and after were machined in an universal lathe for machinability tests. The mechanical lathe was instrumented in relation to active power and cutting time, and the machinability evaluation was made with reference to cutting force, cutting pressure and material removal index criteria. The samples austempered at 300 oC for 30 minutes (with annealing) showed the best machinability, impact resistance and lowest hardness in the one-step process. However, the samples in the same temperature and time (with annealing) showed the worst machinability, highest hardness and lowest impact resistance.

Realizing that clustering of very fine (5 um) graphite particles {{is one of}} the two major problems, a pretreatment process has been developed using aluminum powders to deagglomerate graphite particles. Along with this, a two-stage stirring technique was used to first incorporate and then to distribute uniformly the deagglomerated particles in the melt.

40|$|This paper {{explains}} {{the influence of}} machining parameters such as cutting forces and surface roughness on <b>the</b> <b>machinability</b> of LM 6 / SiCp metal matrix composites at different weight fraction of SiCp. Machining tests were carried out at different cutting speed (i. e., 30, 68 and 103 m/min) and different depth of cuts (i. e., 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 mm) at constant feed rate i. e., 0. 05 mm/rev to study <b>the</b> <b>machinability</b> of as cast composites. It was observed that the depth of cut and the cutting speed at constant feed rate affects the surface roughness and the cutting forces during dry turning operation of cast MMCs. It was also observed that higher weight percentage of SiCp reinforcement imparts a higher surface roughness and needs high cutting forces. This experimental analysis and <b>test</b> results on <b>the</b> <b>machinability</b> of Al/SiC-MMC will provide essential guidelines to the manufacturers...|$|R
40|$|Turning tools come in {{different}} shapes and sizes, geometry, base material and coating, {{according to their}} destination. They are widely used both for obtaining parts and for <b>machinability</b> <b>tests.</b> In this paper a short review about high-speed steel (HSS) turning tools and their coatings is presented. Hard coatings formed on the tool material should be functional depending on the tool final application. Requirements for hard coatings and technological problems for layer formation on the real cutting tool are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{large number}} of <b>machinability</b> <b>tests</b> {{developed}} in <b>the</b> past are limited by their ability to compare materials of different classes, e. g., ferrous vs. non-ferrous metals, and by the extrapolation of test data to machine shop practice. Publication of ASTM E 618, a <b>machinability</b> <b>test</b> that evaluates materials under production-scale conditions using a commercial automatic screw machine, does {{provide the basis for}} making such a comparison and can offer practical information to the machinist. However the ASTM test method has heretofore been applied almost exclusively to steels or to metals of similar classes. A technique was therefore developed whereby ASTM E 618 can be applied to a number of different materials, including brasses, carbon and leaded steels and aluminum alloys. A graphical method of data analysis has also been developed which enables (1) formulation of a universal machinability rating by direct comparison of different materials and (2) prediction of both theoretical and actual production rates for arbitrary screw-machine products based on workpiece dimensions, workpiece material and the type of cutting tool employed. The test method and data analysis are described. Predicted production rates are compared with those experienced by a commercial screwmachine operator...|$|R
40|$|Machining forces, chip formation, surface {{integrity}} and shear and friction angles are important factors to understand <b>the</b> <b>machinability</b> of metal matrix composites (MMCs). However, {{because of the}} complexity of the reinforcement mechanisms of the ceramic particles, a fair assessment of <b>the</b> <b>machinability</b> of MMCs is still a difficult issue. This paper investigates experimentally the effects of reinforcement particles on the machining of MMCs. The major findings are: (1) the surface residual stresses on the machined MMC are compressive; (2) the surface roughness is controlled by feed; (3) particle pull-out influences the roughness when feed is low; (4) particles facilitate chip breaking and affect the generation of residual stresses; and (5) the shear and friction angles depend significantly on feed but are almost independent of speed. These results reveal the roles of the reinforcement particles on <b>the</b> <b>machinability</b> of MMCs and provide a useful guide for a better control of their machining processes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined The {{use of a}} {{polar diagram}} method for {{describing}} and evaluating <b>the</b> <b>machinability</b> of Inconel 718 was explored. Five key parameters of the work material, representing the mechanical and physical properties, which have the strongest influence on its machinability, were employed in the diagrams. These five parameters were integrated into a single polar diagram, used to describe <b>the</b> <b>machinability</b> of Inconel 718. Variations in <b>the</b> <b>machinability</b> of Inconel 718 products or components of a given type produced in different batches were analyzed. Industrial experiments were conducted to test {{the relationship between the}} polar diagram of the work material, its carbon content, and the tool wear of the ceramic cutting tools used in machining it. Work materials of Inconel 718 in which the polar diagrams of machinability were similar in size and shape exhibited very similar behavior during the cutting process. The polar diagram method employed appeared to be useful for selecting suitable cutting data for the machining of new materials...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} examine <b>the</b> <b>machinability</b> of high {{manganese}} steel castings, turning and facing tests with carbide and ceramic tools were performed, and tool wear, cutting resistance and surface roughness were observed; and then, hot machining by electric current was studied with M 10 carbide tool. The main results are as follows : 1) The best of used tools is M 10 carbide tool for cutting the high manganese steel castings, and the optimum cutting speed is 40 ～ 60 m/min. 2) <b>The</b> <b>machinability</b> of <b>the</b> high mangase steel castings : the growth of flank wear is larger than that of groove wear and the tool life is short : the cutting resistance decreases monotonously with cutting speed; the surface roughness is comparatively fine. 3) The tool wear increases with electric current in hot machining of the high manganese steel castings; i. e., this method is inadequate to the improvement of <b>the</b> <b>machinability...</b>|$|R
