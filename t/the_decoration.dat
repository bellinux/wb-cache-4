5|$|<b>The</b> <b>decoration</b> of {{the opening}} few words of each Gospel was lavish. These pages were, in effect, turned into carpet pages. <b>The</b> <b>decoration</b> of these texts is so {{elaborate}} that the text itself is almost illegible. The opening page (folio 29r) of Matthew may stand as an example. (See illustration at left.) The page consists of only two words: Liber generationis ("The book of the generation"). The lib of Liber is turned into a giant monogram which dominates the entire page. The er of Liber is presented as an interlaced ornament within the b of the lib monogram. Generationis is broken into three lines and contained within an elaborate frame in the right lower quadrant of the page. The entire assemblage is contained within an elaborate border.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} was lavishly decorated with colourful Byzantine-style mosaics, cornices, and ceramics. With {{the exception of}} the Corinthian and Doric column capitals, which are of Roman or Byzantine origin, the rest of <b>the</b> <b>decoration</b> was created specifically for and during the church's construction. Vlasto finds a Proto-Bulgarian flavour in the church's interior and a relationship with the art of Persia or Central Asia. Thus, he believes that it is not based on Byzantine examples of that age. Of a contrary opinion is Miyatev, who points out significant similarities between <b>the</b> <b>decoration</b> of the Round Church and that of the Church of the Mother of God (now part of the Fenari Isa Mosque) from 908 in Constantinople. Mavrodinov goes a step further to claim that the architect of the Round Church was directly inspired by ancient examples, citing in particular the rich sculptural decoration.|$|E
5|$|The nearby tomb of Horemheb, (KV57) {{is rarely}} open to visitors. But it has many unique {{features}} and is extensively decorated. <b>The</b> <b>decoration</b> shows {{a transition from}} the pre-Amarna tombs {{to those of the}} 19th dynasty tombs that followed.|$|E

5|$|With these exceptions, most of <b>the</b> <b>decoration</b> and the {{fittings}} of {{the choir}} date from the 19thcentury and are {{in keeping with the}} Gothic Revival promoted by the Oxford Movement and Augustus Welby Pugin.
