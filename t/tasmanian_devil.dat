5|$|As well as passengers, Nairana {{regularly}} carried cargo, including gold bullion, {{and live}} {{animals such as}} horses and cattle between Tasmania and the mainland. A <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>devil</b> being transported to Melbourne Zoo in a wooden crate placed {{in one of the}} ship's four horse stalls escaped by chewing a hole through its box, and was never seen again. In 1934, her code letters were changed to VJGY. Nairana was withdrawn from service in December 1935 {{as a result of a}} ship workers' strike, returning to the Bass Strait run in the new year. As she neared Port Phillip Bay on 12 April 1936, on a clear day with apparently calm seas, she was again struck by a rogue wave and rolled onto her port side before swinging back over to starboard and eventually righting. The impact injured most of her 88 passengers and killed four, including a family of three who disappeared after being swept overboard. Despite this, she proceeded to her berth in the Yarra River, having sustained only minor damage.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, 2012 {{estimates}} {{indicate that}} there are more than 7.2million red foxes with a range extending throughout most of the continental mainland. The species became established in Australia through successive introductions by settlers in 1830s in the British colonies of Van Diemen's Land (as early as 1833) and the Port Phillip District of New South Wales (as early as 1845) for the purpose of the traditional English sport of fox hunting. A permanent fox population was not established on the island of Tasmania and it is widely held that they were outcompeted by the <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>devil.</b> On the mainland, however, the species was successful as an apex predator. It is generally less common in areas where the dingo is more prevalent, however it has, primarily through its burrowing behaviour, achieved niche differentiation with both the feral dog and the feral cat. As such it {{has become one of the}} continent's most invasive species. The red fox has been implicated in the extinction and decline of several native Australian species, particularly those of the family Potoroidae including the desert rat-kangaroo. The spread of red foxes across the southern part of the continent has coincided with the spread of rabbits in Australia and corresponds with declines in the distribution of several medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals, including brush-tailed bettongs, burrowing bettongs, rufous bettongs, bilbys, numbats, bridled nailtail wallabys and quokkas. Most of these species are now limited to areas (such as islands) where red foxes are absent or rare. Local eradication programs exist, although eradication has proven difficult due to the denning behaviour and nocturnal hunting, so the focus is on management with the introduction of state bounties. According to the Tasmanian government, red foxes were introduced to the previously fox-free island of Tasmania in 1999 or 2000, posing a significant threat to native wildlife including the eastern bettong, and an eradication program conducted by the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries and Water has been established.|$|E

40|$|Devil Facial Tumour 1 (DFT 1) {{is one of}} two {{transmissible}} neoplasms of <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>devils</b> (Sarcophilus harrisii) predominantly {{affecting their}} facial regions. DFT 1 's cellular origin is that of Schwann cell lineage where lesions are evident macroscopically late in the disease. Conversely, the pre-clinical timeframe from cellular transmission to appearance of DFT 1 remains uncertain demonstrating the importance of an effective pre-clinical biomarker. We show that ERBB 3, a marker expressed normally by the developing neural crest and Schwann cells, is immunohistohemically expressed by DFT 1, therefore the potential of ERBB 3 as a biomarker was explored. Under the hypothesis that serum ERBB 3 levels may increase as DFT 1 invades local and distant tissues our pilot study determined serum ERBB 3 levels in normal <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>devils</b> and <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>devils</b> with DFT 1. Compared to the baseline serum ERBB 3 levels in unaffected <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>devils,</b> <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>devils</b> with DFT 1 showed significant elevation of serum ERBB 3 levels. Interestingly <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>devils</b> with cutaneous lymphoma (CL) also showed elevation of serum ERBB 3 levels when compared to the baseline serum levels of <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>devils</b> without DFT 1. Thus, elevated serum ERBB 3 levels in otherwise healthy looking devils could predict possible DFT 1 or CL in captive or wild devil populations and would have implications on the management, welfare and survival of <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>devils.</b> ERBB 3 is also a therapeutic target and therefore the potential exists to consider modes of administration that may eradicate DFT 1 from the wild...|$|R

25|$|The {{greatest}} {{population density}} for Aborigines {{developed in the}} southern and eastern regions, the River Murray valley in particular. Aborigines lived and used resources on the continent sustainably, agreeing to cease hunting and gathering at particular times to give populations and resources the chance to replenish. The arrival of Australia's first people nevertheless affected the continent significantly, and, along with climate change, {{may have contributed to}} the extinction of Australia's megafauna. The practice of firestick farming amongst northern Aborigines to increase the abundance of plants that attracted animals, transformed dry rainforest into savanna. The introduction of the dingo by Aboriginal people around 3,000–4,000 years ago may, along with human hunting, have contributed to the extinction of the thylacine, <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>devil,</b> and Tasmanian native-hen from mainland Australia.|$|E
25|$|The {{island of}} Tasmania {{was home to}} the thylacine, a {{marsupial}} which resembled a Fossa (animal) or some say a wild dog. Known colloquially as the Tasmanian tiger for the distinctive striping across its back, it became extinct in mainland Australia much earlier because of competition by the dingo, introduced in prehistoric times. Owing to persecution by farmers, government-funded bounty hunters and, in the final years, collectors for overseas museums, {{it appears to have}} been exterminated in Tasmania. The <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>devil</b> became the largest carnivorous marsupial in the world following the extinction of the thylacine in 1936, and is now found in the wild only in Tasmania. Tasmania {{was one of the last}} regions of Australia to be introduced to domesticated dogs. Dogs were brought from Britain in 1803 for hunting kangaroos and emus. This introduction completely transformed Aboriginal society, as it helped them to successfully compete with European hunters, and was more important than the introduction of guns for the Aboriginals.|$|E
