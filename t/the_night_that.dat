25|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>that</b> {{the woman}} ritually {{traditionally}} immerses is about 12 days after menstruation began, it often coincides with a woman's ovulation, and thus improves {{the chances of}} successful conception if sexual relations occur on that night. However, for certain women, this period extends far past the date of ovulation, and {{in combination with the}} ban on sexual relations during the niddah state, effectively results in the woman being unable to conceive. In the case of this effective infertility, rabbis try on a case-by-case basis to relax halakhic strictures in order to facilitate conception. There have been some calls within Orthodox Judaism for the custom to be modified so that the time between the end of menstruation and the end of niddah isn't as long for these women.|$|E

The Good Friday service was moved to the afternoon, Holy Communion was no longer reserved for the priest alone (as before, hosts consecrated at the Holy Thursday Mass were used) and the priest no longer received part of the host in unconsecrated wine.
