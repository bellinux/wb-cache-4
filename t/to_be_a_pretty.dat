500|$|Skin {{is a major}} {{plot device}} in [...] "The Painted Skin", serving as a [...] "path between the {{separate}} worlds of human and animal, or the natural and the supernatural". Reality versus perception of it is another overarching issue; what Wang deems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> female {{is in fact a}} vicious demon. Moral courage trumps the occult and supernatural powers; the Taoist priest is unable to revive Wang with his magic, whereas Chen's sacrificial love is arguably more effective in doing so. By extension, this also decreases the credibility of religious institutions, continuing Pu's subtle criticism of religion present in many other Liaozhai stories. Pu also presents the trope of the [...] "beautiful talented ghost" [...] in an inverted fashion, portraying art, represented by the demon, as something [...] "utterly demonic"; Man's [...] "blind admiration" [...] of it can lead to his dire downfall.|$|E
50|$|As {{the curtain}} opens, four waiters and four {{cleaning}} women are preparing {{the room for}} the evening's entertainment. They dance a merry dance before the doors <b>are</b> opened <b>to</b> the public. The first <b>to</b> arrive <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> Flower Girl, who has come to sell her nosegays to the customers. She dances happily with the waiters, flouncing her skirts and petticoats, as the charladies depart. Next <b>to</b> enter <b>is</b> <b>a</b> gaggle of six cocodettes, flighty young women of questionable virtue, with three billiards players as their escorts. The group dances about the room in a rousing mazurka. At its conclusion, a glamorous Glove Seller {{appears in the doorway}} and waltzes into the room, charming everyone there. A change of music announces the arrival of a wealthy Peruvian tourist, who enters in a state of high excitement. Bearing two carpetbags, he <b>is</b> so eager <b>to</b> join the Parisian nightlife that he has not stopped to deposit his luggage. The cocodettes are interested in him, and in his apparent wealth, but he <b>is</b> attracted <b>to</b> the Glove Seller. Next, to the strains of a swelling waltz, a handsome Baron enters. He is welcomed by the Flower Girl, but he is immediately captivated by the Glove Seller. When they dance together, they seem to form a perfect partnership. Drum beats and march music then signal the arrival of an Officer and a platoon of soldiers. On the lookout for girls, the soldiers engage the cocodettes and the Flower Girl in another dance. Suddenly, a fashionable society beauty, a courtesan known as La Lionne, arrives, accompanied by her escort, a Duke, and a companion, the Lady in Green. The room is now filled with people seeking an evening's diversion, entertainment, and, possibly, amorous adventure.|$|R
500|$|The book {{generally}} received positive reception from literature critics. Publishers Weekly {{described it}} as [...] "golden SF from the Golden Age", and The Harvard Crimson called it [...] "one of the great classics" [...] of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. A reviewer writing in Publishers Weekly commented: [...] "Hubbard brilliantly evokes the vastness of space and the tragedy {{of those who would}} conquer it", and called the book [...] "one of his [...] finest works". Alan Cheuse reviewed the book in the San Francisco Chronicle, writing: [...] "As in a number of groundbreaking -- or time-breaking, I suppose we ought to say -- works of science fiction, the science behind the story is more interesting than the fiction itself. Hubbard <b>is</b> <b>a</b> thinker who writes, rather than a writer who thinks, as most masters are." [...] Cheuse highlighted the book among his 2004 literature holiday picks in a piece for National Public Radio's program All Things Considered: [...] "Before he began founding new religions, Hubbard was one of the country's most prolific pulp science fiction writers, and this book is one of his best." [...] Georges T. Dodds, columnist for WARP, newsletter/fanzine of the Montreal Science Fiction and Fantasy association writes [...] "besides being among the earliest hard science fiction works to consider time-dilation effects in long distance near-light-speed space travel, (<b>To</b> The Stars) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> entertaining story." ...|$|R
2500|$|The pair bottled {{their first}} vintage Cabernet Sauvignon in 1972, aging the {{wine in the}} old Keig Dairy barn on the {{original}} plot of land Duncan purchased. They {{made the decision to}} produce only Cabernet Sauvignon and to attempt to produce the finest in the world, to age the wine exclusively in American oak barrels. Meyer said of the reason for deciding to concentrate on one wine, [...] "it <b>was</b> kind of <b>a</b> reaction to my days at Christian Brothers, where we made so many wines it <b>was</b> hard <b>to</b> do them all right, {{and it was kind of}} in keeping with what I thought — that Cabernets were what Napa and Sonoma did best, so why not devote our attention <b>to</b> that. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> common concept in France." [...] According to noted wine critic Robert Parker, Meyer always believed in harvesting ripe, physiologically mature fruit. In answer to the question of why Silver Oak insists upon aging their wines in American oak barrels, Meyer once said, [...] "I'm happy with a cellar of about 65 degrees. Aging is speeded up by heat and slowed down by cold, but the only thing I do to modify my cellar is drink it faster... To my palate, American oak imparts less wood tannin than French oak. I like tannic wine about as much as I like tough steak." ...|$|R
500|$|Metacritic {{gave the}} episode a Metascore—a {{weighted}} average {{based on the}} impressions of a select 25 critical reviews—of 67, signifying generally favorable reviews. Barry Garron of The Hollywood Reporter found it promising because [...] "it is reminiscent of better-of-the-sexes charm". USA Todays Robert Bianco said, [...] "what Abrams brings to Fringe is a director's eye for plot and pace, a fan's love of sci-fi excitement, and a story-teller's gift for investing absurd events with real emotions and relatable characters." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN gave the pilot 7.6 out of 10, calling it [...] "a lackluster pilot that promises <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good series". Tim Goodman of San Francisco Chronicle remarked that despite [...] "some flaws in it—mostly from a clash of tones—it still overdelivers on creativity, creepiness, fine acting and burgeoning character development".

[...] In the words of critic Peter Hellman, [...] "If [...] could recite Budweiser jingles from TV, why not give them a program that would teach the ABCs and simple number concepts?" [...] Cooney wanted to create a program that would spread values favoring education to nonviewers—including their parents and older siblings, who tended to control the television set. [...] To this end, she suggested that humor directed toward adults be included, which, as Lesser reported, [...] "may turn out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good system in forcing the young child to stretch to understand programs designed for older audiences".

In a 2016 retrospective of the series, A.V.

500|$|Weiss {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} the introduction of Lyanna Mormont in the series, with Weiss saying, [...] "We were excited {{about the prospect of}} the character because she's mentioned in passing in the previous season," [...] referring to her letter to Stannis denying him men, and swearing fealty to House Stark. Weiss added, [...] "The more we thought about it, Jon <b>is</b> going <b>to</b> come up against so many old guys with beards in the North that like 'What if she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> tougher audience?' It seemed like an inherently fun scene to watch, it also is terrifying because it's putting a lot of dramatic weight on the shoulders of somebody who needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very young."

There's not {{a lot of room for}} sort of soft, and gentle psychology.

Bustles Amy Roberts theorized that, like most of the songs from Joanne, [...] "Million Reasons" [...] had extra hidden depth in its lyrics and predicted it to be about Gaga's separated boyfriend Taylor Kinney. The phrase [...] "quit the show" [...] was described as a metaphor by Roberts about Gaga feeling dejected about her life, with the second verses confirming this. Both romantic heartbreak as catalyst and religious faith of the singer were represented as different sides of the lyrics. Roberts concluded by saying that [...] "hough the song may seem extremely fraught with sadness, confusion and heartache, its main message appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> positive one".|$|E
