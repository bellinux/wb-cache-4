25|$|Vestas Wind Systems has {{constructed}} the largest (nearly 700,000 square feet) wind <b>turbine</b> <b>tower</b> manufacturing {{plant in the}} world at Pueblo's industrial park.|$|E
25|$|When a turbine {{is mounted}} on a rooftop the {{building}} generally redirects wind over the roof and this can double the wind speed at the turbine. If {{the height of a}} rooftop mounted <b>turbine</b> <b>tower</b> is approximately 50% of the building height it is near the optimum for maximum wind energy and minimum wind turbulence. Wind speeds within the built environment are generally much lower than at exposed rural sites, noise may be a concern and an existing structure may not adequately resist the additional stress.|$|E
25|$|More than 35 {{percent of}} the {{electric}} power generated in Iowa now comes from wind power. Iowa had over 6900 megawatts (MW) of generation capacity {{at the end of}} 2016. Electrical energy generated in Iowa by wind in 2014 amounted to over 16 million Megawatt-hours. Since Iowa adopted a renewable energy standard in 1983, the wind power industry has generated over $10 billion in investment. The second concrete wind <b>turbine</b> <b>tower</b> to be built in the U.S., and also the country's tallest (377 feet) at the time built, is in Adams county. The tower was completed in the spring of 2016.|$|E

2500|$|The typical {{construction}} process for a wind turbine subsea monopile foundation in sand includes driving a large hollow steel pile, of some 4m in diameter with approximately 50mm thick walls, some 25m {{deep into the}} seabed, through a 0.5m layer of larger stone and gravel to minimize erosion around the pile. [...] A [...] "transition piece (complete with pre-installed features such as boat-landing arrangement, cathodic protection, cable ducts for sub-marine cables, <b>turbine</b> <b>tower</b> flange, etc.)" [...] {{is attached to the}} now deeply driven pile, the sand and water are removed from the centre of the pile and replaced with concrete. [...] An additional layer of even larger stone, up to 0.5m diameter, is applied {{to the surface of the}} seabed for longer-term erosion protection.|$|E

50|$|Wood {{is being}} {{investigated}} as a material for wind <b>turbine</b> <b>towers,</b> and a 100 metre tall tower supporting a 1.5 MW turbine has been erected in Germany. The wood tower shares the same transportation benefits of the segmented steel shell tower, but without the steel resource consumption.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{began in}} June 2006. Contractor for the {{foundation}} installation was MT Højgaard: the foundation design was by Ramboll, Smulders supplied the WTG foundations, <b>turbine</b> <b>towers</b> by Bladt Industries, monopiles and transition pieces were from Sif; piling {{was done by}} Menck, with Mammoet Van Oord supplying lifting barge platform Jumping Jack.|$|R
50|$|Trois-Rivières is {{attempting}} an industrial revitalization by establishing technology parks and {{taking advantage of}} its central location to both Montreal and Quebec City, its university and port.
