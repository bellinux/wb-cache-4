5|$|Post-flight {{inspection}} of the <b>thermal</b> <b>protection</b> system tiles found seven major debris impacts and forty-nine minor impacts, of which three and twenty-six respectively were on the orbiter's underside. This was the lowest incidence of major tile damage until at least STS-74, and compares very favorably with the program average of twenty-three major impacts to the underside. It was the first Shuttle flight with no significant problems reported for the <b>thermal</b> <b>protection</b> system. Three windows {{were removed from the}} orbiter due to pitting and hazing.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the morning}} wake up call, the crew {{began work on}} the day's tasks, which were {{centered}} on inspection of the orbiter's heat shield. Using the shuttle robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), the crew went through a detailed inspection of the orbiter's <b>thermal</b> <b>protection</b> system (TPS) tile and Reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) surfaces. During the inspection, engineers on the ground noticed a small area of tile on the forward area of the shuttle's right wing that appeared to have suffered some damage during ascent.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{separation}} burn, the crew {{set to work}} performing the standard late inspection of the <b>thermal</b> <b>protection</b> system of the orbiter. Using the robotic arm, McArthur, Altman, and Johnson worked through the procedures to inspect the wing leading-edge panels, reinforced carbon-carbon nose cap, and heat shield tiles. After evaluating the weather reports, managers on the ground slightly refined the schedule for landing, opting to bring the shuttle home one orbit early {{to try to avoid}} the possibility of showers that would prevent a landing on Friday. The new landing opportunity would bring the crew home at 10:01am EDT.|$|E
5|$|Risk {{management}} is {{obtained by the}} usual measures of engineering controls, administrative controls and procedures, and personal protective equipment, including hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRA), protective equipment, medical screening, training and standardised procedures. Professional divers are generally legally obliged to carry out and formally record these measures, and though recreational divers are not legally required to do many of them, competent recreational divers, and particularly technical divers, generally perform them informally but routinely, and they {{are an important part}} of technical diver training. For example, a medical statement or examination for fitness, pre-dive site assessment and briefing, safety drills, <b>thermal</b> <b>protection,</b> equipment redundancy, alternative air source, buddy checks, buddy or team diving procedures, dive planning, underwater hand signals, and carrying first aid and oxygen administration equipment are all routinely part of technical diving.|$|E

5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault introduced diffuser designs similar to the Red Bull RB6. Ferrari's design largely changed the shape of their exhaust system, and introduced a new gearbox case for Massa's car to raise the pick-up points of its rear suspension to help him adjust to the changes. They constructed a larger radiator to deal with the additional heat. Mercedes elected not to bring a new gearbox casing, but introduced a new rear diffuser to fully utilise the air blowing from the car's exhaust. Renault's design had the exit of their car's exhaust which had <b>thermal</b> <b>protection</b> against high temperatures and the team introduced a new design of their gearbox casing to allow for the pick-up points for its rear suspension to be accommodated. After running the F-duct device (which increases a car's top speed) in Friday practice, Red Bull decided to use it {{for the remainder of the}} weekend.|$|E
5|$|Divers {{operate in}} an {{environment}} for which {{the human body is}} not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or <b>thermal</b> <b>protection</b> can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also hazards of the specific diving environment, and hazards related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. Hazards inherent in the diver include pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour and competence of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional hazards of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task.|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{this paper}} is to the analyze of the eects of a ﬂying object, advected by the motor {{internal}} ﬂow, on the internal ballistics of an aft-ﬁnocyl SRM, with typical characteristics of a stage or a small booster. The objective is to provide a preliminary study able to give an assessment of the eects on SRM internal ballistics of the outﬂow from the nozzle of pieces of the SRM components (i. e. expendable igniter) or, more realistically, pieces of <b>thermal</b> <b>protections</b> of relevant dimensions (with respect to the nozzle throat area of the SRM) detached from SRM components (ﬂoaters, igniter, casing <b>thermal</b> <b>protections).</b> The numerical simulation of the moving object will be performed with a Q 1 D unsteady model of the SRM internal ballistics, as presented in the following section. The idea is, in fact, to obtain from the simulations a feeling about the physics of the problem, without having to face too high computational costs and complexities for the simulation. In fact, the use of more simpliﬁed approaches like 0 D models, both steady and quasisteady, may imply the risk that too rough simpliﬁcations of the problem analyzed may brings to useless qualitative and quantitative comparisons with the experimental data. On the other hand, the computational costs and complexity of the problem faced with axisymmetric or 3 D approaches is prohibitive and not useful for a preliminary study. For these reasons, the analysis will not cover the simulation of an object carried by the ﬂow in the nozzle, with the scope to prove or not the possibility that the ﬂying object can impact the nozzle itself (which in the typical ﬂowﬁeld conditions of the nozzle seems to be possible only for an object with a irregular - e. g. not a sphere). A grid convergence analysis for the computed solutions and a parametric analysis will be performed in order to achieve the objectives of the work...|$|R

40|$|During {{hypersonic}} flight {{the temperatures}} on the vehicle can reach very high values in certain locations. A hypersonic flight vehicle {{needs to be}} designed aerodynamically efficient. That results in rather small nose and leading edge radii which drives up thermal loads {{due to the fact}} that the loads depend on the curvature radius of these elements. Therefore <b>thermal</b> <b>protections</b> is required for these elements. However, even ceramics reach their use temperature limits when e. g. the leading edge radius of a space plane is in the order of only a few centimeters. Transpiration cooling could be a means to handle the thermal loads in certain critical locations for a hypersonic flight vehicle.

40|$|The Icing Technology Branch at NASA Lewis {{has been}} {{involved}} in an effort to validate two <b>thermal</b> ice <b>protection</b> codes developed at the NASA Lewis Research Center. LEWICE/Thermal (electrothermal deicing & anti-icing), and ANTICE (hot-gas & electrothermal anti-icing). The Thermal Code Validation effort was designated as a priority during a 1994 'peer review' of the NASA Lewis Icing program, and was implemented as a cooperative effort with industry. During April 1996, {{the first of a series}} of experimental validation tests was conducted in the NASA Lewis Icing Research Tunnel(IRT). The purpose of the April 96 test was to validate the electrothermal predictive capabilities of both LEWICE/Thermal, and ANTICE. A heavily instrumented test article was designed and fabricated for this test, with the capability of simulating electrothermal de-icing and anti-icing modes of operation. Thermal measurements were then obtained over a range of test conditions, for comparison with analytical predictions. This paper will present an overview of the test, including a detailed description of: (1) the validation process; (2) test article design; (3) test matrix development; and (4) test procedures. Selected experimental results will be presented for de-icing and anti-icing modes of operation. Finally, the status of the validation effort at this point will be summarized.
