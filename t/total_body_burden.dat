5|$|Blood {{lead levels}} are an {{indicator}} mainly of recent or current lead exposure, not of <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>burden.</b> Lead in bones {{can be measured}} noninvasively by X-ray fluorescence; {{this may be the}} best measure of cumulative exposure and <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>burden.</b> However this method is not widely available and is mainly used for research rather than routine diagnosis. Another radiographic sign of elevated lead levels is the presence of radiodense lines called lead lines at the metaphysis in the long bones of growing children, especially around the knees. These lead lines, caused by increased calcification due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing foreign materials such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In humans, {{persistent}} {{organic pollutants}} (POPs) are stored primarily in adipose tissue.

OBJECTIVES: We characterized POP <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>burden</b> and their redistribution in obese individuals before and after drastic weight loss and compared these values {{with a variety of}} molecular, biological, and clinical parameters. METHODS: Seventy-one obese subjects were enrolled and underwent bariatric surgery. Blood and adipose tissue samples were obtained at different times from these individuals as well as from 18 lean women. RESULTS: POP content (17 dioxins/furans and 18 polychlorinated biphenyl congeners) in different adipose tissue territories was similar, allowing us to assess total POP body burden from a single biopsy. Total POP body burden was 2 to 3 times higher in obese than in lean individuals. We also found increased expression of some POP target genes in obese adipose tissue. Drastic weight loss led to increased serum POPs and, within 6 - 12 months, to a significant 15 % decrease in total polychlorinated biphenyl body burden. Importantly, serum POP levels were positively correlated with liver toxicity markers and lipid parameters, independently of age and body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: POP content in adipose tissue and serum correlate with biological markers of obesity-related dysfunctions.

Therefore, bone F concentrations are considered biomarkers for <b>total</b> F <b>body</b> <b>burden</b> (exposure). However, difficult accessibility limits its use as a biomarker. Thus, a more accessible tissue should be considered and analyzed as a biomarker for <b>total</b> F <b>body</b> <b>burden.</b> The objective of this study, which was divided into two parts, was to evaluate teeth as a biomarker for skeletal F exposure. In part 1 of the study, 70 mice of three different strains (SWR/J, A/J and 129 P 3 /J) were exposed to different levels of water fluoridation (0, 25, 50 and 100 ppm). Bone (femora and vertebrae) and teeth from these mice were then analyzed for F concentration using Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA). In part 2 of the study, human teeth (enamel and dentin) and bone from 30 study subjects were collected and analyzed for F concentration using INAA. Study subjects lived in areas with optimum levels of water fluoridation (0. 7 and 1 ppm) and underwent therapeutic extraction of their unerupted third molars. The values of bone and teeth F concentration were correlated for parts 1 and 2 of this study. The results showed that in the animal model, where animals were exposed {{to a wide range}} of F in their drinking water, tooth [F] correlated with bone [F]. However, no correlation was seen between bone and enamel F concentrations or between bone and dentin F concentrations in the human samples.

The dynamics and fate of DSP toxins were investigated {{in the bay}} scallop Argopecten irradians exposed to cells of the epibenthic dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima, a known producer of DSP toxins, in controlled laboratory microcosms. Toxin parameters determined were uptake and detoxification rates, and anatomical compartmentalization. Toxins in tissue and algal extracts were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). No mortalities occurred and feeding inhibition was not observed for juvenile and adult bay scallops during the 2 wk exposure to P, lima cells. Clearance rates were similar for scallops exposed to equivalent biovolume cell concentrations of toxigenic P. lima and the non-toxic diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii; however, absorption efficiency of organic matter was significantly lower with a diet of P. Lima than T. weissflogii, Although DSP toxin concentrations in viscera of bay scallop exceeded commonly accepted regulatory levels (0. 2 mug g(- 1) whole tissue) within 24 h of exposure to P. lima, after 2 wk of exposure total DSP toxin retained in scallop tissues was < 1 % of the total toxin ingested over the same period. Most of the <b>total</b> toxin <b>body</b> <b>burden</b> was in the viscera (76 %); however, in adult scallops a significant portion was associated with gonadal tissue (12 %).

Joint size did not determine the contribution to the systemic biomarker concentration. Biomarker correlation with disease in the lumbar spine resembled that in the rest of the skeleton. We have suspected that the correlation of systemic biomarkers with disease has been hampered by the inability to fully phenotype the burden of OA in a patient.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of chemically dispersed oil on an economically and ecologically important species inhabiting coasts and estuaries, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Studies were carried out with juveniles, known to generally be more sensitive to environmental stress than adults. A set of enzyme activities involved in immune defence mechanisms and detoxification processes, i. e. superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catecholase-type phenoloxidase (PO), laccase-type PO and lysozyme were analysed in different oyster tissues, i. e. the gills, digestive gland and mantle, and in the plasma and the haemoycte lysate supernatant (HLS) of the haemolymph. Results indicated that <b>total</b> PAH <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> were 2. 7 times higher in the presence than in the absence of the chemical dispersant. After 2 days of exposure to chemically dispersed oil, alkylated naphthalenes accounted for 55 % of the <b>total</b> PAH <b>body</b> <b>burden,</b> whereas alkylated fluorenes and alkylated dibenzothiophenes accounted for 80 % when the chemical dispersant was absent. Importantly, a higher number of enzyme activities were modified when oil was chemically dispersed, especially in the plasma and gills. Moreover, independently of the presence or absence of chemical dispersant, oil exposure generally inhibited enzyme activities in the gills and plasma, while they were generally activated in the mantle and haemocytes. These results suggest that the gills and plasma constitute sensitive compartments in C. gigas, and that mantle and haemocytes may play an important role in protection against xenobiotics. Among the six enzyme activities that were analysed in these body compartments, five were modulated in the chemical dispersion (CD) treatment while only half of the enzyme activities were modulated in the mechanical dispersion treatment. Furthermore, CD treatment effects were often observed following exposure, but also during depuration periods. These results suggest that immune and/or detoxification responses are likely to be affected when dispersants are used to treat oil spills in shallow waters...|$|R
40|$|Hydrophobic organic {{chemicals}} (HOCs) are {{a class of}} environmental contaminants responsible for numerous acute and chronic health effects in humans and wildlife. This thesis illustrates three applications of polyethylene (PE) passive sampling, which enhance our toolbox for estimating environmental hazards associated with HOCs. First, we present a methodology {{that can be used}} to estimate the bioaccumulation potential of numerous {{organic chemicals}} based on passive sampling and comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC). Using GC x GC retention times, we show that lipid-water and samplerwater partition coefficients can be estimated within a factor of 2 and 3, respectively. The method was then applied to estimate <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> of various HOCs in benthic organisms from GC x GC analysis of PE equilibrated with contaminated sediment. Empirical observations of accumulation in the Nereis virens polychaete were in good agreement with PE-based predictions for PCBs, but were lower by at least an order of magnitude for other classes of HOCs (such as PAHs) presumably due to metabolism. Second, we applied the same methodology to a set of contaminated sediments and estimated the cumulative baseline toxicity associated with environmental mixtures of HOCs. The predictions were compared against empirical measurements of baseline toxicity using the water flea Daphnia magna. The estimated <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> of HOCs were in good agreement with measured toxicity, with toxicity occurring at <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> larger than 30 mg/gipid. In contrast, the toxicity estimated based on priority pollutants severely underestimated the observed toxicity, emphasizing the importance of cumulative effects. Lastly, to advance our understanding of the processes that affect passive sampling results in situ (when they are operating away from equilibrium), a mathematical model was developed for reactive chemicals transferring between PE and sediment beds. The reaction diffusion model was used to infer in situ degradation rates of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), which in the sediments of a freshwater lake were found to be between 0. 09 and 0. 9 d- 1. A second mathematical model describing the kinetics of exchange between passive samplers and water was also developed, which can be used in both field (infinite baths) and laboratory (finite baths) conditions. by Alexandra Patricia Tcaciuc.

The mercury in the amalgam is continuously released over time as elemental mercury vapor (Begerow et al., 1994). Research indicates that this pathway contributes to the <b>total</b> mercury <b>body</b> <b>burden,</b> with mercury levels in some body fluids correlating with the amount and surface area of fillings for non-occupationally exposed individuals (Langworth et al., 1991; Olstad et al., 1987; Snapp et al., 1989). For the average individual an intake of 2 - 20 µg/day of elemental mercury vapor is estimated from this pathway (Begerow et al., 1994). Additionally, during and immediately following removal or installation of dental amalgams supplementary exposures of 1 - 5 µg/day for several days can be expected (Geurtsen 1990). Approximately 80 % of the elemental mercury vapor released by dental amalgams is expected to be re-absorbed by the lungs (Begerow et al., 1994). In contrast, dietary inorganic mercury absorption via the gastrointestinal tract is known the be about 7 %. The contribution to the <b>body</b> <b>burden</b> of inorganic mercury is thus, greater from dental amalgams than from the diet or any other source. The inorganic mercury is excreted in urine, and methylmercury is mainly excreted in feces. Since urinary mercury levels will only result from inorganic mercury intake, which occurs almost exclusively from dietary an...|$|R
40|$|The use of mussels as {{indicators}} of pollution in fresh- and seawater was reviewed {{and the ability of}} the freshwater mussel 'Anodonta anatina' to absorb Cadmium- 115 m and zinc- 65 from its environment was studied. The uptake was studied when the metals were available in solution only and in the algal food supply. A higher accumulation occurred in the tissues when the metals were available in the food and they were concentrated up to 2 x 10 [sup] 3 times for zinc- 65 and 1 x 10 [sup] 3 times for cadmium- 115 m above the levels found in the water. Those tissues with large surface areas in contact with the water (i. e. the gills and the mantle) and those involved with processing food (i. e. the digestive gland and kidney) were found to take up the tracers most rapidly. The muscular tissues took up the least amount of tracers. The uptake into the tissues from each source was compared and the metabolic consequences discussed. Depuration of the metals from the tissues was studied when the mussels were placed in uncontaminated water. Although the <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> of the tracers declined, a loss was not recorded for all the tissues. For some tissues, notably the digestive gland and the adductor muscles with cadmium- 155 m and the gonad and kidney with zinc- 65, a continued uptake was recorded. It was concluded that permanent binding sites for the metals might exist in some tissues. The fate of cadmium in the tissues was studied. Cadmium was found to be located in the cytosol and associated with low molecular weight proteins. These proteins were found to have low aromatic amino acid and high cysteine content as indicated by their absorption characteristics at 280 and 250 nm respectively. These properties together with the demonstrated heat stability indicated that the cadmium-binding proteins in 'Andonta' are similar to metallothioneins indentified in other species...|$|R
40|$|Hazardous {{substances}} that originally are discharged as air pollutants may find their pathway to human exposure through multiple routes, including ingestion and dermal contact, {{as well as}} direct inhalation. The mechanisms for modeling and understanding the fate of air pollutants through atmospheric transport, deposition into water and soil, bioaccumulation, and ultimate uptake to receptor organs and systems {{in the human body}} are complex. Pollution prevention programs can be better engineered, pollution priorities can be identified, and greater environmental public health gains [attributable to pollution prevention] can be achieved by evaluating the multiple pathways to human exposure and through improved dosage calcu-lations. A single contaminant source often may represent only a fraction of a <b>total</b> <b>body</b> pollutant <b>burden.</b> Further research is needed on source culpability and attributable risk, long-range transport of air pollutants, human dose contributions by various pathways, better techniques for health risk assessment, and an identification of human behavior patterns that affect exposure and dose.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of dermal {{exposure to the}} <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>burden</b> of a given chemical is difficult to assess. However, {{it is possible that}} as regulatory pressures lead to reductions in inhalation exposure, the proportion of uptake via the dermal route will increase. This study brings together recent work in the field of dermal exposure to provide a model to estimate both exposure and uptake of solvents through the skin. Using spray painters as an example, the process of modelling exposure is described from identifying the determinants of exposure through to calculating the flux of solvent through the stratum corneum and thus the total dermal uptake. Results from a range of exposure scenarios are presented and areas requiring further research and validation are highlighted. The model should allow the estimation of combined dermal and inhalation exposure to solvents in both current work situations and retrospective epidemiological studies. Furthermore, it is envisaged that the model may provide the basis for generic assessment of dermal exposure and uptake. © 2001 British Occupational Hygiene Society.

40|$|International audienceTotal (T-Hg) {{and organic}} (O-Hg) mercury {{concentrations}} and tissue distribution {{were examined in}} 20 species of cephalopods (n = 278) from the north eastern Atlantic waters, i. e. from the Bay of Biscay to the Faroe Islands. Concentrations of T-Hg in whole cephalopods showed elevated variations among species, i. e. from 40 to 3560 ng. g- 1 dwt, but a low variability within each species (mean CV% = 39 %). With the exception of oceanic squids, the digestive gland globally displayed higher T-Hg concentrations than the remaining tissues. In contrast, O-Hg concentrations determined in selected species were generally higher in the remaining tissues. Despite higher T-Hg concentrations, the digestive gland weakly contributed to the <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>burden</b> of both T-Hg and O-Hg (Bay of Biscay > Faroe Islands, corresponding to the seawater Hg concentrations in these areas.

40|$|Background. Bisphenol A (BPA) is an {{ubiquitous}} {{chemical contaminant}} that {{has recently been}} associated with adverse effects on human health. There is incomplete understanding of BPA toxicokinetics, {{and there are no}} established interventions to eliminate this compound from the human body. Using 20 study participants, {{this study was designed to}} assess the relative concentration of BPA in three body fluids—blood, urine, and sweat—and to determine whether induced sweating may be a therapeutic intervention with potential to facilitate elimination of this compound. Methods. Blood, urine, and sweat were collected from 20 individuals (10 healthy participants and 10 participants with assorted health problems) and analyzed for various environmental toxicants including BPA. Results. BPA was found to differing degrees in each of blood, urine, and sweat. In 16 of 20 participants, BPA was identified in sweat, even in some individuals with no BPA detected in their serum or urine samples. Conclusions. Biomonitoring of BPA through blood and/or urine testing may underestimate the <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>burden</b> of this potential toxicant. Sweat analysis should be considered as an additional method for monitoring bioaccumulation of BPA in humans. Induced sweating appears to be a potential method for elimination of BPA...|$|E

As scientists {{who are involved in}} preparing a German federal guidline regard-ing dental amalgam, we welcome additional scientific data on this issue. However, Clarkson and Magos do not present all the relevant studies in their review. The additional data provided here show that: (a) Dental amalgam is the main source of human <b>total</b> mercury <b>body</b> <b>burden,</b> because individuals with amalgam have 2 – 12 times more mercury in their body tissues compared to in-dividuals without amalgam; (b) there is not necessarily a correlation between mercury levels in blood, urine, or hair and in body tissues, and none of the parameters correlate with severity of symptoms; (c) the half-life of mercury deposits in brain and bone tissues could last from several years to decades, and thus mercury accumulates over time of exposure; (d) mercury, in particular mercury vapor, is known to be the most toxic nonradioactive element, and is toxic even in very low doses, and (e) some studies which conclude that amalgam fillings are safe for human beings have important methodogical flaws. Therefore, they have no value for assessing the safety of amalgam...|$|R
40|$|Larvae {{of aquatic}} Diptera are {{important}} predators in fishless wetlands of northeast Alberta. Annual production was estimated for benthic (Chironomidae: Tanypodinae) and pelagic (Chaoboridae: Chaoborus) dipteran populations in 4 wetlands in surface-mined {{areas of the}} Athabasca oil sands, two of which received oil sands mine process material (OSPM; containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)), and two of which were reference wetlands. The structure of benthic and pelagic food webs was estimated by measuring stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. Stable nitrogen isotopes were also used to determine trophic levels of Tanypodinae and Chaoborus {{in order to determine}} their potential to bioaccumulate PAHs. Annual production was estimated along with <b>total</b> PAH <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> to determine the potential for biomass and PAH export by the emergent adult insects. Tanypodinae production (1. 55 [...] 28. 77 g/m 2 /y) consistently exceeded Chaoborus production (0. 009 [...] 0. 372 g/m 2 /y). Chaoborus trophic position estimates were consistently greater than estimates for Tanypodinae, suggesting greater PAH bioaccumulation potential for Chaoborus. Tanypodinae had greater potential to export PAHs (1. 86 [...] 37. 1 mg/m 2 /y) than Chaoborus (1. 1 x 10 - 2 [...] 4. 5 x 10 - 1 mg/m 2 /y) due to greater production and PAH <b>body</b> <b>burdens.</b> (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|Haul-out {{periods in}} most phocids are {{particularly}} intense from a physiological {{point of view}} since they involve extended fasting periods associated with behaviours or processes resulting in considerable energy expenditure (e. g., combat, mating, lactation, moulting). The substantial tissue reorganization during these key periods can entail the mobilization of potentially associated contaminants, such as trace elements and persistent organic pollutants. The main objectives {{of this study were}} firstly to investigate the effects of fasting, lactational, and developmental phases on trace element concentrations (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb, Se, V, and Zn) in the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) and the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus), and on the other hand, to assess the maternal transfer of trace elements to the offspring. Changes in the diet indicators – the carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) – were also investigated throughout lactation and post-weaning fast, and their implications were developed. Different tissue samples (blood, blubber, hair, and milk) were collected repeatedly in mother-pup pairs and weaned pups in northern elephant seals and grey seals during three longitudinal fieldworks in the breeding season. Related to the remobilization of resources during lactation and pup development, short-term variations in blood concentrations of trace elements were highlighted in this study. The results imply a careful consideration of the physiological status of marine mammals when using blood in the framework of biomonitoring of trace element contamination. Although the <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>burdens</b> of trace elements decreased over lactation in adult females, circulating concentrations of some metals, like Hg, increased significantly, drawing attention to the potential adverse effects on the immune, endocrine or nervous systems in adults. Northern elephant seals and grey seals are exposed to trace elements from the first stages of development through the placenta and through the milk. 	Indeed, concentrations in pup hair of both species revealed a large accumulation of all assayed trace elements during the foetal development. The maternal transfer of trace elements adds to lactational transfer of others chemicals such PCBs, PBDEs, and OCPs reported in recent studies. Immunotoxic and endocrine risks related to chemical mixtures remain unclear until now and may therefore affect phocids at a crucial period of their immune development...|$|R
