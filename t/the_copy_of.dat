The Wilton Diptych was painted during the reign of Richard II of England and is the most famous {{representation}} of Edmund in art. Painted on oak panels, it shows Richard kneeling in front of three saints—one of whom is Edmund—as they present the young king to the Virgin and Child.|$|E
5|$|Trump {{also claimed}} {{to own the}} {{painting}} Two Sisters (On the Terrace), an 1881 work by French Impressionist artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The original work hangs in the Art Institute of Chicago. In October 2017, Timothy L. O'Brien said that during his interviews with Trump for the book , he asked Trump about <b>the</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> Two Sisters, which was then located on Trump's plane. Trump repeatedly said that his copy was the genuine work, despite O'Brien's statements to the contrary. By then, the Renoir copy was hanging in Trump's penthouse office, and the Art Institute of Chicago released a statement refuting Trump's claim that his Renoir copy was the genuine one.|$|E

We show that certain ultrahomogenous binary {{relational structure}}s, for example the Rado graph, are rainbow Ramsey. Via compactness this then implies that for all finite graphs B and C and k ∈ω, there exists a graph A so that for every colouring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> C in A such that each colour is used at most k times, there exists a <b>copy</b> B^∗ <b>of</b> B in A so that <b>the</b> <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> C in B^∗ use each colour at most once.

5|$|Many of Goya's preparatory drawings, {{mostly in}} red chalk, have survived and are {{numbered}} {{differently from the}} published prints. He produced two albums of proofs—among many individual proof impressions—of which only one is complete. The full album consists of 85 works, including three small Prisioneros ("Prisoners") made in 1811 which {{are not part of}} the series. Goya gave <b>the</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> the full album, now in the British Museum, to his friend Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez. It contains a title-page inscription in Goya's hand, is signed at the page edges, and has numbers and titles to the prints written by Goya. These were copied on the plates when the published edition was prepared in 1863. By then, 80 had passed from Goya's son, Javier—who had stored them in Madrid after his father left Spain—to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando (Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando), of which Goya had been director. Numbers 81 and 82 rejoined the others in the Academy in 1870, and were not published until 1957.|$|E

25|$|Three {{examples}} of early English printing were {{donated to the}} Library by Gwendoline and Margaret Davies of Gregynog in 1921.

The third is another copy of the Polychronicon, printed by Caxton's successor Wynkyn de Worde in 1495. Nine specimens of early printed books (three German, five Italian and one printed in Ghent) were deposited by Lord Harlech between 1938 and 1941. Other notable incunabula in the Library are the Astronomica by Marcus Manilius (1474) with illuminated initials and borders, and Hartmann Schedel's Liber Chronicarum (1493).|$|E
25|$|The Diamond Age is {{characterized}} by two intersecting, almost equally-developed story lines: Nell's education through her independent work with the Primer, and the social downfall of engineer and designer of the Primer, John Percival Hackworth, who has made two illegal copies of the Primer for his own young daughter, Fiona. (One copy is stolen by Nell's brother.) His crime becomes known both to Lord Finkle-McGraw and to Dr. X, the black market engineer whose compiler Hackworth used to create <b>the</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> the Primer, and each man attempts to exploit Hackworth to advance the opposing goals of their tribes. A third storyline follows an actress, Miranda, who plays the voice of Nell's Primer and has almost become Nell's surrogate mother, in her attempts to find Nell. Later Miranda's storyline is taken over by Miranda's associate Carl Hollywood after Miranda disappears.|$|E
