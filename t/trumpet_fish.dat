50|$|The U.S.V.I {{is home to}} 386 {{square miles}} of coral reefs, {{which is more than}} twice the archipelago’s total landmass and is a {{critical}} habitat for hundreds of tropical fish species and coral species. The coral reefs also provide habitat for mollusks, sea urchins, sea fans, sea anemones and sponges. Some of the coral species found here are the elkhorn coral, brain coral, pillar coral, staghorn coral, fire coral, sea whips, star coral and finger coral. Along the many coral reefs are also numerous crabs, lobsters, parrot fish, damselfish, goatfish, wrasse, triggerfish, trunkfish, <b>trumpet</b> <b>fish,</b> angelfish, squid, sea turtles and octopus.|$|E
50|$|Declared a “Protected Marine Area” by the Maldivian government, Kudarah Thila is {{a popular}} dive site which enjoys many {{incoming}} currents. Coral reef formations here are bright and colorful, including a variety of soft and hard corals. Thila means “Pinnacle” in Dhivehi and at Kudarah Thila there are actually four pinnacles, which can be all visited in one dive. A swim-through at the south-east corner of the dive site {{is a popular}} choice. Marine life can include <b>trumpet</b> <b>fish,</b> snapper, gobies, dartfish, oriental sweetlips and groupers. A little further away from the reef, divers are likely to see gray reef sharks, napoleon fish and sea turtles.|$|E
50|$|The Resort {{is home to}} the Ruahatu Lagoon Sanctuary, a {{research}} facility and home to over 100 species of marine life. Marine biologist Oliver Martin conducts ongoing research, teaches the principles of conservation to guests on daily tours and grafts coral in effort to further the development of the lagoon. Marine life within the lagoon include such species as octopus, eagle ray, lizard fish, Picasso <b>trumpet</b> <b>fish,</b> soldier fish, fire fish, unicorn fish, spotted puffer fish, parrot fish, peacock damsel fish, clown fish, butterfly fish, sea urchin, anemone and shrimp. The lagoon sanctuary is maintained in partnership with the Pacific Eco-World Initiative, a non-profit organization.|$|E
50|$|The {{marine life}} found here {{consists}} of anemones, urchins, sea cucumbers, and eels, which all {{live on the}} reefs along with turtles, conch and many varieties of marine fishes. The marine aquafauna is rich in conch, which has pearly-pink shells. Its meat is a favourite food supplement item and their shells are a collectors item. Other species of fish which are recorded close to the shore line in shallow waters are: sergeant majors, the blue chromis, brown chromis, surgeon fish; blue tangs and <b>trumpet</b> <b>fish.</b> On the shore are ghost crabs, which always live {{on the beach in}} small burrowed tunnels made in sand, and the hermit crabs, which live in land but lay eggs in water and which also eat garbage and sewerage. They spend some months in the sea during and after the hatching season.|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{descriptions}} and observations on six rare fishes recently captured in Tasmanian waters -The {{following are the}} Fishes particularly referred to: Family Percidae-Genus oligorus, Oligorus gigas. Owen. Hapuka. Family Pristipomatidae:—Genus Erythrichthys: Erythrichthys nitidus. Rich. This is the first representative of the species seen by me during a residence of 14 years in Tasmania. I have reason to believe, however, that it is seen by fishermen occasionally {{in the neighborhood of}} Swansea. Usually found Molucca sea, Sunda sea, Australasian seas and Pacific. Family Cirrhitidae. Latris ciliaris. Forst. Locally known as "Moki," in New Zealand. Habitat-Port Jackson and Tasmania, not common; New Zealand, abundant. Family Centriscidae:. Centriscus scolopax, L. The Snipe, Bugler, or <b>Trumpet</b> <b>Fish.</b> Habitat-Atlantic, South Coast of England, Mediterranean, Tasmania. Family Labridae Cossyphus unimaculatus. Gunth. "Pig Fish" of Sydney Fishermen (Macleay). No doubt, like the Schnapper, it is a straggler, otherwise it would be captured more frequently on our trumpeter fishing grounds. Labrichthys mortonii, n. s. Habitat: Mouth of Derwent: Found occasionally at a depth of 40 to 50 fathoms...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} diet of the Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) in several {{islands of the}} Azores during 1994, based on the {{analysis}} of 777 food pellets. The diet of Common Terns {{was based on a}} few species of small pelagic fish. <b>Trumpet</b> <b>Fish</b> (Macroramphosus spp.) dominated the. diet in terms of both frequency of occurrence (84 %) and numerical frequency (69 %). This species, together with Boarfish (Capros aper), Blue Jack Mackerel (Trachurus picturatus) and lantern fish (Families Myctophidae, Sternoptychidae, Diretmidae), accounted for more than 96 % of the prey taken by Common Terns on all the islands. Insects occurred in 10 % of all pellets analyzed and were present in almost 15 % of the pellets from Corvo. Lantern fish represented an important fraction of the diet of Common Terns in the Azores and included several species previously undescribed as prey of seabirds in the region. Comparisons with dietary data obtained in subsequent years showed little inter- annual variability in the frequency of abundance of the main prey species, except for the lantern fish, which exhibited a higher frequency Of Occurrence in 199...|$|E
40|$|Extract] O nce an {{observer}} gets past the stunning coloration, surely no feature inspires wonder in coral reef fishes {{so much as}} their morphological diversity. From large-mouthed groupers, to beaked parrotfish, barbeled goatfish, long-snouted <b>trumpet</b> <b>fish,</b> snaggle-toothed tusk fish, tube-mouthed planktivores, and fat-lipped sweet lips, coral reef fishes display a dazzling array of feeding structures. And, even the most casual fish watcher quickly gets a sense that this diversity means something, that fish form is related to what the animals eat. Clearly {{there is something to}} this impression, but just how are head and body morphology connected to prey choice? Are we really able to predict what a reef fish eats from studying its jaws and teeth? What are the major axes of diversification that are seen in reef fishes? Which morphological and ecological trophic types show the most common convergence? What ecological insights into reef processes have been gained from consideration of the functional design of fish feeding mechanisms? In this chapter we explore the relationship between fish anatomy and feeding habits. Our overall goal is to show how an understanding of the functional morphology of fish feeding mechanisms can be a powerful tool when considering several ecological issues in coral reef fish biology. We have attempted to identify generalities, the major patterns that seem to cut across phylogenetic and geographic boundaries. We begin by constructing a rationale for how functional morphology can be used to enhance our insight into some long-standing ecological questions. We then review the fundamental mechanical issues associated with feeding in fishes, and the basic design features of the head that are involved in prey capture and prey processing. This sets the stage for a discussion of how the mechanical properties of fish feeding systems have been modified during reef fish diversification. With this background, we consider some of the major conclusions that have been drawn from studies of reef fish feeding ecomorphology. Because of space constraints we discuss only briefly the role of sensory modalities [...] vision, olfaction, electroreception, and hearingmbut these are also significant and diverse elements of the feeding arsenal of coral reef fishes and entire review chapters could be written on each one...|$|E
