5|$|The {{advantage}} of this re-statement is that one can exploit theorems from linear algebra on <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>number</b> of linearly independent, simultaneously perpendicular vectors.

5|$|The rank of {{a matrix}} A is <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>number</b> of linearly {{independent}} row vectors of the matrix, {{which is the}} same as <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>number</b> of linearly independent column vectors. Equivalently it is the dimension of the image of the linear map represented by A. The rank–nullity theorem states that the dimension of the kernel of a matrix plus the rank equals the number of columns of the matrix.|$|E

30|$|This {{section is}} devoted to {{investigate}} {{the performance of the}} proposed algorithm to solve medium size 0 – 1 knapsack problems. Ten instances are taken from [42], where sizes of these instances include 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70 and 75 items. The information about these instances such as dimension, parameters and optimum solution are listed in Table  3.
