40|$|Abstract—A {{complete}} circuit-level {{description of}} a representative FPGA is presented in this paper, from which a simple RC delay model {{as a function of}} architectural and technology parameters is derived. Using this model, the expression for the optimal delay of any path through the FPGA can be formulated. We distill our model into being purely architecture dependent, and use it to capture new insight into how FPGA parameters can directly affect its delay. Several applications of this model are: (1) to gain better intuition of how architecture and process parameters affect the delay path in an FPGA, (2) for initial studies into new circuit designs and integrated circuit technologies, (3) in CAD <b>tools</b> <b>for</b> <b>optimisation</b> and sensitivity analysis.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the early}} days of Systems Analysis the focus was on {{providing}} <b>tools</b> <b>for</b> <b>optimisation,</b> modelling and simulation for use by experts. Now there is a recognition of the need to develop and disseminate tools to assist in making decisions, negotiating compromises and communicating preferences that can easily be used by stakeholders without the need for specialist training. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires public participation and thus provides a strong incentive for progress in this direction. This paper places the new paradigm {{in the context of the}} classical one and discusses some of the new approaches which can be used in the implementation of the WFD. These include multi-criteria decision support methods suitable for environmental problems, adaptive management, cognitive mapping, social learning and cooperative design and group decision-making. Concordance methods (such as ELECTRE) and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) are identified as multi-criteria methods that can be readily integrated into Decision Support Systems (DSS) that deal with complex environmental issues with very many criteria, some of which are qualitative. The expanding use of the new paradigm provides an opportunity to observe and learn from the interaction of stakeholders with the new technology and to assess its effectiveness. This is best done by trained sociologists fully integrated into the processes. The WINCOMS research project is an example applied to the implementation of the WFD in Ireland...|$|E

40|$|A great {{challenge}} when conducting ex vivo studies of leukaemia is {{the construction of}} an appropriate experimental platform that would recapitulate the bone marrow (BM) environment. Such a 3 D scaffold system has been previously developed in our group [1]. Additionally to the BM architectural characteristics, parameters such as oxygen and glucose concentration are crucial as their value could differ between patients as well as within the same patient at different stages of treatment, consequently affecting the resistance of leukaemia to chemotherapy. The effect of oxidative and glucose stress-at levels close to human physiologic ones-on the proliferation and metabolic evolution of an AML model system (K- 562 cell line) in conventional 2 D cultures as well as in 3 D scaffolds were studied. We observed that the K- 562 cell line can proliferate and remain alive for 2 weeks in medium with glucose close to physiological levels both in 20 and 5 % O 2. We report interesting differences on the cellular response to the environmental, i. e., oxidative and/or nutritional stress stimuli in 2 D and 3 D. Higher adaptation to oxidative stress under non-starving conditions is observed in the 3 D system. The glucose level in the medium has more impact on the cellular proliferation in the 3 D compared to the 2 D system. These differences can be of significant importance both when applying chemotherapy in vitro and also when constructing mathematical <b>tools</b> <b>for</b> <b>optimisation</b> of disease treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{requirement of}} all building design is {{the provision of}} shelter from the external climate and, if possible, the modification of environmental factors generated by this climate to create an internal environment suitable for human comfort. The environmental design strategies of modifying climate derive from the requirements of creating human comfort in buildings, using {{the elements of the}} natural climate which vary throughout the year depending upon the prevailing climatic conditions. Environmental Building Science (EBS) research and practice has investigated various techniques to increase architects'performance in environmental building design. These technical design options are also available to architects {{to take advantage of the}} external environment. Most environmental design techniques rely on convectional forms of passive environmental design, and building material and system. But it hardly begins to address the more complex demands of environmental building design issues in the buildings. Particularly, testing environmental design techniques against physical models requires much input data which is not available in the early design stages, and is time consuming to use. This forces architects to work with many design parameters that are not compatible with their activities. It is consequently difficult to observe the interrelation of design techniques with design development. The most important role of Computer Aided Design (CAD) is to integrate wider varieties of input data requirements, modelling with EBS properties, output representations with EBS knowledge and assistance <b>tools</b> <b>for</b> <b>optimisation</b> tasks in environmental design issues...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{for the first}} time the effect of the crosstalk introduced due to laser beam imaging in a free-space optical interconnect (FSOI) system. Due to the overfill of the transmitter microlens array by the vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) beam, one part of the signal is imaged by the adjacent microlens to another channel, possibly far from the intended one. Even though this causes increase in interchannel and intersymbol interference, to our knowledge this issue has been neglected so far. The numerical simulation has been performed using a combination of exact ray tracing and the beam propagation methods. The results show that some characteristics of stray-light crosstalk are similar to that of diffraction-caused crosstalk, where it is strongly dependent on the fill factor of the microlens, array pitch, and the channel density of the system. Despite the similarities, the stray-light crosstalk does not affect by an increase in the interconnection distance. As simulation models for optical crosstalk are numerically intensive, we propose here a crosstalk behavioural model as a useful <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>optimisation</b> and design of FSOIs.
