5|$|When the no-arbitrage {{condition}} is {{satisfied with the}} use of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to exchange rate risk, interest rate parity is said to be covered. Investors will still be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the forward exchange rate sustains equilibrium such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> return on foreign deposit, thereby eliminating the potential for covered interest arbitrage profits. Furthermore, covered interest rate parity helps explain the determination of the forward exchange rate. The following equation represents covered interest rate parity.|$|E
5|$|One proof Bicentennial coin {{in silver}} clad and lacking a mint mark, similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> in the {{prototype}} set given to President Ford, is known. This piece supposedly {{came from a}} cash register drawer at the Woodward & Lothrop department store in Washington, D.C. Thomas K. DeLorey, who was then a reporter for Coin World, spoke to the discoverer and was suspicious of the story, thinking it more likely the coin was surreptitiously obtained from the government. He declined to question the origin then, fearing it might be seized and lost to the numismatic community. The piece brought almost $30,000 by private sale in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The {{devaluation}} {{caused a}} diplomatic conflict with Spain, as Duhalde {{did not allow}} the Spanish service providers to raise taxes. So far, they received their income according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> exchange rate, and intended to raise taxes to compensate their losses. The Argentine government considered {{that the effects of}} the crisis were already grave enough for the people, and further price increases would only worsen the situation. José María Aznar, prime minister of Spain, talked with Duhalde on behalf of the Spanish firms. The taxes were not raised, but Aznar stayed on good terms with Duhalde, and ratified the good relations with the country regardless of the victor of the 2003 elections.|$|E

50|$|One typical {{example is}} Thailand in 1998 Asian {{financial}} crisis. The baht was pegged at 25 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US <b>dollar</b> before <b>the</b> crisis.

25|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, Zedillo {{announced}} that his government {{would let the}} fixed exchange rate band increase 15 percent (up to 4 pesos per US$), by stopping the unorthodox measures employed by the previous administration to keep it at the previous fixed level (e.g.,by selling dollars, assuming debt, and so on). This measure, however, was not enough, and the government was unable to hold this line, and decided to let the exchange rate float. While experts agree that devaluation was necessary, some critics of Zedillo's 22-day-old administration argue that, although economically coherent, the way the crisis was handled was a political mistake. By having announced its plans for devaluation, they argue that many foreigners withdrew their investments, thus aggravating the effects.
