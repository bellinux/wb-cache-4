5|$|Reviewers {{have liked}} finding contradictions; a common complaint, however, is the games' linearity, {{as well as}} how the player {{sometimes}} has to resort to a <b>trial-and-error</b> method due to the games only accepting specific pieces of evidence, and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a specific order. Some reviewers have criticized the lack of changes to the gameplay and presentation throughout the series, while some have said that fans of the series would not have a problem with this.|$|E
5|$|Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics {{and was considered}} to be superior to its predecessor. Much of the praise went to the game's graphics, control and music, with major criticisms varying between the <b>trial-and-error</b> gameplay, lack of level variety, easy boss levels and lack of innovation. The game went on {{to become one of the}} best-selling PlayStation video games of all time and replaced its predecessor as the highest-selling Western title in Japan at the time, selling more than 800,000 units in the country by April 1998. A remastered version was included in the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy collection, released on the PlayStation 4 in June 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Bird-of-Prey's {{travel through}} time {{was one of}} the most {{difficult}} effects sequences of the film. While ILM was experienced in creating the streaking warp effect they used for previous films, the sequence required the camera to trail a sustained warp effect as the Bird-of-Prey rounded the sun. Matching the effect to the model was accomplished through <b>trial-and-error</b> guesswork. The team did not have the time to wait for the animation department to create the sun for this shot. Assistant cameraman Pete Kozachic devised a way of creating the sun on-stage. He placed two sheets of textured plexiglass next to each other and backlit them with a powerful yellow light. The rig was rotated on a circular track and the sheet in front created a moire pattern as its position shifted. Animator John Knoll added solar flare effects to complete the look; Dow recalled that the effect came close to matching footage of the sun taken by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The Clock Tower {{series has}} {{received}} mixed critical reception across its history. In retrospective reviews, the first title, Clock Tower (1995), received praise for its haunting atmosphere but {{was criticized for}} tedious puzzles and exploration. Despite these criticisms, it is considered instrumental in establishing the survival horror genre and a creating a model for future horror games to follow. Its sequel, Clock Tower (1996), was met with mixed reception as well. The horror themes and atmosphere were well received, but the game's point-and-click gameplay and slow pace {{were found to be}} inferior to the growing landscape of action games on the PlayStation, especially Capcom's first Resident Evil title, which was released the same year. The third title, Clock Tower II, was met with unfavorable reviews. Critics heavily criticized the slow point-and-click interface and the flawed <b>trial-and-error</b> gameplay. Clock Tower 3 received similar reviews to the first two titles. The graphics, atmosphere and storyline received positive reviews, but again, the gameplay was a point of criticism. Critics believed the boss fights and repetitive hiding and chasing gameplay mechanics were weak.|$|E
25|$|Robotics {{is another}} {{area that has}} {{recently}} benefited from chaos theory. Instead of robots acting in a <b>trial-and-error</b> type of refinement to interact with their environment, chaos theory {{has been used to}} build a predictive model.|$|E
25|$|A subadult male from {{a captive}} group of Guinea baboons (Papio papio) learned, by <b>trial-and-error,</b> {{to use a}} tool to rake in food. He then used the tool 104 times over 26 days, thereby {{providing}} the group with most of its food.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a genetic}} {{predisposition}} for tool {{use in this}} species, which is then refined by individual <b>trial-and-error</b> learning during a sensitive phase early in development. This means that, rather than following a stereotypical behavioural pattern, tool use can be modified and adapted by learning.|$|E
25|$|The 2nd {{failure of}} Samuel Langley's {{prototype}} plane on the Potomac has {{been attributed to}} aeroelastic effects (specifically, torsional divergence). Problems with torsional divergence plagued aircraft in the First World War, and were solved largely by <b>trial-and-error</b> and ad-hoc stiffening of the wing. In 1926, Hans Reissner published a theory of wing divergence, leading to much further theoretical research on the subject.|$|E
25|$|The first {{experimental}} antivirals {{were developed}} in the 1960s, mostly to deal with herpes viruses, and were found using traditional <b>trial-and-error</b> drug discovery methods. Researchers grew cultures of cells and infected them with the target virus. They then introduced into the cultures chemicals which they thought might inhibit viral activity, and observed whether the level of virus in the cultures rose or fell. Chemicals {{that seemed to have}} an effect were selected for closer study.|$|E
25|$|In {{people with}} keratoconus, rigid contact lenses improve vision {{by means of}} tear fluid filling {{the gap between the}} {{irregular}} corneal surface and the smooth regular inner surface of the lens, thereby creating the effect of a smoother cornea. Many specialized types of contact lenses have been developed for keratoconus, and affected people may seek out both doctors specialized in conditions of the cornea, and contact lens fitters who have experience managing people with keratoconus. The irregular cone presents a challenge and the fitter will endeavor to produce a lens with the optimal contact, stability and steepness. Some <b>trial-and-error</b> fitting may prove necessary.|$|E
25|$|If, for {{environmental}} or other reasons, a solvent or solvent blend {{is required to}} replace another of equivalent solvency, the substitution can {{be made on the}} basis of the Hansen solubility parameters of each. The values for mixtures are taken as the weighted averages of the values for the neat solvents. This can be calculated by <b>trial-and-error,</b> a spreadsheet of values, or HSP software. A 1:1 mixture of toluene and 1,4 dioxane has δD, δP and δH values of 17.8, 1.6 and 5.5, comparable to those of chloroform at 17.8, 3.1 and 5.7 respectively. Because of the health hazards associated with toluene itself, other mixtures of solvents may be found using a full HSP dataset.|$|E
25|$|In March 2006, the State Council of the People's Republic of China officially {{announced}} the first legislation directly aimed at controlling HIV/AIDS: the AIDS Prevention and Control Regulations. These regulations, {{together with the}} Five-Year Action Plan to Control HIV/AIDS (2006–2010), are {{an important step in}} the development of government policy related to the care and prevention of HIV/AIDS. Although considered bold, these regulations were passed more than 20 years after the first case of HIV infection was identified, which was recently proven. The development of a coherent policy {{was the result of a}} long and unsystematic process that involved initial missteps, said Bauer, considerable domestic and international education, debate, and trivial amounts of iterative <b>trial-and-error</b> learning. The new legislation resulted from communication and coordination among many agencies, including administrators, service providers, lobbyists, politicians, and policymakers.|$|E
25|$|Sulfonamide {{drugs were}} the first {{antibiotics}} to be used systemically, and {{paved the way for}} the antibiotic revolution in medicine. The first sulfonamide, trade-named Prontosil, was a prodrug. Experiments with Prontosil began in 1932 in the laboratories of Bayer AG, at that time a component of the huge German chemical trust IG Farben. The Bayer team believed that coal-tar dyes which are able to bind preferentially to bacteria and parasites might be used to attack harmful organisms in the body. After years of fruitless <b>trial-and-error</b> work on hundreds of dyes, a team led by physician/researcher Gerhard Domagk (working under the general direction of Farben executive Heinrich Hörlein) finally found one that worked: a red dye synthesized by Bayer chemist Josef Klarer that had remarkable effects on stopping some bacterial infections in mice. The first official communication about the breakthrough discovery was not published until 1935, more than two years after the drug was patented by Klarer and his research partner Fritz Mietzsch.|$|E
500|$|Some jumping spiders of {{the genus}} Portia hunt other spiders in ways that seem intelligent, {{outflanking}} their victims or luring them from their webs. Laboratory studies show that Portias instinctive tactics are only starting points for a <b>trial-and-error</b> approach from which these spiders learn very quickly how to overcome new prey species. However, {{they seem to be}} relatively slow [...] "thinkers", which is not surprising, as their brains are vastly smaller than those of mammalian predators.|$|E
500|$|Capcom artists {{went through}} a <b>trial-and-error</b> process {{designing}} the Tyrant creatures and their transformations. For example, the T-103 (more popularly known as [...] "Mr. X" [...] and sometimes also as [...] "Trenchcoat") was originally envisioned as armed with firearms; in some sketches {{it can be seen}} wearing a respirator and various armored outfits instead of a trenchcoat (there were also other types of coats, including a labcoat), and even its overall physical build has varied greatly (from very slim to extremely muscular). The only consistent attribute of all of the Tyrant creature variations seems to be their large, exposed beating hearts which usually serve as their only vulnerable area.|$|E
500|$|Many reviews {{also noted}} the game's high difficulty. Both Giancarlo Varanini of GameSpot and Craig Harris of IGN {{found that the}} game's bosses have very {{unpredictable}} attack patterns, thus making the battles extremely challenging. Harris additionally observed a heavy amount of <b>trial-and-error</b> for the levels themselves where the player must die several times before completing each one. He concluded, [...] " [...] It's really the way Mega Man games have always been... and to be honest, {{with all of the}} annoying little deaths in the game, there's always that sensation after every failure that you've learned the challenge, and perseverance definitely prevails in this game".|$|E
500|$|While {{the game}} {{received}} high praise overall, certain publications voiced complaints. Hatfield {{noted that the}} cutscenes had low production values, stating that [...] "they don't have the polish {{of the rest of}} the game". The reviewer for PC Gamer mentioned [...] "a few minor, yet-to-be-patched bugs". Eduardo Reboucas of Game Revolution said that [...] "a lot of the levels in Super Meat Boy depend a little too much on twitch reflexes and <b>trial-and-error</b> memorization". He also stated that [...] "there are some bits of toilet humor here and there that are duds", and that the game's high level of difficulty [...] "will make most casual players shy away". Mitchell Dyer of GamePro agreed, saying that certain [...] "absurdly difficult" [...] levels broke the flow of the game, especially in the boss levels and the later chapters.|$|E
500|$|One {{experiment}} {{designed to}} evaluate insight and problem-solving ability involved {{a piece of}} meat attached to a string hanging from a perch. To reach the food, the bird needed to stand on the perch, pull the string up a little at a time, and step on the loops to gradually shorten the string. Four of five common ravens eventually succeeded, and [...] "the transition from no success (ignoring the food or merely yanking at the string) to constant reliable access (pulling up the meat) occurred with no demonstrable <b>trial-and-error</b> learning." [...] This supports the hypothesis that common ravens are 'inventors', implying that they can solve problems. Many of the feats of common ravens were formerly argued to be stereotyped innate behaviour, but it now has been established that their aptitudes for solving problems individually and learning from each other reflect a flexible capacity for intelligent insight unusual among non-human animals.|$|E
500|$|During 1965 and 1966, Cade, {{together}} with his team of research doctors Dana Shires, James Free, and Alejandro M. de Quesada, {{conducted a series of}} <b>trial-and-error</b> experiments with his glucose-and-electrolytes rehydration drink on members of the Gators football team of coach Ray Graves, first with members of the freshman squad, and after initially promising results, with starting members of the varsity team. [...] "It didn't taste like Gatorade," [...] Cade said in a 1988 interview with Florida Trend magazine. In fact, according to Cade, when Gators lineman Larry Gagner first tried it, he spat it out and strongly suggested that the original experimental formula tasted more like bodily waste. Dana Shires remembered that [...] "it sort of tasted like toilet bowl cleaner." [...] To make it more palatable, at the suggestion of Cade's wife, the researchers added lemon juice and cyclamate to the original formula of water, salt, sodium citrate, fructose and monopotassium phosphate.|$|E
500|$|Under the {{supervision}} of the management team, the Monks conducted extensive rehearsals with a focus on gritty, rhythmically oriented music. The band equipped themselves with new instruments and hardware to achieve that goal: a Maestro fuzz box (and eventually a wah-wah pedal) for Burger, a floor tom for Johnston, and a six-string banjo for Day, the latter of which offered a disorienting counter-rhythm to the bass section. Shaw explained that the group's motivation was to possess [...] "high rhythm and high energy". He elaborated further, saying [...] "The idea of it was to get as much 'beat' out of it as we could. As much 'bam-bam-bam-bam' on the beat or whatever. The only time cymbals would be used would be for accent. If anyone wasn't contributing towards rhythm, then it wasn't part of the Monks sound". However, the band's transformation into the Monks was painstakingly slow, taking the group nearly a year of <b>trial-and-error</b> before they were confident enough to return to the studio.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{creators of}} Charlotte are Jun Maeda and Na-Ga of Key, and Charlotte {{is the second}} original anime series created by Key following Angel Beats! (2010). Hironori Toba of Aniplex approached Maeda in early 2012 with an offer from P.A.Works president Kenji Horikawa to do another anime series with the studio. Maeda was surprised by this, as he never expected to work with P.A.Works again. Horikawa explained that the production staff could now handle things that {{were not able to}} be fully materialized during the production of Angel Beats!. Maeda did not think he would ever be involved in the planning of another anime series, but {{he said that he had}} no choice but to accept Horikawa's offer after discussing it with him. Toba asked Maeda to write a [...] "Key-like story", and Maeda started out by applying his prior experience of working on Angel Beats!. He went through a <b>trial-and-error</b> process to work out what kind of setting and story would work well for an anime series.|$|E
500|$|Unlike most action games, stealth games {{challenge}} the player to avoid alerting enemies altogether. The core gameplay {{elements of the}} modern stealth game are to avoid combat, minimize noise, and strike enemies from the shadows. Completing objectives without being detected by any enemy, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "ghosting" [...] is a common approach to stealth games. Avoiding detection may {{be the only way to}} successfully complete a game, but there are usually multiple ways to achieve a goal with different pathways or styles of play. Players can hide behind objects or in shadows, and can strike or run past an enemy when the enemy is facing the other way. If the player attracts the attention of enemies, they usually must hide and wait until the enemies abandon their search. Thus, planning becomes important, as does <b>trial-and-error.</b> However, some stealth games put more emphasis on physical combat skill when the player is spotted. Some games offer a choice between killing or merely knocking out an enemy. When ghosting is optional, or even not well-supported by a game, players may still attempt to avoid combat for moral reasons or as a demonstration of skill.|$|E
500|$|Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex {{received}} mixed to favourable reviews, {{with some}} critics criticizing {{the game for}} making little changes to the formula established by its predecessors. Louis Bedigian of GameZone wrote a positive review, saying that [...] "any Crash Bandicoot fan would be a fool not {{to go out and}} buy this game. I started playing at 2am one night and did not stop until three in the afternoon!" [...] Doug Perry of IGN described the game as [...] "a decent-playing and pretty-looking Crash Bandicoot game. It's nothing terribly special, but it's not bad, not bad at all." [...] Official US PlayStation Magazine felt that [...] "when the strongest feeling I get from a game is the desire to play its predecessors, something's not quite right." [...] Game Informer criticized the [...] "outrageously bad load times", saying that they [...] "keep the game from being average." [...] Star Dingo of GamePro cautioned that [...] "if you were hoping the new management would give Crash a big kick in the pants, however, this is one pair of pants you will find quite unkicked." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly criticised the <b>trial-and-error</b> gameplay, saying that [...] "when forced to blindly jump, die, then discover what you missed, where I come from, that’s just cheating." ...|$|E
500|$|Aware of the {{potential}} for controversy, Liszt wrote, [...] "The barometer is hardly set on praise for me at the moment. I expect quite a hard downpour of rain when the symphonic poems appear." [...] Joseph Joachim, who in his time in Weimar had found Liszt's workshop rehearsals and the <b>trial-and-error</b> process practiced in them to be wearisome, was dismayed at what he considered their lack of creativity. Vienna music critic Eduard Hanslick found even the term [...] "Sinfonische Dichtung" [...] contradictory and offensive; he wrote against them with vehemence after he had heard only one, Les préludes. Surgeon Theodor Billroth, who was also a musical friend of Brahms, wrote of them, [...] "This morning [...] and Kirchner played the Symphonic Poems (sic) of Liszt on two pianos ... music of hell, and can't even be called musictoilet paper music! I finally vetoed Liszt on medical grounds and we purged ourselves with Brahms's [...] G Major String Sextet." [...] Wagner was more receptive; he agreed with the idea of the unity of the arts that Liszt espoused and wrote as much in his [...] "Open Letter on Liszt's Symphonic Poems". Walker considers this letter seminal in the War of the Romantics: ...|$|E
500|$|The game's mission design {{received}} mixed reviews. Martin {{criticized the}} limited geographical variety of each level, but Welsh applauded the map variety, adding that each level feels different, as ideas were never identical. He further praised the game's portrayal of nature, describing it as [...] "elegantly expressed". Gonzalez {{added that the}} game's variety was sufficient, and is successful in keeping the game interesting. Some critics criticized the game's difficulty curve, and added that the later levels can be frustrating as they are significantly more challenging and demand high levels of time management. Winterhalter however, criticized {{the first half of}} the game, calling it a [...] "tutorial" [...] that must be endured before reaching the better missions, while describing the latter half as addictive. Justin McElroy from Joystiq added that the natural disasters featured are way too unpredictable, and lamented that the game had failed to provide players enough clues when the player failed and destroyed the entire tribe. Tom Francis of PC Gamer echoed similar statements, that the game seldom notified players of their mistakes, and that levels are excessively <b>trial-and-error</b> and feel too stressful for players to play. Jamin Smith of VideoGamer.com criticized the mission structure and objectives for being unrewarding and lacking a sense of progression.|$|E
500|$|Minor criticisms varied amongst critics. Broady {{noted that}} the semi-3D setup is [...] "sometimes hard to navigate" [...] and {{elaborated}} that [...] "you'll find yourself missing jumps because you're unable to judge distances properly." [...] Additionally, he criticized the <b>trial-and-error</b> aspect of the gameplay as [...] "just plain cheap" [...] and stated that [...] "in some areas you must sacrifice many lives until you memorize a level's layout." [...] The IGN staff said that the level design [...] "isn't as varied as it could be" [...] and added that the [...] "jungle, snow and water" [...] environments are recycled from the previous game and reused multiple times in Cortex Strikes Back. They also described the boss levels as [...] "insultingly easy". Cooke observed that, like its predecessor, the game did not add anything to the genre and summarized that [...] "the first Crash was dauntingly similar to the 16-bit platform games of yester-yore, only with better graphics, and Crash 2 doesn't deviate much from this formula." [...] He also described the [...] "bizarre" [...] lenticular 3D cover art of the game as [...] "unnecessary and evil" [...] and [...] "a device of unprecedented agony", claiming to have contracted a massive headache after [...] "looking at it in [...] car for about 15 seconds".|$|E
500|$|Some {{aspects of}} the game still {{received}} criticism. Several publications {{did not agree with}} the positive reception of the story; Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com noted that while Mysts lack of interaction and continual plot suited the game, it helped usher in the death of the adventure game genre. Edge stated the main flaw with the game was that the game engine was nowhere near as sophisticated as the graphics. Heidi Fournier of Adventure Gamers noted a few critics complained about the difficulty and lack of context of the puzzles, while others believed these elements added to the gameplay. Similarly, critics were split on whether the lack of a plot the player could actually change was a good or bad element. In 1996 Next Generation called it [...] "gaming's bleakest hour", saying the static graphics and purely <b>trial-and-error</b> puzzles epitomized poor game design. They said Mysts commercial success, which they owed chiefly to its popularity among non-gamers as a CD-ROM showcase, had led to many other games emulating its negative aspects. In a 2000 retrospective review, IGN declared that Myst had not aged well and that playing it [...] "was like watching hit TV shows from the 70s. 'People watched that?,' you wonder in horror." ...|$|E
500|$|Developing the {{gameplay}} {{began at}} the start of development, with a test environment being built to develop and refine the basics of the battle system. Work within the test build spanned approximately one and a half years. While creating the battle system, the staff decided that the key words should be [...] "order" [...] and [...] "chaos": whoever gained order on the battlefield would be the victor. One of the concepts that emerged from this was Gathering, Zael's ability to direct all enemies' attention towards him. At first, Gathering ended up generating an unwanted amount of chaos on the battlefield, and this resulted in the <b>trial-and-error</b> period for it running on for a long time. The biggest challenge, once the concept had been finalized, was adjusting its effectiveness on the battlefield depending on the situation and enemy types. A concept that did not make it into the final game was [...] "Replay": after an enemy successfully cast a spell, players could rewatch the last few seconds of battle from an overhead view to see what type it was and take that into their strategy. This slowed the pace of combat down too much, so the concept was entirely removed. Hangovers of it include the ability to freeze time during certain actions, and the overhead perspective when commanding party members The cover system was designed around the limitations of the camera control born from the Wii Remote's control scheme.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Milton Guasti under the pseudonym DoctorM64 {{over the course of}} about ten years, although with several periods of no work done on the game. Guasti created the game with the intention of recreating the fast pace of Metroid: Zero Mission gameplay, and the [...] "atmosphere and solitude" [...] of Super Metroid. After having finished Metroid II for the first time, he imagined it to be [...] "cool" [...] to play the game with modern gameplay, an in-game minimap rather than with a physical map on one's lap, and the Omega Metroids being as tall as the screen. As Guasti was not yet a programmer at the time, he used a <b>trial-and-error</b> method to modify a platforming game engine by Martin Piecyk within the game creation system , with learning being his main motivation for working on the game. At first the remake followed the original Metroid II map layout and already existing sprites from Metroid: Zero Mission and Super Metroid. As Guasti kept working on the game engine and polished each ability, he felt that AM2R started to seem more and more authentic. After the game had been made public, several artists contacted Guasti and volunteered to create original art for the game: the Metroid evolutions were redesigned, and new enemies and areas unrelated to other Metroid games were added. He remade the music himself while waiting for customers in his recording studio.|$|E
500|$|Part of this {{creative}} experimentation was a <b>trial-and-error</b> approach. Liszt constructed compositions {{with varying}} sections of music not necessarily having distinct beginnings and ends. He sketched sections, sometimes without fully completing them, {{on a small}} number of staves with some indication of the orchestration. After an assistantAugust Conradi from 1848 to 1849, Joachim Raff from 1850 to 1853had realized Liszt's ideas and provided a score of an acceptable standard, Liszt would then make further revisions; he moved sections to form different structural relationships, and modified connective materials or composed them anew, completing the piece of music. The score was copied, then tried out in rehearsals with the Weimarian Court orchestra and further changes made in the light of practical experience. Many years later, Liszt reminisced how his compositional development hinged on hearing an orchestra perform his works: [...] "I needed to hear them in order {{to get an idea of}} them." [...] He added that it was much more for this reason, and not simply for securing a public for his own works, that he promoted them in Weimar and elsewhere. After many such stages of composition, rehearsal and revision, Liszt might reach a version where the musical form seemed balanced and he was satisfied. However, it was his habit to write modifications to already printed scores. From his perspective, his compositions remained [...] "works in progress" [...] as he continued to reshape, rework, or add and subtract material. In some instances, a composition could exist in four or five versions simultaneously.|$|E
500|$|The initial {{concepts}} for The Last Story came to Hironobu Sakaguchi {{after his}} departure from Square (now Square Enix) in 2003. After a period working on games {{at his new}} studio Mistwalker, Sakaguchi realized that his style of game were not in tune with current gaming trends. Later, he elaborated that The Last Story was primarily born from reflecting on the design mistakes he made during the development of Blue Dragon (2006) and Lost Odyssey (2007): while they tried to innovate with the story, they kept the gameplay very traditional. Sakaguchi drew up a design document for the game, and around that time met up with Takuya Matsumoto, a designer from AQ Interactive {{who had worked with}} Sakaguchi on Blue Dragon. They both realized that they held the same views on what was holding their games back in the current market, and decided to collaborate on the game with the goal of creating something new. In an interview with IGN, Sakaguchi said that development took three years: the first year was devoted to a <b>trial-and-error</b> development process devoted to the battle system. A longer development time of four years was reported by Matsumoto in a different interview with Gamasutra. According to Matsumoto, the team leads went to the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) each year and were assured that their game was in-step with current gameplay trends. Production of The Last Story was a collaboration between Mistwalker, AQ Interactive and Nintendo, and was Sakaguchi's first work as a director since Final Fantasy V (1992). The game was going through its final development stages by April 2010, and according to Sakaguchi was [...] "complete" [...] by December that year.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} was {{the second}} element created for the game, following the graphics created by Jensen. The gameplay was created and refined using rudimentary graphic elements to establish the types of puzzles they wanted to have, but aware of how these elements would {{be presented to the}} player in the released version. Limbo was designed to avoid the pitfalls of major titles, where the same gameplay mechanic is used repeatedly. Carlsen, initially brought aboard as a programmer for the custom game engine, became the lead designer after Playdead found him to be capable at creating puzzles. Carlsen stated that the puzzles within Limbo were designed to [...] " [...] you guessing all the way through". Jensen also wanted to make the puzzles feel like a natural part of the environment, and to avoid the feeling that the player was simply moving from puzzle to puzzle through the course of the game. Carlsen identified examples of puzzles from other games that he wanted to avoid. He wanted to avoid simple puzzles that gave the player little satisfaction in its solution, such as a puzzle in [...] that involved simply moving a sun-lit mirror to specific points in a room. In contrast, Carlsen wanted to avoid making the puzzle so complex with many separate parts that the player would resort to <b>trial-and-error</b> and eventually come out with the solution without thinking about why the solution worked; Carlsen used an example of a puzzle from the 2008 Prince of Persia game that had seven different mechanics that he never bothered to figure out himself. Carlsen designed Limbo puzzles to fall between these limits, demonstrating one puzzle that only has three elements: a switch panel, an electrified floor, and a chain; the goal—to use the chain to cross the electrified floor—is immediately obvious to the player, and then tasks the player to determine the right combination of moves and timing to complete it safely. They often had to strip away elements to make the puzzles more enjoyable and easier to figure out. The decision to provide little information to the player was an initial challenge in creating the game. From their initial pool of about 150 playtesters, several would have no idea of how to solve certain puzzles. To improve this, they created scenarios before troublesome spots that highlighted the appropriate actions; for example, when they found players did not think about pulling a boat onto shore to use as a platform to reach a higher ledge, they presented the player with a box-pulling puzzle earlier to demonstrate the pulling mechanics.|$|E

These teachings from Ajaan Lee correspond to the factors of the first jhana known as directed-thought (Pali: [...] "vitakka"), and evaluation (Pali: [...] "vicara").|$|E
