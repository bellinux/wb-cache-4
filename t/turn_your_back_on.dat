500|$|Those within TNA held strong {{negative}} feelings toward Hall for missing the event; many felt {{he should have}} at least tried {{to make it to the}} show. Dixie Carter was upset at Joe's comments prior to the main event, believing Joe tried to go [...] "into business for himself." [...] Chris Sokol's wrote in his review: [...] "The old saying was, 'Don't <b>turn</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the Wolfpack.' However, thats just what Scott Hall did when he decided to no-show his TNA PPV return." ...|$|E
500|$|Alf made no real {{attempt to}} contact John {{again until the}} height of Beatlemania (claiming {{he did not know}} who the Beatles were). He was working as a kitchen porter at the Greyhound Hotel at Hampton Court, in Middlesex, when someone pointed out a {{photograph}} of John Lennon in a newspaper and asked whether he was related to him. Alfred and Charlie visited one of the Beatles' Christmas shows at the Finsbury Park Empire in London. When the Beatles were filming a scene for A Hard Day's Night in the Scala Theatre in Soho in April 1964, Alf walked into Brian Epstein's NEMS office in Argyle Street with a journalist. [...] "I'm John Lennon's father", he explained to the receptionist. When Epstein was informed, he [...] "went into a panic", and immediately sent a car to bring John to NEMS office. Alf was shabbily dressed, with his unkempt, thinning grey hair greased back. He stuck out his hand, but John did not take it, saying [...] "What do you want?". Alf placated John somewhat by saying, [...] "You can't <b>turn</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> your family, no matter what they've done." [...] Their conversation did not last long, as John soon ordered Alf and the journalist out of the NEMS office. The Beatles' personal stories were kept out of the newspapers—by agreement with journalists who were offered exclusive stories in return—but one day John opened a copy of the Daily Express and saw a photo of his father.|$|E

Hits such as [...] "This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us", [...] "Amateur Hour" [...] and [...] "Never <b>Turn</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Back</b> <b>on</b> Mother Earth" [...] led to many appearances on the BBC's flagship music show Top of the Pops.

Why should I sit and moan about good roles eluding me? You {{need to learn to}} <b>turn</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the scene that doesn't suit you," [...] she later explained in an interview, speaking also of how relieved she felt at having dropped this 'everlasting worry' about the need of being continuously in demand.|$|E

2500|$|Peter Hook of New Order cited Giorgio Moroder's {{production}} on [...] "The Number One Song in Heaven" [...] {{as a major}} influence when his band changed of musical style to produce electro/dance rock songs like [...] "Temptation" [...] in 1982. New Order also delivered an extended live version of [...] "When I'm With You" [...] that same year in Milano. When they started playing music, singer Dave Gahan. and composer Martin Gore, of Depeche Mode cited them {{as one of their}} favorite bands.

Other early electronic acts like the Human League, and Erasure, also mentioned the group. Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran stated about [...] "This Town ain't...": [...] "There was something about them that was very different. I was immediately fascinated with that song." ...|$|E
2500|$|DeShannon's biggest break came in February 1964 {{when she}} {{supported}} The Beatles {{on their first}} US tour, and formed a touring band with guitarist Ry Cooder. DeShannon co-wrote [...] "Breakaway" [...] with Sharon Sheeley, which was recorded by Irma Thomas in 1964, and by Tracey Ullman in 1983. She also wrote [...] "Don't Doubt Yourself Babe" [...] for Mr. Tambourine Man, the 1965 debut album of The Byrds. Her music at this stage was heavily influenced by the American West Coast sounds and folk music. Staying briefly in England in 1965, DeShannon formed a songwriting partnership with Jimmy Page, {{which resulted in the}} songs [...] "Dream Boy" [...] and [...] "Don't <b>Turn</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Back</b> <b>on</b> Me". DeShannon also wrote material for singer Marianne Faithfull, including her Top Ten UK and US hit [...] "Come and Stay With Me", which became Faithfull's biggest UK hit, peaking at #4 in 1965. [...] That same year, Cher covered the song on her solo debut album All I Really Want to Do. [...] It would be three more years before Jackie DeShannon would record the song for herself, on her 'Laurel Canyon' album in 1968. [...] She also appeared on the television show Ready Steady Go! ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{maintain}} a philosophical balance, {{the argument for}} [...] "raw feels" [...] needs to be set {{side by side with}} the claim above. Viewing sensations as [...] "raw feels" [...] implies that initially they have not yet—to carry on the metaphor—been [...] "cooked", that is, unified into [...] "things" [...] and [...] "persons", which is something the mind does after the sensation has responded to the blank input, that response driven by motivation, that is, initially by pain and pleasure, and subsequently, when memories have been implanted, by desire and fear. Such a [...] "raw-feel" [...] state has been more formally identified as [...] "non-epistemic". In support of this view, the theorists cite a range of empirical facts. The following can be taken as representative. There are brain-damaged persons, known as [...] "agnosics" [...] (literally [...] "not-knowing") who still have vivid visual sensations but are quite unable to identify any entity before them, including parts of their own body. There is also the similar predicament of persons, formerly blind, who are given sight for the first time—and consider what it is a newborn baby must experience. A German psychologist of the 19th century, Hermann von Helmholtz, proposed a simple experiment to demonstrate the non-epistemic nature of qualia: his instructions were to stand in front of a familiar landscape, <b>turn</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> it, bend down and look at the landscape between your legs—you will find it difficult in the upside-down view to recognize what you found familiar before.|$|E
50|$|Frontman Brian Molko said on {{the concept}} of the album:We've made a record about {{choosing}} life, about choosing to live, about stepping out of the darkness and into the light.
