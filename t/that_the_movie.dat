Author Jason Epstein commented <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> gives the impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case. Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.|$|E

Leela Naidu's 2010 book with Jerry Pinto indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> screenplay was written before the Nanavati case.
