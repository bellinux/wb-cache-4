30|$|The known <b>thermophilic</b> <b>fungi</b> {{are either}} ascomycetes {{belonging}} to the orders Sordariales, Eurotiales, and Onygenales or zygomycetes of the order Mucorales (Berka et al. 2011; Morgenstern et al. 2012). These organisms are the only described eukaryotes that can grow at temperatures above 45 °C. In nature, <b>thermophilic</b> <b>fungi</b> are typically found in compost, wood chip piles, stored grains, animal dung and other environments that are self-heating due to degradation of plant materials (Johri et al. 1999). Although such material often contains high concentrations of cellulose some <b>thermophilic</b> <b>fungi</b> are poor cellulose-degraders and seem to utilize sugars released by cellulolytic species in the biotope (Maheshwari et al. 2000). Therefore, <b>thermophilic</b> <b>fungi</b> can differ greatly in their cellulolytic potential.|$|R
40|$|<b>Thermophilic</b> <b>fungi</b> {{are a small}} {{assemblage}} in mycota {{that have}} a minimum temperature of growth at or above 20 °C and a maximum temperature of growth extending up to 60 to 62 °C. As the only representatives of eukaryotic organisms that can grow at temperatures above 45 °C, the <b>thermophilic</b> <b>fungi</b> are valuable experimental systems for investigations of mechanisms that allow growth at moderately high temperature yet limit their growth beyond 60 to 62 °C. Although widespread in terrestrial habitats, they have remained underexplored compared to thermophilic species of eubacteria and archaea. However, <b>thermophilic</b> <b>fungi</b> are potential sources of enzymes with scientific and commercial interests. This review, for the first time, compiles information on the physiology and enzymes of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>fungi.</b> <b>Thermophilic</b> <b>fungi</b> can be grown in minimal media with metabolic rates and growth yields {{comparable to those of}} mesophilic fungi. Studies of their growth kinetics, respiration, mixed-substrate utilization, nutrient uptake, and protein breakdown rate have provided some basic information not only on <b>thermophilic</b> <b>fungi</b> but also on filamentous fungi in general. Some species have the ability to grow at ambient temperatures if cultures are initiated with germinated spores or mycelial inoculum or if a nutritionally rich medium is used. <b>Thermophilic</b> <b>fungi</b> have a powerful ability to degrade polysaccharide constituents of biomass. The properties of their enzymes show differences not only among species but also among strains of the same species. Their extracellular enzymes display temperature optima for activity that are close to or above the optimum temperature for the growth of organism and, in general, are more heat stable than those of the mesophilic fungi. Some extracellular enzymes from <b>thermophilic</b> <b>fungi</b> are being produced commercially, and a few others have commercial prospects. Genes of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>fungi</b> encoding lipase, protease, xylanase, and cellulase have been cloned and overexpressed in heterologous fungi, and pure crystalline proteins have been obtained for elucidation of the mechanisms of their intrinsic thermostability and catalysis. By contrast, the thermal stability of the few intracellular enzymes that have been purified is comparable to or, in some cases, lower than that of enzymes from the mesophilic fungi. Although rigorous data are lacking, it appears that eukaryotic thermophily involves several mechanisms of stabilization of enzymes or optimization of their activity, with different mechanisms operating for different enzymes...|$|R

40|$|Extensive {{research}} has been compiled on mycotoxin production by mesophilic fungi. However, toxin production by the <b>thermophilic</b> <b>fungi</b> has only slightly been explored. In 1970 Sister Donovan of this laboratory hinted {{at the possibility of}} mycotoxin production in thermophiles when she demonstrated that extracts of Fenicillium duponti were toxic towards brine shrimp (Artemia,salina). <b>Thermophilic</b> <b>fungi</b> from natural composting substrates and from existing laboratory stock cultures were investigated to determine the possibility of mycotoxin production by <b>thermophilic</b> <b>fungi.</b> Three bioassay organisms were used to test the toxicity of the <b>thermophilic</b> <b>fungi</b> extracts. Sixteen of the 16 thermophiles reduced brine shrimp viability by more than 25 % over controls. Ten of the 16 thermophiles produced toxic substances at each of three fungal incubation temperatures. Germinating Bacillus megatherium spores were found sensitive to extracts of 9 of the 16 thermophiles. Five of the nine thermophiles produced bacterial toxic substances at each of three fungal incubation temperatures. All embryos exposed to the thermophilic extracts lived and developed normally showing no sign of somatic deformities upon opening the eggs. One-day-old hatched chicks were then investigated. Sixteen of the 48 chicks injected with thermophilic extracts manifested viscerallesions of the heart, liver and stomach on autopsy seven days after injection. Results of three bioassays indicate that the toxic secondary metabolites were found to be present in crude extracts of 16 <b>thermophilic</b> <b>fungi.</b> Data indicated that many of the thermophiles produced toxic substances at each of three incubation temperatures.

30|$|Elucidation of fungal biomass {{degradation}} {{is important}} for understanding the turnover of biological materials in nature and {{has important implications for}} industrial biomass conversion. In recent years there has been an increasing interest in elucidating the biological role of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>fungi</b> and in characterization of their industrially useful enzymes. In the present study we investigated the cellulolytic potential of 16 <b>thermophilic</b> <b>fungi</b> from the three ascomycete orders Sordariales, Eurotiales and Onygenales and from the zygomycete order Mucorales thus covering all fungal orders that include thermophiles. <b>Thermophilic</b> <b>fungi</b> are the only described eukaryotes that can grow at temperatures above 45 °C. All 16 fungi were able to grow on crystalline cellulose but their secreted enzymes showed widely different cellulolytic activities, pH optima and thermostabilities. Interestingly, in contrast to previous reports, we found that some fungi such as Melanocarpus albomyces readily grew on crystalline cellulose and produced cellulases. These results indicate that there are large differences in the cellulolytic potential of different isolates of the same species. Furthermore, all the selected species were able to degrade cellulose but the differences in cellulolytic potential and thermostability of the secretome did not correlate to the taxonomic position. PCR amplification and sequencing of 22 cellulase genes from the fungi showed that the level of thermostability of the cellulose-degrading activity could not be inferred from the phylogenetic relationship of the cellulases.|$|R

40|$|This book, {{written by}} two {{distinguished}} American mycologists, provides an elaborate {{account of the}} morphology and biology of all known <b>thermophilic</b> <b>fungi.</b> The authors {{do this in a}} most readable form. The book is divided into three parts. Part I includes a brief introduction and a description of the methods used for the isolation and maintenance of thermophiles. More than half of the book consists of Part II, that deals with the occurrence, morphology, cultural characteristics, taxonomy and temperature relations of the investigated fungi. Fifteen taxa are described, including four new species and three new varieties of existing species. A short diagnosis is given of every described species. Illustrations in the form of good line drawings are provided for all species. Macroscopic features of three species are illustrated by excellent colour plates. Part III is devoted to general biology and practical importance of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>fungi.</b> While this book was in the press, several new reports of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>fungi</b> {{came to the attention of}} the authors. A short account of these fungi with their references is given in the Addenda. There are a few debatable points in this very useful monograph, especially in the chapters dealing with taxonomy and nomenclature. For instance it seems rather doubtful to me that the fungus described as Torula thermophila really belongs to Torula. In the description of Thermoascus thermophilus two different species are mixed up. For the perfect stage of Penicillium duponti the authors use erroneously the invalid name Talaromyces duponti (Griffon et Maublanc) Apinis. Nevertheless this is a most notable book. Its greatest value, however, lies in the very clear descriptions, while the many references at the end of the book make this an excellent reference book. The treatment is a practical and useful one.
