5|$|At the {{transport}} layer, most communication adopts either the <b>Transmission</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Protocol</b> (TCP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP is used {{when it is}} essential every message sent is received by the other computer whereas UDP is used when it is merely desirable. With TCP, packets are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers. With UDP, packets are not ordered or retransmitted if lost. Both TCP and UDP packets carry port numbers with them to specify what application or process the packet should be handled by. Because certain application-level protocols use certain ports, network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements. Examples are to restrict Internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning priority.|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{majority}} of trac {{on the current}} Internet uses <b>Transmission</b> <b>Controls</b> <b>Protocol</b> (TCP) based transport. Engineering the access, core and backbone networks that constitute the Internet therefore requires the development of accurate analytic models of TCP performance. While analytic models employ {{a greater degree of}} abstraction than simulation models, they are better suited to support engineering tasks such as network design, capacity planning, and setting operational thresholds. These require the evaluation {{of a wide range of}} scenarios covering many parameter dimensions, which would imply excessive run times with a detailed simulation model. A crucial component of the <b>Transmission</b> <b>Controls</b> <b>Protocol</b> (TCP) is the dynamic window ow control designed (by Van Jacobson) to prevent congestion collapses such as that which crippled the Internet in October 1986. Given the complexity of TCP window and timer dynamics, one might conclude that analytical models of TCP performan...|$|R

Some resolver implementations use TCP for all queries.|$|E
25|$|The Internet {{protocol}} suite is the conceptual model and set of communications protocols {{used on the}} Internet and similar computer networks. It {{is commonly known as}} TCP/IP because the foundational protocols in the suite are the <b>Transmission</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Protocol</b> (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). It is occasionally known as the Department of Defense (DoD) model, because the development of the networking method was funded by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA.|$|E
25|$|Real-time {{multimedia}} streaming applications require timely {{delivery of}} information and often can tolerate some packet loss to achieve this goal. For example, loss of a packet in audio application may result in loss of {{a fraction of a}} second of audio data, which can be made unnoticeable with suitable error concealment algorithms. The <b>Transmission</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Protocol</b> (TCP), although standardized for RTP use, is not normally used in RTP applications because TCP favors reliability over timeliness. Instead the majority of the RTP implementations are built on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Other transport protocols specifically designed for multimedia sessions are SCTP and DCCP, although, , they are not in widespread use.|$|E

2500|$|The Internet {{protocol}} suite does not presume any specific hardware or software environment. [...] It only requires that hardware and a software layer exists that {{is capable of}} sending and receiving packets on a computer network. As a result, the suite has been implemented on essentially every computing platform. A minimal implementation of TCP/IP includes the following: Internet Protocol (IP), Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), <b>Transmission</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Protocol</b> (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). In addition to IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, Internet Protocol version 6 requires Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), ICMPv6, and IGMPv6 and is often accompanied by an integrated IPSec security layer.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, the TCP managed both {{datagram}} transmissions and routing, but as {{the protocol}} grew, other researchers recommended a division of functionality into protocol layers. [...] Advocates included Jonathan Postel of the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute, who edited the Request for Comments (RFCs), the technical and strategic document series that has both documented and catalyzed Internet development. Postel stated, [...] "We are screwing up in our design of Internet protocols by violating the principle of layering." [...] Encapsulation of different mechanisms was intended {{to create an environment}} where the upper layers could access only what was needed from the lower layers. A monolithic design would be inflexible and lead to scalability issues. The Transmission Control Program was split into two distinct protocols, the <b>Transmission</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Protocol</b> and the Internet Protocol.|$|E

2500|$|Not to be {{confused}} with a separate application known as the World wide web which was invented much later in the early 1990s (see article on the English inventor Tim Berners-Lee), the Internet is the global system of overall interconnected computer networks that use the standardized Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of millions of private and public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope that are linked by copper wires, fiber-optic cables, wireless connections, and other technologies. The concept of packet switching of a network was first explored by Paul Baran in the early 1960s, and the mathematical formulations behind packet switching were later devised by Leonard Kleinrock. On October 29, 1969, the world's first electronic computer network, the ARPANET, was established between nodes at Leonard Kleinrock's lab at UCLA and Douglas Engelbart's lab at the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International). Another milestone occurred in 1973 when Bob Kahn and Vinton Cerf co-invented Internet Protocol and <b>Transmission</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Protocol</b> while working on ARPANET at the United States Department of Defense. The first TCP/IP-wide area network was operational on January 1, 1983, when the United States' National Science Foundation (NSF) constructed the university network backbone that would later become the NSFNet. This date is held as the [...] "birth" [...] of the Internet.|$|E
