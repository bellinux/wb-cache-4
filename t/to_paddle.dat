5|$|It is {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>paddle</b> on much of Catawissa Creek for {{parts of the}} year. However, it is not usually possible <b>to</b> <b>paddle</b> on the creek during the summer. Upstream of Mainville, there are some riffles and small rapids. There is a larger rapid downstream of a lowdam in the lower reaches of the creek.|$|E
5|$|While ducks are {{naturally}} aquatic, swimming {{can be dangerous}} to young ducklings, and it can also restrict a duck's growth. Thus, although duckers would ensure the ducklings always had a trough or sink <b>to</b> <b>paddle</b> in, the ducklings would be kept away from bodies of water while they were growing. The exception was shortly before slaughter, when the ducklings would be taken for one swim in a pond, as it helped them to feather properly.|$|E
5|$|Larry Vaughn {{arrives at}} the Brody house before Brody returns home, and informs Ellen {{that he and his}} wife are leaving Amity. Before he leaves, he tells Ellen that he always thought they would have made a great couple. When Brody and Quint return to sea the {{following}} day, the shark starts ramming the boat, but Quint is able to harpoon it several times. The shark leaps out of the water and onto the stern of the Orca, ripping a huge hole in the aft section and causing the boat to begin to sink. Quint plunges another harpoon into the shark, but as it falls back into the water, his foot gets entangled in the rope, and he is dragged underwater to his death as he drowns. Brody, now floating on a seat cushion, spots the shark swimming towards him and prepares for his death. However, just as the shark gets within a few feet of him, it succumbs to its many wounds, rolls over in the water, and dies before it can kill Brody. The great fish sinks down out of sight, dragging Quint's still entangled body behind it. Brody manages <b>to</b> <b>paddle</b> back to shore on his makeshift float, the lone survivor of the ordeal.|$|E

5|$|The frogs {{may move}} up to 100m during amplexus before the female lays her eggs. During the laying of the eggs, the pair of frogs remain in amplexus and the male is assumed to {{fertilise}} the eggs with his sperm. Males are also seen <b>to</b> <b>paddle</b> their rear legs during this time, which is speculated to accelerate fertilisation. The egg-laying and fertilisation process takes around five minutes. An average of 5,000 eggs are deposited amongst aquatic vegetation in a gelatinous mass; however, a clump of 11,682 has been recorded. The female moves around while depositing, {{leaving a trail of}} eggs that sometimes entangles upon itself. Initially, the mass floats, but sinks up to 12 hours after laying, or when disturbed. The eggs are distinct from those of other frog species; they are 2–2.5mm wide upon deposition and are bicoloured, black at one end and white at the other. They immediately begin to expand, quickly reaching around 4mm across, before sinking. When first laid, they float with the black pointing up, but after sinking, the orientation becomes disordered. Two to five days later, the tadpoles hatch out, but the process can take only a few hours on occasions. The hatching rate varies between 46 and 77%, and peaks at 22°C. Hatching is less likely in acidic waters, although alkaline conditions do not lead to a lower rate compared to neutral conditions. Given the large number of eggs that hatch per female and given the scarcity of mature frogs, tadpole survival rates are believed to be very low.|$|E
5|$|The lack of patrolling by MacGregor's troops {{allowed the}} Spanish to march {{straight}} into Porto Bello early on 30 April 1819. MacGregor {{was still in}} bed when the Spaniards found his riflemen drilling in the main square and opened fire. Awoken by the noise, MacGregor threw his bed and blankets from the window onto the beach below and jumped out after them, then attempted <b>to</b> <b>paddle</b> out to his ships on a log. He passed out and would probably have drowned {{had he not been}} picked up and brought aboard the Hero by one of his naval officers. MacGregor would claim that on regaining consciousness he immediately raised his standard over the Hero, then despatched runners to Rafter ordering him not to surrender. The version of events favoured by Sinclair is that Rafter received orders to this effect only after he had himself contacted MacGregor on the Hero. Rafter, in the fort with 200 men, kept up a steady barrage and waited for his commander to fire on the royalists from the ships—but to the colonel's astonishment MacGregor instead ordered his fleet to turn about and made for the high seas. Abandoned, Colonel Rafter and the remnants of MacGregor's army {{had no choice but to}} surrender; most of the surviving officers and troops entered miserable existences in captivity. Rafter was ultimately shot with 11 other officers for conspiring to escape.|$|E
25|$|Trys Morris and Bob Timms have {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>paddle</b> from UK to Australia 1999 & 2000, abandoning the expedition in Athens, Greece {{due to lack}} of funds and visas for Arabian countries.|$|E
50|$|People {{have also}} taken quite a liking <b>to</b> <b>paddling</b> down the river. It is Michigan's second largest river {{only to the}} Grand River. It is {{surprisingly}} quite slow, making it perfect for beginners learning in either a kayak or canoe.|$|R
5000|$|A kayak with pedals {{allows the}} kayaker to propel the vessel with a {{rotating}} propeller or underwater [...] "flippers" [...] {{rather than with}} a <b>paddle.</b> In contrast <b>to</b> <b>paddling,</b> kayakers who pedal kayaks use their legs rather than their arms.|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{stations}} were named, and had nameboards, tickets {{in the early}} years at least were more prosaic, bearing the words [...] "Pumping Station <b>to</b> <b>Paddling</b> Pool", and vice versa.

25|$|Anyone {{travelling}} to or {{from the}} Islands would originally have travelled on a trading vessel, faster sailing ships designed to carry the post and passengers were introduced before paddle steamers began to arrive in the 1820s, forcing the post to change <b>to</b> <b>paddle</b> steamer, even so it went bankrupt in 1836 This was followed in 1850 with iron screw steamers, with the first SS Sarnia and SS Caesarea operating, {{but only for a}} few months.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Europeans, the land north of the East River was {{occupied}} by the Siwanoys, one of many groups of Algonquin-speaking Lenapes in the area. Those of the Lenapes who lived {{in the northern part of}} Manhattan Island in a campsite known as Konaande Kongh used a landing at around the current location of East 119th street <b>to</b> <b>paddle</b> into the river in canoes fashioned from tree-trunk in order to fish.|$|E
25|$|The total was {{boosted by}} Sarah Elliott, who made 19 not out from 20 balls, and Lisa Sthalekar (18 off 13), putting on 27 from 22 balls. Sthalekar was bowled by Sophie Devine after moving across outside off stump and trying <b>to</b> <b>paddle</b> scoop {{the ball down}} to fine leg. The innings ended with a one-handed catch by New Zealand captain Aimee Watkins, who leapt high at cover to prevent a drive from Rene Farrell going for four.|$|E
50|$|In 1704, the French {{physicist}} Denis Papin {{constructed the}} first ship powered by his steam engine, mechanically linked <b>to</b> <b>paddles.</b> This {{made him the}} first to construct a steam-powered boat (or vehicle of any kind). Then he has poured the first steam cylinder {{of the world in}} the iron foundry Veckerhagen.|$|R
50|$|Public {{stocks were}} {{typically}} positioned {{in the most}} public place available, as public humiliation was a critical aspect of such punishment. Typically, a person condemned to the stocks was subjected {{to a variety of}} abuses, ranging from having refuse thrown at them, tickling <b>to</b> <b>paddling,</b> whipping of the unprotected feet (bastinado).|$|R

25|$|Australia batted {{first and}} Sthalekar {{came in with}} the score at 6/72 in the 16th over to join Sarah Elliott. The pair put on 27 from 22 balls. Sthalekar scored 18 from 13 balls, {{including}} two boundaries, before being bowled by Sophie Devine after moving across outside off stump and trying <b>to</b> <b>paddle</b> scoop the ball down to fine leg in the 19th over. Sthalekar was the only Australian to score at faster than a run a ball as the team ended with 8/106.|$|E
25|$|Montgomery taught {{agriculture}} at Haughton High School in Haughton in Bossier Parish east of Shreveport. At {{that time}} he met Azalee Wilson (1902-1985), the postmistress at Haughton. After three years in Haughton, Montgomery moved to Ruston, the seat of Lincoln Parish, where he taught vocational agriculture at Ruston High School. He received many honors for his teaching abilities and his love and dedication for his students. He was also known <b>to</b> <b>paddle</b> recalcitrant boys. In 1955, Montgomery attended the White House Conference on Education.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} a number of {{techniques}} for unassisted righting and re-entry of a kayak after a capsize and turtling, most paddlers consider it safest <b>to</b> <b>paddle</b> with one or more others, as assistance is useful if attempting to recover via rolling solo fails. Even if the assistance fails to successfully right the kayaker, it is much easier to climb back into a boat in the open sea if one has another boat and paddler to help and the swamped boat has been emptied of water first. Nonetheless, experienced paddlers do attempt open-water crossings unaccompanied, and many major long-distance kayak expeditions have been carried out solo.|$|E
50|$|During {{his stay}} in Kassel in Hesse, in 1704, he {{constructed}} a ship powered by his steam engine, mechanically linked <b>to</b> <b>paddles.</b> This {{made him the}} first to construct a steam-powered boat (or vehicle of any kind). Later, at the iron foundry in Veckerhagen (now Reinhardshagen), he cast the world's first steam cylinder.|$|R
50|$|Ken was 14 {{years old}} when he picked up a kayak paddle for the first time while taking a five-day kayaking course on the Ottawa River in 1989.

25|$|Operation Copper {{was one of}} {{the last}} Z Special {{operations}} in New Guinea. On the night of 11 April 1945, eight operatives were landed near Muschu Island by HDML patrol boat. Their mission was <b>to</b> <b>paddle</b> ashore and reconnoitre the island to determine the status of Japanese defences and validate reports that two 140mm long-range naval guns were still in position. Intelligence suggested that these weapons were back in service and could prove dangerous during the forthcoming invasion of Wewak, as they had sufficient range to fire into the proposed landing areas and, while they would not stop the Australian invasion, they could cause significant casualties.|$|E
25|$|As well {{as being}} a water and {{recreation}} resource, the river was historically a critical communications and transport link for the communities along it. It took about 3 days <b>to</b> <b>paddle</b> a waka from Waiuku to the Cambridge/Te Awamutu area. Taupo, Mangakino, Cambridge, Hamilton, Horotiu, Ngaruawahia, Huntly, Hampton Downs, Meremere, Waiuku and Port Waikato are on or close to it. The Waikato River in Hamilton is frequently used by rowers, kayakers and powered pleasure craft. Water-skiers and jet skis have zones outside the city limits {{where they can be}} used. There are two ramps for launching boats – one in Pukete and the other just north of the traffic (Bridge St) bridge.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 July, Biloxi catapulted two Kingfishers to rescue a pilot sighted in the water just off the {{southwest}} tip of Yap Island. One Kingfisher, flown by Lt(jg). R. Dana, spotted the pilot at 09:05 {{and was able to}} land just outside the reef line surrounding the island. A Japanese anti-aircraft gun began firing at the Kingfisher, but was soon silenced by four circling American fighters. The downed flier managed <b>to</b> <b>paddle</b> his raft through the breaking swells and across the reef where he collapsed from exhaustion. Lt(jg). Dana taxied between the raft and the reef and managed to pull the pilot in with a line. He took off at 09:40 and successfully returned to the task group later that morning.|$|E

No student is forced to submit <b>to</b> a <b>paddling.</b> Students may choose a spanking in lieu of suspension.|$|R
25|$|It {{was about}} this time that Fish began to indulge in self-harm. He would embed needles into his groin and abdomen. After his arrest, X-rays {{revealed}} that Fish had at least 29 needles lodged in his pelvic region. He also hit himself repeatedly with a nail-studded paddle and inserted wool doused with lighter fluid into his anus and set it alight. While he was never thought to have physically attacked or abused his children, he did encourage them and their friends <b>to</b> <b>paddle</b> his buttocks with the same nail-studded paddle he used to abuse himself. He soon developed a growing obsession with cannibalism, often preparing himself a dinner consisting solely of raw meat and sometimes serving it to his children.|$|E
500|$|In summer, Granpa and Emily {{travelled}} to {{the seaside}} <b>to</b> <b>paddle</b> in the sea, build sandcastles, and whilst {{riding on the}} donkeys, had Grandpa imagine himself part of the military tattoo, whilst Emily a princess.
