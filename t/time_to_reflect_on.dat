From inception prisoners main task was the breaking of one cubic yard of rock per day. Until the middle of the 20th century the prisons department's philosophy remained punitive with much reliance on obedience to rules and regulations.|$|E

It was also in Genoa that Augustine thought of establishing a religious order. At 36 years of age, Augustine was ordained a priest on September 19, 1587 in the Church of Saint Restituta. He continued to exercise his pastoral ministry {{as a member of}} the Confraternity of the While Robes of Mercy in Naples, reaching out to the prisoners. Augustine also frequented the Hospital of the Incurabili, where he ministered to the sick and the dying. It was in the course of Augustine's pastoral work in this hospital that he met Fabrizio Caracciolo, a relative of Francis Caracciolo.|$|R

[...] "Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band", Iommi explained. [...] "He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs.

On April 9 before {{boarding}} the airplane to return from the NCAA Final Four, Beilein met with Burke, Hardaway, Robinson and McGary to direct them to seek the advice of the NBA advisory committee. The draft board has until April 15 to develop each individual report and the players have until April 28 to enter the draft. On April 12, ESPN journalist Myron Medcalf described McGary's likelihood of entering the draft as [...] "borderline," [...] noting that his NCAA tournament performance may have given him a sudden chance to be a lottery selection. Several sources regarded him as a likely first round draft choice in the NBA Draft, so there was much speculation about him entering his name into the draft. On April 18, he and Robinson held a joint press conference to announce that they would not enter the draft. [...] This came after Burke and Hardaway entered the draft on the 14th and 17th, respectively.|$|E
500|$|William Phipps in the Anglican Theological Review {{and author}} James Basker have {{interpreted}} the first stanza of [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] {{as evidence of}} Newton's realization that his participation in the slave trade was his wretchedness, perhaps representing a wider common understanding of Newton's motivations. Newton joined forces with {{a young man named}} William Wilberforce, the British Member of Parliament who led the Parliamentarian campaign to abolish the slave trade in the British Empire, culminating in the Slave Trade Act 1807. However, Newton became an ardent and outspoken abolitionist after he left Olney in the 1780s; he never connected the construction of the hymn that became [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] to anti-slavery sentiments. The lyrics in Olney Hymns were arranged by their association to the Biblical verses that would be used by Newton and Cowper in their prayer meetings and did not address any political objective. For Newton, {{the beginning of the year}} was a <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> one's spiritual progress. At the same time he completed a diary which has since been lost that he had begun 17 years before, two years after he quit sailing. The last entry of 1772 was a recounting of how much he had changed since then.|$|E

She sees this huge gash and feels that all her instincts {{about other people}} are wrong – so she ends up running off. [...] has no excuses – all she can think is that she’s really messed up and needs to leave." [...] This plot strand saw Kyla once more resort to drinking while at work, and decide to quit her job, only to be talked out of doing so by Nursing Consultant Mark Williams (Robert Powell). [...] Ayola explained: [...] "He suggests she takes a demotion, so she’ll have less to worry about and more {{time to deal with}} her problems. It's the lifeline she needs, because her work is all she has right now. I think if Kyla did leave, she’d end up simply going home and buying loads of cheap booze." [...] When asked if Kyla would be able to overcome her addiction and regain custody of her son, Ayola responded: [...] "I hope so.

He emphasized that telling the story is what's important, so he really helped me think about what I wanted to say, and figure out who my audience was." [...] Hill explained {{in an interview that}} writing about past events was easier because she had had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> them. She wanted to [...] "convey the history and culture of free climbing", specifically how it became as specialized as it is today. She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer, both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman: [...] "And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently. I think the book is important from that stand point , because I am a woman, and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing, or the history of climbing, out there." [...] Writing about climbing in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was dominated by men. As accomplished American climber and writer Rachel de Silva explains, the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the first women-centric climbing books appeared.|$|E

Symington wrote, [...] "Even as we were charging ahead to reform public policy in the brief time given any governor, I was visited by a ruthless pursuit from the world's most inexhaustible adversary. Let it be recorded that few have fought the federal government and prevailed, but by grace and the love of family and friends, we did." [...] In analyzing his performance as Governor, Symington also stated in the retrospective, [...] "Arizona's government operated comparatively well, without excess partisan rancor and without so many of the Republican peacocks and Democrat bantam roosters we see running around the political barnyard today." [...] He also wrote that he believed Arizona would be [...] "better off" [...] had he been able to further reduce income taxes during his term, if not eliminate them, and also praised Arizona as the home of charter schools, an initiative which began under his tenure.|$|E
2500|$|An ordained {{minister}} {{is called to}} the [...] "office of public ministry" [...] of [...] "Word and sacrament" [...] and considered a [...] "steward of the mysteries" [...] of the Church (i.e., the means of grace). Pastors primarily serve congregations, but this role has been expanded to include other forms of ministry as well (e.g., hospital and military chaplains). Pastors are ordinarily trained at one of eight ELCA seminaries located throughout the United States, although there are alternative paths for ordination to serve particular communities {{in which it is}} difficult to provide trained leaders or to allow rostering of clergy transferred from other denominations. Pastors generally hold a Bachelor of Arts degree or its equivalent, as well as a four-year master of divinity degree, are required to learn biblical Hebrew and Greek, spent at least a summer doing clinical pastoral education—an intensive program that gives them <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> their pastoral craft, usually in a hospital setting, and are required to complete a one-year internship of full-time service in pastoral ministry. A bishop is a pastor called to serve either a synod or as presiding bishop of the ELCA. The Agreement with the Episcopal Church is that bishops be ordained in the Apostolic Succession and remain in that office after retiremen (Called to Common Ministry 2000) whereas before a man or woman servee in that office and returned to being known simply as a pastor when service as a bishop ends.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Fifteen {{years have}} passed since Paul Romer {{published}} his seminal paper that launched the field of endogenous growth. Today seems like an appropriate <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> back <b>on</b> this field and assess its contribution. My own assessment is that this line of research has not proven useful for understanding the most important question faced by economists today, namely, why isn’t the whole world rich. Exogenous growth theory, in contrast, is. Endogenous growth may prove useful for understanding growth in world knowledge over time, but it is not useful for understanding why some countries are so poor relative to the United States today...|$|R
