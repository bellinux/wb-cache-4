5|$|During {{the first}} years of the new century, Ravel made five {{attempts}} to win France's most prestigious prize for young composers, the Prix de Rome, past winners of which included Berlioz, Gounod, Bizet, Massenet and Debussy. In 1900 Ravel was eliminated in the first round; in 1901 he won the second prize for the competition. In 1902 and 1903 he won nothing: according to the musicologist Paul Landormy, the judges suspected Ravel of making fun of them by submitting cantatas so academic as <b>to</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> parodies. In 1905 Ravel, by now thirty, competed for the last time, inadvertently causing a furore. He was eliminated in the first round, which even critics unsympathetic to his music, including Lalo, denounced as unjustifiable. The press's indignation grew when it emerged that the senior professor at the Conservatoire, Charles Lenepveu, was on the jury, and only his students were selected for the final round; his insistence that this was pure coincidence was not well received. L'affaire Ravel became a national scandal, leading to the early retirement of Dubois and his replacement by Fauré, appointed by the government to carry out a radical reorganisation of the Conservatoire.|$|E
25|$|Also at {{the base}} of the Chief's walls are a bewildering variety of medium-to-large size granite boulders. Once {{themselves}} part of the Chief, these boulders form groups which have been carefully explored by bouldering enthusiasts. Some of the boulders are so large as <b>to</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> small cliffs in their own right. The largest is the Cacodemon Boulder {{at the base}} of the Grand Wall, an individual chunk of rock as big as a small apartment building.|$|E
25|$|Domingo Ortega {{suffered}} an automobile accident, and his proxy, Dominguín, asked Sánchez {{to substitute for}} him in Manzanares, on 11 August 1934. This came at a bad time for Sánchez, but because the bulls were great {{he did not want}} <b>to</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> he was avoiding them. He had no car, no hotel, not even a cuadrilla (bullfighting team). For {{the first time in his}} life, he turned to the lottery and drew two tickets with the numbers of the bulls of Ayala that he was scheduled to fight. The first, number 16, Granadino, docile, thin-horned and coarse-skinned, nevertheless gored him.|$|E

25|$|Mentioned {{for a time}} on {{the program}} was Otis Cadwallader, who was a schoolmate of Fibber and Molly in Peoria and Molly's boyfriend before McGee. Fibber has a long-standing grudge against Otis, making him out <b>to</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> a self-centered, overblown hack, even though {{seemingly}} everyone else sees Cadwallader as a lovely, dashing man. Otis's feelings toward Fibber are never mentioned, giving the impression that Fibber's grudge is one-sided. As revealed late in 1942, Fibber's anger is actually a front to keep Cadwallader away, as Fibber once borrowed money from Otis and never paid it back.|$|E
25|$|Psychologists {{may also}} {{work on a}} diverse set of campaigns known broadly as {{psychological}} warfare. Psychologically warfare chiefly {{involves the use of}} propaganda to influence enemy soldiers and civilians. In the case of so-called black propaganda the propaganda is designed <b>to</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> it originates from a different source. The CIA's MKULTRA program involved more individualized efforts at mind control, involving techniques such as hypnosis, torture, and covert involuntary administration of LSD. The U.S. military used the name Psychological Operations (PSYOP) until 2010, when these were reclassified as Military Information Support Operations (MISO), part of Information Operations (IO). Psychologists are sometimes involved in assisting the interrogation and torture of suspects, though this has sometimes been denied by those involved and sometimes opposed by others.|$|E

Rao {{describes}} Yusuf as [...] "an avant-garde pharmacologist, who is {{a resource}} for people, like Cobb, {{who want to do}} this work unsupervised, unregistered and unapproved of by anyone". Co-producer Jordan Goldberg said the role of the chemist was [...] "particularly tough because you don't want him <b>to</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> some kind of drug dealer", and that Rao was cast for being [...] "funny, interesting and obviously smart".|$|E

500|$|To {{contrast}} {{him with}} Naruto, Kishimoto {{was careful to}} never make Sasuke too emotional, instead depicting him as a [...] "cool genius". Kishimoto felt he had created the ideal rivalry in the pair. He wanted Naruto and Sasuke <b>to</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> brothers and rivals at the same time, building on their mutual experience of childhood loneliness. At first, Sasuke does not view Naruto as an opponent worth considering, but is quickly surprised at Naruto's growth, and becomes fiercely competitive. In the finale to Part I, their rivalry leads to a fight and the two grow further apart. Kishimoto {{has said that he}} did not want Sasuke to recognize Naruto as an equal until later in Part II.|$|E
500|$|Roly Sussex of The Courier-Mail {{wrote that}} [...] "have a nice day" [...] can sound [...] "a touch brusque" [...] in {{comparison}} with [...] "you have a nice day". Deeming the word [...] "you" [...] as moderating the imperative, Sussex stated that the word [...] "you" [...] causes the phrase <b>to</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> a mixture of a command and a hope. He wrote that using [...] "you" [...] in imperatives is more common with people under 25. In her 2001 book The Facts on File Dictionary of Clichés, Christina Ammer wrote about the growing usage of [...] "have a good meal" [...] in restaurants. Ammer opined that the phrase [...] "induces teeth-gnashing irritation when voiced by a particularly incompetent waiter".|$|E
500|$|The mixtape samples {{songs from}} Radiohead, Coldplay, MGMT, Mr. Hudson and The Eagles, which Ocean sings over. Ocean, when {{uploading}} the album to iTunes, labeled it as bluegrass and death metal, out of arbitrariness. When asked {{about why he}} uploaded the songs in that way, he replied; [...] "I don't want <b>to</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> I have a cause against genres, or maybe I do... Bluegrass is swag. Bluegrass is all the way swag." [...] Ocean described the making of his mixtape as a labor of love, stating that [...] "It was like difficult to make. Not like writing the songs [...] arranging the songs. That had a level of difficulty, too. But just piecing together all the levels {{to do it at}} the level, the quality of records I wanted to make… But, it was a process I appreciate so much." ...|$|E

500|$|To avoid {{confusion}} with Larter and Carter, Cook {{was required to}} dye her hair brown for the role. [...] "I like being a chameleon. It opens you up for so much more in this work. You don't get typecast," [...] Cook professed. Landes also denied plots regarding Thomas and Kimberly's relationship. [...] "It's kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. They didn’t want to go there, I guess. They did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn’t want it <b>to</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> the cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, {{is a little bit}} of chemistry and you get the idea that through tragedy something good will come. So it ends in an optimistic way, that maybe they can be together but there’s no real love story," [...] Landes articulated.|$|E
500|$|Markus and McFeely {{wanted to}} adapt Ed Brubaker's Winter Soldier storyline from the comics, which they {{described}} as [...] "the tone of Cap’s modern franchise", {{but it took}} the duo six months to convince themselves {{that they could do}} it. In the meantime, while thinking how to progress from the war film tone of The First Avenger, the writers settled on the conspiracy genre for the screenplay, and cited Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, and Marathon Man as influences, feeling it better conveyed Captain America's trust issues and contrasting values in the new world he was living in, with Markus saying, [...] "If you put that 1940s man into present day geo-politics everything is going <b>to</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> a conspiracy. It's just going to seem dirty and underhanded and shifty, and people won't be telling the truth." [...] Three Days of the Condor in particular was used as the main source of the script structure, following the idea that the protagonist is being chased by a threat they, along with the audience, only discover halfway through the film.|$|E
500|$|Mendes {{encouraged}} some improvisation; for example, when Lester masturbates in {{bed beside}} Carolyn, the director asked Spacey to improvise several euphemisms for the act in each take. Mendes said, [...] "I wanted that {{not just because}} it was funny but because I didn't want it to seem rehearsed. I wanted it <b>to</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> he was blurting it out of his mouth without thinking. [...] is so in control—I wanted him to break through." [...] Spacey obliged, eventually coming up with 35 phrases, but Bening could not always keep a straight face, which meant the scene had to be shot 10 times. The production used small amounts of computer-generated imagery. Most of the rose petals in Lester's fantasies were added in post-production, although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed. When Lester fantasizes about Angela in a rose-petal bath, the steam was real, save for in the overhead shot. To position the camera, a hole had to be cut in the ceiling, through which the steam escaped; it was instead added digitally.|$|E

500|$|Morello and Cornell {{initially}} disagreed {{over the}} particulars of Cornell quitting the group, with Morello claiming that Cornell did not communicate directly with him about leaving, while Cornell countered: [...] "Tom and I did have communications {{about the fact that}} I was gonna go make a record, and that I was tired of what ended up seeming like political negotiations toward how we were gonna do Audioslave business and getting nowhere with it." [...] He also added that this process of [...] "doing Audioslave business" [...] led him to go solo. Cornell has said that the breakup was not about money, but that he was just not getting along with the other members during their later years. Said Cornell, [...] "Getting along as people is one thing. Getting along as a group of people that can work together in a band situation...We weren't particularly getting along well, no. Bands work in a way where everyone at some point has to have a similar idea of how you do things...Three albums into it, it started <b>to</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> our interests weren't as conjoined anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{final three}} episodes {{of the season}} were [...] "linked in one {{continuous}} story arc," [...] and meant <b>to</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> [...] "you're turning the last page of a chapter in a novel. And usually in a good novel, the last pages [...] compels you forward with {{a new understanding of}} what the subject matter is and you get deeper and you can’t wait to turn that page." [...] The crew wrote the finale before the season was officially renewed, but deigned to leave it unchanged once discovering that a fourth season had been approved. Pinkner explained that [...] "we wrote the episode, perhaps foolishly, assuming that we would be on for Season 4. We never for one second entertained that it {{would be the end of}} the series. So therefore, we didn't have to change a word!" [...] The finale was designed to establish the groundwork by [...] "open a new chapter" [...] for the new season, which included Peter having never existed. Its futuristic storyline was meant to [...] "inform the present of the show with some thematic elements," [...] establishing to viewers that [...] "our world is going to break down." ...|$|E

[...] More important, what are we made of? [...] In the past religion answered these questions, often in considerable detail. [...] Now we know that almost all these answers are highly likely to be nonsense, having sprung from man's ignorance and his enormous capacity for self-deception...

2500|$|Billboards Melinda Newman {{described}} the record as [...] "a fine collection" [...] and [...] "beautifully rendered"; she also found Streisand's heavy amount of detail able to [...] "elevate [...] {{the quality of}} this project far above the usual Christmas fare". Tom Santopietro, author of The Importance of Being Barbra, considered it to be Streisand's [...] "most consistently successful CD" [...] since The Broadway Album (1985). He called her [...] "song choices [...] uniformly excellent" [...] and stated that [...] "I'll Be Home for Christmas", [...] "What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?", and [...] "One God" [...] were the album's three best tracks. William Ruhlmann, of AllMusic, opined that the album [...] "may come <b>to</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> a remarkably dour holiday collection" [...] due to its release taking place after the September 11 attacks, but overall found that its mood [...] "could hardly be improved upon" [...] given the situation. He felt that this exemplified the ability of [...] "great artists", such as Streisand, to create and release music that [...] "take {{the temperature of the}} times with their work". Alexa Camp from Slant Magazine claimed that Christmas Memories contains [...] "timeless holiday ambience courtesy of a consummate pro"; however, she considered the songs between [...] "Snowbound" [...] and [...] "Grown-Up Christmas List" [...] to be boring.|$|E
2500|$|... 1938 - A new Exposition Internationale du Surréalisme {{was held}} at the Beaux-arts Gallery, Paris, with more than 60 artists from {{different}} countries, and showed around 300 paintings, objects, collages, photographs and installations. The Surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act and called on Marcel Duchamp, Wolfgang Paalen, Man Ray and others to do so. At the exhibition's entrance Salvador Dalí placed his Rainy Taxi (an old taxi rigged to produce a steady drizzle of water down the inside of the windows, and a shark-headed creature in the driver's seat and a blond mannequin crawling with live snails in the back) greeted the patrons who were in full evening dress. Surrealist Street filled one side of the lobby with mannequins dressed by various Surrealists. Paalen and Duchamp designed the main hall <b>to</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> subterranean cave with 1,200 coal bags suspended from the ceiling over a coal brazier with a single light bulb which provided the only lighting, as well as the floor covered with humid leaves and mud. The patrons were given flashlights with which to view the art. On the floor Wolfgang Paalen created a small lake with grasses and the aroma of roasting coffee filled the air. Much to the Surrealists' satisfaction the exhibition scandalized the viewers.|$|E
