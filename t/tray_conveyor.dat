This study {{presents}} a design {{and development of}} a machine which integrated mechanical and enzymatic solutions in the decortications of pepper pericarp to improve the efficiency of white pepper production as compared to conventional water retting method. A power operated enzymatic retting machine for producing white pepper was tested and its performance evaluated. The major parts were grinding surfaces, pectinase solution <b>tray,</b> screw <b>conveyor</b> enclosed in cylindrical drum, and 0. 5 hp motor. Freshly harvested green pepper berries soaked in enzyme solution and the retting machine was operated {{for a period of}} 14 days. For comparison, green pepper soaked in tap water (control) under the same retting condition were conducted. The study showed that the combination of enzymatic process with automated machine have significant influence on process time and finished product quality. The white pepper obtained using the enzymatic retting machine was achieved in only five days and the quality was superior compared to the control...|$|R

The tray is then moved downwardly on a supporting framework to be positioned adjacent an open coop compartment of a multi-compartment coop unit following which the tray is pivoted to deposit the fowl in the associated coop compartment. The multi-compartment coop unit is shiftable into one of two positions in which one of two vertically aligned banks of coop compartments is positioned in alignment with the fowl receiving and depositing <b>tray.</b> <b>Conveyor</b> is provided for removing the multi-compartment coop unit following the filling of same so as to permit the positioning of an empty multi-compartment coop unit on the apparatus for subsequent filling purposes...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{automation}} and reliability of the mechanized transplanting, a vegetable seedling automatic conveying system was designed. The functional execution component of the system consists of a tank-wheel storage seedling mechanism, a seedling <b>tray</b> <b>conveyor,</b> and a hanging cup circulating conveying mechanism. Combined with the communication technology between host computer and programmable logic controller (PLC), the user interface software of automatic conveying system for potted vegetable was developed by using Visual Studio to control and monitor the transmission progress. The PVDF pressure sensor was used to detect the pressure change of the seedling storage disk to obtain the information of the loading seedling tray. The limit switch and stroke switch were combined to obtain the information of the push rod and feed plate. The timing of each component {{is controlled by the}} PLC controller combined with the feedback information of each sensor. The test results show the effect of taking an individual seedling is excellent, the error rate of the pushing mechanism is about 2.08 %, and the success rate was 97.91 %.|$|E
30|$|The {{conveying}} {{monitoring module}} comprises a seedling storage monitoring module, a seedling taking monitoring module, and a cup-type circulating conveying monitoring module. The monitoring module includes a pressure sensor {{and a lack}} of seedling indicator light. A PVDF pressure sensor (response time <[*] 1  ms, response point <[*] 200  g, range 0 – 50  kg) was arranged on the slot-wheeled seedling storage tray and used to detect whether there is a potted vegetable seedling tray waiting to be delivered. According to the change of the pressure signal, the controller directs the motor to drive the sprocket wheel of the storage plate and carries out the transfer of the seedling plate. By setting a stroke switch on the sprocket conveyor belt, the position of the seedling tray conveying is detected, and the push rod mechanism is triggered to perform the pushing action, and the seedling tray is moved from the seedling storage mechanism to the seedling <b>tray</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt. A finite position sensor is arranged at the junction between the conveyor belt of the seedling tray and the push rod mechanism. When it is detected that the seedling tray enters the conveyor belt from the storage mechanism, the signal is sent to the controller to stop the pushing action. The stability of the conveying action is ensured. The abnormal extraction of seedling was obtained by detecting the pressure change of the seedling pushing mechanism by pressure sensor. The potted vegetable seedling is taken out from the seedling tray and conveyed to the conveying mechanism. The CCD camera is arranged above the conveying track of the cup to monitor the leakage and load status of the potted vegetable seedling in the cups and to obtain the conveying information.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the design of}} novel two-phase fingers to passively reorient objects while picking them up. Two-phase refers {{to a change in}} the finger-object contact geometry, from a free spinning point contact to a firm multipoint contact, as the gripping force increases. We exploit the two phases to passively reorient prismatic objects from a horizontal resting pose to an upright secure grasp. This problem is particularly relevant to industrial assembly applications where parts often are presented lying on <b>trays</b> or <b>conveyor</b> belts and need to be assembled vertically. Each two-phase finger is composed of a small hard contact point attached to an elastic strip mounted over a V-groove cavity. When grasped between two parallel fingers with low gripping force, the object pivots about the axis between the contact points on the strips, and aligns upright with gravity. A subsequent increase in the gripping force makes the elastic strips recede into the cavities letting the part seat in the V-grooves to secure the grasp. The design is compatible with any type of parallel-jaw gripper, and can be reconfigured to specific objects by changing the geometry of the cavity. The two-phase gripper provides robots with the capability to accurately position and manipulate parts, reducing the need for dedicated part feeders or time-demanding regrasp procedures.

40|$|X-ray {{images of}} {{pistachio}} nuts on <b>conveyor</b> <b>trays</b> for product inspection are considered. The {{first step in}} such a processor is to locate each individual item {{and place it in}} a separate file for input to a classifier to determine the quality of each nut. This paper considers new techniques to: detect each item (each nut can be in any orientation, we employ new rotation-invariant filters to locate each item independent of its orientation), produce separate image files for each item (a new blob coloring algorithm provides this for isolated (non-touching) input items), segmentation to provide separate image files for touching or overlapping input items (we use a morphological watershed transform to achieve this), and morphological processing to remove the shell and produce an image of only the nutmeat. Each of these operations and algorithms are detailed and quantitative data for each are presented for the X-ray image nut inspection problem noted. These techniques are of general use in many [...] ...|$|R
30|$|The {{loading and}} {{unloading}} detection system mainly detects the position change of the seedling plate from the seedling storage mechanism to the seedling plate conveyor belt and obtains the position signal as the action control signal of {{loading and unloading}}. The system includes PVDF pressure sensor, travel switch, limit sensor, and a single lamp. The PVDF pressure sensor is arranged {{in the middle of}} the slot wheel-type seedling storage tray and is in the same vertical plane with the push rod mechanism, which is used to detect whether the seedling storage tray is empty or not. It also lights the single lamp and instructs the start of the sprocket drive motor. The stroke switch mainly detects the displacement of the sprocket drive of the seedling storage tray and determines whether the seedling storage tray reaches the feeding position. Its signal is used to instruct the push rod mechanism to push the seedling <b>tray</b> to the <b>conveyor</b> belt. The limit sensor is installed at the starting position of the conveyor belt, and its signal is used to control the reset action of the pushing mechanism.|$|R
