500|$|The {{film was}} [...] "plagued by bad buzz" [...] before release {{with the media}} speculating about the {{possible}} influence of Scientology and commenting on the production's tight security. As the film was entering post-production, the alternative newspaper Mean Magazine obtained {{a copy of the}} screenplay. Mean’s staffers changed the script's title to [...] "Dark Forces," [...] re-attributed it to [...] "Desmond Finch," [...] and circulated it to readers at major Hollywood film production companies. <b>The</b> <b>comments</b> <b>that</b> came back were unfavorable: [...] "a thoroughly silly plotline is made all the more ludicrous by its hamfisted dialog and ridiculously shallow characterizations", [...] "a completely predictable story that just isn't written well enough to make up for its lack of originality". One reviewer labeled the screenplay [...] "as entertaining as watching a fly breathe".|$|E
500|$|The BBC was {{subjected}} to criticism from some of its own staff, as Radio 4 broadcaster Sue MacGregor said that the show [...] "gave the impression of attack dogs against Nick Griffin", and another presenter called it a [...] "bear pit". In defence of criticism of the format and focus of the programme, the Deputy Director General Mark Byford stated that [...] "the agenda of the programme was set by the audience's own questions". Byford also said of <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> <b>that</b> [...] "clearly Mr Griffin and the BNP were the subject of intense questioning, but all the panellists were {{given the opportunity to}} respond and to have their voices heard". Sir Christopher Bland, {{the former chairman of the}} BBC's board of governors, said, however, that had the BBC not changed the format, the corporation would probably have been accused of leniency.|$|E
500|$|Fodor's {{praised the}} food as a [...] "unique fusion of European and Asian flavors". According to the critic from Time Out Chicago, the {{restaurant}} {{is more of a}} place to impress clients and dates than a top–notch dining experience with top-notch cuisine due to its association with Donald Trump and its views. [...] The magazine's annual Eating & Drinking guide describes the dining room as stately and impressive, the staff as attentive and professional and the food as well-presented. [...] Kamin remarks that although some of <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> <b>that</b> he received by e-mail are not as supportive of the entire structure as they are of the restaurant, the restaurant provides an opportunity for people to emulate Guy de Maupassant, who is said to have disliked the Eiffel Tower so much that he ate at the tower's restaurant daily so as not to have to look at its iron monstrosity. According to the Forbes Travel Guide: 2010 City Guide: Chicago, the hotel hosted one of the seven four-star restaurants in Chicago, which had two five-star restaurants. Three years later, according to the Forbes Travel Guide: 2013 City Guide the restaurant was one of only three five-star restaurants in Chicago. It remained one of only 3 five-star Forbes-rated restaurants in the 2015 Forbes Guide (along with Alinea and Grace).|$|E

Further investigation revealed {{the cause of death was}} [...] "manual strangulation", and that the investigation would be handled as a murder.

[...] When questioned, Abbott said he stood by <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> <b>that</b> WorkChoices means [...] "certain protections" [...] are not {{what they used to}} be, but denied conceding workers had lost protections.

2500|$|Most of Haruki Murakami's works use first-person {{narrative}} {{in the tradition}} of the Japanese I Novel. He states that because family plays a significant role in traditional Japanese literature, any main character who is independent becomes a man who values freedom and solitude over intimacy. Also notable is Murakami's unique humor, as seen in his 2000 short story collection, After the Quake. In the story [...] "Superfrog Saves Tokyo", the protagonist is confronted with a 6-foot tall frog that talks about the destruction of Tokyo over a cup of tea. In spite of the story's sober tone, Murakami feels the reader should be entertained once the seriousness of a subject has been broached. Another notable feature of Murakami's stories are <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> <b>that</b> come from the main characters as to how strange the story presents itself. Murakami explains that his characters experience what he experiences as he writes, which could be compared to a movie set where the walls and props are all fake.|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{motorized}} vehicles {{banned from}} the refuge are radio-controlled aircraft. Model airplane enthusiasts, who took to the site and its abandoned runways before it was transferred to FWS, had hoped {{to continue to be}} allowed to do so under its management. Many of them wrote in with public comments favoring their hobby, saying wild birds and model airplanes could indeed coexist as they had for 30 years of model aviation at the former airport. While eventually 90% of <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> <b>that</b> addressed it supported model airplaning, FWS did not believe that it was compatible with the goal of preserving a safe habitat for the birds, and officially banned it. Academy of Model Aeronautics president Carl Maroney charged that the agency had made up its mind before soliciting public input. Three years later, the controversy had still not faded as Eastern U.S. Free Flight Conference president Robert Langelius told Congress that the USFWS had been [...] "completely intransigent" [...] and that many enthusiasts had given up the sport for lack of available space.|$|E

6000|$|It {{is one of}} {{the trials}} of our mortal state, one of the {{disciplines}} of our virtue, that the world's benefactors and reformers are so often without form or comeliness. The very force necessary to sustain the conflict makes them appear unlovely; they [...] "tread the wine press alone, and of the people there is none with them." [...] The shrieks, and groans, and agonies of men wrestling in mortal combat are often not graceful or gracious; but <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> <b>that</b> the children of the Puritans, and the children of the Covenanters, make on the ungraceful and severe elements which marked the struggles of their great fathers, are as ill-timed as if a son, whom a mother had just borne from a burning dwelling, should criticize the shrieks with which she sought him, and point out to ridicule the dishevelled hair and singed garments which show how she struggled for his life. But these are they which are [...] "sown in weakness, but raised in power; which are sown in dishonor, but raised in glory:" [...] even in this world they will have their judgment day, and their names which went down in the dust like a gallant banner trodden in the mire, shall rise again all glorious in the sight of nations.|$|E

6000|$|Arthur Pendennis had {{the good}} fortune to have a mother endowed with these happy qualities. During his {{childhood}} and youth, the boy thought of her as little less than an angel,--as a supernatural being, all wisdom, love, and beauty. When her husband drove her into the county town, or to the assize balls or concerts there, he would step into the assembly with his wife on his arm, and look the great folks in the face, as much as to say, [...] "Look at that, my lord; can any of you show me a woman like that?" [...] She enraged some country ladies with three times her money, by a sort of desperate perfection which they found in her. Miss Pybus said she was cold and haughty; Miss Pierce, that she was too proud for her station; Mrs. Wapshot, as a doctor of divinity's lady, would have the pas of her, who was only the wife of a medical practitioner. In the meanwhile, this lady moved through the world quite regardless of all <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> <b>that</b> were made in her praise or disfavour. She did not seem to know that she was admired or hated for being so perfect: but carried on calmly through life, saying her prayers, loving her family, helping her neighbours, and doing her duty.|$|E
60|$|As to {{the smaller}} details of this life beyond, it is better perhaps not to treat them, for the very good reason that they are small details. We will learn them all soon for ourselves, {{and it is only}} vain curiosity which leads us to ask for them now. One thing is clear: there are higher intelligences over yonder to whom {{synthetic}} chemistry, which not only makes the substance but moulds the form, is a matter of absolute ease. We see them at work in the coarser media, perceptible to our material senses, in the seance room. If they can build up simulacra in the seance room, how much may we expect them to do when they are working upon ethereal objects in that ether which is their own medium. It may be said generally that they can make something which is analogous to anything which exists upon earth. How they do it may well be a matter of guess and speculation among the less advanced spirits, as the phenomena of modern science are a matter of guess and speculation to us. If one of us were suddenly called up by the denizen of some sub-human world, and were asked to explain exactly what gravity is, or what magnetism is, how helpless we should be! We may put ourselves in the position, then, of a young engineer soldier like Raymond Lodge, who tries to give some theory of matter in the beyond--a theory which is very likely contradicted by some other spirit who is also guessing at things above him. He may be right, or he may be wrong, but he is doing his best to say what he thinks, as we should do in similar case. He believes that his transcendental chemists can make anything, and that even such unspiritual matter as alcohol or tobacco could come within their powers and could still be craved for by unregenerate spirits. This has tickled the critics {{to such an extent that}} one would really think to read <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> <b>that</b> it was the only statement in a book which contains 400 closely-printed pages. Raymond may be right or wrong, but the only thing which the incident proves to me is the unflinching courage and honesty of the man who chronicled it, knowing well the handle that he was giving to his enemies.|$|E
60|$|Then Woollacott began, {{and told}} me briefly the whole story. He had {{consulted}} with the superintendent and Sir Theophilus, {{without saying a word}} to me about it, and had kept a close watch upon all the letters that came for Mactavish. A rare Anglo-Saxon coin is not a chattel that one can easily get rid of every day; and Woollacott shrewdly gathered from what Sir Theophilus had told him that Mactavish (or whoever else had stolen the coin) would be likely to try to dispose of it as far away from England as possible, especially after all <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> <b>that</b> had been made on this particular Wulfric in the English newspapers. So he took every opportunity of intercepting the postman at the front door, and looking out for envelopes with foreign postage stamps. At last one day a letter arrived for Mactavish with an Italian stamp and a cardinal's red hat stamped like a crest on the flap of the envelope. Woollacott was certain that things of that sort didn't come to Mactavish every day about his ordinary business. Braving the penalties for appropriating a letter, he took the liberty to open this suspicious communication, and found it was a note from Cardinal Trevelyan, the Pope's Chamberlain, and a well-known collector of antiquities referring to early Church history in England, and that it was in reply to an offer of Mactavish's to send the Cardinal for inspection a rare gold coin not otherwise specified. The Cardinal expressed his readiness to see the coin, and to pay a hundred and fifty pounds for it, if it proved to be rare and genuine as described. Woollacott felt certain that this communication must refer to the gold Wulfric. He therefore handed the letter to Mrs. Mactavish when the postman next came his rounds, and waited to see whether Mactavish any day afterwards went to the post to register a small box or packet. Meanwhile he communicated with Emily and the superintendent, being unwilling to buoy me up with a doubtful hope until he was quite sure that their plan had succeeded. The superintendent wrote immediately to the Cardinal, mentioning his suspicions, and received a reply to the effect that he expected a coin of Wulfric to be sent him shortly. Sir Theophilus, who had been greatly interested in the question of the coin, kindly offered to take Emily over to Rome, {{in order to get the}} criminating piece, as soon as it arrived, from Cardinal Trevelyan. That was, in turn, the story that they all told me, piece by piece, in the Central Station at Rome that eventful morning.|$|E
