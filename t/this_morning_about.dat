5|$|My dearest mother, <b>This</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>about</b> four o'clock, I was got up, {{just one}} hour after I retired, with the {{information}} that at six {{we were going to}} Richmond. At six we started. The rebs had gone at three, along a road strewn with all the munitions of war. Richmond was reached, but the barbarous South had consigned it to flames. The roar of the bursting shells was terrific.|$|E

6000|$|... "Never mind. I'll {{do my best}} {{in spite}} of him. Tell me, was I dreaming or did I really meet you in the hall <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> at <b>about</b> twenty minutes after two?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is curious, however," [...] {{continued}} Mr Hazlit, [...] "that I {{had been}} thinking <b>this</b> very <b>morning</b> <b>about</b> making inquiries after a diver, one whom I have frequently heard spoken of as an exceedingly able and respectable man--Balding or Bolding or some such name, I think." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Very well, sir, if {{you wish}} it so; but I would rather that you and I arrange with him direct, {{and that it is}} not done by your solicitors. Danvers told me {{that you were going to}} them <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>about</b> that infamous {{paragraph}} in the [...] "Liar."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{not that}} one," [...] he said reluctantly. [...] "No hope there, I'm afraid. I saw Goble <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>about</b> that, {{and he said}} it didn't add up right. The one that's going to be put on is 'The Primrose Way.' You remember? It's got a big part for a girl in it." ...|$|E

6000|$|MRS. HOPE. Well, if I'd thought you'd have {{forgotten}} {{what you said}} <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and turned <b>about</b> like this, d'you suppose I'd have spoken to you at all? Now, do you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. They are, or {{at least}} they were, the {{orchestra}} of the Berlin Opera. They are now the Bolshevik Music Commission. They are here <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to see <b>about</b> getting their second violinist hanged." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} what we said to each other <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>about</b> telling our faults?" [...] he asked abruptly, finding that she still remained immovable. [...] "We spoke lightly perhaps, and you may well have done so. But {{for me it was}} no light promise. I want to make a confession to you, Love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't explain much, ma'am. All I know is that, as I {{was going}} {{along the road}} <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>about</b> a mile out of Anglebury, I heard {{something}} trotting after me like a doe, and looking round there she was, white as death itself. 'Oh, Diggory Venn!' she said, 'I thought 'twas you: will you help me? I am in trouble.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, my dear father," [...] {{she went}} on {{as she watched the}} candle burn up, [...] "you made such a fuss <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>about</b> the dinner being punctually at half-past seven, and now it is eight o'clock and you are not dressed. It is enough to ruin any cook," [...] and she broke off for the first time, seeing that her father was not alone.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm glad of it,' said Lowten. 'We {{were keeping}} it up pretty tolerably at the Stump last night, and I'm rather {{out of sorts}} <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Perker's been <b>about</b> that {{business}} of yours, by the bye.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Samuelson's jewels," [...] he complained, [...] "were {{like his}} wines, all sparkle and outside--no body to them. Two {{thousand}} pounds indeed! Why, {{we shall be}} lucky if we clear four hundred!" [...] The man's coolness absolutely took me aback. For a moment I simply stared at him. [...] "He'll be round to see you <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> sometime, <b>about</b> my character," [...] Mr. Parker proceeded.|$|R
60|$|Last night, or <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> rather, <b>about</b> two o'clock, as I {{lay with}} {{the printed page}} {{swimming}} drowsily before me, I was aroused by an abrupt outbreak of snarl from Mr. Pike. I located him as at the break of the poop; and the man at whom he snarled was Larry, evidently on the main deck beneath him. Not until Wada brought me breakfast did I learn what had occurred.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are {{not very}} rich, sire. But there is {{one way in which}} money may very readily be gained. There was some talk <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>about</b> the Huguenots, and whether they should dwell any longer in this Catholic kingdom. Now, if they are driven out, and if their {{property}} were taken by the state, then indeed your Majesty would at once become the richest monarch in Christendom." ...|$|E
6000|$|What {{it seems}} to say is this: [...] "Serious Disgrace on the Old Old Bridge. <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> <b>about</b> 7.30, Mr. Joseph Sciatti, aged 55, of Casellina and Torri, while {{standing}} up in a sitting posture {{on top of a}} carico barrow of vedure (foliage? hay? vegetables?), lost his equilibrium and fell on himself, arriving with his left leg under one of the wheels of the vehicle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Tyler," [...] he said, in {{his usual}} speech-making style, [...] "when our friend Ben told us <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>about</b> your having {{discovered}} Mr. Stubbs's brother, we sent out and got this collar for the monkey, and we take the greatest possible pride in presenting it to you; although, {{if it had been}} something that my Lilly could have made with her own fair fingers, I should have liked it better." ...|$|E
60|$|I like Mr. Whiting very much, {{and hence}} would wish him to remain or resign as best suits himself. Hearing this much from me, {{do as you}} think best in the matter. General Lee has sent the Russell letter back, concluding, as I {{understand}} from Grant, that their dignity does not admit of their receiving the document from us. Robert just now tells me {{there was a little}} rumpus up the line <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> ending <b>about</b> where it began.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{felt that}} I must ring you up," [...] he declared, [...] "to congratulate you, Miss Conyers, upon your brother's exploit. I have had {{half a dozen}} soldier fellows in already <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to talk <b>about</b> it, and we're simply mad with curiosity.

6000|$|... "I {{was in the}} {{antechamber}} when His Majesty {{arrived for}} le petit lever of M. le Contr√¥leur. I had had vague hopes of seeing you <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and lingered <b>about</b> the reception rooms somewhat listlessly, my thoughts dwelling on all the sad news which has lately come from Scotland. In the antechamber His Majesty was met by M. le Duc d'Aumont, your father." ...|$|R
6000|$|The doctor {{rose and}} took up his hat; then he {{suddenly}} turned toward Miss Drane and said, [...] "La Fleur, our cook, came {{to speak to me}} <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>about</b> your mother. She says she thinks that you are not well lodged; that the street is in the hottest part of the town, and that Mrs. Drane's health will suffer if you stay there. Does your mother object to your present quarters?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Absolutely," [...] Lord Saxthorpe declared. [...] "The idea {{seems to}} be that the fellow was brought to one of the houses in the neighbourhood, and we were all rather {{chaffing}} one another <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>about</b> it. Inspector Yardley--the stout fellow with the beard, you know--was just starting off in his dog-cart to make enquiries round the neighbourhood. If any one in fiction wants a type of the ridiculous detective, there he is, ready-made." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, have done!" [...] {{she broke}} in. [...] "They {{come to take}} me, and I'll not be taken! They come to kill you, and I'll not see you slain and live. I had words with my father <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>about</b> the Frenchman and, I fear, let out the truth. He told me then that ere the Dunwich roses bloomed again she who loved you would have naught but bones to kiss. Dick, you know the fen; where can we hide till nightfall?" ...|$|E
40|$|Posted by Prof Henry G. Overman] As {{the housing}} crisis continues, {{politicians}} continue to say silly things about housing. Here's a round up of three efforts {{from the middle}} of last year. I was reminded of this by Harriet Harman on the Today Programme <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Talking <b>about</b> improving housing affordability she was asked if she would like to see housing prices fall. This is, of course, a tricky question for a British politician - and she dodged it by saying that house price falls would be bad but that Labour were committed to increasing supply and improving affordability...|$|R
6000|$|... "So it does, so it does," [...] {{said the}} old man with changed air, [...] "dear me, it must be very late. I must to bed, to bed! Let me see," [...] rising and looking wistfully all round, first on the stools and settees, and then on the carpet, [...] "let me see, let me see;--is there {{anything}} I have forgot,--forgot? Something I a sort of dimly remember. Something, my son--careful man--told me at starting <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>this</b> very <b>morning.</b> Something <b>about</b> seeing to--something before I got into my berth. What could it be? Something for safety. Oh, my poor old memory!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Folly {{about her}} spouse! The decree from Rome has annulled the foolish mummery of her infancy. It came {{a week after}} the Protestant conspiracy, and was {{registered}} when the Norman peasants at Chateau Leurre showed contumacy. It was well; for, behold, our gallant is among his English friends, recovering, and even writing a billet. Anon he will be upon our hands in person. By the best fortune, Gillot fell in with his messenger <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> prowling <b>about</b> {{on his way to the}} convent, and brought him to me to be examined. I laid him fat in ward, and sent Gillot off to ride day and night to bring my son down to secure the girl at once.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The fellow {{is already}} identified," [...] the Director of Police declared. [...] "I can satisfy monsieur's curiosity. He was {{connected}} with a firm of English tailors here, who sought business from the gentlemen in the hotel. He had accordingly sometimes the entr√©e to their apartments. The fellow {{is reported to have}} saved a little money and to have visited the tables. He lost everything. He came <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>about</b> his business as usual, but, overcome by despair, stabbed himself, most regrettably in the apartments of monsieur." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Connie," [...] went on Milly, when I had promised, [...] "it was {{the funniest}} thing yet, but it was horrid of McCall. You see, the Rube had upper seven and Nan had lower seven. Early <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>about</b> daylight, Nan awoke very thirsty and got up to get a drink. During her absence, probably, but any way some time last night, McCall changed the number on her curtain, and when Nan came back to number seven of course she almost got in the wrong berth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{lied to you}} <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>about</b> the money. It's true {{enough that}} I gambled away the ten pounds at Roxham fair, instead of paying it into the bank as you told me, but he persuaded me to it, and he was to have shared the profits if we won. I was a blackguard, {{but he was a}} bigger blackguard; why should I have all the blame and have that fellow {{continually}} shoved down my throat as a saint? And so I thrashed him, and that is all about it." ...|$|E
60|$|Let us {{go back to}} {{a certain}} fine morning in the September of the year 1857, when Mr. Hopper had arrived, all unnoticed, at the age of two and thirty. Industry had told. He was now the manager's assistant; and, be it said in passing, knew more about the stock than Mr. Hood himself. On <b>this</b> {{particular}} <b>morning,</b> <b>about</b> nine o'clock, he was stacking bolts of woollen goods near that delectable counter where the Colonel was wont to regale his principal customers, when a vision appeared in the door. Visions were rare at Carvel & Company's. This one was followed by an old negress with leathery wrinkles, whose smile was joy incarnate. They entered the store, paused {{at the entrance to the}} Colonel's private office, and surveyed it with dismay.|$|R

Jerry's day begins badly when he wakes late, and gets worse when he nearly wrecks his car while driving his sister and his school friend Franny (Anne Ryan) to Weaver High School, where the students <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> are gossiping <b>about</b> the new student Buddy Revell (Richard Tyson), a violent delinquent who has transferred in today from a continuation high school.|$|R

[...] He also offers her a milk bath. While he is there a dining Arab sheik offers him wealth in return for his [...] "whiteness." ...|$|R
