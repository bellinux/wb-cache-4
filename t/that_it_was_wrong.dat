5|$|One {{objection}} is that two-level utilitarianism undermines an agent's {{commitment to}} act in accordance {{with his or her}} moral principles. For example, a theist will comply with his/her moral code because he/she sees it as based upon God's will. However, a two-level utilitarian knows that his everyday set of moral rules is merely a guideline, and as such any breach of these rules is unlikely to accompany the same degree of guilt as would someone who believed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> in principle {{to act in}} that way.|$|E
5|$|On November 9, 2000, the WWF filed {{a lawsuit}} against the PTC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, {{claiming}} that the PTC's statements were false and constituted defamation. The WWF also filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the PTC for using clips from WWF programs in their promotional videos. The PTC filed for dismissal of the suit, but on May 24, 2001, U.S. district court Judge Denny Chin denied the PTC's motion on the basis that the WWF's lawsuit had merit. The PTC and the WWF settled out of court and, as part of the settlement agreement, the PTC paid the WWF $3.5 million USD and Bozell issued a public apology, stating <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> to blame the World Wrestling Federation or any of its programs for the deaths of children and that the original statements had been based on what was later found to be false information designed by people close to the Lionel Tate case to blame the death of Tiffany Eunick on the WWF.|$|E

By November 1906 Wedge came to believe <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> to fight except in self-defense, {{and that he should}} devote his life to Christian service.

25|$|When Zach dies {{in a plane}} crash, Greenlee feels {{responsible}} because Zach {{was trying}} to help her, and Kendall blames her for exactly the same reason. On December 28, Greenlee gets trapped in the Fusion elevator while Kendall is outside of the elevator. Still blaming Greenlee for Zach's death, Kendall is initially hesitant to help her. While trapped in the elevator, Greenlee and Kendall talk about Zach's death, during which Greenlee breaks down completely, stating that she loves both of them and is tormented by her inability to relieve Kendall's pain, climaxing when she tearfully proclaims that she should have died in Zach's place. With this, Kendall realizes that she does not want to lose Greenlee too, and manages to get help. Though Greenlee continues to insist that she does not deserve Kendall's help and that she should be dead instead of Zach, Kendall immediately denies it, reassuring her that it was never her fault that Zach's plane crashed and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> of her to blame Greenlee in the first place, the two subsequently embracing and tearfully reaffirming their friendship before going back to Ryan's house, where Kendall tells everyone that it was Zach's influence that led her to save Greenlee.|$|E
25|$|The {{format of}} the {{competition}} changed from 1954: 16 teams still competed in four groups of four, but this time each team played {{each of the other}} teams in its group at least once, without extra time {{in the event of a}} draw. Two points were awarded for a win and one point for a draw. If the first two teams finished on equal points then goal average would decide who was placed first and second. As in 1954, if the second and third placed teams finished on the same points, then there would be a play-off with the winner going through. If a play-off resulted in a draw, goal average from the group games would be used to determine who went through to the next round. If the goal averages were equal then lots would have been drawn. These arrangements had not been finalised by the time the tournament started and were still being debated as it progressed. Some teams complained that a play-off match, meaning three games in five days, was too much, and before the second round of group matches FIFA informed the teams that goal average would be used before resorting to a play-off. This was overturned when the Swedish Football Association complained, ostensibly <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> to change the rules mid-tournament, but also because it wanted the extra revenue from playoff matches.|$|E

25|$|By November 1951, Wilkins had {{evidence}} that DNA in cells {{as well as}} purified DNA had a helical structure. Alex Stokes had solved the basic mathematics of helical diffraction theory and thought that Wilkins's X-ray diffraction data indicated a helical structure in DNA. Wilkins met with Watson and Crick and told them about his results. This information from Wilkins, along with additional information gained by Watson when he heard Franklin talk about her research during a King's College research meeting, stimulated Watson and Crick to create their first molecular model of DNA, a model with the phosphate backbones at the center. Upon viewing {{the model of the}} proposed structure, Franklin told Watson and Crick <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> Franklin based this on two observations. First, experiments by J.M. Gulland showed that the CO- and NH2 groups of the bases could not be titrated, and so were probably inaccessible. Secondly, crystallographic evidence showed that the structural units of DNA were progressively separated by the addition of water, leading to the formation of a gel and then a solution. Franklin believed that the simplest explanation of this was for the hydrophilic part of the molecule to be on the outside. Crick tried to get Wilkins to continue with additional molecular modeling efforts, but Wilkins did not take this approach.|$|E

500|$|Judaism {{focuses on}} the {{importance}} of valuing this life, and as such, suicide is tantamount to denying God's goodness in the world. Despite this, under extreme circumstances when there has seemed no choice but to either be killed or forced to betray their religion, Jews have committed individual suicide or mass suicide (see Masada, First French persecution of the Jews, and York Castle for examples) and as a grim reminder there is even a prayer in the Jewish liturgy for [...] "when the knife is at the throat", for those dying [...] "to sanctify God's Name" [...] (see Martyrdom). These acts have received mixed responses by Jewish authorities, regarded by some as examples of heroic martyrdom, while others state <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> for them to take their own lives in anticipation of martyrdom.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues for}} ethical veganism: the thesis <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{typically}} <b>wrong</b> to consume animal products.

Even if we grant that we cannot both believe <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> permissible to drink milk, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> to set fire to cats, this leaves open the question of which of these judgments we should abandon. I consider and reject three strategies for addressing this question: more methodologically naïve moral theorizing, appeal to systematic normative theory, and attacking non-moral presuppositions. I argue that philosophically satisfying {{the resolution of the}} conflict requires debunking our grounds for belief in one of the conflicting claims. Finally, I argue that ethical veganism is supported by consideration of the most salient debunking arguments available...|$|R
