Of the experience she said, I {{think a lot of}} females struggle with <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>look,</b> and I wanted to show that everyone's body is different. I think it's a big deal to be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off.

BDD is a mental illness whereby an individual compulsively focuses on physical self-perceived flaws. According to a study by Rawhide, 18% of adolescent males were most worried about their weight and physique (Malcore, 2016), while 29% frequently thought about their appearances. Moreover, 50% had recently complained about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>look.</b> The main causes of male body issues on the other hand, include 25% being teased about their weight, while 33% specified social media as the source for self-consciousness. A number of respondents also admitted to being affected by negative body talk from others.|$|E

2500|$|What {{they call}} [...] "Israel" [...] is no mere {{military}} state. A subsumed militarism, a systemic mendacity with an ingrained violence constitutional {{to the very}} fusion of its fabric, has penetrated the deepest corners of what these people have to call their [...] "soul."... Half a century of systematic maiming and murdering of another people has left its deep marks {{on the faces of}} these people, the way they talk, the way they walk, the way they handle objects, the way they greet each other, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> at the world. There is an endemic prevarication to this machinery, a vulgarity of character that is bone-deep and structural to the skeletal vertebrae of its culture.|$|E
2500|$|Similar to Warhammer Fantasy Battle players, Lord of the Rings players {{commonly}} {{collect and}} paint one army (or more) {{of their choice}} and find opponents (with similarly collected armies) to play against. Armies can be built up from through the purchase of boxed sets (usually having 10 or 12 plastic miniatures in each) or [...] "blister packs" [...] (usually containing {{no more than four}} finely detailed metal or resin miniatures) to build up a reasonable-sized fighting force. Others simply collect the miniatures because they like <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>look.</b> One popular way of collecting was through Battle Games in Middle-earth — a De Agostini magazine that came with one or more free miniatures (some of which were initially exclusive to the publication) and contained detailed hobby guides.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{this style}} of filmmaking suited the filmmaker's {{intuitive}} style perfectly, giving the film a surreal, otherworldly feel. As well as being out of literally out of synch, he also accentuated the oddness by mismatching the soundtrack with what you see - often you'll find sweet and innocent dialogue accompanying grotesque and sometimes violent visuals or a South Island kea screeching on a North Auckland road. He also enjoyed giving the actors voices that were incongruous with <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked.</b>|$|R

[...] Although Vandernoot and Kirsch are three years apart in age (Vandernoot being the older of the two), on set Vandernoot treated Kirsch like a young boy, while Kirsch seemed to her like a younger brother because of his {{youthful}} appearance.|$|R
2500|$|While Griffin {{established}} {{her career}} with candid observations {{about everyday life}} and her dating experiences, later focusing on mainly mocking celebrities, her act currently consists of recounting embellished stories involving celebrities. Though her humor may be wicked, Griffin hopes people understand that no malice is intended by it. [...] "I'm genuinely a fan {{of most of the}} people I trash in the act," [...] said Griffin in an interview. [...] "I really, really try and focus on making fun of people for their behavior. I'm not so into making fun of someone for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>look,</b> or something that's out of their control." [...] Her favorite celebrity topics are plastic surgery, Scientology, alcohol intoxication, substance abuse, snooty s, eating disorders, and stars whose sexual orientation is disputed.

2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the temple's garden, over a hill {{stands the}} Hansōbō, the temple's large tutelary Shinto shrine. The {{enshrined}} spirit is the Hansōbō Daigongen. The gongen was originally the tutelary spirit (...) of Hōkō-ji in Shizuoka and was brought here in 1890 by Aozora Kandō. The statues on the stairs leading to the shrine represent Tengu, entities similar to goblins which accompany the gongen. Some of the creatures have wings and a beak: they are a type of tengu called Karasu-tengu (crow tengu) because of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>look.</b> On a clear day, from the shrine one can see Mount Fuji to the west, and Sagami bay and Izu Ōshima to the south. The stones in the garden are full of names: they are those of the faithful who donated to the temple, and which belong to over 100 different religious organizations. This area used to be the temple's Inner Sanctuary, which still stands among the trees {{at the very top of}} the hill and which can be reached going up the steep stairs that begin on the right of the shrine, in front of the Jizō-dō. Next to the sanctuary there's an observation deck from which, on clear days, are visible Kamakura, Yuigahama and Mount Fuji.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Letlive {{began writing}} on the third album. Butler said that their writing {{approach}} changed in comparison to their previous releases, as they were now doing most of it while on tour. During pre-production, the band listened to styles and ideas that, according to Butler, changed <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> at <b>the</b> songs they had initially written. The styles were their most expansive to date, and came from the diversity of their members: Butler had involved himself in the punk rock skateboarding culture when he was eleven, but had also been influenced by his father, {{who was in a}} soul band.|$|R
50|$|The çorape worn in {{the region}} of Rugova are usually white, but during the Ottoman {{presence}} they were most likely red.

60|$|She {{never tried}} again, for fear the man {{should go out}} of his mind on the spot. He {{depended}} on her.

But whatever we do, wherever we go, you won't take him away from me, Jude dear? I could not let him go now! The cloud upon his young mind makes him so pathetic to me; I do hope to lift it some day! And he loves me so. You won't take him away from me?" ...|$|E

60|$|Here were no ill-fed, whiskey-poisoned men, such as {{the rest}} of the sailors, who, having drunk up their last pay-days, had starved ashore until they had {{received}} and drunk up their advance money for the present voyage. These three, on the other hand were supple and vigorous. Their movements were spontaneously quick and accurate. Perhaps it was <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> at me, with incurious yet calculating eyes that nothing escaped. They seemed so worldly wise, so indifferent, so sure of themselves. I was confident they were not sailors. Yet, as shore-dwellers, I could not place them. They were a type I had never encountered. Possibly I can give a better idea of them by describing what occurred.|$|R
60|$|When I {{returned}} to the hotel Dick was looking for me. He carried me off up-stairs to a hall full of men.

It made me so tongue-tied that I could not find my voice when the Chief spoke to me and shook my hand warmly. He was a tall man, with a fine face and kind eyes and hair just touched with gray.|$|R
50|$|Arlington House {{suffered}} {{significant damage}} in the 2011 Virginia earthquake, requiring {{the closure of the}} back halls and upper floor pending an architectural assessment. On July 17, 2014, philanthropist David Rubenstein donated $12.5 million to the National Park Foundation (the arm of the National Park Service which raises funds through private contributions) to rehabilitate Arlington House, its outbuildings, and grounds. The 30-month project is intended to restore the mansion, buildings, and grounds to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> in 1860. <b>The</b> project will repair the earthquake-damaged foundation, and add new interior lighting and a modern climate-control system.

6000|$|... "Perhaps you think," [...] {{said the}} old man, [...] "from the way I spoke, that I don't believe them fellers with the jinted poles can ketch fish, but that ain't so. That old story about the little boy with the pin-hook who ketched all the fish, while the gentleman with the modern improvements, who stood {{alongside}} of him, kep' throwin' out his beautiful flies and never got nothin', is a pure lie. The fancy chaps, who must have ev'rythin' jist so, gen'rally gits fish. But for all that, I don't like their way of fishin', and I take no stock in it myself. I've been fishin', on and off, ever since I was a little boy, and I've caught nigh every kind there is, from the big jew-fish and cavalyoes down South, to the trout and minnies round about here. But when I ketch a fish, the first thing I do {{is to try to}} git him on the hook, and the next thing is to git him out of the water jist as soon as I kin. I don't put in no time worryin' him. There's only two animals in the world that likes to worry smaller creeturs a good while afore they kill 'em; one is the cat, and the other is what they call the game fisherman. This kind of a feller never goes after no fish that don't mind being ketched. He goes fur them kinds that loves their home in the water and hates most to leave it, and he makes it jist as hard fur 'em as he kin. What the game fisher likes is the smallest kind of a hook, the thinnest line, and a fish that it takes a good while to weaken. The longer the weak'nin' business kin be spun out, the more the sport. The idee is to let the fish think there's a chance fur him to git away. That's jist like the cat with her mouse. She lets the little creetur hop off, but the minnit he gits fur enough away, she jumps on him and jabs him with her claws, and then, if there's any game left in him, she lets him try again. Of course the game fisher could have a strong line and a stout pole and git his fish in a good sight quicker, if he wanted to, but that wouldn't be sport. He couldn't give him the butt and spin him out, and reel him in, and let him jump and run till his pluck is clean worn out. Now, I likes to git my fish ashore with all the pluck in 'em. It makes 'em taste better. And as fur fun, I'll be bound I've had jist as much of that, and more, too, than most of these fellers who are so dreadful anxious to have everythin' jist right, and think they can't go fishin' till they've spent enough money to buy a suit of Sunday clothes. As a gen'ral rule they're a solemn lot, and work pretty hard at their fun. When I work I want to be paid fur it, and when I go in fur fun I want to take it easy and cheerful. Now I wouldn't say so much agen these fellers," [...] said old Peter, as he arose and put his empty pipe on a little shelf under the porch-roof, [...] "if it wasn't for one thing, and that is, that they think that their kind of fishin' is the only kind worth considerin'. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> down upon plain Christian fishin' is enough to rile a hitchin'-post. I don't want to say nothin' agen no man's way of attendin' to his own affairs, whether it's kitchen-gardenin', or whether it's fishin', if he says nothin' agen my way; but when he looks down on me, and grins at me, I want to haul myself up, and grin at him, if I kin. And in this case, I kin. I s'pose the house-cat and the cat-fisher (by which I don't mean the man who fishes for cat-fish) was both made as they is, and they can't help it; but that don't give 'em no right to put on airs before other bein's, who gits their meat with a square kill. Good-night. And sence I've talked so much about it, I've a mind to go fishin' with you to-morrow myself." ...|$|E
