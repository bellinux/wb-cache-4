50|$|Knerr (1989) has {{reviewed}} <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> historiography {{over five}} centuries. For 150 years writers {{relied heavily on}} Petruccio Ubaldini's A Discourse Concernye the Spanish Fleete Invadinye Englande (1590), which argued that God decisively favoured the Protestant cause. William Camden (1551-1623) pointed in addition to elements of English nationalism and the private enterprise of the sea dogs. He also emphasized that the Duke of Medina Sidonia was an incompetent seaman. David Hume (1711-1776) praised the leadership of Queen Elizabeth. However the Whig historians, led by James A. Froude (1818-1894), rejected Hume's interpretation and argued that Elizabeth was vacillating and almost lost the conflict by her unwillingness to previously spend enough to maintain and supply the Royal Navy's fleet of ships. Scientific modern historiography came of age {{with the publication of}} two volumes of primary documents by John K. Laughton in 1894. This enabled the leading naval scholar of the day Julian Corbett (1854-1922) to reject the Whig views and turn attention to the professionalization of the Royal Navy as a critical factor. Twentieth-century historians have focused on technical issues, such as the comparative power of English and Spanish naval guns and the degree of naval battle tactics credit due Francis Drake and Charles Howard. Inclement weather in the English Channel and on the oceans at the time has always been cited as a major factor to the outcome.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{evidence}} regarding <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> {{the height of}} the British population since the early eighteenth century.

30|$|The kind of {{approach}} we follow is alternative to <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature, {{in the sense that}} we do not consider any convex relaxation and work directly on the non-convex OPF problem. In this way, we can guarantee adherence to the original problem and develop an algorithm which is capable of identifying local minima. This idea was originally exploited in [15] where a distributed algorithm based upon ADMM was proposed. This algorithm provided undeniable evidence of the goodness of the intuition but had two major drawbacks. First, optimization for speed was cumbersome and required centralized coordination. Second, no guarantee on convergence was available, and in fact the algorithm often failed to converge. Although the convergence failure did not practically prevent the algorithm output for being usable, convergence is an issue that practically limits the algorithm speed.|$|R
