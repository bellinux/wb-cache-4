Then, the pilgrim will be robbed in (the month of) Dhu al-Hijjah. Then, the prohibitions will be violated in (the month of) al-Muharram. <b>Then,</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be sound in (the month of) Safar, then the tribes will conflict {{with each other in}} the two months of Rabi' al-awwal & Rabi' al-thani. Then, the most amazing thing will happen between (the months of) Jumada and Rajab. Then, a well-fed she-camel will be better than a fortress (castle) sheltering a thousand (people).|$|E

25|$|Housing First was {{initiated}} by the federal government's Interagency Council on Homelessness. It asks cities {{to come up with}} a plan to end chronic homelessness under the assumption that if homeless people are given independent housing immediately with some social and financial support, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be reduced needs for emergency homeless shelters.|$|E
50|$|Gap loss can {{be caused}} by many factors, but the most common is poorly fitted {{multi-sectional}} fiber optic cables. If there is a break in a directly buried fiber optic line <b>then</b> usually <b>there</b> <b>will</b> simply be a loss of signal.|$|R

25|$|In the evening, panividai starts around 5 O’ clock. The {{door of the}} sanctum sanctorum {{is opened}} amidst {{the sound of the}} temple bells and Conch. Then, the Payyan would chant ukappatippu. Those {{followers}} who congregate for the evening panividai would repeat this. <b>Then,</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be vahana panividai. The Vahana is taken around the temple as well as the four car streets. After this, there will be Annadharmam.|$|E
25|$|Other defences include sea walls, groynes, and gabions but {{business}} {{people say that}} if the erosion is not stopped <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be millions of pounds of damage. However, one or more such groynes has had a detrimental effect further along the coast, in some areas resulting in erosion of up to twenty metres per year initially, though over the long term erosion rates have been seen to revert to their original yearly average of closer to two metres a year.|$|E
25|$|Woven {{onto the}} colours are battle honours; the Queen's Colour has honours from the First World War and Second World War, while the Regimental Colour has honours from other campaigns. The Regimental Colour {{will also have}} other distinctions, {{including}} antecedent emblems and unique honours; one significant example is the Sphinx emblem carried by regiments {{who took part in}} the Egypt campaign of 1801. If the regiment has more than a single battalion, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be identifying marks on the colours to show which battalion they belong to.|$|E

25|$|An area of {{difficulty}} is whether simply visually observing something {{amounts to a}} search. If a police officer simply sees something relating to an offence {{in the course of}} their normal duty without any conscious effort to find it <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> generally not be a search. However, cases have shown that even where there is some conscious action there may not be a search as requesting an individual hold their hands out to be observed or hold a bicycle up so the serial number could be seen were both not seen to be searches.|$|E
25|$|The Draka will {{conquer the}} world for two reasons; because we must and because we can. And yet of the two forces {{the second is the}} greater; we do this because we choose to do it. By the {{sovereign}} Will and force of arms the Draka will rule the Earth, and in so doing remake themselves. We shall conquer and beat the Nations of the Earth into the dust and reforge them in our self wrought Image; the Final Society without weakness or mercy, hard and pure. Our descendants will walk the hillside of that future, innocent beneath the stars, with no more between them and their naked will than a wolf has. <b>THEN</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be Gods in the Earth.|$|E
25|$|Another part of {{restructuring}} the movement comes from education; bell hooks {{points out that}} there is an anti-intellectual stigma among the masses. Poor people do not want to hear from intellectuals because they are different and have different ideas. As bell hooks points out though, this stigma against intellectuals leads to poor people who have risen up to become graduates of post secondary education, to be shunned because they are no longer {{like the rest of the}} masses. In order for us to achieve equality, people must be able to learn from those who have been able to smash these stereotypes. This separation leads to further inequality and in order for the feminist movement to succeed, they must be able to bridge the education gap and relate to those in the lower end of the economic sphere. If they are able to do this, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be more success and less inequality.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 2000s, the tour {{began to be}} re-examined by critics, and {{the tone of the}} {{coverage}} began to change. In 2009, an article in the BBC News singled out the Glass Spider Tour's innovative set and marriage of music and theatre as an inspiration to later acts, including Britney Spears, Madonna, U2 and others. Stage designer Willie Williams said the Glass Spider Tour was a template for those acts: [...] "There will be one set of costumes and they will do a few songs, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be another big scene change and {{move on to the next}} thing. Bowie crossing rock 'n' roll with Broadway [...] was where that began." [...] In 2010, the Glass Spider Tour won an award for being one of the best concert designs of all time (alongside other such notable tours as U2's 360° Tour [...] and Pink Floyd's Division Bell Tour [...] ).|$|E
500|$|Natural {{variation}} occurs {{among the}} individuals of any population of organisms. Some differences may improve an individual's chances of surviving and reproducing such that its lifetime reproductive rate is increased, {{which means that}} it leaves more offspring. If the traits that give these individuals a reproductive advantage are also heritable, that is, passed from parent to offspring, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be differential reproduction, that is, a slightly higher proportion of fast rabbits or efficient algae in the next generation. Even if the reproductive advantage is very slight, over many generations any advantageous heritable trait becomes dominant in the population. In this way the natural environment of an organism [...] "selects for" [...] traits that confer a reproductive advantage, causing evolutionary change, as Darwin described. This gives the appearance of purpose, but in natural selection there is no intentional choice. Artificial selection is purposive where natural selection is not, though biologists often use teleological language to describe it.|$|E
500|$|The {{season was}} {{produced}} by Bad Robot Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television. Though still set in Boston, the show's production for the second season moved from New York City to Vancouver out of financial necessity, as it lost access to New York's TV production tax incentive program. Fringe consequently got a mostly new writing staff and production team, though co-creators J.J. Abrams, Roberto Orci, and Alex Kurtzman, and producer Bryan Burk remained involved with the series. Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman returned as executive producers and showrunners. Jeff Vlaming and previous episode director Akiva Goldsman joined the crew as consulting producers. While Abrams had six episode writing credits for the first season he remained much more hands-off for the second, instead focusing on other commitments like the film Star Trek. He explained, [...] "Sometimes we'll talk every day. <b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be {{a period of a}} couple weeks where we don't speak. But we're emailing a lot. There's a lot of stuff that happens that way." [...] Eden FX and Zoic Studios stayed as vendors for the series' visual effects, effectively giving Fringe a sense of continuity. Jay Worth, the overall visual effects supervisor, commented that having these two companies [...] "helped the show not feel as a big of a bump from one season to the next, particularly with different crews and a different vibe a little bit." [...] Despite his decreased involvement, Abrams was sent all of the visual effects for the series during production, and responded back with notes and tweaks.|$|E

2500|$|The lattice {{structure}} {{in each of}} the thin film cells needs to be the same. [...] If it is not <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be losses. [...] The processes used for depositing the layers are complex. [...] They include Molecular Beam Epitaxy and Metal Organic Vapour Phase Epitaxy. [...] The current efficiency record is made with this process but doesn't have exact matching lattice constants. [...] The losses due to this are not as effective because the differences in lattices allows for more optimal band gap material for the first two cells.

2500|$|French {{children}} are {{told a story}} in which they imagine having a pond with water lily leaves floating on the surface. The lily population doubles in size every day and if left unchecked will smother the pond in 30 days, killing all the other living things in the water. Day after day the plant seems small {{and so it is}} decided to leave it to grow until it half-covers the pond, before cutting it back. They are then asked on what day half-coverage will occur.

2500|$|Montgomery was {{determined}} that the Army, Navy and Air Forces should fight their battles in a unified, focused manner according to a detailed plan. He ordered immediate reinforcement of the vital heights of Alam Halfa, just behind his own lines, expecting the German commander, Erwin Rommel, to attack with the heights as his objective, something that Rommel soon did. Montgomery ordered all contingency plans for retreat to be destroyed. [...] "I have cancelled the plan for withdrawal. If we are attacked, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be no retreat. If we cannot stay here alive, then we will stay here dead", he told his officers at the first meeting he held {{with them in the}} desert, though, in fact, Auchinleck had no plans to withdraw from the strong defensive position he had chosen and established at El Alamein.|$|E
