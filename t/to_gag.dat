25|$|Between 5 and 8 March, {{police would}} find six further bodies of young females at 25 Cromwell Street. Each victim had been {{extensively}} mutilated, and each body bore evidence {{of having been}} subjected to extreme sexual abuse prior to the act of murder. For example, the third set of remains discovered in the cellar was found with a length of cloth wrapped around the skull, and an oval of adhesive tape 16 inches in circumference found with the remains had likely been used <b>to</b> <b>gag</b> this victim, whose ankles and wrists were also bound with a large section of rope. Also found in this grave was a large, serrated knife. The second set of remains was found with a section of tubing twisted into a U-shape alongside her severed limbs, and her skull was found encased in adhesive tape which had been wrapped around the section where her face had been 11 or 12 times, with a narrow plastic tube inserted where the nasal cavities had been in an obvious effort to facilitate her breathing prior to her murder. Each set of remains was missing numerous bones, particularly phalange bones, although when questioned as to this ominous paradigm, Fred refused to divulge the reason or whereabouts of the bones missing from each set of remains.|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} {{pathogenesis}} of lupus nephritis, the cross reactivity between anti-DNA antibody and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) was investigated. Monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies were obtained from hybridomas by the fusion of MRL/lpr/lpr splenocytes with murine myeloma cells. Some of these monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies showed cross reactivity with GAGs, such as hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate. To elucidate the mechanism of cross reactivity, inhibition assays with propanol and polyethylenimine (PEI), a cationic agent, were carried out. Increase of the concentration of PEI (0. 6 - 2. 0 % vol/vol) resulted in a dose dependent decrease in the binding ability of anti-DNA antibody <b>to</b> <b>GAGs.</b> Propanol, an organic reagent which disrupts the van der Waals bonds between epitopes and paratopes, showed little inhibitory effect on the binding activity of monoclonal anti-DNA antibody <b>to</b> <b>GAGs.</b> These {{results indicate that the}} binding of anti-DNA antibody <b>to</b> <b>GAGs</b> is due <b>to</b> a charge interaction rather than van der Waals forces.

2500|$|On 15 May 1995, three police {{officers}} from the ADG stood trial accused of Gardner's manslaughter.

Paula Lannas, a forensic pathologist, testified: [...] "There were bruises on the scalp that indicates the head had struck a hard surface. The lack of oxygen was secondary to the head injury.

40|$|We used ELISA {{and flow}} cytometry {{to study the}} binding of prion protein PrP <b>to</b> glycosaminoglycans (<b>GAGs).</b> We found that {{recombinant}} human PrP (rPrP) binds GAGs including chondroitin sulphate A, chondroitin sulphate B, hyaluronic acid, and heparin. rPrP binding <b>to</b> <b>GAGs</b> occurs via the N-terminus, a region known to bind divalent cations. Additionally, rPrP binding <b>to</b> <b>GAGs</b> is enhanced {{in the presence of}} Cu 2 + and Zn 2 +, but not Ca 2 + and Mn 2 +. rPrP binds heparin strongest, and the binding is inhibited by certain heparin analogues, including heparin disaccharide and sulphate-containing monosaccharides, but not by acetylated heparin. Full-length normal cellular prion protein (PrPC), but not N-terminally truncated PrPC species, from human brain bind GAGs in a similar Cu 2 +/Zn 2 +-enhanced fashion. We found that <b>GAGs</b> specifically bind <b>to</b> a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 23 - 35 in the N-terminus of rPrP. We further demonstrated that while both wild-type PrPC and an octapeptide-repeat-deleted mutant PrP produced by transfected cells bound heparin at the cell surface, the PrP N-terminal deletion mutant and non-transfectant control failed to bind heparin. Binding of heparin to wild-type PrPC on the cell surface results in a reduction of the level of cell-surface PrPC. These results provide strong evidence that PrPC is a surface receptor for GAGs...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHighlights Glycosaminoglycans play a {{key role}} in the {{cellular}} uptake of the cationic peptide PACAP. PACAP binding <b>to</b> <b>GAGs</b> induces a random coil-to-α-helix conformational conversion. PACAP α-helix is necessary for efficient internalization mediated by cell surface GAGs. Abstract Glycosaminoglycans (<b>GAGs)</b> contribute <b>to</b> the cellular uptake of cationic cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). However, molecular details about the contributions of GAGs in CPP internalization remain unclear. In this study, we examined the cellular uptake mechanism of the arginine-rich CPP pituitary adenylate-cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP). We observed that the uptake efficacy of PACAP is dependent on the expression of cell surface GAGs. As the binding of PACAP <b>to</b> sulfated <b>GAGs</b> induced a random coil-to-α-helix conformational conversion, we investigated the role of the helical formation in PACAP internalization. Whereas this secondary structure was not crucial for efficient internalization in GAGs-deficient cells, PACAP α-helix was essential for GAGs-dependent uptake...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aims: Bleomycin is a {{clinically}} used anti-cancer {{drug that}} produces DNA breaks once inside of cells. However, bleomycin is a positively charged molecule and cannot get inside of cells by free diffusion. We previously {{reported that the}} cell surface negatively charged glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) {{may be involved in}} the cellular uptake of bleomycin. We also observed that a class of positively charged small molecules has Golgi localization once inside of the cells. We therefore hypothesized that bleomycin might perturb Golgi-operated GAG biosynthesis. Methods: We used stable isotope labeling coupled with LC/MS analysis of GAG disaccharides simultaneously from bleomycin-treated and non-treated cancer cells. To further understand the cytotoxicity of bleomycin and its relationship <b>to</b> <b>GAGs,</b> we used sodium chlorate <b>to</b> inhibit <b>GAG</b> sulfation and commercially available <b>GAGs</b> <b>to</b> compete for cell surface GAG/bleomycin interactions in seven cell lines including CHO 745 defective in both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis. Results: we discovered that heparan sulfate GAG was significantly undersulfated and the quantity and disaccharide compositions of GAGs were changed in bleomycin-treated cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. We revealed that bleomycin-induced cytotoxicity was directly related <b>to</b> cell surface <b>GAGs.</b> Conclusion: GAGs were targeted by bleomycin both at cell surface and at Golgi. Thus, GAGs might be the biological relevant molecules that might be related to the bleomycin-induced fibrosis in certain cancer patients, a severe side effect with largely unknown molecular mechanism...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHerpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) {{entry into}} {{permissive}} cells involves attachment <b>to</b> cell-surface glycosaminoglycans (<b>GAGs)</b> and fusion {{of the virus}} envelope with the cell membrane triggered by the binding of glycoprotein D (gD) to cognate receptors. In this study, we characterized the observation that soluble forms of the gD ectodomain (sgD) can mediate entry of gD-deficient HSV- 1. We examined the efficiency and receptor specificity of this activity and used sequential incubation protocols to determine the order and stability of the initial interactions required for entry. Surprisingly, virus binding <b>to</b> <b>GAGs</b> did not increase the efficiency of sgD-mediated entry and gD-deficient virus was capable of attaching to GAG-deficient cells {{in the absence of}} sgD.

40|$|To {{understand}} cartilage degenerative {{diseases and}} improve repair procedures, we investigate {{the influence of}} glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on cartilage matrix biochemistry and functionality. Bovine articular chondrocytes were cultured in alginate beads with(out) para-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xyloside (PNPX) <b>to</b> inhibit <b>GAG</b> incorporation into newly formed proteoglycans. As expected, GAG deposition in alginate beads decreased with increasing PNPX concentration. Next <b>to</b> <b>GAGs,</b> collagen deposition and cross-linking also decreased. In the presence of PNPX, GAGs and collagen were deposited further away from the chondrocyte than in the control and increased amounts {{were found in the}} culture medium. These changes resulted in decreased functional properties of the construct. We conclude that in our culture system, intact proteoglycans play a role in deposition of collagen and thus the formation of a functional matrix. The effect of less proteoglycans on the collagen network could explain why cartilage repair is ineffective in osteoarthritis and help us with development of new therapies. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.
