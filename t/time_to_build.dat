5|$|In 1715, Philippe de Vendôme made {{a second}} proposal, this <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a casemated redoubt. A year later, René Jacob de Tigné {{proposed}} {{the construction of}} a large artillery battery, similar to other coastal batteries that were being built around Malta's coastline at the time.|$|E
5|$|Near Borough station the new tunnels would branch off via a new {{station to}} form an {{interchange}} with the SE and the LB at London Bridge mainline station. The tunnels would then pass {{to the east of}} London Bridge, north through the City of London to Angel. Following a delay, during which a Joint Select Committee reviewed the proposals of several new underground railways, the City and South London Railway Act, 1893 received royal assent on 24 August 1893. The Act also incorporated another bill of 1893 to grant an extension of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the southern extension to Clapham.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 2011, Ian Thorpe {{announced}} that he would try to qualify for the 2012 Olympics in London. Thorpe's major focus was the 100m and 200m freestyle at 2012's trials, stating he could offer the most value to the Australian team in the relays. He would not swim the 400m, claiming he would not have enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> up endurance for that event. This led many to see a renewed rivalry with Michael Phelps.|$|E
50|$|Rocks {{have been}} used in Neolithic <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> dolmens. These are found at La Hougue Bie in St. Saviour and Le Mont Ubé dolmen, St. Clément and La Pouquelaye de Faldouet and Le Couperon.|$|R
5000|$|Near the harbour of Ponta Delgada a {{broad gauge}} railway was used several <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> and enlarge the harbor. The track used a seven-foot gauge, {{but it is}} unclear if this was Isambard Kingdom Brunel's [...] Brunel gauge.|$|R

5|$|There were {{numerous}} proposals at the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> an electric aerial tramway, with one such line {{to go down}} the Avenida de Mayo. One proposal was the 1889 Le Tellier proposal, which envisioned multiple lines running along the city's wider avenues with the trams moved using cables and would hang from steel rails fixed to 6 metre high steel and iron posts positioned in 10–15 metre intervals. The lines would take 24 months to build and construction would commence 3 months after their approval by the Argentine National Congress, a decision which was ultimately not taken, favouring instead an underground tramway.|$|E
5|$|George Smith {{established}} a second distillery during 1849, named the Cairngorm-Delnabo Distillery but by 1855 or 1856, both distilleries were running at full capacity, and {{were unable to}} meet rising demand. The operation of two separate sites was also proving difficult and expensive, so plans were formed around the same <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a new, larger distillery further down the hill at Minmore. Construction of this new distillery was underway when the old Upper Drumin distillery was destroyed by fire during 1858. Construction of the new Minmore distillery was sped up and salvageable equipment from the Upper Drumin distillery {{was transferred to the}} new Mimmore distillery. The Delnabo distillery was closed {{at the same time and}} the best parts of the equipment were also transferred to the Minmore plant. Production commenced at the new plant during 1859 and it was around the same time the legal entity of George & J.G. Smith, Ltd. was formed.|$|E
5|$|In November 1891, the C {{recognised}} the {{deficiencies of}} the section between Borough station and King William Street. A new route was chosen with a different pair of tunnels, avoiding this section. Near Borough, the new tunnels would branch off to London Bridge to form an interchange with the mainline station and then north through the City of London to Angel. The plan was approved on 24 August 1893 following a delay. The Act also incorporated another bill of 1893 to grant more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the southern extension to Clapham. The new route and {{the first section of}} the northern extension from Borough to Moorgate opened on 25 February 1900, and the King William Street diversion was closed. The southern extension to Clapham Common opened on 3 June 1900. Work continued {{on the rest of the}} northern extension and it opened on 17 November 1901.|$|E
50|$|A mineral line {{ran down}} to the station from Corncockle Quarry, a large and {{historically}} important sandstone quarry near Templand. Stone from this quarry was used in Victorian <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> tenements in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Dinosaur footprints were found there in the 19th century.|$|R
5000|$|In those <b>times,</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> {{a kingdom}} from an {{aggregation}} of small states was itself no great difficulty... But {{to keep the}} state intact after it had been formed was a colossal task...

5000|$|A [...] "standard build unit" [...] ("SBU") is a {{term used}} during initial {{bootstrapping}} of the system, and represents the amount of <b>time</b> required <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the first package in LFS on a given computer. Its creation was prompted by the long <b>time</b> required <b>to</b> <b>build</b> an LFS system, and the desire of many users to know how long a source tarball will take <b>to</b> <b>build</b> ahead of <b>time.</b>|$|R
5|$|With the ROK army in retreat, the 766th Regiment, 549th Unit, and KPA's 5th Divisions all {{advanced}} steadily {{south along}} the eastern roads without encountering much resistance. Across the entire front the North Korean Army had successfully routed the South Koreans and was pushing them south. The 766th Regiment acted as an advance force, attempting to infiltrate further inland as it moved through the mountainous eastern region of the country. The rugged terrain of the eastern regions of Korea, poor communication equipment, and unreliable resupply lines thwarted the South Korean resistance. The North Koreans used this to their advantage in advancing but they began to experience the same problems themselves. The 5th Division and the two other units began advancing south slowly and cautiously, sending strong reconnaissance parties into the mountains to ensure {{they would not be}} threatened from the rear. However, this more cautious advance began to give the South Koreans valuable <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> up further south. By June 28, the 766th had infiltrated into Taebaek-san from Uljin and was moving toward Ilwolsan, Yongyang and Cheongsong in order to block communications between Daegu and Busan, where United States Army forces were landing in an attempt to support the collapsing ROK Army.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{eventually}} follow Evan to Congress. When Long discovers this, {{he allows}} Evan latitude at first, but warns {{him that he}} will no longer tolerate it if it happens again in the future. Meanwhile, Evan's staffers are outraged by his change of appearance and behavior. When Evan returns to the ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells Evan that the flood will likely come at mid-day on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God has been talking to him and is responsible for his new look and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but he soon realizes that God will not allow him {{to take it off}} and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later. The next time Evan arrives at Congress for work, animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into his robe halfway through the session. Evan reluctantly explains his divine mission, although Long does not take him seriously, and Evan is fired from Congress and later removed his name from the Public Land Act bill. Evan deduces that God purposely had him fired from Congress, so that he would have more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the ark. In continued skepticism, Joan leaves Evan alone after believing that he was going insane.|$|E
5|$|Starting with {{an empty}} hospital, the player must build rooms and hire doctors, nurses, {{handymen}} and receptionists. Each staff member has statistics that affect their performance, and doctors can be trained so their statistics will increase. Rooms include GP's Offices, Psychiatric rooms, Operating Theatres and Pharmacies, and are built by placing down a blueprint, assigning the location of doors and windows, and then placing down required and optional pieces of furniture. The player may also set up items such as benches, fire extinguishers, and plants in the open corridor spaces provided. The player is given <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the hospital {{at the start of}} each level before patients start coming. Patients see a GP in his office who either provides a diagnosis or sends them for further evaluation in a specialised diagnosis room. Once a diagnosis is made, the patient will be sent for treatment. While a few rooms are available {{at the start of the}} game, the rest must be researched. Some rooms, such as the Inflator room—where patients with Bloaty Head are treated—contain machines which require regular maintenance by a handyman: if neglected for too long, they will explode, killing all occupants of the room. Doctors must have acquired certain specialist skills to practise in certain rooms, such as the Research room (used to research new rooms and cures, and improve existing ones) and Operating Theatre. There are rooms that only staff use, such as the Staff Room and the Research room, while patients also require certain rooms such as toilet facilities.|$|E
50|$|The {{operator}} {{of each individual}} station was provided with lodging and paid a commission on sales. The Whiting family reinvested profit from the stations, which continued even through the hardest economic <b>times,</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> additional fuel stations and motels.

25|$|The {{estimated}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> {{the aircraft}} from the kit is 400–500 hours, or 250 hours from the quick-build kit. By late 2011 more than 155 Classics were flying.|$|E
25|$|The overall <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the Hasholme logboat would {{directly}} {{depend on}} the number of men involved. Based on other ethnographic evidence {{it has been estimated that}} the total time taken would have been roughly one month. Even though building a log-boat was always a communal effort, the complexity of the bow and stern sections suggest that a master boat builder with specialized knowledge must have been employed in this case.|$|E
25|$|The defenders' {{position}} on Kos, never enviable, soon became serious and, presently, desperate, for the Italian anti-aircraft defence was negligible {{and their own}} resources meagre. To add to their troubles, the area round the airfield they had to protect was too rocky to permit digging in, {{and there was no}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> blast walls before the enemy was upon them. The air attacks were so severe that casualties inflicted on the British paratroopers forced them to be withdrawn on 25 September.|$|E

25|$|The {{generators}} {{were built}} at the Washington Navy Yard by master joiners who fashioned a contraption of copper plumbing and tanks which, when filled with sulfuric acid and iron filings, would yield hydrogen gas. The generators were Lowe's own design and were considered a marvel of engineering. They were designed to be loaded into box crates that could easily fit on a standard buckboard. The generators took more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> than the balloons and were not as readily available as the first balloon.|$|E
25|$|Deep shelters {{provided}} most {{protection against}} a direct hit. The {{government did not}} build them for large populations before the war because of cost, <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> and fears that their safety would cause occupants to refuse to leave {{to return to work}} or that anti-war sentiment would develop in large congregations of civilians. The government saw the leading role taken by the Communist Party in advocating the building deep shelters as an attempt to damage civilian morale, especially after the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939.|$|E

In 1996, the resort was purchased outright, for $43 million, due to the high success of the resort, although Disney still owns the land on which the resort sits.|$|E
25|$|Although all {{the four}} credit {{information}} companies have developed their individual credit scores, {{the most popular}} is CIBIL credit score. The CIBIL credit score is a three-digit number that represents a summary of individuals' credit history and credit rating. This score ranges from 300 to 900, with 900 being the best score. Individuals with no credit history will have a score of -1. If the credit history is less than six months, the score will be 0. CIBIL credit score takes <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> up and usually it takes between 18 and 36 months or more of credit usage to obtain a satisfactory credit score.|$|E
