However, at the medal ceremony he walked off the podium and dropped his medal on the mat in protest of the judging in his event.

Sultan Iskandar took up the initiative to obtain more royal support to stall {{the implementation of the}} proposed bill. The bill, which proposed <b>to</b> <b>strip</b> rulers and members of the royal families of legal immunity, would make them prosecutable by the law in any cases of proven criminal wrongdoings.|$|E

40|$|Exposed thiol {{groups do}} not appear to be related to the binding of 32 P-labelled polyribosomes <b>to</b> <b>stripped</b> rough {{endoplasmic}} reticulum in vitro. Treating stripped rough endoplasmic reticulum with GSSG did not diminish binding of polyribosomes, suggesting that binding in vitro has no correlation with the inhibition of protein synthesis in vitro reported by Kosower et al. (1971). Thiol reagents, which are known to dissociate ribosomes, did not significantly decrease binding of 32 P-labelled polyribosomes <b>to</b> <b>stripped</b> rough endoplasmic reticulum. Denaturing the protein of 32 P-labelled polyribosomes or stripped rough endoplasmic reticulum of liver or hepatoma with heat, trichloroacetic acid, or HClO 4 did not alter the binding in vitro. Therefore, the practice of measuring the binding of 32 P-labelled polyribosomes <b>to</b> <b>stripped</b> rough endoplasmic reticulum in vitro (Shires et al., 1971 b) is an unsuitable indicator of biological significance in the intact cell...|$|R

5|$|Chacoan flora typifies that of North American high deserts: {{sagebrush}} {{and several}} species of cactus are interspersed with dry scrub forests of piñon and juniper, the latter primarily on the mesa tops. The canyon is far drier than other parts of New Mexico located at similar latitudes and elevations, and it lacks the temperate coniferous forests plentiful to the east. The prevailing sparseness of plants and wildlife was echoed in ancient times, when overpopulation, expanding cultivation, overhunting, habitat destruction, and drought may have led the Chacoans <b>to</b> <b>strip</b> the canyon of wild plants and game. It {{has been suggested that}} even during wet periods the canyon was able to sustain only 2,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's {{writing was}} shaped by {{his work as a}} {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something he sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove <b>to</b> <b>strip</b> unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the siege, Colonel John Carter was appointed governor of the castle and fresh repairs were carried out. In 1655 the Council of State appointed by Parliament ordered the castle to be slighted, or put beyond military use: the Bakehouse tower was probably deliberately partially pulled down at this time as part of the slighting. With the restoration of Charles II in 1660, Conway was returned to Edward Conway, the Earl of Conway, but five years later Edward decided <b>to</b> <b>strip</b> the remaining iron and lead from the castle and sell it off. The work was completed under the supervision of Edward Conway's overseer William Milward, despite opposition from the leading citizens of Conwy, and turned the castle into a total ruin.|$|E

5|$|Macrinus {{had several}} {{issues that he}} needed to deal with {{at the time of his}} accession, which had been left behind by his predecessor. As Caracalla had a {{tendency}} towards military belligerence, rather than diplomacy, this left several conflicts for Macrinus to resolve. Additionally, Caracalla had been a profligate spender of Rome's income. Most of the money was spent on the army; he had greatly increased their pay from 2,000 sesterces to 3,000 sesterces per year. The increased expenditures forced Caracalla <b>to</b> <b>strip</b> bare whatever sources of income he had to supply the difference.
