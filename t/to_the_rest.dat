5|$|In the 15th century, the Renaissance spread rapidly {{from its}} birthplace in Florence <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of Italy and soon <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of Europe. The {{invention}} of the printing press by German printer Johannes Gutenberg allowed the rapid transmission of these new ideas. As it spread, its ideas diversified and changed, being adapted to local culture. In the 20th century, scholars began to break the Renaissance into regional and national movements.|$|E
