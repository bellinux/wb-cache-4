5000|$|This type had two {{stepping}} coils with pawls and ratchets, one {{to raise}} the wipers to the desired banks of contacts, and one to rotate the wipers into the banks. These were commonly used in telephone switching with ten banks of ten contacts. The coils were typically driven by the electrical pulses derived from a rotary telephone dial. On a <b>two-motion</b> <b>selector,</b> as a digit was dialed, the wipers would step up the banks, then automatically rotate (self-step) into the selected bank until they found an [...] "unused" [...] outlet to the next switch stage. The last two digits dialed would operate the connector switch (final selector in Britain). The second to last digit would cause the wipers to move up and the last digit would cause them to rotate into the bank to the called customer's line outlet. If the line was idle then ringing voltage would {{be applied to the}} called line and ringing tone was sent to the calling line.|$|E
50|$|To make a call, the subscriber's uni{{selector}} seizes a free 1st code selector, {{which in}} turn seizes an A-digit selector via an A-digit hunter uniselector. The A-digit selector returns dial tone, steps to the first dialled digit and searches for a free director from that group. The director includes a <b>two-motion</b> <b>selector</b> - the BC switch - which steps vertically and then horizontally according to the two BC digits. This selector has 6 banks to permit up to 6 pulse trains to be generated by the director to step the code selectors; the bank contacts are strapped via a translation field to indicate the digit required (or to a DCO lead to indicate that all translation digits have been sent). The pulse train output begins after the C-digit is received from the subscriber's telephone. This is generated {{under the control of}} the send switch uniselector as it searches for the marks provided by the translation field straps for the exchange code received. Meanwhile, the subscriber has continued to dial and the four digits of the numerical portion of the number are stored on four more uniselectors. These set up four more marks, and after completing the output of the code translation the send switch uniselector searches for them in turn in order to forward the numerical digits unchanged to step the numerical selectors at the terminating exchange.|$|E
