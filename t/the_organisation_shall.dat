The empirical investigation is built on a semi structured interview that was conducted on nine different companies in Gislaveds community. The companies were from three different branches namely: tree, metal and polymer. Three interviews were conducted in each branch. The result from the interviews showed that the globalisation had put the companies under hard competition which had made the need for rationalisation and effectivness more apparent. Having said this, the demands on the organisation and the individuals within it will constantly increase. In order to enhance the individuals and the organisation there are an increased need for flexibility and openness and the responsibility and authority must be with in the individuals in the organisation.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years the {{concepts}} of knowledge management and knowledge sharing have been recognised as cognate areas of study and research. To date research has focussed mainly upon the commercial sector. However this paper looks at knowledge management and sharing through communities of practice within the voluntary sector. The work is based upon research carried out within a UK national voluntary counselling and advisory service. For reasons of privacy and confidentiality <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>shall</b> remain anonymous and will be referred to as the ‘organisation’. The term Knowledge Management (KM), has been around for some time, and has primarily been concerned with the capability of various software products to handle ‘knowledge’. However during the 1990 ’s there was a shift away from these technological issues and towards people. The research project upon which this paper is based is people-focussed employing the Grounded Theory Method (discussed below). Contemporary theories of Knowledge concentrate on the human dynamic emphasising that this {{is more important than the}} tools designed to store and network information (Foskett 1990; Streatfield and Wilson 1999; Orlikowski 2000; Prusak 2001). Whilst KM has been treated as a scientific discipline by those who have focussed mostly upon the exploitation of IT there have been some qualitative studies, which have explored the human side of Knowledge Management, and in particular have studied communities of people in the context of knowledge. It is important to study people and groups of people because ‘most practitioners…have begun to study networks and communities as the most productive units of analysis for doing knowledge work ’ (Prusak 2001). Accordingly links to sociology and anthropology, have been explored by Snowden (2000), Delanty (2001) and Scharmer (2001), amongst others...|$|E

[...] "They {{say that}} he has 30,000 fighting-men, and in that case he {{ought to be able to}} overrun both Natal and the Transvaal, for there is no doubt that Zulus fight with great bravery. As for the Dutch, I really can't blame the Zulus. The Boers are always encroaching on their territory, and any remonstrance is answered by a rifle-shot. Had it not been for our annexation of the Transvaal, Cetewayo would have overrun it and exterminated the Dutch before now. We have a strong force in the colony just at present, and I think Sir Bartle Frere means to bring matters to a crisis. The existence of such an army of warlike savages on the frontier is a standing threat to the very existence of the colony, and the constitution of the army renders it almost a necessity that it should fight. All the men are soldiers, and as none are allowed to marry until the regiment to which they belong has distinguished itself in battle they are naturally always burning for war. The Pieter-Maritzburg paper says that it understands that Sir Bartle Frere is about to send in an ultimatum, demanding--in addition to various small matters, such as the punishing of raiders across the frontier--the entire abandonment of the present system of the Zulu army, and cessation of the bloody massacres which constantly take place in that country. If a man offends the king, not only is he put to death, but the whole of the people of his village are often massacred. Altogether an abominable state of things prevails; there seems to be but one opinion throughout the colony, that it is absolutely necessary for our safety that <b>the</b> Zulu <b>organisation</b> <b>shall</b> be broken up." ...|$|R

40|$|Background: The age of technology, where {{information}} and knowledge perform {{important roles in}} the organisational context, creates an opportunity for local government organisations (such as metropolitan municipalities) in South Africa to support knowledge–sharing. One such technology that supports knowledge–sharing is an intranet. If an intranet is not effectively managed, knowledge–sharing in an <b>organisation</b> <b>shall</b> not be augmented. Objective: To investigate whether or not an intranet augments knowledge–sharing in <b>the</b> selected <b>organisation</b> of eThekwini Municipality. Methods: In this study a quantitative research approach was adopted. Results: The results of this survey suggest that firstly the intranet appears {{to be at a}} medium maturity level; secondly, whilst there is information sharing, the intranet {{does not appear to be}} effective as a knowledge–sharing structure; and thirdly there appears to be scope for improvement of the content on the intranet. The implication thereof is that eThekwini Municipality’s recently formed Municipal Institute of Learning (MILE) may be ideally poised to address the identified shortcomings. Conclusion: Intranet technology plays an important role in an <b>organisation</b> by enabling <b>the</b> effective acquisition, sharing and presentation of knowledge. Because of this an intranet must be effectively managed to readily augment knowledge–sharing in the organisational context of local government organisations (such as metropolitan municipalities) in South Africa. </p...|$|R
