5|$|According to Cloud {{and other}} modern {{professional}} historians of Roman history, {{a fundamental shift}} in the punishment of murderers may have occurred {{towards the end of}} the third century BCE, possibly spurred on by specific incidents like that of Lucius Hostius' murder of his father, and, more generally, occasioned by the concomitant brutalization of society in the wake of the protracted wars with Hannibal. Previously, murderers would have been handed over to the family of the victim to exact their vengeance, whereas from the second century BCE and onwards, the punishment of murderers became the affair of the Roman state, rather than, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> offended family was given full licence in how to mete out what they deemed to be an appropriate punishment to the murderer of a family member. Within that particular context, Cloud points out, specifically, that certain jokes contained in the plays of the early 2nd century dramatist Plautus may be read to refer to the recent introduction of the punishment by the sack for parricides in particular (without the animals involved).|$|E

Because this decision alone was grounds for reversal of the California Supreme Court decision, the Court saw no need to address the second and third contentions.|$|E
25|$|Hungry Jack's {{also argued}} that the Development Agreement {{included}} an implied term of good faith (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> parties must act in good faith when exercising their rights under the contract), and that Burger King had breached this term by denying the financial and operating approval to new restaurants, leading to Hungry Jack's failing to meet the minimum stores requirement.

25|$|It was {{traditionally}} thought (especially by the Aristotelians) {{that the}} air did not have lateral weight: <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> kilometers of air above the surface did not exert any weight on the bodies below it. Even Galileo had accepted the weightlessness of air as a simple truth. Torricelli questioned that assumption, and instead proposed that air had weight {{and that it was}} the latter (not the attracting force of the vacuum) which held (or rather, pushed) up the column of water. He thought that the level the water stayed at (c. 10.3m) was reflective of the force of the air's weight pushing on it (specifically, pushing on the water in the basin and thus limiting how much water can fall from the tube into it). In other words, he viewed the barometer as a balance, an instrument for measurement (as opposed to merely being an instrument to create a vacuum), and because {{he was the first to}} view it this way, he is traditionally considered the inventor of the barometer (in the sense in which we now use the term).|$|E

The 1936 Wisden said that, [...] "owing to illness", Young had not stood as an umpire in any first-class matches in 1935 and had withdrawn from the umpires list for 1936. In fact, Young died at his home in Bath on 2 April 1936 just before the cricket season started. He was 45.|$|R

In response, Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary, repealed the 1971 Order in Council and announced he would not appeal against the decision, allowing the Chagossians to return home.|$|E

500|$|Shahîd's {{position}} {{is reinforced by}} C. H. Roberts and A. N. Sherwin-White, who reviewed his Rome and the Arabs before publication. [...] <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> proper interpretation of κατέχει λόγος is as {{a reference to a}} written account. Roberts notes that Χριστιανὸν ὄντα (Christianon onta, [...] "being a Christian") was probably an editorial insertion by Eusebius, and not included in the logos he relates in the passage. Shahîd takes this as an indication that Eusebius did indeed vouch for Philip's Christianity. Roberts suggested that κατέχει λόγος might be translated as [...] "there is a wide-spread report", but added that a broader study of Eusebius' use of the expression elsewhere would be useful. Sherwin-White points out Eusebius' use of the phrase in his passage on the Thundering Legion (at Historia Ecclesiastica 5.5), where it represents a reference to written sources.|$|E
500|$|While it {{eventually}} became a bestseller in the United States, The Red Badge of Courage was more popular and sold more rapidly in England when {{it was published in}} late 1895. Crane was delighted with his novel's success overseas, writing to a friend: [...] "I have only one pride and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> English edition of The Red Badge of Courage has been [...] with great praise by the English reviewers. I am proud of this simply because the remoter people would seem more just and harder to win." [...] Critic, veteran and Member of Parliament George Wyndham called the novel a [...] "masterpiece", applauding Crane's ability to [...] "stage the drama of man, so to speak, within the mind of one man, and then admits you as to a theatre." [...] Harold Frederic wrote in his own review that [...] "If there were in existence any books of a similar character, one could start confidently by saying that it was the best of its kind. But it has no fellows. It is a book outside of all classification. So unlike anything else is it that the temptation rises to deny that it is a book at all". Frederic, who would later befriend Crane when the latter relocated to England in 1897, juxtaposed the novel's treatment of war to those by Leo Tolstoy, Émile Zola and Victor Hugo, all of whose works he believed to be [...] "positively... cold and ineffectual" [...] when compared to The Red Badge of Courage.|$|E
