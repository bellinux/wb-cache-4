5|$|Dazed {{survivors}} immediately {{feared that}} the explosion {{was the result of}} a bomb dropped from a German plane. Troops at gun batteries and barracks immediately <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> case the city was under attack, but within an hour switched from defence to rescue roles as the cause and location of the explosion were determined. All available troops were called in from harbour fortifications and barracks to the North End to rescue survivors and provide transport to the city's hospitals, including the two army hospitals in the city.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th {{century and}} 19th century, more Arab blood was added by stallions who were <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the Welsh hills. Other breeds {{have also been}} added, {{including}} the Thoroughbred, Hackney, Norfolk Roadster, and the Yorkshire Coach Horse. Before the car was developed, the quickest mode of transport in Wales was the Welsh Cob. Tradesmen, doctors, and other businessmen often selected ponies by trotting them the 35 uphill miles from Cardiff to Dowlais. The best ponies could complete this feat in under three hours, never breaking gait. Formal breeding stock licensing was introduced in 1918, but before this, breeding stock was selected by such trotting tests.|$|E

5|$|Millions <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> {{major cities}} across Egypt on the 25th, {{especially}} in Cairo's Tahrir Square. In the beginning, tensions were high between {{the police and}} protesters with violence breaking out in Suez and Alexandria. The government took a hard line, using riot-control tactics, and shutting down communications; But by the 28th the protests were continuing and the police had retreated. The security role {{was taken over by}} the military, and from then on the situation remained almost entirely peaceful. As pressure rose on Mubarak, the scale of the protests continued to grow, especially on specially organized Friday rallies.|$|E
5|$|Several {{variations}} of the Maunsell green, Urie sage green and Bulleid malachite green liveries were tried with black, white/black, and yellow lining, some sporting a green panel on the smoke deflectors. However, from 1942 to 1946, during the Second World War, {{members of the class}} under overhaul were <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> unlined-black livery as a wartime economy measure, with green-shaded sunshine yellow lettering. The final Southern livery used from 1946 reverted to malachite green, with yellow/black lining, and sunshine yellow lettering. Some of the class (Nos.782 and 800, Sir Brian and Sir Persant) did not receive this livery.|$|E

5|$|Fixtures between Millwall and West Ham United are {{currently}} categorised by the Metropolitan Police as category C– games which carry {{a high risk}} of disorder amongst supporters. For the 2011–12 season, the Metropolitan Police implemented London-wide operations to ensure that the games passed by without any incident. In 2013 a member of West Ham's hooligan Inter City Firm was jailed for 12 months for organising violence between West Ham and Millwall fans during an FA Cup match between Dagenham & Redbridge and Millwall on 7 January 2012. He chose this game in the belief fewer police would be in attendance at a match in Dagenham, but who instead, <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> force to prevent trouble. In November 2014 the two sides' development squads were drawn against each other in the U21 Premier League Cup. The Metropolitan Police took preventative measures against any trouble occurring, demanding the game at Rush Green kick-off at 12pm and be played behind closed doors.|$|E
5|$|Patton's opponent, Republican Larry Forgy, {{hurt his}} {{campaign}} by aligning {{himself with the}} Christian right, alienating moderates in both parties, particularly in Louisville. He also openly opposed the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA), passed in 1990 during the administration of Wallace G. Wilkinson. Republican supporters of education reform deserted his campaign and helped form a bi-partisan coalition supporting KERA. Traditional Democratic voting blocs such as organized labor and African-Americans <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> force for Patton. To further undermine Forgy, Patton reminded voters of the budget cuts by Congressional Republicans to programs affecting the elderly. These issues ultimately delivered a Patton victory of 500,787votes to 479,227. It was the closest Kentucky gubernatorial election in 32years, and {{marked the first time}} an eastern Kentuckian had won the governorship since Bert T. Combs in 1959.|$|E
