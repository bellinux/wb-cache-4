5|$|Hershey co-starred with Joe Pesci as {{a nightclub}} owner {{in the film}} drama The Public Eye (1992) and as the estranged wife of homicidal Michael Douglas in the thriller Falling Down (1993). Among the other feature films in which she {{appeared}} during the 1990s was Jane Campion's adaptation of the Henry James novel The Portrait of a Lady (1996). Hershey earned an Oscar nomination and won the Best Supporting Actress award from the National Society of Film Critics {{for her role as}} Madame Serena Merle in <b>that</b> <b>picture.</b> In 1995, Last of the Dogmen, co-starring Tom Berenger, was released through Savoy Pictures. In 1999, Hershey starred in an independent film called Drowning on Dry Land; during production she met co-star Naveen Andrews, with whom she began a romantic relationship that lasted until 2010.|$|E

25|$|Someone {{has played}} a reprehensible joke on a grieving mother.

There was an investigation concerning <b>that</b> <b>picture,</b> made by the Hillsborough County (FL) Sheriff's Office. No charges were filed, and no wrongdoing was established. The lead detective on the case was named Zalva. This allegation should be easy enough to check out.|$|E

25|$|I {{started selling}} out on Dune. Looking back, it's no one's fault but my own. I {{probably}} shouldn't have done <b>that</b> <b>picture,</b> but I saw tons {{and tons of}} possibilities for things I loved, {{and this was the}} structure to do them in. There was so much room to create a world. But I got strong indications from Raffaella and Dino De Laurentiis of what kind of film they expected, and I knew I didn't have final cut.|$|E
25|$|Looking at <b>that</b> <b>picture</b> today {{makes me}} cringe. It {{was done in}} the worst {{possible}} taste. Back then I was too immature to see that. Shame on me—I should have done everything in my power to stop it. The record company came up with the idea, I think. The lyrics incidentally were a take-off on Kiss, whom we had just supported on a tour. I was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised 'cause he's a virgin killer!' trying to do a more or less way-off-the-mark Paul Stanley impersonation. Klaus immediately said 'that's great! You should do something with it.' Then I had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title, which I actually managed to do to some degree. But the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first. Virgin Killer is none other than the demon of our time, the less compassionate side of the societies we live in today—brutally trampling upon {{the heart and soul of}} innocence.|$|E
500|$|Kaufman's wife Rose {{wrote the}} screenplay's first draft. It took her {{several years to}} complete; she found {{adapting}} the entire novel difficult. Some of the characters and stories from the novel were either changed or given retroactive continuity. Despite the differences, Richard Price approved of Kaufman's adaptation, saying, [...] "I love <b>that</b> <b>picture.</b> It's not my book, and I don't care. The spirit is right, and the way Phil Kaufman directed it showed me another {{way of looking at}} my own book." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{album cover}} {{features}} {{a photograph of}} Dylan with Suze Rotolo. It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein {{at the corner of}} Jones Street and West 4th Street in the West Village, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: [...] "He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at <b>that</b> <b>picture,</b> I think I look fat." [...] In her memoir, A Freewheelin' Time, Rotolo analyzed the significance of the cover art: ...|$|E

500|$|In {{early summer}} 1981, while Raiders of the Lost Ark was being promoted, Columbia Pictures met with Speilberg {{to discuss the}} script, after having to develop Night Skies with the {{director}} as the intended sequel to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. However, the head of Columbia Pictures' marketing and research development, Marvin Atonowsky, concluded {{that it had a}} limited commercial potential, believing that it would appeal to mostly young kids. The President of Columbia's worldwide productions, John Veitch, also felt that the script wasn't good or scary enough to draw enough crowd. On the advice of Atonowsky and Veitch, Columbia Pictures CEO Frank Price passed on the project, calling it [...] "a wimpy Walt Disney movie" [...] and thus putting it in a turnaround, so Spielberg approached the more receptive Sid Sheinberg, president of MCA, the then-parent company of Universal Studios. Spielberg told Sheinberg to acquire the E.T. script from Columbia Pictures, which he did for $1 million and struck a deal with Price in which Columbia would retain 5% of the film's net profits. Veitch later recalled that [...] "I think [...] we made more on <b>that</b> <b>picture</b> than we did on any of our films." ...|$|E
500|$|Skipper W was a 1945 sorrel {{stallion}} bred by H. J. Wiescamp of Alamosa, Colorado. Sired by Nick Shoemaker, {{whose father}} was Nick sired by Shiek P-11, Skipper W was out of Hired Girl, a daughter of Cowboy P-12. His second dam, or maternal grandmother, was Leche, who was also fathered by Nick by Shiek P-11. The colt was named Skipper W because, as Wiescamp related:I had another good stud colt born {{around the same time}} as Skipper. He was a palomino sired by Gold Mount and out of Slipalong Wiescamp. That was also the year that the good movie, Showboat, came out and I named the little yellow colt after <b>that</b> <b>picture.</b> Anyway, I had Hired Girl up in a corral and, after she foaled, I told a fellow who was working for me to disinfect the naval on the colt [...] After the man did that, the colt got up and turned around and kicked him 'cause it smarted. I said to that fellow, [...] "Look at that, he already knows he's the boss! I've got a showboat, and every boat needs a skipper, so that's what I'm going to name him– Skipper." [...] I added the W for Wiescamp.|$|E
500|$|Kurosawa's New Hollywood admirers have {{included}} Robert Altman, Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, George Lucas, and John Milius. In {{his early years}} while still a television director, Robert Altman stated that {{when he first saw}} Rashomon he was so impressed by its cinematographer's achievement of shooting several shots with the camera aimed directly at the sun—allegedly it was the first film in which this was done successfully—that he claims he was inspired the very next day to begin incorporating shots of the sun into his television work. It was Coppola who said of Kurosawa, [...] "One thing that distinguishes [...] is that he didn't make one masterpiece or two masterpieces. He made, you know, eight masterpieces." [...] Both Spielberg and Scorsese have praised the older man's role as teacher and role model, and Scorsese called him his [...] "sensei," [...] using the Japanese term. Spielberg has declared, [...] "I have learned more from him than from almost any other filmmaker {{on the face of the}} earth", while Scorsese remarked, [...] "Let me say it simply: Akira Kurosawa was my master, and... the master of so many other filmmakers over the years." [...] Several of these moviemakers were also instrumental in helping Kurosawa obtain financing for his late films: Lucas and Coppola served as co-producers on Kagemusha, while the Spielberg name, lent to the 1990 production, Dreams, helped bring <b>that</b> <b>picture</b> to fruition.|$|E

500|$|The {{rights for}} the English-language film were later {{acquired}} by Hammer Films at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, where Let the Right One In won the [...] "Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature," [...] and Matt Reeves was quickly introduced as the director. John Nordling and Carl Molinder, the Swedish producers of the original film, were both involved as producers for the adaptation. Tomas Alfredson, {{the director of the}} Swedish film, was initially asked to direct the remake, but he turned it down stating that [...] "I am too old to make the same film twice and I have other stories that I want to tell." [...] Hammer Films producer Simon Oakes initially referred to the film with [...] "If you call it a faithful remake, I think that's true to say that's what it is. It's not a reimagining; the same beats , maybe the scares are a little bit more scary." [...] He later said, [...] "I call it his [...] version. I don't call it his remake or his re-imagining of it." [...] The decision to make a new film adaptation has been criticized by Tomas Alfredson. He has stated on numerous occasions that he is not in favor of remaking his film. [...] "If one should remake a film, it's because the original is bad. And I don't think mine is," [...] he said. Producer Donna Gigliotti said, [...] "We're incredibly admiring of the original, but to be honest with you, <b>that</b> <b>picture</b> grossed $2 million. It's not like we're remaking Lawrence of Arabia." [...] Producer Simon Oakes {{made it clear that the}} plot of Let Me In would closely resemble that of the original film, except that it will be made [...] "very accessible to a wider audience." ...|$|E

30|$|First, we {{examined}} empirically {{the moment of}} processing of the pictures, testing the assumption of the CoLiDeS[*]+[*]Pic model <b>that</b> <b>pictures</b> are processed {{in the initial stages}} of navigation through a webpage [16]. In an eye-tracking experiment we registrated the eye fixation durations of participants (mainly technology students) on relevant and irrelevant <b>pictures</b> <b>that</b> were included on the pages of the presented website. The website contained biological information and the pictures were either highly or lowly relevant to the content of a page. We found <b>that</b> <b>pictures</b> were processed mainly in the first 10  % of the total time spent on a web-page during the first visit of participants on that page. These results confirm the assumption of CoLiDeS[*]+[*]Pic <b>that</b> <b>pictures</b> are particularly processed in the initial stages of processing a web-page.|$|R

It reunited Hill with Nick Nolte. The movie was a financial failure. Hill said he [...] "tipped my hat to Sam [...] a couple of times" [...] in the film and [...] "I don't think it was understood how much genre parodying was involved in <b>that</b> <b>picture.</b> It rather mystified a lot of American critics but it has its defenders." ...|$|E
2500|$|François Truffaut's Jules and Jim was an {{influence}} on the story arc between the characters Angela, Gerard and Marcus.
