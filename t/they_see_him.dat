5|$|Homer {{makes an}} {{appointment}} {{at the clinic}} and pays for it by pawning their television. This only frustrates {{the rest of the}} Simpsons as he takes them to the scheduled appointment. In the waiting room, they claim the family doesn't have a problem and are silenced by Homer. Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises. The first is a drawing exercise, which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems. Most of the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> When Dr. Monroe observes it, he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family. This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost in the exercise and having the family view him as such, including being too strict as a disciplinarian. The other methods in getting the family {{to talk to each other}} in a normal matter fail. Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room, allowing them to deliver electric shocks to each other. The family shocks one another to the point of causing a power drain on the city. Unable to help them, Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back. With a fresh sense of family unity, they use the money to buy a new television set.|$|E

5|$|The four spies head to City Hall to warn Mayor West {{about the}} sleeper agent, but they {{discover}} that the mayor is the sleeper agent when Aykroyd inadvertently uses the trigger phrase. During the ensuing fight, Aykroyd plants a homing beacon on Mayor West's leg. West escapes to Russia and the four follow him. They are quickly captured under orders of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who explains that the sleeper agent plan would be an embarrassment to their government if revealed to the public. He offers to help them stop West from fulfilling his pre-programmed mission. When the four find West, <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> launch a nuclear missile aimed at the United States before he snaps out of his trance. Mayor West holds himself responsible for America's fate, though Brian comforts him {{with the knowledge that}} West was not in control of his actions, having been brainwashed by the Soviets. Aykroyd realizes that he can hack into the missile's guidance system. This allows him to aim the missile's warhead high above the Earth's atmosphere and harmlessly explode, saving the US. The fuselage, though, crashes into Cleveland's house in Stoolbend, Virginia, while Cleveland was taking a bath, eliciting confusion from his neighbor, Tim the Bear. The episode ends with Brian and Stewie in the family living room as they recount their adventure and repeat the activation phrase, which reveals Meg to be another sleeper agent.|$|E

500|$|... "Danny Deever" [...] is an 1890 poem by Rudyard Kipling, one of {{the first}} of the Barrack-Room Ballads. It {{received}} wide critical and popular acclaim, and is often regarded as {{one of the}} most significant pieces of Kipling's early verse. The poem, a ballad, describes the execution of a British soldier in India for murder. His execution is viewed by his regiment, paraded to watch it, and the poem is composed of the comments they exchange as <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> hanged.|$|E
500|$|Grant {{has been}} more direct in his {{description}} of Anarky's virtuous attributes: [...] "In my eyes, Anarky's a hero. Anarky's the hero I want to be if I was smart enough and physically fit enough." [...] Acknowledging that Anarky's moral perspective was guided by his own, Grant expressed that the conflict between Anarky and other heroes {{is a result of}} their political divisions: [...] "In my eyes, he's a hero, but to others, <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> as a villain. That is because most people might gripe about the political situation, or various aspects of the political situation, and wouldn't advocate the total overthrow of the system under which we live. Anarky certainly does that, and more." ...|$|E

Awaking in the Temple of Ormagöden, Eddie meets with Ophelia while fighting Doviculus' forces, developing a crush on her. They discover writings left by the Titans that Eddie is able to comprehend, and build a hot-rod, the [...] "Deuce", that they use to escape the Temple and travel to Bladehenge, the base for the small human resistance force led by Lars and Lita. When they meet Eddie and learn he can understand the Titans' messages, <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> as a prophetical [...] "Chosen One", though unsure if he will be the savior or destroyer of the world.

The Pac-10 schools wanted him to walk-on, rather than be actively recruited or offered a sports scholarship. Harvard and Brown were the only teams that guaranteed him a spot on their basketball teams, but Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships. Rex Walters, University of San Francisco men's basketball coach and retired NBA player, said NCAA limits on coaches' recruiting visits had reduced Lin's chances. [...] "Most colleges start recruiting a guy in the first five minutes <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> because he runs really fast, jumps really high, does the quick, easy thing to evaluate," [...] Walters said. Lin added, [...] "I just think in order for someone to understand my game, they have to watch me more than once, because I'm {{not going to do anything}} that's extra flashy or freakishly athletic." ...|$|E

The Council orders them to send an agent to ask General Thaddeus [...] "Thunderbolt" [...] Ross to release Blonsky into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. As Nick Fury {{does not want to}} release Blonsky, the two agents decide to send a patsy to sabotage the meeting. At Sitwell's urging, Coulson reluctantly sends [...] "The Consultant": Tony Stark. As partially depicted in the post-credits scene of The Incredible Hulk, a disgraced Ross sits drinking in a bar, when he is approached by Stark, who annoys Ross so much that he tries to have Stark removed from the bar. In reply, Stark buys the bar and has it scheduled for demolition. The next day, Coulson informs Sitwell that their plan worked, and that Blonsky will remain in prison.|$|E
500|$|Obsle, Yegey, and Shusgis are Commensals, {{three of}} the thirty-three councilmen that rule Orgoreyn. Obsle and Yegey {{are members of the}} [...] "Open Trade" [...] faction, who wish to {{normalize}} relations with Karhide. Obsle is the commensal of the Sekeve District, and was once the head of the Orgota Naval Trade Commission in Erhenrang, where he became acquainted with Estraven. Estraven describes him as the nearest thing to an honest person among the politicians of Orgoreyn. Yegey is the commensal who first finds Estraven during his exile, and who gives Estraven a job and a place to live in Mishnory. Shusgis is the commensal who hosts Genly Ai after Ai's arrival in Mishnory, {{and is a member of}} the opposing faction, which supports the Sarf, the Orgota secret police. Although Obsle and Yegey support Ai's mission, <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> more as a means of increasing their own influence within the council; thus they eventually betray him to the Sarf, in order to save themselves. Their Open Trade faction takes control of the council after Ai's presence in Karhide becomes known at the end of the novel.|$|E
