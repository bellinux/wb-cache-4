5|$|Jupiter's regular {{satellites}} {{are believed}} to have formed from a circumplanetary disk, a ring of accreting gas and solid debris analogous to a protoplanetary disk. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> remnants of a score of Galilean-mass satellites that formed early in Jupiter's history.|$|E
5|$|The river martins are in {{some ways}} {{intermediate}} between typical swallows and other passerines: they have stout bills, large feet and relatively strong legs, which is unusual in aerial feeders. They also have a large syrinx (vocal organ) and a different bronchial structure. The extent of their differences from other swallows and the wide geographical separation of these two martins suggest that they are relict populations {{of a group of}} species that diverged from the main swallow lineage early in its evolutionary history, and <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most primitive of the swallows. Like other early hirundine lineages, they nest in burrows, rather than adopted nest holes or mud nests.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of most frogs {{are located}} {{on either side of}} the head near the top and project {{outwards}} as hemispherical bulges. They provide binocular vision over a field of 100° to the front and a total visual field of almost 360°. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water. Each eye has closable upper and lower lids and a nictitating membrane which provides further protection, especially when the frog is swimming. Members of the aquatic family Pipidae have the eyes located at the top of the head, a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above. The irises come in a range of colours and the pupils in a range of shapes. The common toad (Bufo bufo) has golden irises and horizontal slit-like pupils, the red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) has vertical slit pupils, the poison dart frog has dark irises, the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.) has triangular pupils and the tomato frog (Dyscophus spp.) has circular ones. The irises of the southern toad (Anaxyrus terrestris) are patterned so as to blend in with the surrounding camouflaged skin.|$|E

25|$|Electroporation uses {{high voltage}} {{electrical}} pulses to translocate DNA across the cell membrane (and cell wall, if present). In contrast, transduction involves the packaging of DNA into virus-derived particles, and using these virus-like particles {{to introduce the}} encapsulated DNA into the cell through a process resembling viral infection. Although electroporation and transduction are highly specialized methods, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most efficient methods to move DNA into cells.|$|E

25|$|With the {{exception}} of Argentinosaurus (included {{to fill a gap}} in time), these graphs show only the length of sauropods for whom near-complete fossil skeletons are known. It doesn't show other very large sauropods (see Dinosaur size#Sauropods) because these are only known from very incomplete skeletons. The ratio of skull length to body length is much higher in Eoraptor than in sauropods. The longest skull graphed is of Nemegtosaurus, which is not thought be a particularly large sauropod. The skull of Nemegtosaurus was found near the headless skeleton of 11 metre (36 ft) long Opisthocoelicaudia, and {{it has been suggested that}} <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same species, but see Nemegtosauridae.|$|E
25|$|Radio galaxies. These objects show {{nuclear and}} {{extended}} radio emission. Their other AGN properties are heterogeneous. They can broadly {{be divided into}} low-excitation and high-excitation classes. Low-excitation objects show no strong narrow or broad emission lines, and the emission lines they do have may be excited by a different mechanism. Their optical and X-ray nuclear emission is consistent with originating purely in a jet. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best current candidates for AGN with radiatively inefficient accretion. By contrast, high-excitation objects (narrow-line radio galaxies) have emission-line spectra {{similar to those of}} Seyfert 2s. The small class of broad-line radio galaxies, which show relatively strong nuclear optical continuum emission probably includes some objects that are simply low-luminosity radio-loud quasars. The host galaxies of radio galaxies, whatever their emission-line type, are essentially always ellipticals.|$|E
25|$|This first plotline is {{interspersed}} with scenes of Richard and Susan, who came on vacation to Morocco {{to get away}} from and mend their own woes. The death of their infant third child, to SIDS, has strained their marriage significantly and they struggle to communicate their frustration, guilt, and blame. When Susan is shot on the tour bus, Richard orders the bus driver to the nearest village, Tazarine. There, a local veterinarian sews up Susan's wound to stem the loss of blood. Richard contacts the US embassy to request an ambulance. The other tourists wait for some time, but they eventually demand to leave, fearing the heat and that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> target of further attacks. Richard tells the tour group to wait for the ambulance, which never arrives, and eventually the bus leaves without them. The couple stays behind with the bus's tour guide, Anwar, still waiting for transport to a hospital. Political issues between the US and Morocco prevent quick help, but eventually a helicopter arrives and carries Richard and Susan to a hospital in Casablanca, where she is expected to recover. Richard calls his children's nanny, Amelia, from the hospital, and they agree not to tell the children that Susan has been shot yet. Richard cries as his son tells him about his day at school.|$|E

500|$|In 1964, Canadian mycologist Kenneth A. Harrison {{described}} a hydnoid fungus found with Pinus resinosa in Michigan and Pinus banksiana in Nova Scotia. The fungus, which Harrison named Hydnellum pineticola, {{is considered to}} be synonymous with Hydnellum ferrugineum by the nomenclatural database Index Fungorum. Harrison noted [...] "The attempts to recognize European species in North American collections has only increased the confusion in this country, and until someone has worked critically in the field on both continents, it is better to make a recognizable grouping of our own population as that to guess that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same as those that grow in Europe." [...] Other taxa considered synonymous with H.ferrugineum are Pierre Bulliard's 1791 Hydnum hybridum (including later synonyms Calodon hybridus (Bull.) Lindau, and Hydnellum hybridum (Bull.) Banker); Louis Secretan's Hydnum carbunculus (1833); and Howard James Banker's 1906 Hydnellum sanguinarium. Banker explained the difficulty in identifying old Hydnellum specimens: [...] "A considerable number of collections have had to be set aside, as in the dried state, with no notes on the fresh characters, it was impossible to decide with any degree of satisfaction whether the plants represented H.sanguinarium, H.concrescens, H.scrobiculatum, or some undescribed form." ...|$|E
