5|$|In the 1st century AD {{the complex}} {{underwent}} a major expansion.

5|$|In 1926, after {{pressure}} from the returned soldiers, a second competition was announced. Once again the budget was set at £25,000. As per the first competition, all entrants had to be South Australian British subjects, and all entries were to be judged anonymously, but <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> to be only one assessor: John Smith Murdoch, the chief architect for the Commonwealth of Australia. In deference to the previous competition, the top five entrants from 1924 were each given £75 upon the submission of a new design, {{and all of the}} designs were insured by the government for £100 each.|$|E

5|$|Plymouth Argyle Football Club is an English {{association}} {{football club}} based in Plymouth, Devon. They compete in Football League One, the third tier of the English football league system, {{as of the}} 2017–18 season. The club was founded in 1886 as Argyle Football Club. At <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no League football, so matches were arranged on an ad hoc basis, supplemented by cup competitions. In January 1903, the club became a limited company and changed their name to Plymouth Argyle F.C. Election to the Southern League followed in March, as the club gained direct entry to the First Division for the 1903–04 season. The club were also invited {{to compete in the}} Western League, a competition which was considered secondary to the Southern League.|$|E
5|$|There are six {{reference}} {{routes in}} Essex County; a seventh, NY910L, was redesignated NY185 on April4, 2008, {{as part of}} a New York State Department of Transportation project to rehabilitate the Champlain Bridge.

The longest reference route is NY910M at , running from John Brown's Grave to NY73. The other three reference routes are NY910K (part of the Blue Ridge Road), NY912T (the shortest reference route, at , and a connector to NY373), and NY913Q, which serves Mount Van Hoevenberg in North Elba.|$|E
5|$|According to {{government}} surveyor Thomas Corby, Newton's parakeet {{may still have}} been fairly common in 1843. Slater reported that he saw a single specimen in southwestern Rodrigues during his three-month stay to observe the 1874 Transit of Venus, and assistant colonial secretary William J. Caldwell saw several specimens in 1875 during his own three-month visit. The male that he received in 1875 and gave to Newton is the last recorded member of the species. A series of cyclones struck the following year and may have devastated the remaining population. Further severe storms hit in 1878 and 1886, and since few forested areas were left by <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little cover to protect any remaining birds. The male could, therefore, {{have been the last}} of the species alive.|$|E

5|$|Another tradition, {{related by}} R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events {{which took place}} after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born. The story related how at <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle, and since the infant's nursemaid was anxious {{to join in the}} festivities in the hall below, she left the infant alone in her room. When the baby awoke, crying of cold, no human help could hear him in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies {{appeared}} and wrapped the infant in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, wrapped in the flag, everyone gazed in wonder at the child and the garb wrapped around him. The room was filled with the fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence fell across the crowded room, the flag was taken from the infant and locked in a chest where it has ever since been preserved.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period that Marquis became {{interested}} in the Battle of the Little Bighorn and the death of Custer. This interest became an obsession that was to last the rest of his life. The battle site was only twenty-five miles to the west on the Crow Indian Reservation. All the participants of the battle on the US side had died in action, but very little had been published in the way of Indian accounts. Most information had come from soldiers who only witnessed the aftermath. Marquis realized that {{there were a number of}} Cheyenne participants of the battle still alive on the reservation. However, interviewing them at length seemed too difficult at <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> <b>There</b> <b>was</b> the language barrier, and Marquis was busy as a doctor trying to cover a large area.|$|E
5|$|Katrina {{continued}} to track over Central America {{for most of}} October30 and began to accelerate. Roughly 24hours after landfall, the depression moved back over water, in the Gulf of Honduras; however, by <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no convection remaining around the system. The acceleration of the storm was due to a regeneration of the low-level circulation northward. Due to unfavorable conditions, the weakened system failed to regenerate convection before moving back over land near the northern Belize-Mexico border. Around this time, forecasters reported that the depression would re-intensify once in the Gulf of Mexico before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Although situated over land, the depression began to regenerate convection, leading to increased rainfall over the Yucatan Peninsula. By the evening of November1, the depression weakened again and moved into the Gulf of Mexico; however, unlike previous forecasts, the circulation was absorbed by a cold front hours later.|$|E

5|$|The Rhine Campaign of 1796 saw Moreau's army {{facing the}} Austrian Army of the Upper Rhine under Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour in the south. Meanwhile, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's French Army of Sambre-et-Meuse opposed the Army of the Lower Rhine under Archduke Charles in the north. Jourdan drubbed Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg at Altenkirchen on 4 June, {{compelling}} Archduke Charles {{to rush to}} the rescue with reinforcements. Charles defeated Jourdan at Wetzlar on the 15th, forcing him to pull back {{to the west bank}} of the Rhine. At <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a shake up in the high command and the archduke was put in control of both Austrian armies. In Charles' absence, Moreau successfully crossed the Rhine at Kehl on the night of 23–24 June and beat Latour at Rastatt on 5 July. Leaving Wilhelm von Wartensleben in charge in the north, Charles rushed south to confront Moreau along the Alb River near Ettlingen. After an all-day combat, the Austrians held the advantage on their right wing near Malsch, but the French had defeated their left wing in the Black Forest.|$|E
