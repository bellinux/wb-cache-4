25|$|Colombia–United States {{relations}} are the bilateral {{relations between the}} Republic of Colombia and the United States of America. The {{relationship between the two}} states evolved from mutual cordiality during most of the 19th and early 20th centuries to a recent partnership that links the governments of both nations around several key issues; this includes fighting communism, the War on Drugs, and <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>terrorism</b> due to the September 11 attacks in 2001. During the last fifty years, different American governments and their representatives have become involved in Colombian affairs through the implementation of policies concerned with the issues already stated. Some critics of current US policies in Colombia, such as Law Professor John Barry, claim that US influences have catalyzed internal conflicts and substantially expanded the scope and nature of human rights abuses in Colombia. Supporters, such as Under Secretary of State Marc Grossman, defend the idea that the United States has promoted respect for human rights {{and the rule of law}} in Colombia; in addition, adding to the fight against drugs and terrorism.|$|E

The invasion of Iraq was strongly opposed by some long-standing U.S. allies, including the governments of France, Germany, and New Zealand.

For example, while Mrs Chew is giving birth, Lee Kuan Yew's voice can be heard on a radio in the background, announcing Singapore's separation from Malaysia. Other events in the film parallel those in Singapore's history, such as the riot at the rubbish dump alluding to the labour strikes and riots of the 1960s, as well as <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>terrorism</b> in the new millennium. One of Kiat Kun's friends is nicknamed [...] "Little Red Dot", a phrase used by former Indonesian president Jusuf Habibie to disparage Singapore. The final scene in the film shows the Chew siblings standing before a long muddy path, which symbolises the uncertainly faced by both the newly independent nation in 1965 and the country in transition in 2003.|$|E
500|$|As with Dune II, Command & Conquer {{originally}} {{took place}} in a high fantasy world before being redesigned.

Westwood co-founder Louis Castle said that [...] "ar was in the news and <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>terrorism</b> was on everyone's mind". The setting was further influenced by Sperry's belief that future wars would not be [...] "nation-to-nation", but would rather be [...] "fought between Western society and a kind of anarchistic terror organization that doesn't have a centralized government." [...] The team sought to make the player feel like their computer was [...] "a terminal to a real battlefield", {{going so far as to}} make the installation process resemble hacking a [...] "military infrastructure".

500|$|After the American {{invasion}} of Afghanistan fails to uproot the alleged terrorist organisation, the Bush administration focuses inwards, searching unsuccessfully for terrorist sleeper cells in America. In 2003, they extend the War on Terror {{to a war}} on general perceived evils with the {{invasion of}} Iraq. The ideas and tactics also spread to the United Kingdom, where Tony Blair uses <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>terrorism</b> {{to give him a}} new moral authority. The repercussions of the neoconservative strategy are also explored, with an investigation of indefinitely-detained terrorist suspects in Guantanamo Bay, many allegedly taken on the word of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance without actual investigation {{on the part of the}} United States military, and other forms of [...] "preemption" [...] against non-existent and unlikely threats made simply on the grounds that the parties involved had the potential to become a threat. Curtis specifically attempts to allay fears of a dirty bomb attack, and concludes by reassuring viewers that politicians will eventually have to concede that some threats are exaggerated and others have no foundation in reality. He says, [...] "In an age when all the grand ideas have lost credibility, fear of a phantom enemy is all the politicians have left to maintain their power." ...|$|E
500|$|Among {{conservative}} and neoconservative {{critics in the}} United States, The Power of Nightmares {{has been described as}} [...] "conspiracy theory", anti-American or both. David Asman of FoxNews.com said, [...] "We wish we didn't have to keep presenting examples of how the European media have become obsessively anti-American. But they keep pushing the barrier, now to the point of absurdity." [...] His views were shared by commentator Clive Davis, ending his commentary on the film for National Review by saying, [...] "British producers, hooked on Chomskyite visions of 'Amerika' as the fount of all evil, are clearly not interested in even beginning to dig for the truth." [...] Other commentators have variously described the film as pushing a conspiracy theory. Davis and British commentator David Aaronovitch both explicitly labelled the film's message as a conspiracy theory, with the latter saying of Curtis [...] "his argument is as subtle as a house-brick." [...] Attacks in this vein continued after the 7 July 2005 London bombings, with the Christian Broadcasting Network referencing the film as a source for claims by the [...] "British left" [...] that [...] "the U.S. War on Terror was a fraud", and the Australia Israel & Jewish Affairs Council calling it [...] "the loopiest, most extreme anti-war documentary series ever sponsored by the BBC." [...] In The Shadows in the Cave, Curtis emphasises that he does not discount the possibility of any terrorist activity taking place, but that <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>terrorism</b> had been greatly exaggerated. He responded to accusations of creating a conspiracy theory by saying he believes the alleged use of fear as a force in politics is not the result of a conspiracy but rather the subjects of the film [...] "have stumbled on it." ...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis seeks to explain if President Barack Obama's {{efforts to reduce}} nuclear terrorism have had a meaningful impact. Key areas of observation include how well efforts have been implemented and how effectively the president has fostered domestic and international support. Early in his presidency, President Obama declared {{to the world that}} the United States would lead a concerted effort to reduce <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>terrorism.</b> Combined with the Nuclear Security Summits, the president's efforts quickly established reducing <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>terrorism</b> as a top priority for his administration. Over the ensuing eight years, President Obama diligently supported nonproliferation measures by enhancing the domestic and international nonproliferation architecture. The president's integrative approach wove nonproliferation efforts together that had, traditionally, not been used to reduce <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>terrorism.</b> <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> this thesis indicate that most of the programs were successful but problems remain, particularly in areas linked to further arms reductions and international nonproliferation.
