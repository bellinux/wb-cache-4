40|$|High S/N ratio spectra {{have been}} {{obtained}} at CFHT at a spectral resolution of 100 000 for HD 84397 and two other metal poor stars. For HD 84 937, the S/N of 650 per pixel was obtained, yielding Li- 6 /Li- 7 = 0. 052 with a sigma of 0. 019. The Li- 6 abundance is compared with recent models of formation of light elements LiBeB. This comparison shows that Li- 6 is either undepleted or only moderatly depleted in the star of interest. The depletion of Li- 7 in this star {{is estimated to be}} less than 0. 1 dex. The abundance of lithium on the Spite plateau accordingly can be <b>takien</b> as representative of the cosmological primordial lithium. See the joint paper Astro-ph / 9811327...|$|E
