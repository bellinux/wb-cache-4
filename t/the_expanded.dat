On {{the basis of}} belled steel pile, {{a new form of}} steel piles, explosive expansion steel piles, is proposed. Based on ABAQUS, the two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element contact model of pile and soil is set up. The parameters include: the diameter of <b>the</b> <b>expanding</b> section and highness of <b>the</b> <b>expanding</b> section have been analyzed through the Q-S curve. The results show that: the vertical bearing capacity increases significantly with the increase of the diameter of <b>the</b> <b>expanding</b> section, but decreases with the increase of the highness of <b>the</b> <b>expanding</b> sectio...|$|R
