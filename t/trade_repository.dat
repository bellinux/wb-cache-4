40|$|After the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, {{the financial}} innovation product Credit-Default-Swap (CDS) was widely blamed {{as the main}} cause of this crisis. CDS is one type of over-the-counter (OTC) traded derivatives. Before the crisis, the trading of CDS was very popular among the financial institutions. But meanwhile, excessive speculative CDSs transactions in a legal environment of scant regulation accumulated huge risks in the financial system. This dissertation is divided into three parts. In Part I, we discussed the primers of the CDSs and its market development, then we analyzed in detail the roles CDSs had played in this crisis based on economic studies. It is advanced that CDSs not just promoted the eruption of the crisis in 2007 but also exacerbated it in 2008. In part II, we asked ourselves what are the legal origins of this crisis in relation with CDSs, as we believe that financial instruments could only function, positive or negative, under certain legal institutional environment. After an in-depth inquiry, we observed that at least three traditional legal doctrines were eroded or circumvented by OTC derivatives. It is argued that the malfunction of these doctrines, on the one hand, facilitated the proliferation of speculative CDSs transactions; on the other hand, eroded the original risk-control legal mechanism. Therefore, the 2008 crisis could escalate rapidly into a global financial tsunami, which was out of control of the regulators. In Part III, we focused on the European Union’s regulatory reform towards the OTC derivatives market. In specific, EU introduced mandatory central counterparty clearing obligation for qualified OTC derivatives, and requires that all OTC derivatives shall be reported to a <b>trade</b> <b>repository.</b> It is observable that EU’s approach in re-regulating the derivatives market is different with the traditional administrative regulation, but aiming at constructing a new market infrastructure for OTC derivatives...|$|E

The regulation also ensures that information on all European derivative transactions will be reported to <b>trade</b> <b>repositories</b> and be accessible to supervisory authorities, including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), to give policy makers and supervisors a clear overview {{of what is going}} on in the markets.

50|$|The European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) {{is a body}} of {{legislation}} for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, central counterparties and <b>trade</b> <b>repositories.</b> EMIR was introduced by the European Union (EU) as implementation of the G20 commitment to reduce systemic, counterparty and operational risk, and increase transparency in the OTC derivatives market.

50|$|In September 2013, new {{obligations}} embedded into EMIR took effect, requiring EU {{banks and}} their counterparties {{to discuss and}} agree on processes and procedures for portfolio reconciliation and dispute resolution of derivatives executed in the OTC market.

40|$|After {{more than}} a decade of indecision, the EU is finally now set to {{implement}} a consistent regulatory architecture for clearing and settlement. Following the agreement on a European market infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), the European Commission has proposed harmonised rules for centralised settlement depositaries (CSDs), while the European Central Bank is moving forward with its plans for a central eurozone settlement engine. This paper analyses three components of the new post-trade infrastructure measures: 1) the regulatory framework for and supervision of central counterparties under the new EMIR legislation, 2) the authorisation requirements of <b>trade</b> <b>repositories</b> and 3) the draft CSD Regulation and the progress with the ECB’s Target 2 Securities project.

Then, we describe the main tools under consideration, relating to the use of sound market infrastructures – central counterparties and <b>trade</b> <b>repositories</b> –, enhanced bilateral risk management as well as to cooperation between regulators and overseers of infrastructures and banking supervisors.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{relationships}} among financial market sub-segments {{as a way to}} identify potential financial distress through increased co-movements among them. To study how sub-markets are mutually co-dependent, we combine granular data on over-the-counter derivatives by <b>trade</b> <b>repositories</b> and the joint probability of distress (JPoD) approach introduced by the International Monetary Fund. We define an indicator that combines several distress drivers and observe that results on co-dependencies are similar to those that would be expected: similarities between financial and contractual terms seem to be responsible for stronger co-movements among sub-markets. However, high values for JPoD even in correspondence of quite dissimilar sub-markets suggest the presence of other drivers that should be investigated in future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study on systemic risk assessment based on micro-founded trade repositories’ data on interest rate swaps...|$|R
40|$|Derivatives {{transactions}} {{are an important}} part of the financial markets. For this reason, the market infrastructures supporting the trading, clearing and settling of derivatives transactions, in particular <b>trade</b> <b>repositories</b> and central counterparties, play an important role in contributing to the transparency, the safety and the efficiency of derivatives markets. This, in turn, enhances the stability of the financial system. This article, after a brief look at derivatives transactions and the market structure of the derivatives markets, will first discuss the risks in clearing and settling derivatives transactions, then look at the market infrastructure supporting derivatives markets, mention the new international standards for financial market infrastructure and discuss the role of oversight. It will then focus on the collection of data on derivatives markets, including the derivatives statistics published by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). 2.

40|$|After {{the recent}} {{financial}} crisis, it is undoubtedly {{recognized the importance}} of assessing not only the risk of distress for a single entity", but also the distress dependencies between the different ", where by " we mean in a broad sense any relevant cluster of products, risk factors, counterparties.

We define a distress indicator by combining some distress drivers, such as averaged volumes, liquidity, volatility and bid-ask proxies. Hence, we analyse the distress dependencies among sub-markets identified by the segmentation of the IRS market according to contractual and financial features. We try to combine in an innovative way some new ingredients, namely the more granular data on OTC derivatives available from the <b>trade</b> <b>repositories</b> along with the classical JPoD approach introduced in the recent years by the IMF for studying the distress interdependence structure among financial institutions.

40|$|The European Union {{reacted to}} the (several) crisis – financial, of the public debt, economic, {{and in some ways}} existential – with a {{centralization}} of many relevant functions (the budget area and banking supervision are two such examples). Compared to this trend, the first reform, dating back to 2011 – the establishment of the European System of Financial Supervision and of the European Supervisory Authorities – is a ‘weak model’ of enhanced cooperation. However, European financial regulation does not follow one single model of division of competences between the European authorities and national ones: in the area of credit rating agencies (CRAs) and for some aspects of derivatives (such as <b>trade</b> <b>repositories</b> (TRs)), supervisory competences have been given to the Esma. Hence, a remarkable centralization has taken place. Is this delegation of powers legitimate? The paper examines the current normative framework and the first years of activity of the Esma, in particular through the analysis of its practices in the area of CRAs. The paper concludes that recent decisions of the ESMA do not follow the criteria set forth by the Court of Justice in the short selling case in order for delegation of powers to technical authorities to be legitimate and calls for a broader implementation of procedural rights and duty to give reasons by the most powerful EU financial authority...|$|R
