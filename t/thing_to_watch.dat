2500|$|New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, {{all major}} US cities, {{attracted}} {{a large number}} of tourists by the 1890s. New York's population grew from 300,000 in 1840 to 800,000 in 1850. Chicago experienced a dramatic increase from 4,000 residents in 1840 to 300,000 by 1870. Dictionaries first published the word 'tourist' sometime in 1800, when it referred to those going to Europe or making a round trip of natural wonders in New York and New England. The absence of urban tourism during the nineteenth century was in part because American cities lacked the architecture and art which attracted thousands to Europe. American cities tended to offend the sensitive with ugliness and commercialism rather than inspire awe or aesthetic pleasure. Some tourists were fascinated by the rapid growth of the new urban areas: [...] "It is an absorbing <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the process of world-making; both the formation of the natural and the conventional world," [...] wrote English writer Harriet Martineau in 1837.|$|E

[...] "He loved the game, and he loved to win, but he occasionally made a very bad stroke, and then the varied, picturesque, and unorthodox vocabulary, acquired in his more youthful years, {{was the only thing}} that gave him comfort. Gently, slowly, with no profane inflexions of voice, but irresistibly as though they had the headwaters of the Mississippi for their source, came this stream of unholy adjectives and choice expletives." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{a strange}} <b>thing,</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> these {{conspicuous}} forms toiling up the hillside, dodging {{this way and that}} way, as the bullets cut into the earth around them; but with the experience of the previous ten minutes fresh in the memory, pity was not one of the emotions it aroused. A good many fell, subsiding peacefully, and lying quite still. Their fall was greeted by strange little yells of pleasure from the native soldiers. These Afridi and Pathan companies of the Guides Infantry suggest {{nothing so much as a}} well-trained pack of hounds. Their cries, their movements, and their natures are similar.|$|E

5000|$|The {{film was}} heavily panned by critics, and has {{retrospectively}} scored an approval rating of 25% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 12 reviews, {{with an average}} of 3.9/10. On their television show At the Movies, critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert featured the film in their round-up of the year's worst films, pointing out the less-than-special effects such as the visible harness and cable used to suspend Condorman in the air and the obvious bluescreen effect. On the other hand, John Corry of The New York Times wrote a favorable review of the film, calling it [...] "painless and chaste, and {{it has a lot of}} beautiful scenery and beautiful clothes.

One man as I was about to pass him {{at the top of}} Bedford Street, turned upon me abruptly and came into me, sending me into the road and almost under the wheel of a passing hansom. The verdict of the cab-rank was that he had had some sort of stroke. I was so unnerved by this encounter that I went into Covent Garden Market and sat down for some time in a quiet corner by a stall of violets, panting and trembling. I found I had caught a fresh cold, and had to turn out after a time lest my sneezes should attract attention.|$|E
6000|$|You see my kind {{of loyalty}} was loyalty to one's country, not to its {{institutions}} or its office-holders. The country is the real thing, the substantial thing, the eternal thing; it is the <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> over, and care for, and be loyal to; institutions are extraneous, they are its mere clothing, and clothing can wear out, become ragged, cease to be comfortable, cease to protect the body from winter, disease, and death. To be loyal to rags, to shout for rags, to worship rags, to die for rags--that is a loyalty of unreason, it is pure animal; it belongs to monarchy, was invented by monarchy; let monarchy keep it. I was from Connecticut, whose Constitution declares [...] "that all political power {{is inherent in the}} people, and all free governments are founded on their authority and instituted for their benefit; and that they have at all times an undeniable and indefeasible right to alter their form of government in such a manner as they may think expedient." ...|$|E

60|$|To conclude: These {{considerations}} may {{perhaps have}} some effect while men are awake; but what arguments shall {{we use to}} the sleeper? What methods shall we take to hold open his eyes? Will he be moved by considerations of common civility? We know it is reckoned a point of very bad manners to sleep in private company, when, perhaps, the tedious impertinence of many talkers would render it at least as excusable as the dullest sermon. Do they think it a small <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> four hours at a play, where all virtue and religion are openly reviled; and can they not watch one half hour to hear them defended? Is this to deal like a judge (I mean like a good judge), to listen {{on one side of}} the cause and sleep on the other? I shall add but one word more. That this indecent sloth is very much owing to that luxury and excess men usually practise upon this day, by which half the service thereof is turned to sin; men dividing their time between God and their bellies, when, after a gluttonous meal, their senses dozed and stupefied, they retire to God's house to sleep out the afternoon. Surely, brethren, these things ought not so to be.|$|E
60|$|We {{climbed on}} {{to the top of}} the kopje, which was {{sprinkled}} with staff officers and others--all much interested in the exhibition of shell fire, which they discussed as a purely scientific question. Inniskilling Hill was still crowned with the enemy, though they no longer showed above their trenches. Its slopes were scored with numerous brown lines, the stone walls built by the attacking brigade during the night, and behind these the telescope showed the Infantry clustering thickly. The Boers on their part had made some new trenches in advance of those on the crest of the hill, so that the opposing firing lines were scarcely three hundred yards apart, which meant that everyone in them must lie still or run grave risks. Thus they remained all day, firing at each other continually, while on the bare ground between them the dead and wounded lay thickly scattered, the dead mixed with the living, the wounded untended, without dressings, food, or water, and harassed by the fire from both sides and from our artillery. It was a very painful <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> these poor fellows moving about feebly and trying to wriggle themselves into some position of safety, and it reminded me of the wounded Dervishes after Omdurman--only these were our own countrymen.|$|E
6000|$|November 8th, 9th.--What splendid weather we are having! Beyond {{one little}} blow, {{we have had}} nothing but fresh breezes the whole voyage. These two days we have made better runs than any hitherto. It is a pretty <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the spray fly up from our prow as it cuts through the waves. The sun shines through it and breaks it up {{into a number of}} {{miniature}} rainbows--"sun-dogs," [...] the sailors call them. I stood on the fo'c'sle-head for several hours to-day watching the effect, and surrounded by a halo of prismatic colours. The steersman has evidently told the other blacks about my wonderful stone, for I am treated by them all with the greatest respect. Talking about optical phenomena, we had a curious one yesterday evening which was pointed out to me by Hyson. This was the appearance of a triangular well-defined object high up in the heavens to the north of us. He explained that it was exactly like the Peak of Teneriffe as seen from a great distance--the peak was, however, at that moment at least five hundred miles to the south. It may have been a cloud, or it may have been one of those strange reflections of which one reads. The weather is very warm. The mate says that he never knew it so warm in these latitudes. Played chess with Harton in the evening.|$|E
40|$|I {{have three}} goals in this article: (1) To show the {{enormous}} potential of bootstrapping and permutation tests {{to help students}} understand statistical concepts including sampling distributions, standard errors, bias, confidence intervals, null distributions, and P-values. (2) To dig deeper, understand why these methods work and when they don’t, <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> out for, and {{how to deal with}} these issues when teaching. (3) To change statistical practice—by comparing these methods to common t tests and intervals, we see how inaccurate the latter are; we confirm this with asymptotics. n ≥ 30 isn’t enough—think n ≥ 5000. Resampling provides diagnostics, and more accurate alternatives. Sadly, the common bootstrap percentile interval badly under-covers in small samples; there are better alternatives. The tone is informal, with a few stories and jokes...|$|R

60|$|Hukweem's {{fishing is}} always an {{interesting}} <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch.</b> Unfortunately he is so shy that one seldom gets a good opportunity. Once I found his favorite fishing ground, and came every day to watch him from a thicket on the shore. It was of little use {{to go in a}} canoe. At my approach he would sink deeper and deeper in the water, as if taking in ballast. How he does this is a mystery; for his body is much lighter than its bulk of water. Dead or alive, it floats like a cork; yet without any perceptible motion, by an effort of will apparently, he sinks it out of sight. You are approaching in your canoe, and he moves off slowly, swinging his {{head from side to side}} so as to look at you first with one eye, then with the other. Your canoe is swift; he sees that you are gaining, that you are already too near. He swings on the water, and sits watching you steadily. Suddenly he begins to sink, deeper and deeper, till his back is just awash. Go a little nearer, and now his body disappears; only his neck and head remain above water. Raise your hand, or make any quick motion, and he is gone altogether. He dives like a flash, swims deep and far, and when he comes to the surface will be well out of danger.|$|E

The gladness of life was upon them, with none of its pains or anxieties or fears, as we know them; and they rolled and tumbled about in the first deep snow with the abandon of young foxes, filled with wonder at the strange blanket that covered the rough places of earth so softly and made their light footsteps more noiseless than before.
