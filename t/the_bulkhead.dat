5|$|At {{the second}} board, expert {{witnesses}} suggested {{that what was}} observed was the venting, through the engine-room ventilators, of a violent—but not instantaneous—explosion or deflagration in the 4-inch magazines. The same deflagration would have collapsed <b>the</b> <b>bulkhead</b> separating the 4-inch and 15-inch magazines, resulting very quickly in a catastrophic explosion similar to those previously witnessed at Jutland. This theory was ultimately adopted by the board.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 2012, the slurry wall for the station site was being taken down. On June 25, 2012, a $324.6 million contract was awarded to E.E. Cruz and Company and Tully Construction Company for the station's plumbing, electricity, ancillaries, and entrances. In March 2013, <b>the</b> <b>bulkhead</b> separating the new construction from the 1970s-era tunnel at 99th Street was completed.|$|E
5|$|On August 12, 1985, Japan Airlines Flight 123, a Boeing 747-146SR, {{suffered}} a rupture {{of the pressure}} bulkhead in its tail section, caused by undetected damage during a faulty repair to the rear bulkhead after a tailstrike seven years earlier. Pressurized air subsequently rushed out of <b>the</b> <b>bulkhead</b> and blew off the plane's vertical stabilizer, also severing all four of its hydraulic control systems. The pilots were {{able to keep the}} plane airborne for 32 minutes using differential engine power, but without any hydraulics or the stabilizing force of the vertical stabilizer, the plane eventually crashed in mountainous terrain. There were only 4 survivors among the 524 on board. This accident is the deadliest single-aircraft accident in history.|$|E
50|$|Following the Titanic disaster, {{ships were}} {{refitted}} for increased safety. For example, the double bottoms of many existing ships, including the RMS Olympic, were extended {{up the sides}} of their hulls, their waterlines, to give them double hulls. Another refit that many ships underwent were changes to the height of <b>the</b> <b>bulkheads.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bulkheads</b> on Titanic extended 10 feet (3 m) above the water line. After the Titanic sank, <b>the</b> <b>bulkheads</b> on other ships were extended higher to make the compartments fully watertight.|$|R
5000|$|The armored belt, with a {{slope of}} 15°24', was 327 mm thick. <b>The</b> forward <b>bulkhead</b> and <b>the</b> after <b>bulkhead</b> were 233 mm thick. <b>The</b> forward <b>bulkhead</b> {{thickness}} was increased to 355 mm {{between the first}} and second platform decks.|$|R
5|$|By Day 6 (7 October) {{first of}} <b>the</b> <b>bulkheads</b> {{and most of}} the middle deck beams were in place.|$|R
5|$|Owing to air {{compression}} {{in front of}} the plane as it travelled at supersonic speed, the fuselage heated up and expanded by as much as 300mm (almost 1ft). The most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the flight engineer's console and <b>the</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> On some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight, the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap, wedging the cap when it shrank again. To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a heat sink for the heat from the air conditioning. The same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became heated, and a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|The Spitfire's {{airframe}} was complex: the streamlined, semi-monocoque duralumin fuselage {{featured a}} large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers, also known as frames, starting from frame number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings. Frame 5, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and accessories, and the loads imposed by the engine. This was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and, in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage longerons {{to the rest of the}} airframe. Behind <b>the</b> <b>bulkhead</b> were five 'U' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating was attached, and ended at the nineteenth, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames were oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several lightening holes to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the rudder post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} approach {{is required for}} <b>the</b> design of <b>bulkheads</b> including consideration of the longevity of building materials, quality control during construction and methods to monitor performance of <b>the</b> retention system. <b>Bulkhead</b> site preparation and construction method using wet mix concrete is described with particular reference to anchoring <b>the</b> <b>bulkheads</b> to <b>the</b> strata with keys and steel bolts and post-construction resin injection of the concrete/strata interface...|$|R
5000|$|Most of the {{spacecraft}} systems were {{at the front of}} the cylinder, up against <b>the</b> front <b>bulkhead.</b> <b>The</b> crew were seated in one row near <b>the</b> rear <b>bulkhead</b> and access hatch, with 2 [...] "crew" [...] seats on the sides with flight controls on <b>the</b> rear <b>bulkhead</b> and one passenger in the middle. Cargo was carried in the middle of the capsule, at the capsule's center of gravity, to simplify loading effects on reentry angles and lift.|$|R
50|$|Fuselage: The plans {{state that}} a builder can {{increase}} the width and/or height of <b>the</b> <b>bulkheads</b> {{in an effort to}} make the fuselage more hospitable for larger pilots.|$|R
25|$|Anti-lock {{braking system}} (ABS) and Traction control system (TCS) (referred to as TCL on FTOs) {{can also be}} found as factory-fitted options on some earlier models such as the sports GX model. An easy-visual check for fitment of ABS to an FTO is to look in the engine bay - an alloy block, with six brake pipes emerging, will be present behind the battery and down against <b>the</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> ABS was {{standard}} equipment on facelift models.|$|E
25|$|The W124 also {{featured}} a driver's side airbag (optional in Europe, later {{standard in the}} USA), height-adjustable seat belts with electronic-mechanical pre-tensioneers (standard) for both front passengers, rear seat belts which automatically adapted {{to the size of}} the passengers (standard), pedals that were moved inversely in a frontal impact (away from the drivers feet and in the direction of <b>the</b> <b>bulkhead</b> separating the cabin from the engine) and door arm rests with deformable elements designed to reduce abdominal injury risk resulting from a side impact.|$|E
25|$|The {{pattern for}} the Union canton on this flag is {{different}} from the standard 31-star flag then in use. Perry's flag had columns of five stars save the last column which had six stars. Perry's US flag was unique when it was first flown in Tokyo Bay in 1853–1854. The replica of this historic flag on board the USS Missouri memorial is also placed in the same location on <b>the</b> <b>bulkhead</b> of the veranda deck where it had been initially mounted on the morning of September 2, 1945 by Chief Carpenter Fred Miletich.|$|E
5000|$|On Strasbourg, {{the armored}} belt had a 283 mm {{thickness}} and was inclined 11°50', <b>the</b> forward <b>bulkhead</b> was increased to 260 mm, and <b>the</b> after <b>bulkhead</b> to 210 mm ...|$|R
50|$|In his room, Adama notices large {{cracks in}} <b>the</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> and finally relents, calling Tyrol and {{telling him to}} do {{whatever}} it takes to save the ship, presumably including the Cylon-based biological structural reinforcements.|$|R
50|$|Admiral Nakhimov lacked proper ventilation, {{which was}} the reason all 90 windows in the cabins were open during <b>the</b> accident. <b>The</b> <b>bulkheads</b> that would have {{prevented}} the ship from sinking were removed during the conversion.|$|R
25|$|Air New Zealand offers audio {{video on}} demand in all classes on {{international}} services on its aircraft. The AVOD system, branded KiaOra, features multiple channels of video, audio, music, and games. Passengers can start and stop programs, plus rewind and fast-forward as desired. It is a gate-to-gate in-flight entertainment experience: passengers can start their entertainment {{as soon as they}} board the aircraft, and continue until they arrive at the gate of their destination, maximising play time, which is especially useful for its short-haul Tasman and Pacific Island flights. Gate-to-gate in-flight entertainment is not available on certain seats in economy (such as <b>the</b> <b>bulkhead</b> and emergency exit row seats).|$|E
25|$|On 2 June 2013, {{investigators}} from the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation of Afghanistan confirmed the load shift hypothesis {{as the starting}} point: three armoured vehicles and two mine-sweeping vehicles, totalling 80 tons of weight, had not been properly secured. At least one armoured vehicle had broken loose on takeoff and rolled backwards, slamming into the airplane's rear bulkhead, puncturing <b>the</b> <b>bulkhead</b> and knocking out the Cockpit Voice Recorder and Flight Data Recorder. This also crippled hydraulic systems 1 and 2 and damaged the horizontal stabilizer components - most notably the jackscrew, which rendered the airplane uncontrollable. Control of the aircraft was therefore lost, with the abnormal pitch-up rotation, stall, and crash to the ground ensuing. The damage to the tail controls and hydraulic systems {{made it impossible for}} the crew to regain control of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|East of the station, {{the center}} tracks also {{continue}} disused along Houston, but rise to an upper level and stub-end near Avenue A at bumper blocks. Near the end, these tail tracks begin to separate {{to create a}} provision for a center track which only extends about 10 or 15 feet and stops at <b>the</b> <b>bulkhead</b> {{at the end of}} the tunnel. It was planned that these tracks would continue under the East River to the South Fourth Street Line, part of a never-built system expansion. These tracks east of the station were previously used for train storage but became an oft-frequented spot for the homeless due to its location near local missions and soup kitchens. The area was cleared out in 1990, and corrugated metal walls with bumper blocks were installed just past the east end of the platforms to seal the tunnels.|$|E
5000|$|The belt armor was {{designed}} to withstand shell hits from the 280 mm German naval guns. Inclined 11°30', it was 225 mm thick, with <b>the</b> fore <b>bulkhead</b> 210 mm, and <b>the</b> aft <b>bulkhead</b> 180 mm ...|$|R
25|$|The M7A was an open-wheeled {{single-seater}} with a mid-mounted engine {{driving the}} rear wheels. The chassis was a bathtub-type (i.e. open-topped) monocoque made from 22-gauge aluminium alloy and 20-gauge magnesium alloy panels glued and riveted {{together and to}} three steel <b>bulkheads.</b> <b>The</b> monocoque terminated behind the driver's seat and the engine {{was used as a}} stressed part of the chassis, bolted directly to <b>the</b> rearmost <b>bulkhead.</b> <b>The</b> gearbox was then attached behind the engine, and the rear suspension – consisting of lateral top links, twin radius arms and reversed wishbones– attached to the gearbox and <b>the</b> rear <b>bulkhead.</b> <b>The</b> front suspension – upper and lower lateral links and radius arms – and the steering column were attached to <b>the</b> two <b>bulkheads</b> in front of the driver. Coilover springs and Koni dampers mounted outside of the body were employed front and rear.|$|R

25|$|The ships {{have five}} holds fitted with tweendecks, four {{forwards}} and one abaft of the superstructure, {{with a total}} grain capacity of 31,181 cubic metres. The foremost hold, No. 1, is specially designed for the carriage of explosives for the mining industry, inflammable liquids and chemicals in packages, {{and for this reason}} has a separate seawater fire extinguishing system that {{can also be used to}} cool <b>the</b> <b>bulkhead</b> between the foremost holds. Lower holds No. 2, 3 and 4 are designed for bulk cargoes such as coal, ore and grain. Containers can be carried in all holds and on the hatch covers, and the total container capacity of the SA-15 class ships is 576 twenty-foot equivalent units, forty of which can be refrigerated, or 236 forty-foot equivalent units. In addition the ships can carry special ten-foot ore concentrate containers in holds No. 2, 3 and 4, with two layers on tank top and one on tweendeck.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} damaged {{watertight}} {{door of the}} firemen's tunnel, the watertight door between boiler rooms six and five failed to close properly. Water was flowing further aft into boiler room five. Britannic had reached her flooding limit. She could stay afloat (motionless) with her first six watertight compartments flooded. There were five watertight bulkheads rising {{all the way up}} to B Deck. Those measures had been taken after the Titanic disaster. (Titanic could float with her first four compartments flooded.) The next crucial bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four and its door were undamaged and should have guaranteed the ship's survival. However, there were open portholes along the lower decks, which tilted underwater within minutes of the explosion. The nurses had opened most of those portholes to ventilate the wards. As the ship's angle of list increased, water reached this level and began entering aft from <b>the</b> <b>bulkhead</b> between boiler rooms five and four. With more than six compartments flooded, Britannic could not stay afloat.|$|E
25|$|During the air raid, she was hit {{directly}} by either {{one or two}} bombs; one struck the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>bulkhead,</b> between compartments X1 and X11, breaking off the fore-end just behind her No. 2 gun pivot. A later bomb hit her aft, fracturing the stern aft of her No. 4 gun position and causing her quarterdecks to hang at an angle. At this point, numerous holes and cracks had formed in the hull, causing her to flood with water and sink to the bottom. Later on a crane from the nearby dockyard would fall across her deck, above her after motor room. After the war, on 21 January 1948, the Weser Port Salvage Authorities called for tenders to assist in her breaking up. A number of quotations were given, ranging from 130,000 to 200,000 Reichsmark, and from four to 13 months' duration. Eventually a contract was placed on 17 February 1948, with Deutsches Dampfschiffahrts Hansa, for 132,000 RM and eight months work. Her breaking up was finished on February 1949.|$|E
5|$|Corrosion, {{due to a}} lack of maintenance, {{affected}} the seals of the hatch covers and the strength of <b>the</b> <b>bulkheads</b> which separate holds. The corrosion is difficult to detect due to the immense size of the surfaces involved.|$|R
50|$|Ajax was {{converted}} to a blockship with screw propulsion for coastal defence (also called 'steam-guard-ships') in 1846. The conversion process involved removing her copper, ballast and some of <b>the</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> and cutting her down {{in the shape of}} a blockship.|$|R
50|$|MS 61 {{trailers}} formerly had a {{first class}} section: Syndicat des Transports Parisiens (STP, now STIF) abolished first class travel on 1 September 1999, and <b>the</b> <b>bulkheads</b> that divided <b>the</b> {{first and second}} class sections were removed in the second refurbishment.|$|R
25|$|At 11:30 PM on {{the evening}} of Saturday June 8, 1990, an {{explosion}} in the cargo room of the Norwegian oil tanker the Mega Borg “ruptured <b>the</b> <b>bulkhead</b> between the pump room and the engine room”, causing the ship to catch fire and begin to leak oil. The 853-foot-long, 15-year-old vessel was about 50 {{miles off the coast of}} Galveston, Texas when the explosion occurred. The weather at the time was calm and the tanker had easily passed Coast Guard safety inspections in April earlier that year. While the direct cause of the engine room explosion remains unknown, the initial blast occurred during a lightening process in which the Mega Borg was transferring oil onto a smaller Italian tanker, the Fraqmura, in order to then transport the oil to Houston. This transfer was necessary, as the Mega Borg was too large to dock at the Texas port. Three million gallons of the total 38 million gallons of light Angolan Palanca crude oil on board the tanker were able to be transferred to the Fraqmura before the blast.|$|E
25|$|The LCA {{had a long}} central {{well section}} fitted with three benches, one centre, one each port and starboard, for seating troops. The side benches were covered by the top deck. The well was divided from the bow by a {{bulkhead}} fitted with two vertically hinged doors. This pair of forward-opening armour-plate doors led to the ramp, which was lowered and raised by a simple arrangement of pulleys and wire. Two rollers on the leading outboard edge providing some freedom of movement for the ramp when it was grounded. Over this ramp troops could come ashore {{in two to three}} minutes, or less if the soldiers and crews were well trained. Immediately behind <b>the</b> <b>bulkhead</b> were the steering shelter on the starboard, and the Lewis gun shelter on the port. The steering shelter was fitted with a telegraph and voice pipe for communication with the stoker, a featherspray control lever, and a fold-up seat. The shelter was protected on all four sides by non-magnetic bulletproof plate surmounted by a hinged double-door roof. Most LCAs were fitted with a compass.|$|E
25|$|On the bridge, Captain Bartlett {{was already}} {{considering}} efforts {{to save the}} ship, despite its increasingly dire condition. Only two minutes after the blast, boiler rooms five and six had to be evacuated. In about ten minutes, Britannic was roughly in the same condition Titanic had been in one hour after the collision with the iceberg. Fifteen minutes after the ship was struck, the open portholes on E Deck were underwater. With water also entering the ship's aft section from <b>the</b> <b>bulkhead</b> between boiler rooms four and five, Britannic quickly developed a serious list to starboard due to {{the weight of the}} water flooding into the starboard side. With the shores of the Greek island Kea to the right, Bartlett gave the order to navigate the ship towards the island in attempt to beach the vessel. The effect of the ship's starboard list and the weight of the rudder made attempts to navigate the ship under its own power difficult, and the steering gear was knocked out by the explosion, which eliminated steering by the rudder. However, the captain ordered the port shaft driven at a higher speed than the starboard side, which helped the ship move towards the island.|$|E

2500|$|Each {{vessel was}} {{modified}} by strengthening her bow by filling the interior with solid oak, planking over the forward 20 feet (6.1 meters) with oak sheathing, and covering the sheath with railroad iron 1 inch (25 millimeters) thick. The engines were {{protected by a}} double <b>bulkhead.</b> <b>The</b> inner <b>bulkhead</b> was made of pine beams 12 inches (30 centimeters) square, the outer of beams 6 inches by 12 inches (15 centimeters by 30 centimeters). <b>The</b> outer <b>bulkhead</b> was plated over with railroad iron like that on the bow, 1 inch (25 millimeters) thick. The space between <b>the</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> 22 inches (56 centimeters), was packed with compressed cotton. Although the cotton was the least {{important part of the}} armor, it caught the public fancy, and the vessels that received this kind of armor came to be called [...] "cottonclads." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} lessen the chances of the boat sinking {{in the event of}} damage to the hull, they were divided into six {{watertight}} compartments. Provided that <b>the</b> <b>bulkheads</b> were not damaged, the boat could remain afloat with any one compartment flooded.|$|R
