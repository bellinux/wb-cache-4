25|$|Although {{research}} {{has suggested that}} {{it is very difficult to}} eliminate the bias, some factors may help in closing the gap of the optimistic bias between an individual and their <b>target</b> <b>risk</b> group. First, by placing the comparison group closer to the individual, the optimistic bias can be reduced: studies found that when individuals were asked to make comparisons between themselves and close friends, there was almost no difference in the likelihood of an event occurring. Additionally, actually experiencing an event leads to a decrease in the optimistic bias. While this only applies to events with prior experience, knowing the previously unknown will result in less optimism of it not occurring.|$|E
25|$|Optimism bias is {{typically}} measured through two determinants of risk: absolute risk, where individuals {{are asked to}} estimate their likelihood of experiencing a negative event compared to their actual chance of experiencing a negative event (comparison against self), and comparative risk, where individuals are asked to estimate the likelihood of experiencing a negative event (their personal risk estimate) compared to others {{of the same age}} and sex (a <b>target</b> <b>risk</b> estimate). Problems can occur when trying to measure absolute risk because it is extremely difficult to determine the actual risk statistic for a person. Therefore, the optimistic bias is primarily measured in comparative risk forms, where people compare themselves against others, through direct and indirect comparisons. Direct comparisons ask whether an individual's own risk of experiencing an event is less than, greater than, or equal to someone else's risk, while indirect comparisons ask individuals to provide separate estimates of their own risk of experiencing an event and other's risk of experiencing the same event.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{results of}} {{postoperative}} delirium (POD) warrant testing for prevention. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine whether a nursing intervention <b>targeting</b> <b>risk</b> factors could decrease the incidence of POD among patients who had coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in China. Methods: A prospective before-after study was conducted between April 2014 and April 2015. A nursing delirium intervention protocol <b>targeting</b> <b>risk</b> factors for delirium was performed for 141 patients undergoing CABG in a cardiothoracic ICU from November 2014 to April 2015. Intervention consisted of screening for delirium risk factors, followed by <b>targeted</b> <b>risk</b> factor modification, including pain control, early catheter removal, patient orientation using the 5 W 1 H procedure, increased family visits, minimizing care-related interruptions, comfortable nursing and monitoring for sleeping difficulties. Outcomes of the Intervention Group were compared with those of the Control Group for 137 CABG patients from April 2014 to October 2014. Delirium was assessed using the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU). The sample size was justified by PASS 2000, based on previous data of delirium incidence in our institution (30 %). Main results: Delirium incidence during the first seven postoperative days was significantly lower in the Intervention Group at 13. 48 % (19 / 141) vs. 29. 93 % (41 / 137) for the Control Group (χ 2  =  11. 112, P =  0. 001). In addition, POD in the Intervention Group occurred between the 3 rd and 6 th postoperative days, while POD in the Control Group mainly occurred on the first three days postoperatively. Delirium in the Intervention Group occurred later than delirium in the Control Group (χ 2  =  12. 743, P <  0. 001). Length of ICU stay was reduced significantly (Z = − 6. 026, P <  0. 001). Conclusion: The application of a nursing protocol <b>targeting</b> <b>risk</b> factors in this study seems to be associated with a lower incidence of POD in patients after CABG.

40|$|In Wilde's risk {{homeostasis}} theory, it {{is assumed}} that people have a <b>target</b> <b>risk</b> which guides their behaviour. The prime purpose of this experimental on-road study was to establish the effect of the need for stimulation or sensation seeking on this <b>target</b> <b>risk.</b> in addition, the relationship between sensation seeking and accident history was explored. Based on their score on Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale, 21 male sensation avoiders and 21 male sensation seekers were invited to participate in a controlled car-driving experiment. To control for the influence of driver experience on both <b>target</b> <b>risk</b> and accident involvement, equal numbers of inexperienced, intermediately experienced and experienced participants were selected. While following another car at a distance chosen by the participant, <b>target</b> <b>risk</b> was measured by time-headway - an index of risk taking, and verbal ratings - indices of cognitively perceived risk. Accident involvement was measured by reported past accidents. As expected on the basis of risk homeostasis theory, sensation avoiders preferred a greater following distance than sensation seekers. Unexpectedly, however, they did not perceive this longer following distance as less risky. Therefore, it was concluded that sensation seekers did not take more risk deliberately. The results of a Poisson regression analysis gave preliminary evidence for an influence of sensation seeking on the relationship between driver experience and accident involvement. For drivers with an experience of less than approximately 80, 000 kilometres it was observed that sensation avoiders had been less liable to accidents than sensation seekers, whereas for drivers who had driven more than 80, 000 kilometres, the accident involvement of sensation avoiders was greater than that of sensation seekers. The observation that sensation seekers become involved in accidents earlier in their driving career than sensation avoiders is discussed by referring to the observation that sensation seekers drove in a more risky fashion (e. g. shorter time-headway) without perceiving their behaviour to be more risky.

40|$|Flooding {{has been}} a {{pressing}} problem for communities around the world. The problem is expected to worsen due to climate change and sea level rise. Despite decades of research on risk communication and management, the toll of flooding continues to mount. In order to advance flood management to minimize future damages, {{there is a need}} to foster collaboration among research communities, promote the genuine engagement of local stakeholders, and co-develop <b>targeted</b> <b>risk</b> communication and mitigation strategies between experts and non-experts. 	This dissertation experimented with different participatory approaches, such as household surveys, cognitive mapping, and focus group discussions, in order to respectively (1) examine how one’s spatial awareness of flood risk is influenced by the interactions between social, geographical, informational, and hydrological factors, (2) identify differences in expert and non-expert flood knowledge, and (3) integrate diverse stakeholder perspectives in the future development of flood visualizations. Our findings indicate that flood awareness varies significantly between social groups from different geographical regions with different personal characteristics, which point to the need for <b>targeted</b> <b>risk</b> communication and outreach activities in order to address the concern of risk variability. Moreover, we found that while details and realism in flood visualizations can have positive cognitive and affective impacts on users, it is crucial for experts to be cognizant of stakeholders’ background and expertise as these factors may influence their visualization preferences. Although flood risk awareness is one of the precursors to the adoption of mitigation and preparatory measures, and flood visualizations have the potential to positively impact one’s awareness. We have demonstrated that one’s response to flood information can be influenced by the complex feedback of social, geographical, informational, and hydrological factors. Thus, rather than looking at the development of flood model or flood visualizations as an end in itself, we must look to more adaptive and “no-regret” strategies such as the development of <b>targeted</b> <b>risk</b> communication campaigns and the accumulation of social capital as means to promoting risk mitigation behaviors, which can ultimately increase community resilience in light of the growing problem of flooding...|$|R

40|$|Optimizing risk {{measures}} such as Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of a general loss distribution is usually difficult, because 1) the loss function might lack structural properties such as convexity or differentiability since it is often generated via black-box simulation of a stochastic system; 2) evaluation of risk measures often requires rare-event simulation, which is computationally expensive. In this paper, we study {{the extension of the}} recently proposed gradient-based adaptive stochastic search (GASS) to the optimization of risk measures VaR and CVaR. Instead of optimizing VaR or CVaR at the <b>target</b> <b>risk</b> level directly, we incorporate an adaptive updating scheme on the risk level, by initializing the algorithm at a small risk level and adaptively increasing it until the <b>target</b> <b>risk</b> level is achieved while the algorithm converges at the same time.

40|$|The optimistic bias {{is defined}} as judging one’s own risk as less than the risk of oth-ers. Researchers have {{identified}} numerous personal and situational factors that moderate {{the extent to which}} people display the bias. It is unclear, however, whether these moderators affect the bias by influencing people’s personal risk esti-mates or their risk estimates for a target. A review of moderators of the optimistic bias reveals evidence for both influences. Moderators associated with negative af-fect (negative mood, dysphoria, trait and state anxiety, event severity, and proxim-ity of feedback) and control related moderators (perceived control and prior expe-rience) appear primarily to affect personal risk estimates. Positive mood affects <b>target</b> <b>risk</b> estimates. Finally, moderators that surround the comparison process appear to have different effects.

Yet, effective population-wide preventive measures <b>targeting</b> <b>risks</b> {{in the region are}} still largely unavailable. We aimed to review population-wide and individual-level interventions addressing risk factors of IHD among adults in sSA. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health and AJOL was conducted to identify studies focusing on population-wide and individuallevel interventions <b>targeting</b> <b>risks</b> of IHD among adults in sSA. We conducted a detailed synthesis of basic findings of selected studies. Results: A total of 2311 studies were identified, with only 9 studies meeting our selection criteria. 3 broad interventions were identified: dietary modifications, physical activity and community-based health promotion measures on tobacco and alcohol cessation. 3 studies reported significant reduction in blood pressure (BP), and another study reported statistically significant reduction in mean total cholesterol. Other outcome measures observed ranged from mild to no reduction in BP, blood glucose, body mass index and total cholesterol, respectively. Conclusions: We cannot specify with all certainty contextually feasible interventions that can be effective in modifying IHD risk factors in population groups across sSA.
