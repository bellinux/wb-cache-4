5|$|Forman {{based his}} story on a {{real-world}} incident {{from his past}} and the filmmakers focused much of their attention on <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> real-life look and feel by filming on location in a small Czech town with a shoe factory of its own, utilizing a largely non-professional cast, relying on {{a considerable amount of}} dialogue improvisation, and employing documentary-style cinematographic techniques.|$|E
5|$|While {{the central}} plot is a murder mystery, the initial idea {{was of a}} writer with PTSD who cannot write and is instead {{fronting}} for his blacklisted best friend. Throughout the series, Brubaker switched between first- and third-person narration because it allowed him to tell a broader story. He was also <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> layered story that would reward repeated reading, so he avoided extraneous details. When writing the scripts, Brubaker listened to music from the 1940s {{to stay in the}} right frame of mind.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert started {{developing}} {{what came to}} be known as the Society of Mind theory which views biological brain as massively parallel computer. In 1986, Minsky published The Society of Mind, which claims that “mind is formed from many little agents, each mindless by itself”. The theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non-intelligent parts. Minsky says that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> machine that uses a robotic arm, a video camera, and a computer to build with children's blocks.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1170s Henry focused on <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> stable system of government, {{increasingly}} ruling through his family, but tensions over the succession arrangements were never far away, ultimately {{leading to a}} fresh revolt. Having quelled the left-over rebels from the Great Revolt, Richard was recognised by Henry as the Duke of Aquitaine in 1179. In 1181 Geoffrey finally married Constance and became Duke of Brittany; by now most of Brittany accepted Angevin rule, and Geoffrey was {{able to deal with}} the remaining disturbances on his own. John had spent the Great Revolt travelling alongside his father and most observers now began to regard the prince as Henry's favourite child. Henry began to grant John more lands, mostly at various nobles' expense, and in 1177 made him the Lord of Ireland. Meanwhile, Young Henry spent {{the end of the decade}} travelling in Europe, taking part in tournaments and playing only a passing role in either government or Henry and Richard's military campaigns; he was increasingly dissatisfied with his position and lack of power.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression in the 1930s, the {{governors}} again began to reassert authority. The Executive Reorganization Act was passed, returning the governor to a considerable level of appointment power. New state welfare and regulatory agencies were placed directly under the governor's control, greatly expanding his role in running the state and creating a large number of patronage positions. The legislature responded by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> merit system for public offices, but it was largely unable to effectively enforce it given the new scope of government agencies. The battle with the governor continued until 1941, when the legislature rescinded the Executive Reorganization Act and replaced it with the State Administration Act, which placed most of the government under the control of elected commissioners and reduced the governor's practical executive authority to commander of the militia and the executor of legislation. The matter was taken to the Indiana Supreme Court in the case of Tucker v. State. The court ruled {{for the first time that}} the governor was in fact the Chief Executive of the state, and that the legislature could pass no law that infringed upon that right. The decision was a major shift from previous court decisions and granted governors a legal basis to resist future encroachment on their powers.|$|E

25|$|While {{scientists}} were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> new antidepressant to inhibit the NE re-uptake they accidentally synthesised two new compounds, named talopram and talsupram. The two compounds where not marketed {{in spite of}} being potent SNRIs {{because of the fact}} that number of suicide attempts were reported in clinical trials. With minor changes to the chemical structure of talopram (figure 6), including a single 6-cyano (CN) substitution, {{scientists were}} able to convert talopram into a potent SSRI, called citalopram. But citalopram can also be viewed as a constrained analogue of paroxetine.|$|E
25|$|Another {{challenge}} of feminist historians is integration in digital format.

This creates a problem for feminist historians <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> feminist history database based on women’s history databases. Since data mining is not a field many digital humanist women are involved in, it can be a challenge to find the necessary relationships between these few. Though Filene argues that data mining {{is the best way to}} integrate histories, this lack of involvement by feminist digital humanists detaches the work from others sharing similar feminist historian’s work.|$|E

25|$|During a {{discussion}} about the potential plot of the game's sequel BioShock 2, editor Hilary Goldstein said that Ryan should reappear in it, and that while it should be in a new area, it should still have connections to him. Onyett called Ryan a key element, and if not included in the sequel, there would be a dramatic loss of personality. He claimed that much of Rapture's personality comes from Ryan, and it would have much less of an impact without him. Editor Ryan Geddes agreed, adding that he felt there was more to Ryan than Rapture. Editor Nate Ahem suggested that the game's sequel, BioShock 2, could potentially put the players in the role of Ryan, to explore the story of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> perfect world and having it crumble beneath their feet.|$|E
25|$|The joint {{command of}} ARBiH, HVO and Croatian Army (HV) was {{established}} in March 1995. The closer cooperation between Croats and Bosniaks was made through the Split Agreement where Bosnia and Herzegovina's Muslim leaders allowed the Croatian Army to free western part of Bosnia and Herzegovina with cooperation with ARBiH. After the Operation Storm, the Serbian hoop around Bihać was broken and Croatian and Bosnian armies continued to liberate western Bosnia. The UN unsuccessfully tried to establish peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> successful structure for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The UN showed a total inability when Serbs conquered UN-protected towns, Srebrenica and Žepa. Serbs launched {{an attack on the}} UN-protected town of Bihać, but they were stopped by the Croatian army during Operation Storm.
