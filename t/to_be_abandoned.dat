5|$|Early {{reports on}} the {{centrifugal}} method indicated {{that it was not}} as efficient as predicted. Urey suggested that a more efficient but technically more complicated countercurrent system be used instead of the previous flow-through method. By November 1941, technical obstacles seemed formidable enough for the process <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>abandoned.</b> Countercurrent centrifuges were developed after the war, and today are the favored method in many countries.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the encirclement of the 6th Army on 23 November 1942, the Geschwaderstab was moved to Morozovskaya-West, outside the Stalingrad pocket. Wilcke organized fighter escort missions for the transport aircraft delivering supplies for the 6th Army. Pressed by the advancing Soviet armored spearheads, Morozovskaya-West had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> by the Geschwaderstab on 23 December, and the aircraft were moved to Morozovskaya-South, which was not yet threatened by the Soviet Army. On 3 January 1943, this airfield had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> as well and the Geschwaderstab was relocated to Tazinskaya, there it remained until the fighting over the Stalingrad pocket ended. During this period the Geschwaderstab claimed 25 victories, 21 by Wilcke and 4 by Dahl, for the loss in action of two pilots.|$|E

5|$|After the Mariner and Viking {{spacecraft}} {{had returned}} pictures of Mars as it really is, an apparently lifeless and canal-less world, these ideas about Mars had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>abandoned,</b> and a vogue for accurate, realist depictions of human colonies on Mars developed, {{the best known}} of which may be Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy. Pseudo-scientific speculations about the Face on Mars and other enigmatic landmarks spotted by space probes have meant that ancient civilizations continue to be a popular theme in science fiction, especially in film.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the issues}} the Dutch {{designers}} were having with a propulsion system were discussed, the delegation {{came away from}} Italy entirely uninspired by the Italians' efforts in that area. On the other hand, the visit provoked a drastic reworking of the internal subdivision of the proposed battlecruisers. The designers {{got rid of the}} previously required central longitudinal bulkhead and attempted to raise the double bottom to provide greater protection against magnetic torpedoes. However, due to the requirement for a shallow draft, this modification had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>abandoned.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1853 the Royal Society's {{project was}} concluded, and the {{observatory}} was set <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>abandoned.</b> After a lengthy debate, the fledgling colonial government {{decided to take}} over its operation. Rather than disappearing like its three counterparts, the Toronto observatory was upgraded, and its mission was expanded as it became a meteorological station (see Meteorological Service of Canada) {{under the direction of}} the Ministry of Marine and Fisheries. During the expansion, the original buildings were replaced with a permanent structure.|$|E

5|$|In August 1941 an {{artillery}} unit {{was formed to}} attack Italian forts more effectively. Initially it used a QF 4.5-inch howitzer carried on a 10-ton Mack NR 4 truck, with an accompanying light tank as an armoured observation post. However, these were {{handed over to the}} Free French at Kufra. The unit was then issued a 25 pounder portee. The LRDG successfully attacked and captured the fort at El Gtafia using the gun, but later the truck had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> and the experiment ended.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013 Liverpool City Council {{approved}} {{the acquisition of}} the Cunard Building for use as offices and as a cruise liner terminal. The council projected that the building would accommodate 1000 staff relocated from Millennium House and leases in the Capital Building, saving an estimated £1.3 million. The anticipated use as cruise terminal however had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> due to the high costs associated with security and border control.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{work began}} on the rock on 7 August 1838. Stevenson and 21 workmen arrived on board the sailing vessel Pharos and began to unload the barrack, whose massive legs were set into holes blasted out of the rock. After only two days the site had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> as a storm swept in from the Atlantic. It was a further six days before they could resume the {{punishing}} schedule of 16 hours a day work between 4am and 8pm. Fearing sea sickness, many of the man preferred to attempt {{to sleep on the}} damp rocks than on the ever-rolling Pharos.|$|E

5|$|Losses for 12 July are {{difficult}} to establish for either combatant. Tank losses attributed to the German side vary, {{in part due to}} the Wehrmacht's methodology for counting and reporting equipment losses. Only equipment that could not be repaired or that had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> were counted as losses, but damaged equipment that could be recovered and repaired were simply listed as such. Likewise, reliable figures for tank and personnel casualties for the Red Army in the Battle of Prokhorovka {{are difficult}} to establish.|$|E
5|$|Major General Auguste Gilliaert {{arrived from}} the Congo {{before the end of}} the month. On 27 June General William Platt, {{advancing}} with British forces from Sudan, ordered the Belgians to attack the Italian positions if an opportunity presented itself and Gilliaert immediately undertook preparations for an offensive. The plans for taking Mogi were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> and the Belgians were to concentrate their efforts against Saïo and all but 50 of the soldiers besieging it were redeployed.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 15 May SS-Standarte Deutschland {{approached}} the Zanddijk Position. A first attack around 08:00 on outposts of the northern sector was easily repulsed, as the Germans had to advance over a narrow dike through the inundations, despite supporting air strikes by dive bombers. However, the bombardment caused the battalions in the main positions to flee, and the entire line had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> around 14:00 despite the southern part being supported by the French torpedo boat L'Incomprise.|$|E

5|$|Such serials exist {{during the}} tenure {{of each of the}} {{previous}} eleven incarnations of the Doctor. The reasons for the serials being incomplete include strike action (which caused the partially filmed Shada <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>abandoned),</b> actors leaving roles (The Final Game, which was cancelled after Roger Delgado's death), and the series being put on hiatus twice—once in 1985, and again in 1989—causing the serials planned for the following series to be shelved.|$|E
5|$|The California Highway Commission {{considered}} several easterly routes between Saugus and Gorman: Soledad Canyon (used by the Southern Pacific) had frequent washouts; Mint Canyon (used by the Midway Route) was {{too long}} and cost too much; Bouquet Canyon (used by both automobile routes) had bad drainage; and San Francisquito Canyon (used by the Tejon Pass Route) was steep and narrow. Another possible route, through Piru Canyon to the west, was rejected because of {{a proposal for a}} dam. This route was later chosen for the Ridge Route Alternate, but had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> in the 1970s due to the construction of Pyramid Lake.|$|E
5|$|The {{critical}} {{decision for}} the Saigon government was made two days later at Cam Ranh Bay during a meeting between Thiệu and General Phu.

Phu informed the president that the only route possible for the redeployment, given PAVN blocking actions, was little-used Interprovincial Route 7B, a neglected, narrow, rough-surfaced track (actually a logging road) with several downed bridges along its course.|$|E

5|$|A {{regional}} {{transit authority}} {{was formed in}} the early 1990s to build and operate a light rail system that would use the bus tunnel within Downtown Seattle. The authority, later named Sound Transit, gained voter approval in November 1996 to build a $3.9billion system between Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, Downtown Seattle, and the University District. In 1998, Sound Transit found that the rails in the tunnel {{would need to be}} replaced at a cost of up to $110 million and require a full closure for two years. The plan would also require the purchase of new hybrid electric buses to replace the Breda fleet, as the electrical systems were incompatible. Convention Place station would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> as it was too shallow to support a northern extension under Interstate 5.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} bird families, {{pelicans}} {{are susceptible to}} a variety of parasites. Specialist feather lice of the genus Piagetella are found in the pouches of all species of pelican, but are otherwise only known from New World and Antarctic cormorants. Avian malaria is carried by the mosquito Culex pipens, and high densities of these biting insects may force pelican colonies <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>abandoned.</b> Leeches may attach to the vent or sometimes the inside of the pouch. A study of the parasites of the American white pelican found 75 different species, including tapeworms, flukes, flies, fleas, ticks and nematodes. Many of these do little harm, but flies may be implicated in the death of nestlings, particularly if they are weak or unwell, and the soft tick Ornithodoros capensis sometimes causes adults to desert the nest. Many pelican parasites are found in other bird groups, but several lice are very host-specific.|$|E
