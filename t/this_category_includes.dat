500|$|According to exegetes such as Iorga, Constantin Șăineanu and Voncu, {{the moral}} lesson of Agârbiceanu's lay works is only hinted at, with much subtlety. Voncu sees in Luncușoara din Păresemi the [...] "refinement and objectivity" [...] of novels by Georges Bernanos. On the other hand, Voncu observes {{that the writer}} uses his artistic talents in {{theological}} works such as Despre minuni ("About Miracles") and Din pildele Domnului, ably narrating simple texts that can appeal either to their intended audience of rural believers or to a more cultivated set of readers. As Z. Ornea notes, Agârbiceanu's least known works are particularly moralizing. <b>This</b> <b>category</b> <b>includes</b> two stories of moral redemption, the novel Sfântul and the short novella Pustnicul Pafnutie și ucenicul său Ilarion ("Pafnutie the Hermit and Ilarion His Apprentice"), which are [...] "entirely tactless".|$|E
500|$|Within {{the range}} of mass-classifiers, authors have {{proposed}} subdivisions based on {{the manner in which}} a mass-classifier organizes the noun into countable units. One of these is measurement units (also called [...] "standard measures"), which all languages must have in order to measure items; <b>this</b> <b>category</b> <b>includes</b> units such as kilometers, liters, or pounds (see list). Like other classifiers, these can also stand without a noun; thus, for example, (bàng, pound) may appear as both (sān [...] ròu, [...] "three [...] of meat") or just (sān , [...] "three [...] ", never *sān [...] ). Units of currency behave similarly: for example, 十 (shí , [...] "ten [...] "), which is short for (for example) 十人民币 (shí [...] rénmínbì, [...] "ten [...] of renminbi"). Other proposed types of mass-classifiers include [...] "collective" [...] mass-classifiers, such as (yì [...] rén, [...] "a [...] of people"), which group things less precisely; and [...] "container" [...] mass-classifiers which group things by containers they come in, as in (yì [...] zhōu, [...] "a [...] of porridge") or (yì [...] táng, [...] "a [...] of sugar").|$|E
