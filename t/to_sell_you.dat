You've got to be right or wrong. I love the satisfaction when you are right — and the agony when you are wrong." [...] Hochuli finds similarities between the football field and courtroom saying, [...] "On the football field, people like that I'm in charge and know what I'm doing, {{but a lot of the}} time, it's just appearance. [...] I'm going <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>you</b> on my decision. It's the same in the courtroom. You don't stand in front of a jury and say, 'I think my client is innocent.' You say, 'We're right!'" ...|$|E
500|$|The SCLC's {{goals were}} {{to fill the}} jails with protesters to force the city {{government}} to negotiate as demonstrations continued. However, not enough people were arrested to affect {{the functioning of the}} city and the wisdom of the plans were being questioned in the black community. The editor of The Birmingham World, the city's black newspaper, called the direct actions by the demonstrators [...] "wasteful and worthless", and urged black citizens to use the courts to change the city's racist policies. Most white residents of Birmingham expressed shock at the demonstrations. White religious leaders denounced King and the other organizers, saying that [...] "a cause should be pressed in the courts and the negotiations among local leaders, and not in the streets". Some white Birmingham residents were supportive as the boycott continued. When one black woman entered Loveman's department store to buy her children Easter shoes, a white saleswoman said to her, [...] "Negro, ain't you ashamed of yourself, your people out there on the street getting put in jail and you in here spending money and I'm not going <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>you</b> any, you'll have to go some other place." [...] King promised a protest every day until [...] "peaceful equality had been assured" [...] and expressed doubt that the new mayor would ever voluntarily desegregate the city.|$|E

500|$|The {{full-motion video}} aspect of GH Live {{was not as}} well-taken as the core gameplay. GameSpots Scott Buttersworth found that he often ignored the motion video as he was too focused on the gameplay, {{and when he did}} notice it, felt it {{appeared}} [...] "so campy [...] it borders on parody" [...] as it [...] "absolutely trips over itself <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>you</b> on the idea that you're a totally super cool rockstar". Tristan Ogilvie of IGN also felt that the live action footage was [...] "overly cheesy vamping", and further felt no connection to the band and bandmates he was to be playing along with as there was very little context given between sets. Ben Griffin of GamesRadar found that the crowd and bandmates only seemed to have two states, [...] "fawning and furious", making the transition disconcerting when the game switched between the two states simply based on his performance. Brandon Jones of GameTrailers believed it was difficult to [...] "take the actors seriously" [...] in part due to the duality of the crowd reaction as well as that the song was still based on studio recordings, sounding off in the concert setting. Jones further commented that the fictional bands were well-matched to the songs they played, and that the pacing of the presentation, moving quickly between songs, made the experience feel more like a real concert. McElroy acknowledged the presentation can potentially be [...] "cringe-worthy", but felt that the video was put together with self-awareness of this factor to make it more charming, noting some of the extra details that FreeStyleGames and the actors used to fully take on their roles.|$|E
500|$|Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune praised Rick Heinrichs's {{production}} design and Jim Carrey {{for having a}} balanced performance as a scene stealer. Elder called the film [...] "exceptionally clever, hilariously gloomy and bitingly subversive." [...] Desson Thomson from The Washington Post reasoned over a fellow film-goer's characterization of Count Olaf, [...] "Olaf is a humorless villain in the book. He's not amusing like Carrey at all. To which I would counter: If you can't let Carrey be Carrey, put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises he's rubbery, inventive and improvisationally inspired. I particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur." [...] Ty Burr, writing in The Boston Globe, observed, [...] "Director Brad Silberling has essentially made a Tim Burton movie without the weird shafts of adolescent pain. At the same time, Silberling's not a hack like Chris Columbus, and Snicket has more zip and inspired filmcraft than the first two Harry Potter films. The film's no masterpiece, but at least you're {{in the hands of}} people who know what they're doing. The movie, like the books, flatters children's innate sense that the world is not a perfect place and that anyone who insists otherwise is trying <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>you</b> something. How you deal with the cognitive dissonance of a $125 million Hollywood picture telling you this is up to you. At least there are no Lemony Snicket Happy Meals. Yet." [...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli felt that [...] "the film is first and foremost a fantasy, but there are dark currents running just beneath the surface. I give Silberling credit for not allowing them to swallow the film. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events manages to remain witty throughout." [...] Roger Ebert gave a mixed review: [...] "Jim Carrey is over the top as Count Olaf, but I suppose a character named Count Olaf is over the top by definition. I liked the film, but I'll tell you what. I think this one is a tune-up for the series, a trial run in which they figure out what works and what needs to be tweaked. The original Spider-Man was a disappointment, but the same team came back and made Spider-Man 2, the best superhero movie ever made." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety gave a negative review, criticizing the filmmakers for sacrificing the storyline in favor of visual elements such as set design and cinematography. He wrote, [...] "A Series of Unfortunate Events suggests what Mary Poppins might have looked like had Tim Burton directed it. Not surprisingly, Burton's longtime {{production design}}er Rick Heinrichs was responsible for the sets, while ace Emmanuel Lubezki (Burton's Sleepy Hollow) contributed the expressionistic lighting schemes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Last season, Murphy {{had spoken}} with Zachary Quinto about Dr. Oliver Thredson, who was {{revealed}} in [...] "Part 2" [...] {{as being the}} serial killer Bloody Face. Quinto stated the knowledge [...] "made {{it all the more}} fun for me to build the character {{in a way that made}} it seem like he was compassionate and supportive and concerned about the welfare of the patients at Briarcliff, but carrying these ulterior motives." [...] He added that Thredson [...] "carries a lot of secrets with him. He's very intelligent. But he's also very experienced at covering those sects and hiding them and maintaining them. There's a plan. He's fiercely intelligent, and obviously ruthless in his willingness to create this world he's making for himself. He's delusional within himself. He's not trying <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>you</b> a story. He's trying to believe it himself. You will learn more in the coming weeks about what motivated him to these horrific crimes." ...|$|E

2500|$|On Thursday, May 23, 1946, a 21-year-old ex Army Air Force B-24 machine-gunner by {{the name}} Ralph B. Baumann told Los Angeles police {{that he thought he}} might have been the Phantom. [...] "I've been in a coma; running from something. Maybe murder. I want to clear it up. If I didn't kill five people in Texarkana, I want to settle down and be a stunt man in Hollywood. I'm happiest when I'm living in danger." [...] Previously, he had gone to the Los Angeles Examiner and told a reporter, [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>you</b> some murder {{information}}. I know who and where the Texarkana Killer is. Give me $5 and let me have an hour's start and I'll put the information in a sealed envelope." [...] The reporter called the police after reading: On a certain day in March, I was in a Texarkana theater watching a Pathé news picture of war. When a party of persons acted wise and said [...] "overacting" [...] it kind of got me. I followed them home. I killed them within a period of three days.|$|E

5000|$|After {{moving back}} to the Twin Cities in the early 1990s, McFadden joined Goldsmith, Agio, Helms and Co., the {{investment}} firm that would later become Lazard Middle Market. The firm had approximately a dozen employees. By 2007, the company grew to over 90 employees in five cities. That year, McFadden was named co-CEO and the firm was sold to Lazard. McFadden's role at Lazard Middle Market was to advise privately held companies on mergers and acquisitions.
