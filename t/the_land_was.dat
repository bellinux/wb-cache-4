5|$|At {{this time}} the {{abundance}} of invertebrates crawling around on land and near water, in moist soil and wet litter, offered a food supply. Some were even big enough to eat small tetrapods, but <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> free from dangers common in the water.|$|E
5|$|For {{undisclosed}} reasons, Henry {{was unable}} to complete the land grant to Hinde due to surveying difficulties, who then used his nephew Hubbard Taylor to go to Kentucky, find the location, and complete the transaction. Hinde gave Taylor half of the lands for this service. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> in Clark County, Kentucky, between Winchester and Lexington.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of {{annexation}} as the Territory of Hawaii, <b>the</b> former Crown <b>lands</b> <b>were</b> given ("ceded") to the US Federal Government. When the Hawaii Admission Act made Hawaii a U.S. state, <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> <b>were</b> transferred to <b>the</b> state.

50|$|In {{commonwealth}} militaries, a <b>landing</b> zone <b>is</b> <b>the</b> cartographic (numeric) zone {{in which}} <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>is</b> {{going to take}} place (e.g., a valley). <b>The</b> <b>landing</b> area <b>is</b> <b>the</b> area in which <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>is</b> {{going to take place}} (e.g., the field where <b>the</b> aircraft <b>are</b> to <b>land).</b> <b>The</b> <b>landing</b> point <b>is</b> <b>the</b> point on which aircraft <b>are</b> going to <b>land</b> (e.g., a point of the field).

5|$|From 1893–1912, {{the team}} used area parks such as Brisbane Park, Ponce de Leon Park, and Piedmont Park {{as the home}} field. Georgia Tech took out a seven-year lease on {{what is now the}} {{southern}} end of Grant Field, although <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> not adequate for sports, due to its unleveled, rocky nature. In 1905, Heisman had 300 convict laborers clear rocks, remove tree stumps, and level out the field for play; Tech students then built a grandstand on the property. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> purchased by 1913, and John W. Grant donated $15,000 towards the construction of the field's first permanent stands; the field was named Grant Field in honor of the donor's deceased son, Hugh Inman Grant.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the colony, the land between Iron Cove and the Cooks River was known as the Kangaroo Ground. This {{suggests}} that <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> open terrain favoured by kangaroos, that they were common in the area and may have formed a significant part of the Aboriginal diet.|$|E
5|$|Lyttleton died in England in 1839. In {{disposing}} his estate, the estate's trustee {{put all of}} {{the lands}} up for sale.

The block of land containing the Lyttleton homestead was sold in 1843 to a Dr James Richardson, and the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> sold to others in 1848.|$|E

5|$|On July 15, 1961, to {{meet the}} burgeoning {{educational}} demands of South Florida, the state legislature passed an act authorizing {{the establishment of a}} new university in the City of Boca Raton. Florida Atlantic University was built on Boca Raton Army Airfield, a 1940s-era army airbase. During World War II, the airfield served as the Army Air Corps' sole radar training facility. The base was built on the existing Boca Raton Airport and on 5,860acres (23.7km²) of adjacent land. A majority of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> acquired from Japanese-American farmers from the failing Yamato Colony. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> seized through eminent domain, leaving many Japanese-Americans little recourse {{in the early days of}} World War II.|$|E

5|$|Place {{names such}} as Scale Haw {{indicate}} the Norse left their influence. There is no documentary record of the area until a mention in the Domesday Book of 1086, in which the settlement {{was referred to as}} Hebedene held by Osbern d'Arques, of Thorpe Arch.

5|$|Salem Chapel {{stands on}} land {{which had been}} part of the old Napoleonic Barrack Ground. Hence the name for the nearby Waterloo Road. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> {{auctioned}} in 1839, and in the following year the purchaser, a Mr George Gould, himself a Baptist, sold two plots fronting the London Road for the erection of a Baptist Chapel. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> purchased and fenced for the sum of £300 which was raised by way of a mortgage. The original meeting room, (now the Church Parlour) was built and opened in July 1840. The present chapel was completed and opened in 1847.|$|E

50|$|The Government {{has argued}} that <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> barren and not fit for cultivation. Hence a project in this place is favourable. But going by the photos {{published}} in the newspapers, it can be well concluded that <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> very much fertile.|$|R

50|$|In 970 <b>the</b> <b>land</b> around Newton and Hauxton {{was passed}} to King Edgar who offered them to Bishop Aethelwold {{for the new}} Abbey at Ely.

50|$|On all Apollo {{missions}} to <b>the</b> moon, <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> radar <b>was</b> required {{to acquire the}} surface before a <b>landing</b> could <b>be</b> attempted.

They did, the radar locked on just in time, and <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>was</b> completed.|$|R
5|$|The hall {{remained}} {{the seat of}} various branches of the Crewe family until 1936, when <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> sold to the Duchy of Lancaster.

5|$|After the Norman Conquest of England by William the Conqueror in 1066AD, {{the land}} in the East Riding was granted to {{followers}} of the new Norman king and ecclesiastical institutions.
