5|$|The next day, {{a general}} store {{delivery}} boy named Jimmy (Jack Parker) listens to a radio {{report about the}} Creeper's murders. The cantankerous store owner Mr. Haskins (Oscar O'Shea) arrives with a handwritten letter slipped under the door, requesting groceries be delivered to a nearby dock. Jimmy brings <b>the</b> <b>groceries</b> to the dock and leaves them at a door, where the Creeper takes them into his hideout. But, when Jimmy tries to spy on him through a window, the Creeper sneaks up on Jimmy and kills him. Meanwhile, at the police station, Captain M.J. Donelly (Donald MacBride) and Lieutenant Gates (Peter Whitney) receive complaints from the mayor's office about their failure to arrest the Creeper, but they deflect the blame. The two officers then get a call about the missing delivery boy and head to the dock to investigate.|$|E
25|$|Harris' {{store was}} the first in North Carolina to allow {{customers}} to select their own groceries off shelves. Before this time, customers handed a shopping list to a clerk, who then selected <b>the</b> <b>groceries</b> for the customers. The store was also open until 9p.m. on Fridays, {{at a time when most}} grocery stores closed their doors at 5p.m. This was done to appeal to working families and to capture their grocery shopping after they were paid on Fridays. Later, the Harris Super Market {{was the first}} grocery store in Charlotte to add air conditioning.|$|E

5000|$|... 1414 University Avenue (at Acton Street): Until {{the early}} 1960s, {{this was the}} only Co-op. It {{consisted}} of two buildings, one housing <b>the</b> <b>grocery,</b> <b>the</b> other a hardware store. For a time, <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> included a child care facility called the [...] "Kiddie Korral". <b>The</b> <b>grocery</b> was bought and operated by Andronico's until that chain went bankrupt in 2011. In November 2013, <b>the</b> old <b>grocery</b> re-opened as a non-grocery Savers Thrift Store. The adjacent building that was the site of the hardware store now houses several small businesses.|$|R

2500|$|Parcells {{left the}} Patriots after {{disagreements}} with owner Robert Kraft. He had effectively been the team's general manager since arriving in New England, but felt Kraft {{would not allow}} him enough input in player personnel decisions. Upon his departure, Parcells famously stated: [...] "They want you to cook the dinner; at least they ought to let you shop for some of <b>the</b> <b>groceries.</b> Okay?" [...] This was mainly in reference to an incident in the Patriots' war room during the 1996 Draft. Parcells wanted to draft DE Tony Brackens with their first-round choice, but was vetoed by Kraft. They ultimately selected Ohio State WR Terry Glenn.|$|E

60|$|Therefore it {{was that}} a pirate ship was a very welcome visitor in Charles Town harbor. She was {{generally}} loaded with goods, which, as they were stolen, her captain could afford to sell very cheaply indeed, and as there was always plenty of Spanish gold on board, her crew was not apt to haggle very much {{in regard to the}} price of the spirits, <b>the</b> <b>groceries,</b> or the provisions which they bought from the merchants of the town. This friendly commerce between the pirates and the Carolinians grew to be so extensive that at one time the larger part of the coin in circulation in those colonies consisted of Spanish gold pieces, which had been brought in and used by the pirates for the purchase of goods.|$|E
