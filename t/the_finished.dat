5|$|After writing Good Omens, Pratchett {{began to}} work with Larry Niven on a book that would become Rainbow Mars; Niven {{eventually}} completed the book on his own, but states in the afterword {{that a number of}} Pratchett's ideas remained in <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> version.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, {{although}} {{agriculture and}} the dairy industry, particularly the production of Leigh cheese, sometimes known as Leigh Toaster, were important, spinning and weaving began to develop as a cottage industry. Work was supplied from Manchester by agents who brought work weekly often to an inn, and where they collected <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> cloth. At first the work was done to supplement the income of local farmers and their families. The cloth woven in Leigh was fustian, a sort of rough corduroy, and by {{the end of the}} 17th century middlemen, fustian masters, were dealing directly with weavers and selling <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> cloth in Manchester.|$|E
5|$|In a {{preliminary}} study for The World Before the Flood {{now in the}} York Art Gallery, the broad structure {{is similar to that}} of <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> work, but the focus is more strongly on the central group of women. In Etty's oil sketch and in preliminary drawings the right-most of the dancing figures, wearing a green skirt, faces outward with her arms behind her back, forming a closed circle together with the central group of dancers. In <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> work, she gestures outwards from the circle, creating a clear narrative flow in the positions of the figures: from the single men on the left, to the man choosing a wife, to the group of dancing women, to the couple leaving the circle of dancers to join the reclining lovers on the far right.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{magnetic}} abrasive <b>finishing,</b> <b>the</b> {{development of}} a multiple pole-tip system using a partially heat-treated magnetic tool allows <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> of multiple regions simultaneously in capillary tubes and thus improves <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> efficiency. To further reduce the processing time required, a new high-speed machine is fabricated. This paper describes {{the development of the}} high-speed multiple pole-tip finishing equipment, which is capable of rotating the spindle up to 30000 min- 1, and the effects of tube rotational speed on abrasive motion during <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> experiments. Also, <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> mechanisms of <b>the</b> high-speed machine are clarified...|$|R
5|$|Shinkai was {{approached}} in early 2013 about adapting the material into a manga, {{which was then}} done by Midori Motohashi. In April, Shinkai stated {{that he was not}} contributing to the adaptation, leaving the work entirely to the manga artist. However, he did express interest in seeing <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> product.|$|E
5|$|Ted Hughes, the {{original}} story's author, died before the film's release. His daughter, Frieda Hughes, did see <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> film {{on his behalf}} and loved it. Pete Townshend, who this project originally started with, enjoyed the final film as well.|$|E

25|$|For <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>the</b> swimmer has {{to touch}} the wall with any body part, usually the hand. Most {{swimmers}} sprint <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> as quickly as possible, which usually includes reducing their breathing rate.|$|R
50|$|Two {{potential}} {{forms of}} cheating near <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> were dealt with using fencing at Marion Square at King Street (<b>the</b> <b>finish</b> festival site), and sponsor Bi-Lo parking a tractor-trailer {{at the intersection}} of Meeting and John to force runners to make the turn back to King. Furthermore, the live bands which play at <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> festival will be heard twice, as runners pass through Marion Square the first time on King Street, and after crossing <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line and cooling down.|$|R
2500|$|Rounding this mark {{puts them}} on a reach sprint to <b>the</b> <b>finish.</b> <b>The</b> fifth leg is around [...] in length. <b>The</b> <b>finish</b> line is {{right in front of}} America's Cup Park, at Piers 27/29.|$|R
5|$|The {{idea behind}} the shock therapy scene was based on Laurel and Hardy {{throwing}} pies at each other. The scene was rearranged in the editing room; it played out differently when first produced. The edits to this scene were preliminary, but well-received, and remained unchanged in <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> product.|$|E

5|$|While many reviews {{applauded the}} single-player campaign, the {{multiplayer}} mode bore {{the brunt of}} the game's criticism, with MacDonald, Speer and Miller all finding fault with it, describing it as lackluster and stating that the difference between the developer's vision for the game mode and <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> product made it difficult to enjoy.|$|E
50|$|This {{was another}} hilly stage, marked by three {{categorized}} climbs, including one 15 km from <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line. <b>The</b> <b>finish</b> again {{came on a}} descent.|$|R
500|$|The {{route of}} the 2016 Tour of the Basque Country was {{generally}} mountainous, with no stages suited for the sprinters. The first stage included eight categorised climbs, the last of which was [...] from <b>the</b> <b>finish.</b> <b>The</b> second <b>finished</b> with a [...] climb at an average gradient of 11.7%; {{the third and fourth}} stages again contained multiple climbs shortly before <b>the</b> <b>finish.</b> <b>The</b> fifth stage was the most difficult, with the [...] climb of the Arrate (referred to by its Basque name Usartza and averaging 8.5%), shortly before <b>the</b> <b>finish.</b> <b>The</b> final stage was a hilly individual time trial around Eibar.|$|R

5|$|A {{week before}} the game's release, it became known that an {{agreement}} to include EAX audio technology in Doom 3 reached by id Software and Creative Labs was heavily influenced by a software patent owned by the latter company. The patent dealt with a technique for rendering shadows called Carmack's Reverse, which was developed independently by both John Carmack and programmers at Creative Labs. id Software would have placed themselves under legal liability for using the technique in <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> game, so to defuse the issue, id Software agreed to license Creative Labs sound technologies in exchange for indemnification against lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|After the Hollywood {{theme was}} decided on, the design team {{drew up a}} map and {{assigned}} objects and puzzles to different areas. The game was originally designed for the ZX Spectrum and then ported to the Amstrad CPC, due to the systems' similar architecture. However, the team struggled to port the game to the Commodore 64 due to it being a different machine altogether. <b>The</b> <b>finished</b> game is significantly changed from the incomplete Movieland Dizzy, which featured only film sets as locations, the surrounding film studio and backlots were not present. The real-world studio elements were added after Dizzy was disassociated from the game.|$|E
5|$|Although Max Allan Collins (then a Dick Tracy comic-strip writer) had {{conflicts}} with Disney concerning the novelization, {{he gave a}} positive review for <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> film. He praised Beatty for hiring an elaborate design team and his decision to mimic the strip's limited color palette. Collins also enjoyed Beatty's performance, both the prosthetic makeup and characterization of the rogues gallery, {{as well as the}} Stephen Sondheim music. However, he believed the filmmakers still sacrificed the storyline in favor of the visual design.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> ninth stage <b>finished</b> in Monaco, {{where the}} riders would ride one extra lap, {{crossing}} <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line twice. When the first group, including Poulidor and Anquetil, reached <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line for <b>the</b> first time, Poulidor {{had forgotten the}} extra lap, and sprinted in avail for the victory. When the group reached <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line for <b>the</b> second time, Anquetil won the sprint, and one minute of bonification time.|$|R
500|$|The final climb of the {{day came}} with [...] remaining. This was the Côte de Saint-Nicolas ( [...] at 8.6%). Cycling Weekly {{described}} it as [...] "a succession of steep corners with nothing between". After the descent from the climb, the riders entered Ans, <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> town. There was a long, straight road that started [...] from <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line. After [...] of flat, the road climbed towards <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> at around 5%. With around [...] to go, there was a left-hand turn that took the riders to <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line.|$|R
50|$|The {{route of}} the 2016 Tour of the Basque Country was {{generally}} mountainous, with no stages suited for the sprinters. The first stage included eight categorised climbs, the last of which was 8.3 km from <b>the</b> <b>finish.</b> <b>The</b> second <b>finished</b> with a 2 km climb at an average gradient of 11.7%; {{the third and fourth}} stages again contained multiple climbs shortly before <b>the</b> <b>finish.</b> <b>The</b> fifth stage was the most difficult, with the 5.5 km climb of the Arrate (referred to by its Basque name Usartza and averaging 8.5%), shortly before <b>the</b> <b>finish.</b> <b>The</b> final stage was a hilly individual time trial around Eibar.|$|R
5|$|Another voice actor {{recruited}} was Mel Blanc, {{best remembered}} for voicing {{many of the}} characters in Warner Bros. cartoon shorts. Blanc was hired to perform the voice of Gideon the Cat. However, it was eventually decided that Gideon would be mute, so all of Blanc's recorded dialogue was subsequently deleted except for a solitary hiccup, which was heard three times in <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> film.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 50 {{people work}} {{together}} in animating and producing an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants. Throughout its run, production of the series has been handled domestically at Nickelodeon Animation Studio in Burbank, California, while <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> animation has been created overseas at Rough Draft Studios in South Korea. Storyboarding for each episode {{is done by the}} crew in California. The storyboards are then used as templates by the crew in Korea, who animate by hand, color cels on computers, and paint backgrounds. Episodes are finished in California, where they are edited and have music added. Every season, character designs are updated or modified to solve technical issues in the animation.|$|E
5|$|Around AD1100, natives {{established}} adze quarries {{high up on}} Mauna Kea {{to extract}} the uniquely dense basalt (generated by the quick cooling of lava flows meeting glacial ice during subglacial eruptions) to make tools. Volcanic glass and gabbro were collected for blades and fishing gear, and māmane wood was preferred for the handles. At peak quarry activity after AD1400, there were separate facilities for rough and fine cutting; shelters with food, water, and wood to sustain the workers; and workshops creating <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> product.|$|E

5|$|At {{the back}} of Why Johnny Can't Read, Flesch had {{included}} 72 lists of words that young children {{should be able to}} read, and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list. Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him with a list of 348 words that every six-year-old should know and insisted that the book's vocabulary be limited to 225 words. However, according to Philip Nel, Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969. He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> book contains 236 different words.|$|E
5|$|Balzac revised obsessively, {{covering}} printer's proofs {{with changes}} and additions to be reset. He sometimes repeated this process during {{the publication of}} a book, causing significant expense both for himself and the publisher. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> product quite often was different from the original text. Although some of his books never reached completion, some — such as Les employés (The Government Clerks, 1841) — are nonetheless noted by critics.|$|E
5|$|Before the film's {{worldwide}} release date, Pixar {{granted a}} wish from 10-year-old Colby Curtin {{to see the}} film before she died. Colby {{had been diagnosed with}} cancer and was too sick to go to a theater. A Pixar employee flew to the Curtins' house with a DVD of <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> film and screened it for her and her family. Curtin died seven hours later at 9:20 pm, shortly after seeing the film.|$|E
5|$|Beyond Two Rivers, {{the trail}} reaches the Chena River {{northwest}} of Fairbanks. This {{is the final}} stretch, and mushers use the river to enter Fairbanks and reach <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line, {{which is on the}} river itself in the middle of downtown Fairbanks. Regardless of the timing of <b>the</b> <b>finish,</b> several thousand spectators typically gather to watch the first musher cross <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was about}} this time that reports came through of a problem at <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line - a bus for the [...] team had become stuck under <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> arch. It was too tall to pass through. It {{disrupted}} the electronic timing for the stage, but the more pressing problem {{was the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line was not clear to be covered by the cyclists. Race officials tried to extricate the bus, having no success for several minutes as the riders came nearer and nearer to <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line. As <b>the</b> peloton passed through the 10 km to go mark, the decision was sent out over race radio for <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line to be moved to the banner representing 3 km to <b>the</b> (original) <b>finish</b> line. Around this same time, the day's first major crash occurred, sending, among numerous others, 2012 Giro d'Italia champion Ryder Hesjedal off his bicycle. At approximately 6 km to go <b>the</b> original <b>finish,</b> meaning 3 km to go <b>the</b> revised <b>finish</b> line, teams such as [...] and [...] had begun their leadouts.|$|R
