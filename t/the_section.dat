5|$|Lodges {{are grouped}} into {{sections}} that are then grouped into regions. <b>The</b> <b>section</b> chief is the elected youth leader, a volunteer adult is appointed as <b>the</b> <b>section</b> adviser, {{and the area}} director (or his designate) is the professional (staff) adviser.

5|$|According to Takahashi, the inamyloid spores, the diverticulate cap cuticle hyphae, and {{the dark}} pigment in the gill hyphae suggest that the fungus is best {{classified}} in <b>the</b> <b>section</b> Hiemales of the genus Mycena. Because of its medium-sized, partly collybioid fruit bodies (i.e., small to medium-sized with white spore prints and convex caps, similar to species once placed in the genus Collybia), the white cord-like rhizomorphs, and its distinctly intervenose gills, it has an isolated position within <b>the</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{initially}} envisioned, the Hanlon Expressway will be {{upgraded to}} a controlled-access highway by removing all existing at-grade intersections {{and improving the}} highway to 400-series standards.

The EA for <b>the</b> <b>section</b> south of the Speed River began in early 2007.

5|$|By 2005, {{ridership}} {{had increased}} to 2.5 million per year, up 278% from 1991, giving a 7% {{market share in}} the corridor. To further increase capacity and regularity, the Norwegian National Rail Administration decided to rebuild <b>the</b> <b>section</b> from Stavanger to Sandnes to double track. At the same time, a new freight terminal was to be built at Ganddal, meaning that <b>the</b> <b>section</b> would only have to be shared with intercity trains. The upgrade involved closing Hillevåg Station, and building three new stations: Paradis, Jåttåvågen and Gausel. Construction was started in 2006 and {{was estimated to be}} completed by 2009. It was estimated to cost 2.2 billion Norwegian krone. From April to November 2009, <b>the</b> <b>section</b> from Ganddal to Stavanger was closed while {{the last part of the}} upgrade was completed. The new line was opened on 16 November 2009 and from 14 December, the 15-minute headway was introduced between Stavanger and Sandnes.|$|E

5|$|The Government {{argued that}} <b>the</b> <b>sections</b> of <b>the</b> Act dealing with disputation by {{petition}} encompassed {{any question about}} the validity of an election, including the eligibility of a candidate, and that <b>the</b> <b>sections</b> should be interpreted broadly. Sue made a similar argument, saying that <b>the</b> <b>sections</b> allowing disputes by petition and <b>the</b> <b>sections</b> allowing disputes by the relevant house of Parliament were not mutually exclusive and that elections could be disputed by either the Parliament or the people.|$|R

5|$|Construction of {{the portion}} of the highway between the eastern {{terminus}} and the Muskogee Turnpike, known as the Broken Arrow south loop, was scheduled to begin in May 1999 and be completed in January 2001. <b>The</b> <b>section</b> from the Muskogee Turnpike north to the Will Rogers Turnpike was to begin construction in September 1999 and be completed in January 2002. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>section</b> of the turnpike built in the early 1990s, this section was expected to displace few residents; the city of Broken Arrow had purchased much of the right-of-way ahead of time to preserve the corridor for the expected turnpike.|$|E

5|$|From West Main Street to South Avenue, {{the bridge}} {{supports}} were largely built with concrete while the supports on <b>the</b> <b>section</b> between Brown Street and West Main Street were mostly built with steel.
