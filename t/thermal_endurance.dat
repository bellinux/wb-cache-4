40|$|The {{current-carrying}} cores of {{the electrical}} power cables should be resistant to effects of short-circuit currents whose values {{depend on the}} material of the core, its cross-sectional area, cable insulation properties, environment temperature, and {{the duration of the}} short-circuit current flow (1 and 3 – 4 sec. when tested for <b>thermal</b> <b>endurance</b> and mechanical bracing). The facilities for testing the 10 kV aluminum core cables with short-circuit current shall provide mechanical-bracing current 56, 82 kA and <b>thermal</b> <b>endurance</b> current 11, 16 kA. Although capacitors provide such values of the testing currents to the best advantage, utilizing conventional capacitor-units will involve large expenditures for erecting and  running a separate building. It is expedient to apply super-capacitors qua the electric power supply for testing facilities, as they are capacitors with double-electrical layer and involve the current values of tens of kilo-amperes. The insulation voltage during short-circuit current testing being not-standardized, it is not banned to apply voltages less than 10 kV when performing short-circuit <b>thermal</b> <b>endurance</b> and mechanical bracing tests for electrical power cables of 10 kV. The super-capacitor voltage variation-in-time graph consists of two regions: capacitive and resistive. The capacitive part corresponds to the voltage change consequent on the energy change in the super-capacitors. The resistive part shows the voltage variation due to the active resistance presence in the super-capacitor. The author offers the algorithm determining the number of super capacitors requisite for testing 10 kV-electrical power cables with short-circuit currents for <b>thermal</b> <b>endurance</b> and mechanical bracing. The paper shows that installation of super-capacitors in the facilities testing the cables with short-circuit currents reduces the area needed for the super-capacitors in comparison with conventional capacitors more than by one order of magnitude. </p...|$|E

To identify the mechanism of anatomical adjustment under high temperature, three Rhododendron species with different sensitivity to high temperature stress were selected to investigate the effect of heat stress on the anatomical structure. Heat stress resulted in stomatal closure and the decrease of stomatal density, however, the limited stomatal adjustment reached by R. fortune and R. mariesii may not prevent water loss effectively, of which the leaf thickness was reduced and obvious plasmolysis was observed in the mesophyll cells. R. simsii with smaller stomata and higher stomatal density had greater heat resistance than R. fortune and R. mariesii. Heat stress injured cell membrane structure seriously, and {{it was found that}} the nuclear membrane was digested and the nucleolus disappeared. The response of chloroplasts to high temperature was most sensitive, in which thylakoid lamellas became blurred, even degraded in heat–sensitive Rhododendron species.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the premise that ceramics might sometimes profitably be shaped using techniques more traditionally associated with metals and plastics, particularly forging of solids and extrusion of liquids. This firstly required that the high temperature formability of ceramics be known. Existing forming and associated testing techniques were therefore surveyed, establishing short-comings and pointing to areas requiring new techniques. Plastic deformation mechanisms of principal simple ceramics were reviewed to determine the scope of novel techniques required, and to show evidence of suitability for forming. Emphasis {{was given to the}} deformation behaviour of alumina, the ceramic chosen for experimental investigation. Five rigs were constructed for an experimental schedule in three phases: (I) two furnaces and one press were used to study the compatibility of alumina with graphite, tantalum, tungsten and molybdenum under forming conditions. Some original microhardness values for carbides were measured. Observations were made of graphite's spectral emissivity. Sensitive temperature control was achieved. ii) a special melting unit was developed for inflating molten alumina to form hollow spheres, resembling blow-moulding of glass and plastics. <b>Thermal</b> <b>endurances</b> of tungsten heaters in vacuo, in argon and in molten alumina were studied. Heat transfer through sintered and powder alumina was measured. The spectral emissivity of sintered alumina was found. The freezing contraction of molten alumina, and the contact angle with tungsten were found accurately using a novel technique with possible wide application. iii) a multipurpose rig with tungsten tooling was constructed for tests of alternating drivedown - stress relaxation, compressive creep, and forging on recrystallised alumina. The experiments gave information on forgeability, ductility above 1150 C, crack healing, tertiary creep rate, pore distribution effect on steady state creep rate, and pore closing contribution to deformation.

Here, we investigated <b>thermal</b> constraints on <b>endurance</b> rivalry in fiddler crabs, a group well suited for studies of interactions between sexual and natural selection due to ritualized mating behaviors and extreme sexual dimorphism. Fiddler crab males display in thermally stressful high-intertidal breeding areas. Retreating into burrows, an effective thermoregulatory mechanism, requires a cessation of courtship behaviors. We predicted that males should {{spend more time on}} the surface than females and that their ability to do so should decrease with increasing body temperature. In contrast, the amount of time females spend on the surface should be little affected by body temperature. We tested these predictions in the fiddler crab Uca panacea by manipulating body temperatures and monitoring surface activity and habitat choice in large outdoor tanks during the breeding season. Males showed consistently higher surface activity than females. Effects of body temperature on surface activity were sex-specific, occurring in males but not in females, indicating sex-specific thermal constraints on surface behavior and supporting our hypothesized <b>thermal</b> constraints on <b>endurance</b> rivalry.

40|$|We {{survey the}} current state of phase change memory (PCM), a {{non-volatile}} solid-state memory technology built around the large electrical contrast between the highly-resistive amorphous and highly-conductive crystalline states in so-called phase change materials. PCM technology has made rapid progress in a short time, having passed older technologies in terms of both sophisticated demonstrations of scaling to small device dimensions, as well as integrated large-array demonstrators with impressive retention, endurance, performance and yield characteristics. We introduce the physics behind PCM technology, assess how its characteristics match up with various potential applications across the memory-storage hierarchy, and discuss its strengths including scalability and rapid switching speed. We then address challenges for the technology, including the design of PCM cells for low RESET current, the need to control device-to-device variability, and undesirable changes in the phase change material that can be induced by the fabrication procedure. We then turn to issues related to operation of PCM devices, including retention, device-to-device <b>thermal</b> crosstalk, <b>endurance,</b> and bias-polarity effects.

Thermal fatigue tests {{were carried out}} using a special induction heating apparatus, which consisted of induction heating and water spray cooling unit. The process of thermal cycling was simulated using a coupled heat-transfer solid-mechanics finite element model. It was seen that the thermal fatigue resistance was higher in the gas nitrided samples after austenizing at 1020 degrees C than for the gas nitrided samples after austenizing at 1100 degrees C.

It was also found that, lower the ratio of compound layer thickness to the total diffusion depth, the higher is the fatigue life. These results were influenced by two major effects of nitrided (diffusion) layer. First is the high compressive residual stresses imparted on the surface which tend to mitigate the effect of thermal tensile stress and secondly very high surface hardness, due to the diffusion of nitrogen, which increase the threshold for crack initiation at the surface.

The three thermal barrier coatings refined under this program are zirconia stabilized with twenty-one percent magnesia (21 % MSZ), six percent yttria (6 % YSZ), and twenty percent yttria (20 % YSZ). Improvement in <b>thermal</b> cyclic <b>endurance</b> by a factor of 40 times was demonstrated in rig tests.

An RF-compensated Langmuir probe was used to characterize and compare the plasmas in mirrored balanced and closed-field unbalanced magnetron configurations. The spatial distributions of the electron density ne and electron temperature Te were measured. The density profiles reflect the shapes of the plasma. Rather than intensively concentrated to the targets/cathodes in the balanced magnetrons, the plasma is more dispersive in the closed-field mode with a twice higher electron density in the substrate region. The RF assistance significantly enhances ne by one or two orders of magnitude higher. The effect of various other parameters, such as pressure, on the plasma was also studied. The ionization fractions of the sputtered atoms were measured using a gridded energy analyzer (GEA) combined with a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The presence of the RF plasma effectively increases the ITO ionization fraction to around 80 % in both the balanced and closed-field unbalanced configurations. The ionization fraction also varies with pressure, maximizing at 5 - 10 mTorr. The study of the ionization not only facilitates understanding the plasma behaviors in the RF-assisted magnetron sputtering, but also provides a criterion for optimizing the film deposition process. ITO films were deposited on both glass and plastic (PET) substrates in the 3 -inch RF-assisted closed-field magnetrons. The electrical resistivity and optical transmission transparency of the ITO films were measured. Appropriate RF assistance was shown to dramatically reduce the electrical resistivity. An ITO film with a resistivity of 1. 2 × 10 - 3 Ω-cm and a visible light transmittance of 91 % was obtained with a 225 W RF enhancement, while the substrate temperature was monitored as below 110 °C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to confirm the ITO film stoichiometry. The surface morphology of the ITO films and its effect on the film properties were studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The prototype of RF-assisted closed-field magnetron was further extended to a larger rectangular shaped dual magnetron in a flat panel display manufacturing system.

A cube corner indenter provided the fastest indication of failure, through crack formation, compared to a spherical indenter. Contact fatigue was performed on sintered hydroxyapatite and then on splats produced on titanium, stainless steel and cobalt-chrome surfaces, either made on room temperature or 250 oC preheated surfaces. Sintered hydroxyapatite showed continual plastic deformation, {{but this is not}} that apparent for splats on metal surfaces.

40|$|Abstract Low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) based system-in-package (SiP) is an {{emerging}} multilayer module technology for wireless communication applications, mainly {{due to its}} excellent high-frequency material properties. LTCC-SiP modules are typically soldered onto an organic motherboard, but the lifetime of the 2 nd-level solder joints is often poor due to the high stress level of the joints in test/field conditions. Moreover, using lead-free solders in the interconnections of LTCC modules raised new questions about the feasibility and reliability of the solder joints in LTCC applications. Therefore, the characteristic features of the 2 nd-level solder joint configuration were determined in this thesis work. It was proved that collapsible Sn 4 Ag 0. 5 Cu spheres are not a feasible option in LTCC/PWB assemblies with a large global thermal mismatch; a non-collapsible ball grid array (BGA) joint with a plastic core solder balls (PCSBs) was required to attain an adequate lifetime for such assemblies. To enhance the <b>thermal</b> fatigue <b>endurance</b> of the non-collapsible lead-free joints, a novel BGA joint consisting of Sn 7 In 4. 1 Ag 0. 5 Cu solder and PCSBs was developed. Moreover, this work proved {{that there is a}} relationship between the primary failure mechanisms of various Sn-based lead-free solders and thermomechanically induced stress level in the present non-collapsible BGA joint configuration. The effect of the plating material of the solder lands on the failure mechanism of the BGA joints in the LTCC/PWB assemblies was studied. The results showed that the adverse phenomena related to the sintered Ag-based metallization materials can be avoided using electroless nickel with immersion gold (ENIG) as a deposit material. On the other hand, this study also demonstrated that the inadequate adhesion strength of the commercial base metallization in the ENIG-plated modules resulted in the disadvantageous failure mechanism of the test assemblies.

40|$|Wood in Siberia is a {{building}} material given by God. So much craftsmanship and folk art {{have been developed}} in it through the a ges. Professional architec t s also show interest in wood. But wood can be burnt. After the fire in 1879, wh e n the major part of Irkutsk burnt down, one had to give preference to brick, at least, on the central streets of the city. However, Irkutsk is still more attractive with its wood than with the successful use of other building materials. And not only Irkutsk, I dare to say. Plentiful timber resources do not teach the users to treat the wood economically nowadays. Wasteless industry is in its first stages, furniture produ c tion and joinery are developing at the very Least. Glued constructions, energy efficient architectural and building systems {{with the use of}} wooden frames are replaced by the arguments that a log makes a wonderful architectural e ffect and it is so much Russian. And it is not considered important that, according to the Russian current standards of <b>thermal</b> <b>endurance,</b> the outside walls should be two logs thick. These are th e words of Irkutsk provincial writer Valentin Rasputin speaking about wood as {{a building}} material : «Wood has a rare ability to prolong our memory as far as the depths and events we could never witness. Better to say - it is a n a bility to convey to us the memory of our ancestors. Stone is colder and ~ more immovable; wood is compliant and returns the feeling». Wood keeps one's soul warm, but does not keep the warmth inside the house. Or, rather, it does not keep the warmth as much as the other mor e efficient constructions and materials do. We do not say farewell t o wood. We say : Let's protect the forests. The subject of the issue is a bout all these and other things. </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Aerospace Engineering Department (DIAS) at Federico II University of Naples aiming to evaluate the feasibility {{and the performance of}} an electrically heated composite leading edge for anti-icing and de-icing applications. A 283 [mm] chord NACA 0012 airfoil prototype was designed, manufactured and equipped with an High Temperature composite leading edge with embedded Ni-Cr heating element. The heating element was fed by a DC power supply unit and the average power densities supplied to the leading edge were ranging 1. 0 to 30. 0 [kW m- 2]. The present investigation focused on thermal tests experimentally performed under fixed icing conditions with zero AOA, Mach= 0. 2, total temperature of - 20 [°C], liquid water content LWC= 0. 6 [g m- 3] and average mean volume droplet diameter MVD= 35 [µm]. These fixed conditions represented the top icing performance of the Icing Flow Facility (IFF) available at DIAS and therefore it has represented the “sizing design case” for the tested prototype. An analytical model has been also developed both for the preliminary sizing and test guidance. Running wet and fully evaporative functional modes have been verified both analytically and experimentally with reasonable agreement. A room temperature <b>thermal</b> <b>endurance</b> test has been run for 104 cycles with max thermal load representative of 1. 5 times the max temperature experienced within the leading edge in fully evaporative conditions aiming to verify the integrity of the composite laminate after the imposed thermal stress through micrographic inspection. The achieved results, despite obtained under limited icing conditions imposed by the IFF wind tunnel, showed great potentialities for the proposed Icing Protection System named EHCLE (Electrical Heated Composite Leading Edge) which has been constantly working below 60 % of its maximum operative temperatures under the given icing conditions and the explored power densities. This potentiality justify the need for future development in a larger scale under more severe icing condition for a final assessment about the applicability of such Icing Protection System to real aircrafts...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryX. Susan SunPoly(lactic acid) (PLA), a {{synthetic}} biopolymer, is a promising substitute of some petroleum-based polymers {{due to its}} mechanical and biodegradable properties. But, {{because of the high}} cost of PLA (compared to those petroleum plastics for disposable application), starch has been incorporated into PLA to reduce cost and accelerate the biodegradability rate of the composites. But, the addition of starch as filler to PLA decreased mechanical performance of the composite. The addition of methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) into PLA/starch blends improved drastically the mechanical properties of the composite. Results from thermal-degradation analysis showed that PLA had the highest Arrhenius activation energy and strongest <b>thermal</b> <b>endurance</b> of all samples, followed by PLA/starch/MDI and PLA/starch. Aged samples exposed to fluctuating humidity storage conditions significantly decreased their performance. But, storing the samples in plastic bags could minimize degradation of properties. PLA and its composites with starch would not significantly affect application function when they are stored in controlled environment. PLA and PLA/starch based composites sealed in plastic bags can be stored in fluctuating humidity conditions (30 - 90 % RH) for up to 30 days. Tensile strength, elongation, and damping increased with average particle size of starch granules (APS). But, declination of these properties was detected with APS larger than 45 mm. Crystallinity increased as the APS decreased. Young’s modulus, storage modulus, and moisture absorption were not significantly affected by the starch APS. The use of MDI as a coupling agent altered the role of starch APS on those properties of poly(lactic acid) /starch composite. The oxidation of the primary alcohol group on C 6 of starch molecules up to 10 % degree of substitution did not significantly affect the mechanical properties of PLA/starch/MDI, but the composites showed a reduced inelastic deformation (tensile curve) and significant increase in storage modulus and damping. Results suggest that a substitution of hydroxyl group on C 6 of starch molecules for carboxyl group (up to 10 %) increased the strengthening effect of MDI enough to reduce inelastic deformation of the composites upon load, but not enough to enhance mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effects of a cooling {{strategy}} designed to predominately lower thermal state with a strategy designed to lower <b>thermal</b> sensation on <b>endurance</b> running performance and physiology in the heat. Eleven moderately trained male runners completed familiarization and three randomized, crossover 5 -km running time trials on a non-motorized treadmill in hot conditions (33 [*]°C). The trials included ice slurry ingestion before exercise (ICE), menthol mouth rinse during exercise (MEN), and no intervention (CON). Running performance was significantly improved with MEN (25. 3 [*]±[*] 3. 5 [*]min; P[*]=[*] 0. 01), but not ICE (26. 3 [*]±[*] 3. 2 [*]min; P[*]=[*] 0. 45) when compared with CON (26. 0 [*]±[*] 3. 4 [*]min). Rectal temperature was significantly decreased with ICE (by 0. 3 [*]±[*] 0. 2 [*]°C; P[*] 3 ̆c[*] 0. 01), which persisted for 2 [*]km of the run and MEN significantly decreased perceived thermal sensation (between 4 and 5 [*]km) and ventilation (between 1 and 2 [*]km) during the time trial. End-exercise blood prolactin concentration was elevated with MEN compared with CON (by 25. 1 [*]±[*] 24. 4 [*]ng/mL; P[*]=[*] 0. 02). The data demonstrate that a change in the perception of thermal sensation during exercise from menthol mouth rinse was associated with improved endurance running performance in the heat. Ice slurry ingestion reduced core temperature but did not decrease thermal sensation during exercise or improve running performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{rapid growth}} in the {{wireless}} communications markets together with the emerging need for high-bit-rate (≫ 100 Mb/s) multimedia/data services are pushing the usage of radio spectrum resources below 10 GHz to the uttermost limit. The lack of bandwidth {{has led to an}} extensive development of mobile/fixed BWA systems for the higher microwave and millimetre-wave regions up to the V-band frequencies (50 – 75 GHz). In order for these systems to have mass deployment and to meet cost-sensitive consumer markets’ requirements, their cost and size must be reduced from current levels. One of the most viable packaging approaches to satisfy these demands is the low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) based system-in-package (SiP) module technology combined with fully automated surface-mount assembly techniques. However, one of the main challenges of this approach has been previously associated with the broadband radio frequency (RF) and reliability performance constraints of the board-level solder joints in LTCC/PCB assemblies. In this thesis the primary focus is to tackle these limitations and significantly extend the feasibility of the LTCC module technology to various wireless/mixed-signal packaging applications. The thesis is divided into three main parts. In the first part, design, modelling and implementation of vertical package transitions (BGA, flip-chip, substrate via) over a very wide frequency range are presented. In the second part, the emphasis is on the improvement of the <b>thermal</b> fatigue <b>endurance</b> of the board-level solder joints in the LTCC/PCB assemblies. In the last part, the results are merged to realize a high-performance LTCC module platform for use {{in a wide variety of}} SiP products in the telecommunication sector. The flip-chip, substrate-via and BGA transition structures exhibited excellent signal transmission properties up to the V-band frequencies. The developed equivalent circuit models of the transitions matched well with the measurements. Cascading the transitions together allows the building of different combinations of vertical interconnection paths in SiP modules. To demonstrate this, a surface-mountable LTCC filter package for K-band radio link frequencies was implemented. The developed composite BGA solder joint structure with plastic-core solder balls significantly enhanced the thermal fatigue life in LTCC/PCB assemblies in different thermal cycling conditions, indicating adequate board-level reliability for many practical LTCC-BGA packaging applications. Moreover, electromagnetic analysis showed that the use of the plastic-core solder ball has no detrimental impact on the RF performance of the solder joint. Finally, based on the obtained results a reliable lead-free LTCC-BGA module platform was developed for broadband packaging applications. The BGA module platform with a size of 15  mm ×  15  mm included 38 low-frequency and two wideband RF input/output connections up to the K-band frequencies. The module structure also allowed plenty of space to mount discrete SMD/bare-die components on the surface and/or to embed passive components in the 1. 2 mm thick substrate. Preliminary thermal cycling results of the soldered LTCC/PCB assemblies demonstrated sufficient reliability for telecommunication applications. Therefore, the presented module platform can serve as a physical building block for various wireless/mixed-signal SiP products, and hence significantly reduce their development time and associated costs...|$|R

Whether nonpharmacological thermal therapies promote the endurance of loaded inspiratory muscles in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is unclear. The objectives of this study were to compare the effects of two <b>thermal</b> interventions on <b>endurance</b> time (ET) and plasma IL- 6 concentration following an IRB challenge. Methods: This study was a randomized, parallel-group, unblinded clinical trial in a single-center setting. Forty-two patients (aged 42 – 76  years) suffering from mild to severe COPD participated in this study. Both groups completed 12 sessions of the mud bath therapy (MBT) (n= 22) or leisure thermal activity (LTA) (n= 19) in a thermal spa center in Italy. Pre- and postintervention spirometry, maximum inspiratory pressure, and plasma mediators were obtained and ET and endurance oxygen expenditure (VO 2 Endur) were measured following IRB challenge at 40 % of maximum inspiratory pressure. Results: There was no difference in ΔIL- 6 between the intervention groups. But, IRB challenge increased cytokine IL- 6 plasma levels systematically. The effect size was small. A statistically significant treatment by IRB challenge effect existed in ET, which significantly increased in the MBT group (P= 0. 003). In analysis of covariance treatment by IRB challenge analysis with LnVO 2 Endur as the dependent variable, ΔIL- 6 after intervention predicted LnVO 2 Endur in the MBT group, but not in the LTA group. Adverse events occurred in two individuals in the MBT group, but they were mainly transient. One patient in the LTA group dropped out. Conclusion: MBT model improves ET upon a moderate IRB challenge, indicating the occurrence of a training effect. The LnVO 2 Endur/ΔIL- 6 suggests a physiologic adaptive mechanism in respiratory muscles of COPD patients allocated to treatment. Both thermal interventions are safe.
