5|$|<b>Tamazight</b> is in {{the middle}} of a dialect {{continuum}} between Riff to its north-east and Shilha to its south-west. The basic lexicon of <b>Tamazight</b> differs markedly from Shilha, and its verbal system is more similar to Riff or Kabyle. Moreover, <b>Tamazight</b> has a greater amount of internal diversity than Shilha.|$|E
5|$|After Morocco's {{independence}} in 1956, {{a strong emphasis}} was laid on the country's Arab identity, and a national Arabic language educational system was instituted, in which Berber languages, including Middle Atlas <b>Tamazight,</b> had no place. However, in 1994 the government responded to Berber demands for recognition by decreeing that Berber should be taught and establishing television broadcasts in three Berber languages, including Central Atlas <b>Tamazight.</b> For the promotion of <b>Tamazight</b> and other Berber languages and cultures, the government created the Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture (IRCAM) in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Central Atlas <b>Tamazight</b> {{is one of}} {{the four}} most-spoken Berber languages, in {{addition}} to Kabyle, Shilha, and Riff, and rivals Shilha as the most-spoken Berber language in Morocco. Differentiating these dialects is {{complicated by the fact that}} speakers of other languages may also refer to their language as 'Tamazight'. The differences between all three groups are largely phonological and lexical, rather than syntactic. <b>Tamazight</b> itself has a relatively large degree of internal diversity, including whether spirantization occurs.|$|E

500|$|... wh- {{questions}} are always clefts, and multiple wh-questions do not occur. Consequently, <b>Tamazight's</b> clefting, relativisation, and wh-interrogation contribute to anti-agreement effects, similar to Shilha, and causes deletion of the verbal person marker in certain situations.|$|R
5|$|<b>Tamazight</b> in {{fact has}} {{numerous}} words without phonemic vowels, and those consisting entirely of voiceless consonants will not phonetically contain voiced vowels.|$|E
5|$|Central Atlas <b>Tamazight</b> grammar {{has many}} {{features}} typical of Afro-Asiatic languages, including extensive apophony {{in both the}} derivational and inflectional morphology, gender, possessive suffixes, VSO typology, the causative morpheme /s/, {{and use of the}} status constructus.|$|E
5|$|Central Atlas <b>Tamazight</b> {{is among}} the four most-spoken Berber {{languages}} (the other three being Kabyle, Shilha, and Riff), and rivals Shilha as the most-spoken Berber language in Morocco. Central Atlas <b>Tamazight</b> is mostly spoken in the entire Middle Atlas and its outcroppings, reaching east to Taza and west to the region near Rabat. It is also spoken in the central and eastern High Atlas mountains in Morocco. It is thus spoken across areas with widely varying ecological conditions — from the mountainous and forested regions of the Middle Atlas mountains to the oases of the northwestern Sahara (Tafilalt). Berber in Morocco is spread into three areas: Riff in the north, Central Atlas in the center, and Shilha in the south/southwest. Central Atlas is not mutually intelligible with the Riff language but is with the Shilha dialect; Shilha- and Riff-speakers also cannot understand each other, That said, the Riffian language is of course related to both Shilha and Atlas <b>Tamazight,</b> and even though Riffian {{and the other two}} are not mutually intelligible, they share a high degree of the same vocabulary and grammar.|$|E
5|$|Central Atlas <b>Tamazight's</b> {{personal}} pronouns distinguish three persons, and two genders. Pronouns {{appear in}} three forms: an independent form {{used in the}} subject position, a possessive suffix (and a derived independent possessive pronoun), and an object form affixed to the controlling verb.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tamazight's</b> clefting, relativisation, and wh-interrogation cause what {{is called}} [...] "anti-agreement effects", {{similarly}} to Shilha. This is when the verb doesn't agree with or agrees in a special way with wh-words. In Berber, the feminine singular prefix [...] disappears when the subject is a wh- phrase, but only for affirmative verbs.|$|R
5000|$|For the {{historian}} Abraham Isaac Laredo the name Amazigh could {{be derived from}} {{the name of the}} ancestor Mezeg which is the translation of biblical ancestor Dedan son of Sheba in the Targum. According to Leo Africanus, Amazigh meant [...] "free man", though this has been disputed, because there is no root of M-Z-Gh meaning [...] "free" [...] in modern Berber languages. This dispute, however, is based on a lack of understanding of the Berber language as [...] "Am-" [...] is a prefix meaning [...] "a man, one who is …" [...] Therefore, the root required to verify this endonym would be (a)zigh, [...] "free", which however is also missing from <b>Tamazight's</b> lexicon, but {{may be related to the}} well attested aze [...] "strong", Tizzit [...] "bravery", or jeghegh [...] "to be brave, to be courageous".|$|R
5|$|Central Atlas <b>Tamazight</b> verbs {{are heavily}} inflected, being marked for tense, aspect, mode, voice, person, and polarity. <b>Tamazight</b> verbs have at their core a stem, {{modified}} by prefixes, suffixes, moveable affixes, circumfixes, and ablaut. The prefixes indicate voice, tense, aspect, and polarity, while the suffixes indicate mood (normal, horatory, or imperative). Subject markers are circumfixed to the verb, while object marking and satellite framing are accomplished via either prefixing or suffixing depending on environment Some verb forms {{are accompanied by}} ablaut, and sometimes metathesis.|$|E
5|$|Groups {{speaking}} <b>Tamazight</b> include: Ait Ayache, Ait Morghi, Ait Alaham, Ait Youb, Marmoucha, Ait Youssi, Beni Mguild, Zayane, Zemmour, Ait Rbaa, Ait Seri, Guerouane, Ait Segougou, Ait Yafelman, Ait Sikhmane, Ayt Ndhir (Beni Mtir).|$|E
5|$|Central Atlas <b>Tamazight</b> (unlike {{neighbouring}} Tashelhit) had {{no known}} significant writing tradition until the 20th century. It is now officially {{written in the}} Tifinagh script for instruction in Moroccan schools, while descriptive linguistic literature commonly uses the Latin alphabet, and the Arabic alphabet has also been used.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tamazight,</b> {{along with}} other Berber {{languages}} of Morocco, has a low sociolinguistic status, used mainly in the home, and rarely in official or formal contexts; {{it is not an}} official language. However, media broadcasts and music are available in it, and there is a policy of teaching it in schools.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{relatively}} intense language contact, Central Atlas <b>Tamazight</b> has a large stratum of Arabic loans. Many borrowed words in Berber also have native synonyms, e.g. /lbab/ or /tiflut/ 'door', the latter used more in rural areas. The contact was unequal, as Moroccan Arabic has not borrowed as much from Berber languages, though Berber has contributed to Moroccan and Algerian Arabics' very reduced vowel systems.|$|E
25|$|Spain: <b>Tamazight</b> {{is spoken}} amongst Melilla's 80,000 inhabitants, {{but there has}} been no census as to the {{percentage}} of its speakers. A minority of Ceuta's inhabitants speak Berber.|$|E
25|$|The Tifinagh {{alphabet}} {{is still}} actively used {{to varying degrees}} in trade and modernized forms for writing of Berber languages (<b>Tamazight,</b> Tamashek, etc.) of the Maghreb, Sahara, and Sahel regions (Savage 2008).|$|E
25|$|On 30 April 2012 Fatima Chahou, alias Tabaamrant, {{member of}} the Moroccan House of Representatives and former singer became {{the first person to}} ask {{questions}} and discuss the minister's answer in <b>Tamazight</b> inside the Parliament of Morocco.|$|E
25|$|Many Arabic {{speaking}} Libyans {{consider themselves}} {{as part of}} a wider Arab community. This was strengthened by the spread of Pan-Arabism in the mid-20th century, and their reach to power in Libya where they instituted Arabic as the only official language of the state. Under their dictatorship the teaching and even use of indigenous <b>Tamazight</b> language was strictly forbidden. In addition to banning foreign languages previously taught in academic institutions, leaving entire generations of Libyans with limitations in their comprehension of the English language. Both the spoken Arabic dialects and <b>Tamazight,</b> still retain words from Italian, that were acquired before and during the Libia Italiana period.|$|E
25|$|As {{areas of}} Libya {{south and west}} of Tripoli such as the Nafusa Mountains {{were taken from the}} control of Gaddafi {{government}} forces in early summer 2011, Berber workshops and exhibitions sprang up to share and spread the <b>Tamazight</b> culture and language.|$|E
25|$|Although {{regional}} councils in Libya's Nafusa Mountains {{affiliated with}} the National Transitional Council reportedly use the Berber language of Nafusi and have called {{for it to be}} granted co-official status with Arabic in a prospective new constitution, Algeria and Morocco are the only countries where <b>Tamazight</b> is an official language.|$|E
25|$|Other Berber {{languages}} {{spoken in}} Algeria include: the <b>Tamazight</b> of Blida, {{the languages of}} the Beni Snouss and Beni Boussaid villages {{in the province of}} Tlemcen, the Matmata Berber spoken in the Ouarsenis region, the Mozabite language spoken in the region of the province of Mzab and the language of the Ouargla oasis.|$|E
25|$|There exists no sharply defined {{boundary}} between Shilha dialects and the dialects of Central Atlas <b>Tamazight</b> (CAT). The dividing line is generally put {{somewhere along the}} line Marrakesh-Zagora, with the speech of the Ighoujdamen, Iglioua and Aït Ouaouzguite ethnic groups belonging to Shilha, and that of the neighboring Inoultan, Infedouak and Imeghran ethnic groups counted as CAT.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} of Moroccan Berber languages into three groups, as used by Ethnologue, {{is common in}} linguistic publications, but is significantly complicated {{by the presence of}} local differences: Shilha is subdivided into Shilha of the Draa River valley, Tasusit (the language of the Souss) and several other mountain languages. Moreover, linguistic boundaries are blurred, such that certain languages cannot accurately be described as either Central Morocco <b>Tamazight</b> (spoken in the central and eastern Atlas area) or Shilha.|$|E
25|$|In {{the north}} and to the south, Shilha borders on Arabic-speaking areas. In the northeast, roughly along the line Marrakesh-Zagora, there is a dialect {{continuum}} with Central Atlas <b>Tamazight.</b> Within the Shilha area, there are several Arabic-speaking enclaves, notably the town of Taroudant and its surroundings. Substantial Shilha-speaking migrant communities are found {{in most of the}} larger towns and cities of northern Morocco, and outside Morocco in Belgium, France, Germany, Canada, the United States, and Israel.|$|E
25|$|The next {{author to}} grapple with Shilha is Saïd Cid Kaoui (Saʿīd al-Sidqāwī, 1859-1910), a native speaker of Kabyle from Algeria. Having {{published}} a dictionary of Tuareg (1894), he then {{turned his attention to}} the Berber languages of Morocco. His Dictionnaire français-tachelh'it et tamazir't (1907) contains extensive vocabularies in both Shilha and Central Atlas <b>Tamazight,</b> in addition to some 20 pages of useful phrases. The work seems to have been put together in some haste and must be consulted with caution.|$|E
25|$|Around 90% of the Berber-speaking {{population}} speak one of {{six major}} varieties of Berber, each {{with at least two}} million speakers. They are, in order of number of speakers: Shilha (Tacelḥit/Tasussit), Kabyle (Taqbaylit), Central Atlas <b>Tamazight</b> (Tamaziɣt), Riffian (Tmaziɣt), Shawiya (Tacawit) and Tuareg (Tamaceq/Tamajaq/Tamahaq). The extinct Guanche language spoken on the Canary Islands by the Guanches, as well as the languages of the ancient C-Group culture in present-day southern Egypt and northern Sudan, are believed to have belonged to the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic family.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{the term}} <b>Tamazight</b> (in various forms: Thamazighth, Tamasheq, Tamajaq, Tamahaq) {{was used by}} many Berber groups {{to refer to the}} {{language}} they spoke, including the Middle Atlas, the Riffians, the Sened in Tunisia and the Tuareg. However, other terms were used by other groups; for instance, some Berber populations of Algeria called their language Taznatit (Zenati) or Shelha, while the Kabyles called theirs Taqbaylit, and the inhabitants of the Siwa Oasis called their language Siwi. In Tunisia, the local Amazigh language is usually referred to as Shelha, a term which has been observed in Morocco as well.|$|E
25|$|The Voice of Free Libya (Arabic: Sawt Libya al-Hurra) or {{sometimes}} Radio Free Libya (Arabic: Idha'at Libya al-Hurra) are the names used by several radio stations {{aligned with the}} Libyan rebels. The stations began operating from the cities of Benghazi, Bayda, and Misrata in February 2011. Other rebel-controlled radio stations are reported to operate in Tobruk, Nalut, Jadu, Derna, and Zliten. The outlets operate independently and with separate programing, although they share similar aims. They all carry material strongly supportive of the rebels and firmly critical of Gaddafi. Output is in Arabic, with the Nalut station also said to use Berber (<b>Tamazight).</b>|$|E
25|$|Twenty or so Berber {{languages}} (also called <b>Tamazight)</b> are {{spoken in}} North Africa. Berber speakers were once predominant over all this large area, {{but as a}} result of Arabization and later local migrations, today Berber languages are reduced to several large regions (in Morocco, Algeria, and the central Sahara) or remain as smaller language islands. Several linguists characterize the Berber spoken as one language with many dialect variations, spread out in discrete regions, without ongoing standardization. The Berber languages may be classified as follows (with some more widely known languages or language groups shown in italics). Ethnic historical correspondence is suggested by the designation |Tribe|.|$|E
25|$|Classical Arabic {{began to}} be {{installed}} as a governmental and administrative language in Tunisia that was called then Ifriqiya from its older name Africa during the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in 673. The people of several urban cities were progressively influenced by Arabic. By the 11th century, through contact of local languages such as African Romance or Berber with Classical Arabic, some urban dialects appeared in the main coastal cities of Tunisia. The dialects were slightly and characteristically influenced by several common Berber structures and vocabulary like negation because <b>Tamazight</b> was the language of contact for citizens of that period. The new dialects were also significantly influenced by other historical languages.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{cultural}} and political movement among speakers of the closely related varieties of Northern Berber to promote and unify them under a written standard language called Tamaziɣt. The name Tamaziɣt (or <b>Tamazight)</b> is the current native name of the Berber language in the Moroccan Middle Atlas region, the Rif regions and the Libyan Zuwarah region. In other Berber-speaking areas this name was lost. There is historical evidence from medieval Berber manuscripts that all indigenous North Africans from Libya to Morocco have at some point called their language Tamaziɣt. The name Tamaziɣt is currently being used increasingly by educated Berbers {{to refer to the}} written Berber language, and even to Berber as a whole, including Tuareg.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} a long and fierce debate on whether to use the Latin alphabet, the Tifinagh alphabet, or the Arabic alphabet, as the {{official}} alphabet for Berber in Algeria and Morocco, between Berber activists and the anti-Berber establishments, mainly those with Arab-Islamic agendas or orientations. The Berber activists overwhelmingly favor the use of the Latin alphabet in order to ensure a quick development and proliferation of the Berber language (<b>Tamazight)</b> in schools, in public institutions, and on the internet. A small number of them prefer the neo-Tifinagh alphabet. The states of Morocco and Algeria usually distance themselves from Latin-based Berber writing, fearing that it would strengthen the position of Berber against Arabic and French, and thus leading to a stronger Berber political activism. The Arab-Islamic establishments and political parties often reject the Latin alphabet as a Berber alphabet for the same reasons, and they usually brand it as a tool to westernize and Christianize Berbers.|$|E
500|$|Central Atlas <b>Tamazight</b> {{language}} (also {{known as}} Central Morocco <b>Tamazight,</b> Middle Atlas <b>Tamazight,</b> <b>Tamazight,</b> Central Shilha, and, rarely, Beraber or Braber; native name: ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖⵜ <b>Tamazight</b> [...] ) is a Berber {{language of the}} Afroasiatic language family, spoken by 3 to 5million people in the Atlas Mountains of Central Morocco, {{as well as by}} smaller emigrant communities in France and elsewhere.|$|E
