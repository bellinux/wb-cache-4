50|$|Martens was {{introduced}} to the New South Wales gentry and soon achieved success in Sydney with several commissions. He {{went on to become the}} most proficient, prominent and prolific landscape artist in the colony. The Beagle arrived in 1836, and Darwin and Captain Fitzroy commissioned a number of paintings from the Beagle's voyages in Tierra Del Fuego and the Pacific. Other large commissions followed, and in 1837 some of Martens' Australian watercolours were exhibited at the Royal Society in London. In 1839, however, a drought triggered an economic recession which was to last until the 1850s, and commissions became increasingly difficult to acquire. In the 1840s he turned <b>to</b> <b>lithographs,</b> which allowed him to sell the same work many times over - his 'View of Sydney from the North Shore' was especially popular.|$|R

At the Salon d'Automne in 1904, a room was dedicated to his paintings and lithographs.|$|R
50|$|The {{next great}} work he {{undertook}} was the deciphering of the Avesta manuscripts brought to France by Anquetil-Duperron.

5000|$|His works {{reflected}} {{this lack}} of unity in definition as well as form, as Westermann produced {{a wide array of}} works, from sculptures <b>to</b> <b>lithographs,</b> using materials ranging from paper and plywood to brass and lead. [...] Yet all his works reflected a common theme, shaped by his wartime experiences. In a letter to a friend, Westermann describes a situation he experienced aboard the USS Enterprise {{in the early days of}} the Pacific campaign. He was strapped into an anti-aircraft gun emplacement on the stern of the ship when they came under attack by Japanese aircraft. A kamikaze pilot streaked towards the ship prompting Westermann to fire upon, hit, and consequentially deflect the aircraft into the front of his ship, where he was powerless to watch it impact and explode the bow as he was strapped to the stern. [...] In this letter, Westermann goes on to explain that this memory, and many more like it, were still vividly ingrained in his mind.|$|R

Since the government established a weaving studio in 1970, many Inuit have learned to weave and are producing tapestries and other works that find an international market.|$|R
