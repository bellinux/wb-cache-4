50|$|In {{mechanics}} of material, {{the strength of}} a material is its ability to withstand an applied load without failure or plastic deformation.The field of strength of materials deals with forces and deformations that result from their acting on a material.A load applied to a mechanical member will induce internal forces within <b>the</b> <b>member</b> called stresses when those forces are expressed on a unit basis. The stresses acting on the material cause deformation of the material in various manners. Deformation of the material is called strain when those deformations too are placed on a unit basis. The applied loads may be axial (tensile or compressive), or rotational (strength shear). The stresses and strains that develop within a mechanical member must be calculated in order to assess the load capacity of that member. This requires a complete description of the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>member,</b> its constraints, <b>the</b> loads applied to <b>the</b> <b>member</b> and <b>the</b> properties of the material of which <b>the</b> <b>member</b> is composed. With a complete description of the loading and the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>member,</b> <b>the</b> state of stress and of state of strain at any point within <b>the</b> <b>member</b> can be calculated. Once the state of stress and strain within <b>the</b> <b>member</b> is known, <b>the</b> strength (load carrying capacity) of that member, its deformations (stiffness qualities), and its stability (ability to maintain its original configuration) can be calculated. The calculated stresses may then be compared to some measure of the strength of <b>the</b> <b>member</b> such as its material yield or ultimate strength. The calculated deflection of <b>the</b> <b>member</b> may be compared to a deflection criteria that is based on <b>the</b> <b>member's</b> use. <b>The</b> calculated buckling load of <b>the</b> <b>member</b> may be compared to the applied load. The calculated stiffness and mass distribution of <b>the</b> <b>member</b> may be used to calculate <b>the</b> <b>member's</b> dynamic response and then compared to the acoustic environment in which it will be used.|$|R
