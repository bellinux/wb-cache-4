This framework, along with other tools and approaches, is outlined in London's Base of the Pyramid Promise and has been implemented by companies, non-profits, and development agencies in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are other}} reasons that charter schools appeal to some parents. Most SCASD {{charters}} use a variation of a teaching method called instructional system development or ISD requiring a teacher to identify the task, condition, and testing standard for each <b>teaching</b> <b>module</b> of every subject. This helps students who need more structure. In charter schools most homework is done in school with teacher supervision. Teacher unions rebel at the entire concept and prefer the so-called critical thinking concept. ISD, used correctly by design, actually improves critical thinking and is used increasingly in STEM courses. The military, modern industry, NASA, and Japanese schools among many others use ISD. ISD is not explained as a teaching methodology on the SCASD website. http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/doe/isd/paper.htm ...|$|E

This research uses embedded design (quasi experimental and case studies). Researcher use 70 students as are sample who were chosen by purposive and matching sampling. A total of 35 students were chosen as the treatment group and the rest as are control group. Researchers develop teaching modules for Geography subject based on radical constructivism known as Geography <b>Teaching</b> <b>Module</b> CSAA to overcome the rural students’ learning problem. The <b>teaching</b> <b>module</b> consists of three main phases which are cognitive scheme; assimilation and accommodation used as intervention to the treatment group. Meanwhile, the control groups were taught using the teacher-centered approach. Data were collected through pre and post tests, observations and document analysis conducted by the researcher. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed {{that there was no}} difference in post test scores for the control and treatment group of low cognitive level. Meanwhile, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for medium and high cognitive level showed significant difference between the two groups. The findings show that the use of Geography <b>Teaching</b> <b>Module</b> CSAA can improve students’ thinking skills. The implementation of Geography <b>Teaching</b> <b>Module</b> CSAA could increase thinking skills as the use of student-centered approach to encourage students to participate actively in the discovery of knowledge (qualitative data) ...|$|E
