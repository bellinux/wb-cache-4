5|$|After the {{resignation}} of South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint to run Heritage Foundation, Colbert was named a possible candidate for appointment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> being vacated by DeMint, which would have triggered a special election in 2014 to finish out DeMint's term. Although Governor Nikki Haley announced promptly {{that she had no}} intention to nominate Colbert to the Senate, a poll showed Colbert as a favorite among South Carolina voters.|$|E
5|$|Weaver soon {{returned}} to politics, when on 8 October 1927, at the 1927 election, {{he was elected}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of Neutral Bay with 69.49%. Rising to prominence within the party, Weaver gained a reputation as an independent-minded but powerful debater in the House, crossing the floor on many issues.|$|E
5|$|After {{visiting the}} village of Annisa to see his dying sister Macrina, he {{returned}} to Nyssa in August. In 380 he travelled to Sebaste, {{in the province of}} Armenia Prima, to support a pro-Nicene candidate for the election to the bishopric. To his surprise, he himself was elected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> perhaps due to the population's association of him with his brother. However, Gregory deeply disliked the relatively unhellenized society of Armenia, and he was confronted by an investigation into his orthodoxy by local opponents of the Nicene theology. After a stay of several months, a substitute was found - possibly Gregory's brother Peter, who was bishop of Sebaste from 381 - and Gregory returned home to Nyssa to write books I and II of Against Eunomius.|$|E

Marceline, in her evil demon form, listens to the requests of her subjects, often ignoring what they seek and instead punishing them with macabre torture. Finn and Jake are spotted by Marceline, who gives chase. After narrowly avoiding their demonic friend, the duo run into the now-benign Hunson Abadeer, who explains that he only wanted Marceline to follow in his footsteps and rule the hellish realm.|$|E
5|$|Dissatisfied {{with city}} politics, and in {{financial}} difficulty {{due to his}} failing restaurant business and low annual salary of $9,600, former police officer and Supervisor Dan White resigned from the San Francisco Board of Supervisors on November 10, 1978. However, after {{a meeting with the}} Police Officers' association and the Board of Realtors, White announced that he wanted his seat back. Liberal Supervisors saw {{this as an opportunity to}} end the 6-5 split on the Board that blocked progressive initiatives they wanted to introduce. After intense lobbying by Supervisors Milk and Silver, as well as State Assemblyman Willie Brown, Moscone announced on November 26, 1978, that he would not be reappointing Dan White <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> he had vacated.|$|E
5|$|In 1801 in the Mediterranean, {{under the}} command of Admiral Lord Keith, Kent carried Sir Ralph Abercromby and his {{headquarters}} for the invasion of Egypt, a successful campaign which forced the surrender of the French occupying force. Hope was not present for the conclusion of the action, returning to Britain with Admiral Duncan after Sir Richard Bickerton raised his flag on Kent. He was awarded the Order of the Crescent by Emperor Selim III for this service. In 1800, Hope began his second career, gaining the seat of Dumfries Burghs in the House of Commons through family influence. During his time as MP, Hope rarely visited his constituency and equally rarely appeared in parliament. He lost the constituency to his brother in 1802, but in 1804 was elected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of Dumfriesshire, again through family connections. He retained this post until his retirement from public life in 1830.|$|E

5|$|In 1830, Wickliffe {{was chosen}} by his colleagues {{as one of the}} {{managers}} of the impeachment proceedings against Missouri District Court judge James H. Peck. In 1831, he was one of several candidates proposed by the Kentucky General Assembly to succeed John Rowan in the U.S. Senate. Of the sixty-nine votes needed to be elected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> Wickliffe received forty-nine. Other candidates included John J. Crittenden (sixty-eight votes), John Breathitt (sixty-six votes), and Richard Mentor Johnson (sixty-four votes). After three days of balloting, the Assembly was still unable to fill the seat, and it was allowed to remain vacant until the next session. Wickliffe did not seek re-election to his seat in the House in 1833.|$|E
5|$|It also {{provided}} for the Court of First Instance (now known as the General Court) to be based in Luxembourg with the Court of Justice, which remained there. However, this agreement dropped the provision from the 1965 decision, which gave priority to Luxembourg for any new judicial and financial bodies. In response, Luxembourg attached a unilateral declaration stating it did not renounce this article. However they did renounce any claim <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of the judicial Boards of Appeal of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market via the Treaty of Nice.|$|E
5|$|Long {{was elected}} to the United States Congress in the 1882 election, and served until 1889, declining to run for reelection in the 1888 election. In 1886, he was {{encouraged}} to stand for the Senate by Henry Cabot Lodge, although Lodge's support was apparently part of a ruse to test the strength of the state party leadership. Lodge withdrew his support at the last minute, throwing it instead to the incumbent Henry L. Dawes, and the legislature reelected Dawes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> The incident cooled relations between Lodge and Long. In the wheeling and dealing that preceded the Senate election, Long was offered Democratic support by Butler, but refused, believing that such votes would be seen as tainted by an unsavory political deal.|$|E

5|$|Members of the Maryland Senate {{are elected}} every four years, in off-year {{elections}} {{in the middle of}} terms for Presidents of the United States. Party nominations are determined by primary elections. The general election for Senate seats and all other state and federal {{elections in the}} normal cycle is held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Should a Senate seat become vacant {{in the middle of a}} term, because of death, illness, incapacitation, disqualification, resignation, or expulsion of a member of the Senate, that seat is filled by appointment. The Central Committee of the previous Senator's party in the county or counties in which the Senate district lies makes a recommendation to the Governor on whom to appoint <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> Within fifteen days of the Central Committee's recommendation being selected, the Governor must appoint that person to the vacant seat.|$|E
5|$|A {{key feature}} of the F-16's cockpit is the {{exceptional}} field of view. The single-piece, bird-proof polycarbonate bubble canopy provides 360° all-round visibility, with a 40° look-down angle {{over the side of}} the aircraft, and 15° down over the nose (compared to the common 12–13° of preceding aircraft); the pilot's seat is elevated for this purpose. Furthermore, the F-16's canopy lacks the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's forward vision. The F-16's ACES II zero/zero ejection seat is reclined at an unusual tilt-back angle of 30°; most fighters have a tilted seat at 13–15°. The tilted seat can accommodate taller pilots and increases G-force tolerance; however it has been associated with reports of neck ache, possibly caused by incorrect head-rest usage. Subsequent U.S. fighters have adopted more modest tilt-back angles of 20°. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> angle and the canopy's thickness, the ejection seat lacks canopy-breakers for emergency egress; instead the entire canopy is jettisoned prior to the seat's rocket firing.|$|E
5|$|Flournoy {{was elected}} to {{represent}} the 12th Senatorial District, consisting of Grant, Hampshire, Hardy, Mineral, and Pendleton counties, in the West Virginia Senate in 1885 and was re-elected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> in 1889. In the West Virginia state senatorial election on November 6, 1888, Flournoy defeated his Republican challenger S.G. Pownall with 5,578 votes to Pownall's 4,028 votes. Following his election, Flournoy was selected as part of West Virginia's attending delegation to the inauguration of President Benjamin Harrison. In his first term in the West Virginia Senate, Flournoy {{served as chairman of}} the Judiciary Committee, and in his second term he served as chairman of the Committee on Counties and Municipal Corporations. Throughout his two terms, Flournoy served on the committees of Privileges and Elections, Federal Relations, Immigration and Agriculture, and Public Printing. In 1890, during his second term in the West Virginia Senate, Flournoy relocated from Romney to Charleston and continued practicing law there. He resigned from his senate seat in 1890.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{appointed}} two Associate Justices to the Supreme Court. The first vacancy {{occurred when}} David Davis resigned {{to enter the}} Senate during the election controversy of 1876. On taking office, Hayes appointed John Marshall Harlan <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> A former candidate for governor of Kentucky, Harlan had been Benjamin Bristow's campaign manager at the 1876 Republican convention, and Hayes had earlier considered him for Attorney General. Hayes submitted the nomination in October 1877, but it aroused some dissent in the Senate because of Harlan's limited experience in public office. Harlan was nonetheless confirmed and served on the court for thirty-four years, in which he voted (usually in the minority) for an aggressive enforcement {{of the civil rights}} laws. In 1880, a second seat became vacant upon the resignation of Justice William Strong. Hayes nominated William Burnham Woods, a carpetbagger Republican circuit court judge from Alabama. Woods served six years on the Court, ultimately proving a disappointment to Hayes as he interpreted the Constitution in a manner more similar to that of Southern Democrats than to Hayes's own preferences.|$|E
5|$|On November 20, 2012, a melee {{occurred}} at a Newark City Council meeting attended by Booker. The nine-seat council was {{to vote on the}} successor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> vacated by newly elected U.S. Representative Donald M. Payne,Jr. Booker's opponents on the council, including Ras Baraka, sought to appoint John Sharpe James, son of the former mayor, while Booker and his supporters favored Shanique Speight. Booker attended the meeting to deal with the eventuality of the lack of a quorum or a tie vote, in which state law would allow him to cast a deciding vote. After Baraka was refused an opportunity to address the council by acting Council President Anibal Ramos,Jr., Baraka and two other council members walked away in protest. Booker cast the deciding vote for Speight. Supporters of James stormed the stage and were held back by riot police, who eventually used pepper spray on some members of the crowd. Baraka later blamed Booker for inciting the disturbance, while Booker refused comment to the media after the vote.|$|E
