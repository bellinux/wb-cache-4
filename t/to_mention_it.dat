5|$|Sources {{are silent}} {{regarding}} the events following the first Persian campaign but the silence {{in itself is}} an indication of the peace that prevailed and that the Persians stopped being a threat to the Roman East. The evidence for the second campaign is meager; Zosimus is the only one <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> specifically. A passage in the Sibylline Oracles is interpreted by Hartmann as an indication of the second invasion. The campaign took place in 266 or 267 and was aimed directly at Ctesiphon; Odaenathus reached the walls of the Persian capital but had to cancel the siege and march north to face the influx of Germanic riders attacking Anatolia.|$|E
5|$|Ever since Joseph Merrick's days as {{a novelty}} exhibit on Whitechapel Road, his {{condition}} {{has been a source}} of curiosity for medical professionals. His appearance at the meeting of the Pathological Society of London in 1884 drew interest from the doctors present, but none of the answers nor the attention that Treves had hoped for. The case received only a brief mention in the British Medical Journal, and the Lancet declined <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> at all. Four months later, in 1885, Treves brought the case before the meeting for a second time. By then, Tom Norman's shop on Whitechapel Road had been closed, and the Elephant Man had moved on. Without Merrick, Treves made do with the photographs he had taken during his examinations. One of the doctors present at the meeting was Henry Radcliffe Crocker, a dermatologist who was an authority on skin diseases. After hearing Treves's description of Merrick, and viewing the photographs, Crocker proposed that Merrick's condition might be a combination of dermatolysis, pachydermatocele and an unnamed bone deformity, all caused by changes in the nervous system. Crocker wrote about Merrick's case in his 1888 book Diseases of the Skin: their Description, Pathology, Diagnosis and Treatment.|$|E

5|$|Opinion amongst modern historians is also split; for instance, Fine {{accepts the}} concept of the Peace of Callias, whereas Sealey {{effectively}} rejects it. Holland accepts that some kind of accommodation was made between Athens and Persia, but no actual treaty. Fine argues that Callisthenes's denial that a treaty was made after the Eurymedon does not preclude a peace being made at another point. Further, he suggests that Theopompus was actually referring to a treaty that had allegedly been negotiated with Persia in 423 BC. If these views are correct, it would remove one major obstacle to the acceptance of the treaty's existence. A further argument for the existence of the treaty is the sudden withdrawal of the Athenians from Cyprus in 449 BC, which Fine suggests makes most sense in the light of some kind of peace agreement. On the other hand, if there was indeed some kind of accommodation, Thucydides's failure <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> is odd. In his digression on the pentekontaetia, his aim is to explain the growth of Athenian power, and such a treaty, {{and the fact that the}} Delian allies were not released from their obligations after it, would have marked a major step in the Athenian ascendancy. Conversely, it has been suggested that certain passages elsewhere in Thucydides's history are best interpreted as referring to a peace agreement. There is thus no clear consensus amongst modern historians as to the treaty's existence.|$|E

25|$|According to Paul L Maier, {{most modern}} biographies of Herod {{do not believe}} the {{massacre}} took place. Steve Mason argues that if the massacre had taken place as described in Matthew, it would have been strange for Josephus not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> and that the massacre may hence be non-historical. E. P. Sanders characterizes Josephus' writing as dwelling on Herod's cruelty, thus suggesting that Josephus would probably have included the event if it had occurred. Sanders states that faced with little historical information, Matthew's account is apparently based on the story in which an infant Moses is endangered by the Pharaoh in order to kill infant Hebrews and that such use of scripture for telling the story of Jesus' birth was considered legitimate by contemporary standards.|$|E
25|$|In 1897, Steuerman was a {{contributor}} to Noutatea ("The Novelty"), an independent daily published in Iași by the Jewish poet Berman Goldner-Giordano. This short-lived gazette had a relatively obscure history, {{and one of its}} contributors, the maverick socialist Garabet Ibrăileanu reportedly forgot <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> in all his later accounts of the period. Its regular contributors were young supporters of left-wing ideologies: alongside Steuerman and Giordano, they include poet Mihail Codreanu and future jurist Eugen Heroveanu. With Codreanu, Steuerman (who usually disguised his name under the signatures Rodion, Aster, Leander and Tristis) took charge of the literary column and the poetry section. They were sporadically joined by other writers, among them Laura Vampa, Alexandru Toma, I. A. Bassarabescu, George Ranetti etc.|$|E
25|$|Mrs. Coulter takes Lyra {{into her}} home, {{in a big}} city that resembles a retrofuturistic London, and starts taking her to socialite dinners and parties. In her bedroom, Lyra gazes upon the alethiometer and notices that it {{continuously}} points to a lady, a lightning bolt, and a baby. She does not {{know what to make of}} her observation, however, and says nothing of it to Mrs.Coulter. Despite initially projecting the image of a free-spirited woman, she reveals herself to be extremely respectful of the Magisterium and its function. One night, Lyra casually mentions Dust; this puts Mrs. Coulter on edge as she warns Lyra never <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> again, and also insists that she stop carrying around the bag secretly containing the aleithiometer. Mrs.Coulter's dæmon (a golden monkey) attacks Pantalaimon, causing Lyra to give in. Lyra and Pantalaimon discover that Mrs.Coulter is head of the General Oblation Board, also known as the “Gobblers”, who have been kidnapping local children. Lyra also learns that her best friend Roger and her Gyptian friend Billy have been both taken by the Gobblers.|$|E

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 4, 1910. The film was released outside of the planned order due to a scheduling conflict. Originally The American and the Queen was planned to be released on this date, but it was instead pushed back to November 11. The film received mixed reviews from critics, H. Jeanval of The Moving Picture News stated that the costuming and lace curtains on {{the windows of the}} home betrayed the supposed poverty of the Morgan family. Walton, also of The Moving Picture News, stated, [...] "This title would be completely misunderstood by the majority of moving picture show attendants. Some sporadic 'reformer' who does not know the original and who has never seen the film will fill 'space' on the iniquity of moving pictures founded on this title. If he did see the film it has not the necessary power to grapple with the terrible reality of a too common incident in daily life." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was more picky in its wording and praise, stating: [...] "It was to be supposed that some company would finally present this familiar drama in pictorial form, and a reviewer must feel glad that it is over, for the film doesn't materially exalt the level of film output." [...] The review found the acting to be good, but found fault {{in the shadows of the}} actors fell towards a lamp instead of away from it. The New York Dramatic Mirror was not a neutral party for reviews and took a shot at the Thanhouser Company by running an article that stated: [...] "The Selig Company announces the production of Ten Nights in a Bar Room will not be confined to one reel, but will be given all the film that it requires for proper production. This departure from the restrictive limit of 1,000 feet gives promise that the drama will have adequate treatment." [...] Bowers states that the paper [...] "was acting the role of a spoiler, for the Selig version was not released until a half year later, in June 1911, and, except for spite, there was no reason <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> now." ...|$|E

2500|$|The many {{problems}} with Livy's account and Diodorus' failure <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> has even caused some historians {{to reject the}} entire war as unhistorical.

Livy was clearly embarrassed at the way Rome had turned from being an ally to an enemy of the Samnites. [...] It is also unlikely that the Romans could have established such a dominating position in Campania as they had after 341 without Samnite resistance. [...] Finally Diodorus ignores many other events in early Roman history such as all {{the early years of the}} Second Samnite War; his omission of the First Samnite War can therefore not be taken as proof of its unhistoricity.|$|E

Toth orders a complete evacuation of the planet, but Gabriel refuses, stating his desire to investigate the possible threat of Chaos. Toth then implies that Gabriel's actions on Cyrene have clouded his judgement, making him [...] "see Chaos where it doesn't exist".
