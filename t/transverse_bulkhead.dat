5|$|The armor {{scheme of}} the Gangut-class ships had some {{significant}} weaknesses. The rear <b>transverse</b> <b>bulkhead</b> was unprotected {{by any other}} armor but was the same thickness as the forward bulkhead which was defended by the upper belt armor. The thinness of the barbette armor was a serious defect which could have proved fatal in a battle. And {{the lack of a}} splinter bulkhead behind the armor of the turrets, barbettes and conning towers left all of those locations vulnerable to main gun hits. But the biggest weakness was the lack of an anti-torpedo bulkhead, which made them highly vulnerable to mines or torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|In November, the Board {{agreed to}} a {{compromise}} design that incorporated a secondary battery of eight 8in guns in four twin turrets amidships and twelve 7in guns in casemates. The decision to retain the 8in guns was made in large part due to American experiences in the Spanish–American War three years before. US Navy officers had been impressed {{with the performance of}} the gun at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba; despite scoring only 13 hits out of 309 shells fired, the gun had a flat trajectory and good range for its size. Armor protection was improved over the BuOrd design, with a thicker armored belt and casemate protection, albeit at the expense of thinner armor covering the barbettes that supported the gun turrets. The designers reasoned that since the barbettes were behind the belt and a <b>transverse</b> <b>bulkhead,</b> weight could be saved by reducing the level of direct protection.|$|E
25|$|A ship will sink if the {{transverse}} bulkheads are so {{far apart}} that flooding a single compartment would consume all the ship's reserve buoyancy. Aside from the possible protection of machinery, or areas most susceptible to damage, such a ship would be no better than a ship without watertight subdivision, and is called a one-compartment ship. A ship capable of remaining afloat when any single watertight compartment is flooded is called a two-compartment ship, but damage destroying the tightness of a <b>transverse</b> <b>bulkhead</b> may cause flooding of two compartments and loss of the ship. A ship able to remain afloat with any two compartments flooded is called a three-compartment ship, and will withstand damage to one <b>transverse</b> <b>bulkhead.</b>|$|E
