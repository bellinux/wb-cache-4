In the experiment, one half of a pico-second visible entangled photon pair at 780 nm is converted to a 1522 -nm photon, resulting in the entangled photon pair between 780 nm and 1522 nm. Using superconducting single-photon detectors with low dark count rates and small <b>timing</b> <b>jitters,</b> we selectively observed well-defined temporal modes containing the two photons. We achieved a fidelity of 0. 93 ± 0. 04 after the wavelength conversion, indicating that our solid-state-based scheme {{can be used for}} faithful frequency down-conversion of visible photons emitted from quantum memories composed of various media.

While spatially separated sources asynchronously emit photon pairs, the time-resolved photon detection guarantees the temporal indistinguishability of photons without active timing synchronizations of pump lasers and/or adjustment of optical paths. In the experiment, photons are sufficiently narrowed by fiber-based Bragg gratings with the central wavelengths of 1541 nm and 1580 nm, and detected by superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors with low <b>timing</b> <b>jitters.</b> Observed fidelities are 0. 84 ± 0. 04 and 0. 70 ± 0. 05 for the entanglement swapping and generation of the GHZ state, respectively.

50|$|In some {{semiconductor}} lasers {{a combination}} of the two above techniques can be used. Using a laser with a saturable absorber, and modulating the electrical injection at the same frequency the laser is locked at, the laser can be stabilized by the electrical injection. This has the advantage of stabilizing the phase noise of the laser, and can reduce the <b>timing</b> <b>jitter</b> of the pulses from the laser.|$|E
50|$|Deterministic jitter {{is a type}} of clock <b>timing</b> <b>jitter</b> or {{data signal}} jitter that is {{predictable}} and reproducible. The peak-to-peak value of this jitter is bounded, and the bounds can easily be observed and predicted. Deterministic jitter can either be correlated to the data stream (data-dependent jitter) or uncorrelated to the data stream (bounded uncorrelated jitter). Examples of data-dependent jitter are duty-cycle dependent jitter (also known as duty-cycle distortion) and intersymbol interference.|$|E

50|$|The {{trapezoid}} body {{is where}} most of the cochlear nucleus (CN) fibers decussate (cross left to right and vice versa); this cross aids in sound localization. The CN breaks into ventral (VCN) and dorsal (DCN) regions. The VCN has three nuclei. Bushy cells transmit timing info, their shape averages <b>timing</b> <b>jitters.</b> Stellate (chopper) cells encode sound spectra (peaks and valleys) by spatial neural firing rates based on auditory input strength (rather than frequency). Octopus cells have close to the best temporal precision while firing, they decode the auditory timing code. The DCN has 2 nuclei. DCN also receives info from VCN. Fusiform cells integrate information to determine spectral cues to locations (for example, whether a sound originated from in front or behind). Cochlear nerve fibers (30,000+) each have a most sensitive frequency and respond over a wide range of levels.|$|R

50|$|Jitter is the {{undesired}} {{deviation from}} true periodicity of an assumed periodic signal in electronics and telecommunications, often {{in relation to}} a reference clock source. Jitter may be observed in characteristics such as the frequency of successive pulses, the signal amplitude, or phase of periodic signals. Jitter is a significant, and usually undesired, factor in the design of almost all communications links (e.g., USB, PCI-e, SATA, OC-48). In clock recovery applications it is called <b>timing</b> <b>jitter.</b>|$|E
50|$|No single {{measurement}} {{can assess}} audio quality. Instead, engineers use {{a series of}} measurements to analyze various types of degradation that can reduce fidelity. Thus, when testing an analogue tape machine {{it is necessary to}} test for wow and flutter and tape speed variations over longer periods, as well as for distortion and noise. When testing a digital system, testing for speed variations is normally considered unnecessary because of the accuracy of clocks in digital circuitry, but testing for aliasing and <b>timing</b> <b>jitter</b> is often desirable, as these have caused audible degradation in many systems.|$|E
50|$|BERT {{instruments}} are often found near oscilloscopes because they complement each other. The BERT provides the bottom-line capability of determining if digital bits are being communicated effectively, {{but if they}} are not, the oscilloscope provides the ability to see the underlying analog waveform used to communicate the digital bits. It is common for underlying analog problems, such as <b>timing</b> <b>jitter</b> or amplitude noise or slow rise-time, to translate into digital bit errors. Beginning in a digital television product called the DVA184-C, and then following with the high-definition video product HDVA-292, and every BERT product afterwards, SyntheSys Research engineers integrated the ability to display the analog eye-diagram of the signal being evaluated.|$|E
40|$|To examine neural {{responses}} to aurally-presented sentences, a sparse imaging technique {{was used to}} minimize interference from scanner noise. The patient was played a single sentence (or noise-equivalent) in the 7. 4 s silent period before a single 1. 6 s scan with stimulus <b>timing</b> <b>jittered</b> relative to scan onset. There were 118 spoken sentences trials, 59 signal correlated noise trials, and an additional 60 silent trials {{for the purpose of}} monitoring data quality. The signal correlated noise stimuli had the same duration, spectral profile and amplitude envelope as the original speech, but were entirely unintelligible (S 1). The experiment was divided into three sessions of 79 trials with events pseudo-randomly ordered within each scanning session. The sentences were presented using a MRI compatible auditory stimulusdelivery system (Resonance Technology, Northridge, CA), with insert earplugs to further attenuate scanner noise. DMDX software running on a Windows XP PC was used to present the stimulus items. The mental imagery task was administered as a block design with alternating 30 second periods of task and rest.

40|$|Single-photon {{detection}} {{technologies are}} of high relevance to {{light detection and ranging}} (LiDAR) {{applications for the}} range resolution and surface profiling of distant target objects. Modern single-photon detectors offer high quantum efficiencies and small <b>timing</b> <b>jitters</b> in the order of tens of ps, allowing for the rapid acquisition of high-resolution time-of-flight information with eye-safe illumination powers. In time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), every detection event is treated as an independent measurement of time. The build-up of photon statistics over many measurement cycles allows for time-of-flight measurements with a precision that can be superior to the system’s single-shot timing uncertainty. This Thesis presents work on a scanning, long-range depth profiler based on TCSPC. Its design is discussed and a comprehensive set of performance metrics is evaluated, serving as the base for a theoretical performance model. Beside measurements at an illumination wavelength of 842 nm, the operation of the system at 1. 56 m is also described. A special focus is made on the implementation and evaluation of different single-photon detection modules, including a novel, resonant-cavity-enhanced single-photon avalanche diode. A new data acquisition mode for TCSPC applications was developed to facilitate performance evaluation. Depth uncertainties of 250 m were achieved with the system at 320 m stand-off distance, and a pattern matching scheme was implemented to acquire unambiguous photon-counting depth images at a record-breaking target distance of 4. 4 km while maintaining eye-safe illumination levels. Advanced return analysis algorithms were used to demonstrate the automatic resolution of multiple target surfaces...|$|R
5000|$|Injection seeders are {{devices that}} direct {{the output of}} small [...] "seed" [...] lasers into the cavity {{of a much larger}} laser to {{stabilize}} the latter's output. Most seed lasers are stable, single-frequency lasers that emit within the linewidth of the larger laser's gain medium. The single frequency encourages the larger laser to lase in a single longitudinal mode, and the seed laser can also improve the laser's spatial profile and improve the M2 parameter. Seed lasers can be continuous or pulsed. Seeding a pulsed laser can reduce variations in the output energy and <b>timing</b> (<b>jitter)</b> from pulse to pulse, and smooth out temporal variations within the pulse. Many commercial lasers use a laser diode as a seeding source.|$|E
50|$|Unlike earlier Ethernet {{standards}} using broadband and coaxial cable, such as 10BASE5 (thicknet) and 10BASE2 (thinnet), 10BASE-T {{does not}} specify the exact type of wiring to be used, but instead specifies certain characteristics that a cable must meet. This {{was done in}} anticipation of using 10BASE-T in existing twisted-pair wiring systems that may not conform to any specified wiring standard. Some of the specified characteristics are attenuation, characteristic impedance, <b>timing</b> <b>jitter,</b> propagation delay, and several types of noise. Cable testers are widely available to check these parameters {{to determine if a}} cable can be used with 10BASE-T. These characteristics are expected to be met by 100 meters of 24-gauge unshielded twisted-pair cable. However, with high quality cabling, cable runs of 150 meters or longer are often obtained and are considered viable by most technicians familiar with the 10BASE-T specification.|$|E
50|$|Supercontinuum sources {{driven by}} ultrashort pump pulses (on {{the order of}} tens of femtoseconds in {{duration}} or less) are generally much more stable than those pumped by longer pulses. Even though such supercontinuum sources may make use of anomalous or zero dispersion, the propagation lengths are usually short enough that noise-seeded modulation instability has a less significant impact. The broadband nature of the input radiation makes it such that octave-spanning supercontinua can be achieved with relatively modest broadening factors. Even so, the noise dynamics of such sources can still be nontrivial, though they are generally stable and can be suitable for precision time-resolved measurements and frequency metrology. Nevertheless, soliton <b>timing</b> <b>jitter</b> in supercontinuum generation with 100 fs pulses has also been traced to input noise amplification by modulation instability, and L-shaped statistics in filtered energy have been observed in supercontinuum sources driven by such pulses. Extreme statistics have also been observed with pumping in the normal dispersion regime, wherein modulation instability occurs due the contribution of higher-order dispersion.|$|E

5000|$|This {{technique}} {{analyzes the}} time difference between the excitation of the sample molecule {{and the release of}} energy as another photon. Repeating this process many times will give a decay profile. Pulsed lasers or LEDs {{can be used as a}} source of excitation. Part of the light passes through the sample, the other to the electronics as [...] "sync" [...] signal. The light emitted by the sample molecule is passed through a monochromator to select a specific wavelength. The light then is detected and amplified by a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The emitted light signal as well as reference light signal is processed through a constant fraction discriminator (CFD) which eliminates <b>timing</b> <b>jitter.</b> After passing through the CFD, the reference pulse activates a time-to-amplitude converter (TAC) circuit. The TAC charges a capacitor which will hold the signal until the next electrical pulse. In reverse TAC mode the signal of [...] "sync" [...] stops the TAC. This data is then further processed by an analog to digital converter (ADC) and multi-channel analyzer (MCA) to get a data output. To make sure that the decay is not biased to early arriving photons, the photon count rate is kept low (usually less than 1% of excitation rate).|$|E
