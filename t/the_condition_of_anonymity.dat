Plott and Zeiler (2005) find {{no difference in}} elicited valuations after implementing procedures that provide for anonymity and experience with the second-price mechanism. This paper investigates whether anonymity is a necessary for their result. Employing a similar design to theirs, we find their general result holds in conditions both with and without anonymity. Contrary to predictions of one theory—which suggest social pressures may cause differences in subject valuations—anonymous and non-anonymous subjects have nearly identical valuations. As a robustness check, we note <b>the</b> subjects across <b>conditions</b> give significantly different amounts in a dictator game, suggesting they were aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> and sensitive to the accompanying social pressures. Together, these findings strongly suggest subject familiarity with elicitation mechanisms, not anonymity, {{is responsible for the}} variability in results across value-elicitation experiments. As an application to experimental design methodology, there appears to be little need to impose anonymity in the laboratory when using second-price mechanisms as we see negligible differences in elicited values with and without anonymity...|$|R

While the rituals of entering and exiting the gym and 'building' the muscularity raise questions of men's reflected societal states in North America, the changing social appreciation of the 'new' body images, and emerging holistic approach of wellness of body-mind have become the thresholds to rethink the previously hyper-masculine gym space and to reinvent a way to accommodate these new conditions.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the interviewing methods in sample survey. The main topic {{deals with the}} analysis of the interviewers’ behaviour in selecting respondents in the light of theoretical principles and methodological directives. Methods of respondents’ selection in quota sampling and rules of interviewing have been worked out and tested in the western countries and in the USA in particular. One of the basic rules assumes that the interviewer is introduced to the respondent only in the role of a representative of a Research Institute. These rules have been accepted by Polish sociologists. It is important to know whether and to what extent methods worked out in different social and cultural conditions give satisfactory results also in Polish conditions. Polish Radio and Television Centre for Public Opinion Research and Programme Evaluation in Warsaw has a net of voluntary interviewers who select respondents (by means of quota sampling) in their own localities. Methodological instructions for the Centre interviewers are based on „imported” patterns to a certain extent adapted to polish conditions. Among other things the principle that the interviewer can only appear as a research worker is not strictly obeyed while interviews with the family and close acquaintances are not recommended. Methodological research carried out among the interviewers of the Polish Radio and Television Centre for Public Opinion Research and Programme Evaluation, whose results are presented in the paper, has shown that for interviewers acting in their own localities <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> mutual <b>anonymity</b> between respondent and interviewer is very difficult to be observed. The typology of contacts between interviewers and respondents has proved that the principle <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> is observed by less than a half of the interviewers and it happens mostly in bigger towns. Interviewers carrying out research in villages and small towns have a small chance to preserve their incognito usually being well known by the people from their own milieu. It was also stated that about 20 per cent of the interviewers consciously select acquaintances as their respondents. When cases in which people refused their permission to be interviewed were analysed, it appeared that <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> in which <b>the</b> interviewers of the Polish Radio and Television Centre work complete anonymity causes more difficulties in the research process and more frequent refusals than in those cases when the contacts between interviewers and respondents take place with their roles being well defined. From the above considerations there follows the conclusion that methodological principles in the organization of research by means of mass interviews should be adapted to <b>the</b> existing social <b>conditions</b> and circumstances in which the research takes place...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} influence of two social situational factors, anonymity and expected audience, on the expression of criticism and subsequent physiological and psychological response. The expression of criticism towards a disagreeable stranger was studied under the provision <b>of</b> either <b>anonymity</b> or no anonymity to the critic factorially combined with an expected audience for the criticism of either the person criticized (criticism-relevant expected audience), or someone who knew neither the critic or the person criticized (criticism-irrelevant expected audience). A series of hypotheses were derived from Zillman 2 ̆ 7 s (1972) two factor theory of aggressive responding concerning the expression of criticism and subsequent physiological and psychological response. In general, {{it was expected that}} criticism would be greatest, and subsequent physiological response least, when the critic was anonymous with a criticism-irrelevant expected audience. The opposite pattern of response was predicted for critics who were nonanonymous with a criticism-relevant expected audience. Subjects were 54 female students enrolled at a large urban university who were told that they were participating in a study concerned with the physiological and psychological correlates of critical thinking and expression. All subjects heard an audiotape of an obnoxious, though not personally insulting, confederate student at the same university. Two-thirds of the subjects were then randomly assigned to one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four treatment <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> or no anonymity with a criticism-relevant or irrelevant expected audience and asked to make a critical evaluation of the student. The remaining subjects were assigned to two control group conditions in which they did not criticize but were given an unrelated task involving verbalization. Forty-two subjects participated in a second session under <b>the</b> same treatment <b>condition</b> as <b>the</b> first session. Dependent measures consisted of an independently rated score for the criticalness of each subject 2 ̆ 7 s evaluation of the obnoxious student, frequency of skin resistance response (SRR), range-corrected skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate (HR), and responses to a postsession Self-Report Questionnaire which asked the subjects to rate themselves, the obnoxious student, and their criticism on various scales. Results indicated no differences in the expression of criticism or subsequent physiological response as a function <b>of</b> the <b>anonymity</b> and expected audience factors. However, significant differences were noted on the anonymity factor for items on the Self-Report Questionnaire. Anonymous subjects reported less dislike of the confederate student and greater feelings of restraint in criticizing than the nonanonymous subjects. All subjects who expressed criticism gave themselves significantly less positive self-evaluations than those who did not. Physiological responding on SRR and HR was also found to vary significantly in the second session prior to criticizing when subjects received instructions which identified <b>the</b> particular treatment <b>condition</b> to which they had been assigned. Subjects in the anonymous, criticism-irrelevant treatment group showed the greatest arousal while subjects in the nonanonymous, criticism-irrelevant group displayed the least. Results were discussed as reflecting an interaction between the potential threat of retaliation which subjects may have attributed to <b>the</b> various treatment <b>conditions,</b> and <b>the</b> social inappropriateness of expressing criticism towards a peer under <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> low provocation. Modifications to the design of the present study were suggested to overcome these problems...|$|R
