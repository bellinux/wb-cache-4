On the same occasion, he also made reference to the Iraqi elections, saying that the United States had manipulated the 2005 parliamentary election, changing the percentage of United Iraqi Alliance votes from 56% to 48%.|$|E
25|$|The {{prominence}} of failed prophecy also lends {{support to the}} cult theory. NESARA supporters often tell their readers that the NESARA announcement {{is going to happen}} in a matter of days. These claims have been made too many times to enumerate, without ever coming to fruition. According to the documentary Waiting For NESARA, the claim was also made prior to March 2003 <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> was planning the war with Iraq only to further delay the NESARA announcement. It was prophesied that spiritual beings and UFOs would intervene with Bush's plans and prevent the war.|$|E
25|$|His {{two main}} {{findings}} are that leaders actually do not lie {{very much to}} other countries, and that democratic leaders are actually more likely than autocrats to lie to their own people. Thus, he starts his book by {{saying that it is}} not surprising that Saddam Hussein did not lie about having WMD—he truthfully said he had none—but <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> and some of his key advisors did lie to the American people about the threat from Iraq. Mearsheimer argues that leaders are most likely to lie to their own people in democracies that fight wars of choice in distant places. He says that it is difficult for leaders to lie to other countries because there is not much trust among them, especially when security issues are at stake, and you need trust for lying to be effective. He says that it is easier for leaders to lie to their own people because there is usually a good deal of trust between them.|$|E

500|$|Because of {{his time}} in the Senate, Gravel was invited to many of the early Democratic presidential debates. During the initial one at South Carolina State University on April 26, 2007, he {{suggested}} a bill requiring the president to withdraw from Iraq on pain of criminal penalties. He also advocated positions such as opposing preemptive nuclear war. He stated that the Iraq War had the effect of creating more terrorists and that the [...] "war was lost the day <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> invaded Iraq on a fraudulent basis." [...] Regarding his fellow candidates, he said, [...] "I got to tell you, after standing up with them, some of these people frighten me – they frighten me." [...] Media stories said that Gravel was responsible for much of whatever [...] "heat" [...] and [...] "flashpoints" [...] had taken place. Gravel gained considerable publicity by shaking up the normally staid multiple-candidate format; The New York Times media critic said that what Gravel had done was [...] "steal a debate with outrageous, curmudgeonly statements." [...] The Internet was a benefit: a YouTube video of his responses in the debate was viewed more than 225,892 times, ranking seventeenth in most views for week and first among news and politics clips; his name became the fifteenth most searched-for in the blogosphere; and his website garnered more traffic than those of frontrunners Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, or John Edwards. Gravel appeared on the popular Colbert Report on television on May 2, and his campaign and career were profiled in national publications such as Salon. Two wordless, Warholesque campaign videos, [...] "Rock" [...] and [...] "Fire", were released on YouTube in late May and became hits, and eventually gained over 760,000 and 185,000 views respectively. [...] "Rock," [...] in turn, was given airtime during an episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Some thirty-five years after he first achieved the national spotlight, he had found it again.|$|E
