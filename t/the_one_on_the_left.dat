The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining {{the shadows of the}} robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.|$|E

[...] The purpose of the commission was to recognize the space exploration program.

2500|$|On the façade of the Loggia, {{below the}} parapet, are trefoils with allegorical {{figures of the}} four {{cardinal}} virtues (Fortitude, Temperance, Justice and Prudence) by Agnolo Gaddi.

The vault, composed of semicircles, was done by the Florentine Antonio de' Pucci. On the steps of the Loggia are the Medici lions; two Marzoccos, marble statues of lions, heraldic symbols of Florence; that on the right is from Roman times and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> was sculpted by Flaminio Vacca in 1598.

2500|$|The Faculty of Law became Faculty of Law and Economics when an {{economic}} department {{was introduced in}} 1905. In 1912, Otto Jaekel, a professor of paleontology in Greifswald, founded the German Paleontological Society. The Department of Modern Languages was established in 1853. To commemorate the 400th anniversary of the university 1456—1856, the [...] "Rubenow-Denkmal" [...] (Rubenow Memorial) was built {{in front of the}} main building, which is still there at its historic place. The Department of History was founded 1863 as the first in Prussia and the fourth in all of Germany. The painter Caspar David Friedrich was born in Greifswald and received his first painting instruction by one of the university's members. Today the Department of Fine Art and Art History is named after him. He later painted several oil paintings with motifs from the region, including <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Another {{division}} of space {{is using the}} concept of right or left space (seen from outside the front facade). The space {{on the right is}} considered masculine, while the left is feminine. The right side of the house, called the [...] "big (major) house floor" [...] (kaheli bokulu) is largely reserved for ritual and other public affairs conducted by men. The left side of the house is named the [...] "cool house floor" [...] (kaheli maringu); and is associated with female domestic activities, such as preparing a meal, dining, and sleeping (simple compartments for sleeping are built along the left wall). In the Sumbanese society, women are considered [...] "owners of houses" [...] (mangu umangu) because they spend more time at home than men. On the other hand, men are associated with the exterior and with external relation among clans as well as communication with the spiritual being. Similarly, the door on the right front is reserved for male access, while <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> rear is reserved for female access; each leading to a slightly lower verandah and to the exterior.|$|E

2500|$|The {{southeast}} panel {{illustrates the}} opening ritual when the principal participant is elaborately dressed {{and is being}} handed a bundle of spears. This {{is part of an}} initial activity before the game itself starts. Overlooking this scene is the death deity who rises from a vat of liquid, perhaps pulque. The glyphs above the deity identify it with the planet Venus. [...] Next is the southwest panel in which a different ceremonial preparation is depicted. The principal participant is supine on a kind of a sofa. Two musicians are playing a turtle shell drum and clay rattles. A figure dressed as an eagle dances in front while a skeletal deity flies above and the death deity rises from liquid. The northwest panel shows the beginning of the ballgame. Two participants are standing {{in the center of the}} court with speech scrolls emerging from their mouths. One holds a large knife in his left hand and gestures with his right. Between them are intertwined slashes, the symbol of the ballgame and a ball. At their waists are the protective and ritual accoutrements which are very similar to the stone yokes, palmas and hachas common in elite burials. Behind the players are two figures, one with a deer head, who are watching from the court walls as well as the death deity again above. The northeast panel indicates that the game has been played and one of the participants is about to be sacrificed by having his head cut off. The three figures are all dressed in the garments and symbols of the ballgame. The center figure has his arms held back by <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left.</b> The figure on the right holds a large knife which is at the center figure’s neck. [...] There are scrolls indicating speech from the sacrifice as well as a depiction of the skeletal god.|$|E
