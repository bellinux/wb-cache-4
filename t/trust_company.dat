5|$|As news spread, {{other banks}} and trust {{companies}} {{were reluctant to}} lend any money. The {{interest rates on loans}} to brokers at the stock exchange soared to 70% and, with brokers unable to get money, stock prices fell to a low not seen since December 1900. The panic quickly spread to two other large trusts, <b>Trust</b> <b>Company</b> of America and Lincoln <b>Trust</b> <b>Company.</b> By Thursday, October 24, a chain of failures littered the street: Twelfth Ward Bank, Empire City Savings Bank, Hamilton Bank of New York, First National Bank of Brooklyn, International <b>Trust</b> <b>Company</b> of New York, Williamsburg <b>Trust</b> <b>Company</b> of Brooklyn, Borough Bank of Brooklyn, Jenkins <b>Trust</b> <b>Company</b> of Brooklyn and the Union <b>Trust</b> <b>Company</b> of Providence.|$|E
5|$|By then, Morgan {{was drawn}} into another situation. There was deep {{concern that the}} <b>Trust</b> <b>Company</b> of America and the Lincoln Trust might fail to open on Monday due to {{continuing}} runs by depositors. On Saturday evening 40–50 bankers had gathered at the library to discuss the crisis, with the clearing-house bank presidents in the East room and the <b>trust</b> <b>company</b> executives in the West room. Morgan and those dealing with the Moore & Schley situation {{had moved to the}} librarian’s office. There Morgan told his counselors that he would agree to help shore up Moore & Schley only if the trust companies would work together to bail out their weakest brethren. The discussion among the bankers continued late into Saturday night but without much progress. Around midnight, J.P. Morgan informed a leader of the <b>trust</b> <b>company</b> presidents that keeping Moore & Schley afloat would require $25 million, and he would not commit those funds unless the problems with the trust companies could also be resolved. The <b>trust</b> <b>company</b> executives understood they would not receive further help from Morgan; they would have to finance any bailout of the two struggling trust companies.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the efficiency of selected conventional and Islamic unit <b>trust</b> <b>companies</b> in Malaysia during the period 2002 to 2005. Design/methodology/approach – The paper adopts Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to investigate efficiency, as measured by the Malmquist index, which is decomposed into two components: efficiency change and technical change indexes. Findings – The study indicates that technical efficiency is the main contributor to enhancing the efficiency of the Malaysian unit trust industry. In addition, the larger the size of the unit <b>trust</b> <b>companies,</b> the more inefficient the performance. In comparing the efficiency of unit <b>trust</b> <b>companies,</b> the study finds that some of the Islamic unit <b>trust</b> <b>companies</b> perform better than their conventional counterparts. Research limitations/implications – The study is limited to five Islamic unit <b>trust</b> <b>companies.</b> Thus, the findings of this study are indicative, but inconclusive for the unit trust industry as a whole. Practical implications – The results have two important implications for both conventional and Islamic unit <b>trust</b> <b>companies</b> in Malaysia. First, the deterioration of total factor productivity (TFP) in the unit trust industry in Malaysia is due to the deficiency of innovation in technical components. Second, the size of the unit <b>trust</b> <b>companies</b> has an adverse effect on the TFP performance. Originality/value – The contribution of this study is that it analyzes the efficiency of the two types of unit trust industry which are important and relevant for Malaysia. This significance arises from the dual financial system, in which the Islamic unit <b>trust</b> <b>companies</b> operate in parallel with their conventional counterparts. The comparison sheds some light on the performance of the Islamic unit <b>trust</b> <b>companies,</b> whose operations are based on profit-sharing, in contrast to the conventional unit <b>trust</b> <b>companies.</b> Capital markets, Economic performance, Indexing, Islam, Malaysia, Unit trusts...|$|R

5|$|At 3 a.m. about 120 {{bank and}} <b>trust</b> <b>company</b> {{officials}} assembled {{to hear a}} full report {{on the status of}} the failing trust companies. While the <b>Trust</b> <b>Company</b> of America was barely solvent, the Lincoln <b>Trust</b> <b>Company</b> was probably $1 million short of what it needed to cover depositor accounts. As discussion ensued, the bankers realized that Morgan had locked them in the library and pocketed the key to force a solution, the sort of strong-arm tactic he had been known to use in the past. Morgan then entered the talks and advised the trust companies they must provide a loan of $25 million to save the weaker institutions. The trust presidents were still reluctant to act, but Morgan informed them that if they did not it would lead to a complete collapse of the banking system. Through his considerable influence, at about 4:45a.m. he persuaded the unofficial leader of the trust companies to sign the agreement, and the remainder of the bankers followed. Having received these commitments, Morgan allowed the bankers to go home.|$|E
40|$|During the Panic of 1907, New York City <b>trust</b> <b>companies</b> {{were not}} members of the New York Clearinghouse whereas <b>trust</b> <b>companies</b> in Chicago {{were members of the}} Chicago Clearinghouse. We argue that the {{apparent}} isolation of New York City <b>trust</b> <b>companies</b> from the pool of bank reserves controlled by the New York Clearinghouse led to the large-scale depositor runs on the New York City trusts. In contrast, Chicago <b>trust</b> <b>companies</b> had direct access to the Chicago Clearinghouse and their pool of reserves and did not suffer large-scale depositor withdrawals. Statistical evidence on a cross-section of intermediaries in both New York and Chicago supports this contention.

5|$|As a run {{began on}} the <b>Trust</b> <b>Company</b> of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to {{liquidate}} the company's assets to allow the bank to pay depositors. The bank survived to the close of business, but Morgan knew that additional money {{would be needed to}} keep it solvent through the following day. That night he assembled the presidents of the other trust companies and held them in a meeting until midnight when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the <b>Trust</b> <b>Company</b> of America to stay open the next day. On Thursday morning Cortelyou deposited around $25 million into a number of New York banks. John D. Rockefeller, the wealthiest man in the United States, deposited a further $10 million in Stillman's National City Bank. Rockefeller's massive deposit left the National City Bank with the deepest reserves of any bank in the city. To instill public confidence, Rockefeller phoned Melville Stone, the manager of the Associated Press, and told him that he would pledge half of his wealth to maintain U.S. credit.|$|E
