5|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{has been}} threatened by erosion for decades. In the 1930s, {{as a response}} to the erosion, a breakwater was constructed to protect the boat landing area. In 1996, the Connecticut <b>Trust</b> <b>for</b> <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> and the National <b>Trust</b> <b>for</b> <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> assisted the task of obtaining funding for a $4.5 million erosion-control project. The funds were approved in 1998 with the help of Connecticut Senators, Joseph Lieberman and Christopher Dodd and New Haven's Congressional Representative Rosa DeLauro. In 2001, the construction of a stone wall and creation of a buffer zone was completed. The second phase of the project calls for protective revetment on the south side of the island.|$|E

5000|$|The City of West Palm Beach, {{following}} a {{purchase of the}} building in 1988, tapped local architecture firm Oliver Glidden & Partners to head a 4.3 million dollar restoration of the structure. The project was completed and the station rededicated in a ceremony attended by the Florida Governor in April 1991. Architect Robert D. Brown directed the restoration of ornamental cast stone elements, exterior masonry, doors, windows, and iron and tile work. The red clay tile roof was replaced, as were the electrical, lighting, plumbing and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. Abatement of lead and asbestos was further required to bring the historic structure up to modern building code standards. The restoration effort earned the Florida <b>Trust</b> Award <b>for</b> <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> in 1994.|$|R
5|$|In November 2007, the Pui Tak Center won a $100,000 {{grant from}} the Partners in Preservation, a program {{sponsored}} by American Express and the National <b>Trust</b> <b>for</b> <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation.</b> Spreading the word via e-mail, Facebook, and church sermons, the building led the five-week-long online contest from the start and ultimately received 14% of the vote. It received more votes {{than any of the}} other 24 historic Chicago sites participating in the contest, including the Robie House, the Chicago Cultural Center, and Unity Temple.|$|E
5|$|Time has {{undergone}} several restorations because of deterioration and decline caused by natural and urban elements. During the late 1990s {{and the first}} few years of the 21st century it underwent repairs that corrected many of the problems caused by these earlier restorations. Although extensive renovation of the sculpture was completed as recently as 2005, the supporters of Time continue to seek resources for additional lighting, and the National <b>Trust</b> <b>for</b> <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> has nominated it for further funding.|$|E

Restoration work began in spring 2009 and is scheduled for completion in early 2010. Fully restoring the building's exterior terra cotta pieces and clay roof tiles {{is the first step in}} a long-range $2million repair plan.|$|E

5|$|In April 2007, the leaking {{roof was}} repaired. In December 2007, the House {{received}} a $28,500 {{grant from the}} Dr. Scholl Foundation. The grant was used to complete lead-paint abatement, which would make conducting other restoration work safer. By 2010, the Dr. Scholl Foundation granted another $50,000 and a family foundation provided another $50,000 for the restoration. It was reported that other college grants totaling $15,500 were given for preservation planning, {{in part by the}} Connecticut <b>Trust</b> <b>for</b> <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation.</b> It was reported in May 2010 that a matching grant of $101,500 was given to Connecticut College from the Connecticut Commission on Culture and Tourism, which provided the funding for the next phase of renovations for restoring the House.|$|E
5|$|For most of {{its history}} the National Register has been {{administered}} by the National Park Service (NPS), an agency within the United States Department of the Interior. Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups, such as the National <b>Trust</b> <b>for</b> <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation,</b> coordinate, identify, and protect historic sites in the United States. While National Register listings are mostly symbolic, their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties. Protection of the property is not guaranteed. During the nomination process, the property is evaluated {{in terms of the}} four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. The application of those criteria {{has been the subject of}} criticism by academics of history and preservation, as well as the public and politicians.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Koubek {{was hired}} to help {{renovate}} the long-shuttered, historic Willard Hotel. The original hotel (consisting of six townhouses joined together) was built in 1816, renovated and enlarged by leaseholder Henry Willard in 1847, and the current 12-story structure erected in 1901. Due to mismanagement and competition from more modern hotels, the Willard closed in 1968. With the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue in the 1960s and 1970s, the Willard was threatened repeatedly with demolition. In May 1974, the National <b>Trust</b> <b>for</b> <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> paid Koubek $25,000 to study saving the hotel, either as a hotel, as a mixed-used structure, or as an office building. The Willard's owners, Charles Benenson and Robert Arnow, had earlier commissioned Koubek to design a modern office building for the site which would have required demolition of the structure.|$|E

5|$|A second noted {{house in}} the Dupont Circle {{neighborhood}} which is claimed to be haunted is the Woodrow Wilson House (2340 S Street NW). Woodrow Wilson was elected President of the United States in 1912, was re-elected in 1916 promising to keep the nation out of war, led the nation through World War I, and left office in 1921. At 2 AM on September 26, 1919, while traveling to Wichita, Kansas, on a nationwide speaking tour to win public support to pressure the Senate into ratifying the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson collapsed and, after cancelling {{the rest of his}} speaking tour, was rushed back to the capital by train. His condition worsened on the journey, and upon arriving at the White House on October 2 the President suffered a life-threatening stroke that left him permanently paralyzed on his left side and blind in the left eye. Although the President lived, he was confined to bed for two months, seen only by his wife, a few close associates, and his physicians. From December 1919 to April 1920 Wilson required a wheelchair. Wilson attended his first Cabinet meeting in April 1920, {{but for the rest of}} the year his mind continued to wander, his memory was marred, and he tired easily. By March 1921 (when he left office) Wilson was able to walk short distances with the use of a cane (and with a valet close at hand). The extent of Wilson's disability was kept from the public until after his death on February 3, 1924. President and Mrs. Wilson purchased a large home at 2340 S Street NW, to which a number of modifications were made (including the addition of an elevator). Woodrow Wilson received few guests in his last years, and died in his third floor bedroom on February 3, 1924. His wife, Edith Bolling Galt Wilson, lived in the home until her death on December 28, 1961, and willed the home to the National <b>Trust</b> <b>for</b> <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> to be made into a museum honoring her husband. In the decades since her death, staff and visitors at the Woodrow Wilson House claim to have seen the President's ghost sitting in his rocking chair, heard the shuffle of a man walking with a cane, and heard a man sob.|$|E

40|$|Budget cuts <b>for</b> <b>historic</b> <b>preservation</b> {{and other}} {{humanities}} based projects are occurring on the federal, state, and local levels. Funding sources that historically supported {{these types of}} projects are being scaled back and eliminated.

It is, therefore, imperative that funding sources are identified and solicited if current preservation efforts are to continue.
