5|$|In 1932, Pflueger renovated the Nasser brother's New Mission Theater, {{bringing}} Art Deco stylings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> {{in contrast}} to the Spanish Mission trimmings in the main auditorium. In 1993, the theater closed. The theater, now designated San Francisco Landmark No. 245, was purchased by Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas and completely renovated to its original splendor, opening its doors once again to patrons in December 2015. Pflueger simultaneously worked on the remodeling of the Nasser's New Fillmore Theater, a sister design similar in many respects. The New Fillmore closed in 1957 and was demolished to make way for an urban redevelopment project.|$|E
5|$|On February 23, 1991, {{at about}} 8:23 PM, a fire {{began on the}} 22nd floor of the {{building}}. It was a Saturday night and {{there were only three}} people in the building at the time, an engineer and two security guards. Workers had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office earlier in the day and workers left a pile of rags soaked in linseed oil on the floor. The linseed oil oxidized and generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then set fire to other solvents nearby. Smoke detectors did not cover the entire floor {{and by the time the}} fire alarm went off the fire was already well established. After the fire alarm sounded in the building the engineer went up to the 22nd floor to investigate. When the elevator reached the 22nd floor the engineer found heavy smoke and heat that prevented him from reaching the elevator controls he needed to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby.</b> The engineer escaped after radioing to a security guard in the lobby to recall the elevator using fire safety controls there. The second security guard was on the 30th floor when the alarm went off and used the stairwell to get to the ground floor.|$|E

25|$|After 1868 the {{building}} continued to evolve, stucco {{was added to}} the stone walls in the 1880s and seventy years later wrought iron grill work {{was added to the}} balconies and porches.

25|$|The Green – Wyatt {{building}} {{was constructed in}} the 1970s by Hoffman Construction Company under a $20 million contract. The new building opened in 1975. On June 21, 1989, an arson fire in the lobby caused $300,000 in damages, mostly from the sprinkler system that kept the night-time fire contained <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> area. Firefighters returned in February {{of the next year}} when a person trapped in an elevator inadvertently set off the fire alarm. Also that year, the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service moved out of the building and into Oregon’s World Trade Center.|$|E
25|$|The Mohegan Sun Arena {{is located}} {{in the center of the}} mall area of the Mohegan Sun Casino. Due to this placement, Sun fans take {{advantage}} of the restaurants, shops and other destinations in the casino before and after games. Frequently, Sun and opposing players can be found eating in restaurants after games. Opposing teams stay in the hotel at the casino and are often seen walking from the arena <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby.</b> All members of the Sun organization are considered employees of the casino, and as such, are unable to partake in any of the games of chance offered there.|$|E

25|$|Some {{people in}} the dress circle, {{familiar}} with the theatre, tried to avail themselves of the other exit leading into Flood's Alley, near the corner of Johnson Street. Patrons in the first rush down the stairs found the door locked; no usher was in sight. In the brief time it took them {{to discover that the}} door was locked and return to the dress circle, the stage had become engulfed and they had no recourse but to attempt to work their way down the main dress circle stairs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby,</b> adding their numbers to the crush on those stairs. Fire Marshall Keady would later write that he never found evidence that the exit had been opened.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, the {{department}} moved to Green Hall; a room located next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> {{in the first}} floor served as {{the department}}'s academic library. In 1968, two more rooms were added to house monographs and journal stacks. In 1990, the third journal room was moved into the basement to accommodate compact shelving. The , a branch of Princeton University Library, underwent significant renovations in 2002. The basement room was no longer used because the library gained a Reading Room, {{which has become a}} popular study space for psychology concentrators. A ramp that leads to the second room was built to ease the reshelving of materials. A librarian’s office was built next to one of the computer clusters.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the facility is above ground. The only part that is underground is a subterranean corridor that links cellblocks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby.</b> Inmates spend 23 hours a day locked in their cells and are escorted by {{a minimum of three}} officers for their five hours of private recreation per week. Each cell has a desk, a stool, and a bed, which are almost entirely made out of poured concrete, as well as a toilet that shuts off if blocked, a shower that runs on a timer to prevent flooding, and a sink lacking a potentially dangerous tap. Rooms may also be fitted with polished steel mirrors bolted to the wall, an electric light that can be shut off only remotely, a radio, and on rare occasions, a black-and-white television that shows recreational, educational, and religious programming. In addition, all cells are soundproofed to prevent prisoners from communicating with each other via Morse code.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} policy {{reform in}} a model {{in which there are}} both rent seeking and lobbying activities. These two activities involve similar skills, so a reform which reduces rents will cause a shift into lobbying. Also, lobbying is subject to a free-rider problem, so <b>the</b> marginal return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> industry from <b>lobbying</b> may greatly exceed an individual firm’s return <b>to</b> <b>lobbying.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> shift into <b>lobbying</b> which results from a reduction in available rents may lead to a large increase in transfers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> industry. Under some circumstances, it is possible for a reform which reduces available rents <b>to</b> increase <b>the</b> total of rents plus transfers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> industry...|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, many Congressional Democrats took up {{the cause}} of the Central American refugees—due in large part <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> and {{publicity}} efforts of Sanctuary members. In 1990, the House and Senate approved a bill granting temporary protected status (TPS) to Central Americans in need of safe haven, but not until the 1997 Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act did Congress allow fleeing Central Americans to apply for permanent residence.|$|R

25|$|The Metropolitan Theater façade {{resembles a}} stage being {{framed by a}} proscenium-like central window of stained glass which carries the name “Metropolitan” with flora and fauna motif {{surrounding}} the label. This helps bring in light <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby.</b> It was highlighted on both ends by the curving walls with colorful decorated tiles in resemblance with the batik patterns from Southeast Asia. There are also moldings of zigzag and wavy lines that go with the sponged and painted multi-colored massive walls. The wall that framed the stained glass is a segmented arch with rows of small finials on the upper edge of the wall. Angkor Wat-inspired minarets crown {{the top of the}} concave roof which suggested its status as a theater back in its prime days. Located in the entrance are elaborate wrought iron gates which are patterned into leaf designs and various lines. Accenting the ground level are Capiz lamps and banana-leaf formed pillars which go alternately with the theater’s entrances.|$|E
25|$|Equitable {{sold the}} {{building}} in 1946 to the Flatiron Associates, an investor group headed by Harry Helmsley, whose firm, Dwight-Helmsley (which would later become Helmsley-Spear) managed the property. The new owners made some superficial changes, such as adding a dropped ceiling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby,</b> and, later, replacing the original mahogony-panelled entrances with revolving doors. Because the ownership structure was a tenancy-in-common, in which all partners have to agree on any action, {{as opposed to a}} straightforward partnership, it was difficult to get permission for necessary repairs and improvements to be done, and the building declined during the Helmsley/Flatiron Associates era. Helmsley-Spear stopped managing {{the building in}} 1997, when some of the investors sold their 52% of the building to Newmark Knight-Frank, a large real estate firm, which took over management of the property. Shortly afterwards, Helmsley's widow, Leona Helmsley, sold her share as well. Newmark made significant improvements to the property, including installing new electric elevators, replacing the antiquated hydraulic ones.|$|E
25|$|Built in 1939, {{and named}} for renowned actor Richard B. Harrison, who taught Drama and {{directed}} productions at the college; Harrison Auditorium {{was designed by}} architect Leon McMinn. The auditorium was constructed by the Public Works Administration for usage as the college's main auditorium. The flat-roofed two story building features seven-bay main entrance with the bays defined by plain brick pilasters with simply molded stone bases and capitals. Extending above the pilasters is a plain stone frieze inscribed with the auditorium's name. Five pairs of glass and wood doors topped by five-light transoms give access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby.</b> Above each entry door at the second story level are large twelve-over-twelve sash windows. The roof line steps up {{at the rear of}} the lobby/entrance portion of the building to provide additional height to the main, large auditorium portion of the building. In 2004, the building underwent a two-year renovation process that involved both the interior and exterior of the building. The nearly $3 million renovation repaired the building's exterior surfaces, upgraded building systems, replaced seating, and made the building compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act.|$|E
500|$|Among Wright's most {{significant}} alterations was {{the addition of}} white marble with Persian-style ornamentation.

To a small open economy the authors graft a government price-setting program that responds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> pressure of opposing interests. The proof involves reformulating <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> economy as a noncooperative generalized game, establishing {{the existence of an}} equilibrium in the economy.

25|$|On June 5, 1946, a fire {{broke out}} in the hotel, killing 61 people, many of them children. The fire began in the Silver Grill Cocktail Lounge on the lower floor on the La Salle Street side {{adjacent}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> before ascending stairwells and shafts The fire started either in the walls or in the ceiling according to the Chicago Fire Department around 12:15a.m. but they did not receive their first notification of the fire until 12:35a.m. The fire quickly spread through the highly-varnished wood paneling in the lounge and the mezzanine balcony overlooking the lobby. While a significant number died from flames, a greater number of deaths were caused by suffocation from the thick, black smoke. Around 900 guests were able to leave the building but some 150 had to be rescued by the fire services and by heroic members of the public, including two sailors who were reported to have rescued 27 people between them. Two-thirds of hotel fire deaths in 1946 occurred in the La Salle and Winecoff (Atlanta) fires. The hotel fire was so devastating, it resulted in the Chicago city council enacting new hotel building codes and fire-fighting procedures, including the installation of automatic alarm systems and instructions of fire safety inside the hotel rooms.|$|E
25|$|After {{flashing}} over in {{the ballroom}} (which witnesses confused with an explosion), the super-heated gases swept up the grand staircase into {{the lobby of the}} hotel. From there, the fire was drawn through the open doors of the casino by the smoke-eaters (devices in the ceiling that sucked the smoke from cigarettes out of the room) present throughout the casino. With more than 150 guests estimated to be in the casino when the fire broke out, most of the deaths occurred in that area. Several months before the fire, hotel management had had the emergency exit doors locked to prevent theft, and the only other way out was through a pair of inward-opening doors. Some people pressed against the doors to no avail. Others leaped from the second-story casino through plate-glass windows to the pool deck below; many were injured. Others died of smoke inhalation on upper floors of the casino. Still others were killed as they rode the elevators <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby,</b> only to discover their path blocked by the fire when the doors opened. Those who were able to do so climbed to the hotel's roof, where an improvised helicopter rescue, including civilian, Commonwealth Police, Puerto Rico National Guard, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Navy helicopters from the Roosevelt Roads Naval Air Station, transported people to safety.|$|E
25|$|Zionists {{launched}} an intense White House lobby {{to have the}} UNSCOP plan endorsed, and the effects were not trivial. The Democratic Party, {{a large part of}} whose contributions came from Jews, informed Truman that failure to live up to promises to support the Jews in Palestine would constitute a danger to the party. The defection of Jewish votes in congressional elections in 1946 had contributed to electoral losses. Truman was, according to Roger Cohen, embittered by feelings of being a hostage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> and its 'unwarranted interference', which he blamed for the contemporary impasse. When a formal American declaration in favour of partition was given on 11 October, a public relations authority declared to the Zionist Emergency Council in a closed meeting:'under no circumstances should any of us believe or think we had won because of the devotion of the American Government to our cause. We had won because of the sheer pressure of political logistics that was applied by the Jewish leadership in the United States'. State Department advice critical of the controversial UNSCOP recommendation to give the overwhelmingly Arab town of Jaffa, and the Negev, to the Jews was overturned by an urgent and secret late meeting organized for Chaim Weizman with Truman, which immediately countermanded the recommendation. The United States initially refrained from pressuring smaller states to vote either way, but Robert A. Lovett reported that America's U.N. delegation's case suffered impediments from high pressure by Jewish groups, and that indications existed that bribes and threats were being used, even of American sanctions against Liberia and Nicaragua. When the UNSCOP plan failed to achieve the necessary majority on 25 November, the lobby 'moved into high gear' and induced the President to overrule the State Department, and let wavering governments know that the U.S. strongly desired partition.|$|E

500|$|The growing {{popularity}} of art museums presented unique challenges to the architecture. Mellon and Pei both expected large crowds of people to visit the new building, and they planned accordingly. To this end, he designed a large lobby roofed with enormous skylights.

A large mobile sculpture by American artist Alexander Calder was later added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby.</b> Pei hoped the lobby would be exciting {{to the public in}} the same way as the central room of the Guggenheim Museum in New York.
