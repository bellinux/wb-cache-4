Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Research was done to determine the effect of moisture on the <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> strength and the interfacial shear strength of a glass/epoxy composite. Specimens with two different fiber sizings, one epoxy compatible and one vinyl-ester compatible, were immersed in distilled water to give a saturation level of moisture absorption. Both aged and unaged samples were tested in two different ways. A new procedure was developed to perform <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>tests</b> of laminate composites in an electron microscope. Using this technique, one can directly observe the failure scenario. Results were analyzed to see if moisture modifies the failure scenario or the ply stress levels at which damage initiates and propagates. Also, micro-indentation tests were done to measure interfacial shear strength. Micro-Indentation results show that the system with the incompatible sizing had a lower interfacial shear strength than the system with the epoxy-compatible sizing. The critical shear interfacial shear stress of both systems was decreased by moisture absorption; however, the weaker interface showed twice as much degradation due to moisture. The decrease in the epoxy compatible system can be explained by changes in residual stresses. However, the decrease in the system with the incompatible sizing is probably due to changes in the residual stresses plus some degradation of the interface. The <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>tests</b> also showed that the system with the incompatible sizing was weaker. Both systems showed little degradation due to moisture absorption. The slight decrease in the critical stress to cause transverse cracking could be explained by relaxation of thermal residual stresses by the absorbed moisture. Insitu observations show that almost all of the failure occurred by debonding at the fiber/matrix interface at heterogeneities in the microstructure which coalesced into transverse cracks...|$|R

The configuration used in Nd:YAG laser brazing was an overlap one with the aluminium placed upon steel. Two brazing modes were studied, in the first one the joints were obtained between steel and aluminium alloys by reactive wetting whereas in the second mode an aluminium-silicium filler alloy was employed. For TIG brazing the arc was diriged toward steel in a lap configuration where the aluminium was placed upon steel. In the first mode, the brazed joints were realized without filler metal {{and in the second}} mode, the influence of silicium, zinc and nickel were studied in powder shape. The joints were observed by optical microscope and scanning electronic microscope. The phase composition was characterized by energy dispersive X-rays and the microhardness was obtained by Vickers hardness test. Two mechanical test were used to characterize fracture strengths of the assemblies. The first one was a <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> which stressed the interfaces in shearing mode, the second test used was a “tearing off test” which stretched the interfaces in tensile mode. The first results obtained show that that the use of an aluminium-silicium filler reduced the reaction layer thickness for interfaces formed by laser brazing. In the case of reaction layers obtained by TIG brazing, the use of silicium showed a change in morphology with a reduced thickness of the reaction layers. The use of nickel seemed to lower the layer thickness. The fracture strengths of the joints obtained between steel and aluminium without filler metal measured with the <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> were about 180 N. mm- 1 for the joints brazed by laser process and about 140 N. mm- 1 for the joints obtained by TIG brazing...|$|E

40|$|Plastic {{deformation}} in irradiated zirconium alloys {{occurs in}} a very heterogeneous manner at the grain scale by the clearing up of radiation-induced prismatic loops by gliding dislocations and the channeling of these dislocations inside narrow bands of the grain. A statistical TEM investigation of this mechanism has been performed on neutron irradiated recrystallized Zr alloys tested at 350 degreesC. Due to the strong anisotropy of plastic deformation, different loading conditions have been investigated. It is shown that for <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>tests</b> and closed end burst tests, only basal channels are observed, whereas for axial <b>tensile</b> <b>tests,</b> prismatic and pyramidal channels are observed.

Good interfacial bonding (or adhesion), to ensure load transfer from matrix to reinforcement, is a primary requirement for effective use of reinforcement properties. Thus, a fundamental understanding of interfacial properties and a quantitative characterization of interfacial adhesion strength can help in evaluating the mechanical behavior and capabilities of composite materials. A large number of analytical techniques have been developed for understanding interfacial adhesion of glass fiber reinforced polymers.

Their complex fiber architecture and large unit cell size present challenges in both understanding deformation processes and measuring reliable material properties. This report examines composites made using flattened 12 k and 24 k standard modulus carbon fiber yarns in a 0 /+ 60 /- 60 triaxial braid architecture. Standard straight-sided tensile coupons are tested with the 0 axial braid fibers either parallel with or perpendicular to the applied tensile load (axial or <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>test,</b> respectively). Nonuniform surface strain resulting from the triaxial braid architecture is examined using photogrammetry. Local regions of high strain concentration are examined to identify where failure initiates and to determine the local strain {{at the time of}} initiation. Splitting within fiber bundles is the first failure mode observed at low to intermediate strains. For axial tensile tests splitting is primarily in the 60 bias fibers, which were oriented 60 to the applied load. At higher strains, out-of-plane deformation associated with localized delamination between fiber bundles or damage within fiber bundles is observed. For transverse tensile tests, the splitting is primarily in the 0 axial fibers, which were oriented transverse to the applied load. The initiation and accumulation of local damage causes the global transverse stress-strain curves to become nonlinear and causes failure to occur at a reduced ultimate strain.

Applying YBCO coated conductors to the power electric devices such as transformer, cable, motors, reduction of AC loss for long wire is necessary. Multifilamentation, {{which is one of the}} effective approaches for AC loss reduction, has been developed by the scribing process. YBCO coated conductors produced by our standard TFA-MOD process delaminated into two parts by the laser scribing. The delamination was clarified to occur within the superconducting layer caused by the defects such as pores in the superconducting layer. In order to reduce the defects in the superconducting layer, we modify the heat treatment profile performed on the decomposed precursor films by applying the interim annealing(550 - 600 °C) before crystallization heat treatment(740 - 770 °C). The interim annealed samples had much less and smaller pores than the standard processed ones.

However, LWBs should be considered heterogeneous in structure. The acquired engineering stress-strain curve is therefore unable to represent the tensile behavior of the aluminum LWBs in realistic situations, {{particularly with regard to}} the behavior of the weldment. This article presents a novel experimental approach to acquire true stress-strain data on the weldment during the tensile test of LWBs using a real-time microscopic recording system. This new approach will study observations of the real-time deformation of the laser-marked microgrids premade {{on the surface of the}} weldment of the LWB. By capturing the deformation of microgrids through the aid of a video encoder and transferring the data for measurement, the localized strains of the weldment can then be computed, and the localized stresses obtained accordingly.

40|$|The {{major theme}} of this {{dissertation}} is structure/property relationships in fiber-reinforced thermoplastic-matrix composites. Effort {{has been focused on}} the interface: interfacial crystallization and fiber/matrix adhesion. Included are investigations on interfacial nucleation and morphology, measurement of fiber/matrix adhesion, effects of interfacial adsorption and crystallization on fiber/matrix adhesion, and composites reinforced with thermotropic liquid crystal copolyester fibers. ^ Crystallization of a copolyester and poly(butylene terephthalate) with glass, carbon, or aramid fibers has been studied with regard to interfacial mophology. Techniques employed included hot-stage optical microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Nucleation by the fibers was found to be a general phenomenon. Morphology could be varied by changing the cooling rate. ^ In order to better monitor fiber/matrix adhesion, a buckled plate test has been developed. The test measures transverse toughness as the parameter characterizing interfacial adhesion in unidirectional, continuous-fiber composites. The test is simple to perform yet has advantages over other interfacial evaluation techniques. The buckled plate test was found to be a sensitive measure of fiber/matrix adhesion. ^ The buckled plate test has been used along with the <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> to examine how interfacial adsorption and crystallization affect fiber/matrix adhesion in polycarbonate/carbon fiber composites. Adsorption was found to be of primary importance in developing adhesion, while crystallization is a secondary effect. The toughness data have been fit successfully for annealing time and temperature dependence. The dependence of adsorption and transverse toughness on matrix molecular weight was found to be large, with higher molecular weights adsorbing more effectively. ^ Studies of the fiber/matrix interface have been extended to composites reinforced with thermotropic liquid crystal copolyester fibers. Composites made with these fibers had poor transverse properties, regardless of matrix. Surface treatment such as ozonation increased transverse properties, but values were still low. Scanning electron micrographs of fracture surfaces indicated that fiber splitting occurs, especially for surface treated fibers.

From these studies a reference fabrication procedure for GCRE fuel elements was established. The fuel element core contains minus 100 plus 200 -mesh hydrothermal UO/sub 2 / dispersed in an 18 - 14 - 2. 5 alloy matrix prepared from minus 325 -mesh elemental iron, chromium, nickel, and molybdenum powders. Commercial Type 318 stainless steel is used for cladding. Core compacts are sintered in steps to 2300 deg F after cold compacting at 15 tsi. Evacuated picture-frame packs are hot rolled from a hydrogen muffle at 2200 deg F with a 40 % reduction in thickness on the first pass and a 20 % reduction in thickness on remaining passes. After annealing at 2300 deg F, the fuel elements are given a light pickle and cold reduced 15 to 20 % in thickness to give a total reduction of 8 to 1.

40|$|Abstract. Due to size {{limits in}} the <b>transverse</b> direction, <b>tensile</b> <b>testing</b> is not {{appropriate}} to investigate the mechanical properties of elytra cuticle of the dung beetle (Copris ochus Motschulsky). However, nanoindentation testing can determine a material’s anisotropic properties through a single indentation. In the present study, nanoindentation stress–strain curves were used to characterize the complete mechanical behavior of dung beetle elytra cuticle. A differential constitutive equation has been developed with time-dependent spring constants k and viscosities η. To describe the complex viscoelastic behavior of dung beetle cuticle, a descriptive representation of the linear viscoelasticity law for the multilayer matrix has been formulated. A qualitative model {{for the relationship between}} cuticle structure and mechanical properties of elytra may help develop bionic composite materials for micro-aircraft, bionic tribology, bionic medical apparatus, and bionic organs (tissue engineering) ...|$|R

Evaluation of their weldability included equivalent energy fracture toughness <b>tests,</b> <b>transverse</b> weld <b>tensile</b> <b>tests</b> at - 196 and 25 C, and weld crack sensitivity tests. The Fe- 12 Ni- 0. 25 Ti alloy proved extremely weldable for cryogenic applications, having weld and heat affected zone properties comparable to those of the wrought base alloy. The Fe- 12 Ni- 0. 5 Al alloy had good weld properties only after the weld joint was heat treated. The Fe- 12 Ni- 0. 25 Nb alloy was not considered weldable for cryogenic use because of its poor weld joint properties at - 196 C and its susceptibility to hot cracking...|$|R
40|$|For angleply composites, lamina {{tension and}} {{compression}} strengths are commonly determined by applying classical lamination theory to test {{data obtained from}} testing of angleply composite specimens. For textile composites such as 2 D triaxial braids, analysis is more complex and standard test methods do not always yield reliable strength measurements. This paper describes recent research focused on development of more reliable tensile test methods for braided composites and presents preliminary data for various approaches. The materials investigated in this work have 0 deg+/- 60 2 D triaxial braid architecture with nearly equal fiber volume fraction {{in each of the}} three fiber directions. Flat composite panels are fabricated by resin transfer molding (RTM) using six layers of the braided preform aligned along the 0 deg fiber direction. Various epoxy resins are used as matrix materials. Single layer panels are also fabricated in order to examine local variations in deformation related to the braid architecture. Specimens are cut from these panels in the shape of standard straight-sided coupons, an alternative bowtie geometry, and an alternative notched geometry. Axial tensile properties are measured using specimens loaded along the 0 deg fiber direction. Transverse tensile properties are measured using specimens loaded perpendicular to the 0 deg fibers. Composite tubes are also fabricated by RTM. These tubes are tested by internal pressurization using a soft rubbery material sealed between the inside diameter of the tube and the load fixtures. The ends of the tube are unconstrained, so the primary load is in the hoop direction. Tubes are fabricated with the 0 deg fibers aligned along the tube axis by overbraiding the preform on a mandrel. Since the loading is in the hoop direction, testing of the overbraided tube provides a measure of transverse tensile strength. Previous work has indicated that straight-sided coupons yield a transverse tensile strength that is much lower than the expected material strength because of premature edge-initiated failure. Full-field strain measured during transverse tensile tests clearly showed accumulation of edge damage prior to failure. In the current work, high speed video and testing of single layer specimens are used to investigate potential failure mechanisms in more detail. High speed video clearly shows the edge initiation in six layer <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> coupons. Specimens with the bowtie geometry and the notched geometry minimize this edge effect and yield significantly higher transverse tensile strength values compared to the straight-sided coupons. However, bowtie and notched specimens geometries are not ideal because of the non-uniform stress and strain fields in the region of failure. Testing of tubes using internal pressurization eliminates edge-initiated failure and provides a more uniform state of stress and strain. Preliminary results indicate that bowtie, notched, and tube specimens yield comparable values for transverse tensile strength and that these values are much higher than the strength measured using a straight-sided coupon...|$|E
40|$|In hollow {{aluminium}} extrusions {{produced with}} porthole dies, longitudinal weld-seams are present {{throughout the entire}} extruded length, due to rejoining of metal streams inside the extrusion tooling. These weld-seams, formed by a solid-state bonding process at elevated temperatures and under conditions of interfacial pressure and plastic deformation, are commonly the weakest areas in the extrusion cross-section. Therefore, predictive control of the weld-seam formation process is essential. For this purpose a conceptual model is developed, containing all relevant features pertaining to the solid-state bonding process as this occurs in aluminium extrusion. This paper describes an experimental programme aimed at exploring the effects of tooling geometry, process conditions and alloy composition on weld-seam performance. In lab-scale experiments, strips were extruded from AA 6060 and AA 6082 billets, using tooling geometries in which a bridge was incorporated to form a weld-seam. Keeping the profile geometry constant, the internal geometry of the tooling was varied, resulting in different bonding conditions. The obtained weld-seams were characterised by means of <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>tests.</b> Associated microstructural characterisation of the extrusions and inspection of fracture surfaces was performed in order to relate the mechanical performance to microstructural features. The results clearly show that the evolutionary microstructural response of the alloy, determined by the local thermomechanical conditions inside the die, has {{a significant effect on}} the weld-seam performance. It is therefore concluded that, besides a criterion for suitable flow conditions and interfacial pressure, a predictive tool for weld-seam quality must incorporate the evolutionary microstructural response of the alloy in question...|$|R

40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels (DSS) as alternatives to conventional austenitic {{stainless steels}} {{for the construction of}} pipelines is becoming more wide-spread, particularly for sour service applications where corrosion resistance / stress corrosion cracking resistance is required in aggressive chloride / sulphide environments. While these steels show many superior characteristics, limitations are associated with the welding of these steels, particularly controlling the weld structure and properties and understanding how the weld metallurgy may influence the susceptibility to intergranular corrosion (IGC). The focus {{of this paper is to}} report on the findings from a detailed study of the various weld sections within a DSS pipeline, as a function of heat input and type of weld, in terms of the metallurgical structure, composition and mechanical properties and to assess the susceptibility to IGC. Welding was performed using the manual Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) technique at both high and low heat input conditions. Two different join configurations (double bevel single V bevel and double bevel single U joint configuration) were adopted. Structural analysis consisted of (i) optical microscopy of welded specimens; (ii) ferrite content determination; (iii) Vickers hardness measurements; (iv) Charpy impact studies and (v) <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>testing.</b> Two test methods namely a modified ASTM A 262 and a modified Double Loop Electrochemical Potentiokinetic Reactivation (DL-ERP) test was used to determine susceptibility to IGC. The electrolyte solution used was 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 + 0. 001 M TA (thioacetamide). The test was conducted at 60 ºC. The potential was scanned from - 500 mV (SCE) to + 200 mV (SCE) and back to - 500 mV (SCE) at a rate of 1. 67 mV/s. The ratio of the reactivation charge to the passivation charge was calculated.

40|$|Natural fibres {{have emerged}} as {{potential}} reinforcement materials for composite structure and have gained interests by many researchers due to their lightweight and low cost when compared to synthetics fibres. Substitution materials from synthetic fibre to natural fibre have become a trend in recent years. Kenaf fibres have {{become one of the}} best candidates to be used as reinforcing materials in polymer composite. However, the adhesion between natural fibre and polymer is weak due to different polarity of natural fibre and hydrophobic polymer. This causes low mechanical properties of the composite. Therefore, in this research the fibre is treated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in order to improve the fibre-matrix adhesion. On top of that, nanosilica particles and glass fibre were also added into the kenaf composite in order to further improve its mechanical properties. This study focuses on the effect of fibre treatment, addition of nanosilica and glass fibre hybridization on tensile properties of kenaf composites. Morphological examination and physical characterization on kenaf and its composites were also conducted. Three different concentrations of sodium hydroxide which are 3, 5 and 7 wt. % were used to soak the natural fibre {{in order to determine the}} suitable concentration of sodium hydroxide. The longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> properties of 3, 5 and 7 wt. % NaOH treated kenaf composites were compared. The results showed that the 7 wt. % NaOH treated kenaf fibre composite has the highest longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> strength. Therefore, 7 wt. % NaOH treated kenaf composites was selected to be impregnated with 3 different percentages of nanosilica (5, 13, 25 wt. %). Longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted on the nanosilica filled kenaf composite. In addition, in order to improve the properties of kenaf composite, it was hybridized with glass fibre. The results showed that the additional of 5 wt. % of nanosilica in kenaf composite improved 29. 73 % of the longitudinal tensile modulus when compared to the pure system. However, a slight decreased in longitudinal tensile strength was recorded. The addition of 13 and 25 wt. % of nanosilica in kenaf composite showed an adverse effect of longitudinal tensile modulus. This may be due to a weak fibrematrix interfacial adhesion because of the presence of nanosilica particles hindered the wetting process of the natural fibre in the matrix. The SEM micrographs showed the evidence of weak interfacial adhesion where fibre pull out and matrix cracking were observed on the fractured specimens. This research contributes to a new knowledge on the effects of fibre treatment, nanosilica inclusion and glass hybridization on tensile properties, morphological and physical properties of kenaf composites...|$|R
40|$|Composite {{materials}} {{made with}} triaxial braid architecture and large tow size carbon fibers {{are beginning to}} be used in many applications, including composite aircraft and engine structures. Recent advancements in braiding technology have led to commercially viable manufacturing approaches for making large structures with complex shape. Although the large unit cell size of these materials is an advantage for manufacturing efficiency, the fiber architecture presents some challenges for materials characterization, design, and analysis. In some cases, the static load capability of structures made using these materials has been higher than expected based on material strength properties measured using standard coupon tests. A potential problem with using standard tests methods for these materials is that the unit cell size can be an unacceptably large fraction of the specimen dimensions. More detailed investigation of deformation and failure processes in large unit cell size triaxial braid composites is needed to evaluate the applicability of standard test methods for these materials and to develop alternative testing approaches. In recent years, commercial equipment has become available that enables digital image correlation to be used on a more routine basis for investigation of full field 3 D deformation in materials and structures. In this paper, some new techniques that have been developed to investigate local deformation and failure using digital image correlation techniques are presented. The methods were used to measure both local and global strains during standard straight-sided coupon <b>tensile</b> <b>tests</b> on composite materials made with 12 and 24 k yarns and a 0 /+ 60 /- 60 triaxial braid architecture. Local deformation and failure within fiber bundles was observed, and this local failure had a significant effect on global stiffness and strength. The matrix material had a large effect on local damage initiation for the two matrix materials used in this investigation. Premature failure in regions of the unit cell {{near the edge of the}} straight-sided specimens was observed for <b>transverse</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>tests</b> in which the braid axial fibers were perpendicular to the specimen axis and the bias fibers terminated on the cut edges in the specimen gage section.
