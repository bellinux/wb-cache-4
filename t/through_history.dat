In modern times, taiko have also {{played a central role in}} social movements for minorities both within and outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortress}} {{was built}} into the south face of a rocky mass, and is barely discernible from the distance as a man-made structure.

The original appearance of the fortress is no longer known, due to the structural changes undertaken by Croatian nobility, Turks, Venetians and Austrians. The present day aspect of a mostly stone fortress dates back to the restructuring work carried out by the Venetians in the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'í {{notions of}} {{progressive}} religious revelation result in their accepting {{the validity of}} the well known religions of the world, whose founders and central figures are seen as Manifestations of God. Religious history is interpreted as a series of dispensations, where each manifestation brings a somewhat broader and more advanced revelation that is rendered as a text of scripture and passed on <b>through</b> <b>history</b> with greater or lesser reliability but at least true in substance, suited for the time and place in which it was expressed. Specific religious social teachings (for example, the direction of prayer, or dietary restrictions) may be revoked by a subsequent manifestation so that a more appropriate requirement for the time and place may be established. Conversely, certain general principles (for example, neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal and consistent. In Bahá'í belief, this process of progressive revelation will not end; it is, however, believed to be cyclical. Bahá'ís do not expect a new manifestation of God to appear within 1000 years of Bahá'u'lláh's revelation.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Hastings {{published}} his autobiography, simply titled The Autobiography of Sir Patrick Hastings, {{and the following}} year published Cases in Court, a book giving his views on 21 of his most noted cases.

In early 1948, he suffered a small stroke which forced him to retire permanently from work as a barrister. On 11 November 1949, {{he and his wife}} travelled to Kenya, where their son Nicky had moved {{to start a new life}} after the end of the Second World War.

5|$|The {{boundaries}} of Slavonia, as a geographical region, {{do not necessarily}} coincide with {{the borders of the}} five counties, except in the south and east where the Sava and Danube rivers define them. The international borders of Croatia are boundaries common to both definitions of the region. In the north, the boundaries largely coincide because the Drava River is considered to be the northern border of Slavonia as a geographic region, but this excludes Baranya from the geographic region's definition even though this territory is part of a county otherwise associated with Slavonia. The western boundary of the geographic region is not specifically defined and it was variously defined <b>through</b> <b>history</b> depending on the political divisions of Croatia. The eastern Croatia, as a geographic term, largely overlaps most definitions of Slavonia. It is defined as the territory of the Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Požega-Slavonia, Virovitica-Podravina and Vukovar-Syrmia counties, including Baranya.|$|E

5|$|The long tail of {{the common}} thresher, the source of many fanciful tales <b>through</b> <b>history,</b> is used in a whip-like fashion to deliver incapacitating blows to its prey. This species feeds mainly on small {{schooling}} forage fishes such as herrings and anchovies. It is a fast, strong swimmer that {{has been known to}} leap clear of the water, and possesses physiological adaptations that allow it to maintain an internal body temperature warmer than that of the surrounding sea water. The common thresher has an aplacental viviparous mode of reproduction, with oophagous embryos that feed on undeveloped eggs ovulated by their mother. Females typically give birth to four pups at a time, following a gestation period of nine months.|$|E
