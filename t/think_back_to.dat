5|$|The game also {{remains the}} only {{national}} championship game to have featured three of the NBA 50 Greatest Players – Jordan, Ewing and Worthy – chosen in 1996 to mark the NBA's 50th anniversary. In addition to Jordan's, Ewing's and Worthy's Hall of Fame NBA careers with the Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers respectively (including a combined 9 NBA championships), Floyd was named an NBA All-Star and still holds playoff records for most points in a quarter and half, while Perkins played in the league for 17 seasons. For Jordan's part, his game-winner is often seen as the launching point of his career - the moment that gave him the confidence to become what many {{believe to be the}} greatest basketball player of all time, in no small part due to his clutch performance. Jordan has said multiple times that before he would take game-winning shots with the Bulls, he would sometimes <b>think</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his shot in the 1982 game that propelled North Carolina past Georgetown.|$|E

25|$|The {{four men}} {{were going to}} spend one year living in {{primitive}} accommodation and working in the hangar, which {{also served as a}} workshop. There were no comforts and the project of building and flying the Ca.1 was very demanding from both a technical and financial point of view.

That is where I think it stems from with her father leaving her, losing her sister, her mom sleeping with her sister’s boyfriend, etc. There are just so many traumatic things! Explaining her reaction to Steffy killing her cousin Aly Forrester (Ashlyn Pearce) in self-defense, Wood stated in August 2015: [...] "When I first heard about it, I was in major shock, of course. Then I started thinking about how everything bad happens to Steffy and that it makes sense that she's a murderer now. It's kind of perfect, really." ...|$|E

2500|$|Islamic {{fundamentalism}} {{has been}} defined as a movement of Muslims who <b>think</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> earlier times and seek to return to the fundamentals of the religion and live similarly to how the prophet Muhammad and his companions lived. Islamic fundamentalists favor [...] "a literal and originalist interpretation" [...] of the primary sources of Islam (the Quran and Sunnah), and seek to eliminate (what they perceive to be) [...] "corrupting" [...] non-Islamic influences from every part of their lives, [...] and see [...] "Islamic fundamentalism" [...] as a pejorative term used by outsiders for Islamic revivalism and Islamic activism.|$|E

"When I <b>think</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> it, it {{was such}} a crucial point to so many people, we didn't even realise back then but it showed us what we would be doing for the next year of our lives. We were never nervous about Anette, or the album being good, but we just couldn't tell how people would take it. Would they like Anette? Would they like the music? That was in the back of our minds all the time. And there was such a huge amount of money involved, over 800.000 euros, that we needed to sell at least a few albums to get going," [...] Tuomas Holopainen was recalling in 2008.|$|E

2500|$|... {{noted that}} Rowling admires Roddy Doyle and Jane Austen, saying [...] "both of whom write about class distinctions," [...] {{and asked if}} the reason Rowling wrote about class was a {{conscious}} decision. Rowling replied, [...] "kids are acutely aware of money—before they're aware of class. A kid isn't really going to notice how another kid holds his knife and fork. But a kid will be acutely aware that he doesn't have pocket money. Or that he doesn't have as much pocket money. I <b>think</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> myself at 11. Kids can be mean, very mean. So it was there in Ron not having the proper length robes, you know? And {{not being able to}} buy stuff on the trolley. He's got to have sandwiches his mum made for him, even though he doesn't like the sandwiches.

2500|$|Lyrically, Ed Droste {{described}} Shields as Grizzly Bear's [...] "most verbose album" [...] yet, noting, [...] "It's funny, because I <b>think</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a song like [...] "Colorado", where I {{was basically}} singing ten words {{over and over}} again for five minutes straight – and that's it. There's nothing on this album like that. There's a lot more there, verbally, and it's definitely emotionally charged." [...] Bassist and producer, Chris Taylor stated, [...] "For this record, it was really important to us to try and make sure that lyrics had a weight to them and at least some sense of a narrative, even if it was loose. There were lyrics in previous albums that seemed to have no meaning whatsoever. And that always really annoyed me. We agreed it'd be really important and awesome if we could just try and make all the lyrics tell something. [...] I was definitely able to use lyrics as a frame to how I would let the arrangements build and then fall away." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a video titled [...] "Global Warming Unmasked: The Hidden Agenda", Voris {{claimed that}} [...] "Catholic leaders must {{recognize}} global warming {{for what it}} is. It is a government power grab via population reduction. It is a pseudoscience and hyper-sensationalism. These things {{are being used to}} promote the global warming agenda, just {{as they were in the}} early 20th century eugenics movement... In fact, global warming is the evolution, the natural evolution, of that early eugenics program." [...] Voris said, [...] "Hitler adopted the American eugenic ideals and implemented them throughout his Nazi regime. Hitler did not originate the idea of eugenics and creating a superior Aryan race. It was indeed an American concept. He saw this happening in America, and went 'Ah-ha' and grabbed it and incorporated it into his whole Nazi philosophy." [...] Voris held that governments accepting the concept of global warming might limit availability of energy, cutting off those who [...] "exceed what Washington says is your limit [...] you can either be charged an exorbitant fine or perhaps have your energy supply limited or even cut off. ...If you think the government interfering in private lives to this extent based on junk science and the hysteria surrounding it just isn't possible... <b>think</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the tens of thousands of citizens who were sterilized against their will by the government in state after state after state. ...And remember the only thing that brought the eugenics movement to an end was the horror of the Nazi death camps. If that had not happened, sterilization would just be a normal thing. It was so revolting that finally people said, 'this whole theory is wrong.' Government leaders were quite happy to just roll along exercising power without limit over their citizens." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 24 April, the FA handed Suárez a 10-match ban, after a three-man {{independent}} committee {{agreed that}} the standard three match ban was insufficient. In their written reasons, the FA pointed to Suárez's lackadaisical attitude to the whole incident, citing that he [...] "had not fully appreciated the gravity and seriousness of this truly exceptional incident". They also argued that [...] "these unsavoury pictures would have given a bad image of English football domestically and across the world alike", {{and that it would}} act as a deterrent to further behaviour. Suárez ruled out an appeal, citing recognition of his actions being unacceptable and that it would give [...] "the wrong impression" [...] if he did so. Rodgers launched a strong defence of his player stating that [...] "when you look at it in the cold light of day then it was violent conduct... he made a mistake and he's got a sanction which I don't believe fits with what he did". Rodgers also launched a broadside on the FA and their handling of the case, claiming [...] "prejudices" [...] against the FA led to the lengthy ban, and also pointed out alleged inconsistencies in the prior punishment of players who have bitten another human being, giving the lack of punishment Jermain Defoe received for biting Javier Mascherano in 2006 as an example. After the ban was imposed, Ivanović finally accepted Suárez's apology. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was reminded of Eric Cantona's suspension in 1995 for kicking a racist Crystal Palace spectator, and showed empathy toward the situation, saying [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Cantona and I have to say that a nine-month ban doesn't equate to a 10-match, does it? I can understand how Liverpool are aggrieved at it, I must say that".|$|E

Never by word or sign did she hint that its tiny hall and its dingy and unfashionable furnishings were unworthy of us both, on the contrary she went ahead with shining face.|$|E

It is probable that I overcame her objections by telling her that I wanted more material for my book of Indian tales; anyhow I left her in Chicago almost as soon as we arrived there, and went again to Darlington and Colony to see Major Stouch and John Seger, and to make certain observations for President Roosevelt.|$|E
