500|$|The Gokturks, {{renowned for}} their {{expertise}} in hand-to-hand combat, never excelled in siegecraft. For this reason Gumilev attributes {{the taking of}} Tiflis to the Khazars. There are good reasons for believing that this success encouraged Tong Yabghu to grander designs. This time he planned to incorporate Aghvania into his khaganate, rather than to wield a usual campaign of plunder. Before returning to Suyab he instructed Böri Shad and his generals to [...] "spare {{the lives of the}} rulers and nobles of that land, in as much as they come out <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>my</b> son, surrender to my rule, concede their towns, castles, and trade to my troops".|$|E

2500|$|Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court Harlan Fiske Stone {{called the}} Nuremberg trials a fraud.

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{even at the}} time the Nuremberg trials {{appeared}} to be victor's justice, revenge papered over with legal simulcra. US Supreme Court Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone remarked that his colleague Justice Jackson acting as Nuremberg Chief prosecutor was [...] "conducting his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg.

2500|$|Sociologist Susie Scott {{challenged}} the interpretation {{and treatment of}} shyness as being pathological. [...] "By treating shyness as an individual pathology, ... we forget that {{this is also a}} socially oriented state of mind that is socially produced and managed." [...] She explores the idea that [...] "shyness is a form of deviance: a problem for society as much as for the individual", and concludes that, to some extent, [...] "we are all impostors, faking our way through social life". One of her interview subjects (self-defined as shy) puts this point of view even more strongly: [...] "Sometimes I want to take my cue from the militant disabled lobbyists and say, 'hey, it's not MY problem, it's society's'. I want to be proud to be shy: on the whole, shys are probably more sensitive, and nicer people, than 'normals'. I shouldn't have to change: society should adapt <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>my</b> needs." ...|$|E

At another Christie's auction in 2014, My Bed was sold to White Cube founding director Jay Jopling for 2.5million pounds, including buyer's commission, once again to benefit the Saatchi Gallery's foundation.

2500|$|Walcott {{was born}} to a black British Jamaican father and a white English mother. He grew up as a Liverpool fan due to his father's support of Liverpool. When Chelsea asked {{him to be a}} ball boy, he used the {{opportunity}} to meet his Liverpool idols:"I was playing in a tournament for Swindon when Southampton and Chelsea showed an interest. Chelsea invited me to be a ball-boy for a match against Liverpool and it was fantastic <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>my</b> heroes Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler. I was a Liverpool fan simply because my dad followed them. Unfortunately I wasn't born when the team had their golden era, but I enjoyed watching the likes of Michael Owen, Robbie Fowler and Steve McManaman when I was growing up. When Liverpool won the Champions League last year, I went mad. I was shouting so loud I think I woke up the entire village where I live!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, in {{a message}} to his {{subjects}} the King conveyed, [...] "Do not worry about me, he will release me soon, without any need for payment- Tong Seal {{does not seem to}} be wealthy either." [...] When Pu Tong Seal found out about La King's attitude, he secretly collected all the wealth under his province such as silver, beads, bells, (zaam) a traditional musical instrument made of copper, other house utensils, and stored them in a large house to impress La King. One evening, Pu Tong Seal revealed his treasury to La King, and said, [...] "If you do not want <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>my</b> demand it is fine with me, I do not need your wealth, because I am already a very wealthy man- but in that case, you will never be released to see your kingdom and your family." [...] His determination to keep the Burman king alive but never to release him was very obvious in his stern voice. This sent a chill down La King's spine. La King then immediately sent another message to his Kingdom; this time, the King ordered them to fetch him at once with all the demanded ransom.
