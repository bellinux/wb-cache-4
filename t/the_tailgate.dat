5|$|The bear follows {{and climbs}} {{on top of}} the Jeep, smashing up the car and {{eventually}} overturning it before leaving as the sun sets. Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia, crying about wanting to go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up, load him back in the car, then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap, the bear swings at her through a window sending her back against the trap, which impales her back. She returns to the vehicle where the bear rips off <b>the</b> <b>tailgate</b> and drags away Sean's body.|$|E
5|$|Players {{control a}} monocle- and pith helmet–wearing Velociraptor driving a jeep. The {{aim of the}} game is to attain a high score by {{performing}} stunts, damaging the jeep during collisions, collecting orbs, and killing the other Velociraptor which run around the area. The vehicle is equipped with a spiked ball and chain which can be deployed from <b>the</b> <b>tailgate</b> as many times as the player wishes. Deploying the spiked ball increases the difficulty of maneuvering the vehicle. The ball can be released from the chain at any time, if done so during a turn the weapon is launched forward. Players kill other Velociraptor by ramming them with the jeep or crushing them with the spiked ball which is dragged behind the vehicle. Slain dinosaurs can be dragged to exporters by the spiked ball and chain to gain extra points. Exporters are teleporting devices which transport the slain dinosaurs to the future.|$|E

25|$|On September 26, 1937, Smith was {{critically}} {{injured in}} a car crash while traveling along U.S. Route 61 between Memphis, Tennessee, and Clarksdale, Mississippi. Her lover, Richard Morgan, was driving and misjudged the speed of a slow-moving truck ahead of him. Tire marks at the scene suggested that Morgan tried to avoid the truck by driving around its left side, but he hit the rear of the truck side-on at high speed. <b>The</b> <b>tailgate</b> of the truck sheared off the wooden roof of Smith's old Packard. Smith, who was in the passenger seat, probably with her right arm or elbow out the window, took the full brunt of the impact. Morgan escaped without injuries.|$|E

25|$|The FJ cruiser was {{primarily}} {{developed for the}} North American market but has been sold in small numbers globally since its launch. On 25 November 2010, Toyota announced sales would begin in right-hand drive form for the Japanese market. Sales began on December 4, replacing the outgoing Hilux Surf and selling alongside the Land Cruiser. Japanese-produced right-hand drive models have a different rear bumper to North American models with the license plate located on the bumper as opposed to under <b>the</b> <b>tailgate</b> door handle. In addition, right-hand drive versions have the side indicator markers located on the fender panels, rather than located on the side-view mirrors used for left-hand drive production FJ Cruisers. Sales of right-hand drive model began in Australia and New Zealand in 2011 available in four-wheel drive automatics only.|$|E
25|$|Interior design {{improvements}} {{were another}} {{main focus of}} the LRX concept though {{the interior of the}} production Evoque changed significantly from the concept LRX. Notable interior features in the LRX included ambient interior lighting that changed according to Terrain Response settings, and vehicle data which was presented to the driver through a ‘floating’ three-dimensional LCD display. An aluminium centre console with an iPhone docking station stretched the length of the cabin, separating the four seats and <b>the</b> <b>tailgate.</b> Seats with open frameworks were used to give the impression of an airy interior while also creating useful under-seat and under-floor stowage areas. Electric motors folded the rear seats forward providing enough room for two mountain bikes to be fitted upright, with front wheels removed and stored in dedicated slots in the floor.|$|E
25|$|The HX series {{release of}} 1976 saw only minor updates to the exterior, notably the grille and badgework, {{although}} base specification utilities and panel vans retained the HJ grill (except Sandman which got HX Kingswood frontal treatment). When the HX was released, government emissions controls had been tightened and Holden {{needed to make}} significant changes to their engines. This resulted {{in a loss of}} performance across the range and the deletion of the 2.84-litre straight-six. In addition, a Kingswood panel van was introduced to the range of commercial vehicle offerings. The HX Sandman introduced a large 'Sandman' logo on <b>the</b> <b>tailgate</b> and stripes down the sides. During the course of the HX series, front bucket seats were adopted as standard equipment for Kingswood-badged vehicles. As with the previous series, a couple of special-build HX Kingswood variants emerged later in production, initially with the Kingswood 50th Anniversary sedan in November 1976 and also a repeat appearance of the Kingswood Deluxe sedan.|$|E

500|$|Introduced in July 2008, the A$110million VE Sportwagon {{programme}} {{represented a}} departure from previous Commodore station wagons. Holden was concerned that the traditional wagon market was being severely eroded by growing sport utility vehicle (SUV) sales and over-reliance on fleet purchasing. Up to 90percent of VZ wagons were bought by fleet companies and Holden sought to attract more retail customers. The {{decision was made to}} develop a sportier, more stylish wagon as an alternative to SUVs. The Sportwagon, unlike the previous VZ wagon, which shared its long-wheelbase with the Statesman/Caprice is built on the same short-wheelbase platform as the sedan. This shift in thinking means cargo capacity is reduced from VZ's [...] to [...] but the sedan's near 50:50 weight distribution is retained. The Sportwagon is styled with an aggressively sloping rear profile. To ensure the cargo opening is sufficiently large with such a profile, <b>the</b> <b>tailgate</b> hinges part way up the roof line. The design of <b>the</b> <b>tailgate</b> is compact enough to open in just [...] of space, a publicised feature in Sportwagon television commercials.|$|E
2500|$|A minor trim {{facelift}} {{occurred after}} only a year of being on sale. A new [...] "smooth" [...] version of the Renault diamond badge (the previous [...] "ribbed" [...] badge was being phased out at the time) and a new front seat design were the only changes. The altered design did not constitute a new [...] "phase". In March 1994 (at the Geneva Motor Show), the phase two model was launched, with small updates to the exterior and interior of the Clio. Most noticeable was {{the change in the}} front grille from two metal ribs to a single colour-coded slat. The bump strips were made slightly larger and rounder and had the car's trim level badge incorporated into them. The badges on <b>the</b> <b>tailgate</b> strip were moved up onto <b>the</b> <b>tailgate</b> itself and <b>the</b> <b>tailgate</b> strip was given a carbon fibre look. The rear light clusters were given a slightly more rounded bubble shape, giving the Clio a more modern look. The clusters, however, are physically interchangeable with phase ones'.|$|E

The three-seat model had a forward-facing rear seat that was placed over the rear axle area allowing for two additional occupants making them eight-passenger wagons. The Kingswood Estate had the [...] two-barrel engine as standard with the same engine options as the coupes and sedans. Station wagon models came only with single exhaust systems which meant lesser power ratings than coupes and sedans.|$|E

5000|$|The Junction, {{located on}} the south side of the stadium, is a grassy park where Bulldog fans {{tailgate}} under tents during sports weekends. It is named The Junction for the railroad that ran through <b>the</b> <b>tailgating</b> area in <b>the</b> campus' past. It also replaced [...] "Malfunction Junction", a set of adjacent intersections where 6 different streets converged on campus. The streets were rerouted around the area and a pedestrian park was built on the site. While many Bulldog fans tailgate in other places on campus, The Junction is unique in that it allows thousands of fans to tailgate under tents directly in front of the stadium without cars or traffic. The Junction has been referred to as <b>the</b> “premier <b>tailgate</b> experience” by <b>the</b> Birmingham-based firm contracted for its design and development.|$|R
