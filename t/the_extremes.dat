5|$|Between <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> of {{bicycles}} with classical {{front-wheel steering}} {{and those with}} strictly rear-wheel steering is a class of bikes with a pivot point somewhere between the two, referred to as center-steering, and similar to articulated steering. An early implementation of the concept was the Phantom bicycle in the early 1870s promoted as a safer alternative to the penny-farthing. This design allows for simple front-wheel drive and current implementations appear to be quite stable, even rideable no-hands, as many photographs illustrate.|$|E
40|$|Research on <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> {{right is}} rare, and <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> right has even more rarely been {{analysed}} {{as a social}} movement. In this volume, <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> right is compared in Italy, Germany, and the United States using concepts and methods developed in social movement studies. In particular, the book describes the discourse, action, and organizational structures of <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> right, and explains these {{on the basis of}} the available discursive and political opportunities. Three main empirical methods are used in the research. Firstly, the frame analysis looks at the cognitive mechanisms that are relevant in influencing organizational and individual behaviour. Second, network analysis looks at the (inter-) organizational structural characteristics of right-wing organizations. Finally, protest event analysis allows for an empirical summary of the actions undertaken by right-wing extremists over the last decade. The substantive chapters address the organizational structure of <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> right, their action repertoires, the framing of protest events, the definition of ‘us’, the struggle against modernity, old and new forms of racism, opposition to globalization, and populism. 1. <b>The</b> <b>extreme</b> right and social movement studies: an introduction 2.

5|$|Most {{bears are}} {{opportunistic}} omnivores and consume more plant than animal matter. They eat anything from leaves, roots, and berries to insects, carrion, fresh meat, and fish, and have digestive systems and teeth adapted {{to such a}} diet. At <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> are the almost entirely herbivorous giant panda and the mostly carnivorous polar bear. However, all bears feed on any food source that becomes seasonally available. For example, Asiatic black bears in Taiwan consume large numbers of acorns when these are most common, and switch to ungulates at other times of the year.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding the General Assembly's {{attempt to}} promote peace and unity, two {{distinct}} factions, the Old School and the New School, developed through the 1820s over {{the issues of}} confessional subscription, revivalism, {{and the spread of}} New England theology. The New School faction advocated revivalism and New England theology, while the Old School was opposed to <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> of revivalism and desired strict conformity to the Westminster Confession. The ideological center of Old School Presbyterianism was Princeton Theological Seminary, which under the leadership of Archibald Alexander and Charles Hodge became associated with a brand of Reformed scholasticism known as Princeton Theology.|$|E
5|$|The island's lush vegetation, {{a product}} of its mild climate and {{frequent}} rainfall, earns it the sobriquet the Emerald Isle.

Extreme Park offers a group of extreme game such as wall climbing, skateboarding, bicycle motocross, paintball, Parkour and mountain biking.

5|$|While {{the stars}} are fixed to their declinations the Sun is not. The rising point of the Sun varies {{throughout}} the year. It swings between two limits marked by the solstices {{a bit like a}} pendulum, slowing as it reaches <b>the</b> <b>extremes,</b> but passing rapidly through the midpoint. If an archaeoastronomer can calculate from the azimuth and horizon height that a site was built to view a declination of +23.5° then he or she need not wait until 21 June to confirm the site does indeed face the summer solstice. For more information see History of solar observation.|$|E
5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, they are free to move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E

5|$|Breeds {{are often}} {{categorized}} by {{the type of}} their wool. Fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles. Most of these were derived from Merino sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry. Downs breeds have wool between <b>the</b> <b>extremes,</b> and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces. Some major medium wool breeds, such as the Corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks. Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. For example: the American Columbia breed was developed by crossing Lincoln rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled Rambouillet ewes.|$|E
5|$|T.F. Tout, in 1914 one of {{the first}} historians to make a {{thorough}} academic study of the period, considered Pembroke the one favourable exception in an age of small-minded and incompetent leaders. Tout wrote of a 'middle party', led by Pembroke, representing a moderate position between <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> of Edward and Lancaster. This 'middle party' supposedly took control of royal government through the Treaty of Leake in 1318. In his authoritative study of 1972, J.R.S. Phillips rejects this view. In spite of misgivings with the King’s favourites, Pembroke was consistently loyal to Edward. What was accomplished in 1318 was not the takeover by a 'middle party', but simply a restoration of royal power.|$|E

Attentive observation and accurate recognition of these tactics means taking <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> right's deliberately crafted slogans, symbols, and themes seriously.

40|$|The {{ideology}} of <b>the</b> <b>Extreme</b> Right in Western Europe {{is rooted in}} Catholic fundamentalism and Counter-Revolutionary ideas. However, <b>the</b> <b>Extreme</b> Right, like all other political families, has had to adjust to an increasingly secular society. The old link between religion and <b>the</b> <b>Extreme</b> Right has thus been broken and in fact already was when Fascism overtook Europe: Fascism was secular, sometimes even anti-religious, in its essence. Although Catholic fundamentalists still retain strong positions within the apparatus of several Extreme Right parties (Front National), the vote for <b>the</b> <b>Extreme</b> Right is generally weak among regular churchgoers and strong among non-believers. In several countries, the vote for <b>the</b> <b>Extreme</b> Right is stronger among Protestant voters than among Catholics, since while Catholics may support Christian-Democratic parties, {{there are very few}} political parties linked to Protestant churches. Presently, it also seems that Paganism is becoming the dominant religious creed within <b>the</b> <b>Extreme</b> Right. In a multicultural Europe, non-Christian forms of religious fundamentalism such as Islamism also exist with ideological similarities to <b>the</b> <b>Extreme</b> Right, but this is not sufficient to categorize Islamism as a form of Fascism. Some Islamist groups seek alliances with <b>the</b> <b>Extreme</b> Right on <b>the</b> basis of their common dislike for Israel and the West, globalization and individual freedom of thought...|$|R
