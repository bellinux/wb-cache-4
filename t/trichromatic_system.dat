40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on {{engineering}} effective color vision subsystems for object segmentation based on hue and discontinuities in hue. Hue, which encodes color, is a psychophysical scalar variable defined on the ring [0, [pi]]. A computational theory justifying the use of hue for distinguishing material differences is established and novel algorithms are developed to detect its discontinuity. Although the {{focus of this}} thesis has been on anthropocentrically based trichromatic systems, some effort is placed in exploring the multi-dimensional spaces of more than three primary colors. A hypothetical explanation is proposed of the 11 spectral sensors of the Mantis shrimp, which performs functionally as a biological spectrum analyzer. The importance of the opponency calculation is emphasized. Its role in optimum filter design offers hyperacuity in the spectral domain. This work encompasses spectral filter design, color space evaluation, computer vision algorithm development, and hardware implementation in custom analog VLSI circuitry. A one pixel (zero dimension) "intensity/normalized-color/hue" sensor is built based on a <b>trichromatic</b> <b>system.</b> For the basic analog circuit element required in hue segmentation, the current-fuse is developed. Guidelines for building higher dimensional sensors in both spatial and spectral domains are presented. Practical offshoots from this research range from color quality sensors for inexpensive printing to vision systems for robotics and autonomous vehicles. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{companion}} article {{introduced a}} set of orthonormal opponent color matching functions. That “orthonormal basis ” is an expedient for plotting lights in Jozef Cohen’s logical color space. Indeed, graphing the new color matching functions (CMFs) together (as a parametric plot) gives Cohen’s invariant “locus of unit monochromats, ” or LUM. In this article, the functions and related vector methods are applied to fundamental problems. In signal transmission and propagation-of-errors work, it is desirable to describe stimuli by decorrelated components. The orthonormal CMFs inherently do this, and an example is worked out using a large set of color chips. Starting with the orthonormal functions, related functions, such as cone sensitivities, are graphed as directions in color space, showing their intrinsic relationships. Building on work of Tominaga and co-authors, vectorial plots {{are related to the}} problem of guessing the illuminant, a step towards a constancy method. The issue of color rendering is clarified when the vectorial compositions of test and reference lights are graphed. A single graph shows the constraint that the total vectors are the same, but also shows the differences in colorimetric terms. Since the LUM summarizes a <b>trichromatic</b> <b>system</b> by a 3 -dimensional graph, dichromatic observers can be represented by 2 -D graphs, revealing details in a consistent way. The “fit first method ” compares camera to human, applying the Luther criterion in graphical detail. ...|$|E

500|$|It is a dopant in {{some types}} of glass in lasers and other {{optoelectronic}} devices. Europium oxide (Eu2O3) is widely used as a red phosphor in television sets and fluorescent lamps, and as an activator for yttrium-based phosphors. Color TV screens contain between 0.5 and 1g of europium oxide. Whereas trivalent europium gives red phosphors, the luminescence of divalent europium depends strongly on {{the composition of the}} host structure. UV to deep red luminescence can be achieved. The two classes of europium-based phosphor (red and blue), combined with the yellow/green terbium phosphors give [...] "white" [...] light, the color temperature of which can be varied by altering the proportion or specific composition of the individual phosphors. This phosphor system is typically encountered in helical fluorescent light bulbs. Combining the same three classes is one way to make <b>trichromatic</b> <b>systems</b> in TV and computer screens. Europium is also used in the manufacture of fluorescent glass. One of the more common persistent after-glow phosphors besides copper-doped zinc sulfide is europium-doped strontium aluminate. Europium fluorescence is used to interrogate biomolecular interactions in drug-discovery screens. It is also used in the anti-counterfeiting phosphors in euro banknotes.|$|R

Even so, {{it is not clear}} how the signals in the 12 midband spectra receptors are read out by the brain. Natu-ral spectra are not monochromatic and the animal would need to distinguish changes in brightness, perhaps caused by high-lights and shadows, from colorful objects. The visual system would have to compare the signals in single midband receptors with those of others, as in normal color opponency. A simple way would be divide the response of each receptor type by an overall brightness signal derived by sum-ming the outputs of all midband receptors. An alternative is to compare signals of the three receptor types in each midband row, in effect giving the animal four independent <b>trichromatic</b> <b>systems.</b> The poor color discrimination found (3) is also a puzzle. It would be interesting to understand how stomatopods use color in their daily lives. For instance, in confl icts mantis shrimps seem to assess their oppo-nent’s color to decide whether to f ight, allowing them to avoid dangerous oppo-nents (9). If so, they are likely to need to discriminate smaller differences than those found when they are trained to associate color with food (3) ...|$|R

For example, the house mouse Mus musculus possesses more than 1, 500 functional genes encoding CRs in its genome, reflecting its adaptation to nocturnal life. In comparison, the number of functional CRs is significantly lower in higher primates, likely due to their diurnal lifestyles or the emergence of a <b>trichromatic</b> color-vision <b>system</b> (Nei et al. 2008).|$|R

In insects it has been shown that differential conditioning is important for processing fine colour discriminations. However, the visual system of many insects, including the honeybee, has a complex set of neural pathways, in which input from the long wavelength sensitive (&# 039;green&# 039;) photoreceptor may be processed either as an independent achromatic signal or as part of a <b>trichromatic</b> opponent-colour <b>system.</b> Thus, a potential confound of colour learning in insects is the possibility that modulation of the &# 039;green&# 039; photoreceptor could underlie observations...|$|R

Here, we discuss the diversity of their visual systems. Cichlids have seven unique cone opsin genes, which produce visual pigments sensitive from the ultraviolet to the red end of the spectrum. Different species typically express three visual pigments to produce a <b>trichromatic</b> visual <b>system.</b> Because species differ in which sets of opsin genes they express, visual sensitivities can differ widely. In addition to the large visual pigment shifts from changing gene expression, cichlids can also more finely tune visual pigments through altera-tions in opsin amino acid sequence.

25|$|Many {{invertebrates}} have {{color vision}}. Honeybees and bumblebees have trichromatic color vision which is insensitive to red but sensitive to ultraviolet. Osmia rufa, for example, possess a <b>trichromatic</b> color <b>system,</b> which they use in foraging for pollen from flowers. In {{view of the}} importance of color vision to bees one might expect these receptor sensitivities to reflect their specific visual ecology; for example the types of flowers that they visit. However, the main groups of hymenopteran insects excluding ants (i.e., bees, wasps and sawflies) mostly have three types of photoreceptor, with spectral sensitivities similar to the honeybee's. Papilio butterflies possess six types of photoreceptors and may have pentachromatic vision. The most complex color vision system in the animal kingdom has been found in stomatopods (such as the mantis shrimp) with up to 12 spectral receptor types thought to work as multiple dichromatic units.|$|R
50|$|The {{photoreceptor}} cells {{involved in}} vision are the rods and cones. These cells contain a chromophore (11-cis retinal, the aldehyde of Vitamin A1 and light-absorbing portion) bound to cell membrane protein, opsin. Rods deal with {{low light level}} and do not mediate color vision. Cones, on the other hand, can code the color of an image through comparison of the outputs of the three different types of cones. Each cone type responds best to certain wavelengths, or colors, of light because each type has a slightly different opsin. The three types of cones are L-cones, M-cones and S-cones that respond optimally to long wavelengths (reddish color), medium wavelengths (greenish color), and short wavelengths (bluish color) respectively. Humans have a <b>trichromatic</b> visual <b>system</b> consisting of three unique systems, rods, mid and long-wavelength sensitive (red and green) cones and short wavelength sensitive (blue) cones.|$|R

A <b>trichromatic</b> visual <b>system</b> makes fewer measurements than there are unknowns. We address this problem by writing the reflectance spectra of small groups of pixels as linear combinations of ”spatio-spectral ” basis functions. These aggregated surface reflectance spectra require fewer parameters to describe than the sum of the spectral parameters for the individual surface pixels, giving us more measurements than unknown parameters. We explore this problem in a Bayesian context, showing when the problem is over or underdetermined based on analyzing the local curvature characteristics of the log-likelihood function. We show how using the spatio-spectral basis functions might give us improved re-flectance and illumination spectral estimates when applied to real image data. ...|$|R
40|$|Mimics closely {{resemble}} unrelated species to avoid predation, capture prey or {{gain access to}} hosts or reproductive opportunities. However, the classification of mimicry systems into three established evolutionary mechanisms (protection, reproduction and foraging) can be contentious because multiple benefits may be gained by mimics, causing the evolution of such systems {{to be driven by}} more than one selective agent. However, data on such systems are generally speculative or anecdotal. This study provides empirical evidence that dual benefits apply to a coral reef fish mimic in terms of increased access to food (aggressive mimicry) and reduced predation risk (Batesian mimicry). Bicolour fangblennies Plagiotremus laudandus gained access to more reef fish victims, which they attack to feed on fins and scales, when they spent more time associated with their model Meiacanthus atrodorsalis. Furthermore, exact replicas of P. laudandus incurred fewer approaches from potential predators compared with control replicas that varied in resemblance to P. laudandus. Predators with <b>trichromatic</b> visual <b>systems</b> (three distinct spectral sensitivities) could potentially distinguish between replicas based on colour based on theoretical vision models. Therefore, this mimicry system could be best described as Batesian-aggressive mimicry in which mimicry evolution is driven by multiple simultaneous selective pressures...|$|R

Fluorescent lighting is more energy-efficient than incandescent lighting elements. However, the uneven spectrum of traditional {{fluorescent lamp}}s may cause certain colors to appear different than when illuminated by incandescent light or daylight. The mercury vapor emission spectrum is dominated by a short-wave UV line at 254nm (which provides most of the energy to the phosphors), accompanied by visible light emission at 436nm (blue), 546nm (green) and 579nm (yellow-orange). These three lines can be observed superimposed on the white continuum using a hand spectroscope, for light emitted by the usual white fluorescent tubes.

40|$|Natural {{illuminant}} and reflectance spectra can {{be roughly}} approximated by a linear model with {{as few as}} three basis functions, and this {{has suggested that the}} visual systemmight construct a linear representation of the spectra by estimating the weights of these functions. However, such models do not accommodate nonlinearities in color appearance, such as the Abney effect. Previously, we found that these nonlinearities are qualitatively consistent with a perceptual inference that stimulus spectra are instead roughly Gaussian, with the hue tied to the inferred centroid of the spectrum [J. Vision 6 (9), 12 (2006) ]. Here, we examined to what extent a Gaussian inference pro-vides a sufficient approximation of natural color signals. Reflectance and illuminant spectra from a wide set of databases were analyzed to test howwell the curves could be fit by either a simple Gaussian with three parameters (amplitude, peak wavelength, and standard deviation) versus the first three principal component analysis com-ponents of standard linear models.

40|$|Flowering {{plants in}} New Zealand {{have often been}} {{described}} as having predominantly small white or pale flowers, possibly due to an absence of social insects as a major pollinating force. However, insect vision is considerably different to human perception, and these hypotheses need to be assessed considering insect perceptual capabilities. We collected spectral reflectance data from flowers of 23 native species in an alpine region of New Zealand at an altitude above 1500 m where 77 % of flowers {{have been reported to}} possess small white or pale flowers. Our spectral analyses show that these flowers actually have very strong chromatic signals for hymenoptera colour vision. Indeed the spectral signals of these flowers most frequently have inflection points at about 400 and 500 nm, which closely match the region of best spectral discrimination by hymenopteran pollinators with a <b>trichromatic</b> visual <b>system.</b> When the flower spectra are plotted in a colour space designed for hymenoptera, the data reveals that most of the flower colours would be well detected against background foliage, and often reliably discriminated from the other flowers appearing in the same alpine environment.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the developmental plasticity of colour vision, we reared fish with a <b>trichromatic</b> cone <b>system</b> (Aequidens pulcher) under three near-monochromatic lights, differentially stimulating each spectral cone type from the larval stage {{to the age}} of at least one year. Control conditions comprised white lights of two intensities. The treatments did not affect the visual pigments, hut led to significant changes in cone outer segment lengths. Furthermore, in the blue-reared group the density of single cones within the retina was reduced by two-thirds after 18 months of exposure, while no changes were observed in the other groups. The connectivity of cone horizontal cells with the single cones was influenced by the intensity and spectral composition of the rearing lights: H 1 cells were more sensitive to the spectral component, whereas H 2 cells responded to intensity cues. In the blue-light group the dynamics of horizontal cell synaptic spinule formation and degradation were severely compromised. These observations show that long-term spectral deprivation leads to significant morphological changes at the level of photoreceptors and horizontal cells. While the reactions of photoreceptors may be interpreted mostly in terms of compensation, the functional consequences of the changes observed on the horizontal cell level remain to be determined electrophysiologically...|$|R

We investigated preferences for transmissive colors and contrasts in the apple blossom weevil, Anthonomus pomorum L., which colonizes apple trees, Malus domestica Borkh., in early spring. The main components of the supposed visual system, green, blue, and UV light, were offered to the weevils versus black or versus each other in a dual choice arena. Furthermore, silhouettes of two different achromatic contrasts were offered in front of the colors blue and green. We also tested whether visual preferences change with time, i. e., 2, 4, and 6 d after termination of diapause in early spring. Female weevils chose UV, green, and blue over black, whereas males only chose UV over black in a series of dual choice experiments. Both sexes preferred blue to green. Weevil response to silhouettes of different contrasts was influenced by the background color, i. e., the silhouette with the higher contrast was preferred in front of green, whereas the silhouette with the lower contrast was preferred in front of blue. The preferences during visual orientation did not change with time after diapause. The more discriminating response of females may reflect a greater visual acuity or a greater visual responsiveness in females than in males because of a higher affinity for the host plant.

40|$|In {{bees and}} many other insects the {{majority}} of photoreceptors are twisted like a corkscrew. Here we show that this structural feature of insect eyes-whose very existence {{was a source of}} dispute for several years-is necessary for reliable encoding of information about color. Light reflected from waxy plant surfaces is partially linearly polarized. Moreover, insect photoreceptor membranes are dichroic and thus sensitive to the polarized glare originating from plant surfaces. Taken together, these two phenomena create a serious false-color problem: in the bee's <b>trichromatic</b> color vision <b>system,</b> the color values of a particular part of a plant could be affected not only by the spectral but also by the polarization properties of the reflecting surface. As demonstrated by spectroscopic measurements and optical analyses, the hue of color of a given surface of a plant would change dramatically with the direction of illumination and the bee's line of sight, if the bee possessed straight and thus highly "polarization-sensitive" photoreceptors.

We found that type I ommatidia contain one ultraviolet and one blue receptor, type II ommatidia contain two ultraviolet receptors, and type III ommatidia have two blue receptors. All the three ommatidial types contain six green receptors. The ommatidia appear to be distributed rather randomly over the retina. The ratio of type I, II, and III ommatidia was about 44 : 46 : 10. Type III ommatidia appeared to be slightly more frequent (18 %) in the anterior part of the ventral region of the eye.

40|$|Both the phylogenetic {{structure}} and trait composition of flowering plant communities {{may be expected}} to change with altitude. In particular, floral colours are thought to vary with altitude because Hymenoptera typically decline in importance as pollinators while Diptera and Lepidoptera become more important at higher elevations. Thus, ecological filtering among elevation zones and competitive processes among co-occurring species within zones could influence the floral chromatic cues present at low and high elevations. We collected data from 107 species of native flowering plants in the Himalaya Mountains of central Nepal over an elevation range of 900 - 4100 m, which includes habitat ranging from subtropical to subalpine within a relatively small geographical area. Using a phylogenetic framework, we asked whether and how flower colour diversity differed between species assemblages at lower and higher elevation, between monocots and eudicots, and between our sample from central Nepal and angiosperms from other regions of the world. There was significant phylogenetic clustering in the communities as a result of monocots, particularly orchids, which were found overwhelmingly at lower elevations. Phylogenetic signal for floral colours indicated that related species had colours that were more disparate than expected under Brownian motion evolution. Floral colours were significantly more diverse in the higher elevation subalpine zone than in the subtropical zone. However, the chromatic cues at both elevations were consistent with the hue discrimination abilities of the <b>trichromatic</b> hymenopteran visual <b>system.</b> Synthesis.
