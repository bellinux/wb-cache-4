40|$|This study {{opened up}} avenues for {{exploring}} the dismembering effects of trauma and the “re-membering” process of healing. Six participants engaged in a 60 - to 90 -minute semi-structured interview modelled after Elliot’s Change Interview. Utilizing the Listening Guide, the research team identified voices speaking about trauma and recovery. <b>The</b> <b>voices</b> were grouped into three categories: <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> trauma’s dismembering effects, <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> turning towards <b>the</b> pain, and <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> healing. Among <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> trauma’s dismembering effects were disconnection, dissociation, impasse, and pain. <b>Voices</b> <b>of</b> turning towards <b>the</b> pain included <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> active acceptance and <b>of</b> mourning. <b>Voices</b> <b>of</b> healing included <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> personal essence, integration, astonishment, agency, and calm and peace. Examining these voices, we traced patterns of shifting from fragmentation, aloneness, and numbness to wholeness, connection, and presence. This progression highlights the fulfilled potential of personhood through the transformational process of healing in therapy. TraumaHealingWholenessLifespan Integration therapyListening Guid...|$|R

5000|$|According to Gerardo Piña-Rosales, Director of the North-American Academy of the Spanish Language, [...] "in {{the poetry}} of Luis Alberto Ambroggio {{sometimes}} we hear <b>the</b> mournful <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> César Vallejo, <b>the</b> cryptic <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> Jorge Luis Borges, <b>the</b> tormented <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> Luis Cernuda, <b>the</b> loving <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> Pedro Salinas, <b>the</b> manly <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> José Hierro, <b>the</b> muted <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> Rilke, <b>the</b> ventriloquist <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> Fernando Pessoa". For Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky “the essential quality of Luis Alberto Ambroggio&#39;s poetry is immediacy: the vividness of images that feel unmediated, though we know they are, profoundly, the products of art. Here is a philosophical mind that insists always on the unfathomable primacy of encounter”.|$|R

40|$|It is {{increasingly}} recognised that Christian Churches and their Institutions {{have historically been}} sites where <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> survivors {{of child sexual abuse}} (csa) by Church personnel have not been effectively heard. This paper draws on data from a research project which sought <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> Church Leaders who were identified as being pro-active in addressing csa within their individual denominations. From this research several key inhibitors to hearing survivor’s <b>voices,</b> within Churches <b>of</b> Australia, were identified. These key inhibitors include the culture of Churches themselves, gendered ideologies, constructions of leadership and the deployment of forgiveness. The identification of such factors creates space to learn more effective strategies for hearing <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> survivors both within Churches and their organisations and externally. This paper goes beyond considering these factors to report on a collaborative project initiated, between Survivors Australia and Dr Death. This project specifically targets <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> Australian Survivors of csa by Church leaders. It is hoped that this project will not only achieve the primary objective of hearing and valuing <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> survivors of csa by Church leaders, but will also provide impetus for the creation of alternative ways of managing complaints of csa by Church leaders in Australia. Such complaints processes will be increasingly survivor focussed and include the creation <b>of</b> spaces where <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> survivors are valued...|$|R
