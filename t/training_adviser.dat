40|$|This thesis {{examined}} the relationship of six factors related to the growing problem of missed copy submission deadlines in high school yearbook programs. These factors were: a) the historical tendency for companies to deliver books on time despite missed deadlines, b) the ability of extra-curricular programs to meet deadlines vs. intra-curricular programs, c) the relationship of <b>adviser</b> <b>training</b> to missed deadlines, d) the relationship of complex pages to missed deadlines, e) the relationship of student involvement outside of school to missed deadlines, and f) the relationship of staff motivation to missed deadlines. Six states were identified to represent national trends in the yearbook industry [...] California, Florida, Indiana, Michigan, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. These states offered a regional balance {{as well as one}} inadviser training and in programs delivering books during different seasons. They also reflected the national shares of the major yearbook companies. Surveys were mailed to 1, 200 advisers, 200 in each state. Surveys were mailed to all sales representatives in these states from the six major companies. In addition, each company received a survey requesting statistical information used to define the problem in the study. Follow-up phone interviews were conducted with 13 advisers and 15 representatives. Interviews were also conducted with 12 company employees at three yearbook plants and three company executives by phone. The conclusions of the study showed that missed yearbook deadlines are most directly related to the adviser, his or her attitude toward deadlines, and his or her education and training. It is apparent that while other factors are involved in the issue of missed deadlines, the adviser is the key element in meeting those deadlines. The adviser provides staff motivation and education and is the common link from year to year. It is therefore concluded that <b>adviser</b> <b>training</b> and education is a responsibility of the school system in hiring <b>trained</b> <b>advisers.</b> Having <b>trained</b> <b>advisers</b> is also to the advantage of publishing companies.

50|$|Yan's {{efforts to}} stimulate Shanxi's economy mostly {{consisted}} of state-led {{investment in a}} broad variety of industries, and he generally failed to encourage private investment and trade. Though gains were made to improve the economy of Shanxi, his efforts were limited {{by the fact that}} he himself had little formal training in economic or industrial theory. He also suffered from a lack of experienced, <b>trained</b> <b>advisers</b> capable of directing even moderately complicated tasks related to economic development. Because most of the educated staff that he did have access to were solidly entrenched within the landed gentry of Shanxi, it is possible that many of his officials may have deliberately sabotaged his efforts for reform, preferring that the peasants working their fields continue their cheap, traditional labour.|$|R

In this study we aimed to identify and analyze the work done by academics to guide the stage of a training course for teachers of mathematics at a public university in southern Brazil.

Analyzes were guided by legal guidelines on the stage and authors such as Pimenta and Lima (2004), Pimenta (2006), Zabalza (2004) and Zeichner (2009). Among the results, we point out that the demand for labor of guiding is broad and often, these teachers do not have the minimum requirements to monitor and supervise the interns. The mismatch between the school calendar and timetable university was a limitation identified in the development stage of this course. We realized the need for a closer relationship between school and university and review of what refers to cooperative work between the two faculty advisers internship this course...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{provides}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} role of a management development and <b>training</b> <b>adviser</b> in a major U. K. Shipping, Transport & Trading Group during the decade of the 1970 s. The period was characterized by world-wide economic convulsions, political and social change and the emergence of information technology as a key facet of post-industrial society. The decade was to signal the end of British dominance in liner shipping. The study examines how the inter-related processes of management development and organization development were interwoven with the general processes of management. It also illustrates how a managerial system achieved an effective interlocking of the triad of managerial resources -the physical, financial and human resources. An interventions-oriented approach was aimed to achieve individual positive manager involvement for the effective interlocking of business planning with individual performance planning an inter-related performance appraisal system, embracing business and individual performance reviews and assessment the integration of manpower planning and career planning with strategic business objectives and corporate planning the introduction of management development programmes aimed to optimize the contribution of individuals in the achievement of profitability and growth the development of counselling and coaching skills and ongoing action programme to facilitate organization development, through systematic approaches to change the managerial style and behavioural pattern, and to enable managers to acquire competence in decision making skills and managing people...|$|E

However, this alliance begins to falter after subsequent clashes with Kamangan Special Forces robs the employers of their payment source. Several of the Afrikaners desert, while two others, including a sniper, are captured and cannibalized by the government troops.

40|$|Improving student {{satisfaction}} with academic advising {{has been the}} focus of university efforts in recent years. The academic advising conference between adviser and advisee normally occurs in a dyadic setting; thus, as with counseling, it seemed plausible to the authors that the interpersonal relationship between the adviser and student is important in developing a satisfying exchange. This document reports on a study which sought to <b>train</b> <b>advisers</b> to operationalize different counseling behaviors. Three <b>advisers</b> were <b>trained</b> to use attending behavior/no attending behavior, and self-disclosure/no self-disclosure to 60 subjects. Each student was randomly assigned to one of the four experimental manipulations. Significant main effects on the various variables in the experiment provided support that attending behavior and self-disclosure help strengthen the adviser-advisee relationship. Suggestions for future studies are reviewed. (Author/PC) - 40 N sr I Selected communication variables and their effect upon advisee {{satisfaction with}} adviser-advisee conference...|$|R
