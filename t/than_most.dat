He {{was known for}} his unusual build as a basketball player, stockier <b>than</b> <b>most</b> small forwards, yet shorter <b>than</b> <b>most</b> power forwards he faced. However, Barkley was still capable of outplaying both taller and quicker opponents because of his unusual combination of strength and agility.|$|E

5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at a quicker pace <b>than</b> <b>most</b> spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage.

He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|E

5|$|After {{experiencing}} {{fluctuations in}} the decades immediately after the independence of India, the economies of South Indian states have registered growth {{higher than the national}} average over the past three decades. While South Indian states have improved in some of the socio-economic metrics, poverty continues to affect the region as it does the rest of the country, although it has considerably decreased over the years.

5|$|Argentina {{abandoned}} {{the gold standard}} in December 1929, earlier <b>than</b> <b>most</b> countries. For much of the previous period, the country had operated a currency board, in which a body known as the caja de conversión was charged with maintaining the peso's value in gold. The devaluation of the peso increased the competitiveness of its exports and protected domestic production. Argentina saw {{the value of its}} exports drop from $1,537 million in 1929 to $561 million in 1932, but this was by no means the most severe downturn in the region.|$|E
