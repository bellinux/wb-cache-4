[...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> powerful person," [...] she told Forbes in 2011, when it named her 69th on its list of the world's hundred most powerful women. [...] "You know, what does it mean? It means you get a better seat in a restaurant or tickets to a screening or whatever it may be. But {{it is a wonderful}} opportunity {{to be able to help}} others, and for that I'm extremely grateful." ...|$|E
500|$|I've {{had this}} idea {{in my head}} for this show Tears of a Clown which is a {{combination}} of music and storytelling. Because {{at the end of the}} day I do <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> story teller. But it's rough as f---, [...] so bear with me and give me all the support you can. It's from the heart. I chose to debut this work in progress, this rough rehearsal, here in Australia because I feel so bad about cancelling on you guys the last time. I'm sorry. You've been so patient, you waited for so long, I feel like I owe you a present, so this is your present... I want to make a disclaimer... If anyone thinks they came here to see a finished final show, there's the door. This is some brand spanking new shit. I don't know if you like it raw.|$|E

2500|$|His {{influences}} include Brian Wilson and Phil Spector. Buckingham {{has also}} worked extensively {{as a producer}} both for Fleetwood Mac and for his solo work.“I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> stylist, {{and the process of}} writing a song is part and parcel with putting it together in the studio." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hawn {{has studied}} meditation. In a 2012 interview, she stated, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Buddhist. I was born Jewish, and I {{consider}} that my religion." [...] She also stated, [...] "It's not {{the idea of}} a particular religion that's important; it's the development of a spiritual life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard Berengarten's {{perspectives}} {{as a poet}} combine British, French, Mediterranean, Jewish, Slavic, American and Oriental influences. On his {{own work}} Berengarten says: [...] "I would rather <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> European poet who writes in English than as an 'English' poet."There is no civilisation without poetry. A poet’s responsibilities are social as well as subjective, communal as well as individual. Poetry, {{if it is not}} to caricature or betray itself, needs to involve critical commitment to both the past and future history of ‘all humanity’, and all nature. Berengarten is a popular reader of his own poetry, and a dynamic teacher.|$|E

5000|$|O'Brien {{was judged}} Scotland's {{eleventh}} most eligible man in February 2009 by a Scotland on Sunday panel. He once said: [...] "I actually find the heartthrob thing laughable," [...] adding: [...] "I am just a jobbing actor from Scotland and I don't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> particularly good looking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{of course}} not. You're not {{that sort of}} fellow at all. But I am. I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> living here with a dozen old fogies about the place all doing nothing, {{touching}} their hats, my-lording me at every turn, looking respectable, but as idle as pickpockets." ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Greenwood, {{he began}} playing bass out of necessity, {{teaching}} himself by playing along to New Order, Joy Division and Otis Redding. He said: [...] "We {{were people who}} picked up their respective instruments {{because we wanted to}} play music together, rather than just because we wanted to play that particular instrument. So {{it was more of a}} collective angle, and if you could contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool. I don’t <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bass player anyway. I’m just in a band with other people." [...] Among his musical influences are Booker T and the MGs, Bill Withers and Curtis Mayfield.|$|E
2500|$|Davis {{wrote her}} {{consumer}} books over a 40-year career, revising {{some in the}} 1970s. She saw herself as an [...] "interpreter," [...] not merely a researcher. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> newspaper reporter, who goes out to libraries and gathers information from hundreds of journals, which most people can't understand, and I write it {{so that people can}} understand." [...] She reviews scientific literature in the biochemical libraries at U.C.L.A., for instance. Her references for Let's Get Well totaled almost 2,500, many from cases during her nutrition practice, and she was upset when the publisher of Let's Have Healthy Children eliminated the 2,000 references from the 1972 revision, says author Daniel Yergin.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{his having}} {{personally}} described {{his work as}} [...] "Gonzo", it fell to later observers to articulate what the term actually meant. While Thompson's approach clearly involved injecting himself as {{a participant in the}} events of the narrative, it also involved adding invented, metaphoric elements, thus creating, for the uninitiated reader, a seemingly confusing amalgam of facts and fiction notable for the deliberately blurred lines between one and the other. Thompson, in a 1974 interview in Playboy addressed the issue himself, saying [...] "Unlike Tom Wolfe or Gay Talese, I almost never try to reconstruct a story. They're both much better reporters than I am, but then, I don't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> reporter." [...] Tom Wolfe would later describe Thompson's style as [...] "...part journalism and part personal memoir admixed with powers of wild invention and wilder rhetoric." [...] Or as one description of the differences between Thompson and Wolfe's styles would elaborate, [...] "While Tom Wolfe mastered the technique of being a fly on the wall, Thompson mastered the art of being a fly in the ointment." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2012 interview, Radcliffe stated: [...] "There {{was never}} [...] {{faith in the}} house. I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> being Jewish and Irish, {{despite the fact that}} I'm English." [...] He has stated: [...] "We were Christmas tree Jews", and that he is [...] "very proud of being Jewish".|$|R
5000|$|Of her work, Folwell has said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{each piece}} as an artwork that has {{something}} to say on its own, a statement about life. I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> being a contemporary potter and a traditionalist at the same time. Combining the two is very emotional and exciting to me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Richards has {{frequently}} {{stated that he}} feels less like a creator than a conduit when writing songs: [...] "I don't have that god aspect about it. I prefer to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> an antenna. There's only one song, and Adam and Eve wrote it; the rest is a variation on a theme." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is {{very nice}} {{to hear you say}} so," [...] the girl answered, taking the chair which, at Lady St. Maurice's motion, a servant had wheeled up to the fire. [...] "I like to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> {{belonging}} altogether to my mother and her people. I have been very unhappy with my father's relations." ...|$|R
5000|$|In his {{own words}} Koos said"I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> very basic [...] I am a craftsperson and I sew like that. I sew {{beautiful}} clothes. i am {{nothing more than a}} worker sitting behind a sewing machine. That's where I feel most comfortable, that's where I am the best. That's what I do best and it's very basic." ...|$|R
5000|$|Collins is a Democrat, {{describing}} his political views thus: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> slightly left <b>of</b> center, {{but my father}} {{thought of himself as}} slightly right of center, when he was slightly right of Genghis Khan. So who knows? I do know that I veer left when the right is getting out of hand, which they frequently do." ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{account was}} loosely adapted for the {{screenplay}} {{and development of}} the feature film Argo (2012). It was directed by Ben Affleck, who also starred as Mendez, and won an Academy Award as best picture. When interviewed in 2013 by ShowBizCafe.com, Mendez was asked his reaction to being portrayed by Ben Affleck, who is non-Hispanic. Mendez noted that losing his father when he was young meant he did not learn Spanish or much of his father's culture, and stated [...] "I don’t <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Hispanic. I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> person {{who grew up in the}} desert." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I don't want to {{turn into}} someone like David Cassidy. Most people's {{impressions}} of those kind of guys are that they're cheezers.

5000|$|Nye {{decided to}} go to New York City, where he worked in radio, playing various roles on soap operas. He recalled, [...] "I still <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> an actor. In the radio days, I was busy playing rotten Nazis, rich uncles and {{emotional}} juveniles -- the whole span -- and the only time I tried to be funny was at parties." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to Govind Nihlani, filmmaker, Purushottam Agrawal says, [...] "My novel is dark because I wrote it {{in a state}} of bechaini (anxiety). In truth, I would like to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> {{in a state of}} neither extreme pessimism nor optimism." [...] Nihlani had said that NACOHUS is deeply dystopian, making it hard to read. Nihlani compared this novel to George Orwell's novel 1984.|$|R
5000|$|Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet {{has said}} that: Of all the modern {{economic}} theories, {{the economic system}} of Marxism is founded on moral principles, while capitalism is concerned only with gain and profitability. (...) The failure of the regime in the former Soviet Union was, for me, not the failure of Marxism but the failure of totalitarianism. For this reason I still <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> half-Marxist, half-Buddhist.|$|R
5000|$|In 2016 {{he refused}} to apologise for saying {{that some of the}} refereeing {{decisions}} [...] "pissed me off" [...] in a post match interview on Sky Sports, instead declaring [...] "I speak my mind.

5000|$|When I see comedian — and ‘comedienne’, {{of course}} I hate it — I think ‘Oh, really?’ because I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> writer and broadcaster.

5000|$|In a 2014 interview, Adichie said on {{feminism}} and writing, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> storyteller, but I would not {{mind at all}} if someone were to {{think of me as}} a feminist writer... I'm very feminist in the way I look at the world, and that world view must somehow be part of my work." ...|$|E
5000|$|Under {{the impact}} of rape, battery and robbery in this jail I came to abandon my Quaker belief in pacifism; my {{depression}} gradually changed to anger at the jail and the government in general. This {{was a turning point}} in my consciousness; I came to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> an outlaw and began to adopt jailhouse attitudes. Eventually I accepted my identity as a punk and decided {{to make the best of}} it.|$|R
60|$|We {{could not}} tell from minute to minute whether we were {{planning}} for a world of solid reality, or telling ourselves fairy tales about this prospect of life. So much seemed possible, and everything we could <b>think</b> <b>of</b> so improbable. There were lapses when {{it seemed to me}} I could never be anything but just the entirely unimportant and undistinguished young man I was for ever and ever. I couldn't even <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> five and thirty.|$|R
