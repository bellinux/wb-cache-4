5|$|Yaoi and Yuri (also {{known as}} Boys' Love and Girls' Love, respectively) are Japanese genres {{incorporating}} homosexual romance themes across various media. The genres {{emerged in the}} 1970s in a branch of manga aimed at girls. Yaoi and yuri have spread beyond Japan: both translated and original yaoi and yuri are now available in many countries and languages. The characters in yaoi and yuri manga do not tend to self-identify as homosexual or bisexual. Famous works include Hiizuredokoro no Tenshi (The Angel that Came from the Sun), an 11-volume series beginning in 1980 that reinterprets {{the life of the}} introducer of Buddhism to Japan; and Kaze to Ki no Uta (Poem of <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Trees), a 17-volume series beginning in 1976 that chronicles the relationship between two schoolboys in France.|$|E
5|$|Cotes' {{ship was}} fit only to sail with <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> captain urged {{his men to}} make greater efforts to repair their ship before Uranie {{could come up with}} them again. So engrossed was the British crew with their repairs that it was not until 16:00 that it was {{realised}} that the French frigate was no longer holding station within sight, and had completely disappeared. This led some on the British ship to assume that Uranie had sunk, although in fact the ship had simply turned away {{in an effort to make}} it back to Rochefort to repair the damage suffered in the engagement. Also apparent were a number of sails in the distance. These rapidly approached and were revealed to be a frigate squadron flying the Union Flag. Cotes was unable to manoeuvre his ship or respond to the new arrivals, which were soon identified as French vessels wearing false flags. The leading frigate pulled up close to Thames and fired a broadside at the British frigate. Cotes immediately hailed the French, announcing that he was in no position to fight them due to the damage his ship had suffered and that he was striking his flag.|$|E
5|$|The {{technique}} of flight among procellariids depends on foraging methods. Compared {{to an average}} bird, all procellariids have a high aspect ratio (meaning their wings are long and narrow) and a heavy wing loading. Therefore, they must maintain a high speed {{in order to remain}} in the air. Most procellariids use two techniques to do this, namely, dynamic soaring and slope soaring. Dynamic soaring involves gliding across wave fronts, thus taking advantage of the vertical wind gradient and minimising the effort required to stay in the air. Slope soaring is more straightforward: the procellariid turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea. Most procellariids aid their flight by means of flap-glides, where bursts of flapping are followed by a period of gliding; the amount of flapping dependent on the strength of <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> choppiness of the water. Shearwaters and other larger petrels, which have lower aspect ratio, must make more use of flapping to remain airborne than gadfly petrels. Because of the high speeds required for flight, procellariids need to either run or face into a strong wind in order to take off.|$|E

5|$|There {{are very}} few {{material}} remains of the medieval town today. The city wall that surrounded the settlement has largely disappeared and is difficult to trace today, but from the remains of its foundations {{it does not appear}} to have been a substantial fortification. It was lightly built, with a thickness of perhaps , reinforced by rectangular towers. The three gates have left far more substantial remains. The eastern, southeastern and southern sides were fronted by a ditch of some , with the excavated soil dumped on the inner side and used to elevate the city wall. A small citadel was located in the southwestern corner of the town. The port was separated from the main town by a wall, and was situated in an excavated basin (today a swamp) and probably separated from the sea by an artificial mole and protected by extensions of the city walls. The entrance to the harbour was from the west, offering protection from both <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> coast's shoals.|$|E

25|$|At times, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fierce sea {{currents}} make sailing {{between the}} island and the mainland impossible. Sometimes boats are unable to reach or leave Bardsey Island for many days; in 2000 seventeen island visitors became stranded for two weeks when gales prevented a boat from going to rescue them.|$|E
25|$|Swell is {{generated}} when wind blows consistently {{over a large}} area of open water, called the wind's fetch. The size of a swell {{is determined by the}} strength of <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> length of its fetch and duration. Because of this, surf tends to be larger and more prevalent on coastlines exposed to large expanses of ocean traversed by intense low pressure systems.|$|E

25|$|The second {{race of the}} day {{suffered}} a 15-minute wind delay postponement, right as the boats hit the start line.

25|$|In 2005, {{architect}} Nikola Bašić built a Sea organ in Zadar, Croatia, {{which is}} an experimental musical instrument which plays music by way of sea waves and tubes located underneath a set of large marble steps. Concealed under these steps is a system of polyethylene tubes and a resonating cavity that turns the site into a huge musical instrument, played by <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sea. The waves create somewhat random but harmonic sounds.|$|E
25|$|On August 7, {{there was}} a fire between Batvači, Peroj and Barbariga, in the {{municipality}} of Vodnjan. It was localized around 7:30 PM by a Canadair CL-415 airplane and a helicopter that started extinguishing the fire around 6 PM. The fire, which was spreading because of <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> unapproachable terrain, was extinguished by 90 firefighters and 22 fire engines.

25|$|Michael Allmand {{was born}} in Golders Green, London, to Arthur John and Marguerite Marie Allmand on 22 August 1923. He was educated at Ampleforth College, a Catholic {{boarding}} school in North Yorkshire, England, before attending Oxford University in 1941 where he studied history. While at Oxford, Allmand served as the founding editor of a literary review journal called <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Rain, and began writing a biography of Edmund Burke.|$|E
25|$|Later on, {{wind tunnel}} study came into its own: the effects of wind on man made {{structures}} or objects needed to be studied when buildings became tall enough to present large surfaces to <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> resulting forces had to be resisted by the building's internal structure. Determining such forces was required before building codes could specify the required strength of such buildings and such tests continue {{to be used for}} large or unusual buildings.|$|E
25|$|Coppola was {{the third}} {{director}} to have two nominations for Best Picture in the same year. Victor Fleming {{was the first in}} 1939 with Gone With <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Wizard of Oz; Alfred Hitchcock repeated the feat the next year with Foreign Correspondent and Rebecca. Since Coppola, two other directors have done the same: Herbert Ross in 1977 with The Goodbye Girl and The Turning Point, and Steven Soderbergh in 2000 with Erin Brockovich and Traffic. Coppola, however, is the only one to have produced the pictures.|$|E

25|$|Although not yet widely used, {{tidal energy}} has {{potential}} for future electricity generation. Tides are more predictable than <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sun. Among sources of renewable energy, tidal energy has traditionally suffered from relatively high cost and limited availability of sites with sufficiently high tidal ranges or flow velocities, thus constricting its total availability. However, many recent technological developments and improvements, both in design (e.g. dynamic tidal power, tidal lagoons) and turbine technology (e.g. new axial turbines, cross flow turbines), {{indicate that the}} total availability of tidal power may be much higher than previously assumed, and that economic and environmental costs may be brought down to competitive levels.|$|E
25|$|Parts of the 1961 British film Whistle Down <b>the</b> <b>Wind,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two BBC {{television}} series All Quiet on the Preston Front and Juliet Bravo, were filmed in the town. Burnley Fire Station was {{the location of}} Social Services in the first series of Juliet Bravo, and Burnley Library was used for exterior shots of the magistrates' court in the series. Numerous locations in the town {{were used in the}} 1996–1998 BBC comedy drama Hetty Wainthropp Investigates. Ashfield Road, which runs between the Burnley College and DIY superstore, was used as a film location in the 1951 film The Man in the White Suit.|$|E
25|$|New England won {{the coin}} toss and drove 63 yards in 14 {{plays for the}} winning field goal, with Brady {{completing}} eight consecutive passes for 45 yards, including a 20-yard completion to J. R. Redmond and a 6-yard pass to Patten at the Raiders' 22-yard line on fourth down and 4 to keep the drive alive. While Vinatieri's game-tying kick had the wind at his back, this drive was into <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Patriots wanted to move closer. Following five runs from Antowain Smith for 15 yards and one from Brady for 2, and after a drive of more than eight minutes, Vinatieri and Walter cleared snow away from where the ball would be spotted. Vinatieri then gave New England its first lead of the game, making a 23-yard field goal to win.|$|E
