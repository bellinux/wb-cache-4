40|$|<b>Toxicovigilance</b> is {{the active}} process of {{identifying}} and evaluating the toxic risks existing {{in a community}} and evaluating the measures taken to reduce or eliminate them. It {{should be viewed as}} a useful complement to prevent poisoning. The section serves to enhance epidemiological surveillance for identification of poisoning/risk of poisoning in the community, the substances, circumstances, and the population involved in and to strengthen investigation of poisoning incidences of public health significance so as to implement control measures in a timely manner. Data mining of large databases, such as those of poison centers, can be extremely helpful by triggering signals for health authorities. So far, very few countries have set up structured <b>toxicovigilance</b> systems and it is anticipated that in future, national and international initiatives will help bridging this gap in our knowledge of the toxicity of many chemicals and commercial products to human beings...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Declared {{cases of}} {{exposures}} related to potential toxic agents are reported through a national database, the French Network of Poison Centers, and account on average for 200, 000 cases per year, including 75, 000 to 80, 000 symptomatic cases. These data are currently used to investigate signals from local, national or international institutional partners (such as hospitals, local health authorities, and the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed). Our {{objective is to}} complete this classical <b>toxicovigilance</b> activity through the automated detection of unexpected or unusual events {{in order to identify}} precociously signals representing potential threats for public health. To reach this objective, the inventory of surveillance and detection methods of unexpected events is necessary. METHODS: A literature review was conducted via Scopus(®) and Pubmed(®) databases, completed with grey literature and data available on worldwide vigilance systems' websites. RESULTS: The most commonly used methods are disproportional measures in the field of pharmacovigilance, some of which are subject to a routine detection at regular time intervals. Criteria of signal generation differ from one system to another, which have implemented data filtering strategies before or after analysis, in order to decrease the number of generated signals and improve their priority level. These signals are then transmitted to an experts committee for a clinical and epidemiological evaluation, and at times, for informing the patient's medical records. We also notice an interest in other approaches such as surveillance methods of temporal series or symbolic methods for associative rules extraction between one or more drugs and one or more adverse effects, with the possibility to include other types of variables, such a demographic data. The developments of probabilistic-based algorithms have also been recently developed, opening new opportunities. CONCLUSION: These surveillance and detection methods are of high interest for the automated detection of signals from the French <b>toxicovigilance</b> network. The initial step to developing these methods consists in studying the statistical quality of data and targeting the needs and expectations of the <b>toxicovigilance</b> network for what we want and what we can detect...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE This thesis {{aimed to}} assess the effect of an {{educational}} intervention using outreach academic detailing to promote poisoning treatment guidelines in rural hospitals. It also assessed the existing situation of poisoning and explored hospital staff behaviours that might affect treatment decisions. METHODS This thesis adopted mixed research approach. A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted to deliver an outreach education intervention to 46 peripheral hospitals in North Central Province of Sri Lanka. Quantitative analysis assessed the effect of intervention on changing treatment behaviour, epidemiology of poisoning and {{the validity of the}} hospital data for <b>toxicovigilance.</b> Qualitative methods explored social dynamics of rural hospitals. RESULTS The population incidence of acute poisoning is high in these rural districts. To monitor incidence and mortality, referral hospitals provide better <b>toxicovigilance</b> signals. There were improvements in poisoning treatment practices following outreach academic detailing workshops. These rural hospitals possess unique social dynamics which shape the treatment practices. CONCLUSION Acute poisoning is still a major public health issue in rural Sri Lanka. With changing patterns, referral hospital data is useful for monitoring purposes. Outreach academic detailing is effective in promoting poisoning treatment guidelines in rural hospitals. But high community influence may hinder attempts to improve treatment decision making. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney. UniKey credentials are required. Non university access may be obtained by visiting the University of Sydney Library...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the availability of}} information from poisons centres and other sources that would characterise the nature of accidental exposure to household chemical products to improve risk management. The DeNaMiC project was funded by European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) and {{was carried out by}} the poisons centres in Göttingen, Lille, London and Prague, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, the World Health Organization and the Health Protection Agency (UK). Method: The project involved developing an analytical tool to compare data on accidental poisoning obtained from the published literature, poisons centre annual reports and official mortality and morbidity statistics, and comparing and mapping the data collection and product classification schemes used by three poisons centres (Göttingen, Lille and London). A retrospective analysis of 3 years of enquiry data from Göttingen and Lille was also carried out to determine routinely available data on circumstances of exposure. European poisons centres were surveyed to {{determine the}} availability of data useful for product risk assessment. In addition, an analysis of published literature on <b>toxicovigilance</b> and a survey of <b>toxicovigilance</b> activities of European poisons centres was carried out. Finally, the project explored the feasibility of using poisons centres to obtain additional information about circumstances of exposure through a prospective followup study. Results: A range of publicly available data on accidental exposures was found; however, this provided little on the circumstances of exposure and could only be compared qualitatively. The product classification schemes used by three poisons centres showed some degree of comparability for household products. European poisons centres collected the same base data set but varied in collecting data relevant for risk assessment. European poisons centres varied in their understanding of ‘toxicovigilance’ but most stated that they perform it. It was possible to collect additional prospective data on exposures to household products relevant for risk assessment and management. Conclusions: Poisons centres are an important potential source of data useful for product risk assessment and management. In most cases, however, this requires additional work that needs to be resourced. Cooperation between poisons centres and industry can contribute to improving product safety...|$|E
40|$|Sulfonylureas are {{herbicides}} (Fig. 1) {{which will}} find increased use {{due to their}} wi-de-spectrum effects on weeds and their low toxic effects on mammals (1). The effects of sulfonylureas on plants, micro-algae and bacteria are due to the inhibition of acetolac-tate synthase (ALS) involved in the synthesis of acetolactic and butyric acids, which are the precursors of the branched-chain amino acids: isoleucine, leucine and valine (2). In-deed, ALS catalyzes the condensation of pyruvate with acetaldehyde by means of amine hydroxy-ethyl-thiamine diphosphatase. The final amino acid results from {{the transfer of the}} glutamate amino group to the -ketonic acid through transaminase (Fig. 2). Thus far, possible effects on humans have not been described and hence the interest in <b>toxicovigilance,</b> which consists of monitoring and listing possible incidents caused by new toxic agents such as pesticides. In vitro predicting biological tools are essential for estimating exogenous molecular toxicity at the subcellular level and enable to establish links between molecules and in vivo toxic effects (3). The aim of this work is to develo...|$|E
40|$|Background: Chemical {{exposure}} {{is a major}} health problem globally. Poison control centers (PCCs) play a leading role both in developed and developing countries in the prevention and control of poisonous chemical exposures. In this study, we aimed to assess {{the current state of}} PCCs in Pakistan and highlight capacity building needs in these centers. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of the two registered PCCs was done during August – December 2011. Necessary services of the PCCs were evaluated and the data were recorded on a predesigned checklist. Results: Both PCCs are affiliated to a tertiary care hospital. Clinical services to poisoned patients were available 24 hours a day / 7 days a week. Information on common local products was available to poison center staff. Both centers were involved in undergraduate and post graduate teaching. Telephone poison information service was not available in either of centers. There was a limited capacity for qualitative and analytical toxicology. Common antidotes were available. There were limited surveillance activities to capture toxic risks existing in the community and also a deficiency was observed in chemical disaster planning. Conclusion: PCCs in Pakistan need capacity building for specialized training in toxicology, <b>toxicovigilance,</b> chemical disaster planning, analytical laboratory tests and telephone service for consultation in poisoning cases.   How to cite this article: Khan NU, Mir MU, Khan UR, Khan AR, Ara J, Raja K, et al.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The acronym "ASHT" {{stands for}} "Alerting System and Development of a Health Surveillance System for the Deliberate Release of Chemicals by Terrorists". Imagine this scenario: 15 {{patients}} with respiratory symptoms following {{a concert in}} Rome and 12 patients coughing after lunch in a cafeteria in the Czech Republic; are these events related? Today these events would never be connected {{as there is no}} mechanism to allow EU Member States to share this type of information effectively. The main objective of the ASHT project was to improve data sharing between EU Member States. In part, this was achieved by an internet accessible EU-wide alerting system with the aim to detect the deliberate (i. e. criminal or terrorist) or accidental release of chemicals. Nevertheless more information from police, fire brigades and health professionals is needed. METHODS: Description of the design, development, functionality and testing of the relational database system called "RAS-CHEM" (Rapid Alert System for Chemicals). RESULTS: A database structure appropriate for the description of "events" with sophisticated retrieval functions was developed. For evaluation purposes 37 events were entered into the database including 29 scenarios and 8 historical mass intoxications. The alert level was "background information" for 21 events, "suspected mass intoxication" for 6 cases and "confirmed mass intoxication" for 10 events. CONCLUSION: The RAS-CHEM database works and will be integrated into the Health Emergency Operations Facility (HEOF) with other European Rapid Alert Systems. Poisons centres receive a large number of enquiries and could be important sentinels in this field of <b>toxicovigilance...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} tools, terminologies and systems used by poisons centres’ (PCs) to record {{information}} about exposures to chemical consumer products, {{to compare the}} information collected when documenting enquiries, and to assess {{the extent to which}} PCs collect information that is useful for industry and risk management. This study was carried out as part of Subcomponent 3 of the research project ‘Description of the Nature of Accidental Misuse of Chemicals and Chemical Products (DeNaMiC). Methods: A questionnaire was sent to European PCs and other institutions. The questionnaire was structured in six parts: Contact data; General information (tasks, customers and workload in terms of poisons enquiries); Documentation system (Documentation and further processing); Product information (sources, updates, handling); Documented cases (kind of information); <b>Toxicovigilance</b> Activity. Results: 26 replies were received from PCs and hospitals that give poisons advice in 19 countries. The product/chemical information system and the case documentation depend on national regulations and number and type of enquiries. Self-created, electronic databases for case records and for product information are common in European PCs even when product databases are provided by a governmental agency. PCs collect the same basic data set about cases (patient data, amount and physical state of chemical, exposure route). The circumstances of poisoning (location, use/ storage by the consumer, efficiency of Risk Management Measures (RMMs)) are not documented routinely in all PCs. A number of PCs use the INTOX definition to classify the “circumstances of exposure”. Conclusion: To gather Europe-wide data about poisonings e. g. for root cause analysis, to check the efficiency of RMMs, PCs need support from industry to maintain their knowledge about products. The classification of products needs improvement and harmonisation. Case documentation would need to be expanded to include some exposure factors, using standardised terminology...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dimethyl fumarate (DMFu) is a {{fungicide}} {{which is}} used in Chinese manufactures of furniture and shoes to avoid mould spoiling of fabrics. In 2008, DMFu was found the responsible allergen for several cases of contact dermatitis from armchairs and shoes observed in Europe. In France a national <b>toxicovigilance</b> survey was set up and importation of products containing dimethyl fumarate is now forbidden. Case report: a 36 year-old woman, with no history of previous allergy, was hospitalized because of a severe acute eczema of her feet after wearing {{a new pair of}} boots inside which she had noticed desiccant sachets. She strongly reacted on patch testing to DMFu and to the content of a sachet which was identified as DMFu, both at 0. 01 %, 0. 1 %, 1 % in petrolatum, and also to a piece of the fabric of her boots, patch tested as is. Materials and method: Boot fabrics and mould-proof sachets found in the boots were analysed by HPLC/UV/DAD and GC/MS after methanol extraction. Further samples of anti mould agent sachets or shoe fabrics from 5 other patients with suspicion of DMFu dermatitis were analysed with the same procedure. Some of them were transferred to the laboratory several months after healing of the dermatitis. Results: DMFu was found in all the samples from 1 to 100 % in sachets or from 20 to 2000 μg/g in the fabrics of shoes, even after one year. These findings contributed to ensure the responsibility of DMFu in the dermatitis of the patients and demonstrate that DMFu may remain {{a long time in the}} contaminated fabrics after removal of the sachets. This study also points out the usefulness of the collaboration between dermatologists, biologists and poison centre practitioners...|$|E
40|$|Background. Although {{there are}} {{extensive}} systems {{in place for}} pharmacovigilance, similar systems for detecting adverse health effects relating to pesticide exposure are rare. In 2004, the National Poisons Information Service (NPIS) pesticide surveillance study was implemented to identify cases requiring health care contact in the UK. This report describes the epidemiology of pesticide exposures reported to poison centres in the UK over a 9 -year period. Methods. Data on exposures were gathered through monitoring access to the NPIS's online clinical toxicology database TOXBASE® and through monitoring calls to the four NPIS units (Edinburgh, Cardiff, Newcastle and Birmingham). Severity was judged by both caller and NPIS staff. Results. During the 9 years, 34, 092 enquiries concerning pesticides were recorded; 7, 804 cases of pesticide exposure were derived from these enquiries. Exposures were predominantly unintentional and acute (6, 789; 87. 0 %); 217 (2. 8 %) and 755 (9. 7 %) were chronic unintentional and acute deliberate self-harm exposures, respectively. The majority of cases occurred in children, especially the 0 – 4 year age group The minimum incidence of pesticide exposure requiring health care contact was 2. 0 cases/ 100, 000 population per year. Reported numbers were 6 - to 25 -fold greater than those picked up through other UK pesticide <b>toxicovigilance</b> schemes. There were 81 cases of severe toxicity and 38 cases of fatal exposure. Deliberate self-harm accounted for 62. 3 % of severe cases and 79 % of deaths. Aluminium phosphide, paraquat, diquat and glyphosate were responsible for most severe and fatal cases. Conclusions. The data gathered from this pesticide surveillance study indicate that poison centre resources can usefully monitor pesticide exposures resulting in health care contact in the UK. The NPIS may usefully be one component of the UK's response to European legislation requiring surveillance of complications resulting from pesticide use...|$|E
40|$|Background: Poison Control Centre of Morocco (MPCC) plays a {{key role}} in {{promoting}} health. This study was aimed to demonstrate the role of the MPCC in improving public health and poisoning management. Methods: This was a retrospective study of poisoning cases reported to the MPCC between 1980 and 2011. The collected data included number of poisoning cases, profession of interlocutor who called the poison centre, time of poisoning (year), gender of poisoned patient, age of poisoned patient, toxic agent and intention of poisoning.   Data were analyzed using Epi Info software. The activities of MPCC were evaluated by three indicators including structural indicators, process indicators and impact indicators Results: Between 1980 and 2011, the MPCC received 401148 notifications which 73. 1 % of them involved scorpion stings and 26. 9 % were about other toxic agents. The main causes of poisoning, excluding scorpion stings, were pharmaceuticals (6. 1 %) followed by food (5. 9 %) and carbon monoxide (4. 5 %) poisoning. The MPCC devised five protocols through a consensual method and distributed to practitioners in hospitals around the country considering gastric emptying, management of PPD poisoning, management of scorpion stings, management of carbon monoxide poisoning and the management of snakebite. Gastric emptying decreased from 45 % to 4 % of cases during this period. A national strategy was set up for the management of scorpion stings leading to a decrease in mortality from 1. 54 % to 0. 22 %. Conclusion: During the period of more than two decades, the achievements of the MPCC have not been limited to providing toxicological information, but also activating a proper <b>toxicovigilance</b> system. In fact, a poison control centre is not a luxury structure. It is an integral part of every health system. Its impact on reducing morbidity and mortality is no longer discussed and its observatory role on poisonings should be strengthened.   How to cite this article: Rhalem N, Aghandous R, Chaoui H, Eloufir R, Badrane N, Windy M, et al.  Role of the Poison Control Centre of Morocco in the Improvement of Public Health.
