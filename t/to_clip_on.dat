50|$|Alpine: One {{problem with}} 1960s release {{bindings}} {{was that the}} boots were not standardized, and a binding that worked well on one boot might be dangerous on another, or might become dangerous over time as the boot shifted about. This led {{to the introduction of}} plate bindings, which used a metal plate firmly clipped to the sole of the boot, and bindings that clamped onto the plate. The plate could be easily removed for walking about. Plate bindings were popular in the US in the 1970s, notably the BURT Retractable Bindings and Spademan binding, but never caught on in any major way in Europe. As {{more and more of the}} alpine skiing market came under control of European companies, the plate bindings disappeared, in spite of their excellent safety records. The disappearance of the plate and alternate systems was due to a combination of factors, notably the introduction of standardized hard plastic boots. Plastic was first introduced by Lange as a way of improving existing leather designs. As the new material spread through the industry, the sole piece was standardized to allow toe-and-heel bindings <b>to</b> <b>clip</b> <b>on.</b> Plastic had the advantages of being much firmer than leather, not changing shape over time, and having predictable friction characteristics wet or dry. Although plate bindings of the era had much better safety records, notably the Spademan design, the new boots and bindings could be easily adapted to any ski for any skier.|$|E
5000|$|Adam Sweeting of The Arts Desk however, {{said that}} the tenth series [...] "hadn't been the finest of seasons, partly because the death of Richard Armitage's Lucas North {{at the end of}} Series 9 left a void which was never {{successfully}} filled. Lara Pulver never seemed comfortable as Erin Watts, Section D's new head, because she looked as if she'd been seconded from a modelling agency, while promoting Dimitri (Max Brown) up the batting order merely allowed him to become more faceless by the hour." [...] Andrew Pettie of The Daily Telegraph believed that Spooks is looking [...] "tattered and tired," [...] with a plot that is [...] "about as up-to-date as the Berlin Wall." [...] Pettie was also critical of the [...] "motion analysis filter," [...] a series-adopted technique for matching people by the way they walk. Pettie [...] "The rare moments of intrigue were dredged from Harry's past affair with a Russian double agent. There will no doubt be more double-dealing to come. But in recent years the most enjoyable bits of Spooks have also been the least plausible, as the scriptwriters really let their hair down and do something silly." [...] he rated the premiere episode two stars out of five. Tom Sutcliff of The Independent also rated the premiere episode two out of five, stating [...] "Spooks isn't even true to its own account of the world, let alone the one the rest of us inhabit. At one moment, a senior Russian minister was described as virtually unfollowable because of his wily knowledge of tradecraft.

5000|$|In the 1980s, {{the term}} B-roll was adopted for linear video editing using {{at least two}} video tape machines. Traditionally, the tape decks in an edit suite were labeled by letter, with the 'A' deck being the one {{containing}} the main tape upon which the main action material was shot. The 'B' deck was used to run tapes that held additional footage such as establishing shots, cutaway shots, and any other supporting footage. The sound was usually taken from the A deck alone, so that the B deck provided video without sound. As linear editing systems were unable <b>to</b> dissolve between <b>clips</b> <b>on</b> the same tape, an edit decision list (EDL) was used <b>to</b> mark <b>clips</b> as [...] "A-roll" [...] and [...] "B-roll" [...] to indicate source machines.|$|R

50|$|As in most digital {{non-linear}} editing applications, the Browser {{is not an}} interface to the computer's file-system. It is an entirely virtual space in which references <b>to</b> <b>clips</b> (aliases) are placed for easy access, and arranged in folders called 'bins'. Since they are only references <b>to</b> <b>clips</b> that are <b>on</b> the media drive of the computer, moving or deleting a source file on the media hard drive destroys {{the link between the}} entry in the Browser and the actual media. This results in a 'media offline' situation, and the media must be 'reconnected'. Final Cut Pro can search for the media itself, or the user can do this manually. If multiple clips are offline at the same time, Final Cut can reconnect all the offline media clips that are in the relative directory path as the first offline media clips that is reconnected.|$|R

It was later revealed that the car was on loan from the Petersen Automotive Museum. The segment was subsequently cut from Internet versions of the episode that were uploaded to Hulu and NBC.com, presumably so the network could avoid paying the licensing fees required for the Rolling Stones song.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{represents}} {{a case study}} which focuses on Poka Yoke which is a concept coined by Japanese people. We have studied a system that eliminated the rework and increased productivity of the plant which results in achievement of 0 PPM as well; in the company based in Satpur, Nashik. There was a punching machine there in the plant which was punching a hole on a rear end cap of Mahindra Scorpio’s rear bumper. There were 4 metal clips which were fitted on that component before the part gets punched on punching machine. After some of the lots get punched, we observed that component is getting punched unless those clip fittings. At that time, company needs more time <b>to</b> fit metal <b>clips</b> <b>on</b> the component again which was time consuming. So this problem can be avoided by implementing Poka Yoke system to it.
