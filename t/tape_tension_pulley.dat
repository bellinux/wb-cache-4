5000|$|A {{cassette}} tape {{contains a}} [...] "pressure pad" [...] of some type, usually made of felt (...) [...] This pad {{is within the}} cassette tape shell (located just behind the tape opening) and opposes the magnetic head of the cassette deck, providing pressure against the head(s) when the tape is being played. Nakamichi found that this pad provided uneven and fairly inaccurate pressure and was therefore inadequate for reliable tape/head contact. Furthermore, Nakamichi found that the pressure pad {{was a source of}} audible noise, particularly scrape flutter (the tape bouncing across the head, a result of uneven pressure), and also contributed to premature head wear.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{computing}} and information technology has enabled pervasive access to the World Wide Web. Over 280 EB of digital data has been generated {{from around the world}} and flowing in the digital universe; as a result, the need for data storage has grown rapidly. A variety of information storage solutions such as hard disk drive (HDD) products that are common information storages for personal computing are available in the market. Modern magnetic tape data storage in terms of its capacity and reliability has been employed as an ideal solution for enterprise-level storage of archival data with applications that include financial records, satellite images, and consumer databases. In magnetic tape technology, the thin, flexible media is transported between the supply and take up packs at a prescribed speed and tension, and over guides and the read/write head. As the tape is transported, in-plane vibration of axially moving tape, known as lateral tape motion (LTM), arises from excitation sources such as the run out of tape pack and impacts between the tape and the flanges on guides or packs. LTM has been identified as a major factor that degrades recording accuracy. Limiting the LTM is the one of the keys that enables the multi-terabytes data storage, and flanged roller guides are commonly implemented in modern tape drives. However, for higher recording density, thinner media is desirable. Reducing the thickness of media can significantly decrease its stiffness and increase the likelihood of damage to media edges by adjacent mechanical components on the guiding path. To avoid this, alternative tape guiding and actuation are required, and many advanced guiding mechanisms without the use of flanged guides have been developed to reduce lateral tape motion in industry and academia. The transverse force (tension) applied to the travelling tape is another key element of LTM dynamics and is controlled using the dynamics of tape pack driving sources in the modern tape drive products in using an open loop control logic. However, the developing advanced guiding and actuation technologies influence the tension irregularly and the current tension control algorithm is not able to handle the irregular changes of tension. An active tension control is required to feasibly advance LTM actuations. This thesis is motivated by the need for future engineering advances in guiding and actuation technologies for magnetic tape. Advanced guiding and actuation technologies have been developed to enable the active tension (transverse force) actuation of axially moving <b>tape.</b> An advanced <b>tension</b> actuation technology of axially moving media with dynamic tape path alternation using a novel rotary guider is considered in this thesis, and its effectiveness and technical feasibility is analysed in the context of actuating travelling <b>tape</b> <b>tension.</b> The specific issues addressed in this thesis are listed below. Development of linear magnetic tape transport system with an advanced active tension actuation. • A homemade linear magnetic tape transport system is developed. • The footsteps of development including technical design details of hardware and software are described. • A tape transport system that enables an actuation of travelling <b>tape</b> <b>tension</b> with dynamic <b>tape</b> path alternation using a novel rotary guider was purposely developed. • The tension is regulated actuating the amount of surface friction force between the tape and the rotary guider by altering the tape path dynamically rotating the rotary guider based on the feedback from strain gauge based tension sensor. Experimental studies of travelling <b>tape</b> <b>tension</b> shift phenomena with fixed tape path. • Parameter studies are carried to investigate the transitions of travelling <b>tape</b> <b>tension</b> during the <b>tape</b> transport process with the fixed angle of rotary guider (fixed tape path) in the travelling speed of tape and the angle of rotary guider. • Through experimental studies, it is found that the tension gradually increases as the tape is transported and the state of change in tension is heavily relay on the dynamics of tape pack driving source. • The angle of rotary guider shifts the level of tension. Generally, higher rotation angle of the rotary guider and the travelling speed of <b>tape</b> apply greater <b>tension</b> to the <b>tape.</b> Transverse force regulation with dynamic tape path alternation. • The effectiveness of tension regulation with dynamic tape path alternation using the rotary guider is investigated through experimental studies. • A closed loop control algorism of rotary guider controller is developed in order to control the operations of the rotary guider and implemented to the tape transport system. • The developed controller has a significant influence to the transition of tension. • The travelling <b>tape</b> <b>tension</b> is successfully regulated as targeted with the designed controller. It can be concluded that the rotary guider with a closed loop control algorism has an ability to actuate the travelling <b>tape</b> <b>tension</b> without relying on the dynamics of tape pack driving sources to control the tension...|$|R
50|$|Although {{variations}} exist, {{as noted}} below, most rear derailleurs have several components in common. They have a cage that holds two pulleys that guide the chain in an S-shaped pattern. The pulleys {{are known as}} the jockey pulley or guide pulley (top) and the <b>tension</b> <b>pulley</b> (bottom). The cage rotates in its plane and is spring-loaded to take up chain slack. The cage is positioned under the desired sprocket by an arm that can swing back and forth under the sprockets. The arm is usually implemented with a parallelogram mechanism to keep the cage properly aligned with the chain as it swings back and forth. The {{other end of the}} arm mounts to a pivot point attached to the bicycle frame. The arm pivots about this point to maintain the cage at a nearly constant distance from the different sized sprockets. There may be one or more adjustment screws that control the amount of lateral travel allowed and the spring tension.|$|R
50|$|Most systems {{include a}} brake {{to stop the}} wires from {{unravelling}} completely if a wire breaks or tension is lost. German systems usually use a single large <b>tensioning</b> <b>pulley</b> (basically a ratchet mechanism) with a toothed rim, mounted on an arm hinged to the mast. Normally the downward pull of the weights and the reactive upward pull of the tensioned wires lifts the pulley so its teeth are well clear of {{a stop on the}} mast. The pulley can turn freely while the weights move up or down as the wires contract or expand. If tension is lost the pulley falls back toward the mast, and one of its teeth jams against the stop. This stops further rotation, limits the damage, and keeps the undamaged part of the wire intact until it can be repaired. Other systems use various braking mechanisms, usually with multiple smaller pulleys in a block and tackle arrangement.|$|R

The goal {{of this study was}} to determine if intraoperative maximal urethral closing pressure (MUCP) elevation could be used as a reference value for adequate <b>tape</b> <b>tension</b> adjustment and predict transobturator (TOT) sling surgery outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was performed using MUCP measurements just before tape insertion and just after tension adjustment during surgery. Clinical data including preoperative urodynamic results were collected. The cure rate was determined by questionnaire. Patients were divided into two groups. The MUCP elevation group included patients with a MUCP elevation of more than 10 cmH 2 O before tape insertion; the others were regarded as the non-elevation group. The cure rate and pre- and postoperative clinical variables were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 48 patients had TOT surgery. The MUCP elevation group (n= 19) and the non-elevation group (n= 29) were similar with regard to patient characteristics and the preoperative parameters including age, mixed incontinence prevalence, Q-tip angle, peak flow rate, MUCP and the valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP). The mean follow-up period was nine months. The cure rate was significantly higher in the group with MUCP elevation than in the non-elevation group (84 % vs. 52 %, p= 0. 02). There was no significant difference in the mean postoperative peak flow rate between the two groups and there was no retention episode.

40|$|Within the {{research}} project 3 D-ThermoLay the Fraunhofer IPT {{has developed a}} completely new tape placement system especially for the manufacturing of three-dimensional fibre-reinforced components. The tape placement unit is a modular end-effector for robot systems to produce multi-layered parts based on fibre-reinforced thermoplastic tapes. The required main components of a laser-assisted tape placement unit are a laser guidance system with laser source, fibre optic cable with usually circular cores, laser zoom-optics, thermal camera for temperature-based control of the laser power and laser power control unit to heat up the thermoplastic tapes to their fusion temperature within their contact zone. During the manufacturing process the tape placement unit is moved along a mould to lay down the tapes and to consolidate the layers in situ to a rigid lightweight component by a consolidation roller. Because of the high stiffness of wider tapes (e. g. tape width of 25 mm) within the tape placement system six smaller tapes (tape width 6 mm, thickness 0. 15 mm) are used for the placement on double curved forms which opens {{a wider range of}} applications. By the application of smaller tapes instead of wider <b>tapes</b> the <b>tension</b> of each <b>tape</b> will be reduced during the placement process significantly. Especially the curved placement across the laying direction allows the decrease of radii laid by the tape placement system. For the fist time this effect was implemented in the designed tape placement head by the utilisation of 6 tapes with a width of 6 mm which can be processes simultaneously by the laser-assisted tape placement process. For successful processing each tape is guided and controlled individually by the <b>tape</b> <b>tension</b> control system. By this a homogeneous and uniform <b>tape</b> <b>tension</b> over all 6 tapes during the placement process is realized. With regard to the design of different placement strategies fibre-reinforced components with high complexity can be produced. Using the tape placement process especially large sized structure parts with radii exceeding 600 mm can be produced economically for example for aerospace, transportation or sports applications (e. g. aircraft or railway construction). Especially double curved structure components can be produced by the use of optimized system functions of the tape placement system which allows a flexible deposition of the tapes on complex surfaces...|$|R
