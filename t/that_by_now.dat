5|$|St. Clair {{continued}} his preparations for invading the northwest {{despite the fact}} <b>that,</b> <b>by</b> <b>now,</b> he admitted he was unfit for combat due to his ill health. Like Harmar, he was also unpopular in Kentucky, and Scott had to conduct a draft to raise the militiamen needed for St. Clair's expedition. He and most other officers in Kentucky claimed they were too ill to lead the men; most actually feared losing the respect of Kentuckians through their association with St. Clair. Colonel William Oldham was the highest-ranking soldier willing to lead the Kentuckians.|$|E
25|$|The {{order in}} which this occurredthe senate after the two prefectsindicates the {{significance}} <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>now</b> {{was attached to the}} office of Praetorian prefect as head of the Emperor's personal guard. Strabo would not remain prefect for much longer however, but for his services to the house of Augustus he was well rewarded by Tiberius. He took up a position in the emperor's consilium, and the same year gained his own son, Lucius Aelius Sejanus, as colleague in his prefecture. Together they commanded the Praetorian Guard from 14 until 15 or 16, after which Strabo was promoted to the highest office a Roman knight could attain, governor of Egypt. The length of his governorship is unclear, nor what happened to Strabo after this appointment, but {{it has been suggested that}} he died while in office.|$|E
25|$|His {{thoughts}} {{drifted to}} gloom and misanthropy. His mood was not improved {{by the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>now</b> there was no pretence of keeping up appearances: his marriage had failed. Years earlier he had grown resigned {{to the lack of}} love between him and Sarah. He had been visiting prostitutes and displayed more idealised amorous inclinations toward a number of women whose names are lost to history. Now in 1819, he was unable to pay the rent on their rooms at 19 York Street and his family were evicted. That was the last straw for Sarah, who moved into rooms with their son and broke with Hazlitt for good, forcing him to find his own accommodation. He would sometimes see his son and even his wife, with whom he remained on speaking terms, but they were effectively separated.|$|E

2500|$|Three {{million years}} ago saw {{the start of the}} Pleistocene epoch, which {{featured}} dramatic climactic changes due to the ice ages. The ice ages led to the evolution of modern man in Saharan Africa and expansion. The mega-fauna that dominated fed on grasslands <b>that,</b> <b>by</b> <b>now,</b> had taken over much of the subtropical world. The large amounts of water held in the ice allowed for various bodies of water to shrink and sometimes disappear such as the North Sea and the Bering Strait. It is believed by many that a huge migration took place along Beringia which is why, today, there are camels (which evolved and became extinct in North America), horses (which evolved and became extinct in North America), and Native Americans. The ending of the last ice age coincided with the expansion of man, along with a massive die out of ice age mega-fauna. This extinction, nicknamed [...] "the Sixth Extinction", has been going ever since.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 August 1952, Lawrence fainted {{backstage}} {{immediately after}} finishing a Saturday matinee of The King and I. After [...] "a few days at home," [...] wrote Aldrich, she {{was admitted to}} New York-Presbyterian Hospital for tests. Doctors said she was suffering from hepatitis, and she was admitted to a room on the 16th floor. Her former son-in-law, Dr. William G. Cahan, recalled in his 1992 memoir (by then he was a globally recognised medical expert on cancer) what happened next in 1952:She was admitted to New York Hospital [...] Her doctors were puzzled by what was described in the press as [...] "a liver problem," [...] and suspected {{that she might have}} cancer. Hearing this, and without Gertrude's knowledge, her husband consulted me. Not wanting to alarm her by appearing in person (she knew, of course, <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>now</b> I was a cancer specialist), I sent some of my colleagues as consultants. They, too, were puzzled, and ordered an exploratory laparotomy (abdominal operation).|$|E

2500|$|In a {{flashback}} depicted in [...] "The Beginning" [...] (2012), Rimmer is shown during his youth (played by Philip Labey) attending Io Polytechnic on Io, {{where one of}} his lecturers covering psychological profiling is the man he believes is his father, Lecturer Rimmer (now played by Simon Treves). After Rimmer is late for a lecture, Lecturer Rimmer uses Rimmer as a test subject in a social experiment regarding peer pressure. Three million years later, the hologrammatic Rimmer is seen on board Blue Midget being given the task of planning out a defensive strategy against a Simulant attack fleet; after failing {{to come up with}} one, Rimmer plays a recorded message from Lecturer Rimmer in an attempt to escape his feeling of being weighed down by his father's expectations. In the message Lecturer Rimmer, thinking <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>now</b> Arnold has achieved enough, reveals that Arnold is not his son, but that his real father was the family gardener Dungo. This revelation liberates Rimmer from the spectre of his lineage on the grounds that he has accomplished a great deal by the standards set by his biological father, and he is able to formulate a successful plan of attack that destroys the Simulant vessels before returning to Red Dwarf.|$|E
