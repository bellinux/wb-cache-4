25|$|Various {{petitions}} {{were filed}} between 1700 and 1703 with the Massachusetts government, {{demanding that the}} convictions be formally reversed.

But, he also included a statement from an investigator who did not believe the Fancher party was capable of poisoning the spring, given its size. Carleton invited readers to consider a potential explanation for the rumors of misdeeds, noting the general atmosphere of distrust among Mormons for strangers at the time, and that some locals appeared jealous of the Fancher party's wealth.|$|E
