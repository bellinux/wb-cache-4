There are two most important differences: changes in risk management and new <b>financial</b> instruments.

This has prompted some economists such as Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman to note that Europe is not suffering from a sovereign debt crisis but rather from a banking crisis.|$|E

According to the empicral results, the main factors influencing the quantity of Chinese automobile demand before <b>the</b> global <b>financial</b> <b>crisis</b> were <b>the</b> price of automobiles, the price of gasoline, the lending rate and the personal disposable income. The main factors of influencing the Chinese auto demand during <b>the</b> global <b>financial</b> <b>crisis</b> were <b>the</b> price of automobiles, the lending rate and the personal disposable income.
