40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Thrombosed</b> <b>external</b> <b>haemorrhoids</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} anorectal emergencies. They are associated with swelling and intense pain. Internal sphincter hypertonicity plays a role in the aetiology of the pain. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of an intrasphincteric injection of botulinum toxin for pain relief in patients with <b>thrombosed</b> <b>external</b> <b>haemorrhoids.</b> METHODS: Thirty patients with <b>thrombosed</b> <b>external</b> <b>haemorrhoids</b> who refused surgical operation were randomized into two groups. Patients received an intrasphincteric injection of either 0. 6 ml saline or 0. 6 ml of a solution containing 30 units botulinum toxin. Anorectal manometry was performed before treatment and 5 days afterwards. RESULTS: After 5 days of treatment, the maximum resting pressure fell in both groups, but was significantly lower in the botulinum toxin group (P = 0. 004). Pain intensity was significantly reduced within 24 h of botulinum toxin treatment (P < 0. 001), but only after 1 week in the placebo group (P = 0. 019). CONCLUSION: A single injection of botulinum toxin into the anal sphincter seems to be effective in rapidly controlling the pain associated with <b>thrombosed</b> <b>external</b> <b>haemorrhoids,</b> and could represent an effective conservative treatment for this condition.

40|$|Abstract Background It is {{important}} {{to better understand the}} aetiology of <b>thrombosed</b> <b>external</b> <b>haemorrhoids</b> (TEH) because recurrence rates are high, prophylaxis is unknown, and optimal therapy is highly debated. Findings We conducted a questionnaire study of individuals with and without TEH. Aetiology was studied by comparison of answers to a questionnaire given to individuals with and without TEH concerning demography, history, and published aetiologic hypotheses. Participants were evaluated consecutively at our institution from March 2004 through August 2005. One hundred forty-eight individuals were enrolled, including 72 patients with TEH and 76 individuals without TEH but with alternative diagnoses, such as a screening colonoscopy or colonic polyps. Out of 38 possible aetiologic factors evaluated, 20 showed no significant bivariate correlation to TEH and were no longer traced, and 16 factors showed a significant bivariate relationship to TEH. By multivariate analysis, six independent variables were found to predict TEH correctly in 79. 1 % of cases: age of 46 years or younger, use of excessive physical effort, and use of dry toilet paper combined with wet cleaning methods after defaecation were associated with a significantly higher risk of developing TEH; use of bathtub, use of the shower, and genital cleaning before sleep {{at least once a week}} were associated with a significantly lower risk of developing TEH. Conclusion Six hypotheses on the causes of TEH have a high probability of being correct and should be considered in future studies on aetiology, prophylaxis, and therapy of TEH. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction:External {{hemorrhoids}} {{are located}} {{outside of the}} dentate line and covered by anoderm. <b>Thrombosed</b> <b>external</b> hemorrhoids {{are one of the}} frequent acute anorectal diseases which are treated successfully in the proctology outpatient room. The etiology of this disease is still unknown. Knowledge of the etiology of <b>thrombosed</b> <b>external</b> hemorrhoids could prevent recurrence of this disease and help prepare good prophylaxis. Material/Methods:A group of 50 patients with a diagnosis of <b>thrombosed</b> <b>external</b> hemorrhoids and treated in the Mikolaj Pirogow Regional Specialist Hospital in Lodz was interviewed by means of the authorâ€™s own questionnaire concerning demography and published hypothesis. The necessary statistics were conducted by means of STATISTICA 7. 1 and EXCEL 2008 programs. Results:The analysis of the survey results shows a significant relationship of <b>thrombosed</b> <b>external</b> hemorrhoids and presence of internal hemorrhoids, practice of anoreceptive sex and consumption of more alcohol products than usual. There was no statistical relationship between lifting heavy objects, eating spicy food, having hard stools or straining at toilet during motions and <b>thrombosed</b> <b>external</b> hemorrhoids. Conclusions:This study confirmed three hypotheses on the causes of <b>thrombosed</b> <b>external</b> hemorrhoids which were presented in medical journals available in the MEDLINE database. The author of this article believes {{that it is necessary to}} conduct a multi-center study, which would explain the exact etiology of this disease.

40|$|Haemorrhoids {{are one of}} {{the most}} common anal {{disorders}} encountered in primary care. Haemorrhoids are defined as the symptomatic enlargement and distal displacement of the normal anal cushions. 1 These cushions are usually found in three main locations: left lateral, right anterior, and right posterior (3, 7 and 11 o'clock positions). 2 These vascular cushions participate in the drainage of the anal canal. It has also been suggested that these cushions intensify the action of the anal sphincter mechanism, thereby contributing to continence. There are two types of haemorrhoids: internal and <b>external.</b> Internal <b>haemorrhoids</b> arise above the dentate line, are viscerally innervated and therefore painless. <b>External</b> <b>haemorrhoids</b> can be painful because they originate below the dentate line and have a somatic innervation. 3 Internal haemorrhoids are further subdivided according to the degree of prolapsed. peer-reviewe...|$|R
50|$|If not <b>thrombosed,</b> <b>external</b> {{hemorrhoids}} {{may cause}} few problems. However, when thrombosed, hemorrhoids {{may be very}} painful. Nevertheless, this pain typically resolves {{in two to three}} days. The swelling may, however, take a few weeks to disappear. A skin tag may remain after healing. If hemorrhoids are large and cause issues with hygiene, they may produce irritation of the surrounding skin, and thus itchiness around the anus.|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of anal protrusions in {{children may be}} difficult, because the protrusion often occurs only after defaecation, and is usually invisible during the consultation. We present three cases of children with rectal prolapse (4 -year-old boy), polyp (4 -year-old boy), and <b>external</b> <b>haemorrhoids</b> (3 -year-old boy), respectively. In each case, the diagnosis could be made after parents had sent {{a picture of the}} phenomenon. The first patient recovered after laxative therapy, the second after polypectomy, and in the third patient, the haemorrhoid persisted, despite laxative therapy and physiotherap...|$|R
5000|$|Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is a {{surgical}} excision of the hemorrhoid used primarily only in severe cases. It {{is associated with}} significant postoperative pain and usually requires 2-4 weeks for recovery. However, the long-term benefit is greater in those with grade 3 hemorrhoids as compared to rubber band ligation. It is the recommended treatment in those with a <b>thrombosed</b> <b>external</b> hemorrhoid if carried out within 24-72 hours. Glyceryl trinitrate ointment after the procedure helps both with pain and healing.|$|R

Methods: A prospective cohort study of 72 adults with TEH was conducted: no surgery, no sitz baths but gentle dry cleaning with smooth toilet paper after defecation. Follow-up information was collected six months after admission by questionnaire. Results: Despite our strict conservative management policy 62. 5 % (45 / 72) of patients (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 51. 0 &ndash; 74. 0) described themselves as &ldquo;healed&rdquo; or &ldquo;ameliorated&rdquo;, and 61. 1 % (44 / 72, 95 % CI: 49. 6 &ndash; 72. 6) found our management policy as &ldquo;valuable to test&rdquo; or &ldquo;impracticable&rdquo;. 13. 9 % (10 / 72, 95 % CI: 5. 7 &ndash; 22. 1) of patients suspected to have recurrences. 4. 2 % did not know. Twenty-two of the 48 responding patients reported symptoms such as itching (18. 8 %), soiling (12. 5 %), pricking (10. 4 %), or a sore bottom (8. 3 %) once a month (59. 1 %, 13 / 22), once a week (27. 3 %, 6 / 22), or every day (13. 6 %, 3 / 22). Conclusions: The dictum that surgery is {{the gold standard}} for therapy for TEH should be checked by randomized controlled trials.

40|$|Two unusual {{cases of}} iliac vein {{spontaneous}} rupture into the retroperitoneum are presented together with 18 cases {{reported by the}} literature.
