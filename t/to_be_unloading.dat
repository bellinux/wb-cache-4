500|$|During {{the second}} half of 1978, Vietnamese leaders devoted much of their energy towards the {{military}} campaign against the Khmer Rouge regime, by seeking political support from the Soviet Union. In a briefing with Vietnamese Foreign Ministry officials on 25 July 1978, the Soviet chargé d'affaires in Hanoi was told that the Kampuchean Government had deployed 14 of its 17 regular army divisions and 16 local regiments along the border with Vietnam. Then, in early September 1978, Lê Duẩn informed the Soviet ambassador that Vietnam aimed to [...] "solve fully this question of Kampuchea by the beginning of 1979". While Vietnam was laying the political foundation for the military campaign against Kampuchea, Soviet ships were reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unloading</b> military hardware and ammunition in Cam Ranh Bay. In October 1978, Vietnamese radio broadcast what they claimed were accounts of uprisings against the Khmer Rouge regime, urging members of the Kampuchean military either to overthrow the [...] "Pol Pot-Ieng Sary clique" [...] or defect to Vietnam.|$|E
500|$|The Guardians Alex Macpherson {{praised the}} song, writing [...] "the {{magnificent}} Side Effects finds Carey {{at the height}} of her powers. Over synths as slow as molasses, she intones some of the darkest lyrics of her career, a meditation on the long-term effects of an abusive relationship. Verbose to the point of opulence, she crams syllables into the verses, races against her own emotions and perfectly conveys the song's claustrophobic intensity." [...] Joey Guerra from the Houston Chronicle singled out [...] "Side Effects" [...] as [...] "an electro-tinged standout" [...] in his review of the album. He praised Storch and Young Jeezy for giving the song a [...] "menacing mood". Writing for Fox News, Roger Friedman described Carey's vocals performance as [...] "gorgeous", Jeezy's rap verse as [...] "cool" [...] and the hook as having Top 40 appeal. He continued to write that Mottola would most likely do a spit-take upon hearing the lyrics. Describing the song as [...] "a not-so-thinly-veiled swipe" [...] at Mottola, Evan Sawdey of PopMatters thought that the lyrical content would [...] "raise some eyebrows". The New York Times writer Ben Ratliff labeled the track as a [...] "drama bomb" [...] which recounts how Carey lived under the spell of Mottola during their marriage. The Washington Posts J. Freedom De Luc thought that [...] "Side Effects" [...] was one of the albums highlights along with [...] "Touch My Body" [...] and [...] "I Wish You Well", and continued to write that Carey appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unloading</b> onto her ex-husband. Nick Levine from Digital Spy described the song as Carey's revenge on Mottola, and [...] "her rawest, most personal track in years". Jayanthi Daniels of The New York Sun was critical of [...] "Side Effects" [...] as well as [...] "I'm That Chick", describing them as [...] "throwaway pop tracks" [...] on a hip-hop album.|$|E

50|$|The city's {{early growth}} was {{influenced}} by the fact that river boats had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unloaded</b> and moved downriver before reaching the falls.

50|$|In late 2011, Afghanistan {{opened its}} first major railway line, linking Hairatan, on the Uzbek border, with Mazar-i-Sharif.

This was an expensive and inefficient process.|$|R

50|$|XP-100 pistols and Remington Model 600 rifles were {{recalled}} in 1979 {{because of a}} safety issue.

Due to the longer crossing times the timetable was altered with departures from every second day from Malmö and Lübeck, with overnight crossings.|$|R
50|$|In May 2008, Cyclone Nargis struck Burma; {{the worst}} natural {{disaster}} {{to hit the}} region.

50|$|During the 2002 West Coast port labor lockout, {{the port}} {{had a large}} backlog of ships waiting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unloaded</b> at any given time.
