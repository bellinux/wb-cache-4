5|$|Like Hitler, Goebbels practiced {{his public}} {{speaking}} skills {{in front of}} a mirror. Meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing, and the venues were decorated with party banners. His entrance (almost always late) was timed for maximum emotional impact. He usually meticulously planned his speeches ahead of time, using pre-planned and choreographed inflection and gestures, but he was also able to improvise and adapt his presentation <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> connection with his audience.|$|E
5|$|As aforesaid, SVT wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> use of Malmo Arena's {{space to}} {{highlight}} the performances and increase the audience's visibility compared to previous years. SVT created a main stage and a smaller stage with higher-lower shifted floors, connected by a trail closely surrounded by a standing crowd {{from both sides of}} it and around the small stage. The main stage mobility was expressed as a main artistic medium at the opening act of the second semifinal and with highlighting Moldova's performance towards its finish, as a movable part beneath the singer's dress making her look gradually taller. The small stage mobility highlighted United Kingdom's performance towards its finish, lifted above the close-standing audience.|$|E
5|$|At 2100 UTC August 16, 2007 a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Puerto Rico. At 0300 UTC August 17 this advisory was upgraded to {{a tropical}} storm warning. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, eager <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> showing after its heavily criticized response to Hurricane Katrina, deployed a Federal Incident Response Support Team to the unincorporated territory of the United States ahead of Hurricane Dean. This five-member team of disaster management experts was equipped with satellite communication systems to provide video-teleconferencing and help make real-time assessments of any damage.|$|E

5|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) invites the office to a Diwali celebration, where Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) struggles <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> impression on Kelly's parents and Michael Scott (Steve Carell) considers taking his relationship with Carol Stills (Nancy Carell) to the next step. Meanwhile, at the Stamford branch, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) get drunk while working late, leading Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) to give Jim a ride home.|$|E
5|$|Holst's {{comic opera}} The Perfect Fool (1923) was {{widely seen as}} a satire of Parsifal, though Holst firmly denied it. The piece, with Maggie Teyte in the leading soprano role and Eugene Goossens conducting, was enthusiastically {{received}} at its premiere in the Royal Opera House. At a concert in Reading in 1923, Holst slipped and fell, suffering concussion. He seemed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> recovery, and he felt up to accepting {{an invitation to the}} US, lecturing and conducting at the University of Michigan. After he returned he found himself more and more in demand, to conduct, prepare his earlier works for publication, and, as before, to teach. The strain caused by these demands on him was too great; on doctor's orders he cancelled all professional engagements during 1924, and retreated to Thaxted. In 1925 he resumed his work at St Paul's Girls' School, but did not return to any of his other posts.|$|E
5|$|On June 22, 2010, {{the town}} of Lyndhurst put forward a {{proposal}} to buy the station depots at both Kingsland and Lyndhurst stations. The mayor of Lyndhurst, Richard DiLascio, said that the stations have seen better days and New Jersey Transit {{has no interest in}} renovating both buildings. Design plans for Kingsland station look towards a new coffee shop, after repairing and renovating the building. The station would also be converted from its old subway tile to a newer retro look for the building, paid for by leasing the building. Because an average of 440 to over 1,000 people use the Kingsland station daily, it would look better for {{the town of}} Lyndhurst <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> impression on the riders. Asof 2012, the station house was unoccupied. The town of Lyndhurst has requested that NJT lease the building to the municipality so that it might be renovated and brought into use as a way to revitalize the immediate vicinity.|$|E

5|$|This {{technology}} {{is widely used}} in confirming venous pathology diagnoses. The imaging capability needed, was made possible with the developments of Doppler and color Doppler. Doppler measurements using Doppler effect can show {{the direction of the}} blood flow and its relative velocity and color Doppler is the provision of color to help interpret the image, showing for example, the blood flow towards the probe in one color and that flowing away another. Whilst the equipment itself is costly, the procedure is not. Apart from the scanner, different probes are required according to the depth to be studied. A gel is used with the probe <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> acoustic impedance contact. The training and expertise of the examiner is important because of the many technical complications that can present. Venous anatomy for example, is not constant, for example a patient's vein layout of the right limb is not identical to that of the left limb.|$|E
5|$|James Spader reprises {{his role}} as Robert California, the new CEO of Dunder Mifflin/Sabre. Andy is then {{promoted}} to Regional Manager and works hard <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> impression on Robert, and asks Dwight to be his number two. Pam and Jim are expecting their second child, Phillip, {{at the start of}} the season, to coincide with Fischer's real life pregnancy. Angela is pregnant with her first son, also named Philip, with State Senator Robert Lipton (although it is implied that Dwight Schrute is actually the child's biological father). Darryl starts falling for new warehouse foreman Val. Dwight is tasked with traveling to Tallahassee, Florida in order to assist Sabre Special Projects Manager Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) in launching a chain of retail stores, along with Jim, Ryan, Stanley, Erin, and new office temp Cathy Simms. Cathy is also revealed to have ulterior motives for the trip, as she intends to seduce Jim, but fails. Robert later kills the retail store project, and Erin decides to stay in Florida as an elderly woman's live-in helper. Andy goes to Florida and wins back Erin, but this allows Nellie to claim the manager position as her own. Robert tells Andy that he has been demoted back to a salesman, but he refuses to accept the news, which causes him to be fired. Andy becomes motivated to begin a Dunder Mifflin comeback and joins with former CFO, David Wallace, to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre, putting Sabre completely out of business and giving Andy the manager position once again.|$|E

25|$|This argument, {{that the}} {{condemnation}} of Joan had stained the king's honor, was enthusiastically taken up {{two years later}} with a man keen <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> impression of Charles VII – the cardinal Guillaume d'Estouteville. d'Estouteville was the Papal legate in France appointed by Pope Nicholas V in 1451 to negotiate an Anglo-French peace. His commission was hampered by two things: the ongoing success of the French army in throwing the English out of Normandy, and the ongoing debates about the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges.|$|E
25|$|The railway {{also had}} tourist potential. In 1906, Thomas Cook & Son travel agency advertised {{trips to the}} Holy Land {{utilizing}} the valley line. A notable package was a trip using the valley line from Haifa to Samakh, where the tourists would take a steam boat to Tiberias via the Sea of Galilee and explore the Christian holy sites around the lake. When the line became popular with tourists, the travel conditions were improved in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> first impression to dignitaries and aristocrats from all over Europe. In 1912, first and second class cars were introduced.|$|E
25|$|The Hemings {{children}} were named {{for people in}} the Randolph-Jefferson family or who were important to Jefferson, rather than {{for people in the}} Hemings family. When mixed-race {{children were}} sired by the master, they were frequently named after people from his family. Jefferson gave the Hemings family special treatment: the three boys while young had very light household duties. At working age, they were each apprenticed to the master carpenter of the estate, the most skilled artisan, who was also their uncle. This would provide them with skills <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> living as free adults.|$|E

25|$|In these interviews, Morton {{claimed to}} have been born in 1885. He was aware that if he had been born in 1890, he would have been {{slightly}} too young <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> case for being the inventor of jazz. He {{said in an interview that}} Buddy Bolden played ragtime but not jazz, a view not accepted by Bolden's other New Orleans contemporaries. The contradictions may stem from different definitions of the terms ragtime and jazz. These interviews, released in different forms over the years, were released on an eight-CD boxed set in 2005, The Complete Library of Congress Recordings. The collection won two Grammy Awards. The same year, Morton was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.|$|E
25|$|The Fall of Kaifeng {{boosted the}} morale of the Jurchens, and they {{attempted}} a third invasion. Gaozong saw little intention <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> defense against the Jurchens. He felt the strong generals around him would make him vulnerable and wanted them to lose to remove the threat. Han facing enormous odds, was beaten off for the first time. Many of the Song generals, disgusted by the cowardly emperor, began to retaliate, and Han had to gather up what was left of his force and protect the throne. He successfully captured the renegade generals and scattered their forces. It is stated that Han actually condemned the emperor and that the emperor apologized and finally showed signs of better supporting the generals defending China.|$|E

Rosamond, who is well-educated and seeks <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> match, decides to marry Lydgate and uses Fred's {{sickness}} {{as an opportunity to}} get close to the doctor. Though he initially views their relationship as pure flirtation, Lydgate backs away from Rosamond after discovering that the town considers them practically engaged. However, after seeing her a final time, he breaks his resolution to abandon his relationship with Rosamond and the two become engaged. At roughly the same time, Casaubon, returned from Rome, suffers a heart attack. Lydgate is brought in to deal with him and informs Dorothea that, in all likelihood, Casaubon only has around fifteen years left if he takes it easy and ceases his studies. Meanwhile, as Fred recovers, Mr. Featherstone becomes ill. On his deathbed, he reveals that he has two wills and tries to get Mary to help him destroy one. Unwilling to be mixed up in the business of his will, she refuses, and Featherstone dies with the two wills still intact.|$|E

25|$|He {{defeated}} Daniel Köllerer, 6–3, 6–0, in {{the second}} round of BNP Paribas Open, earning his first hard-court victory of the season, losing only eight points on serve. He then faced Juan Mónaco in the third round, their third meeting in a row, with Ferrero prevailing in the other two. He was upset, 6–7(2–7), 6–3, 3–6, in a match that lasted over three hours. At the Sony Ericsson Open, he made the round of 16, losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, 2–6, 2–6, after defeating John Isner, 6–2, 3–6, 6–3, and Daniel Köllerer, 4–0 RET. At the Monte Carlo Masters, he defeated Marcel Granollers, 6–0, 6–3, and Benjamin Becker, 6–3, 6–4. After defeating the German, Ferrero upset Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, 6–1, 3–6, 7–5, earning his first victory over the Frenchman. He, however, lost to Rafael Nadal, 4–6, 2–6, in the quarterfinals. At the Barcelona Open, Ferrero was upset by Dutchman Thiemo de Bakker in the third round, due to not playing well in the tie-breaks, 6–7(2–7), 6–3, 6–7(4–7),. At the Rome Masters, his form worsened as he surprisingly slumped to a 0–6, 3–6 loss to qualifier Santiago Giraldo in the first round. Ferrero went into the French Open seeded 16th and tipped by some <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> run in the tournament. He defeated Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay in the first round, 6–4, 6–3, 6–1. He then met fellow Spaniard Pere Riba {{in the second}} round, winning in four sets, 7–6(7–5), 6–7(13–15), 6–2, 6–2. However, he was upset in the third round by unseeded American Robby Ginepri. After coming back from a two-set deficit and being a break of serve up in the decider, Ferrero lost in the fifth set with a final score of 7–5, 6–3, 3–6, 2–6, 6–4. He may have been seen to have underachieved in the tournament but did improve on his previous year's performance and did therefore increase his ranking points.|$|E
