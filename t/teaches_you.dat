500|$|Smythe's {{father died}} in 1947 at 86 years of age. Smythe had had a {{rapprochement}} with his father, seeing him at Christmas and at times when Albert came to Toronto to preach. After his father's death, Smythe joined the Theosophical Society and remained a member for life. In 1977, Smythe explained why he was a theosophist: [...] "It's because a theosophist <b>teaches</b> <b>you</b> that ya can't {{get away with anything}} in this life anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|During an interview, Ryan O'Neal {{recalled}} Kubrick's directing style: [...] "God, {{he works}} you hard. He moves you, pushes you, helps you, gets cross with you, {{but above all}} he <b>teaches</b> <b>you</b> {{the value of a}} good director. Stanley brought out aspects of my personality and acting instincts that had been dormant... My strong suspicion [...] that I was involved in something great". He further added that working with Kubrick was [...] "a stunning experience" [...] and that he never recovered from working with somebody of such magnificence.|$|E

500|$|Moore {{frequently}} {{moved around}} the United States as a child, due to her father's occupation. She was close to her family as a result, but has said she never had the feeling of coming from one particular place. The family lived in multiple locations, including Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Panama, Nebraska, Alaska, New York, and Virginia, and Moore attended nine different schools. The constant relocating made her an insecure child, and she struggled to establish friendships. Despite these difficulties, Moore later remarked that an itinerant lifestyle was beneficial to her future career: [...] "When you move around a lot, you learn that behavior is mutable. I would change, depending on where I was... It <b>teaches</b> <b>you</b> to watch, to reinvent, that character can change." ...|$|E
500|$|Lead actress Anna Torv later cited two {{scenes in}} [...] "Marionette" [...] {{of which she}} was most proud of during her time on Fringe. The first was Olivia's {{discovery}} that Peter was sleeping with Fauxlivia and her reaction— going through all of her clothes in disgust; the second related to her comment to Peter that she couldn't [...] "believe that you didn't know it was me." [...] Torv explained, [...] "The reason I love those scenes is because it’s really easy to be great in your own bedroom , {{but when you get}} on set you have so many different obstacles. The scene with Peter and me outside was done at like 1:30 in the morning, in the middle of town, so we had piles of drunk people screaming up and down the street, and massive fire engines and trucks coming through…. We're doing this quiet scene where I have to cry and we're on the clock, but that’s what TV <b>teaches</b> <b>you</b> -– to just go with it very quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|Richardson {{had gained}} a {{national}} {{reputation as a}} great actor while at the Old Vic; films gave {{him the opportunity to}} reach an international audience. Unlike some of his theatre colleagues, he was never condescending about film work. He admitted that film could be [...] "a cage for an actor, but a cage in which they sometimes put a little gold", but he did not regard filming as merely a means of subsidising his much less profitable stage work. He said, [...] "I've never been one of those chaps who scoff at films. I think they're a marvellous medium, and are to the stage what engravings are to painting. The theatre may give you big chances, but the cinema <b>teaches</b> <b>you</b> the details of craftsmanship." [...] The Fallen Idol was followed by Richardson's first Hollywood part. He played Dr Sloper, the overprotective father of Olivia de Havilland in The Heiress, [...] based on Henry James's novel Washington Square. The film did not prosper at the box-office despite good reviews, [...] an Academy Award for Best Actress for Havilland, and nominations for the director (William Wyler) and Richardson.|$|E

[...] "A reason —a reason why man cannot drink fire and breathe water! A scientific answer about hydrogen and oxygen will not answer the purpose. These are facts, not reasons. Why? Why? Why is anything on God's earth what it is? Can Miss Martineau tell? We cannot. God has made it so, and reason, instinct and experience teach us its uses.
