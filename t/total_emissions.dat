40|$|The Schottky {{electron}} emitter {{is the most}} frequently used electron source in electron microscopes. A suppressor electrode around the emitter is usually employed to prevent emission from the shank of the cathode. A concept of operating the Schottky emitter without the suppressor electrode is proposed with the aim of lowering the potential of the extractor electrode. Simulation results show that if the suppressor electrode is removed, then the same field as for the standard configuration can be obtained at the tip apex at an extraction voltage of 2265 V instead of 5000 V. The <b>total</b> <b>emission</b> from the shank region is calculated by estimating the emission area of the shank, taking into the account the different work functions of the crystal facets. The <b>total</b> <b>emission</b> for typical operating parameters is calculated to rise from 500 to 668 ??A. The <b>total</b> <b>emission</b> from the shank and the filament of the Schottky emitter is measured experimentally in two different configurations, which match with the simulated results. The measured <b>total</b> <b>emission</b> of 450 – 750 ??A confirms the idea that a Schottky emitter can be operated without suppressor, all the more so because the power at the extractor aperture is even reduced {{as a result of the}} lower acceleration voltage.

25|$|The climate, geography, and {{environment}} of Finland favours bog and peat bog formation. Thus, peat {{is available in}} considerable quantities.

25|$|Respirable {{suspended}} particulate matter, {{of less than}} 10 micrometers (µm) in size, can {{be present in the}} drift from cooling towers. Larger particles above 10µm in size are generally filtered out in the nose and throat via cilia and mucus but particulate matter smaller than 10µm, referred to as PM10, can settle in the bronchi and lungs and cause health problems. Similarly, particles smaller than 2.5µm, (PM2.5), tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung, and very small particles (less than 100 nanometers) may pass through the lungs to affect other organs. Though the total particulate emissions from wet cooling towers with fresh water make-up is much less, they contain more PM10 and PM2.5 than the <b>total</b> <b>emissions</b> from wet cooling towers with sea water make-up.
