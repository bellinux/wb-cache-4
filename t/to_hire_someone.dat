The following day, Drew's best friend Kate O'Brien (Christa Miller) tells him that she has broken up with her boyfriend, who then fired her from {{her job as a}} receptionist at his body shop. Desperate for a job, Kate asks Drew to hire her at the Winfred-Louder department store where he is the assistant director of personnel. Drew insists that he cannot hire his friends. At Winfred-Louder, Drew's boss Mr. Bell (Kevin Pollak) asks him <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> for a position at the cosmetics counter. While conducting interviews, Drew meets Mimi Bobeck (Kathy Kinney), a hostile woman who wears too much eye shadow. Drew tries to be polite, but Mimi soon realizes {{he is not going to}} give her the job and accuses Drew of being sexist. Mimi complains to Mr. Bell about Drew, getting him into trouble.|$|E

25|$|Prohibited {{discrimination}} may include, {{among other}} things, firing or refusing <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> {{based on a}} real or perceived disability, segregation, and harassment based on a disability. Covered entities are also required to provide reasonable accommodations to job applicants and employees with disabilities. A reasonable accommodation {{is a change in}} the way things are typically done that the person needs because of a disability, and can include, among other things, special equipment that allows the person to perform the job, scheduling changes, and changes to the way work assignments are chosen or communicated. An employer is not required to provide an accommodation that would involve undue hardship (significant difficulty or expense), and the individual who receives the accommodation must still perform the essential functions of the job and meet the normal performance requirements. An employee or applicant who currently engages in the illegal use of drugs is not considered qualified when a covered entity takes adverse action based on such use.|$|E

5|$|Donaggio had no {{interest}} in making soundtracks for films at the time, but was introduced to Nicolas Roeg who decided to try him out and asked him to write something for the beginning of the film. Roeg was enthusiastic about the result but the London-based producers were resistant <b>to</b> <b>hiring</b> <b>someone</b> who had no background in films. The film's financiers were pleased with Donaggio's work and overruled the producers. As well as composing the score, Donaggio performed a substantial portion of it himself. The piano pieces were performed by Donaggio, {{despite the fact that he}} was not very accomplished at playing the piano. The piano pieces are usually associated with Christine in the film, and Roeg wanted them to have an innocent sound reminiscent of a little girl learning to play the piano. Donaggio claims that since he was not very good at playing the piano, the pieces had an unsure style to them, perfect for the effect they were trying to capture.|$|R

500|$|After {{taking a}} cheese making course at Washington State University, Dammeier decided he needed <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> {{to work with}} him as chief cheesemaker. He hired Brad Sinko, a microbiologist, who {{previously}} had managed his family cheese business of Bandon Cheese in Oregon, before it was acquired by the Tillamook County Creamery Association. According to Dammeier, the artisanal cheese market was underrepresented in Seattle and Washington, and he opened his business in part to encourage more cheese business to grow in the region. In 2000, Washington had nine licensed cheesemakers; this expanded to twenty-eight by 2007. Dammeier compared the growth he expects in artisan cheese to the United States' recent growth in sales of specialty beers: ...|$|E
500|$|Ricardo Iorio was the {{frontman}} and bassist of {{the band}} V8, which broke up in 1987. After its disbandment, Iorio formed Hermética, which had a similar [...] musical style to V8. Initially, he tried to work with Martín Knye, {{a former member of}} Kamikaze, but after two meetings, the idea was abandoned. Iorio then appointed the guitarist Antonio Romano from the band Cerbero, who had been previously considered for V8. Iorio wanted Romano to be both a vocalist and bassist, but his manager Marcelo Tommy persuaded Iorio <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> else. Iorio eventually chose Claudio O'Connor for vocals and Fabián Spataro from the band Mark as drummer. They began to practice at Villa Ballester in 1987. The name {{of the band}} is a reference to hermeticism; Iorio saw similarities between the hermetic doctrine and the context of the Argentine heavy metal.|$|E
500|$|Wintour {{has been}} a {{supporter}} of the Democratic Party since Hillary Clinton's 2000 Senate run and John Kerry's 2004 presidential run and serving Barack Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential runs as a [...] "bundler" [...] of contributions. In 2008 and 2012, she co-hosted fundraisers with Sarah Jessica Parker, the latter being a 50-person, $40,000-per-person dinner at Parker's West Village town house with Meryl Streep, Michael Kors, and Trey Laird, an advertising executive, among the attendees. She has also teamed with Calvin Klein and Harvey Weinstein on fundraisers during Obama's first term and Donna Karan {{has been a}}mongst the attendees. In 2013 when Vogues former director of communications stepped down, Wintour was rumoured to be looking <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> with a political background. Soon after, Wintour hired Hildy Kuryk, a former fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee and Obama's first campaign. She supported Hillary Clinton's 2016 Presidential Campaign, forming part of Clinton's long list of wealthy donors or [...] "Hillblazers" [...] as well as serving as Clinton's consultant [...] on her wardrobe choices for key moments of the campaign.|$|E
50|$|People {{who are in}} {{opposition}} to integrity testing state that it is unfair <b>to</b> not <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> {{because they have a}} predisposition to do something that they might never do. Critics also say integrity tests can violate legal and ethical privacy standards, because there could be some questions that are not related to specific duties of the job, and there is not protection for the illegal use of the data. Another criticism is the possibility that an integrity test would have adverse impact in screening out a higher proportion of minority group members. Critics also say if a client learns of their own score, it may have an adverse effect on their morale, but even if the scores were only shown to the employers, it could affect the employers attitude towards the employee which could hurt the effectiveness of the employee.|$|R

50|$|The American Disability act, {{also known}} as the ADA has made a huge impact on the deaf community. In 1990 it was a {{landmark}} for people for with disabilities. The ADA has been a great benefit for hard of hearing and deaf people to help they gain every aspect of life that a hearing person has. The ADA took the important principles in these laws and extended them to the broad mainstream of Americans public life. It prohibits discrimination in almost every aspect of society.(26) Meaning you would have a legitimate reason <b>to</b> not <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> with a disability. The legislation provides legal protection in employment(Title I), access to state and local government and public transportation (title II), public accommodations (Title III)(they have to provide a translator), and telecommunications (title IV). (26) George H W Bush signed this into act, and there was no acclaimed retaliation from this. It didn’t solve the problem of discrimination but it gave those who had a disability protection.|$|R
500|$|Stevens is {{a proponent}} of using {{statistical}} analysis to enhance his coaching decisions, spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film. [...] "I think it's a unique {{way of looking at}} the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players", he explains. For example, when Butler was slumping in late 2010, Stevens challenged his team: [...] "this [...] is where we are. This isn't acceptable to get to where we want to go. But what does that really mean? It's not just get better defensively, it is, if we give up 3 less baskets a game, then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country". The team got the message, improved throughout the season, and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense. In 2012, Stevens became the first college coach <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff. If he had the resources, Stevens says he would hire a team of statisticians to analyze the teams play.|$|E
500|$|Production on the anime began {{sometime}} {{after the release}} of the fifth novel in October 2014. [...] Masaharu Watanabe was chosen by Yoshikawa to direct the series because he had previously worked for the studio doing key animation, while Kyuta Sakai was picked to be the series' character designer and animation director because Yoshikawa felt that {{she would be able to}} do justice to the novel's art and also maintain the series animation quality over 25 episodes. [...] Masahiro Yokotani was brought on board to compose the anime, his first time working on a [...] "reborn in another world"-type story. [...] Yoshikawa warned him about the violence in the series, but he was still surprised by the violent and disturbing scenes in novels three and beyond, having only read the first novel when he agreed to work on the project; he delegated the writing of those episodes in the second [...] to the other two scriptwriters. [...] Yoshiko Nakamura joined the project {{sometime after}} Masahiro had completed the script for episode 3. [...] When it proved unfeasible for Yokotani and Nakamura to write the scripts alone, the decision was made to bring another scriptwriter on board. [...] Gaku Iwasa, the president of White Fox, asked them <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> [...] "younger", leading Yokotani to suggest Eiji Umehara. [...] Nagatsuki had recently been playing Chaos;Child, which Umehara had written for, and he approved the choice, suggesting that they let Umehara write the [...] "painful parts"; Umehara was invited to join the project around the time that the scripts for episodes 8 and 9 were being written.

Progress is achieved by nurturing existing people, retaining the most productive, and hiring newcomers who add value. New recruits, with new ideas, are often an affront to the existing “state of affairs” — a negative side of human nature.

2500|$|Paulus {{claimed to}} {{know nothing of}} McKittrick's past, but Bennett thought her {{comparison}} of the two women's lifestyles was unusual if she was telling the truth. He knew that several years earlier she had been arrested on vagrancy and prostitution charges, and he sought a way to impeach her testimony. An officer who had arrested her, Lieutenant Allbright, then testified, casting doubt on her credibility, after which Bennett eventually persuaded Paulus's daughter, Mary Jo Wood, to give evidence against her. The relationship between mother and daughter had soured some years previously, after Paulus had disapproved of a man Wood was dating, attempted to have them both killed, then had her daughter confined to a mental hospital. Wood had escaped from the institution and fled with the man to another state, where the couple married, and {{she was afraid to}} return to Texas. She agreed to testify only after Bennett assured her that the District Attorney's office would ensure her protection while she was in Houston. Bennett introduced Mary Jo Wood as a surprise witness. She went on to testify that when Wood was a young girl, Paulus had owned several properties on Galveston's Post Office Street, a notorious red-light district, that were operated as brothels. She also said that Paulus had accepted payment from a man who wished to perform a sexual act with Wood. Wood testified that she and her mother met Joan Robinson Hill through Diane Settegast around 1963. While at Robinson Hill's home, the women also met Ash Robinson. Wood said that she and her mother occasionally sat in the Robinson box at horse shows. [...] When Wood visited her mother in December 1970, she claimed she was told by Paulus of a call from Settegast, saying that Robinson wanted <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> to kill John Hill.|$|E

5000|$|The {{significance}} of the case regards whether the Fugitive Slave Act (1793) was constitutional or not. The Fugitive Slave Act allowed plantation masters <b>to</b> recapture or <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> else <b>to</b> recapture one of their runaway slaves. Chief Justice Parker argued slaves were not [...] "parties in the constitution," [...] therefore, the act was deemed not unconstitutional because slaves were property not a person. Thus when translating and analyzing the 4th Amendment (1791) [...] they determined who it {{did or did not}} apply to. Therefore, it was determined that slaves were not covered by the U.S. Constitution, making the Fugitive Slave Act constitutional. [...] When the 13th Amendment was ratified in 1865 a wave of change blew in, it annulled the Fugitive Slave Act and the legislation that came with it. [...] This was a significant shift because slaves were now beginning to be considered as persons not property, persons who had rights and who were covered under the 4th amendment.|$|R
