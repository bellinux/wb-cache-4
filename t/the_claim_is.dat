5|$|The monastery is {{mentioned}} {{for the first}} time in the early 14th century, although Yevgeniy Bolkhovitinov claimed that it had been founded by the first Metropolitan of Kiev, Michael, along with Greek monks arriving from Byzantium in 988 AD. <b>The</b> <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> likely spurious, since Mezhyhirya is not listed by modern authors among the monasteries of Kievan Rus.|$|E
5|$|Albert Victor's intellect, {{sexuality}} {{and mental health}} {{have been the subject}} of speculation. Rumours linked him with the Cleveland Street scandal, which involved a homosexual brothel, but there is no conclusive evidence that he ever went there or was even homosexual. Some authors have argued that he was the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, but contemporary documents show that Albert Victor could not have been in London at the time of the murders, and <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> widely dismissed.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{original}} slogans of the Whopper advertised by Burger King was There are 1024 ways to have a Whopper; <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> based on an exponential function of whether the sandwich has the ingredient or not, represented by a binary number of 0 or 1, raised {{to the power of}} number of possible ingredients at the time, ten, thus 210 =1,024. This claim was later expanded to There are 221,184 possible ways for a customer to order a Whopper sandwich. Other slogans include It takes two hands to handle a Whopper and Burger King: Home of the Whopper.|$|E
5000|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> not {{directed}} to an abstract idea under step {{one of the}} Alice analysis, {{we do not need}} to proceed to step two of that analysis[...] [...] [...] We think it is clear for the reasons stated that <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> {{not directed}} to an abstract idea, and so we stop at step one. We conclude that <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> patent-eligible.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> {{initially}} {{submitted to}} the International Journal of Astrobiology, which rejected the paper, but were eventually published by the fringe Journal of Cosmology.

5|$|Recent {{research}} by historian Norman Fortier suggests that Mayer {{was shot down}} by Lieutenant Walter Gresham of the 358th Fighter Squadron of the 355th Fighter Wing. <b>The</b> <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> based on gun camera footage and recollections of Mayer's wingman, who was forced to bail out during the action. Mayer was buried at the cemetery of Beaumont-le-Roger, France, and in 1955 re-interred at the German War Cemetery in St. Desiré de Lisieux.|$|E
5|$|Rockall {{is a small}} rocky islet in the North Atlantic {{which was}} {{declared}} part of Scotland by the Island of Rockall Act 1972. However, despite no posession by any other state and other precedents, the legality of <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> disputed by the Republic of Ireland, Denmark and Iceland and some say, it is may be unenforceable in international law.|$|E
5|$|The Frankish overlordship ended {{during the}} reign of Mislav two decades later. According to the Constantine VII Christianization of Croats began in the 7th century, but <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> disputed and {{generally}} Christianization is associated with the 9th century. The first native Croatian ruler recognised by the Pope was Duke Branimir, who received papal recognition from Pope John VIII on 7 June 879.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> {{adjudication}} process <b>is</b> complete, {{the insurance}} company often sends {{a letter to the}} person filing <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> describing <b>the</b> outcome. The letter, which is sometimes referred to as remittance advice, includes a statement as to whether <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> denied or approved. If the company denied <b>the</b> <b>claim,</b> it has to provide an explanation for the reason why under regional laws. The company also often sends an explanation of benefits that includes detailed information about how each service included in <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> settled. Insurance companies will then send out payments to the providers if <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> approved or to the provider’s billing service.|$|R
5000|$|The Court's {{permission}} to enforce in full <b>is</b> required if <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> found at trial to be [...] "fundamentally dishonest".

50|$|In 1977, the Kanehsatà:ke band {{filed an}} {{official}} land <b>claim</b> with <b>the</b> federal Office of Native <b>Claims</b> regarding <b>the</b> land. <b>The</b> <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> accepted for filing and funds were provided for additional research of <b>the</b> <b>claim.</b> In 1986 <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> rejected on <b>the</b> basis that {{it failed to}} meet key legal criteria.|$|R
5|$|There are 37,000 known {{species in}} Croatia, but their actual number is {{estimated}} to be between 50,000 and 100,000. <b>The</b> <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> supported by nearly 400 new taxa of invertebrates discovered in Croatia {{in the first half of}} the 2000s (decade) alone. There are more than a thousand endemic species, especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species.|$|E
5|$|This {{adornment}} in Indian Mound Cemetery {{has been}} called the first such public decoration of Confederate burials, but <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> disputed by other towns in the Southern United States. Romney's decoration contributed to a precedent that spread throughout the South during the Reconstruction Era. Relatives and loved ones of the Union dead buried in Indian Mound Cemetery also began to follow this precedent by decorating the cemetery's Union headstones.|$|E
5|$|Whether Sharp {{had made}} <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> uncertain, but Beauchamp {{believed}} he had. He planned to murder him and flee with Anna to Missouri. He would murder Sharp {{in the early}} morning of November 7, 1825, when the new legislature convened its session, as he hoped that suspicion would fall on Sharp's political enemies. Three weeks prior to that date, Beauchamp sold his property, telling his friends that he was planning to move to Missouri. He hired laborers to help load his wagons two days before the planned murder.|$|E

5|$|Bar Hemingway was the {{favourite}} bar of Ernest Hemingway and is said {{by some to}} be {{the birthplace}} of the Bloody Mary cocktail which was invented for him. However, <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> disputed as Fernand Petiot claimed to have invented the drink in 1921 while working at Harry's New York Bar, a frequent Paris hangout for Hemingway and other American expatriates, rather than in the bar in the Ritz itself. The bar has been restored to its original appearance, with rich wood panelling and leather upholstery and has 25 original photographs on the walls taken by the author of places and people that inspired him.|$|E
5|$|In 1161, Edward the Confessor {{was made}} a saint, and objects {{connected}} with his reign became holy relics. The monks at his burial place of Westminster Abbey claimed that Edward had asked them to look after his regalia in perpetuity {{and that they were}} to be used at the coronations of all future kings. A note to this effect is contained in an inventory of relics drawn up by Richard Sporley, a monk at the abbey in 1450, recording a tunicle, dalmatic, pallium, and other vestments; a gold sceptre, two rods, a gold crown, comb, and spoon; for the queen's coronation a crown and two rods; and for the holy communion a chalice of onyx stone and a paten made of gold– all of which were to be considered precious relics. Although <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> likely to have been an exercise in self-promotion on the abbey's part, and some of the regalia had probably been taken from Edward's grave when he was reinterred there, it became accepted as fact, thereby establishing the first known set of hereditary coronation regalia in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Lord Wilberforce, in Quistclose, {{stated that}} the {{contract}} gives the moneylender an equitable interest in the loan. Under Wilberforce's two-stage trust, the interest in the money first goes from the lender to the borrower (the primary trust) and then, when the trust's purpose fails, reverses (the secondary trust). In Twinsectra Lord Millett also explained that a Quistclose trust is a resulting trust, but held that the lender retains the interest throughout the transaction, with no need for this interest to reverse if {{the purpose of the}} loan fails. The problem with Wilberforce's analysis, as explained by Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, is that because the resulting trust only comes into existence after the misuse of the loan, it may come too late; if the money is not available when <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> brought, there is no remedy. The borrower may already have spent the money, or already be insolvent and the subject of claims by creditors.|$|E

5|$|The {{final vote}} {{has come under}} much {{criticism}} because of the relatively {{small percentage of the}} 9000-strong IAU membership who participated. Besides the fact that most members do not attend the General Assemblies, this lack was also due to the timing of the vote: the final vote was taken {{on the last day of}} the 10-day event, after many participants had left or were preparing to leave. <b>The</b> <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> that only 424 astronomers were present for the vote, which is less than 5% of the entire community of astronomers. However, sampling 400 representative members out of a population of 9,000 statistically yields a result with good accuracy (confidence interval better than 5%). There is also the issue of the many astronomers who were unable or who chose not to make the trip to Prague and, thus, cast no vote. Astronomer Marla Geha has clarified that not all members of the Union were needed to vote on the classification issue: only those whose work is directly related to planetary studies.|$|E
