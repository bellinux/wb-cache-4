5|$|By 221 Elagabalus' eccentricities, {{particularly}} {{his relationship with}} Hierocles, increasingly provoked the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard. When Elagabalus' grandmother Julia Maesa perceived <b>that</b> <b>popular</b> support for the emperor was waning, she decided {{that he and his}} mother, who had encouraged his religious practices, had to be replaced. As alternatives, she turned to her other daughter, Julia Avita Mamaea, and her daughter's son, the thirteen-year-old Severus Alexander.|$|E
5|$|Life is Worth Living was not {{the only}} DuMont program to achieve double-digit ratings. In 1952, Time {{magazine}} reported <b>that</b> <b>popular</b> DuMont game show Down You Go had attracted an audience estimated at 16 million viewers. Similarly, DuMont's summer 1954 replacement series, The Goldbergs, achieved audiences estimated at 10 million. Still, these series were only moderately popular compared to NBC's and CBS's highest-rated programs.|$|E
5|$|Tillman {{had long}} seen a Senate seat as a logical next step once he {{concluded}} {{his time as}} governor. Senator Butler, whose term expired in March 1895, had soon after the 1890 election begun to shift his positions towards Tillman's, hoping to retain Conservative backing while appealing to the governor's supporters. The senator signed on to most demands of the Farmers' Alliance, and {{did not support the}} forces trying to prevent Tillman's re-nomination in 1892. Butler's seeming apostasy disheartened Conservatives, who did not bother to run candidates for the legislature in many counties in 1894, abandoning the field (and Butler's Senate seat) to the Tillmanites. The governor took nothing for granted, seeing to it <b>that</b> <b>popular</b> candidates, loyal to him, ran for the legislature. In addition to electing Tillman to the Senate, these legislators could help preserve his gubernatorial legacy, including the dispensary.|$|E

25|$|Mainstream naturism may pathologize (i.e. {{treat as}} psychologically {{abnormal}} or unhealthy) those who enjoy the eroticism of nudity.

25|$|During this time, {{a gradual}} shift occurs in Adrian's focus from the bass sax to the vibraphone.

Rollini recorded on bass sax for the last time in 1938. He continued to be active with vibraphone and chimes, but sadly, when he gave up his role as a bass saxophonist, his role in jazz went with it.|$|E
