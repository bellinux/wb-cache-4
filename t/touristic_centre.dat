40|$|Two {{temporary}} seismological {{networks have}} been set up in 2000 and 2002 in {{the central part of the}} Pyrenees, in a region, which appears as a transition between two domains where both the seismic activity and the tectonic regime are different. Together with the permanent networks, they allowed us to obtain precise hypocenter locations for more than 400 events with local magnitudes ranging from 1. 5 to 4. 6, as well as 30 new focal mechanisms. The seismicity is distributed in several clusters, which are not located along the North Pyrenean Fault, considered as the major tectonic accident resulting from the suture of the Iberian and Eurasian convergent plates when the range formed. Several small fault segments dipping to the north are identified. The maximum focal depth varies from 10 to 20 km, with variations which are roughly parallel to those of the Moho, indicating a thickening of the seismogenic layer to the east of the studied area. The obtained focal solutions reveal a predominance of normal faulting to the West and reverse faulting to the East, with strike-slip motions in between. The largest fault segment to the East, with a length of about 20 km, could possibly be related to a large historical event which occurred in 1660, with intensity IX, close to cities which have become since then important <b>touristic</b> <b>centres...</b>|$|R
40|$|Shrines {{and sacred}} places occupy a very {{significant}} position within the religious imagery and practices of Polish Catholics. The officially recognized Catholic shrines in Poland number more than 800. Among them {{the most popular and}} perceived as a “national shrine” is the Jasna Góra monastery in Częstochowa. In my chapter I will focus on the symbolic space of Jasna Góra during the 1980 s, and during post-communist and contemporary times showing how its space has been shaped, remade and lived by Polish Catholics within a period of transformation. On the one hand I will analyze the growing “nationalization” of a religious space of this Marian shrine. On the other hand I will show the “trans-national,” “European” and ecumenical elements which have been added to Jasna Góra within the last years due to a growing number of international visitors welcomed in this traditionally “Polish-national” shrine. As a counterpart to historically established Jasna Góra shrine I will analyze space and practices related to a relatively new Marian shrine located in a small village of Licheń in central Poland. Within the last 30 years the Licheń shrine and its popularity grew {{to such an extent that}} many Polish Catholics started to see it as a second “national shrine” comparable to, or even more important than, Jasna Góra. The Licheń shrine grew rapidly from a small area around the local parish church to a huge 76 -hectare “religious-national theme park” surrounding the biggest basilica in Poland, erected in the year 2004. The vast park consists of various sacred places hidden in beautifully trimmed gardens. Statues, landscapes (e. g. an artificial 25 -metre high “Golgotha Hill”), memorial monuments, and chapels cover not only the story of a sacred place, but also recall various Polish-national themes connected with a mythologized “national history” as well as contemporary political and social debates. In this comparative analysis of two of the most popular Polish Catholic sacred spaces I will emphasize that making and remaking of sacred spaces within the period of transformation mirror various competing and complementing trends of 'lived religion' in contemporary Polish society and reveal changes in the practices and expectations of visitors to shrines, which are nowadays perceived as religious, national but also <b>touristic</b> <b>centres...</b>|$|R

40|$|Restructuring {{historic}} centres in Gulf cities {{has been}} a trend in recent years. Yet, {{a large share of}} these centres is still populated by lower income migrant communities, particularly male labourers from South Asia. Qatar’s capital Doha and Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates are important examples, where the local identity of their city centres including the particular urban life and spatial settings have been highly affected by the everyday practices of migrant groups over several decades. The continuous exchange of migrants led to a continuous import of new ways how public spaces are perceived and used. Multicultural realities are therefore increasingly prevailing and have led to local decision makers experiencing a conflicted local identity. Due to the fact that national citizens have moved to suburbs and have usually been avoiding these central public spaces, urban life is to a large extent defined by migrants. This contribution presents findings on lived public spaces of central city districts and on the characteristics of urban spaces {{and the way in which}} migrant communities appropriate them. The methodological approach of this study includes structured ﬁeld surveys, systematic observations as well as behavioural mapping techniques. Due to current tendencies to replace deteriorating areas within central districts, many Gulf cities are facing the potential loss of very distinctive neighbourhoods, which have however not been recognised as important factors for a local urban identity. Instead, migrant networks and practices are often seen as less important in developing place-making strategies due to their limited economic impact. Thus, historic parts of Gulf cities are mainly explored for their potential role as <b>touristic</b> and commercial <b>centres</b> instead of integrating various measures to connect public spaces and to enable an overall local economic development. Subsequently, major developments have been launched to entirely replace old building stock and to reconfigure urban fabrics. The Souq Waqif or the Msheireb projects in Doha are only two examples of a tendency to commercialise spaces rather than to preserve spatial and economic ties between existing communities. This paper focuses on two specific districts, known as Al Asmakh in Doha and Al Muraba’a in Al Ain, in order to illustrate both the general characteristics of dynamics between traditional public spaces and low-income migrant communities, which have to be acknowledged for any attempt to integrate spatial and social diversity. The outcomes reveal stimulating dynamics between migrant communities and their environments. It also postulates that city residents have the capacity to recover swiftly from difficulties and resilience in spite of an impeding spatial context. The paper concludes with projections of how contemporary transformation processes in Gulf cities will benefit from social inclusion. Such a transformation should stem from the recognition that migrant communities need to have access to develop their own settings that relate to their routine spatial practices while securing the economic basis of those communities...|$|R
40|$|In many {{developing}} countries, {{those people who}} work the land as food producers are also the ones who most suffer from food insecurity. While many studies look at the power dynamics within the food system {{at the global level}} and the role played by transnational companies in particular, this investigation starts at the local level to look into the reasons behind the high levels of food insecurity among farmers. Specifically, it analyses how the relationship between the domestic food producers and the state in Tanzania has affected food security in rural areas, in particular in farmers' households. The question it asks is: How has the relationship between the state and farmers shaped food security in rural Tanzania since its independence? A qualitative approach has been employed: farmer interviews were conducted in 8 villages located in two regions of Tanzania - Coast and Kilimanjaro - and supplemented by interviews with state officials and civil society representatives. The villages surveyed in the Coast region suffer from arid conditions and are isolated from the main road that connects Dar es Salaam to Morogoro, while the villages studied in the Kilimanjaro region are on the slopes of the mountains around the town of Usangi, far from the <b>touristic</b> and commercial <b>centres</b> of Moshi and Arusha. Through interviews with farmers in these villages, the qualitative approach of this research offers a contextualised insight into food insecurity, the problems of the agricultural sector and farmers' attitude towards the state and its policies. The interviews with state officials and representatives of civil society were employed to investigate both current agricultural policies and officials’ attitude towards small scale farmers. This thesis makes an empirical contribution to the literature on food security and state-farmer relationships. I argue that the mixture of agricultural policies implemented by the state over the years have done little to improve the livelihoods of small scale farmers that live in isolated rural areas. One of the reasons why this is so is that the policies are not framed around the needs of small scale farmers (despite them being the great majority of the farmers in the country), and hence are not welcomed positively by the communities. The results of this study identify a reciprocal distrust between the state and farmers as one of the main causes of policy failure and unsatisfactory improvements in food security in rural areas. On one side, state officials see small scale farmers as inefficient and wish for the agricultural sector to be driven by medium and large scale farmers. On the other side, most farmers tend to dismiss state officials' advice as inadequate to the reality of farming. In general, farmers see the state as a distant entity, with which they have little contact and which they do not trust. I argue that the controversial relationship between the Tanzanian state and farmers is historically grounded and has a direct link with food insecurity amongst farmers for two main reasons. First, it affects the framing, objectives and implementation of agricultural policies, which thus fail to support small scale farmers. Second, it hinders the ability of farmers to successfully cooperate and/or create a coherent farmers' movement to improve food security and address their challenges at state level. Farmers' discontent is perceived in their alienation to politics, and in their distrust towards a state that has historically not been able to address their challenges nor improve their condition...|$|R

40|$|A {{sustained}} {{progress of}} the town of Constanta, a predominantly commercial and <b>touristic</b> <b>centre,</b> needed the support of a modern transport infrastructure, i. e. secure and quick communication networks.

As such, the city was among the first towns in the country to build a connecting railway with the Danube River, once the bridges over the river were put up, and, consequently, to have a direct link with Western Europe, and the Orient Express. On the other hand, the city owes much of its progress to the local authorities, for whom the transport from town to places such as the harbour, the hippodrome, the beaches at Vii and Mamaia, were not to be neglected. Overall, this progress transformed Constanta into one of the most modern and dynamic economic areas in the Romanian Old Kingdom, in the early 20 th century...|$|E
40|$|My design {{task was}} the {{improvement}} of a Roma settlement in a post industrial city of Hungary, Ózd. After the change of regime the factory, being the main work source, had closed and since then the population has been decreasing. On the other hand this year the government set up a plan {{to invest in the}} city through renovating {{a significant part of the}} factory-plot turning it into a <b>touristic</b> <b>centre.</b> This development offers a new chance for Ózd, however at the same time it is threat to the poorest Roma settlement of the city; Hétes which is located nearby the factory. It is clear that the proximity of such an impoverished area is not ideal for the new centre. Therefore it is most likely in the current political atmosphere that the main approach will be to evict the inhabitants in the near future, forcing them into an even worse situation. My solution on the other hand is to invest in the area in a way that the inhabitants could still stay; through involving them in a process of improving their surroundings.

The aim is to illuminate how the material culture of contemporary architecture together with surveillance practices and technologies contribute to a remodelling our notions of the visible and the invisible. Whereas the architecture is determined by conditions and possibilities {{of what it means to}} be living behind glass facades, the novel Die 120 Tage von Berlin by the German author Lukas Hammerstein explores the complexities that this mode of living cause on a socio–psychological level. Through this dual track analytical strategy a complex set of connotations governing our understanding of visibility and invisibility will be uncovered. Imagine yourself in any larger European city. You are in the <b>touristic</b> <b>centre</b> with quaint old buildings, shops and cafes on street level, the odd museum tucked into the dense urban fabric. You gradually move away from the throngs of tourists and shoppers and reach, often without having to walk all that far, one of the city’s most recently developed districts, an area filled with new buildings, typically a mix of high–end dwellings and offices. These areas are, more often than not, built on sites that have been left over from the industrial period. They leave you with a very uniform impression caused by the predominance of one architectural aesthetic: tall, potent, freestanding buildings and an almost omnipresent use of glass an...|$|E
