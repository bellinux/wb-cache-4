5|$|The campaigning {{season was}} by now well-advanced, as Julian {{had spent a}} {{considerable}} time restoring Saverne. But it was still summer, as <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> hot and wheat was ripe in the fields. It was therefore probably August.|$|E
5|$|In the Third Round, Queens Park Rangers of the Third Division South {{were beaten}} 1–0 at Loftus Road.

5|$|The {{mission was}} {{reported}} as ready to go—"except for the weather"—on October 1. The major concern with <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> a major tropical storm in the Atlantic, {{though there were}} also worries over a series of typhoons in the Pacific which could pose a problem for recovery operations. On the evening of October 2, the decision was taken to launch the next morning.|$|E
5|$|The race {{started at}} 14:00China Standard Time (UTC+8), and was {{scheduled}} to last until 17:30. <b>The</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> unseasonably cool.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> fine as Australia {{started their}} second innings just after noon {{on the third}} day. Australia batted {{strongly}} and on the fourth day, Johnson came in at 6/445, with Australia already ahead by 580. He made nine before his partner Ray Lindwall was stumped, which prompted Bradman to declare at 7/460. This left England a victory target of 596, which would require a world record run chase.|$|E

5|$|After leaving False Bay on 1 July, Bounty set {{out across}} the {{southern}} Indian Ocean on the long voyage to their next port of call, Adventure Bay in Tasmania. They passed the remote Île Saint-Paul, a small uninhabited island which Bligh knew from earlier navigators contained fresh water and a hot spring, {{but he did not}} attempt a landing. <b>The</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> cold and wintry, conditions akin to the vicinity of Cape Horn, and it was difficult to take navigational observations, but Bligh's skill was such that on 19 August he sighted Mewstone Rock, on the south-west corner of Tasmania and, two days later, made anchorage in Adventure Bay.|$|E

5|$|Although al-Jamri's {{death was}} {{announced}} in the morning, the mourning processions only began after the sunset Maghrib prayer. The funeral course was changed several times. Ultimately, it began at 6:00 in Muqsha village before moving along {{the west side of}} Budaiya highway to Bani Jamra, where al-Jamri was buried at 10:00. <b>The</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> extremely cold for Bahrain, yet thousands showed up wearing black mourning clothes and carrying black flags. According to a number of Al-Wasat writers, the funeral was the largest in the modern history of Bahrain.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater. The cyclical monsoon patterns meant that <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> deplorable for flight operations {{eight months of}} the year (from late September to early May) when rain and fog tended to conceal targets. Lack of adequate all-weather and night-bombing capability made it necessary for the majority of U.S. missions to be conducted during daylight hours, thereby easing the burden on the air defense forces of North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|At kickoff, a {{light breeze}} was blowing from the {{northeast}} at , the air temperature was , and <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> foggy with a light rain. Rain had been falling for several hours, turning the field into a muddy mess that would hinder play throughout the game. 62,850 tickets were sold for the game, and that number was given as the official attendance. Real attendance estimates range from 40,000-50,000, due to the poor weather {{and the fact that}} the stadium was half-empty through much of the game.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, {{the boys}} would play sports, boxing, or other leisure activities, or have hockey or rugby league {{training}} if <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> suitable. Weekends revolved mainly around sports. Field hockey, rugby league, and other sports were commonly played during the winter time. The boys of the orphanage had a well-known reputation in Goulburn for their sports abilities; boys who participated in tournaments and games usually did well, winning many trophies. The orphanage also had a football team. Sometimes, the boys would hold fetes or participate in annual concerts and operettas, where they would sing and dance.|$|E
5|$|By 13 January {{most of the}} {{survivors}} of the fleet had limped back to France in a state of disrepair. One ship of the line that remained at sea, the 74-gun Droits de l'Homme, was commanded by Commodore Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse and carried over 1,300men, 700–800 of them soldiers, including General Jean Humbert. Detached from {{the main body of the}} fleet during the retreat from Bantry Bay, Lacrosse made his way to the mouth of the Shannon alone. Recognising that <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> still too violent for a landing to be made, Lacrosse acknowledged the failure of the operation and ordered the ship to return to France, capturing the British privateer Cumberland en route.|$|E
5|$|By mid-March, the Prussian {{ships were}} ready for action and the ice had receded far enough that Prince Adalbert ordered Jachmann to conduct a {{reconnaissance}} of the blockading force on 16 March. In the meantime, Dockum's squadron had arrived off Swinemünde two days before. Arcona and Nymphe patrolled off Greifswald, but <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> very poor, with snow showers hampering visibility. The Prussian gunboats, led by the paddle steamer , remained closer to Swinemünde. Jachmann spotted three vessels at around 15:30, but {{there was not enough}} time before dark to catch them. Instead, Jachmann turned back to Swinemünde, intending to try again the following day.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the {{division}} was in place, the battle lines on both sides had largely solidified, leaving the 45th Infantry Division in a stationary position as it conducted attacks and counterattacks for the same ground. The division was put {{under the command of}} Eighth Army's I Corps for most of the conflict. It was deployed around Chorwon and assigned to protect the key routes from that area into Seoul. The terrain was difficult and <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> poor in the region. The division suffered its first casualty on 11 December 1951.|$|E
5|$|Following Spies' speech, {{the crowd}} was {{addressed}} by Parsons, the Alabama-born editor of the radical English-language weekly The Alarm. The crowd was so calm that Mayor Carter Harrison Sr., who had stopped by to watch, walked home early.
