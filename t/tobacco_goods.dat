In addition, they dominate [...] "the shipping, textiles, construction, real estate, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, and personal computer industries as well as the country's wholesale distribution networks and six out of the ten English-language newspapers in Manila, including the one with the largest circulation." [...] Of 66% remaining part of the economy in the Philippines by either ethnic Chinese or Filipinos, the Chinese control 35% of all total sales. Among the nation's 35 banks, ethnic Chinese on average control 35% of total banking equity. In the Secondary Industry, seventy-five percent of the country's 2,500 rice mills were Chinese-owned. Chinese Filipino entrepreneurs were also dominant in wood processing, and accounted for over 10% of the capital invested in the lumber industry as also accounted for 40% of the industry's annual output and controlled nearly all the sawmills in the nation. Emerging import-substituting light industries would see the rise of active participation of Chinese entrepreneurs and owned several-salt works and a large number of small and medium-sized factories engaged in food processing as well as the production of leather and <b>tobacco</b> <b>goods.</b> By the early 1960s, Chinese presence in the manufacturing sector became significant.

Of the 163 domestic companies, 80 were Chinese-owned and included the manufacturing of coconut oil, some food products, tobacco, textiles, plastic products, footwear, glass, and certain types of metals such as tubes and pipes, wire rods, nails, bolts, and containers while the Filipinos dominated sugar, rolling mills, industrial chemicals, fertilizers, cement, galvanizing plants, and tin plates. The Chinese were also prevalent in the shipping industry and in sea transport as sea transport {{was one of the few}} methods of transporting goods cheaply and quickly across a country, which the Philippines being an archipelago, comprises more than 1000 islands and inlets. Chinese Filipinos also control ten percent of the capital invested in the timber industry.|$|E
