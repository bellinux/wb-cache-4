5000|$|Track and Field - Coach Brian Fitzgerald has an {{outstanding}} record coaching sprinters. Angela Burnham, Marion Jones, Valexsia Droughn and Zaria Francis each won the prestigious 100 meters at the CIF California State Meet, with Burnham adding the 100 and 200 meters titles while leading {{the team to}} the girls' team in 1991. [...] Jones also won multiple titles, including both sprints 4 years in a row, completed after transferring {{out of the program}} for her junior year. Jones went on to future worldwide fame and disrepute. Both Burnham and Jones were named the national Girls' [...] "High School Athlete of the Year" [...] by Track and Field News twice. [...] Both were also named Gatorade Player of the Year. [...] In 2000, Porchea Carroll, came within a few thousandths of a second of also winning the state 100 meters title. [...] In 2012, Rio Mesa came within 3 thousandths of a second of sweeping both boys' relay events at the CIF California State Meet, winning the 4x400 metres relay and losing the 4x100 metres relay in the last step of the race. Blake Selig, Darion Zimmerman and Cameron Roach ran on both teams, Anthony <b>Teart</b> ran the 4x400, while Roderick White led off the 4x100. In addition to Francis winning the 100 and 200, Greg Vann Jr. won the 2015 CIF State Championship for long jump with a leap of 24'6".|$|E

A robust AML system must be able to automatically detect any unusual/anomalous financial transactions committed by a customer. The paper presents a hybrid anomaly detection approach that employs clustering to establish customersâ€™ normal behaviors and uses statistical techniques to determine deviation of a particular transaction from the corresponding group behavior. The approach implements a variant of Euclidean Adaptive Resonance Theory, termed as <b>TEART,</b> to group customers in different clusters. The paper also suggests an anomaly index, named AICAF, for ranking transactions as anomalous. The approach has been tested on a real data set comprising of 8. 2 million transactions and the results suggest that <b>TEART</b> scales well in terms of the partitions obtained when compared to the traditional K-means algorithm. The presented approach marks transactions having high AICAF values as suspicious...|$|E

The results are briefly summarized as follows; 1) The nuclear sites present dispersedly {{in the cell}} gradually condense into globe-like young pre-spore in the middle or at the one end of bacterial cell; it increases its' electron dencity with the lapse {{of time and the}} the outer coat and the exosporium is formed; the pre-spore condenses and increases its electron dencity forming complete intracellular spore with the sporangium wall, the exosporium, the outer and inner coats outside of it, and with the cortex, the core and the nuclear site inside of it. The sporangium well <b>teart,</b> freeing the spore with exosporium, outer and inner coats. In some ones, both of the sporangium wall and the exosporium tear and the spore with the outer and inner coats is freed. The spore with three coats, the exosporium, the outer and inner coats, sometimes tears its exosporium and frees the spore with the rest two coats. However, the spores with three spore coats are much more than the ones with two coats. 2) In B. anthracis, the dispersed nuclear sites condense into oval or round structure which can be considered the young spore. In some ones, spore coat-like structure can be observed. However, the young intracellular spore never increased its electron dencity, and no cell-free spore could be observed...|$|E
