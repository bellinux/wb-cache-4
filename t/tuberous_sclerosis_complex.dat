5|$|Advocates for {{the diet}} {{recommend}} {{that it be}} seriously considered after two medications have failed, as the chance of other drugs succeeding is only 10%. The diet can be considered earlier for some epilepsy and genetic syndromes where it has shown particular usefulness. These include Dravet syndrome, infantile spasms, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy and <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> <b>complex.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hereditary {{recurrent}} pneumothorax or pulmonary cysts {{are associated}} with Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, <b>Tuberous</b> <b>Sclerosis</b> <b>Complex</b> (TSC), alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis. Non-hereditary recurrent pneumothorax and/or pulmonary cysts can occur with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. These conditions are differentiated from Birt–Hogg–Dubé through examining the patient history and performing a physical examination. In women suspected to have the disease, ruling out pulmonary or thoracic endometriosis may be necessary.|$|E
5|$|Though fibrofolliculomas {{are unique}} to Birt–Hogg–Dubé, they may present with an {{ambiguous}} appearance and must be confirmed histologically. Other diseases can mimic the dermatologic manifestations of BHD, including <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> <b>complex,</b> Cowden syndrome, familial trichoepitheliomas, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Tuberous sclerosis must be distinguished because both disorders can present with angiofibromas on the face, though they are more common in tuberous sclerosis.|$|E

30|$|Perivascular {{epithelial}} cell tumors (PEComas) are {{a family of}} mesenchymal tumors composed of perivascular epithelioid cells having epithelioid or spindle shape, clear to granular cytoplasm, centrally located, round to oval nucleus and inconspicuous nucleoli. Immunohistochemically, these neoplastic cells exhibit melanocytic marker, HMB- 45, and occasionally myogenic marker, α-SMA. Angiomyolipoma, lymphangioleiomyoma, and clear cell “sugar” tumor {{are included in the}} PEComa family. PEComas arise in various organs throughout the body, especially in soft tissue, bone, abdominopelvic sites, or retroperitoneal site such as the kidney, uterus, and gastrointestinal tract, but PEComa arising in pancreas is extremely rare. We described a primary PEComa occurring in the pancreatic body of a 61 -year-old woman without a history of <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> <b>complexes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) and {{pulmonary}} lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) are {{the most}} common tumors of the perivascular epithelioid cell (PEComa) family. Both may be associated with <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (TS) <b>complex.</b> Epithelioid AML (EAML) is a rare variety of AMLs, with a potential aggressive behavior. There are few reports in the English literature addressing on the imaging findings of renal EAMLs, which are considered nonspecific. We present the sonographic, computed tomographic, and magnetic resonance imaging findings of a renal EAML in a pregnant woman with concomitant pulmonary lesions indicative of LAM, without stigmata of TS.

25|$|HMB-45 is nonreactive {{with almost}} all non-melanoma human malignancies, with the {{exception}} of rare tumors showing evidence of melanogenesis (e.g., pigmented schwannoma, clear cell sarcoma) or tumors associated with <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> <b>complex</b> (angiomyolipoma and lymphangiomyoma).|$|E
25|$|On May 28, 2015, the FDA {{approved}} sirolimus {{to treat}} lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare, progressive lung disease that primarily affects {{women of childbearing}} age. This made sirolimus the first drug approved to treat this disease. LAM involves lung tissue infiltration with smooth muscle-like cells with mutations of the <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> <b>complex</b> gene (TSC2). Loss of TSC2 gene function activates the mTOR signaling pathway, resulting in the release of lymphangiogenic growth factors. Sirolimus blocks this pathway.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> <b>complex</b> (TSC) {{is a rare}} multisystem {{genetic disease}} that causes benign tumors {{to grow in the}} brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, liver, eyes, lungs, and skin. A {{combination}} of symptoms may include seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, and lung and kidney disease. TSC is caused by a mutation of either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which code for the proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively. These proteins act as tumor growth suppressors, agents that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation.|$|E
40|$|The TSC 1 /TSC 2 -TOR {{signaling}} pathway [the {{signaling pathway}} {{that includes the}} heterodimeric TSC 1 (<b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> 1 protein) –TSC 2 (<b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> 2 protein) <b>complex</b> and TOR (target of rapamycin) ] regulates various cellular processes, including protein synthesis, in response to growth factors and nutrient availability. Homologs of some pathway components have been reported from animals, fungi, plants, and protozoa. These observations led to {{the perception that the}} whole pathway is evolutionarily conserved throughout eukaryotes. Using complete genome sequences, we show that, contrary to this view, the pathway was built up from a simpler one, present in the ancestral eukaryote, coupling cell growth to energy supplies. Additional elements, such as TSC 1 and TSC 2, were "bolted on" in particular eukaryotic lineages. Our results also suggest that unikonts [Opisthokonta (including animals and fungi) and Amoebozoa] form a monophyletic group with the Excavata and Chromalveolata. A previous proposal, that the root of the eukaryotic "tree of life" lies between the unikonts and other organisms, should therefore be reevaluated. ...|$|R
40|$|Ochratoxin A (OTA) is {{considered}} to be a possible human urinary tract carcinogen, based largely on a rat model, but no molecular genetic changes in the rat carcinomas have yet been defined. The phosphorylated-S 6 ribosomal protein is a marker indicating activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin, which is a serine/threonine kinase with a key role in protein biosynthesis, cell proliferation, transcription, cellular metabolism and apoptosis, while being functionally deregulated in cancer. To assess p-S 6 expression we performed immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumours and normal tissues. Marked intensity of p-S 6 expression was observed in highly proliferative regions of rat renal carcinomas and a rare angiosarcoma, all of which were attributed to prolonged exposure to dietary OTA. Only very small OTA-generated renal adenomas were negative for p-S 6. Examples of rat subcutaneous fibrosarcoma and testicular seminoma, as well as of normal renal tissue, showed no or very weak positive staining. In contrast to the animal model, human renal cell carcinoma, upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma from cases of Balkan endemic nephropathy, and a human angiosarcoma were negative for p-S 6. The combined findings are reminiscent of constitutive changes in the rat <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> gene <b>complex</b> in the Eker strain correlated with renal neoplasms, Therefore rat renal carcinogenesis caused by OTA does not obviously mimic human urinary tract tumourigenesis...|$|R

After several studies conclusively linked mTOR inhibitors to remission in TSC tumors, specifically subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas in children and angiomyolipomas in adults, many US doctors began prescribing sirolimus (Wyeth's Rapamune) and everolimus (Novartis's RAD001) to TSC patients off-label.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundTuberous <b>sclerosis</b> <b>complex</b> is a multisystem {{disorder}} {{that includes a}} range of tuberous sclerosis–associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND). The lifetime prevalence rates of TAND are very high; yet surveys suggest {{that the majority of}} individuals with <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> never receive appropriate assessment or treatment for TAND. To aid systematic enquiry, a TAND Checklist was developed. Here, we performed pilot validation of the TAND Checklist. MethodMixed methods were used across two stages. In stage 1, we gathered feedback on the Checklist from <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> “expert professionals” and “expert parents and caregivers. ” The aim was to examine face and content validity. Stage 2 involved the administration of the refined TAND Checklist to 20 parents of individuals with <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> concurrently with four widely used validated rating scales, to examine external validity and obtain qualitative feedback on face-to-face administration of the TAND Checklist. ResultsTwenty professionals and 62 parents and caregivers from 28 countries participated in the pilot. The TAND Checklist demonstrated good face and content validity with high overall mean and median scores. Qualitative analysis highlighted concerns about the likely use of the TAND Checklist, suggesting that family members and individuals with <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> should drive usage. Stage 2 results showed moderate-to-very good external validity across TAND domain and key subdomains. Internal consistency of domains and subdomains was acceptable to very good. Ninety-three percent of all participants (93 %) reported four or more lifetime TAND behavioral difficulties.
