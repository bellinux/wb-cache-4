5|$|According to Liz Tynan from James Cook University, the Maralinga {{tests were}} a {{striking}} {{example of what}} can happen when the popular media are unable to report on activities that the government may be <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide.</b> Maralinga was an example of extreme secrecy, but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as Avon Hudson spoke out and political scrutiny became more intense. The investigative journalist Brian Toohey ran a series of stories in the Australian Financial Review in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.|$|E
5|$|The Mew Mews {{are led by}} {{the main}} character, Ichigo Momomiya, whose first task is to gather the other four Mew Mews: Minto Aizawa, Retasu Midorikawa, Bu-Ling Huang, and Zakuro Fujiwara. As the series progresses, Ichigo goes from having a crush on Masaya Aoyama to {{becoming}} his girlfriend while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> her secret double life from him. The series antagonists include three aliens, Quiche, Pie, and Tart, and their leader, Deep Blue. Originally from Earth, the aliens were forced to leave long ago due to deadly environmental changes. They have returned to kill the humans, who they feel are destroying their planet, and reclaim the planet. In a la Mode, middle school student Berry Shirayuki is introduced as the sixth Mew Mew and, {{in the absence of}} Ichigo, the temporary leader of the Mew Mews. A la Mode also introduces new set of antagonists, the Saint Rose Crusaders, a group of human teenagers with various psychic abilities with a desire to create their own utopia. Led by Duke, they make several attempts to kill Berry, eventually turning the local populace against the Mew Mews.|$|E

25|$|In February 2002, Gilani {{went to a}} LeT {{training}} camp and did a three-week introductory course on LeT ideology and jihad. That summer, Serrill Headley, who by then {{had moved to the}} town of Oxford, Pennsylvania with her brother, confided to friends that her son had become a religious fanatic and had been to terrorist {{training camp}}s. While Gilani was on a catering visit to his mother's house, one of her friends, Phyllis Keith, noticed that he parked his car behind her residence as if he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> it. Keith reported Gilani to the FBI office in Philadelphia, which apparently did not follow through with an investigation.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a stable}} {{population}} of woodland caribou throughout {{a large portion}} of the Gwich’in Settlement Area and are an important food source for Gwich’in although they harvest them less than other caribou. Gwich’in living in Inuvik, Aklavik, Fort McPherson, and Tsiigehtchic harvest woodland caribou but not as much as other caribou. The Gwich'in prefer to hunt Porcupine caribou or the barren-ground Blue Nose herd, who travel in large herds, when they are available. Many hunters claimed that woodland caribou that form very small groups, are wilder, both hard to see and hard to hunt. They are very smart, cunning and elusive. However, at times due to their natural curiosity, they may freeze, standing as if they were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> unlike the Porcupine of Bluenose caribou that will outrun a hunter.|$|E
25|$|Firefighters, {{who were}} called by Andreyev {{two hours after}} the fire started, were not {{prepared}} to battle the blaze that raged in the gymnasium. One fire truck crew arrived after two hours at their own initiative but with only 200 litres of water and unable to connect to the nearby hydrants. The first water came at 15:28, nearly {{two and a half}} hours after the start of the fire; the second fire engine arrived at 15:43. Few ambulances were available to transport the hundreds of injured victims, who were mostly driven to hospital in private cars. One suspected militant was lynched on the scene by a mob of civilians, an event filmed by the Sky News crew, while an unarmed militant was captured alive by the OMON troops while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> under their truck (he was later identified as Nur-Pashi Kulayev). Some of the dead insurgents appeared to be mutilated by the commandos.|$|E

25|$|His own {{far left}} inclinations were by then {{contrasting}} with his civil service positions, which he maintained {{even as his}} daughter Ecaterina was becoming a persona non grata. In 1923, Arbore published a new installment of his memoirs, as În temnițele rusești ("In the Russian Dungeons"). In March 1924, he replaced Vasile Ghenzul as editorial director of Furnica ("The Ant"). The cooperativist and agrarian bimonthly was published in Bessarabia, and printed a Russian-language supplement. He was still {{a contributor to the}} central leftist press: in December 1926, Adevărul published his piece about the Serbian politician Nikola Pašić, defunct leader of the People's Radical Party. During this interval, Ecaterina tried to return to Romania. According to one interpretation, she was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> her growing disillusionment with communism under the pretext that she needed {{to take care of her}} ailing father. The Romanian authorities did not allow her entry into the country, and she was forced back. Zamfir and his wife had earlier adopted Dumitru's young child, Zamfir Dumitru Arbore.|$|E
25|$|The third Season sees Cheryl still battling to {{keep her}} family on the {{straight}} and narrow. Both the men in her life are inside – Wolf after turning himself in to the cops {{as part of his}} master plan to frame Judd; Judd from being framed by Wolf. She borrows money from Gary Savage to pay for a better lawyer for Judd, which results in his release but the debt causes a strain in their relationship. Aurora dies in a road accident while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> her ex-boyfriend's drugs after Van called the police on him, spiraling Van into depression. Loretta is outraged when Hayden edits their film to be more explicit for commercial gain, breaks up with him as punishment, and harasses him after he flatly accepts it instead of trying to win her back. This escalates until he leaves, and she burns down his house. After Hayden has left, she discovers she is pregnant by him. Bruce breaks up with Pascalle after he sees her (edited to be more explicit than she actually performed) porn movie. Jethro finds love in Danielle, a single mother and ex-wife of Gary. Ted becomes suspicious of Gary and tracks down Wolf, only to find Gary is Wolf's half brother. Over the season Munter develops a relationship with Kasey and marries her in the final episode.|$|E
25|$|In September 1609, the Japanese {{survivors}} of the Macau affair of 1608 {{had come back to}} tell their version of events to their lord Arima Harunobu, and the news was reported to Ieyasu. The ex-shogun reprimanded Hasegawa for <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> the matter, and ordered him to make a full investigation. Hasegawa drew up a lengthy report taking the side of Arima, who wanted revenge for his men, saying the Macau affidavits had been attained by the Portuguese under duress and should be considered void. Both Hasegawa and Arima advocated for the forcible takeover of the Nossa Senhora da Graça and its cargo, but Ieyasu was hesitant on this point since such a move could endanger the annual Nagasaki-Macau trade. The final push Ieyasu needed came unexpectedly, when a Spanish ship sailing from Manila to Mexico was wrecked off the coast of eastern Japan in the same month. When Ieyasu received the Spanish survivors in his court at Sunpu, he asked their leader Rodrigo de Vivero y Aberrucia, the newly replaced governor of the Philippines, if the Spaniards could supply the bulk of silk imports to Japan like the Portuguese. Aberrucia rashly replied that they could easily send three ships to Japan yearly. Ieyasu, now convinced that he could replace the Portuguese merchants with the Spaniards, the Dutch, and his own red seal ships, ordered Hasegawa and Arima to arrest Pessoa at all costs.|$|E

500|$|Whence, in {{the name}} of Count Buffon and Baron Cuvier, came those dogs that I saw in Typee? Dogs!—Big hairless rats rather; all with smooth, shining, {{speckled}} hides—fat sides, and very disagreeable faces. Whence could they have come? That they were not the indigenous production of the region, I am firmly convinced. Indeed they seemed aware of their being interlopers, looking fairly ashamed, and always <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> themselves in some dark corner. It was plain enough they did not feel at home in the vale—that they wished themselves well out of it, and back to the ugly country from which they must have come.|$|E

Jim Farber of New York Daily News said that Jackson [...] "snarled" [...] while singing, that the song [...] "clicked" [...] and has an [...] "original clattering rhythm". The review of HIStory in The Washington Times noted of [...] "They Don't Care About Us": [...] " [...] follows fast, inviting more pathos – and more controversy.

500|$|Clark {{set about}} arming the {{resistance}} and training them in methods of warfare. He had {{been instructed to}} avoid arming the communists where possible, his superiors fearing for their actions after the war, but finding the communists {{to be the most}} organised and well-motivated group in his area proceeded to arm them anyway. He arranged an air drop of arms and explosives, and led the partisans on several railway sabotage expeditions. Clark later recalled that [...] "blowing up railway engines was very great fun". For his work with the partisans he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the third-highest award for gallantry in the Royal Navy. Clark was betrayed and captured by a German patrol in December 1944 whilst <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> in a haystack with four partisans.|$|E
500|$|Cristina Kirchner faced several {{charges in}} court after leaving office. One of those {{concerned}} {{the sale of}} dollar futures at very low prices {{near the end of}} her term of office. This became a problem during Macri's presidency. The operation was carried out by the Central Bank, but judge Claudio Bonadio believes Kirchner is the instigator. Kirchner is also being investigated for her role in [...] "The Route of the K-Money" [...] scandal. A million dollars of her assets is frozen while Bonadio investigates the case. She took advantage of the hearing to organize her first political rally since leaving power. Lázaro Báez who has close ties with the Kirchners was detained in April 2016 as it was suspected that he might flee escape. José López, an official from the ministry of public works, was detained while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> bags filled with millions in cash at a monastery. On 27 December 2016, Federal Judge Julián Ercolini ordered the freezing of US$633m of Kirchner's assets and approved charges of illicit association and fraudulent administration against her. The case presented by Nisman was finally opened for investigation in December 2016.|$|E
