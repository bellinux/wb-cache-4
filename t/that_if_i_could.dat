2500|$|David Attenborough, who {{attended}} {{university in the}} second half of the 1940s, recounted an incident illustrating its lack of acceptance then: [...] "I once asked one of my lecturers why he was not talking to us about continental drift and I was told, sneeringly, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> prove there was a force that could move continents, then he might think about it. The idea was moonshine, I was informed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stewart is {{a lifelong}} {{supporter}} of his local football club Huddersfield Town A.F.C. He was at Wembley Stadium in 2017 when the club won promotion to the top division {{for the first time}} since 1972. Since 2010, he has been president of Huddersfield Town Academy, the club's project for identifying and developing young talent. In an interview with American Theatre, he stated that [...] "From time to time, I have fantasies of becoming a concert pianist. I've been lucky enough through the years to work very closely with the great Emanuel Ax. I've said to him <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> switch places with anyone it would be with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pickford, {{like all}} actors at Biograph, played both bit parts and leading roles, {{including}} mothers, ingenues, charwomen, spitfires, slaves, Native Americans, spurned women, and a prostitute. As Pickford {{said of her}} success at Biograph:I played scrubwomen and secretaries and women of all nationalities ... I decided <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get into as many pictures as possible, I'd become known, {{and there would be}} a demand for my work. She appeared in 51 films in 1909 – almost one a week. While at Biograph, she suggested to Florence La Badie to [...] "try pictures", invited her to the studio and later introduced her to D. W. Griffith, who launched La Badie's career.|$|E

I only wanted you to {{understand}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> chose <b>I</b> <b>could</b> cut a very different figure--that my wife wouldn't {{have to live in}} a suburb." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Lily;--to {{be rid of}} you in <b>that</b> way. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see you {{put your}} hand in his as his promised wife, I think that I should be the happiest woman in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It feels sore all over, and {{sometimes}} spins like a top. But I wouldn't care about <b>that</b> <b>if</b> only <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get <b>that</b> money back. Can't you and Spud go after that rascal?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Axelrod {{contemplated}} {{taking a}} break from politics during the 2008 presidential campaign, as five of the candidates—Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, Chris Dodd and Tom Vilsack—were past clients. Personal ties between Axelrod and Hillary Clinton made it difficult, as she had raised significant funds for epilepsy on behalf of a foundation co-founded by Axelrod's wife and mother, Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy (CURE). (Axelrod's daughter suffers from developmental disabilities associated with chronic epileptic seizures.) Axelrod's wife even said that a 1999 conference Clinton convened to find a cure for the condition was [...] "one {{of the most important things}} anyone has done for epilepsy." [...] Axelrod ultimately decided to participate in the Obama campaign, and served as chief strategist and media advisor for Obama. He told The Washington Post, [...] "I thought <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help Barack Obama get to Washington, then I would have accomplished something great in my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Martha Wright {{replaced}} Martin in {{the role}} of Maria on Broadway in October 1961, followed by Karen Gantz in July 1962, Jeannie Carson in August 1962 and Nancy Dussault in September 1962. Jon Voight, who eventually married co-star Lauri Peters, was a replacement for Rolf. The national tour starred Florence Henderson as Maria and Beatrice Krebs as Mother Abbess. It opened at the Grand Riviera Theater, Detroit, on February 27, 1961, and closed November 23, 1963, at the O'Keefe Centre, Toronto. Henderson was succeeded by Barbara Meister in June 1962. Theodore Bikel was not satisfied playing the role of the Captain, because of the role's limited singing, [...] and Bikel did not like to play the same role over and over again. In his autobiography, he writes: [...] "I promised myself then <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> afford it, I would never do a run as long as that again." [...] The original Broadway cast album sold three million copies.|$|E
2500|$|A third enemy plane {{appeared}} in my ‘10 o’clock’, {{from the right}} to the left: in simple words, almost in the opposite direction. [...] The first MiG zoomed away and I engaged the afterburner to get in an attack position against this new enemy. [...] I reared up my aircraft in a 45 degree angle, inside his turn. [...] He was turning to the left, so I pulled the stick and barrel-rolled to the right. [...] Thanks to this maneuver, I found myself above him, half upside down. [...] I held it until the MiG finished his turn, calculating the time so <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> keep on turning behind him, I would get on his tail, with a deflection angle of 20 degrees, {{at a distance of}} 1,500 yards. [...] That was exactly what happened. [...] He never saw me. [...] Behind and lower than him, I could clearly see his silhouette against the sun when I launched two Sidewinders. One of them impacted and tore apart his right wing.|$|E
6000|$|... "So it {{is settled}} that I am going. The gunboats are to escort us for some distance. Were {{it not for}} Gordon, I should feel delighted at the prospect. It is horrible to leave him--one of the noblest Englishmen!--alone to his fate. My only {{consolation}} is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> remained <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not avert it, but should only be a sharer in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} impossible," [...] and Boone bent {{his head a}} little as he made the best of it. [...] "I see <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> {{necessary}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> rely on Miss Haldane's kindness a second time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "your allegory {{would have}} a dismal end if you worked it out. It is getting as dark as pitch, and there's a good deal in <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> only <b>I</b> <b>could</b> express myself." ...|$|R
2500|$|I {{could have}} done lots more, put in much more work and {{developed}} more pictures, but I had also a desire to say what I felt about life. Simple things like a little picture in the window or {{the corner of the}} studio or an old stove in the kitchen have always been fascinating to me. They are very much alive, these flowers and grasses with the dew on them. Stieglitz always said, [...] "What have you got to say?" [...] I think in a few small cases I've said a few things, expressed how I felt, trying to show the horror of poverty or the beauty of black people. I think that in photography what you've done is what you've had to say. In everything this has been the message of my life. A simple supper, being with someone you love, seeing a deer come around to eat or drink at the barn - I like things like <b>that.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make one true, quiet photograph, I would much prefer it to having a lot of answers.|$|E
2500|$|Novak {{received}} an Alumni Achievement Award from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1997. Novak frequently visited {{his alma mater}} and interacted with students, establishing a scholarship in his name to support English and rhetoric majors in 1992. He spoke at the college’s May 1998 commencement, urging graduates to use their education as a [...] "bulwark against tyranny." [...] Novak {{also served as a}} Radford Visiting Professor of Journalism for Baylor University in 1987. He was the 2001 winner of the National Press Club’s 'Fourth Estate Award' for lifetime achievement in journalism as well. Novak appears in the 2008 award-winning documentary on political strategist Lee Atwater, [...] In the film, Novak says [...] "He tried to get me to write about Governor Dukakis having psychiatric problems but it really was a slander. He thought my weakness was <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get an exclusive story, I would jump at it, bite at it and not be as careful as I should be. That may be true, but I was careful enough not to get involved in that one." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{wanted to}} tell her <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do {{anything}} at all, she had only to command.|$|E
6000|$|... "Alan," [...] I said, [...] "it's not the want of will: it's the {{strength}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> <b>I</b> would; but {{as sure as}} I'm alive I cannot." ...|$|R
60|$|At night sometimes, as I lay awake, I {{would tell}} myself <b>that</b> <b>if</b> only <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see her or even {{hear from her}} the {{struggle}} would be easier. It was her total disappearance from my life that made it so hard for me. I had nothing to help me to fight.|$|R
40|$|In 1989 when I {{graduated}} from library school {{and looked around}} for {{a job as a}} Japanese studies librarian, I worried that I would be limited to working in one of a dozen research universities in large metropolitan areas. <b>That</b> was <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> convince someone to hire a Canadian librarian who was neither a native speake...|$|R
6000|$|... “I am {{not asking}} you to, mademoiselle; I am only saying {{how it could be}} managed, and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get back to England I might aid your lover.” ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. CHINN Well, sir, I thought that, perhaps--you see, sir, {{he has got}} {{a brother}} in Canada who would help him; and I thought <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ship him off - ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know that," [...] said Tedham. [...] "That is {{the reason}} why I should like to see Mrs. March. I believe <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see her, I could {{convince}} her." ...|$|E
5000|$|He added: [...] "I regret {{not having}} {{been able to}} wear the Greek {{national}} jersey more than once. And I regret not having made a career abroad. I {{would have liked to}} play in a better league, to have enjoyed football at <b>that</b> level. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> turn back the clock, I would do some things differently." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'With such {{health as}} mine,' replied John, quietly, 'I have long {{made up my}} mind <b>that,</b> even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> enter on a fresh attachment, it would not be right. I am not likely to live many years, and I wish to form no new ties. You will oblige me, ma'am, by not {{bringing}} forward this subject again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand," [...] he said, [...] "it is {{etiquette}} for music-hall {{artists in}} their spare time to eat--er--fried fish with their fingers. Must I do <b>that?</b> <b>I</b> doubt <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> manage it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir. Captain Ewart, {{who most}} kindly advised me as to my outfit, said <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> find an {{intelligent}} native here, {{it would be}} better than taking a man from Cairo." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do it,--which of course I can't,--I would not sooner {{do it for}} you, who are my own flesh and blood, than for him, who is a stranger?" ...|$|E
60|$|LADY TEAZLE. I {{doubt they}} do indeed--and I will fairly own to you, <b>that</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{be persuaded to}} do wrong it would be by Sir Peter's ill-usage--sooner than your honourable Logic, after all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Eric, last night, to be honest, <b>I</b> thought <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> found <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not help}} this girl, {{it would be}} the best thing that could happen, as far as you were concerned. But since I have seen her--well, I would give my right hand <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do {{anything}} for her. She is the wife for you, if we could make her speak; yes, and by the memory of your mother"--David brought his fist down on the window sill with a force that shook the casement,--"she is the wife for you, speech or no speech, if we could only convince her of it." ...|$|R
60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. When I {{was going}} away {{he said to}} me <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>could</b> give him any private {{information}} of real value he would make me a very rich man. I was dazed at the prospect he held out to me, and my ambition and my desire for power were at that time boundless. Six weeks later certain private documents passed through my hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop a moment, Cora. I do {{not know}} how it may be yet. But this <b>I</b> know, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> without cowardice <b>I</b> <b>could</b> avoid this task, I would {{certainly}} avoid it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing; only, I know <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get any man {{to look at}} me as {{that man}} looks at you, I'd--I don't know what I'd do. But he hates me. Oh, how he hates me!' ...|$|E

60|$|Monsieur my godfather--You make refusal {{singularly}} {{hard for}} me when you appeal to me upon the ground of affection.

There is too much between M. de La Tour d'Azyr and me. Also you do me and my class--whatever it may be--less than justice when you say that obligations of honour are not binding upon us. So binding do <b>I</b> count them, <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not now draw back.|$|R
6000|$|He {{took this}} seriously. [...] "I thought of <b>that,</b> but even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{get into a}} league team, which is hardly probable, it wouldn't lead anywhere. You see, I'm getting up an ambition. I want to be rich and powerful." ...|$|R
