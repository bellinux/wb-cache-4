5|$|In ancient Persia, saffron (Crocus sativus 'Hausknechtii') was {{cultivated}} at Derbena and Isfahan in the 10th century BC. There, Persian saffron threads {{have been}} found interwoven into ancient Persian royal carpets and funeral shrouds. Saffron was used by ancient Persian worshippers as a ritual offering to their deities, and as a brilliant yellow dye, perfume, and a medicine. Thus, saffron threads would be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy. Indeed, Persian saffron threads, used <b>to</b> <b>spice</b> foods and teas, were widely suspected by foreigners of being a drugging agent and an aphrodisiac. These fears grew to forewarn travelers to abstain from eating saffron-laced Persian cuisine. In addition, Persian saffron was dissolved in water with sandalwood {{to use as a}} body wash after heavy work and perspiration under the hot Persian sun. Later, Persian saffron was heavily used by Alexander the Great and his forces during their Asian campaigns. They mixed saffron into teas and dined on saffron rice. Alexander personally used saffron sprinkled in warm bath water, taking after Cyrus the Great. Much like Cyrus, he believed it would heal his many wounds, and his faith in saffron grew with each treatment. He even recommended saffron baths for the ordinary men under him. The Greek soldiers, taken with saffron's perceived curative properties, continued the practice after they returned to Macedonia.|$|E

The meat with gravy, potatoes, egg and yardlong beans are served {{side by side on}} a plate, with the aloo puri folded in fours on top. One then has the option <b>to</b> <b>spice</b> the dish with a very hot chutney made of Madame Jeanette peppers.|$|E

Although Chingay parades are held {{throughout}} Malaysia and Singapore, Penang's Chingay is unique in that the balancing of enormous flags on one's forehead or hands is an essential component. It was said that Singapore even copied Penang's Chingay processions in order <b>to</b> <b>spice</b> up its own Chinese New Year festivities. An annual Chingay parade is held in George Town every December, though Chingay performances are also a common feature of Chinese festivities and major state celebrations in Penang.|$|E

The popularity of Duke Leto Atreides has grown through the empire, and he is suspected to be amassing a secret army, which Emperor Shaddam sees as {{a potential}} threat to his rule. Shaddam's plan is to give House Atreides control of the planet Arrakis (also known as Dune), {{the only source of}} spice. Once installed on Arrakis, he intends to have them ambushed by their longtime archenemies, the Harkonnens, with assistance from the Emperor's elite troops, the Sardaukar. The Guild Navigator also commands the Emperor to kill Duke Leto's son, Paul Atreides, a young man who dreams prophetic visions of his purpose. The execution order draws the attention of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, as Paul is tied to its centuries-long Bene Gesserit breeding program which seeks to produce the universe's superbeing, the Kwisatz Haderach. Before he leaves for Arrakis, Paul is tested by the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam by being forced to place his hand in a box which induces excruciating pain. To Mohiam's surprise and eventual satisfaction, he passes the test.|$|E

In the picture, she portrayed Ann Farber, who with her husband and son are held hostage by a pair of sociopathic teenagers. Watts also served as a producer, as this charge was for her [...] "one way <b>to</b> <b>spice</b> up the deal and be involved in all the creative decisions".
