5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs,</b> a film {{adaptation}} of Harris' next Lecter novel, {{was released in}} 1991. However, none of the cast of Manhunter reprise their roles in the later film, although actors Frankie Faison and Dan Butler appear in both films as different and unrelated characters. <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> earned several awards and accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Picture. It {{is one of only}} three films to have won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Screenplay. <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> was followed in turn by a sequel and two prequels: Hannibal, Red Dragon and Hannibal Rising, plus an NBC television series, Hannibal.|$|E
5|$|MGM (current {{holders of}} the rights to <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> and Hannibal) {{released}} the theatrical cut of Manhunter on DVD in a pan-and-scan format in 2004.

Manhunter was also released by itself in September 2007. The studio re-released The Hannibal Lecter Collection on Blu-ray in September 2009.|$|E

5|$|Kemper {{was one of}} five {{serial killers}} (Jerry Brudos, Ed Gein, Ted Bundy, Gary M.

40|$|Silence can {{be harmful}} to patients, their loved ones, and doctors within <b>the</b> {{contexts}} <b>of</b> illness and bereavement.

5|$|Ted Levine, {{who later}} {{went on to}} play Buffalo Bill in <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs,</b> crashed Manhunter's wrap party {{to spend time with}} Petersen, who he knew from their days in Chicago theater.

5|$|Set {{ten years}} after <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs,</b> Hannibal follows Starling's {{attempts}} to apprehend Lecter before his surviving victim, Mason Verger, captures him. It is set in Italy and the United States. The novel Hannibal drew attention for its violence. Hannibal broke box office records in the United States, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom in February 2001, but was met with a mixed critical reception.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} The Texas Chain Saw Massacre {{arose in the}} early 1970s while Tobe Hooper was working as an {{assistant}} film director at the University of Texas at Austin and as a documentary cameraman. He had already developed a story involving the elements of isolation, the woods, and darkness. He credited the graphic coverage of violence by San Antonio news outlets as one inspiration for the film and based elements of the plot on serial killer Ed Gein in 1950s Wisconsin; Gein inspired other horror films such as Psycho (1960) and <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> (1991). During development, Hooper used the working titles of Headcheese and Leatherface.|$|E
5|$|The dump months {{evolved over}} the course of the 20th century. Although during the studio era most major {{releases}} followed annual patterns similar to today's, several classics like The Kid, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre were released during January. Since the decline of the studios, however, memorable films from the dump months have become rare exceptions. The most notable is <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs,</b> a well-reviewed box office smash released in late January 1991 that went on to win that year's Academy Award for Best Picture. Several years before that, Dirty Dancing and Fatal Attraction became hits following releases in August and September respectively.|$|E

5|$|The film had a {{difficult}} and occasionally troubling pre-production history. When the novel was published in 1999, <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> director Jonathan Demme, screenwriter Ted Tally, and actress Jodie Foster all declined {{to be involved in}} its adaptation. Ridley Scott became attached as director after the success of Gladiator (2000), and eventually signed onto the project after reading the script pitched by Dino De Laurentiis, who produced Manhunter (1986), based on the 1981 Harris novel Red Dragon. After the departure of Foster and screenwriter Tally, Julianne Moore took on Foster's role while David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote the screenplay.|$|E
5|$|Carter's initial {{pitch for}} The X-Files was {{rejected}} by Fox executives. He fleshed out the concept and returned a few weeks later, when they commissioned the pilot. Carter worked with NYPD Blue producer Daniel Sackheim to further develop the pilot, drawing stylistic inspiration from the 1988 documentary The Thin Blue Line and the British television series Prime Suspect. Inspiration also came from Carter's memories of The Twilight Zone {{as well as from}} <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs,</b> which provided the impetus for framing the series around agents from the FBI, in order to provide the characters with a more plausible reason for being involved in each case than Carter believed was present in Kolchak. Carter was determined to keep {{the relationship between the two}} leads strictly platonic, basing their interactions on the characters of Emma Peel and John Steed in The Avengers series.|$|E
5|$|Apart from a cameo role in {{the comedy}} The Ladies Man, Moore's only other {{appearance}} in 2000 was in a short-film adaptation of Samuel Beckett's play Not I. In early 2001, she appeared as FBI Agent Clarice Starling in Hannibal, a sequel to the Oscar winning film <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lambs.</b> Jodie Foster had declined to reprise the role, and director Ridley Scott eventually cast Moore, over Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchett, Gillian Anderson, and Helen Hunt. The change in actress received considerable attention from the press, but Moore claimed she {{was not interested in}} upstaging Foster. Despite mixed reviews, Hannibal earned $58 million in its opening weekend and finished as the tenth-highest-grossing film of the year. Moore starred in three more 2001 releases: with David Duchovny in the science fiction–comedy Evolution, in her husband's dramatic film World Traveler, and with Kevin Spacey, Judi Dench, and Cate Blanchett in The Shipping News. All three films were poorly received.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} also {{nominated}} for Best Picture and Best Sound. It {{was the first}} animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture, and remained the only animated film nominated until 2009 when the Best Picture field was widened to ten nominees, and it remains the only animated film nominated for the award when it had five nominees.
