50|$|But school {{counseling}} in the 1980s and early 1990s in the United States was {{not seen as}} a player in educational reform efforts buffeting the educational community. The danger was the profession becoming irrelevant as the standards-based educational movement gained strength in the 1990s with little evidence of systemic effectiveness for school counselors. In response, Campbell & Dahir (1997) consulted widely with school counselors at the elementary, middle, and high school levels and created <b>the</b> <b>ASCA</b> <b>National</b> Standards for School Counseling with three core domains (Academic, Career, Personal/Social), nine standards, and specific competencies and indicators for K-12 students.|$|R

40|$|Expressive arts therapies are a rich {{resource}} {{for use with}} children and adolescents, who are often unresponsive to traditional talk therapy, and highly useful to school counselors who must overcome cultural, language, and ability barriers that are increasingly present in diverse and multicultural school settings. This is the first book written specifically for school counselors about using creative and expressive arts counseling techniques in school settings. It presents over 100 interventions using art, drama, music, writing, dance, and movement that school counselors can easily incorporate into their practices with individual students and groups, and in classroom settings. These creative interventions, based on the American School Counselor Association (<b>ASCA)</b> <b>National</b> <b>Model</b> framework, support <b>the</b> key student domains of academic, career, and personal/social development. The text also meets the important demand for accountability in school counseling by providing guidelines for evaluating the effectiveness of each intervention. Addressing such issues as emotional expression, social skills development, managing anger/aggression, developing self-esteem, working well with diverse peers, career exploration, and academic skill development, the book is organized by specific types of expressive arts therapies {{and how they can}} be used to support different domains in <b>the</b> <b>ASCA</b> model. Each intervention outlines the presenting concerns for which it is most useful, appropriate grade levels, required materials, preparation needed, step-by-step instructions, modifications for special needs students, and an outcome assessment plan. A handy quick reference chart helps readers to quickly locate appropriate interventions for specific concerns. Ideal for the school counselor, social worker, or psychologist who may not have specific training in arts therapies, this book can also help trained arts therapists who will be working in a school setting to select appropriate interventions.

40|$|Students, {{of all the}} {{educational}} stakeholders, are the last {{to have a voice}} in school reform efforts, yet their voices could hold substantial power in how to improve their success in school. Since school counselors are trained in how to engage students in confidential dialogue, school counselors are {{in the best position to}} participate in discussions with students around their perspectives on school reform efforts. The current major school reform effort is the implementation of the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). The main goal of the Common Core State Standards is to help prepare all students for college and career readiness. As recommended by the American School Counselor Association's (<b>ASCA's)</b> <b>National</b> <b>Model,</b> school counselors are encouraged to help students be successful in the three domains of academic, career, and personal/social development. It is utilizing these three domains, the themes, and the framework of the <b>National</b> <b>Model</b> that school counselors can align their programs to the CCSS and help their schools improve in preparing all students for college and career readiness. In order to begin aligning the school counseling program with the goals of the CCSS in the area of preparing students for college at Victoria High School, research was conducted using grounded theory and action research supported by Lewis and Winkelman's (2014) Participatory Inquiry Process (PIP) approach. The research was triangulated through reviewing academic transcripts, conducting student focus groups, and connecting the data to the literature.

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a brief overview}} of the outcome research on psychotherapy with children and adolescents. Outcome research indicates that psychotherapy can be effective with both children and adolescents, with meta-analyses indicating that youth who participated in this type of intervention tended to score on the outcome measures half of a standard deviation or more above those who did not receive any intervention. Little is known about the process of psychotherapy with children, but there are some indications that the therapeutic relationship is important. Moreover, there is some research that supports the assumption that certain types of treatment are most helpful with specific clinical issues. In <b>the</b> <b>ASCA</b> <b>National</b> Model[R] proposed by the American School Counselor Association (2005 a), school counselors have the responsibility for promoting the academic, career, and personal/social development of all students. This includes students who are experiencing difficulties and those who may meet diagnostic criteria for a psychiatric disorder. Furthermore, policy initiatives at national and state levels, such as the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (2002), are requiring that all children succeed academically; however, this may be difficult for children who are experiencing emotional problems. The number of students experiencing difficulties {{does not appear to be}} trivial. For example, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (2005) recently reported that an estimated 2. 7 million children are noted by their parents to suffer from noticeable or severe emotional or behavioral problems that may interfere with their family life, their ability to learn, and their abilities to make friends...|$|R
