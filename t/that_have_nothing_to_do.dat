500|$|Western astrology {{has taken}} the earth's axial {{precession}} (also called precession of the equinoxes) into account since Ptolemy's Almagest, so the 'first point of Aries', {{the start of the}} astrological year, continually moves against the background of the stars. The tropical zodiac has no connection to the stars, and as long as no claims are made that the constellations themselves are in the associated sign, astrologers avoid the concept that precession seemingly moves the constellations. Charpak and Broch, noting this, referred to astrology based on the tropical zodiac as being [...] "...empty boxes <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with anything and are devoid of any consistency or correspondence with the stars."

500|$|Though visual mimicry through animal {{coloration}} is {{most obvious}} to humans, other senses such as olfaction (smell) or hearing may be involved, {{and more than}} one type of signal may be employed. [...] Mimicry may involve morphology, behaviour, and other properties. In any case, the mimetic signal always functions because it resembles that of another organism. In evolutionary terms, this phenomenon is a form of co-evolution. It can involve an evolutionary arms race if mimicry negatively affects the model, and the model can evolve a different appearance from the mimic.p161 Mimicry {{should not be confused with}} other forms of convergent evolution, which occurs when species come to resemble each other by adapting to similar lifestyles <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with a common signal receiver. Mimics may have different models for different life cycle stages, or they may be polymorphic, with different individuals imitating different models. Models themselves may have more than one mimic, though frequency dependent selection favours mimicry where models outnumber mimics. Models tend to be relatively closely related organisms, but mimicry of vastly different species is also known. Most known mimics are insects, though many other animal mimics are known. Plants and fungi may also be mimics, though less research has been carried out in this area.|$|E

2500|$|LeVay {{discusses}} {{scientific research}} on sexual orientation conducted since his 1991 {{study of the}} hypothalamus, writing that the research supports the conclusion that sexual orientation {{is a product of}} the interactions between sex hormones and the developing brain, which predispose people's minds toward masculinity or femininity. LeVay argues that sexual orientation should be understand as an aspect of gender, seen from a biological perspective. He defines [...] "sexual orientation" [...] as [...] "the trait that predisposes us to experience sexual attraction to people of the same sex as ourselves (homosexual, gay, or lesbian), to persons of the other sex (heterosexual or straight), or to both sexes (bisexual). He criticizes the work of Alfred Kinsey, writing that while Kinsey took sexual behavior into account in judging a person's sexual orientation, that approach suffers from the problem that [...] "sexual behavior is influenced by many factors <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with one's basic sexual feelings and that are changeable over time."

Penn and Teller often close episodes with an impassioned ethical plea against whatever they are debunking, summarizing how this particular belief is harmful and should be resisted. The presenters distinguish between believers (often explaining that Penn and Teller themselves {{would like to believe}} these things are true, and showing compassion to the people who do think the things are true) and those they see as charlatans out for money or to advance a political agenda, at whom their anger is directed. For example, in their premiere episode, they debunk the idea that psychics can talk to the dead. While expressing the utmost sympathy towards people who are desperate for a chance to speak to a loved one who has died, they explain that charlatans take advantage of this love to get money from people, and deliver false messages <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the genuine character of the departed.|$|E
