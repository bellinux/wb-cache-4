5|$|A {{key action}} which {{physically}} connects {{the keys and}} the windchests is a mechanical or <b>tracker</b> action. Connection is achieved {{through a series of}} rods called trackers. When the organist depresses a key, the corresponding <b>tracker</b> pulls open its pallet, allowing wind to enter the pipe.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the longer}} shadow the array casts when tilted at a steeper angle, {{this area is}} {{typically}} about 10% higher for an adjustable tilt array or a single axis <b>tracker,</b> and 20% higher for a 2-axis <b>tracker,</b> though these figures will {{vary depending on the}} latitude and topography.|$|E

30|$|Nowadays, <b>trackers</b> and {{barcodes}} {{are used}} to combat the crime. <b>Trackers</b> are {{being used as a}} preventing tool in the form of secret pattern on the products to avoid people from thieving. Apart from preventing tool, <b>trackers</b> can also be help to track down those items which are stolen or missing. <b>Trackers</b> can also be used for security purposes as they can be used to avert prisoners from absconding. In this case, nano <b>trackers</b> are injected into the prisoners’ body which helps to track them if they escape. Nano <b>trackers</b> are also enabling to monitor the convicts after being released. Nano <b>trackers</b> help to track them easily if they are again involved in a crime (Hogard and Ellis 2007).|$|R
50|$|<b>Trackers</b> detect or monitor head, hand or body {{movements}} and send {{that information to}} the computer. The computer then translates it and ensures that position and orientation are reflected accurately in the virtual world. Tracking is important in presenting the correct viewpoint, coordinating the spatial and sound information presented to users as well the tasks or functions that they could perform. 3D <b>trackers</b> {{have been identified as}} mechanical, magnetic, ultrasonic, optical, and hybrid inertial. Examples of <b>trackers</b> include motion <b>trackers,</b> eye <b>trackers,</b> and data gloves.|$|R

5|$|Amanda {{encounters}} several antagonists {{over the}} course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These foes can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means. There is also a single alien creature that pursues the player. The alien creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion <b>tracker</b> to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the alien finding the player. For example, if the alien is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract the alien, forcing the player to wisely use the <b>tracker</b> and remove it as soon as it detects motion. The motion <b>tracker</b> cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine whether the alien creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.|$|E

30|$|An {{ordinary}} {{example of}} a user input would be a mouse and keyboard being used to type or navigate through the operating system. The same tools as mouse and keyboard {{can be used in}} an immersive virtual reality simulation but would not yield the same level of presence as more natural interactions. A sense of presence is increased when the user begins to see that their own movements are emulated in the simulation. Therefore, the naturalness of the input for the user has a direct correlation to the sense of presence. The technology that is being used for inputs in immersive virtual reality can be categorized under these categories: optical <b>trackers,</b> acoustic <b>trackers,</b> mechanical <b>trackers,</b> magnetic <b>trackers,</b> inertial <b>trackers,</b> data gloves, and eye <b>trackers</b> [113].|$|R

5|$|Over {{the course}} of her career, over thirty {{aircraft}} were either lost or heavily damaged while operating from Melbourne. The majority of the aircraft ditched or crashed over the side, but some losses were due to catapult or arrestor cable failures.

40|$|State {{commissions}} {{have not}} given adequate attention to the negative features of cost <b>trackers,</b> which {{are at odds with}} the public interest. Specifically, cost <b>trackers</b> diminish the positive effects of regulatory lag and retrospective reviews in deterring utility waste and cost inefficiency. <b>Trackers</b> also could reduce regulatory scrutiny in evaluating cost prudence. ...|$|R
50|$|The axis of {{rotation}} for vertical single axis <b>trackers</b> is vertical {{with respect to the}} ground. These <b>trackers</b> rotate from East to West {{over the course of the}} day. Such <b>trackers</b> are more effective at high latitudes than are horizontal axis <b>trackers.</b> Field layouts must consider shading to avoid unnecessary energy losses and to optimize land utilization. Also optimization for dense packing is limited due to the nature of the shading over the course of a year. Vertical single axis <b>trackers</b> typically have the face of the module oriented at an angle with respect to the axis {{of rotation}}. As a module tracks, it sweeps a cone that is rotationally symmetric around the {{axis of rotation}}.|$|R

5|$|Concentrator {{photovoltaics}} (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for {{the purpose}} of electrical power production. Contrary to conventional photovoltaic systems, it uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, multi-junction solar cells. Solar concentrators of all varieties may be used, and these are often mounted on a solar <b>tracker</b> {{in order to keep the}} focal point upon the cell as the sun moves across the sky. Luminescent solar concentrators (when combined with a PV-solar cell) can also be regarded as a CPV system. Concentrated photovoltaics are useful as they can improve efficiency of PV-solar panels drastically.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{absence of}} a {{commonly}} adopted performance evaluation framework is hampering advances {{in the design of}} effective video <b>trackers.</b> In this paper, we present a singlescore evaluation measure and a protocol to objectively compare <b>trackers.</b> The proposed measure evaluates tracking accuracy and failure, and combines them for both summative and formative performance assessment. The proposed protocol is composed of a set of trials that evaluate the robustness of <b>trackers</b> on a range of test scenarios representing several real-world conditions. The protocol is validated on a set of sequences with a diversity of targets (head, vehicle, person) and challenges (occlusions, background clutter, pose changes, scale changes) using six stateof-the-art <b>trackers,</b> highlighting their strengths and weaknesses on more than 187000 frames. The software implementing the protocol and the evaluation results are made available online and new results can be included, thus facilitating the comparison of <b>trackers.</b> Index Terms—Performance evaluation, video <b>trackers,</b> evaluation measure, protocol, trials.
