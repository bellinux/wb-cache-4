5|$|A small {{model of}} this toy is {{exhibited}} in Tipu Sultan's wooden palace in Bangalore. Although other items associated with Tipu, including his sword, {{have recently been}} purchased and brought back to India by billionaire Vijay Mallya, Tipu's Tiger has not itself been <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> official repatriation request, presumably due to the ambiguity underlying Tipu's image {{in the eyes of}} Indians; his being an object of loathing in the eyes of some Indians while considered a hero by others.|$|E
5|$|Foxgrover was <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ethics investigation. An ethics {{officer for}} the Chicago Board of Ethics {{concluded}} that Foxgrover did not violate the district's ethics ordinance and {{should be allowed to}} keep her $90,000-a-year job as the Park District's director of development.

The {{remaining}} population of agile frogs on Jersey is very small and is restricted to the south west of the island. The species is <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ongoing programme to save it from extinction in Jersey via a collaboration between States of Jersey, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and Jersey Amphibian and Reptile Group (JARG), with support and sponsorship from several other organisations.

5|$|Njörðr {{has been}} <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> amount of {{scholarly}} discourse and theory, often connecting {{him with the}} figure of the much earlier attested Germanic goddess Nerthus, the hero Hadingus, and theorizing on his formerly more prominent place in Norse paganism due to the appearance of his name in numerous place names. Njörðr is sometimes modernly anglicized as Njord, Njoerd, or Njorth.|$|E

5|$|The Nefertiti bust {{has become}} a {{cultural}} symbol of Berlin as well as ancient Egypt. Nefertiti herself has become quite an icon. Nefertiti is widely known for her beauty and versatility. It has also been <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> intense argument between Egypt and Germany over Egyptian demands for its repatriation. It was dragged into controversy by the Body of Nefertiti art exhibition and also by doubts over its authenticity. However various testing {{and analysis of the}} bust have proved it to be authentic.|$|E
5|$|The Skye Cuillin {{mountains}} provide classic {{examples of}} glacial topography and were <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> early published account by James Forbes in 1846 (who {{had become a}} fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh aged only nineteen).

5|$|The {{bridge over}} Swinefleet Warping Drain was <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unusual request from Colonel Thompson in 1906, who asked {{permission}} for 16 of his female potato pickers to cross it {{to reach their}} place of work. To access it, {{they would need to}} walk through the goods yard and along the main line, but it would save them having to walk much further each day. The request was granted, provided that the Colonel indemnified the railway against any claims made if the ladies were involved in an accident.|$|E
5|$|There {{has also}} been {{extensive}} research on heuristic algorithms for solving maximum clique problems without worst-case runtime guarantees, based on methods including branch and bound, local search, greedy algorithms, and constraint programming. Non-standard computing methodologies that have been suggested for finding cliques include DNA computing and adiabatic quantum computation. The maximum clique problem was <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> implementation challenge sponsored by DIMACS in 1992–1993, {{and a collection of}} graphs used as benchmarks for the challenge is publicly available.|$|E
5|$|Coatbridge College {{was built}} as Scotland's first {{college in the}} late 19th century. As Coatbridge has {{moved away from the}} {{traditional}} heavy industries the teaching focus has shifted from traditional industry courses towards commerce, care and the arts. St Ambrose, St Andrew's and Coatbridge High are the best-known secondary schools serving Coatbridge. The first two are Roman Catholic. St Ambrose was <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> HMI follow-up assessment visit in January 2009. Sports journalist and broadcaster Bob Crampsey was formerly headmaster of St Ambrose. Singer and television presenter Michelle McManus is a former pupil of the school. Prominent football referee Willie Collum taught religious education at St Ambrose in the early 2000s.|$|E

5|$|Hard {{surfacing}} {{of roads}} {{in part of}} the Kettle Creek watershed began in 1930 to 1938. The Alvin R. Bush Dam {{was built on the}} creek in the late 1950s to protect against flooding. The creek was <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Operation Scarlift study from 1970 to 1972. A USGS gauge was installed on the stream in 1972. The Kettle Creek Watershed Association (also known as the KWCA) was founded in the late 1990s. The creek became the third Home Rivers initiative of Trout Unlimited in 1998. The main industries in the Kettle Creek watershed in the 21st century are tourism, agriculture, and lumbering.|$|E
5|$|In 1652, the English {{parliament}} {{declared that}} Scotland {{was part of}} the Commonwealth. Various attempts were made to legitimise the union, calling representatives from the Scottish burghs and shires to negotiations and to various English parliaments, where they were always under-represented and had little opportunity for dissent. However, final ratification was delayed by Cromwell's problems with his various parliaments and the union did not become <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> act until 1657. The military administration in Scotland, led by General George Monck, was relatively successful. It managed to enforce law and order, suppressing the banditry of the Moss-troopers and enforcing a form of limited religious toleration, but by introducing English judges largely suspending the Scots law. In 1653–55 there was a major Royalist rising in the Highlands led by William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn and John Middleton, which was defeated at the Battle of Dalnaspidal on 19 July 1654.|$|E
5|$|In April 1948 he {{once again}} {{travelled}} with England to Hampden Park, helping his country to a 2–0 victory; however after the match he was <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> FA inquiry after he claimed tea and scones on his expenses (at {{the cost of}} sixpence). Regardless of this treatment by the FA, the next month he helped England record a 4–0 victory over Italy in Turin. Folklore told that he beat Alberto Eliani {{only to have the}} audacity to then pull a comb from his shorts pocket and comb his hair; the reality was that he simply used his hand to wipe his sweating brow in the beating Italian sun. However the legend would follow him around the world in later life, and spectators in the crowd were convinced that they had witnessed it. Later in the year he played in a goalless draw with Denmark, a 6–2 win over Northern Ireland, a 1–0 win over Wales, and a 6–0 triumph over Switzerland.|$|E
