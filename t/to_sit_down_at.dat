25|$|Mormarevi Brothers {{started their}} {{collaboration}} writing feuilletons for Starshel (Hornet) newspaper, a Bulgarian weekly paper of humour and satire. Their work method was <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{a table in}} Yomtov's small kitchen and figure out subjects and characters while playing cards. Afterwards, they would alternate on the typewriter, but often Stoychev did more of this work.|$|E
25|$|The {{music video}} {{was shot by}} {{director}} Yuri Kanchiku. It depicts miwa {{in a dark room}} with several free-standing doorways. Whenever miwa travels through one of the doorways, she comes into the same room set up differently. The first time, it is set up for a frivolous banquet, with many different people dressed formally. The second time she enters it, the room is set up {{as if it were a}} busy park sidewalk, with many people dressed in work clothes ignoring her. She decides <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a park bench. miwa later finds a birdcage, and the scene switches to depicting her trapped inside the birdcage, with the floor littered with sheet music.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} drum protocol, a drum may {{be thought}} of as a person or being and is to be regarded and respected as such. Drum etiquette is highly important. There are regional variations. The drum is the central symbol of Oklahoma pow wows and is located in the center of the dance floor and pow wow (which are themselves shaped in concentric circles). Southern drums are suspended by four posts, one for each direction. Northern drums are set up on the outside of the dance area, with the host drum in the best position. Drummer-singers are expected to remain at their drum and ready to sing at any moment's notice; a dancer might approach the drum and whistle, fan or gesture his staff over a drum to indicate his request for a song even if it is not that drum group's turn to sing. In some regions it is considered disrespectful to leave a drum completely unattended. Some drum groups do not allow females <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> their drum but welcome them to stand behind the drummers and sing backup harmonies; the reasons for this point vaguely to a variety of tribal stories that attempt to tell the history of drumming as each group understands it. People bring water to the drummers and generally assist the players as needed. (It is also considered a taboo among some nations to discuss spiritual teachings in writing or to name absolute authority in reference to spiritual teachings.) The drum is offered gifts of tobacco during giveaways and musicians acknowledge this by standing.|$|E

60|$|In all the {{countries}} to which I have alluded the guests of the house are expected <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> together <b>at</b> one table. Conversation is at any rate possible; {{and there is the}} show, if not the reality, of society.|$|R

500|$|A doctor prescribes Prozac, a {{real life}} antidepressant, to Kyle for his {{apparent}} love for feces, which he describes as [...] "fecalphilia", a condition perhaps better known by the medical term coprophilia. Composer Philip Glass composes the avant-garde musical score for the non-denominational Christmas play. Stone and Parker both strongly dislike Glass; Parker, who was a music major in college, said, [...] "I really thought you could basically tell a third grader <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a keyboard and mess around and sell it as a Philip Glass album, {{and no one would}} know the difference." [...] The do-it-yourself kit in the live action commercial, in which families can make their own Mr. Hankey, is similar to the Mr. Potato Head toy set.|$|E
500|$|Although Paul Oscar's family {{encouraged}} {{his musical}} talent, his {{parents did not}} get along with each other, and he was bullied by his schoolmates. Paul Oscar recalled: [...] "My nickname was Little Palli, and Palli was chubby, nerdy, someone who never got jokes right, who was afraid of other men." [...] At age 13, {{he realized that he}} found men attractive, and came out to his [...] family at 16. [...] "For the first day, there was nice talk of acceptance, though my father did raise his voice. On the second day, and the third, and the fourth, there was this terrible silence. They treated me like an alien." [...] However, his mother was supportive. She said: [...] "If Páll has the talent to fall in love, he should nurture that talent. And he has as much a right <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> my table with his partner as anybody else does with their partner." ...|$|E
2500|$|Caroline {{was brought}} up with an extreme degree of {{seclusion}} from contact with the opposite sex even for her own time. She was reportedly constantly supervised by her governess and elder ladies, restricted to her room when the family was entertaining guests and ordered to keep away from the windows. She was normally refused permission to attend balls and court functions, and when allowed, she was forbidden to dance. Abbé Baron commented {{during the winter of}} 1789–90: [...] "She is supervised with the greatest severity, as they claim she is already aware of what she is missing. I doubt if the torches of hymen will illuminate for her. Although always attired with style and elegance, she is never allowed to dance", and that as soon as the first dance begun, she was forced <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the whist table with three old ladies. A rare occasion was the wedding of her elder brother Charles, when she was finally allowed to dance, though only with her brother, the groom, and her new brother-in-law, the Prince of Orange – she was, however, still forbidden to dine alone with her brother.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! who?" [...] he said, {{with much}} enjoyment. [...] "I {{tell you it}} did my father’s ’art good to see ’em all dressed up like that; and when I thought of its all being owing <b>to</b> you, <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> home in comfort with a pipe instead of coming {{to thank you for}} it I could not. Not if you was to have paid me I couldn’t." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was sitting}} on a bank picking wild-flowers some hours after the arrival of her party, and {{teaching}} several black children how to make necklaces of them, when the doctor and Rokens happened <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> together <b>at</b> {{the other side of a}} bush which concealed her from their view. Tim was evidently excited, for the tones of his voice were loud and emphatic.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I think Miss Nancy's a-coming round again," [...] said Ben, [...] "for Master Godfrey doesn't look so down-hearted to-night. And I see he's {{for taking}} her away <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> now they're <b>at</b> the end o' the dance: {{that looks like}} sweethearting, that does." ...|$|R
60|$|Her alarm was, indeed, {{much greater}} than he had at first thought: she trembled {{so much that she}} was obliged <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> <b>at</b> which he went up to her full of solicitousness.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{can hardly}} blame her for that," [...] said Mrs. Sprague; [...] "because {{few of the}} best people in the town cared to {{associate}} with Balstrode, and she must have somebody <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her table." ...|$|E
60|$|The chief looked {{pleased at}} the gift, placed {{his hands on}} Will's {{shoulder}} and nodded, and performed the same gesture to Hans. Then he led them towards his hut, and motioned to them <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the foot of the}} tree.|$|E

60|$|And then, {{should he}} be successful, {{what would be the}} reward? Having {{satisfied}} his creditors with half of the widow's fortune, he would be allowed <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> quietly <b>at</b> Barchester, keeping economical house with the remainder. His duty would be to rock the cradle of the late Mr. Bold's child, and his highest excitement a demure party at Plumstead Rectory, should it ultimately turn out that the archdeacon would be sufficiently reconciled to receive him.|$|R
50|$|In the Delicious games, players {{take the}} role of Emily, and are given the task to run a restaurant. Customers come in, alone or in a group, and choose <b>to</b> either <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a table or take out. Emily must serve them their order, and accept payment, before they become {{impatient}} and leave. Order sizes vary from 1 to 2 items for a single customer, and up to 4 items for a group. Fast service and entertainment, along with creative restaurant decorating, can keep the customers happy and result in a bigger tip.|$|R
6000|$|When {{he got in}} {{he wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> once in the little creaky chair by the fire, but Ethel came flitting from the newly bought {{typewriter}} with arms extended and prevented him. [...] "Oh!--it has been dull," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "And so 'ave I," [...] said Aby, who {{had eaten}} a penny loaf in the car, {{and would have}} been delighted <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> that rich table. But he was a little beside himself, and not able to pluck up courage for such an effort.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I shouldn't wonder! And she's an {{extraordinarily}} attractive woman. I'm full of complaints, Everard. There's that other horrible little man, Seaman.

5000|$|The {{ancestor}} of Nash, Martha, and Travis mentions in his closing remarks the following from Martin Luther King Jr.’s [...] "I {{have a dream}}" [...] speech: [...] "I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> together <b>at</b> the table of brotherhood." [...] The quote is useful in connecting the entire African experience {{through the course of}} generations because it relates to a recent figure in black history.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't say so? I {{should like}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and begin <b>at</b> once. But, look here, Blyth, {{when you say}} 'draw from the life,' there can't be the {{smallest}} doubt, of course, about what you mean--but, at the same time, if you would only {{be a little less}} professional in your way of expressing yourself--" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was shown}} into the study, {{and in a}} few minutes Stephen Hurd came in, smoking a pipe, his hands in his pockets. When he saw who his visitor was he stopped short. He did not offer his hand or ask Macheson <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b> He looked <b>at</b> him with a heavy frown upon his face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that a {{parchment}} three-penny {{might give}} me a right <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> yonder table!" [...] said Robin, with a sigh.

6000|$|... "Will {{you please}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> that table and give me, as nearly as you can, {{a sketch of}} the {{position}} of our troops and those of the French, and then explain to me, as far as you may have seen or know, the movements of the corps and the course of events." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} are lucky all round," [...] Ralph said. [...] "An hour ago if any one told us we were going <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> half-past four to a hot dinner of pork and {{potatoes}} we should have slain him as a scoffer.

6000|$|... "I {{told him}} he might," [...] said Marilla wearily. [...] "I thought it would {{keep him out of}} worse mischief. He can only get dirty at that.

5000|$|Lyle's {{house is}} dilapidated. Using two canes, Alvin {{makes his way}} to the door. He calls for his brother.

6000|$|When {{first he}} came to live at my expense, I never thought I {{should be able to}} get him to stop long.

He will be {{snatched}} up to the bright skies in a chariot, that is what will happen to him.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, I {{always have}} my meals by myself. I like these antique customs. I don't {{think that women}} ought <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> table with men. It ruins {{conversation}} and I'm sure it's very bad for them. It puts ideas in their heads, and women are never at ease with themselves when they have ideas." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{understand}} that when the recent disarmament conference met at Washington just as the members were going <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the table Monsieur Briand said to President Harding, [...] "How dry is the United States, anyway?"

60|$|It was Leslie. He wanted Lettie to go {{home with}} him at once. This she refused to do, so he came indoors, and was persuaded <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> table.

6000|$|Miss Annie {{shook her}} head doubtfully. [...] "I should be very glad to have your company," [...] she said, [...] "but I am afraid it will be entirely {{too much of a}} walk for you.
