50|$|A {{knurled nut}} is a nut with a knurled outside surface. This {{facilitates}} tightening by hand (<b>thumb</b> <b>nut)</b> or secures the nut in a substrate (insertion nut).|$|E
50|$|Knurling is {{also used}} on the grips of darts and the footpegs of BMX bicycles. Aside from adding {{functionality}} to an object (valve repairs and hand grips being {{some of the most}} common), knurling also adds a decorative pattern to the material. The knurled nut is one such application, which uses a knurled finish instead of hexagonal or square edges which helps in tightening or loosening the nut without the use of a tool. The knurled surfaces provide enough grip to hold the nut between the thumb and forefinger. Hence it is also called a <b>thumb</b> <b>nut.</b> It is mainly used on small diameter bolts.Knurled nuts are typically used in electrical components, musical instruments and in automobiles.|$|E
50|$|The bevel {{protractor}} {{is used to}} establish and test angles to very close tolerances. It reads to 5 minutes or 1/12° and can measure any angle from 0° to 360°. The {{bevel protractor}} consists of a beam, a graduated dial and a blade which is connected to a swivel plate (with Vernier scale) by <b>thumb</b> <b>nut</b> and clamp. When {{the edges of the}} beam and blade are parallel, a small mark on the swivel plate coincides with the zero line on the graduated dial. To measure an angle between the beam and the blade of 90° or less, the reading may be obtained direct from the graduation number on the dial indicated by the mark on the swivel plate. To measure an angle of over 90°, subtract the number of degrees as indicated on the dial from 180°, as the dial is graduated from opposite zero marks to 90° each way. Since the spaces, both on the main scale and the Vernier scale, are numbered both to the right and to the left from zero, any angle can be measured. The readings can be taken either to the right or to the left, according to the direction in which the zero on the main scale is moved.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can {{you play}} at spang cockle, my lord?" [...] said the Prince, placing a nut {{on the second}} joint of his forefinger, and {{spinning}} it off by a smart application of the <b>thumb.</b> The <b>nut</b> struck on Douglas's broad breast, who burst out into a dreadful exclamation of wrath, inarticulate, but resembling the growl of a lion in depth and sternness of expression.|$|R
