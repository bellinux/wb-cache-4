5|$|Copeland was {{considered}} a prodigy who rose <b>to</b> <b>stardom</b> despite not starting ballet {{until the age of}} 13. By age 15, her mother and ballet teachers, who were serving as her custodial guardians, fought a custody battle over her. Meanwhile, Copeland, who was already an award-winning dancer, was fielding professional offers. The 1998 legal issues involved filings for emancipation by Copeland and restraining orders by her mother. Both sides dropped legal proceedings, and Copeland moved home to begin studying under a new teacher who was a former ABT member.|$|E

5|$|In 1928, Crawford starred {{opposite}} Ramón Novarro in Across to Singapore, {{but it was}} {{her role}} as Diana Medford in Our Dancing Daughters (1928) that catapulted her <b>to</b> <b>stardom.</b> The role established her as a symbol of modern 1920s-style femininity which rivaled Clara Bow, the original It girl, then Hollywood's foremost flapper. A stream of hits followed Our Dancing Daughters, including two more flapper-themed movies, in which Crawford embodied for her legion of fans (many of whom were women) an idealized vision of the free-spirited, all-American girl.|$|E
5|$|McElhenny first rose <b>to</b> <b>stardom</b> as a {{standout}} all-around player for Compton Junior College in 1948. He {{then transferred to}} the University of Washington, {{where he was a}} two-time All-Pacific Coast Conference fullback for the Washington Huskies football team and set several school and conference records. He was drafted by the 49ers with the ninth pick in the 1951 NFL Draft, and his versatility made him an immediate star in the league, earning him five first-team All-Pro honors in his first six seasons. With the 49ers, he was selected for five Pro Bowls, and he earned a sixth Pro Bowl appearance with the Vikings. He finished his career after short stints with the Giants and Lions.|$|E

5|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} {{who was the first}} choice for the role of the itinerant prostitute, Suzy. By some accounts, Rodgers and Hammerstein attempted to get Julie Andrews, only to find that she had just signed a two-year contract to appear in a musical by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, tentatively titled My Lady Liza. Andrews's role, as Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady, would launch her <b>to</b> <b>stardom.</b> Another candidate was Janet Leigh, whom Rodgers admired greatly, but the actress proved to be unavailable. The producers settled on Judy Tyler, auditioned after Rodgers spotted her on television while watching The Howdy Doody Show, in which she appeared as Princess Summerfall Winterspring.|$|E
5|$|Although now 67 {{years old}} and in {{indifferent}} health, Bottomley tried to resurrect his business career. He raised sufficient capital {{to start a new}} magazine, John Blunt, as a rival to John Bull, but the new venture lasted {{little more than a year}} before closing, having lost money from the start. In September 1929 he began an overseas lecture tour, which failed utterly, as did an attempt at a British tour during which he was received with indifference or hostility. By 1930 he was again bankrupt; his wife Eliza died that year, after which Bottomley's former son-in-law Jefferson Cohn evicted him from The Dicker. For the remaining years of his life he lived with his long-time mistress, the actress Peggy Primrose, whom Bottomley, in his years of riches, had vainly tried to promote <b>to</b> <b>stardom.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Hu Die {{declined}} to renew her contract with Tianyi, and {{signed with the}} rival Mingxing (Star) Film Company, led by the shrewd businessman and director Zhang Shichuan, and the talented writer Zheng Zhengqiu. She had a salary of $1,000 a month, a large sum at the time. Her first film with Mingxing was Tower in the White Clouds (1928). She befriended her co-star Ruan Lingyu; the two women would become China's biggest film stars of the 1930s. Her role as Red Girl in the film The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple (1928) propelled her <b>to</b> <b>stardom.</b> The film was such a success that the studio made 17 sequels {{of the same name}} between 1928 and 1931. It started a craze for martial arts films, but also attracted criticism from intellectuals when children neglected their schoolwork to study martial arts or devote themselves to martial arts fiction.|$|E

5|$|Magadheeras success turned Kajal {{into one}} of the most sought-after actresses in Telugu cinema and catapulted her into the foray of leading Telugu actresses. The film was also {{considered}} a fate changer in the career of Ram Charan. The role of Sher Khan played by Srihari was considered as one of the best roles in his career and also catapulted S. S. Rajamouli <b>to</b> <b>stardom.</b> Dev Gill attained stardom with this film and went on to work in several South Indian films as an antagonist. After the release of Magadheera, people began recognising him as Ranadheer. According to writer Gopimohan, Magadheera started a trend of experimentation with period, socio-fantasy and spiritual themes that was continued in films like Panchakshari (2010), Nagavalli (2010), Anaganaga O Dheerudu (2011), Mangala (2011), Sri Rama Rajyam (2011) and Uu Kodathara? Ulikki Padathara? (2012).|$|E
5|$|Sir Ralph David Richardson (19 December 1902– 10 October 1983) was an English actor who, {{along with}} his contemporaries John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier, {{dominated}} the British stage of the mid-20th century. He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played more than sixty cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had had no thought of a stage career until a production of Hamlet in Brighton inspired him to become an actor. He learned his craft in the 1920s with a touring company and later the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. In 1931 he joined the Old Vic, playing mostly Shakespearean roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who had taught him much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him <b>to</b> <b>stardom</b> in the West End and on Broadway.|$|E
5|$|To succeed Davis, the Covent Garden board chose Bernard Haitink, who {{was then}} the musical {{director}} of the Glyndebourne Festival. He was highly regarded for the excellence of his performances, though his repertory was not large. In particular, he was not known as an interpreter of the Italian opera repertoire (he conducted no Puccini and only five Verdi works during his music directorship at Covent Garden). His tenure began well; a cycle of the Mozart Da Ponte operas directed by Johannes Schaaf was a success, and although a Ring cycle with the Russian director Yuri Lyubimov could not be completed, a substitute staging of the cycle directed by Götz Friedrich was well received. Musically and dramatically the company prospered into the 1990s. A 1993 production of Die Meistersinger, conducted by Haitink and starring John Tomlinson, Thomas Allen, Gösta Winbergh and Nancy Gustafson, was widely admired, as was Richard Eyre's 1994 staging of La traviata, conducted by Solti and propelling Angela Gheorghiu <b>to</b> <b>stardom.</b>|$|E

5|$|Dark Angel {{returned}} to Japan on March 4, 2012, {{to take part}} in Io Shirai's fifth anniversary event, which saw her and Shirai defeat Miho Wakizawa and Nanae Takahashi in the main event. A week later, Dark Angel made her debut for World Wonder Ring Stardom, during which she affiliated herself with Io Shirai's Planet stable. In a six-woman tag team match, which celebrated Dark Angel's ten-year anniversary in professional wrestling, she, Shirai and Arisa Hoshiki defeated Eri Susa, Hiroyo Matsumoto and Miho Wakizawa. On July 13, Stardom announced Dark Angel as a participant in the 5★Star GP2012 tournament, which ran from August 19 to September 30. After wins over Saki Kashima, Kairi Hojo and Kyoko Kimura and a loss against Miho Wakizawa, Dark Angel headed to final day of the tournament {{at the top of her}} round-robin block, however, a loss to Natsuki☆Taiyo meant that she missed advancing to the finals of the tournament. In Dark Angel's final match of the tour on October 3, she and Io Shirai wrestled Miho Wakizawa and Nanae Takahashi to a twenty-minute time limit draw. Dark Angel was scheduled to return <b>to</b> <b>Stardom</b> on March 3, 2013, but due to a visa issue, she had to postpone her return until March 10, when she, Io Shirai and Yuzuki Aikawa defeated Act Yasukawa, Natsuki☆Taiyo and Yoshiko in a six-woman tag team main event. On March 24, Dark Angel entered a four-woman tournament to determine the number one contender to the World of Stardom Championship. After defeating Hiroyo Matsumoto in the semi-finals, she was defeated by Io Shirai in the finals. On April 29 at Ryōgoku Cinderella, Dark Angel defeated Act Yasukawa to win the vacant Wonder of Stardom Championship. Dark Angel made her first successful defense of the title on May 19 against Miho Wakizawa. On June 2, she made another successful title defense against Yuhi. Dark Angel returned <b>to</b> <b>Stardom</b> on August 17 to make her third successful title defense against Takumi Iroha. From August 25 to September 23, Dark Angel took part in 5★Star GP2013, where she finished with a record of two wins and three losses, failing to qualify for the finals. On November 4 at Stardom's 100th event, Dark Angel lost the Wonder of Stardom Championship to Act Yasukawa in her fourth title defense.|$|E
