50|$|Yonash was the Chief <b>Tool</b> <b>Engineer,</b> {{in charge}} of the Tooling Department, in the Connersville, Indiana plant of the Aircraft Division of American Central Manufacturing Corporation (AMC) from May 1, 1941 to January 31, 1944. AMC was one of many general {{manufacturing}} companies which switched their focus to subcontracting the production of materiel during World War II. He worked on the tooling for one of the wing sections of the B-24 Liberator Bomber. His department's efforts rated an article in the company newsletter. Photos and drawing of some of the tooling his department produced still survive.|$|E

50|$|Walt W. Braithwaite is a Jamaican born American {{engineer}} and former executive at Boeing. He {{joined the company}} in 1966 as an associate <b>tool</b> <b>engineer</b> in the Fabrication Division. In 1975 he was the senior engineer responsible for developing Boeing's use of computer technology by using CAD/CAM {{in the design of}} commercial airplanes. Over the next several decades Braithwaite's teams oversaw the engineering development of the 707,727,737 and later as head of engineering operations for the 747, 767 programs and the 777, the first commercial aircraft to be designed entirely with computer-aided design. In 1994, Braithwaite was named vice president of all information systems activities for Boeing Commercial Air-plane Group. In 2000 Boeing named Braithwaite President of Boeing Africa, responsible for overseeing corporate activities in the region and acting as an ambassador and liaison between local governments and Boeing divisions in the region. After 36 years with Boeing, Braithwaite retired in 2003 as the highest-ranking black executive in Boeing's history.|$|E
40|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} {{process in which}} a cutting tool, having multiple transverse cutting edges, is pushed or pulled through a hole or surface to remove metal by axial method. Broaching, if properly used, is a highly productive, precise and extremely versatile process. It is capable of production rates as much as 25 times faster than any traditional metal removing methods. Objectives are to {{lower the cost of}} design process by reducing the time required to design and fabricate broach tools which was materialized by the parametric design of the broach, where the design intent of the broach tool geometry is captured. Another objective is to predict the strength characteristics of the broaching tools in the preliminary stage for the <b>tool</b> <b>engineer</b> which was to evaluate the stress characteristic of the broach tool subjected to the cutting conditions. This would be useful for the <b>tool</b> <b>engineer</b> to keep a check on the tool's strength characteristics during every stage of the tools life and also on improving its characteristics during the wear out period. This was achieved by meshing and performing analysis using the Finite Element Modeller package called IIFEM. The model built from the parametric design was utilized to make a finite element model and analysis was performed to predict the stress and deflection in the tool. This would reduce time to design different broaches. By just changing the dimensions and the constraints when required, a new broach can be designed, thus allowing a lot of flexibility in the design. Further the solid model can be used to perform the finite element analysis which would help in knowing the characteristic of the broach tool under various cutting loads. This would also assist in improving the performance of the tool. 1...|$|E

5000|$|SME {{was founded}} in January 1932 {{at the height of}} the Great Depression. Originally named the Society of <b>Tool</b> <b>Engineers,</b> and renamed the American Society of <b>Tool</b> <b>Engineers</b> one year later, it was formed by a group of 33 {{engineers}} and mechanics gathered at the Detroit College of Applied Science. By April of that year, just four months after its beginning, membership increased from the original 33 members to 200 members and continued to grow rapidly with new chapters popping up across the country. As the economic troubles of the 1930s pushed the world ever-closer to war, Society members responded by helping to convert America's industries into the primary military supplier for the Allied war effort, or what President Roosevelt referred to as the [...] "arsenal of democracy." [...] The organization also tailored their educational materials to meet the needs of the defense program and established the Emergency Defense Training Committee. Between 1941 and the end of the war in 1945, Society membership more than doubled, rising from 8,700 to nearly 18,000 members.|$|R
