5|$|Evolution {{also does}} not require that organisms become more complex. Although the history of life shows an {{apparent}} trend towards the evolution of biological complexity; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> if this appearance of increased complexity is real, or if it comes from neglecting {{the fact that the}} majority of life on Earth has always consisted of prokaryotes. In this view, complexity is not a necessary consequence of evolution, but that specific circumstances of evolution on Earth frequently made greater complexity advantageous and thus naturally selected for. Depending on the situation, organisms' complexity can either increase, decrease, or stay the same, and all three of these trends have been observed in evolution.|$|E

According to van Niekerk, [...] "the most enduring lesson for South African medicine was the clarification of the roles of medical practitioners when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of dual responsibilities. This is now embodied inter alia in the SAMA Code of Conduct and in legal interpretations of doctors' responsibilities".|$|E

500|$|Conceptual {{uncertainty}} is the [...] "most fundamental in {{the validity of}} a trust or power", and is where the language used in the trust is unclear. Examples include where familiar but overly vague terms are used, such as [...] "good customers" [...] or [...] "useful employees"; if the concept cannot be certain, the trust fails. Evidential uncertainty, on the other hand, is where <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of fact {{it is impossible to}} answer, such as when a claimant cannot prove he is a beneficiary.

500|$|Like {{all other}} {{territorial}} claims in Antarctica, the Norwegian claim of Queen Maud Land (along with its claim of Peter I Island) {{is subject to}} the Antarctic Treaty System. The treaty makes clear that Antarctica can only be used for peaceful purposes and assures the freedom of scientific activity. It promotes international scientific cooperation and bans any nuclear-related activities. Although territorial claims are not invalidated by the treaty, all claims under Article III of the treaty are in effect suspended {{as long as it is}} in force. Norway, Australia, France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have all mutually recognised each other's claims in Antarctica. But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> on the actual boundaries of the claim, since the initial Norwegian demarcations both towards the South Pole and into the sea were left unclear. [...] Apparently this was to avoid accepting use of the [...] "sector principle" [...] for Arctic Ocean claims by the Soviet Union. [...] However, in 2015 the Norwegian Parliament specified that its national claim extended to the Pole. [...] Since, as noted above, Article III of the Antarctic Treaty specifically states that, [...] "No new claim, or enlargement of an existing claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica shall be asserted while the present Treaty is in force", this leaves the matter uncertain.|$|E

2500|$|During Shacharit, {{there are}} two blessing before the Shema and one thereafter. These numbers, two before and one after, {{are based on the}} Mishnah Tractate Berachos, Chapter 11, which states: [...] "In the morning one blesses two before and one after," [...] though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> in Jewish law as to whether one recites these blessing on the Shema, or {{surrounding}} the Shema. The conclusion that has been drawn is that they are to be blessing surrounding the Shema, because the structure {{is similar to that of}} blessings of the Torah, and there is doubt as to whether such blessings would actually enhance the Shema.|$|E
2500|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{response in}} the Pliocene was {{in the direction of}} bulk-feeding. Massive grazers, such as Elasmotherium, maximally hypsodont, moved across vast ranges consuming C4 grass in bulk. While the horses and other more nearly modern grazers could rely on galloping for mobility in any circumstance, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> as to what degree the brachypodial giants can be said to be [...] "cursorial". Elephants, for example, must keep one foot on the ground, where true gallopers are entirely off it for brief intervals. The horns and impenetrable body armour insured that the giants would not be required to gallop away from any predator. At least until the arrival of man, they were, as the legends relate, lords of the savanna.|$|E
2500|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> {{about how}} to pluralize acronyms. Often a writer will add an 's' {{following}} an apostrophe, as in [...] "PC's". However, Kate Turabian, writing about style in academic writings, allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms [...] "only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters". Turabian would therefore prefer [...] "DVDs" [...] and [...] "URLs" [...] and [...] "Ph.D.'s". The Modern Language Association and American Psychological Association prohibit apostrophes from being used to pluralize acronyms regardless of periods (so [...] "compact discs" [...] would be [...] "CDs" [...] or [...] "C.D.s"), whereas the New York Times style guide requires an apostrophe when pluralizing all abbreviations regardless of periods (preferring [...] "PC's, TV's and VCR's").|$|E

2500|$|Also <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> {{about how}} {{separate}} {{from the idea of}} -genes birth and begetting the cited uses of monogenes in the sense of [...] "unique" [...] truly are. For example, the ending -genes is arguably not redundant even in the sense of [...] "only" [...] as per when Clement of Rome (96 AD), and later Origen, Cyril and others, employ monogenes to describe the rebirth of the phoenix. At issue is whether Clement is merely stressing monos unique, or using monogenes to indicate unique in its method of rebirth, or possibly {{that there is only one}} single bird born and reborn. Likewise in Plato's Timaeus, the [...] "only-begotten and created Heaven", is still unique in how it is begotten, in comparison to the begetting of animals and men, just as Earth and Heaven give birth to Ocean and Tethys. Of the Liddell Scott references for [...] "unique" [...] (monogenes being used purely as monos) that leaves only Parmenides, which (as above) is no longer considered a likely reading of the Greek text.|$|E
2500|$|In the Talmud {{the origin}} of the temple of Onias is narrated with legendary additions, there being two {{versions}} of the account. Here also Onias is mentioned as the son of Simon, and that Isaiah's prophecy is referred to. In regard to the Law the temple of Onias (Beit Honio, or [...] "House of Onias", handed down in the name of Saadia Gaon as Beit Honi) was looked upon as forbidden, though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> as to whether idolatry was done there or not. The possibility of the priests of Onias being admitted to officiate at Jerusalem was explicitly stated, while one passage even expresses the view that sacrificial worship was permissible in the temple of Onias, however, this view was rejected, and is based on the view that idolatry was not performed there. The opinion was prevalent among the Rabbis that the temple of Onias was situated at Alexandria—an error that is repeated by all the chroniclers of the Middle Ages. This temple is also sometimes confounded with the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim.|$|E
2500|$|The Rex Cinema is {{regarded}} by some, including the Daily Telegraph, as Britain's most beautiful cinema. Described by Dame Judi Dench as [...] "absolutely awe-inspiring", in 2014, the Rex was declared Britain's Best Cinema in the inaugural Guardian film awards. Built in 1937 the Rex is recognised by English Heritage {{as a fine}} example of a 1930s art deco cinema. The cinema was designed by architect David Evelyn Nye for the Shipman and King circuit. Closed in 1988, the cinema was extensively restored in 2004 and has become a thriving independent local cinema. The Rex frequently has sold-out houses for evening showings, the cinema is a [...] "movie palace with all the original art deco trimmings" [...] (its interior features decorations of sea waves and shells). Inside is a step [...] "back into the golden age of film" [...] when going to the movies was an experience; the cinema features luxurious seating and two licensed bars. It is managed by its owner James Hannaway, who introduces films.

2500|$|By {{the time}} the Pilgrim Fathers landed in the Mayflower at Plymouth Rock in 1620, French Canadians had already {{explored}} Muskoka and Haliburton and had established relations with the Indians on Georgian Bay of the Great Lake Huron, even further west of Muskoka. Indeed, before England took over New France, French were dealing with the Ojibwa. [...] But {{the matter of the}} Rice Lake and in general Mississauga Ojibwa is complicated because the Mohawks invaded southern Ontario in the mid-1600s and pushed the original Huron settlements, and any Algonquian (Ojibwa) friends north up the Trent Severn valley. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of whether the Mississaugas originated on the north shore of Lake Huron, or whether they were originally the Ojibwa of the major north lake Ontario rivers who were driven out in the mid-1600s along with their friends the Hurons, and returned in the late 1600s to reclaim their original territories from the Mohawk nations who had settled there. (All those settlements vanished by 1700, and what remained in all areas were the Mississaugas.) This is the relevance of the French information, but its relationship to Paudash Lake is quite indirect and this entire paragraph is going somewhat off the subject of Paudash Lake.|$|E
