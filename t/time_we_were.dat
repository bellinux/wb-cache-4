5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E

25|$|I {{just want}} to say that when I was 16 or 17 years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him… and he looked at me. And I just have some kind of feeling that he was – I don’t know how or why – but I know he was with us all the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> making this record in some kind of way.|$|E

500|$|I was {{the only}} one who asked for a rise, and Gilbert was furious with me. [...] All the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> rehearsing [...] he never spoke to me, and only {{acknowledged}} my existence by sometimes saying sneeringly: 'Make way for the High-Salaried Artiste!' ...Passing storms like this did occasionally ruffle the course of our friendship, but on the whole it flowed on deep and strong.|$|E
500|$|The first {{screenplay}} Griffith wrote was Cardula, a Dracula-themed story {{involving a}} vampire music critic. After Corman rejected the idea, Griffith says {{he wrote a}} screenplay titled Gluttony, in which the protagonist was [...] "a salad chef in a restaurant who would wind up cooking customers and stuff like that, you know? We couldn’t do that though because of the code at the time. So I said, “How about a man-eating plant?”, and Roger said, “Okay.” By that <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> both drunk." ...|$|E

They took ration packs that had been intended for the transcontinental crossing, biscuits, Bovril, sugar and dried milk. They also took two 18-gallon casks of water (one of which was damaged during the loading and let in sea water), two Primus stoves, paraffin, oil, candles, sleeping bags and odd items of spare clothing.|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox side-by-side, with a PC version initially described as [...] "possible". Creative director Emmanuel Valdez said that [...] "for the longest <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> debating {{whether or not to}} bring it out for GameCube," [...] before deciding [...] "there's just not a lot there in the GameCube market right now." [...] There were also plans to port the game for the PlayStation Portable. The game engine for Darkwatch features middleware engines RenderWare, Havok and Quazal, while Autodesk MotionBuilder was used to create character animation and motion capture.|$|E
500|$|Following their Edinburgh Fringe shows, {{the group}} enjoyed {{considerable}} {{success in the}} United Kingdom, making appearances on numerous BBC comedy shows. In 1988, the group was nominated for the Perrier Comedy Award for their performances at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Fidler says that the British people were more receptive to their act at the time than Australians had been. [...] "The whole thing exploded for us when we got there, it was quite incredible. Within a very short <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing national television appearances in front {{of millions of people}} and playing these enormous shows," [...] he says. They played extensively in Canada, Germany, America and Britain, and finished their time in Britain by appearing on the final episode of the successful Friday Night Live. However, despite the acclaim they were receiving overseas, when they returned to Australia at the end of 1988 they remained unknown. Upon arriving in Melbourne, they struggled to gain a following and went back to busking on the streets.|$|E
500|$|Baynham {{told the}} Guardian that [...] "despite {{the fact that}} people say he's awful, a lot of the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> trying to build empathy: you're {{watching}} a man suffer but also at some level identifying with his pain." [...] Felicity Montagu, who plays Partridge's assistant Lynn, felt he was a good person [...] "deep down" [...] and actually [...] "vulnerable and lovable". Iannucci said that Partridge stays optimistic because he never sees himself as others see him, and that despite his failings was [...] "the perfect broadcaster for these times, when there are 24 hours to fill and dead time is a crime – he has a unique capacity to fill any vacuum with his own verbal vacuum." [...] Rob and Neil Gibbons felt that by the time of Mid Morning Matters, when Partridge is working for an even smaller radio station, he was more at peace with himself and that his lack of self-awareness saved him from misery.|$|E

500|$|In April 2014, Cameron {{expected}} {{to finish the}} three scripts within six weeks, stating that all three sequels would be in production simultaneously and were still slated for December 2016 to 2018 releases. He stated that although Friedman, Jaffa and Silver, and Salerno are each co-writing one sequel with him, they at first all worked together on all three scripts: [...] "I didn't assign each writer which film {{they were going to}} work on until the last day. I knew if I assigned them their scripts ahead of time, they'd tune out every <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> talking about the other movie." [...] "We... worked out every beat of the story across all three films so it all connects as one, sort of, three-film saga." [...] Cameron also stated that Weaver would be featured in all three sequels and that her character Grace Augustine would be alive. In March 2015, however, Weaver said that she will play a new character in the next film.|$|E
500|$|Starr's first {{recording}} session as {{a member}} of the Beatles took place on 4 September 1962. He stated that Martin had thought that he [...] "was crazy and couldn't play ... because I was trying to play the percussion and the drums at the same <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> just a four piece band". For their second recording session with Starr, which took place on 11 September 1962, Martin replaced him with session drummer Andy White while recording takes for what would be the two sides of the Beatles' first single, [...] "Love Me Do", backed with [...] "P.S. I Love You". Starr played tambourine on [...] "Love Me Do" [...] and maracas on [...] "P.S. I Love You". Concerned about his status in the Beatles, he thought: [...] "That's the end, they're doing a Pete Best on me." [...] Martin later clarified: [...] "I simply didn't know what Ringo was like and I wasn't prepared to take any risks." ...|$|E
500|$|The Coens have {{acknowledged}} several cinematic inspirations for Barton Fink. Chief {{among these are}} three movies by Polish-French filmmaker Roman Polanski: Repulsion (1965), Cul-de-Sac (1966), and The Tenant (1976). These movies employ a mood of psychological uncertainty coupled with eerie environments that compound the mental instability of the characters. Barton's isolation in his room at the Hotel Earle is frequently {{compared to that of}} Trelkovsky in his apartment in The Tenant. Ethan said regarding the genre of Barton Fink: [...] "t is kind of a Polanski movie. It is closer to that than anything else." [...] By coincidence, Polanski {{was the head of the}} jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 1991, where Barton Fink premiered. This created an awkward situation. [...] "Obviously", Joel Coen said later, [...] "we have been influenced by his films, but at this <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> very hesitant to speak to him about it because we did not want to give the impression we were sucking up".|$|E

500|$|Aspinall later commented {{about his}} first meeting with George Harrison, who also {{attended}} the Liverpool Institute: [...] "My first encounter with George was behind the school’s air-raid shelters. [...] This great mass of shaggy hair loomed up and an out-of-breath voice requested a quick drag of my Woodbine. It {{was one of the first}} cigarettes either of us had smoked. We spluttered our way through it bravely but gleefully. After that the three of us did lots of ridiculous things together.... By the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> ready to take the GCE exams we added John Lennon to our 'Mad Lad' gang. He was doing his first term at Liverpool College of Art which overlooks the Liverpool Institute playground and we all got together in a students coffee bar at lunchtime." [...] Aspinall took nine GCEs at the Institute and passed eight of them, but failed the French exam. He left school in July 1959, and studied accountancy. [...] Aspinall worked for a Liverpool company for two years, receiving a wage of £2-10s–0d. (£2.50 decimal equivalent) per week as a trainee accountant.|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} was not close, it was 7–2 on the principal {{issue of whether}} {{there had been a}} constitutional violation... But what if it was unconstitutional to have that recount? You're going to let it continue and come to a conclusion? And then overturn it? The reason to stop it sooner was not, [...] "Ooh, we're worried that it's going to come out the wrong way"... you forget what was going on at the <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> <b>were</b> the laughingstock of the world. The world's greatest democracy that couldn't conduct an election. We didn't know who our next president was going to be. The lengthy transition that has become standard when you change from one president to another could not begin because you didn't know who the new president was going to be. It was becoming a very serious problem. The issue before the United States Supreme Court is: having decided the case, having decided this is unconstitutional, should we nonetheless let the election go on? Or is it time cut it off and let's move on? ...|$|E
500|$|... "New Slang" [...] {{achieved}} {{a new level}} of cultural significance when it was prominently featured in the film Garden State (2004). In a scene from the film, Sam (portrayed by Natalie Portman) tells Andrew Largeman (played by director Zach Braff) that the song [...] "will change your life." [...] The song [...] "changed everything" [...] for the group, leading their first two albums to sell more than twice what they had prior to the film's debut. [...] "Almost overnight, the Shins became indie-rock icons," [...] wrote Robert Levine of Spin. The band extended their tour in support of the song and its popularity. [...] "We saw a change in our audience. By the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> done touring for Chutes Too Narrow, there was this new interest," [...] said Mercer. [...] "We toured again almost as the soundtrack to that movie, and colleges were all of a sudden interested in us playing on their campuses. We wanted to consummate the new relationship by touring and having a relationship with them. I mean, it just kept growing!" [...] This additional exposure helped Oh, Inverted World move 500,000 units in the United States.|$|E

500|$|The idea {{of using}} [...] "Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight" [...] {{originated}} when an anonymous sent Hillenburg a tape with [...] "a bunch of music." [...] While the writers were developing the show outside Nickelodeon, Hillenburg played the song for Drymon {{as an example of}} the enthusiasm he was looking for. When it came time to write the pilot, they had the idea to use the song in the third act. The crew eventually got the rights to use the song for the pilot, but all they had was [...] "the crummy copy on Steve's old tape." [...] The writers were able to use the music, as one of the women who worked at Nickelodeon at the time [...] "knew somebody somewhere who had access to something," [...] and she brought in a copy of the song on CD. Drymon said [...] "We were totally lucky that she had the contact, otherwise we wouldn't have been able to use it. The sad part was Tiny Tim died right around the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> writing the pilot, so he never knew we used his song." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically True Blue was a {{different}} direction for Madonna. Her previous efforts had her singing in a high pitched voice. With this album, Madonna toned it down for a more bubblegum-pop voice. The songs on the album reflect this {{and a number of}} instruments were used in the songs to bring out the different moods which the lyrics emphasized. [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] features acoustic, electric, and rhythm guitars, keyboards, and string arrangements. The song samples Beethoven's Appassionata sonata. A continuous percussion filled structure was used in [...] "Open Your Heart". [...] "White Heat" [...] sampling of the film's quotation was included with speech and gunshots. It is an uptempo dance song with synth bass and double-tracked vocals supported by male voices in the chorus. [...] "I don't write dance music and I don't see it as contributing to the cultural growth of the world," [...] grumbled Pat Leonard in 1992. [...] "At the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing the groove stuff on the True Blue album, it was semi-innovative. There wasn't a precedent that made you gag. God forbid that I might have contributed to the mess we're in now." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming {{took place}} on and near the frozen Gullfoss {{waterfall}} near Reykjavík. Feeling it was a dangerous process, McCulloch said in 1993, [...] "If we had slipped there wasn't anything for hundreds of feet below us." [...] In 2001 Griffin said, [...] " [...] the sun barely appeared the whole <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> there. To walk, stand up, or just think seemed a massive effort." [...] Despite the danger the filming proved its worth when the British music magazine Q said in 2001, [...] "The Porcupine cover {{is the epitome of}} rock band as heroic archetype– young men on some ill-defined but glorious mission, one easily as timeless as the stars and the sea." [...] The filming was finished in December 1982 with the band performing songs from the album at their rehearsal room at The Ministry. Butt interspersed this with clips from the 1929 Russian documentary The Man With the Movie Camera and he also projected psychedelic watercolour effects onto the band. A VHS video was subsequently released by Castle Hendring in 1983 called Porcupine– An Atlas Adventure which contained the six music videos– [...] "In Bluer Skies", [...] "The Cutter", [...] "My White Devil", [...] "Porcupine", [...] "Heads Will Roll" [...] and [...] "The Back of Love".|$|E
