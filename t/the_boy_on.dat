The stone reportedly fell through banana leaves before striking <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>on</b> the head, causing little to no pain, as it was small enough to have been slowed by both friction with the atmosphere as well as that with banana leaves, before striking the boy.|$|E
25|$|The cup is etched and pitted due to {{the effect}} of {{corrosive}} cleaning deposits; however, remnants of silver chloride and black silver sulphide survive in crevices. A crack runs from the rim, around the figure of <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>on</b> one side. The base is distorted and broken with the pedestal having been pushed up, denting the cup and causing the cup to lean at an angle. The damage to the base was in modern times, thought to have occurred when the cup was cleaned in the 20th century. The foot was soldered back on to the cup in modern times. It is thought that the cup was moulded twice in modern times due to remains of plaster and silicone rubber found in crevices.|$|E

The felony complaint stated that Jackson had, on seven occasions, [...] "willfully, unlawfully, and lewdly committed a lewd and lascivious act upon, and with, the boy's body and certain parts and members thereof, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, and gratifying the lust, passions, and sexual desires" [...] of Jackson and the boy and that this sexual conduct had been [...] "substantial"; also that, on two of these occasions, Jackson had administered to the boy an intoxicating agent with intent thereby to enable and assist himself to carry out the aforementioned act. Jackson denied these allegations and said that the sleepovers were nonsexual. While he described <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>on</b> whose statements the accusations were based as [...] "a sweet child," [...] he maintained that the boy was manipulated by greedy parents.|$|E

By calling the album War we're giving people {{a slap in the face}} and at the same time getting away from the cosy image a lot of people have of U2." [...] The Edge said that [...] "It's a heavy title. It's blunt. It's not {{something}} that's safe, so it could backfire. It's the sort of subject matter that people can really take a dislike to. But we wanted to take a more dangerous course, fly a bit closer to the wind, so I think the title is appropriate." [...] <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>on</b> the cover is Peter Rowen (brother of Bono's friend, Guggi). He also appears on the covers of Boy, Three, The Best of 1980–1990, Early Demos and many singles. Bono described the reasoning behind the cover: [...] "Instead of putting tanks and guns on the cover, we've put a child's face. War can also be a mental thing, an emotional thing between loves. It doesn't have to be a physical thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{importance}} of the lectures was not in teaching complex mathematics or physics, but rather in demonstrating to the wider public the principles of physics and encouraging discussion and debate. Generally, individuals presenting the lectures did not adhere to any particular brand of physics, but rather demonstrated a combination of different theories. New advancements {{in the study of}} electricity offered viewers demonstrations that drew far more inspiration among the laity than scientific papers could hold. An example of a popular demonstration used by Jean-Antoine Nollet and other lecturers was the ‘electrified boy’. In the demonstration, a young boy would be suspended from the ceiling, horizontal to the floor, with silk chords. An electrical machine would then be used to electrify the boy. Essentially becoming a magnet, he would then attract a collection of items scattered about him by the lecturer. Sometimes a young girl would be called from the auditors to touch or kiss <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>on</b> the cheek, causing sparks to shoot between the two children in what was dubbed the ‘electric kiss‘. Such marvels would certainly have entertained the audience, but the demonstration of physical principles also served an educational purpose. One 18th-century lecturer insisted on the utility of his demonstrations, stating that they were “useful for the good of society.” ...|$|E
