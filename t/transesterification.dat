40|$|Various bi- and polifunctional hydroxyalkanethiols were chemospecifically acylated to O-acylesters by lipase-catalyzed <b>transesterifications</b> {{in organic}} media. In addition, hydroxyalkanethiols with two {{hydroxyl}} groups exhibited regiospecificity or regioselectivity, {{depending on the}} nature of both the substrate and the lipase. As the chain length of the α,ω-hydroxyalkanethiol increased, the reaction was limited to smaller acyl moieties. Experimental conditions under which enzymatic acylations were carried out and their results are presented and discussed.

40|$|AbstractTwo {{strategies}} {{based on}} the use of subsets for calculating the enantioselectivity in lipase-catalyzed <b>transesterifications</b> using the CHARMM force field were investigated. Molecular dynamics was used in our search for low energy conformations. Molecular mechanics was used for refining these low energy conformations. A tetrahedral intermediate with a rigid central part was used for mimicking the transition state. The energy differences between the transition states of the diastereomeric enzyme-substrate complexes were calculated. The way of defining the subsets was based on two fundamentally different strategies. The first strategy used predefined parts of the enzyme and the substrate as subsets. The second approach formed energy-based subsets, varying in size with the substrates studied. The selection of residues to be included in these energy-based subsets was {{based on the}} energy of the interaction between the specific residue or water molecule and the transition state. The reaction studied was the kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols in <b>transesterifications</b> using the Candida antarctica lipase B as chiral biocatalyst.

40|$|International audienceLipase-catalyzed <b>transesterifications</b> {{were carried}} out without solvent and in mild {{conditions}} on permethylated β-cyclodextrins derivatives to obtain lipidyl-cyclodextrin, {{a new class of}} amphiphilic compounds with expected auto-assembly properties.

30|$|A novel {{protocol}} for the D-aminoacylase catalyzed double Michael addition {{was developed by}} Chen et al. [69]. The reactions, which {{were used for the}} synthesis of (hetero)spiro[5.5] undecane derivatives produced the cis isomers in all the cases. Grulich et al. [70] provide a useful summary of the applications of Penicillin G acylases which are known to catalyse <b>transesterifications,</b> Markonikov additions or Henry reactions. Unfortunately, the catalytic efficiency reported so far in these promiscuous reactions is far from satisfactory for any biotechnological applications. However, as Nobeli et al. [11] had pointed out, such results lay the foundation of subsequent efforts using protein engineering/ directed evolution to improve upon these catalytic activities. Large number of successful results which prove this are already available in the literature [12],[71]-[73].|$|R

25|$|For the {{manufacture}} of biodiesel, sodium hydroxide {{is used as a}} catalyst for the <b>transesterification</b> of methanol and triglycerides.

25|$|Water {{contamination}} is also {{a potential}} problem when using certain chemical catalysts involved in the production process, substantially reducing catalytic efficiency of base (high pH) catalysts such as potassium hydroxide.

In the Handbuch der biochemischen Arbeitsmethoden (1912-1913), Zemplén wrote about the production and detection of glucosides as well as other, higher carbohydrates.

Racemic lavandulol from a commercial source, was also resolved using several enzymatic <b>transesterifications</b> followed by hydrolysis with PPL.

25|$|Chemically, transesterified {{biodiesel}} comprises {{a mix of}} mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids. The {{most common}} form uses methanol (converted to sodium methoxide) to produce methyl esters (commonly referred to as Fatty Acid Methyl Ester – FAME) {{as it is the}} cheapest alcohol available, though ethanol can be used to produce an ethyl ester (commonly referred to as Fatty Acid Ethyl Ester – FAEE) biodiesel and higher alcohols such as isopropanol and butanol have also been used. Using alcohols of higher molecular weights improves the cold flow properties of the resulting ester, at the cost of a less efficient <b>transesterification</b> reaction. A lipid <b>transesterification</b> production process is used to convert the base oil to the desired esters. Any free fatty acids (FFAs) in the base oil are either converted to soap and removed from the process, or they are esterified (yielding more biodiesel) using an acidic catalyst. After this processing, unlike straight vegetable oil, biodiesel has combustion properties very similar to those of petroleum diesel, and can replace it in most current uses.|$|E
25|$|Methanol is the {{simplest}} alcohol, being only a methyl group {{linked to a}} hydroxyl group. It is a light, volatile, colorless, flammable liquid with a distinctive odor {{very similar to that}} of ethanol (drinking alcohol). However, unlike ethanol, methanol is highly toxic and unfit for consumption. At room temperature, it is a polar liquid. It is used as an antifreeze, solvent, fuel, and as a denaturant for ethanol. It is also used for producing biodiesel by <b>transesterification</b> reaction.|$|E
25|$|Conversion of {{vegetable}} oil to biodiesel is via a <b>transesterification</b> reaction, where the triglyceride {{is converted to}} the methyl ester plus glycerol. This is usually done using methanol and caustic or acid catalysts, but can be achieved using supercritical methanol without a catalyst. The method of using supercritical methanol for biodiesel production was first studied by Saka and his coworkers. This {{has the advantage of}} allowing a greater range and water content of feedstocks (in particular, used cooking oil), the product {{does not need to be}} washed to remove catalyst, and is easier to design as a continuous process.|$|E
5000|$|Antimycins are {{produced}} as secondary metabolites by Streptomyces bacteria, a soil bacteria. These specialized metabolites likely function to kill neighboring organisms {{in order to}} provide the streptomyces bacteria with a competitive edge. Antimycins {{are produced}} by a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)/polyketide synthase (PKS) assembly complex which acts as an assembly line for antimycin production. The assembly is genetically coded for by the ant gene family. The assembly requires 14 proteins, AntBCDEFGHIJKLMNO, which shuttle the intermediates along the assembly line through a series of <b>transesterifications,</b> keto reductions, thiolations (addition of a sulfur containing group), condensations, and adenylations.

40|$|Polymerization of gamma-butyrolactone {{has been}} studied in toluene with Al(OiPr) 3 as an initiator. The {{ring-opening}} polyaddition proceeds through a coordination-insertion mechanism at a very low rate. Well defined -isopropylester, -hydroxy poly(-butyrolactone) s (PBL) are formed with a narrow molecular weight distribution at low monomer-to-initiator molar ratios, When this ratio is higher (ca. 170), a competition occurs between propagation and side reactions, i. e. elimination, inter- and intra-molecular <b>transesterifications</b> and thermal degradation, {{which is responsible for}} a loss of control of the PBL molecular charcteristics. The addition of a Lewis base (1 equivalent of nicotine/Al) to the Al-alkoxide initiator has no significant effect on the polymerization rate, although the chain microstructure is deeply affected since predominantly syndiotactic PBL chains are formed (63 % syndio-diads) in contrast to a completely atactic polymer in the absence of nicotine.

40|$|The Holliday junction, a key {{intermediate}} in both homologous and site-specific recombination, {{is generated}} by the reciprocal exchange of single strands between two DNA duplexes. Resolution of the junctions can occur in two directions with respect to flanking markers, either restoring the parental DNA configuration or generating a genetic crossover. Recombination can be regulated, in principle, by factors that influence the directionality of the resolution step. We demonstrate that the vaccinia virus DNA topoisomerase, a eukaryotic type I enzyme, catalyzes resolution of synthetic Holliday junctions in vitro. The mechanism entails concerted <b>transesterifications</b> at two recognition sites, 5 '-CCCTT decreases, that are opposed within a partially mobile four-way junction. Cruciforms are resolved unidirectionally and with high efficiency into two linear duplexes. These findings suggest a model whereby type I topoisomerases may either promote or suppress genetic recombination in vivo...|$|R
