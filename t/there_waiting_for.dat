A pair of identical tables, lamps and chairs are <b>there</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> them, stage left and stage right. The set is therefore symmetrical. The name Croker is an obvious pun on the euphemism, ‘to croak’ i.e. to die, and a name to which Beckett has shown some attachment.|$|E
500|$|Following the Volume 4 world tour, Black Sabbath {{returned}} to Los Angeles {{to begin work}} on their next release. Pleased with the Volume 4 album, the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and {{returned to}} the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles. With new musical innovations of the era, the band were surprised to find that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a [...] "giant synthesiser". The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973, but in part because of substance issues and fatigue, they were unable to complete any songs. [...] "Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on Volume 4 and we really got discontent" [...] Iommi said. [...] "Everybody was sitting <b>there</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> me to come up with something. I just couldn't think of anything. And if I didn't come up with anything, nobody would do anything." ...|$|E
500|$|As Russell concluded, {{to strong}} applause from gold delegates, {{there was a}} buzz of {{anticipation}} as Bryan ascended to the podium. There was loud cheering as Bryan stood <b>there,</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> his audience to calm. Bryan's lecture tours had left him a well-known spokesman for silver. As yet, {{no one at the}} convention had effectively spoken for that cause, which was paramount to the delegates. According to political scientist Richard F. Bensel in his study of the 1896 Democratic convention, [...] "Although the silver men knew they would win this fight, they nonetheless needed someone to tell them—and the gold men—why they must enshrine silver {{at the heart of the}} platform." [...] Bensel noted, [...] "The pump was more than primed, it was ready to explode." [...] Bryan would say little that he had not said before—the text is similar to that of a speech he had given the previous week at Crete, Nebraska—but he would give the convention its voice.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2008, Steven Blank, a {{professor}} of strategic studies at the U.S. Army War College, said that [...] "This is a war that Russia wanted, and clearly had planned for." [...] "The evidence I’ve seen indicates that the Russian Army was sitting <b>there</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> this, that this was essentially a provocation launched by the South Ossetians, who ratcheted up {{the level of violence}} in order to bring the Georgians -- who are easily provokable, obviously -- to attack," [...] he said.

[...] They then rode south to Thomas Peel's where they were joined by Mr Peel and two others. [...] On {{the morning of}} 27 October, ten soldiers of the 21st Regiment, two corporals and eight privates, arrived at Peel's homestead to join the party. [...] Ammunition was issued to a party on 27 October 1834, and they were issued with several weeks' supplies, as the soldiers were to remain at Pinjarra and establish the planned garrison there. [...] Leaving Peel's farm they crossed the Serpentine River and went forward to the Murray delta where tracks of a sizable group of Aboriginal men women and children were discovered heading towards Pinjarra. [...] In the late afternoon, they camped at Jinjanuk, 10 miles {{from the mouth of the}} Murray River, so that they could begin the attack early next morning when they judged the Aboriginal group would be least prepared.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "experimental", featuring elements of techno music along with metal. [...] "What Lurks on Channel X?" [...] is yet another interlude, which much like the previous track makes use of techno elements; the song's samples have been described as the [...] "forefront" [...] of the track. The line [...] "thirteen acres of hell" [...] is taken from The Last House on the Left (1972). [...] "Ladies and gentleman, I would like to make the following statement", along with the lines [...] "the young generation, that sick generation" [...] and [...] "impressionable young people, brutal honesty will be shown on this screen" [...] are all taken from The Undertaker and His Pals (1966). [...] "Return of the Phantom Stranger" [...] was described as [...] "more atmospheric than most, building up tension and a sense of foreboding." [...] Zombie's vocals on the song were compared to that of Marilyn Manson. [...] "Return of the Phantom Stranger" [...] features the quote [...] "she lays <b>there,</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the sacrifice" [...] from the film The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973). Hellbilly Deluxe closes with the final song, [...] "The Beginning of the End".

2500|$|Jordan Pundik later accounted, [...] "I'm not {{comparing}} my band to the Beatles whatsoever, {{but their}} [...] records were simple songs {{about love and}} relationships, and people could relate to their songs because they understood what {{they were trying to}} say. That's what this record reminds me of. There's not weird metaphors. It's just straight up, wearing your heart on your sleeve." [...] Steve Klein emphasised the shift in mood from their previous album by stating, [...] "I think every record we make we try and capture a time period. When writing the songs for Coming Home it was more positive than negative. I felt on the last record, Catalyst, we were very negative lyrically. You can tell that by the titles [...] "All Downhill From Here" [...] and [...] "This Disaster," [...] it was a heavier record. Coming Home on the other hand takes you to a different place. It’s the record I feel we’ve been waiting our whole career to do, taking everything people love about NFG and bringing it to the next level." [...] Bassist Ian Grushka further explained, [...] "We only really talk about personal things that have affected us first-hand, our songs are about emotions rather than some political agenda." [...] The song, [...] "When I Die" [...] was written by Gilbert about the death of his father. When initially writing the bridge section for the song, Gilbert found the experience emotionally draining and had to leave the studio in order to compose himself. Despite this, he maintains that while song is [...] "sad", it remains [...] "a good sad." [...] He reflected this in the album's liner notes by adding, [...] "It is a song about accepting death and finding the bright side of the situation. I'm no longer afraid to die because I have my father <b>there</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> me on the other side." ...|$|E
