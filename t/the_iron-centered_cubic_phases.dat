The relationship between the lipid nanomaterial and the encapsulated protein, however, remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of incorporating the five transmembrane and lipo-proteins which make up the β-barrel assembly machinery from Gram-negative bacteria within a series of bicontinuous <b>cubic</b> <b>phases.</b> The transmembrane β-barrel BamA caused an increase in lattice parameter of the <b>cubic</b> <b>phase</b> upon encapsulation.

Despite the biological significance of these proteins, the atomic reso 1 utio:n structures of membrane proteins are being solved at a much slower rate than their soluble counterparts. This is primarily due to difficulties that arise in maintaining the lipid interactions required to retain the structural and functional integrity of the proteins during structural studies. One: approach to resolving this problem would be to develop alternative membrane-mimetic environments for structural studies of membrane proteins. The <b>cubic</b> <b>phases</b> formed by mixtures of lipids and water have been identified as such an environment.

This application of <b>cubic</b> <b>phases,</b> along with information provided from previous studies, indicated that <b>cubic</b> <b>phases</b> possessed the necessary properties to make them ideal membrane-mimetic environments for solution NMR studies of membrane proteins. I investigated the suitability of the <b>cubic</b> <b>phases</b> formed by mixtures of monoolein and water as membrane-mimetic environments for the solution NMR study of incorporated membrane proteins. For my studies I used two transmembrane peptides (WNALAAVMAAVA&AAGKSKSKS and alamethicin), and one membrane surface-associating peptide (methionine-enkephalin), as models of membrane proteins. In the NMR spectra collected on the transmembrane peptides, only the residues found in the interfacial regions of the <b>cubic</b> <b>phase</b> were observed, whereas all of the residues of the membrane surface-associating peptide were observed.
