25|$|Script Pro {{manufactures}} a robot {{designed to}} help pharmacies fill prescriptions that consist of oral solids or medications in pill form. The pharmacist or pharmacy technician enters the prescription information into its information system. The system, upon determining {{whether or not the}} drug is in the robot, will send the information to the robot for filling. The robot has 3 different size vials to fill determined {{by the size of the}} pill. The robot technician, user, or pharmacist determines the needed size of the vial based on the tablet when the robot is stocked. Once the vial is filled it is brought up to a conveyor belt that delivers it to a holder that spins the vial and attaches the patient label. Afterwards it is set on another conveyor that delivers the patient's medication vial to a slot labeled with the patient's name on an LED read out. The pharmacist or technician then checks the contents of the vial to ensure it's the correct drug for the correct patient and then seals the vials and sends it out front to be picked up. The robot is a very <b>time</b> <b>efficient</b> device that the pharmacy depends on to fill prescriptions.|$|E
