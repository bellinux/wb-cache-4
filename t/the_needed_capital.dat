500|$|In November 1989, Bynoe and Bertram Lee {{purchased}} the Denver Nuggets. Lee and Bynoe had worked together in Boston years earlier, and Bynoe thought of Lee as a mentor. [...] They had kept in touch, and {{were involved in}} several real estate dealings together. But the Nuggets deal was problematic from the start. [...] In fact, it almost fell through because Lee {{did not have the}} resources everyone, Bynoe among them, thought he had. [...] Media reports depicted Lee as a wealthy and successful businessman who was a financier with offices in two cities, and formerly part owner of Boston's WNEV-TV. [...] But Lee and Bynoe were unable to meet the deadline to purchase the team from then-owner Sidney Shlenker. [...] It would later be revealed that Lee had problems raising <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> <b>capital.</b> [...] It was Bynoe, with the assistance of David Stern, Jay Pritzker, and Jerrold Wexler, who salvaged the transaction over the course of six months. The mainstream media reported that Lee and Bynoe were now the first two blacks to own a major sports team, but several of the black newspapers pointed out that the two men were actually managing general partners rather than owners, because the revised agreement to purchase the team meant they owned only a 37.5% stake in the team. Bynoe sold his interest in the franchise in August 1992. Communications Satellite Corporation's (COMSAT) Video Enterprises subsidiary put up 62.5% of the $65 million needed to purchase the Nuggets.|$|E

2500|$|The {{unregulated}} {{growth of}} small rural banking institutions can be partially {{attributed to the}} rising cost of agriculture especially in the Corn Belt and Cotton Belt. Throughout the corn and cotton belts real estate increases drove the demand for more local funding to continue to supply rising agricultural economics. The rural banking structures would supply <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> <b>capital</b> to meet the farm commodity market, however, this came with a price of reliability and low risk lending. Economic growth was promising during the period of 1887-1920 with an on average of 6 percent growth in [...] In particular the participation in World War I (1917-1918) drove a booming agricultural market that drove optimism at the consumer and lending level, which in turn, resulted in a laxer approach in the lending process. Overbanked conditions existed which pressured struggling banking locations to increase their services (specifically to the agricultural customers) without any additional regulatory oversight or qualifications. This dilemma introduced several high risk and marginal business returns to the banking market. Banking growth would continue through the first two decades well outside of previous trends disregarding the current economic and population standards. Banking profitability and loan standards begin to deteriorate as early as 1900 as a result; adding to the agriculture shock and Great Depression to follow.|$|E

2500|$|John Burrows is {{recognized}} as the founder of Montoursville. He was born near Rahway, New Jersey. In his youth Burrows delivered mail on horseback, riding between New York and Philadelphia. He {{also served as a}} courier for General George Washington during the American Revolution for fourteen months. Following the war, Burrows migrated to Muncy and worked in the distilling business for several years. His work at the distilleries enabled him to build up <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> <b>capital</b> to make an investment in some land near the mouth of Loyalsock Creek, what is now Montoursville. Burrows also gained a measure of political clout in Lycoming County, serving first as a justice of the peace before being elected to the county commissioner's post in 1802, and later to the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1808. He bought [...] in 1812. Burrows divided his land into lots in 1820 and sold them for $50.00 each. The first buyers of lots in Montoursville divided themselves into two distinct ethnic groups. The Germans settled in the eastern end in a neighborhood that became known as Coffeetown, while the English settled in the western neighborhood, known as Teatown. In addition to selling the lots in Montoursville, Burrows operated a highly successful farm. His produce was sent by raft down the Susquehanna River and on to Baltimore, where he was able to turn a profit. Burrows used these profits to further his enterprise by building the first gristmill in the town. He continued to sell lots until {{the time of his death}} in 1837.|$|E

50|$|Attracting {{capital was}} a {{continuing}} {{problem for the}} company. Available records do not indicate that at any time more than 70-80% of the authorized shares were subscribed or that more than £6000 (out of an authorized £10000) was raised in this way. A limited amount of money came from canal operations (tolls) but {{for the bulk of}} <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> <b>capital</b> other sources were required.

50|$|As {{early as}} 1865 a branch railway to Moniaive was proposed: the G&SWR paid {{two-thirds of the}} cost of a survey. In 1867 a {{determined}} effort was made to start construction. The cost of a line connecting Moniaive to the G&SWR was estimated at £66,000, but local promoters only managed to get commitment to £20,150 in subscriptions. They approached the G&SWR with a request to subscribe the difference, but the G&SWR took the view that any advantages would come to the inhabitants themselves, and it was for them to put up the money. The scheme came to nothing. A further scheme was proposed in 1872, the Glencairn Railway from Auldgirth to Moniaive; this scheme obtained Parliamentary authorisation, but was unable to raise <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> <b>capital.</b> Another unsuccessful proposal followed in 1879.|$|E
50|$|In Rowe's {{third year}} he {{focused more on}} equipment, river rafting, and mountaineering. His central {{location}} in Quepos had three uncrowded rivers ideal for rafting. Running day trips on the river helped him build <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> <b>capital</b> and marketing funds to establish a school for running courses more relevant to his philosophical approach to instructing. Rather than running quick commercial trips, he started leading trips whose objectives were to learn through adventure. He founded Save the Rainforest Expeditions School (STRES) to provide an avenue to work with youth applying the same philosophies as he used at COBS. STRES claimed to focus on teaching self-reliance, leadership, compassion, and service in a Costa Rican environment: Outward Bound principles were taught through rainforest adventures and service projects geared toward rainforest conservation as well as indigenous village assistance.|$|E
50|$|After a year {{of service}} {{for one of the}} two groups, an {{opportunity}} of prosperity presents itself: The dwarf brothers Bartrand and Varric Tethras are planning a treasure hunting expedition into the perilous region of the Deep Roads, taking advantage of the Fifth Blight's recent end and the consequent reduction of Darkspawn in the Deep Roads. The expedition is expected to be extremely risky but very rewarding. Bartrand refuses to hire any more warriors; Varric, however, reveals that they desperately lack enough funding and knowledge of the region. Therefore, he approaches Hawke and proposes a partnership in exchange for the fulfillment of the two requirements. As such, Hawke embarks on an adventurous quest to earn <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> <b>capital</b> and enlist the aid of Anders, a rogue mage and former Grey Warden who possesses the knowledge they need about The Deep Roads.|$|E

50|$|By November 1877, Tucson {{was quickly}} growing and {{developments}} {{such as the}} railroads reaching Yuma and Ed Schieffelin's discovery of silver at Tombstone promised to accelerate the trend. The brothers decided to invest their resources and found a bank operating separately from their mercantile business, but were initially unable to raise <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> <b>capital.</b> They eventually partnered with Pinckney R. Tully, E. B. Gage, and others to open the Pima County Bank on January 2, 1879. While Phillip William Smith was elected the bank's first president, Jacobs was named as cashier and placed {{in charge of the}} bank's day-to-day operations. A rival bank, established by Anson P. K.

Despite concerns that Tucson lacked the resources to support two banks, both establishments thrived for several years.In January 1880, Jacobs turned over his position as cashier to his brother Barron. With the growing demand imposed upon them by being bankers, the Jacobs brothers ended operation of their mercantile business in February 1880.|$|E
50|$|In 1910, the Methodists hired a New York {{fundraising}} firm {{to raise}} funds for a new, larger church to replace the 1883 building. The growing congregation raised $14,000 and neighbor C. J. Wagenbreth donated <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> <b>capital</b> to complete the project, providing that no bell be hung in the belfry. Wagenbreth, not wanting to be awoken by bells, offered this deal, a steeple but no bells. Designed by the architectural firm of Woodruff & McGulpin in 1912, the Methodist Church stands as a visual reminder of the growth of Miles City and is an important neighborhood anchor. The building exhibits eclectic architectural influences, including Romanesque Revival windows, crenellated Gothic battlements, and early Christian or Tudor massing. Decorative round-arched Romanesque openings complement the bell tower and the design carries over to the main level windows. Each opening is highlighted with painted wood mullions and cusps that form a pair of arches with circular openings surrounded by brick. The only structure in Miles City designed by the firm, the design bears similarities to Brynjulf Rivenes’ Presbyterian Church on Main Street.|$|E
5000|$|Per Rostow {{there are}} three main {{requirements}} for take-off:1. The rate of productive investment should rise from approximately 5% to over 10% of national income or net national product2. The development {{of one or more}} substantial manufacturing sectors, with a high rate of growth;3. The existence or quick emergence of a political, social and institutional framework which exploits the impulses to expansion in the modern sector and the potential external economy effects of the take-off. The third requirement implies that <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> <b>capital</b> must be mobilized from domestic resources and steered into the economy, rather than into domestic or state consumption.Industrialization becomes a crucial phenomenon as it helps to prepare the basic structure for structural changes on a massive scale.
