5|$|Since {{little of}} Honora Sneyd's own words have survived, our {{image of her}} is largely {{through the eyes of}} others, in {{particular}} Anna Seward and Richard Edgeworth. Honora Sneyd is often listed amongst the members or associates of the Bluestockings, educated upper class literary women who disdained traditional female accomplishments and often formed close female friendships. The depiction of the effect of consumption on her {{has been used as a}} symbol of <b>the</b> <b>pervasiveness</b> <b>of</b> the disease in eighteenth century culture. The work she started on educational psychology would prove to be immensely influential throughout the nineteenth century. Her name is also inextricably entwined with that of Anna Seward in the literature of lesbian relationships and female friendship.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after {{acquiring}} Taiwan in 1895, then Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi {{ordered that}} opium {{should be banned}} in Taiwan as soon as possible. However, due to <b>the</b> <b>pervasiveness</b> <b>of</b> opium addiction in Taiwanese society at the time, and {{the social and economic}} problems caused by complete prohibition, the initial hard line policy was relaxed in a few years. On January 21, 1897, the Colonial Government issued the Taiwan Opium Edict mandating a government monopoly of the opium trade, and restricting the sale of opium to those with government issued permits, with the ultimate goal of total abolition. The number of opium addicts in Taiwan quickly dropped from millions to 169,064 in 1900 (6.3% of the total population at the time), to 45,832 (1.3% of the population) by 1921. However, the numbers were still higher than those in nations where opium was completely prohibited. It was generally believed that one important factor behind the Colonial Government's reluctance to completely ban opium was the potential profit to be made through a state run narcotics monopoly.|$|E

500|$|According to The Sunday Mail a 2004 {{newspaper}} report {{notes that}} [...] "no worries" [...] {{has begun to}} be used in American English. Writing in a 2004 article for The Advertiser, Samela Harris comments: [...] "The Americans have no idea of the etymology of 'no worries'. So, while they may cheerily adopt our 'no worries' mantra, 'no worries' will never catch on as an attitude." [...] According to Tom Dalzell, author of two books on slang usage in the United States, linguistics experts are not certain how the expression became popular in that country. Usage of the term by Steve Irwin on The Crocodile Hunter, as well as attempts by members of the American press to imitate the expression during the 2000 Sydney Olympics, have been put forth as theories explaining <b>the</b> <b>pervasiveness</b> <b>of</b> the expression in the United States. Linguistics professor Kate Burridge writes in her 2004 book Weeds In the Garden Of Words that expressions including [...] "no worries", [...] "absolutely", and [...] "bottom line" [...] have become less prevalent in favor of newer sayings.

500|$|Annie Hall {{has been}} cited as a film which uses both therapy and {{analysis}} for comic effect. Sam B. Girgus considers Annie Hall to be a story about memory and retrospection, which [...] "dramatizes a return via narrative desire to the repressed and the unconscious {{in a manner similar}} to psychoanalysis". He argues that the film constitutes a self-conscious assertion of how narrative desire and humor interact in the film to reform ideas and perceptions and that Allen's deployment of Freudian concepts and humor forms a [...] "pattern of skepticism toward surface meaning that compels further interpretation". Girgus believes that proof of <b>the</b> <b>pervasiveness</b> <b>of</b> Sigmund Freud in the film is demonstrated at the beginning through a reference to a joke in Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious, and makes another joke about a psychiatrist and patient, which Girgus argues is also symbolic of the dynamic between humor and the unconscious in the film. Further Freudian concepts are later addressed in the film with Annie's recall of a dream to her psychoanalyst in which Frank Sinatra is smothering her with a pillow, which alludes to Freud's belief in dreams as [...] "visual representations of words or ideas".|$|E
500|$|Steven Soderbergh was {{motivated}} {{to make an}} [...] "ultra-realistic" [...] film about the public health and scientific response to a pandemic. The movie touches {{on a variety of}} themes, including the factors which drive mass panic and collapse of social order, the scientific process for characterizing and containing a novel pathogen, balancing personal motives against professional responsibilities and rules {{in the face of an}} existential threat, the limitations and consequences of public health responses, and <b>the</b> <b>pervasiveness</b> <b>of</b> interpersonal connections which can serve as vectors to spread disease. Soderbergh acknowledged the salience of these post-apocalyptic themes is heightened by reactions to the September11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina. The movie was intended to realistically convey the [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "unnerving" [...] social and scientific reactions to a pandemic. The recent real-life epidemics such as the 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2009 flu pandemic have been inspirations and influences in the film. The chain of contagion involving bats and pigs is reminiscent of the trail of the Nipah virus that originated in Malaysia in 1997, which similarly involved the disturbance of a bat colony by deforestation.|$|E

Add to that the fact that I'm supposed to somehow 'belong' to that celebrity group—and I really don't feel like I do in a lot of ways—and you can see how the topic started to become really interesting to me. The Glorious Excess (BORN) show was my way of diving into those topics, trying to find answers.
