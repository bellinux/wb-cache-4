5|$|Hilbert spaces arise {{naturally}} {{and frequently}} {{in mathematics and}} physics, typically as infinite-dimensional function spaces. The earliest Hilbert spaces were studied from <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century by David Hilbert, Erhard Schmidt, and Frigyes Riesz. They are indispensable tools in the theories of partial differential equations, quantum mechanics, Fourier analysis (which includes applications to signal processing and heat transfer)—and ergodic theory, which forms the mathematical underpinning of thermodynamics. John von Neumann coined the term Hilbert space for the abstract concept that underlies many of these diverse applications. The success of Hilbert space methods ushered in a very fruitful era for functional analysis. Apart from the classical Euclidean spaces, examples of Hilbert spaces include spaces of square-integrable functions, spaces of sequences, Sobolev spaces consisting of generalized functions, and Hardy spaces of holomorphic functions.|$|E
5|$|International {{emergency}} medicine is a subspecialty of {{emergency medicine}} that focuses {{not only on}} the global practice of emergency medicine but also on efforts to promote the growth of emergency care as a branch of medicine throughout the world. The term international emergency medicine generally refers to the transfer of skills and knowledgeincluding knowledge of ambulance operations and other aspects of prehospital carefrom developed emergency medical systems (EMSs) to those systems which are less developed. However, this definition has been criticized as oxymoronic, given the international nature of medicine and the number of physicians working internationally. From <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> international emergency medicine is better described as the training required for and the reality of practicing the specialty outside of one's native country.|$|E
5|$|What {{all these}} {{different}} varieties of functionalism share in common is the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is, functionalism abstracts away from {{the details of the}} physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental functional properties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. From <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> it does not really matter whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.|$|E

Since he does not know how the car is hidden nor how the host makes choices, he may be able to make use of his first choice opportunity, as it were to neutralize the actions of the team running the quiz show, including the host.|$|E

It investigates how the global significance of the whole meaning can be interpreted as a structural reality of the linguistic manifestation. The technical-artistic as well as the ermeneutic aspects within the research about semantic fields are concerned. Therefore¸ on one hand, the analysis concerns the single semantic fields/sense areas in order to discover the linguistic Weltansicht; on the other hand, the text construction as well as the sense core of poetic sequence are interpreted. From <b>this</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> the text comprehension means comprehension of the way the linguistic process is organized, through which text and poem owe their origin...|$|R

In quantum field theory infinities arise which need to be interpreted {{in such a way as}} to lead to a physically meaningful result, a process called renormalization.|$|E
