5|$|Outside of India, golden jackals in <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus</b> and Turkey {{indicate}} the next highest genetic diversity, while those in Europe indicate low genetic diversity, which confirms their more recent expansion into Europe. Genetic data {{indicates that the}} golden jackals of the Peloponnese Peninsula in Greece and the Dalmatian coast in Croatia may represent two ancient populations that have survived into modern times. Golden jackals in the Balkans originated from those expanding from southeast Europe and from <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus.</b> Golden jackals from both the Balkans and <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus</b> are expanding into the Baltic. In the Middle East, golden jackals from Israel have a higher genetic diversity than European jackals. This {{is thought to be}} due to Israeli jackals having hybridized with dogs, gray wolves, and African golden wolves, creating a hybrid zone in Israel.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{considerable}} losses, {{in early}} 1942 Germany {{and its allies}} stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year. In May the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch Peninsula and at Kharkov, and then launched their main summer offensive against southern Russia in June 1942, to seize the oil fields of <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus</b> and occupy Kuban steppe, while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The Germans split Army Group South into two groups: Army Group A advanced to the lower Don River and struck south-east to <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus,</b> while Army Group B headed towards the Volga River. The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad on the Volga.|$|E

5|$|Relations {{between the}} two powers {{remained}} relatively quiet until {{the early years of}} the 8th century, by which time the stage for a new round of conflict was set: by this time, Byzantine political authority had been marginalized in <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus,</b> and the Caliphate tightened its grip on Armenia after the suppression of a large-scale rebellion in 705. With Armenia annexed into the Caliphate, the Arabs and the Khazars faced each other for control of <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus.</b> Only the western parts of Transcaucasia, comprising modern Georgia, remained free from direct control by either of the two rival powers. War broke out in 713/714, when the Umayyad general Maslama, a son of the Caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705), conquered Derbent. Maslama then drove deeper into Khazar territory, trying, without success, to subdue the Huns living north of <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus</b> (who were Khazar vassals). The Khazars opposed him under the general Alp', but also launched raids to the south into Albania in response. In 717, the Khazars raided in force into Adharbayjan, but they were driven back by the Arabs under Hatin ibn al-Nu'man.|$|E
5|$|The 737 {{campaign}} {{marked the}} end of large-scale warfare between the two powers, establishing Derbent as the northernmost Muslim outpost and securing Muslim dominance over Transcaucasia. At the same time, the long wars weakened the Umayyad army and contributed to the eventual fall of the dynasty to the Abbasid Revolution a few years later. Relations between the Muslims of <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus</b> and the Khazars remained largely peaceful thereafter, apart from two Khazar raids in the 760s and in 799, resulting from failed efforts to secure a alliance through marriage between the Arab governors or local princes of <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus</b> and the Khazar khagan. Occasional warfare continued in the region between the Khazars and the local Muslim principalities of <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus</b> until the collapse of the Khazar state in the late 10th century, but the great wars of the 8th century were never repeated.|$|E
5|$|The Z-3 {{was to be}} a {{reconnaissance}} {{version and}} would have had additional fuel tanks, increasing its range to 6,000km (3,730mi). Production was due to take place in 1944, just as bomber production was being abandoned. The long-range variants failed to come to fruition. The He 111Z was to have been used in an invasion of Malta in 1942 and as part of an airborne assault on the Soviet cities of Astrakhan and Baku in <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus</b> in the same year. During the Battle of Stalingrad their use was cancelled due to insufficient airfield capacity. Later in 1943, He111Zs helped evacuate German equipment and personnel from <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus</b> region, and during the Allied invasion of Sicily, attempted to deliver reinforcements to the island.|$|E

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I in July 1914 between Russia, France and Britain {{on one side and}} Germany, the Ottoman Empire and Austria on the other, Andranik left Bulgaria for Russia.

5|$|After the February 1917 {{revolution}} that toppled the Tsarist government, Mikoyan and other Bolsheviks fought against anti-Bolshevik elements in <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus.</b> Mikoyan became a commissar {{in the newly}} formed Red Army and continued to fight in Baku against anti-Bolshevik forces. He {{was wounded in the}} fighting and was noted for saving the life of fellow Party-member Sergo Ordzhonikidze. Afterwards, he continued his Party work, becoming one of the co-founders of the Baku Soviet, which lasted until 1918, when he and twenty-five other commissars fled Baku and were captured by the Transcaspian Government. Known as the Baku 26, all the commissars were executed with the sole exception of Mikoyan; the circumstances of his survival are shrouded in mystery. In February 1919 Mikoyan returned to Baku and resumed his activities there, helping to establish the Baku Bureau of <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus</b> Regional Committee (Kraikom).|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{collapse}} of the Russian Empire in 1917, the Armenian, Georgian, and Muslim leaders of <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus</b> united to create the Transcaucasian Federation in the winter of 1918.

5|$|Both {{ships of}} the class were {{stationed}} in Crete after they entered service, to assist in stabilizing the island {{in the aftermath of}} the Cretan Revolt of 18661869. Nevertheless, the Ottoman fleet remained largely inactive during this period.

They were primarily occupied with bombarding Russian coastal positions in support of the Ottoman army in <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus.</b> They also supported an amphibious assault on the port of Sokhumi in May 1877. For the rest of the war, Muin-i Zafer was stationed in Sulina at the mouth of the Danube, while Avnillah assisted in the defense of Batumi in <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus.</b> After the war, both vessels were laid up in Constantinople, and they received a minor refit in 1882.|$|E
