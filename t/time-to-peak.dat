We investigated the sensitivity of perfusion CT studies using parametric <b>time-to-peak</b> maps to assess ischemic brain tissue with respect to early infarct signs on native CT scans. METHODS: First-pass, single-section perfusion CT was performed in 20 patients who pre-sented with symptoms of acute stroke within 6 hours of onset. Initial CT perfusion studies were compared with follow-up studies within 30 hours in 10 patients. A manual, region of interest (ROI) -based, local evaluation procedure was performed to determine delayed <b>time-to-peak</b> values and diminished peak amplitudes. In addition, <b>time-to-peak</b> parameter maps were processed off-line from the dynamic CT data sets to identify areas of perfusion deficits, which were expressed as hemispheric lesion areas (HLAs).

BackgroundRecent studies have shown detrimental effects of RV pacing, possibly related to the induction of LV dyssynchrony. MethodsFifty-eight patients treated with His bundle ablation and pacemaker implantation were studied. To assess the effect of RV pacing on <b>time-to-peak</b> radial strain of different LV segments, we applied speckle-tracking analysis to standard LV short-axis images. In addition, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, LV volumes, and systolic function were assessed at baseline and after long-term RV pacing. ResultsAt baseline, similar <b>time-to-peak</b> strain for the 6 segments was observed (mean 371 ± 114 ms). In contrast, after a mean of 3. 8 ± 2. 0 years of RV pacing, there was a marked heterogeneity in <b>time-to-peak</b> strain of the 6 segments. In 33 patients (57 %), LV dyssynchrony, represented by a time difference ≥ 130 ms between the <b>time-to-peak</b> strain of the (antero) septal and the posterolateral segments, was present. In these patients, a deterioration of LV systolic function and NYHA functional class was observed. In 11 patients, an “upgrade” of the conventional pacemaker to a biventricular pacemaker resulted in partial reversal of the detrimental effects of RV pacing. ConclusionsSpeckle-tracking analysis revealed that permanent RV pacing induced heterogeneity in <b>time-to-peak</b> strain, resulting in LV dyssynchrony in 57 % of patients, associated with deterioration of LV systolic function and NYHA functional class.

40|$|We have {{measured}} {{the sensitivity of}} rod photoreceptors from overnight-dark–adapted Xenopus laevis through developmental stages 46 – 66 into adulthood by using suction-pipette recording. The dark current increased gradually from ∼ 5 pA at stage 46 to ∼ 20 pA at stage 57, compared with an adult (metamorphosed) current of ∼ 35 pA. This increase in dark current largely paralleled the progressive increase in length and diameter of the rod outer segment (ROS). Throughout stages 46 – 66, the dark current increased approximately linearly with ROS surface area. At stage 53, there was a steep (∼ 10 -fold) increase in the rod flash sensitivity, accompanied by a steep increase in the <b>time-to-peak</b> of the half-saturated flash response. This covariance of sensitivity and <b>time-to-peak</b> suggested {{a change in the}} state of adaptation of rods at stage 53 and thereafter. When the isolated retina was preincubated with 11 -cis-retinal, the flash sensitivity and the response <b>time-to-peak</b> of rods before stage 53 became similar to those at or after stage 53, suggesting that the presence of free opsin (i. e., visual pigment without chromophore) in rods before stage 53 was responsible for the adapted state (low sensitivity and short <b>time-to-peak).</b> By comparing the response sensitivity before stage 53 to the sensitivity at/after stage 53 measured from rods that had been subjected to various known bleaches, we estimated that 22 – 28 % of rod opsin in stage 50 – 52 tadpoles (i. e., before stage 53) was devoid of chromophore despite overnight dark-adaptation. When continuously dark adapted for 7 d or longer, however, even tadpoles before stage 53 yielded rods with similar flash sensitivity and response <b>time-to-peak</b> as those of later-stage animals. In conclusion, it appears that chromophore regeneration is very slow in tadpoles before stage 53, but this regeneration becomes much more efficient at stage 53. A similar delay in the maturity of chromophore regeneration may partially underlie the low sensitivity of rods observed in newborn mammals, including human infants...|$|E

Methods and Results—Ten open chest dogs had routine grayscale and tissue Doppler images of the mid-left ventricular (LV) short-axis plane. Electrical activation was altered by pacing from right ventricular (RV), LV free wall, and biventricular sites to create various degree of mechanical dyssynchrony and alter regional function.

The purpose of this study is to determine if an 8 -week eccentric training regimen in conjunction with an athlete’s offseason training program can produce a significant decrease in the <b>time-to-peak</b> EMG activation of the hamstring muscle group during a functional landing task. A total of 38 female intercollegiate athletes participated in this study. All subjects were pre-tested for hamstring muscle activation (<b>time-to-peak</b> EMG) in a functional landing task. The experimental group (ECCT) completed an 8 -week training cycle performing two eccentric exercises in addition to their normal training regimen. The control group (CONT) performed their normal off-season training routine. At the completion of the training cycle both ECCT and CONT completed post tests for average <b>time-to-peak</b> EMG activation.

40|$|Synchronous {{contraction}} {{and relaxation}} of the myocardium {{is required to}} optimize cardiac function. Regional timing of contraction and relaxation is dyssynchronous in many patients with heart failure. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a highly successful treatment for dyssynchronous heart failure. Patients are currently selected for CRT using surface electrocardiogram QRS duration {{as a measure of}} dyssynchrony. However, up to 30 % of patients selected for CRT show no improvement. This poor response rate may in part be explained by the poor correlation between mechanical dyssynchrony and QRS duration. Thus, better methods to quantify mechanical dyssynchrony in the heart may improve the poor CRT response rate. The overall goal of this project was to develop better methods to diagnose dyssynchrony in the left ventricle (LV). We developed two new methods with different approaches. The first method improved upon existing tissue-Doppler based echocardiographic diagnosis of dyssynchrony by utilizing a cross-correlation (XC) function to quantify dyssynchrony during post-processing as opposed to the quantitatively simplistic <b>time-to-peak</b> analysis that is currently utilized. The second method utilized standard cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images to quantify the dyssynchrony in the flow of blood within the LV, which may represent a more direct, physiologically relevant measure of dyssynchrony. Specific aim 1 demonstrated that the new XC delay parameters can be quantified accurately with a stationary region of interest and therefore require significantly less post-processing time to calculate compared to the <b>time-to-peak</b> dyssynchrony parameters. Specific aim 2 showed that XC delays are superior to existing <b>time-to-peak</b> dyssynchrony parameters at discriminating patients with LV dyssynchrony from those with normal function. The <b>time-to-peak</b> parameters showed dyssynchrony in approximately half of the normal, healthy volunteers while the XC delay parameters had nearly perfect diagnostic accuracy. The results of specific aim 3 showed that XC delays could diagnose acute, pacing-induced dyssynchrony in young, healthy children with 79 % accuracy while the <b>time-to-peak</b> parameters showed accuracies of 71 %, 57 % and 57 %.

40|$|Presynaptic {{facilitation}} of transmitter {{release from}} Aplysia sensory neurons {{is an important}} contributor to behavioral sensitization of the gill and siphon withdrawal reflex. The enhanced release is accompanied by reduction of the serotonin-sensitive S current in the sensory neurons and a consequent increase in duration of the presynaptic action potential (ranging from 10 % to 30 %). We find that changes of similar magnitude in the duration of depolarizing voltage-clamp steps in sensory neurons in intact abdominal ganglia yield increases in synaptic potentials of 45 - 120 %. In dissociated cell culture, these changes lead to increases of 25 - 60 % in the synaptic potential. Prolongation of presynaptic depolarization using voltage clamp or prolongation of {{the duration of the}} action potential by K+-channel blockers leads to prolongation of the <b>time-to-peak</b> of the synaptic potentials; similar changes in <b>time-to-peak</b> occur during presynaptic facilitation. The <b>time-to-peak</b> is not changed by homosynaptic depression or by changing the Ca 2 + concentration, procedures that alter release without changing the duration of the action potential. Preventing the spike from broadening by voltage clamping the presynaptic neuron substantially reduces or blocks the facilitation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: CSPAMM tagging sequence {{with separate}} tag-line preparation in two orthogonal directions was applied on 10 healthy volunteers {{in combination with}} HARP for tissue displacement mapping. RESULTS: Important features of brain dynamics, such as caudal displacement amplitude and the <b>time-to-peak</b> of the pulse wave were derived for six regions in the brain. Peak displacement values amounted to 0. 18 +/- 0. 02 mm, 0. 10 +/- 0. 01 mm, 0. 09 +/- 0. 02 mm, and 0. 04 +/- 0. 01 mm for regions in the pons, cerebellum, corpus callosum (splenium), and frontal lobe, respectively. Displacement values of the pons differed significantly from all other regions measured. With the additional information of the <b>time-to-peak</b> measure all six regions except the corpus callosum (splenium) and cerebellum can be distinguished. The values found suggest that the pulse wave travels from the brain stem first occipitally {{and then to the}} frontal lobe, where peak values appear later and are significantly attenuated.

40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: An {{artificial}} {{neural network}} (ANN) -based segmentation method was developed for dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the breast and compared with quantitative and empiric parameter mapping techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population was composed of 10 patients with seven malignant and three benign lesions undergoing dynamic MR imaging of the breast. All lesions were biopsied or surgically excised, and examined by means of histopathology. A T 1 -weighted 3 D FLASH (fast low angle shot sequence) was acquired before and seven times after the intravenous administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine at a dose of 0. 1 mmol/kg body weight. Motion artifacts on MR images were eliminated by voxel-based affine and nonrigid registration techniques. A two-layered feed-forward back-propagation network was created for pixel-by-pixel classification of signal intensity-time curves into benign/malignant tissue types. ANN output was statistically compared with percent-enhancement (E), signal enhancement ratio (SER), <b>time-to-peak,</b> subtracted signal intensity (SUB), pharmacokinetic parameter rate constant (k(ep)), and correlation coefficient to a predefined reference washout curve. RESULTS: ANN was successfully applied to the classification of breast MR images identifying structures with benign or malignant enhancement kinetics. Correlation coefficient (logistic regression, odds ratio [OR] = 12. 9; 95 % CI: 7. 7 - 21. 8), k(ep) (OR = 1. 8; 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 2. 6), and <b>time-to-peak</b> (OR = 0. 45; 95 % CI: 0. 3 - 0. 7) were independently associated to ANN output classes.

A recent development, referred to as tissue synchronisation imaging, colour codes TDI <b>time-to-peak</b> systolic velocities of segments and displays mechanical asynchrony. Furthermore, real-time 3 D echocardiography provides new regional information about mechanical asynchrony. Contained in an LV model and projected on a bull's eye plot, this modality helps to display the spatial distribution of mechanical asynchrony. Finally, segmental <b>time-to-peak</b> circumferential strain curves, produced by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, provide additional quantification of LV mechanical asynchrony. Effects of LBBB on regional and global cardiac function are impressive, myocardial involvement seems to play a role {{and with the help of}} these novel imaging modalities, new insights continue to develop...|$|E
40|$|The {{understanding}} of the neuronal firing input to the motor neurons innervating oculomotor muscles is vital in studying control of eye-movements. The firing rate of the motor neurons which causes rapid eye movements called saccades has been characterized here using a Gaussian function. Using experimental horizontal saccade data, {{the parameters of the}} Gaussian function are estimated by least square minimization. These parameters, peak firing rate and <b>time-to-peak</b> of the input firing rate were observed to be functions of the saccade amplitude. Their relationship is quantified using a least square curve fit. The peak firing rate is found to be linearly varying with saccade amplitude and <b>time-to-peak</b> varies as a quadratic function of saccade amplitude. The model can predict the input firing rate of motor neurons for all saccade amplitudes independent of the availability of data. This work provides a method that can be extended for predicting the neural firing rates to be generated by the motor neurons at the oculomotor muscles for producing different classes of eye movements...|$|E
40|$|Agonist {{activation}} of the hP 2 Y 1 receptor expressed in Xenopus oocytes stimulated an endogenous voltage-gated ion channel, previously identified as the transient inward (Tin) channel. When human P 2 Y 1 (hP 2 Y 1) and skate P 2 Y (sP 2 Y) receptors were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, <b>time-to-peak</b> values (a measure of the response to membrane hyperpolarization) of the Tin channel were significantly reduced compared to oocytes expressing the hB 1 -bradykinin receptor or the rat M 1 -muscarinic (rM 1) receptor. Differences in activation were also observed in the Tin currents elicited by various P 2 Y receptor subtypes. The <b>time-to-peak</b> values of the Tin channel in oocytes expressing the hP 2 Y 4, hP 2 Y 11, or hB 1 -bradykinin receptors were similar, whereas the channel had significantly shorter <b>time-to-peak</b> values in oocytes expressing either the hP 2 Y 1 or sP 2 Y receptor. Amino acid substitutions at His- 132, located in the third transmembrane domain (TM 3) of the hP 2 Y 1 receptor, delayed the onset of channel opening, but not the kinetics of the activation process. In addition, Zn 2 + sensitivity was also dependent on the subtype of P 2 Y receptor expressed. Replacement of His- 132 in the hP 2 Y 1 receptor with either Ala or Phe increased Zn 2 + sensitivity of the Tin current. In contrast, truncation of the C-terminal region of the hP 2 Y 1 receptor had no affect on activation or Zn 2 + sensitivity of the Tin channel. These results suggested that TM 3 in the hP 2 Y 1 receptor was involved in modulating ion channel function and blocker pharmacology of the Tin channel...|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of {{magnetic}} resonance imaging analysis, based on fusion of three-dimensional reconstructions of <b>time-to-peak</b> parametric maps and high-resolution T 1 -weighted images, is proposed in order to evaluate the perfusion of selected volumes of interest. Because in recent years a wealth of data have suggested the crucial involvement of vascular alterations in mental diseases, we tested our new method on a restricted sample of schizophrenic patients and matched healthy controls. The perfusion of the whole brain was {{compared with that of}} the caudate nucleus by means of intrasubject analysis. As expected, owing to the encephalic vascular pattern, a significantly lower <b>time-to-peak</b> was observed in the caudate nucleus than in the whole brain in all healthy controls, indicating that the suggested method has enough sensitivity to detect subtle perfusion changes even in small volumes of interest. Interestingly, a less uniform pattern was observed in the schizophrenic patients. The latter finding needs to be replicated in an adequate number of subjects. In summary, the three-dimensional analysis method we propose {{has been shown to be}} a feasible tool for revealing subtle vascular changes both in normal subjects and in pathological conditions...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. To {{find the}} <b>time-to-peak</b> for {{creatine}} kinase MBmass (CKMB) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) after acute reperfusion, to compare peak and cumulative values to estimate infarct size (IS), and to evaluate clinical routine sampling for assessment of IS. Design. Acute primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) {{was performed in}} 38 patients with first-time myocardial infarction. In 21 patients, CKMB and cTnT were acquired before PCI and at 1. 5, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 48 hours thereafter. In 17 patients, clinical routine samples were acquired at arrival, and at 10 and 20 h. IS was assessed by delayed contrast-enhanced MRI (DE- MRI). Results. <b>Time-to-peak</b> was 7. 6 +/- 3. 6 h for CKMB and 8. 1 +/- 3. 4 h for cTnT. Peak values correlated strongly to cumulative values (r(s) = 0. 97 - 0. 98) {{as well as to}} DE-MRI (r(s) = 0. 8 - 0. 82). Clinical routine sampling showed lower r(s) values (0. 47 - 0. 60). Conclusions. Peak values are likely captured if CKMB and cTnT are acquired at 3, 6, and 12 h after acute PCI. These peak values can be used to estimate myocardial infarct size after acute PCI...|$|E
40|$|White noise {{techniques}} {{have been used}} widely to investigate sensory systems in both vertebrates and invertebrates. White noise stimuli are powerful {{in their ability to}} rapidly generate data that help the experimenter decipher the spatio-temporal dynamics of neural and behavioral responses. One type of white noise stimuli, maximal length shift register sequences (m-sequences), have recently become particularly popular for extracting response kernels in insect motion vision. We here use such m-sequences to extract the impulse responses to figure motion in hoverfly lobula plate tangential cells (LPTCs). Figure motion is behaviorally important and many visually guided animals orient towards salient features in the surround. We show that LPTCs respond robustly to figure motion in the receptive field. The impulse response is scaled down in amplitude when the figure size is reduced, but its time course remains unaltered. However, a low contrast stimulus generates a slower response with a significantly longer <b>time-to-peak</b> and half-width. Impulse responses in females have a slower <b>time-to-peak</b> than males, but are otherwise similar. Finally we show that the shapes of the impulse response to a figure and a widefield stimulus are very similar, suggesting that the figure response could be coded by the same input as the widefield response...|$|E
