It officially premiered on Vevo on April 30, 2010. On working with Williams {{and the new}} looks she developed in the video, Aguilera stated, [...] "...someone with <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> catalog under his belt and success as a video maker, he's like a legend. So again entering into the collaborating factor, I didn't {{know what to expect}} ... and he's probably thinking the same about me. And when we walked away from working with each other, it was just a love connection. I wanted to maintain and keep consistent with the look of the album packaging and book, and I really wanted to keep all that in line, and so he really paid attention, and I think it's really iconic and classic. We totally made magic together on a creative level, it was absolutely amazing. He really got in and listened to where my music was at".|$|E
500|$|Initially, Ed Wood was in {{development}} with Columbia, but when Burton {{decided he wanted}} to shoot the film in black-and-white, studio head Mark Canton would not agree to it unless Columbia was given a first look deal. Burton said black-and-white was [...] "right for the material and the movie, and this was a movie that had to be in black-and-white". He insisted on total creative control, and so in April 1993, a month before the original start date, Canton put Ed Wood into turnaround. The decision sparked interest from Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox in optioning the film rights, but Burton accepted an offer from Walt Disney Studios, who had previously produced The Nightmare Before Christmas. Similar to Nightmare, Disney released Ed Wood under their Touchstone Pictures banner. With a budget of $18 million, Disney did not feel the film was <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> risk, and granted Burton total creative autonomy. Burton also refused a salary, and was not paid for his work on Ed Wood. Principal photography began in August 1993, and lasted 72 days. Despite his previous six-film relationship with Danny Elfman, Burton chose Howard Shore to write the film score. Under the pressure of finishing the score for Batman Returns, Burton's relationship with Elfman became strained and Burton admitted he and Elfman experienced [...] "creative differences" [...] during The Nightmare Before Christmas.|$|E

On 8 February 1998 Powell died aged 85 at the King Edward VII Hospital for Officers in Westminster, London. His study of the Gospel of John remained unfinished.|$|E

Anyone who’s read Guy Gardner for {{the last}} two years in Green Lantern or in Green Lantern Corps knows <b>that</b> he’s a <b>much</b> better, stronger character than that. And even in the old Giffen stuff, he would probably break some rules, taunt the other heroes, and drink a beer or two, but he would not be <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> idiot. He was never <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> idiot, and certainly not with what I'm doing with him, or with what Dave Gibbons is doing with him in Corps. He has his moments, and he’s a really fun character, but he's definitely not going to be a moron. His role is not DCU Moron. His role is DCU Shitkicker." ...|$|R

50|$|Although the {{toxicity}} of cadmium {{may not be}} <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> issue and environmental concerns completely resolved with the recycling of CdTe modules {{at the end of}} their life time, there are still uncertainties and the public opinion is skeptical towards this technology. The usage of rare materials may also become a limiting factor to the industrial scalability of CdTe thin film technology. The rarity of tellurium—of which telluride is the anionic form—is comparable to that of platinum in the earth's crust and contributes significantly to the module's cost.|$|R

2500|$|In 1994 AVE trains on the Madrid–Seville line {{began to}} run at 300km/h, cutting journey times by at least 40 minutes and {{covering}} the 471km in 2½ hours, though it is unlikely <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> saving came from the increase in maximum speed, because only a small section of the line near Los Yébenes has the alignments for 300km/h operation. [...] The maximum permitted speed is 270km/h between Atocha station and Brazatortas, save for the approaches to the intermediate stations (Atocha, Ciudad Real and Puertollano). Beyond Brazatortas, the line is only authorised for 250km/h operation, which drops to 215km/h in the Sierra Morena mountains and 90km/h around Córdoba station. It {{is more likely that}} time savings occurred as a result of there being fewer intermediate stops.|$|E

"Camping", {{which is}} a widely {{recognized}} expression for staying in one location (usually somewhat protected or with only one access route) and eventually using long range weapons, such as a sniper rifle, from that location. In standard deathmatch, camping is not <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> issue, as in most maps, fierce close range combat generates frags faster than sniping from afar. In LMS, however, camping increases the average lifespan. Unreal Tournament 2003 addresses this unfairness by indicating players who are camping and providing other players with navigation to campers.|$|R

If you attentively regard almost any quadruped's spine, you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebrae {{of which he was}} inlaying, in a sort of basso-relieve, the beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal.
