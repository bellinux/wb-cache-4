As stated above, nanotubes are quite different in chemical and physical properties to C60, i.e., molecular weight, shape, size, physical properties (such as solubility) all are very different, so from a toxicological standpoint, different results for C60 and nanotubes are not suggestive of any discrepancy in the findings.|$|E

30|$|Sediments are a {{well-known}} sink {{for a large}} variety of pollutants that may cause distress to benthic and pelagic species in case of their remobilization to the water-phase [1]. Risk assessment of complex mixtures may involve component-based approaches by applying chemical analysis together with measured or predicted toxicity data of individual components and mixture risk modeling or whole mixture approaches using bioassays. Both are complementary and thus their integration using chemical and bioanalytical tools for the characterization of sediment contamination should provide a more comprehensive picture of ecotoxicological risks to aquatic organisms [2]. In addition to effect concentrations, bioassays may provide information on modes of action (MoA) and may thus improve the diagnosis of risks in sediment samples [3 – 10]. In the last years, batteries of sensitive, rapid and cost-effective in vitro bioassays have been proposed as promising tools for the <b>toxicological</b> <b>profiling</b> of environmental samples and were also successfully applied for the characterization of aquatic sediments [11 – 17]. However, despite the undoubted advantages of cell-based assays {{for the analysis of}} toxicological patterns in sediments, in vitro results cannot directly predict the biological responses in more complex organisms and aquatic communities [18]. Moreover, only a minority of MoA covered by in vitro assays are suited to test complex environmental mixtures [19] including important toxic endpoints such as neurotoxicity [20]. Thus, in vitro tools need to be complemented with diagnostic in vivo monitoring. However, accepted and validated workflows for the in vivo <b>toxicological</b> <b>profiling</b> of complex mixtures including sediment contamination are still lacking.|$|R
