It is shown directly that the row transfer matrices of <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> models satisfy special functional equations. Intertwiners between <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> A–D–E models are constructed by <b>fusing</b> <b>the</b> cells that intertwine the elementary face weights. As an example, we calculate explicitly <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> 2 × 2 face weights of the 3 -state Potts model associated with the D 4 diagram as well as <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> intertwiner cells for the A 5 –D 4 intertwiner.

5000|$|A {{study on}} the {{transportation}} impacts of <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> grid [...] asserted through comparative analysis using computer-based traffic modeling that <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> grid produces <b>the</b> least total delay in all four density scenarios tested and performed progressively better as the density increased. Taking <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> grid as 100 (base), the delay was 32% more for the conventional Radburn-type pattern and 27% higher for the grid-type pattern. At the next higher density level the difference between patterns increased and they were correspondingly 100 (fused grid), 152 (Radburn-type) and 126 (grid -type). Traffic modeling shows the potential of <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> grid to reduce time delay during peak hours and, therefore, congestion.|$|R

The fire was eventually brought under control, but not without the death of five men and several more seriously burnt when the blazing mainmast collapsed. Problems were also experienced aboard Bellona, where Captain Duodo planned to ignite the powder magazine and destroy the ship following its surrender. Duodo had been mortally wounded in the action, and so ordered his second in command to light <b>the</b> <b>fuse.</b> The officer promised to do so, but instead handed control of the magazine to the British prize crew when they arrived.

40|$|In dry toner electrophotography, hot-roll <b>fusing</b> is <b>the</b> method most {{commonly}} used to fix the toner to the media.

40|$|We {{propose a}} convex {{formulation}} of <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> lasso signal approximation problem consisting of non-convex penalty functions. <b>The</b> <b>fused</b> lasso signal model aims to estimate a sparse piecewise constant signal from a noisy observation. Originally, the ℓ_ 1 norm {{was used as}} a sparsity-inducing convex penalty function for <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> lasso signal approximation problem.

5|$|Conventional {{defensive}} weapons {{included the}} anti-aircraft artillery piece. The three main types were the 4.5-inch, 3.7-inch and 3-inch guns. The first two were modern, and effective over 8000 metres (26,000 feet). The last was a First World War weapon effective only to 4,250 metres (14,000 feet). Usually batteries were sited in fours, with a range-finder and predictor which measured the speeds and heights of enemy aircraft while {{taking into account}} the time shell took to reach their intended targets, thus calculating when to detonate <b>the</b> <b>fuse</b> in the shell. As with most artillery weapons firing at aircraft, the higher the shell travelled the less effective it became. A shell fired to 1,500 metres (5,000 feet) would only be half as effective at 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) and a quarter as accurate at 4,500 metres (15,000 feet). The German bombers usually tried to fly around heavy concentrations of anti-aircraft guns, and if forced to fly through them, chose to fly at heights of around 4,500 metres (15,000 feet).|$|E

Some sources assert that <b>the</b> <b>fuse</b> was lit at around 1:00 pm, although the 19th-century local historian Heinrich Joseph Floß argued that these sources are mistaken, and that the explosion clearly occurred in the morning. All sources agree that the explosion, with a dreadful crack, propelled chunks of the towers and walls high into the air. Almost half the Godesburg collapsed instantly.

40|$|A new {{model-free}} {{screening method}} called <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> Kolmogorov filter is proposed for high-dimensional data analysis. This new method is fully nonparametric and {{can work with}} many types of covariates and response variables, including continuous, discrete and categorical variables. We apply <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> Kolmogorov filter to deal with variable screening problems emerging {{from a wide range}} of applications, such as multiclass classification, nonparametric regression and Poisson regression, among others. It is shown that <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> Kolmogorov filter enjoys the sure screening property under weak regularity conditions that are much milder than those required for many existing nonparametric screening methods. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> Kolmogorov filter can still be powerful when covariates are strongly dependent on each other.

40|$|In pixel-level image {{sequence}} fusion, {{a composite}} image sequence {{has to be}} built of several spatially registered input image sequences. One of the primary goals in image sequence fusion is the temporal stability and consistency of <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> image sequence. To fulfill the preceding desiderata, we propose a novel approach based on a shift invariant extension of the 2 D discrete wavelet transform, which yields an overcomplete and thus shift invariant multiresolution signal representation. The advantage of the shift invariant fusion method is the improved temporal stability and consistency of <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> sequence, compared to other multiresolution fusion methods. To evaluate temporal stability and consistency of <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> sequence we introduce a quality measure based on the mutual information between the inter-frame-differences (IFD) of the input sequences and <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> image sequence.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>fused</b> six-vertex {{models with}} open {{boundary}} conditions are studied. The eigenvalues and the Bethe ansatz equations {{of the transfer}} matrices of <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> models have been given starting from Sklyanin's Bethe ansatz solutions.

5|$|On 13 March 1943, in {{preparation}} for the Battle of Kursk, Hitler visited the Eastern Front at Smolensk. Originally the plan was for certain officers to shoot Hitler collectively at a signal given in the officers' mess during lunch. However, that plan was cast aside. Instead a second plan devised by General Henning von Tresckow's Nazi resistance group was carried out. Upon leaving, staff officer Heinz Brandt, who was traveling in Hitler's entourage, agreed to take a box containing two bottles of cognac to Colonel Helmuth Stieff who was stationed at Hitler's headquarters. The package was given to Brandt by Tresckow. The cognac bottles were actually a bomb placed into a casing, with a timer fuse. The plane took off with both Hitler and Brandt on board, but it arrived safely at the Wolf's Lair field headquarters in East Prussia. The bomb most likely failed to detonate because the extremely low temperatures in the unheated luggage compartment of the plane prevented <b>the</b> <b>fuse</b> from operating properly.|$|E

5|$|To pack a muzzle-loading cannon, first {{gunpowder}} {{is poured}} down the bore. This {{is followed by}} a layer of wadding (often nothing more than paper), and then the cannonball itself. A certain amount of windage allows the ball to fit down the bore, though the greater the windage the less efficient the propulsion of the ball when the gunpowder is ignited. To fire the cannon, <b>the</b> <b>fuse</b> located in the vent is lit, quickly burning down to the gunpowder, which then explodes violently, propelling wadding and ball down the bore and out of the muzzle. A small portion of exploding gas also escapes through the vent, but this does not dramatically affect the total force exerted on the ball.|$|E

After removing a fuse from his lorry's tachograph to conceal the journey, he drove to Worcestershire.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>fused</b> Lasso penalty enforces {{sparsity}} in {{both the}} coefficients and their successive differences, which is desirable for applications with features ordered in some meaningful way. The resulting problem is, however, challenging to solve, as <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> Lasso penalty is both non-smooth and non-separable.

In this paper, we propose an Efficient Fused Lasso Algorithm (EFLA) for optimizing this class of problems.

To efficiently solve FLSA, we propose to reformulate it as the problem of finding an “appropriate " subgradient of <b>the</b> <b>fused</b> penalty at <b>the</b> minimizer, and develop a Subgradient Finding Algorithm (SFA). We further design a restart technique to accelerate the convergence of SFA, by exploiting the special “structures " of both the original and the reformulated FLSA problems.
