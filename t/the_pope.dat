5|$|Around 877, Æthelred {{wrote to}} Pope John VIII to {{complain}} about King Alfred's conduct towards Canterbury. The exact nature of the dispute is not clear, but the reply from <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> to the archbishop still exists. <b>The</b> <b>pope</b> told the archbishop that Canterbury had papal support and that <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> had written to the king urging the king to respect {{the rights of the}} archbishop. The writer Justin Pollard sees this letter as evidence of papal support for the deposition of Alfred, which Pollard alleges occurred at Christmas 878 and that the deposition was supported by Æthelred. Other historians, however, do not agree that there was a deposition of the king supported by the archbishop at this time.|$|E
5|$|In 1527 King Henry VIII asked Pope Clement VII to annul his {{marriage}} to Katherine of Aragon, but <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> refused. This started {{a series of events}} known as English Reformation in which Henry broke away from the authority of <b>the</b> <b>pope.</b> In lieu of <b>the</b> <b>pope,</b> Henry assumed authority over the church: all priests and religious figures, including monks, were required to swear support to the royal supremacy over the church. Abbot Bourchier and the 25 canons at Leicester Abbey acknowledged the king's royal supremacy on 11 August 1534, thereby saving the abbey from immediate dissolution.|$|E
5|$|In {{the matter}} of the annulment, no {{progress}} seemed possible. <b>The</b> <b>Pope</b> seemed more afraid of Emperor Charles V than of Henry. Anne and Cromwell and their allies wished simply to ignore <b>the</b> <b>Pope,</b> but in October 1530 a meeting of clergy and lawyers advised that Parliament could not empower the archbishop to act against the Pope's prohibition. Henry thus resolved to bully the priests.|$|E

5|$|Michelangelo, {{who was not}} {{primarily}} a painter but a sculptor, was reluctant {{to take on the}} work. Also, he was occupied with a very large sculptural commission for the pope's own tomb. <b>The</b> <b>pope</b> was adamant, leaving Michelangelo no choice but to accept.

5|$|No Bishop or Diocese of Finland is {{mentioned}} in a papal letter from 1171 (or 1172) by the seemingly well-informed Pope Alexander III, who otherwise addressed {{the situation of}} the church in Finland. <b>The</b> <b>Pope</b> mentions that there were preachers, presumably from Sweden, working in Finland and was worried about their bad treatment by the Finns. <b>The</b> <b>Pope</b> had earlier in 1165 authorized the first missionary Bishop of Estonia to be appointed, and was a close acquaintance of both Eskil, the Archbishop of Lund, and Stefan, the Archbishop of Uppsala, who both had spent time with him in France where he had been exiled in the 1160s. Following the situation in Estonia, <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> personally interfered in the Estonian mission in 1171, ordering assistance for the local Bishop Fulco from Norway.|$|E
25|$|During the 5th and 6th centuries, <b>the</b> <b>popes</b> {{increased}} their influence in both {{religious and political}} matters in Italy.

For about 200 years <b>the</b> <b>popes</b> opposed attempts by the Lombards, who had captured most of Italy, to take over Rome as well. <b>The</b> <b>popes</b> finally defeated <b>the</b> Lombards {{with the aid of}} two Frankish kings, Pepin the Short and Charlemagne.

5|$|Relations were hostile {{with both}} Sweden and Denmark from the start. During his rivalry with Earl Skule, Skule {{attempted}} {{to gain the}} support of Valdemar II of Denmark, but any aid was made impossible after Valdemar's capture {{by one of his}} vassals. Since the Danes wanted overlordship of Norway and supported the Guelphs (those supporting <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> over the Holy Roman Emperor), Haakon in turn sought closer ties with the Ghibelline Emperor Frederick II, who sent ambassadors to Norway. As Haakon had gained a powerful reputation due to the strength of his fleet, other European rulers wanted to benefit from his friendship. Despite the struggle between <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> and the Emperor, Haakon was able to maintain friendships with both. According to an English chronicler, <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> wanted Haakon to become Holy Roman Emperor. It has been suggested that Haakon hesitated to leave Norway due to the Mongol threat.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before Anselm {{went into}} exile in 1097 Warelwast searched his baggage, {{probably}} looking for communications to <b>the</b> <b>pope,</b> either from Anselm or other English bishops {{rather than for}} valuables, and in particular for any letters of complaint. Warelwast was the king's envoy at Rome when during his exile Anselm petitioned to have the king excommunicated, which according to Eadmer, who was also present, Warelwast succeeded in preventing by bribing <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> and papal officials.

5|$|This Bull was {{confirmed}} by Pope Alexander's successor Pope Lucius III. Jocelin had obtained this confirmation while at Rome in late 1181 and early 1182. He had been sent there by King William, along with abbots of Melrose, Dunfermline and Kelso and the prior of Inchcolm, in order to appeal to <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> regarding his stance in a struggle over the Bishopric of St Andrews and the sentence of excommunication and interdict <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> had placed over the king and kingdom. The dispute concerned the election to the bishopric of John the Scot, which had been opposed by the king, who organised the election of his own candidate, Hugh. The mission was successful. <b>The</b> <b>Pope</b> lifted the interdict, absolved the king and appointed two legates to investigate {{the issue of the}} St Andrews succession. <b>The</b> <b>Pope</b> even sent the king a Golden Rose, an item usually given to the Prefect of Rome. The issue of the succession, however, did not go away. In 1186, Jocelin, along with the abbots of Melrose, Dunfermline and Newbattle, excommunicated Hugh on the instructions of Pope Lucius. Hugh travelled to Rome in 1188, and obtained absolution, but he died of the pestilence in that city a few days later, thus allowing the issue to be resolved.|$|E
