The change in Australian English vowels was investigated by means of a cross-sectional apparent time study of 54 subjects covering three generations of speakers, taken from the Australian National Database of Spoken Language.

5|$|In 1965, the Museum Society raised $40,000 {{to mount}} the grand portal of the old church. It was {{installed}} in the de Young Museum, the centerpiece of Hearst Court, the main exhibit hall. The rest of the stones were abandoned by the museum in May 1969 with the announcement <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> reconstruction. After this, stones were occasionally taken by park workers and used to decorate Golden Gate Park.|$|E
5|$|Boycott {{himself said}} {{that he did not want}} such a large number of Ulstermen, as he had saved the grain harvest himself, and that only ten or fifteen labourers were needed to save the root crops. He feared that a large number of Ulstermen would lead to sectarian violence. While local Land League leaders said <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> trouble from them if the aim was simply to harvest the crops, more extreme {{sections}} of the local population did threaten violence against the expedition and the troops.|$|E
5|$|General Mack {{thought that}} Austrian {{security}} relied on sealing off the gaps through the mountainous Black Forest area in Southern Germany that had witnessed much fighting during the campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars. Mack believed <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> action in Central Germany. Mack {{decided to make}} the city of Ulm the centerpiece of his defensive strategy, which called for a containment of the French until the Russians under Kutuzov could arrive and alter the odds against Napoleon. Ulm was protected by the heavily fortified Michelsberg heights, giving Mack the impression that the city was virtually impregnable from outside attack.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, British prime {{minister}} Gordon Brown {{had a meeting}} with Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and said <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> further talks over the sovereignty of the Falklands. In March 2013, the Falkland Islands held a referendum on its political status, with 99.8 percent of voters favoured remaining under British rule. Argentina does not recognise the Falkland Islands as a partner in negotiations; consequently, it dismissed the Falkland Islands' sovereignty referendum.|$|E
5|$|In April 2010 The Guardian {{published}} {{an open letter}} from several public figures asking the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to proceed with a prosecution or explain its position. In July that year Keir Starmer, director of the CPS, announced <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> prosecution because of the medical disagreement between the three pathologists. Starmer said there was enough evidence for an assault charge, but the six-month deadline for that had expired.|$|E
5|$|On 6 April 2015, an Indonesian court {{rejected}} {{an appeal}} by Chan and Sukumaran, ruling {{that they could}} not challenge the decision by the Indonesian president to grant them clemency in court. One of their lawyers announced that a further appeal would be lodged with the Indonesian Constitutional Court to examine Widodo's refusal to give clemency. However, the Indonesian Attorney-General accused the lawyers of simply trying to buy time, and announced <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> more delays to the executions.|$|E

5|$|The PSO {{project cost}} the {{ministry}} at least 25 million.

Following the left-winged Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet's victory in the 2005 parliamentary election, the new Minister of Transport, Liv Signe Navarsete from the Centre Party, announced <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> more public tenders in the railway sector. The government stated that experience from Sweden and the United Kingdom showed that employees rights and safety was reduced after privatization was introduced.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} Copperhead is unclear. The visit was {{reported}} up the German chain of command, and some double agents later received {{requests for information}} about Montgomery's movements. There {{is no indication that}} Montgomery's appearance affected German views of the imminent invasion threat. Writing in 2011, historian Joshua Levine attributes this {{to the fact that the}} deception was carried out ten days before D-Day, arguing <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> reason for a flying visit to North Africa to preclude an imminent invasion.|$|E
5|$|The poem was {{revised and}} {{included}} in Keats's 1820 collection of poetry titled Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems. Although the publishers Taylor and Hessey feared {{the kind of}} bad reviews that had plagued Keats's 1818 edition of Endymion, {{they were willing to}} publish the collection after the removal of any potentially controversial poems to ensure <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> politically motivated reviews that could give the volume a bad reputation.|$|E

5|$|To {{regain his}} strength, Edwards {{and his wife}} took a {{carriage}} to a rustic cottage refuge in Arkville in the Catskill Mountains but isolation, plain food and rest yielded little improvement. A physician was called and he informed Mrs. Edwards <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> recovery for her husband from the advanced Bright's disease with complications from chronic pneumonia so she {{brought him back to}} New York City. Edwards died at home at 185 East 116th Street in East Harlem late on June 9, 1891, just hours after returning.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite {{began to}} {{emphasize}} a strict hierarchy, teaching that his students needed his guidance, as {{he needed the}} guidance of the Next Level. Zeller notes that this naturally ensured <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> possibility of the group's continuing if Applewhite were to die. A relationship with Applewhite was said to {{be the only way to}} salvation; he encouraged his followers to see him as Christ. Zeller states that the group's previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite's role as a mediator. Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but, in the 1980s, the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority.|$|E
5|$|Despite stating {{during the}} press tour <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> live album from the tour, the {{performances}} at Sydney Entertainment Centre – Sydney on 7 and 9 November 1987 were filmed and released on video as Glass Spider in 1988. An edit {{of this show}} was subsequently aired in the US in an ABC TV concert special, ABC's first concert special since airing Elvis Presley's Aloha from Hawaii in 1973. A 2007 DVD re-release of the show included an audio recording of the performance at the Olympic Stadium, Montreal on 30 August 1987. The 6 June 1987 Platz der Republik (Reichstag – City Of Berlin Festival) performance was broadcast live on FM Radio.|$|E

5|$|Following Bound for Glory IV, TNA {{continued}} the rivalry between the veteran wrestlers {{and the younger}} wrestlers. At Turning Point on November9, TNA held several matches connected to this overall narrative. Since Samoa Joe and Sting agreed on the stipulation <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> rematch between the two, Sting went on to feud with A.J. Styles while Joe fought Kevin Nash. On the October23 episode of Impact!, the veterans in TNA formed the group The Main Event Mafia, consisting of Sting, Kurt Angle, Nash, Booker T, and Scott Steiner. Meanwhile, the younger wrestlers formed The TNA Front Line led by Joe and Styles.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev's U.S. visit {{resulted}} in an informal agreement with U.S. president Dwight Eisenhower <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> firm deadline over Berlin, but {{that there would be}} a four-power summit to try to resolve the issue, and the premier left the U.S. to general good feelings. Khrushchev returned from the U.S. convinced that he had achieved a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower (who in fact was unimpressed by the Soviet leader) and that he could achieve détente with the Americans. He pushed for an immediate summit, but was frustrated by French President Charles de Gaulle, who postponed it until 1960, a year in which Eisenhower was scheduled to pay a return visit to the Soviet Union.|$|E
