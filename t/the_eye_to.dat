5|$|Hurricane Cora was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1978 Atlantic hurricane season to reach hurricane strength. Forming from a disturbance that exited the African coast on August 7, the storm moved at an unusually high forward speed for a cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean in August. The storm later reached hurricane strength and formed a well-defined eye that lasted only 12hours before the eye rapidly lost organization for unknown reasons, though the post-season report on the storm mentions the possibility that its high speed caused <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> dissipate. The storm moved west-southwestward, weakening before making landfall {{on the island of}} Grenada. The storm lost its circulation and became a tropical wave on August 12. The remnant crossed over Central America into the Pacific Ocean, where it reintensified, becoming Hurricane Kristy.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Cyclone Glenda was {{forecast}} {{to intensify}} further. However, a gradual increase in vertical shear caused <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> become disorganised, with land interaction contributing to further weakening. The BoM maintained Glenda as a Category5 cyclone until 29 March, and initially it was forecast to turn southward to move ashore near the populated region of Karratha at high tide. It retained its south west track and passed over several weather stations, {{one of which}} recorded sustained winds of 176km/h (109mph). Glenda made landfall near the less populated town of Onslow at around 10pm WST (1400UTC) on 30 March. The cyclone had weakened to a marginal Category 3 {{at the time of}} landfall. The JTWC issued its final warning on Glenda shortly after it moved ashore. The cyclone turned south and south-south-eastward and rapidly weakened over land in an area of increasing wind shear, and early on 31 March the BoM downgraded Glenda to a tropical low.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the IMD {{expected}} Chapala would intensify {{further into}} a super cyclonic storm, and the JTWC anticipated it would strengthen to {{the equivalent of}} a Category5-equivalent on the Saffir-Simpson scale. However, the storm began an eyewall replacement cycle on 30October, causing the inner eyewall to degrade and for an outer eyewall to form; this resulted in a slight drop in intensity. In addition, drier air began affecting the storm, causing the thunderstorms around <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> diminish. However, Chapala maintained much of its intensity due to strong outflow in all directions, especially to the northeast due to a tropical upper tropospheric trough over India, despite increased wind shear. On 31October, the outer eyewall became established, reaching a diameter of , although the thunderstorms around the eye continued to weaken. On 1November, Chapala passed just north of the island of Socotra, marking the area's first hurricane-force impact since 1922.|$|E

5|$|Late on March9, Dera passed about 20km (12mi) east of Europa Island, {{although}} the large eye {{passed over the}} island. On March10, Dera attained tropical cyclone status, and after a brief bout of wind shear, the eye became better defined. The cyclone attained peak 10minute winds of 150km/h (90mph) on March11, according to the MFR, and 1minute winds of 165km/h (105mph) according to the JTWC. Despite being located unusually far to the south, Dera maintained its intensity due to warm waters, and it accelerated southeastward due to an approaching cold front. Wind shear increased on March12, and only on that day did water temperatures drop off, causing a marked decrease in intensity and for <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> dissipate. Late on March12, Dera became extratropical, which continued southeastward along the cold front.|$|E
5|$|Late on November1, a large eye redeveloped, and the JTWC {{estimated}} Krosa attained peak 1minute sustained {{winds of}} 185km/h (115mph). Early the next day, the JMA also estimated the typhoon reached peak 10minute winds of 140km/h (85mph). Later, increasing wind shear caused <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> deteriorate, and Krosa began slowing about 260km (160mi) east-southeast of Hong Kong after reaching {{the western edge}} of the subtropical ridge. After remaining nearly stationary, Krosa began moving steadily to the west-southwest due to a new ridge. The convection continued to weaken due to continued shear and cooler waters from upwelling, and Krosa deteriorated to tropical storm status on November3. The next day, the JTWC issued its final advisory after the circulation became exposed from the convection. Also on November4, the JMA downgraded Krosa to tropical depression status off the northeast Vietnam coast. The system dissipated at 0000UTC on November5.|$|E
5|$|On December6 the {{hurricane}} {{turned to the}} south and southwest. As it did so, Epsilon passed beneath a mid-level trough that sheltered it from the wind shear. After weakening during the evening, the convection redeveloped around the large and distinct eye in the daytime, a process Epsilon had done repeatedly in its duration. However, late on December7, an approaching trough began increasing wind shear over the system, displacing the convection from the center and causing <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> dissipate. After maintaining hurricane status for five days, Epsilon weakened to tropical storm status about 920mi (1480km) southwest of the Azores.|$|E

5|$|Paley's Natural Theology is an {{extended}} argument, constructed around {{a series of}} examples including finding a watch; comparing <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> a telescope; {{and the existence of}} finely adapted mechanical structures in animals, such as joints which function like hinges or manmade ball and socket joints. Paley argues that these all lead to an intelligent Creator, and that a system is {{more than the sum of}} its parts. The last chapters are more theological in character, arguing that the attributes of God must be sufficient for the extent of his operations, and that God must be good because designs seen in nature are beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Several {{terrestrial}} starlings, {{including those}} in the genus Sturnus, have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing. This adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling (along with the spotless and white-cheeked starlings), where the protractor muscles responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow, allowing <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> be moved forward to peer {{down the length of}} the bill. This technique involves inserting the bill into the ground and opening it as a way of searching for hidden food items. Common starlings have the physical traits that enable them to use this feeding technique, which has undoubtedly helped the species spread far and wide.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{attaining}} {{peak intensity}} on September20, Georges began to weaken, as upper-level vertical wind shear caused <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> become cloud-filled and {{was no longer}} visible on satellite imagery. Convection associated with the storm also became less symmetric in nature. In spite of these factors, Georges remained a major hurricane through September21. Continued weakening took place as the shear restricted {{a portion of the}} hurricane's outflow. At 0430UTC on September21, Georges made its initial landfall on Antigua with winds of 115mph (185km/h). Several hours later, the storm passed directly over St. Kitts. Shortly after passing over the island, the storm weakened to Category 2 status and winds decreased to 110mph (175km/h).|$|E

50|$|If {{instead of}} {{fixating}} the black cross, one follows the moving gap with one's eyes, one will see only a moving gap and 12 lilac discs {{rather than a}} single green disc. This is because the green disc arises as an afterimage, requiring <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> be held steadily to occur, and {{the disappearance of the}} lilac discs is from Troxler's fading, also requiring <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> be held steadily <b>to</b> occur. Moving <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> prevents <b>the</b> formation of afterimages and the occurrence of Troxler's fading.|$|R
5|$|The {{colour pattern}} varies, ranging from very light-coloured {{specimens}} with small, incomplete, dark dorsal crossbars to entirely brown ones with faint or clear, darker brown markings, {{and on to}} melanistic individuals that are entirely dark and lack any apparent dorsal pattern. However, most {{have some kind of}} zigzag dorsal pattern down the entire length of their bodies and tails. The head usually has a distinctive dark V or X on the back. A dark streak runs from <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> the neck and continues as a longitudinal series of spots along the flanks. Unusual for snakes, the sexes are possible to tell apart by the colour. Females are usually brownish in hue with dark-brown markings, the males are pure grey with black markings. The basal colour of males will often be slightly lighter than that of the females, making the black zigzag pattern stand out. The melanistic individuals are often females.|$|E
5|$|The merle Pomeranian is {{a recent}} color {{developed}} by breeders. It {{is a combination of}} a solid base color with lighter blue/grey patch which gives a mottled effect. The most common base colors for the effect are red/brown or black, although it can also appear with other colors. Combinations such as brindle merle or liver merle are not accepted in the breed standard. In addition, the eye, nose and paw pad are marshmallow color, changing parts of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> blue and the color on the nose and paw pads to become mottled pink and black.|$|E
5|$|To {{reach the}} cathedral, Garrett ventures through Old Quarter, a haunted, {{abandoned}} district of the City. Through {{an opening in}} the cathedral, The Eye informs Garrett of a nearby Keeper sanctuary, where he may learn how to unseal the cathedral. There, Garrett discovers that the cathedral was sealed to prevent the City's destruction by the Trickster. He learns that there are four talismans needed to remove the seal: two hidden in ancient ruins beneath the City, and two inside a Hammerite temple (in Thief Gold, one talisman is in possession of the mages and another was found at an opera house after it was taken from the caves below, while the other two are in the Lost City and the Hammerite Temple as in the original game). Garrett recovers the talismans and returns to the cathedral. After unsealing the cathedral, he learns that its inhabitants had been killed and made undead by The Eye. He returns <b>The</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>to</b> Constantine, who reveals himself to be the Trickster. Viktoria says that The Eye requires a flesh eye to function; she binds Garrett with vines and removes his right eye. The Trickster places it on the gemstone, and the two disappear through a portal. Garrett, left for dead, is found and freed by two Keepers. During his escape from the Trickster's mansion, he learns that the Trickster plans to use <b>The</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>to</b> revert the world to a wild state.|$|E

5|$|After {{maintaining}} its peak intensity for about 36hours, Francisco began weakening, after the eye lost definition due to building wind shear. By October21, the eye became ragged and cloud-filled while the overall satellite {{presentation of the}} storm became elongated. That day, the typhoon entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), which gave Francisco the local name Urduja; the agency would cease issuing advisories on October23. Conditions generally remained favorable, allowing <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> remain distinct despite a great reduction in the sustained winds. Dry air began affecting the tropical cyclone late on October22, cutting off the flow of moist air, and water temperatures cooled along the storm's track. As a result, the eye dissipated and the convection weakened. An approaching trough from the Korean peninsula weakened the ridge to the north, slowing the typhoon and allowing it to turn north and northeast on October24. Francisco weakened below typhoon status after passing 210km (130mi) southeast of Okinawa. The storm began interacting with the approaching cold front while it passed south of Japan, moving around the subtropical ridge. With increasing wind shear, the circulation became exposed from the convection, and the JTWC discontinued advisories on October25, declaring that Francisco was becoming extratropical. On the next day, Francisco completed its extratropical transition, but dissipated later on October26, to the southeast of Japan.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} peak intensity, {{an increase}} in wind shear caused <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> disappear, and the convection decreased significantly. On December1, the IMD estimated Agni weakened to cyclonic storm status, around which time the center became exposed from the convection. The cyclone continued its steady weakening continued due to the wind shear, the presence of dry air, and cooler water temperatures, and by December2, the IMD downgraded Agni to depression status, which was its final warning on the system. As it approached the coast of Somalia, it turned westward due to {{the building of a}} ridge over Saudi Arabia. Despite unfavorable conditions, thunderstorms briefly reformed over the circulation, which allowed the storm to maintain its intensity. By late on December3, Agni weakened to below tropical storm status, and the JTWC issued its final warning while the storm was about 450km (275mi) south-southeast of Cape Guardafui—the easternmost point of the Horn of Africa. The circulation became difficult to locate by early on December4, by which time the system had little remaining convection. It turned southwestward and later to the south, moving ashore on eastern Somalia before dissipating on December5 near Ceel Huur over water.|$|E
5|$|As Fefa turned {{more to the}} west, it paralleled {{the cooler}} waters, {{allowing}} <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> remain distinct as the hurricane remained well-organized. Despite moving over marginally warm sea surface temperatures and becoming involved with the Stratocumulus cloud field to its north, the hurricane restrengthened on August 4 to reach a secondary peak intensity of 105mph (170km/h) while located about 1,265miles (2,070km) east-southeast of Hilo, Hawai'i. After maintaining 105mph (170km/h) winds for about 18hours, Fefa weakened slightly due to increasing wind shear from a cold-core trough as it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center area of responsibility. As the shear increased, the cyclone weakened more rapidly, and on August 6 it weakened to a tropical storm while located about 650miles (1,060km) east of the island of Hawaii. Initially, forecasters predicted Fefa {{to turn to the}} northwest {{to the north of the}} Hawaiian Islands. However, the storm continued moving almost due westward as it steadily weakened. Aircraft reconnaissance flew into Fefa three times as it neared Hawaii. Late on August 7, Fefa weakened to a tropical depression a short distance of the island of Hawaii, and early on August 8 the depression began dissipating and degenerated into a tropical wave after moving onshore. The remnants tracked west-northwestward and passed south of the Hawaiian Islands until dissipating on August 9 to the northwest of Kauai.|$|E
