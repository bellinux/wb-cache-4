5|$|At {{medium to}} close range, an adult red-throated loon in either {{breeding}} or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised. However, in certain light conditions, {{at certain times}} in its moulting cycle, or at greater distances, it may be mistaken for another species—most commonly the black-throated loon, but also occasionally the great crested grebe. It shows more white {{on the head and}} neck than does the black-throated loon, and—provided it is not sitting low in the water—tends to show more white on <b>the</b> <b>flanks</b> as well. If it is sitting lower in the water, so that the white on <b>the</b> <b>flanks</b> is reduced to a patch on the rear flank (thus resembling the pattern of the black-throated loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative patch on the black-throated.|$|E

The present study is an attempt to determine what influence the extracellular matrix has on the initial outgrowth of the limb bud.

40|$|The {{life and}} the {{performance}} of an insert in metal cutting are mainly dependent on the heat that is generated in the contact zone on the tool rake and on <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> face with <b>the</b> transient and machined surfaces.

Hence knowledge of temperature on <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> face becomes important. The temperature on <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> face has been measured in this work for different CGI materials having different microstructure and physical properties in a turning operation. It has been seen that there is no significant difference of tool temperature noticed while machining different CGI materials having hardness from (140 - 236 HBW). For temperature measurement, special inserts assisted with gold-platinum thermocouple on <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> face were used.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{assessed}} {{the performance of}} a patient with right neglect (M. A. H.) across various manipulations of <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> paradigm.

H. responded to <b>the</b> <b>flanking</b> distractor on <b>the</b> left (ipsilesional) side as if it were the target, even when <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> appeared at left peripheral locations. A right (contralesional) flanker did not affect central identification performance (Experiment 1). The "ipsilesional capture" effect persisted when pretrial location markers were introduced to make <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> and target locations more clearly defined (Experiment 2). However, when <b>the</b> ipsilesional <b>flanker</b> appeared simultaneously with a contralesional flanker, central target detection improved to ceiling (Experiment 3). Interestingly, with these three-stimulus displays, congruency effects in reaction time only occurred in relation to <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> on <b>the</b> contralesional side (Experiment 3), suggesting impaired response selectivity to ipsilesional stimuli. Congruency effects were produced on both sides only when <b>the</b> two <b>flanking</b> distractors grouped together (by both onset and offset, Experiment 4) and when <b>the</b> ipsilesional <b>flanking</b> distractor grouped with the target by onset (lone contra offset, Experiment 4). The results are attributed to ipsilesional capture in central target detection, which is offset by temporal grouping processes when another stimulus appears on the contralateral side...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn {{electrophysiological}} and anatomical study {{identified the}} sensory inputs to the "flank" of the mouse's superior colliculus, a large, ventrolateral extension of layer IV (stratum griseum intermediate) {{that has no}} overlying visual layers (II and III). Electrophysiological recordings with subsequent histological localization showed that <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> receives predominantly somatosensory projections from the perioral region but not visual input. In its caudal parts, <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> also has limb and trunk somatosensory inputs and auditory inputs. The perioral somatosensory projections to <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> are ordered somatotopically. <b>The</b> <b>flank</b> is {{considered part of the}} superior colliculus since the perioral inputs are adjacent to inputs from mystacial vibrissae in the more medial parts of the superior colliculus, hence forming a single continuous map. The finding that no visual responses occur above <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> (due to <b>the</b> absence of superficial layers) or within it is in accord with the concept of an intermodality "spatial register". Since flank neurons have somatosensory receptive fields in non-visible parts of the body and they lack visual responses, <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> may be involved more in tactile-dependent rather than in vision-dependent orienting behaviors. Thus, the superior colliculus may, in parallel, carry out sensorimotor transformations related to (1) shift of gaze and (2) tactile-dependent behaviors not involving vision...|$|R
