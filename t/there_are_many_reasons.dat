When two Grand Lodges recognise and are in Masonic communication with each other, they are said to be , and the brethren of each may visit each other's Lodges and interact Masonically. When two Grand Lodges are not in amity, inter-visitation is not allowed. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> why one Grand Lodge will withhold or withdraw recognition from another, but the two most common are Exclusive Jurisdiction and Regularity.|$|E
5|$|The House of Lords' {{statement}} on parliamentary privilege {{was assessed by}} the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which recommended that Parliament not counter the decision in Pepper v Hart, but cautioned that this should not lead to any further weakening of parliamentary privilege. However, academics widely condemned the decision and the thinking behind it. Academic Aileen Kavanagh questioned the logic used; the House of Lords was essentially saying that, where a minister has made a statement about an act's intent that was not questioned by Parliament, that statement {{can be used as}} evidence. However, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> why Members of Parliament might not question a statement, and this does not necessarily indicate that they approve of it; {{in the case of the}} Finance Act, for example, it could simply be that as the statement was not going to be added to the statute, they found no reason to actively oppose it. At the same time, different Members of Parliament may approve of a statutory provision for different reasons. The fact that a minister gives certain reasons for including a provision does not necessarily indicate that Parliament agrees; only that Parliament also feels, for whatever reason, that the provision should be included. The decision also raises questions about the separation of powers in the United Kingdom; it has been consistently maintained that it is Parliament, not the executive, which passes legislation. If one accepts that statements by the executive can allow them to specify the meaning of particular laws without formally including them in statutes where they can be approved by Parliament, it violates this separation of powers, allowing the executive to make law.|$|E

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> for the Italian {{immigration}} to Argentina: Italy was enduring economic problems caused mainly by {{the unification of}} the Italian states into one nation.

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> for {{the history}} and {{continued}} prevalence of racial segregation in U.S. churches, including racism, denominational differences, and isolation. This segregation also has effects on individuals and the larger society, including increased racism and segregation even outside of the church. However, segregated Black churches also have been a positive place for community organizing for civil rights and other issues, as well as offering a respite for Black individuals from the racism they face in integrated society.|$|E
25|$|As of 2007, 17% of incarcerated {{individuals}} in Canada were of Aboriginal descent, despite representing only 2.7% {{of the general}} population. This is a sixfold increase in rates of incarceration within the Aboriginal population {{as opposed to the}} general Canadian population. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> for the over-representation of Aboriginals within the Canadian justice system. Lack of education, poverty, unemployment and abuse all lead to higher crime rates. Also, statistically, Aboriginals have a greater chance of conviction and subsequently, incarceration once convicted. They are also much less likely to receive parole during their sentence.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> why {{underwater}} archaeology {{can make a}} significant contribution to our knowledge of the past. In the shipwreck field alone, individual shipwrecks can be of significant historical importance either because of the magnitude of loss of life (such as the Titanic) or circumstances of loss (Housatonic was the first vessel in history sunk by an enemy submarine). Shipwrecks such as Mary Rose can also be important for archaeology because they can form a kind of accidental time capsule, preserving an assemblage of human artifacts at the moment in time when the ship was lost.|$|E

25|$|The book The Dance of Change states <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> why an {{organization}} {{may have trouble}} in transforming itself into a learning organization. The first is that {{an organization}} {{does not have enough}} time. Employees and management may have other issues that take priority over trying to change the culture of their organization. The team {{may not be able to}} commit the time if an institution does not have the appropriate help or training. For an organization to be able to change, it needs to know the steps necessary to solve the problems it faces. As a solution, a mentor or coach who is well versed in the learning organization concept may be necessary.|$|E

And as his diamondlike injunction came down upon my head, I earnestly gave myself to the task.|$|E
25|$|While {{a health}} care {{provider}} visit with a patient may result in the patient leaving with a prescription for medication, not all patients will fill the prescription at a pharmacy. In the U.S., 20-30% of prescriptions are never filled at the pharmacy. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> patients do not fill prescriptions including {{the cost of the}} medication, doubting the need for medication, or preference for self-care measures other than medication. Cost may be a barrier to prescription drug adherence, but convenience, side effects and lack of demonstrated benefit are also significant factors to a complex situation. A US nationwide survey of 1,010 adults in 2001 found that 22% chose not to fill prescriptions because of the price, which is similar to the 20-30% overall rate of unfilled prescriptions. However, analysis by health insurers suggest that patient co-payment requirements can be reduced to $0 with little or no improvement in long-term adherence rates.|$|E

500|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> {{to avoid}} cars when a tornado is imminent. Severe {{thunderstorms}} which produce tornadoes can produce flooding rains, hail, and strong winds {{far from the}} tornado-producing area, {{all of which can}} make driving difficult or even impossible. Any of these situations can leave drivers stranded {{in the path of the}} tornado far from substantial shelter. [...] When coupled with driver panic, they may also result in dangerous but preventable accidents. [...] This situation would be magnified greatly if all the residents of a warned area left in their vehicles, which would cause traffic jams and accidents as the tornado approached. [...] Numerous victims of the deadly Wichita Falls, Texas tornado on April 10, 1979 died in their vehicles in such a situation.|$|E
500|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> why crusaders {{volunteered to}} [...] "take the cross". One {{particular}} reason was {{the desire of}} repentance. Remorse for the cruelty that he had inflicted upon his own brother may well have {{played a part in}} Lǫgmaðr's decision. If remorse was not a factor, it is possible that Lǫgmaðr merely intended to earn a pardon by way of a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Embarking upon a crusade could also be a means of escaping political tribulations and pressure at home, {{as in the case of}} the embattled Robert II, Duke of Normandy (died 1134). In Lǫgmaðr's case, his participation may have been a direct after-effect of Magnús' conquest of the Isles in 1098, or the aforesaid later revival of Uí Briain encroachment in Dublin and the Isles.|$|E
500|$|Raising {{a family}} {{is not an easy}} task, and {{deciding}} {{to go back to school}} while raising a family can be a monumentual decision for the family says Carol Jacobs of the Jewish Employ-ment & Vocational Service. Her advice to those considering going back to school is, [...] "Talk to an educational consultant and people in the field you want to be in." [...] She adds, [...] "This is a commitment and the decision should involve your family. Will you be available to go to your child's softball game or have time to cook dinner?" [...] <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> why someone may put off to school until their children are older, such as not wanting to leave them in the hand of a baby sitter constantly at such a young age. However, once the children get older the parent pursuing an education, may start missing school events that they would have normally attended. The guilt of having to leave a child while attending to educational matters is less when the child is old enough to be able to ask questions about where their parent is and comprehend the response. Even though pursuing an education while nurturing a family will have its cost, the benefits include getting a higher paying job, gaining more knowledge, and becoming more stable financially. Most of the time this burden will include the person trying to balance a job along with their family and schooling, because they still need to work in order to provide for their family at the present moment. For people who have a hard time fitting classes into their schedule around the needs of their family, there are options where they will be required to do all of the work for a course, but it will all take place online. For example, the University of Delaware and the University of Phoenix Online have both Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Master of Science in Nursing programs for people to complete online.|$|E
