500|$|Francis {{characterized}} Genevieve as [...] "harsh", attesting {{this quality}} to her past tragedy. In {{an interview with}} AOL, Francis said that, [...] "Although tragic <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> to her, she is not tragic." [...] Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps described Genevieve as an [...] "eerie bitch". Jamey Giddens of Zap2it described her as [...] "kooky" [...] and [...] "The Pervy-Odd Mob Mama". The soap opera's official website describes her relationship with Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers) as [...] "twisted" [...] and [...] "confusing". Genevieve was considerably [...] "darker" [...] than the role of Laura Spencer on General Hospital, which Francis loved. She said, [...] "It's so freeing to let your dark side shine {{for a minute and}} when you do a scene when you've been really evil, when the scene ends, you laugh. It's just fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Within {{his first}} year on Coronation Street, Thompson had acted out scenes that {{involved}} his character stealing a car, graffiting {{the wall of the}} local newsagents, and discovering that his mother's fiancée was having a gay affair with her male best friend. Still impressed with Thompson's acting ability, producers of the series had his contract extended to 2009. Reflecting on {{his first year}} in the soap, Thompson said: [...] "It's been a really strange year and a lot of <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b> It's been absolutely brilliant. The filming is everything that I could have wanted it to be. It's fantastic and I enjoy it more than anything." [...] He added: [...] "My favourite story lines so far have been doing the graffiti and stealing the car. I really enjoyed filming those two." ...|$|E
500|$|Within days of Rockefeller's announcement, Agnew {{was being}} wooed by {{supporters}} of {{the former vice president}} Richard Nixon, whose campaign for the Republican nomination was well under way. Agnew had no antagonism towards Nixon, and in the wake of Rockefeller's withdrawal had indicated that Nixon might be his [...] "second choice". When the two met in New York on March 29 they found an easy rapport. Agnew's words and actions after the April disturbances in Baltimore delighted conservative members of the Nixon camp such as Pat Buchanan, and also impressed Nixon. When on April 30 Rockefeller re-entered the race, Agnew's reaction was cool. He commended the governor as potentially a [...] "formidable candidate" [...] but did not commit his support: [...] "A lot of <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> since his withdrawal... I think I've got {{to take another look at}} this situation".|$|E

500|$|Pathways {{sold more}} copies than expected, making it Bungie's first {{commercial}} success. It {{was the third}} bestselling Macintosh title {{of the first half}} of 1994 after Myst and Sim City 2000, with projected seven-figure sales for the year. The game made Bungie enough money that the company was able to move from Seropian's apartment to a dedicated office in Chicago's South Side. At their new location, the Bungie team expanded and began work on another first-person shooter, Marathon. Interviewed by Inside Mac Games, Jones said that he did not believe that there would ever be a sequel to Pathways. [...] "There's a lot of reasons for that, one of them being that I tend to dislike sequels," [...] he said, [...] "A lot of cool <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> with the rendering technology since Pathways shipped, and it suggests some different products which don't really fit into the Pathways world." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{flashback}} episode [...] "What Lies Beneath", exploring Faye's {{decision to}} move to Holby, she is seen to fight with her husband James, then later step over his dead body on the stairs. Kensit explained: [...] "there's a scuffle and he pins her {{against the wall and}} practically tries to rape her. He ends up dead. It's the way she deals with it — she coolly steps over his body and leaves. It turns out similar <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> before." [...] Shortly after arriving in Holby, the character began a relationship with cardiothoracic registrar Sam Strachan (Tom Chambers). The situation soon escalated into a love triangle, with Sam reigniting his former relationship with Faye's colleague, Matron Chrissie Williams. Kensit said of the relationship in August 2007, as the storyline was ongoing: [...] "For Faye, Sam is not Mr Right, simply Mr Right Now. But Faye is not as sweet as she looks - there's a streak of toughness there... It's all going to get very messy!" [...] Upon discovering Sam's infidelity, the character terminated their relationship, and became involved with his colleague Joseph Byrne.|$|E
500|$|Season two {{is set in}} 1947, {{approximately}} {{six months}} to a year following the events of the first, with the time jump made to show [...] "people are in a little bit different positions, and <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> between these seasons that we maybe don't know about." [...] Fazekas noted that [...] "the challenge" [...] for the season was to find a way to reunite Carter with Edwin Jarvis since he is [...] "not an agent....that's a really important relationship, how do we keep them together?...The nice thing about Peggy this season is she's not having to hide her agenda from the SSR. [...] is helping her out, just in a different way." [...] Elaborating on the SSR's role in the season, Fazekas explained that when Markus and McFeely created the organisation for [...] it was inspired by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was [...] "somewhat disbanded after the war, because it was created because of World War II. So now that the war is over, things are changing. And in real history, the OSS sort of became the CIA and some of its other functions went under other departments. There's a little bit of change going on within SSR and so Thompson [...] has a boss [...] that's going to be saying, [...] "Look, things are changing, and you need to look out for yourself."" [...] The season also sees Daniel Sousa promoted to the chief of the Los Angeles SSR office.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, Brooks played Beverley Allitt in a BBC1 docu-drama called Beverley Allitt: Angel of Death, {{alongside}} Ian Kelsey. Producer Cathy Elliot said, [...] "It's a {{very sensitive}} issue and of course it's terrible for the parents to have the whole thing brought up. Each time it's brought up it's painful, {{but a lot of}} parents realise it's important it's kept in the public domain and that people are aware that <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> and that not a lot has been done since".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Doctor Who Magazine, Roberts stated that [...] "to a certain extent [...] " [...] in writing the episode.

2500|$|In October {{the same}} year, Marr reignited {{speculation}} when he hinted on BBC Radio 5 Live at a potential reunion in the future, saying that [...] "stranger <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> so, you know, who knows?" [...] Marr {{went on to}} say that [...] "It's no biggy. Maybe we will in 10 or 15 years' time when we all need to for whatever reasons, but right now Morrissey is doing his thing and I'm doing mine, so that's the answer really." [...] This suggested a change of heart, given that Marr had previously said reforming the band would be a bad idea.|$|E
2500|$|John P. O'Neill was a {{counter-terrorism}} {{expert and}} the Assistant Director of the FBI until late 2001. He {{retired from the}} FBI and was offered the position of director of security at the World Trade Center (WTC). He took the job at the WTC two weeks before 9/11. On September 10, 2001, O’Neill allegedly told two of his friends, [...] "We're due. And we're due for something big.... Some <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> in Afghanistan.

[...] This was the first indication of a possible Smiths reunion from Marr, who previously had said that reforming the band would be a bad idea. In 2008 Marr and Morrissey met and discussed the possibility of a reunion, but after initial enthusiasm from both parties, neither pursued the idea.|$|E
2500|$|Coleman {{served as}} a coach in various organizations, {{beginning}} with his service as pitching coach for the Spokane Indians. [...] The Spokane club was an affiliate of the Seattle Mariners in 1980 and 1981, but became an affiliate of the California Angels in 1982. [...] In 1983, the Spokane club disbanded, and the Angels gave Coleman a choice of taking over as pitching coach in Edmonton or becoming {{the manager of the}} Peoria Suns, the Angels' newly organized Single A affiliate. [...] Coleman chose the managerial position in Peoria. [...] Coleman joked about the foibles of his young players after arriving in Peoria:"One game, my right fielder dropped a fly ball.
