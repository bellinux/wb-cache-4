500|$|As {{recounted in}} Ovid's Metamorphoses, {{the death of}} Argus Panoptes also {{contains}} an explicit celestial reference: [...] "Argus lay dead; so many eyes, so bright quenched, and all hundred shrouded in one night.

500|$|... "Baby Don't Lie" [...] {{was written}} by Stefani, Ryan Tedder, Benny Blanco, and Noel Zancanella, with Tedder and Blanco also serving as the song's producers. It is a midtempo electropop and reggae-pop song which begins with Stefani announcing, [...] "Uh huh, here we go," [...] to a rubbery bass line and hand claps. The song also has a hip hop-inflected breakdown, in which Stefani raps, [...] "You can tell me what you're hidin' boy/And {{you can tell me}} if I'm gettin' warm". Lyrically, the song {{discusses}} insecurities in a relationship, where Stefani questions her man's love. Nolan Feeney of Time complimented that the song is [...] "about falling in love with someone who's got a few skeletons in their closet." [...] As noted by Spins Brennan Carley, [...] "Stefani sounds shattered as she sings, [...] "But there's something behind <b>those</b> <b>eyes</b> / <b>Those</b> <b>eyes</b> / That you can't that you can't disguise / Disguise." [...] In the [...] "stomping, infuriatingly catchy" [...] chorus she sings, [...] "Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie…/I don't want to cry no longer." [...] Melodically, [...] "Baby don't Lie" [...] is written in the key of B♭ minor, performed in a common time moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute and follows the sequence B♭m - G♭ - D♭ as its chord progression. Stefani's voice spans two octaves from the lowest note A♭3 to the highest note A♭5.|$|E

2500|$|Panu {{expressed}} a reserved {{attitude toward the}} 1907 peasants' revolt and did not approve of it. He died in Bucharest, and was eulogized by Garabet Ibrăileanu in hallowed terms {{in the pages of}} Viața Românească: [...] "with a proud awkwardness, with the admirable and manly ugliness of a robust person, with <b>those</b> <b>eyes</b> that watched with a sort of painful hatred, with his clipped tones and voice hoarse from passion, G. Panu approached the podium as if from amidst the oppressed and those living in the shadows, as an avenger of theirs".|$|E

And she's got <b>those</b> <b>eyes!</b> She’s like our own Bianca Jagger. Adriana is a new take on the supermodel - she's from a different era.

2500|$|Motivated by jealousy, Figaro tells Bartolo and Basilio {{to come to}} his aid when {{he gives}} the signal. Basilio {{comments}} on Figaro's foolishness and claims he was once as frivolous as Figaro was. He tells a tale of how he was given common sense by [...] "Donna Flemma" [...] ("Dame Prudence") and learned the importance of not crossing powerful people. (aria: In quegli anni – [...] "In those years"). They exit, leaving Figaro alone. Figaro muses bitterly on the inconstancy of women (recitative and aria: Tutto è disposto ... Aprite un po' quegli occhi – [...] "Everything is ready ... Open <b>those</b> <b>eyes</b> a little"). Susanna and the Countess arrive, each dressed in the other's clothes. Marcellina is with them, having informed Susanna of Figaro's suspicions and plans. After they discuss the plan, Marcellina and the Countess leave, and Susanna teases Figaro by singing a love song to her beloved within Figaro's hearing (aria: Deh vieni, non tardar – [...] "Oh come, don't delay"). Figaro is hiding behind a bush and, thinking the song is for the Count, becomes increasingly jealous.|$|E
2500|$|Chamberlain, {{the self-proclaimed}} [...] "Evangelist of Race" [...] {{saw himself as}} a prophet, writing to the Kaiser: [...] "Today, God relies only on the Germans. That is the knowledge, the sure truth, which has filled my soul for years; I have sacrificed my peace in serving it; for it I shall live and die". Eulenburg {{recalled}} that under his quiet demeanor that Chamberlain had a [...] "fiery spirit with <b>those</b> <b>eyes</b> and looks which speak volumes." [...] The few who knew Chamberlain well described him as a quiet, reserved man full of urbane erudition and charm; a modest, genial character with elegant manners dressed in expensive suits who could talk brilliantly and with much wit about {{a great number of}} subjects for hours. Under his polished surface, Chamberlain had a [...] "fanatical and obsessive" [...] side, whose copious notebooks and letters show a man with [...] "a profoundly irrational mind", a markedly sadistic and deeply paranoid individual whom believed himself to be the victim of a monstrous worldwide Jewish conspiracy to destroy him. Chamberlain's status as a semi-recluse was because of his fear that the Jews were plotting his murder.|$|E
2500|$|Jaci Stephen {{from the}} Daily Mail praised the casting of Essex in the role, saying, [...] "There {{is always a}} frisson of {{excitement}} when a big star joins a soap. [...] None, however, has excited {{me as much as}} the arrival of David Essex in EastEnders. It is inspired casting, not only because the part of Eddie Moon fits Essex like a glove, but because he brings a gravitas to the show. And <b>those</b> <b>eyes.</b> Goodness, those beautiful eyes." [...] Stephen went on to positively review Eddie's arrival, saying, [...] "It made for a great start to the week, with David Essex's exquisite comic timing bringing some light-hearted relief to the rather heavy Moon/Mitchell stuff of late." [...] Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror also positively reviewed Eddie's arrival in Albert Square, saying, [...] "Dressed in a smart, black three-piece whistle and flute [...] and a white button-down collar shirt, the dapper grey-haired man looks like he could have been a guest at a Big, Fat Gypsy Wedding. But within four minutes of arriving in Albert Square on Monday, he's been knocked over by Carol's car as he snatches Roxy's toddler Amy from its path. Although there have been reports that this newcomer has been banned from singing in the Vic, within 15 minutes he's croaking out a line from the Leyton Orient supporters' song. This is the grand entrance of former 70s teen idol David Essex" [...] Conversely, Jim Shelley, also from the Daily Mirror, criticised Eddie's arrival, saying, [...] "on Monday they blessed us with the arrival of Whispering David Essex as Eddie Moon, the latest example of the Long-Lost Relative Who Has Never Been Mentioned Before that is routine in soaps nowadays. [...] Eddie had been in EastEnders three whole minutes before the writers unleashed the bi-annual cliche of The Mean & Moody New Guy Saving A Child Running Out In Front Of A Car. [...] Eddie spent the week ticking off the components of that great EastEnders cliche, the 'rough diamond'/silver-tongued 'ladies' man.' (See also Dennis Watts, Michael Moon, Johnny Allen, Max & Jack Branning, Steve Owen et al.)" [...] A reporter from the Metro called the character [...] "mischievous", and another from the Evening Chronicle called him [...] "a pleasant, charming character", adding [...] "It seems as if a little bit of Essex will brighten up the East End for a while. [...] s far as I can tell, [...] will be {{a breath of fresh air}} in a soap that sometimes forgets to have a laugh." ...|$|E
