5|$|Chordophones, {{which produce}} sound by {{vibrating}} {{one or more}} strings; they are sorted into according {{to the relationship between}} the string(s) and <b>the</b> <b>sounding</b> board or chamber. For example, if the strings are laid out parallel to <b>the</b> <b>sounding</b> board and there is no neck, the instrument is a zither whether it is plucked like an autoharp or struck with hammers like a piano. If the instrument has strings parallel to <b>the</b> <b>sounding</b> board or chamber and the strings extend past the board with a neck, then the instrument is a lute, whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a guitar or uses a membrane like a banjo.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1916, Canadian {{physicist}} Robert William Boyle {{and other}} scientists of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research which ultimately {{led to the development}} of sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than <b>the</b> <b>sounding</b> lines, thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision of these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{is a star}} in the {{southern}} constellation of Pictor, the Easel, and is located {{to the west of the}} bright star Canopus. It traditionally marked <b>the</b> <b>sounding</b> line of the ship Argo Navis, before the constellation was split. The star has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.861, so is visible to the naked eye under good conditions, though light pollution may result in stars dimmer than magnitude 3 being too dim to see. It is the second brightest in its constellation, exceeded only by Alpha Pictoris, which has an apparent magnitude of 3.30.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Soundings</b> podcast {{was started}} in 2013 by Dylan Haskins, a {{broadcaster}} and producer, and singer-songwriter Lisa Hannigan. The podcast revolves around Hannigan and Haskin's, two Irish expats living in London, reactions to the various “culture, books, music, theatre, films and other weird things that happen."5 Although each episode the hosts, sometimes joined by guests, discussed their opinions on recent books, films, exhibitions and plays, from the onset Haskins was clear that <b>the</b> <b>Soundings</b> was not a review show stating that “People make art to express their ideas and provoke thought and conversation, which is what this show is all about."6 <b>The</b> name <b>Soundings</b> was chosen by Hannigan as a nod to a Leaving Certificate poetry book.|$|R
5|$|Commentators {{generally}} agree that, {{to precipitate}} {{such a course}} of action as abandonment of an apparently sound and seaworthy ship, with ample provisions, some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen. In his evidence to the enquiry, Deveau ventured an explanation based on <b>the</b> <b>sounding</b> rod found on the derelict's deck. He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a sounding that, because of a malfunction of the pumps or other mishap, had given a false impression that the vessel was taking on water rapidly. A severe waterspout strike before the abandonment could explain the amount of water in the ship, and the ragged state of her rigging and sails. The low barometric pressure generated by the spout could have driven water from the bilges up into the pumps, leading the crew to assume the ship had taken on more water than she had, and was in danger of sinking.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, several U.S. Navy {{submarines}} {{were forced}} back to base to repair {{damage caused by}} cookiecutter shark bites to the neoprene boots of their AN/BQR-19 sonar domes, which caused the sound-transmitting oil inside to leak and impaired navigation. An unknown enemy weapon was initially feared, before this shark was identified as the culprit, and the problem was solved by installing fiberglass covers around the domes. In the 1980s, some thirty U.S. Navy submarines were damaged by cookiecutter shark bites, mostly to the rubber-sheathed electric cable leading to <b>the</b> <b>sounding</b> probe used to ensure safety when surfacing in shipping zones. Again, the solution was to apply a fiberglass coating. Oceanographic equipment and telecommunications cables have also been damaged by this species.|$|E

25|$|A gudok {{usually had}} three strings, {{two of them}} tuned in unison and played as a drone, the third tuned a fifth higher.

25|$|The {{captain of}} the Ollie K Wilds stated that the windows of his pilot house were closed, {{and that he did}} not hear the Frosta's horn.

The morning of the accident, the windows were likely closed, and this may have prevented Auletta from hearing the Frosta's horn. Therefore, it is imperative that a lookout be designated and posted outside to listen for and relay signals from other vessels.|$|E

The rood screen is based on footings discovered in the 1950s while <b>the</b> <b>sounding</b> board, that is 17th-century in origin, was found in 1894 in a barn at Macclesfield, a nearby plantation. The single baluster and sounding board are the only original interior appointments.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} Great Bell, the belfry houses four quarter bells which play the Westminster Quarters on the quarter hours. The four quarter bells sound G, F, E, and B. They were cast by John Warner & Sons at their Crescent Foundry in 1857 (G, F and B) and 1858 (E). The Foundry was in Jewin Crescent, {{in what is}} now known as The Barbican, in the City of London. The bells are sounded by hammers pulled by cables coming from the link room—a low-ceiling space between the clock room and the belfry—where {{mechanisms}} translate the movement of the quarter train into <b>the</b> <b>sounding</b> of the individual bells.|$|E

Then, they return to the Pathi and start the panividai. The Payyan chant Ukappatippu, and the devotees repeat it. Then, they open the door of sanctum sanctorum.

25|$|On 3 November 1938, Herbert {{enrolled}} {{himself and}} his boat, the Water Gipsy, in the River Emergency Service, which was {{under the control of}} the Port of London Authority. Over the summer of 1939, he had taken part in exercises involving simulated air raid and casualty retrieval. In early September 1939, the River Emergency Service reported to their war stations, and Herbert's own crew consisted of Darcy Braddell, vice-president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Victor Pasmore, Magnus Pyke and John Pudney. At <b>the</b> <b>sounding</b> of the first air raid siren in London in 1939, the Water Gipsy was anchored off Speaker's Steps by Westminster Bridge. A number of MPs left the Commons following the sirens and cheered the Water Gipsy as the only naval vessel in sight, before saluting it.|$|E

On the slopes of Craignaught Hill was fought a singularly unusual battle between the Boyds of Kilmarnock and the Stewarts of Darnley. Sir Alan Stewart had been treacherously slain by Sir Thomas Boyd, and his son, Alexander Stewart, was determined to take revenge. Sir Thomas was surprised {{on the night of}} 9 July 1439, whilst riding past Craignaught on his way north and although outnumbered, he and his followers fought on, even taking agreed rest periods indicated by <b>the</b> <b>sounding</b> of a horn. Eventually and inevitably Sir Thomas was killed, stabbed in the back by a Stewart, and a large number of his followers were also killed.|$|E
