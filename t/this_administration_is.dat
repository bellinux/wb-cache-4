500|$|Beginning in late 2002, Gore {{began to}} {{publicly}} criticize the Bush administration. In a September 23, 2002, speech given before the Commonwealth Club of California, Gore criticized President George W. Bush and Congress for {{the rush to}} war prior to the outbreak of hostilities in Iraq. He compared this decision to the Persian Gulf War (which Gore had voted for) stating, [...] "Back in 1991, I {{was one of a}} handful of Democrats in the United States Senate to vote in favor of the resolution endorsing the Persian Gulf War [...] But look at the differences between the resolution that was voted on in 1991 and the one <b>this</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> proposing that the Congress vote on in 2002. The circumstances are really completely different. To review a few of them briefly: in 1991, Iraq had crossed an international border, invaded a neighboring sovereign nation and annexed its territory. Now by contrast in 2002, there has been no such invasion." [...] In a speech given in 2004, during the presidential election, Gore accused George W. Bush of betraying the country by using the 9/11 attacks as a justification for the invasion of Iraq. The next year, Gore gave a speech which covered many topics, including what he called [...] "religious zealots" [...] who claim special knowledge of God's will in American politics. Gore stated: [...] "They even claim that those of us who disagree with their point of view are waging war against people of faith." [...] After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Gore chartered two planes to evacuate 270 people from New Orleans and criticized the Bush administration's response to the hurricane. In 2006, Gore criticized Bush's use of domestic wiretaps without a warrant. One month later, in a speech given at the Jeddah Economic Forum, Gore criticized the treatment of Arabs in the U.S. after 9/11 stating, [...] "Unfortunately there have been terrible abuses and it's wrong [...] I do want you to know that it does not represent the desires or wishes or feelings of the majority of the citizens of my country." [...] Gore's 2007 book, The Assault on Reason, is an analysis of what Gore refers to as the [...] "emptying out of the marketplace of ideas" [...] in civic discourse during the Bush administration. He attributes this phenomenon to the influence of television and argues that it endangers American democracy. By contrast, Gore argues, the Internet can revitalize and ultimately [...] "redeem the integrity of representative democracy." [...] In 2008, Gore argued against the ban of same-sex marriage on his Current TV website, stating, [...] "I think that gay men and women ought to have the same rights as heterosexual men and women to make contracts, have hospital visiting rights, and join together in marriage." [...] In a 2009 interview with CNN, Gore commented on former Vice President Dick Cheney's criticism of the Obama administration. Referring to his own previous criticism of the Bush administrations, Gore stated: [...] "I waited two years after I left office to make statements that were critical, and then of the policy [...] You know, you talk about somebody that shouldn't be talking about making the country less safe, invading a country that did not attack us and posed no serious threat to us at all." ...|$|E

6000|$|But {{it takes}} a great party to govern Great Britain--no clique, no faction, no cabal, can govern the forty {{millions}} of people who live in this island. It takes a vast concentration of forces to make a governing instrument. You have now got a Radical and democratic governing instrument, and if <b>this</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>is</b> broken, that instrument will be shattered. It has been recreated painfully and laboriously after twenty years by courage and fidelity. It has come into being--it is here. It is now at work, and by legislation and by the influence which it can exercise throughout the whole world, it is making even our opponents talk our language, making all parties in the State think of social reform, and concern themselves with social and domestic affairs. Beware how you injure that great instrument, as Mr. Gladstone called it--or weaken it at a moment when the masses of this country have need of it. Why, what would happen, if this present Government were to perish? On its tomb would be written: [...] "Beware of social reform. The labouring classes will not support a Government engaged in social reform. Every social reform will cost you votes. Beware of social reform. 'Learn to think Imperially.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|Colbert {{ended the}} {{monologue}} specifically directed at Bush by parodying his energy policy. He then used Laura Bush's reading initiative {{as a springboard}} to mock-criticize books for being [...] "elitist", and harshly criticized the White House Press Corps—hosts of the event—and the media in general. Addressing the audience, he remarked: Over the last five years, you people were so good—over tax cuts, WMD intelligence, the effect of global warming. We Americans didn't want to know, and you had the courtesy {{not to try to}} find out, ... And then you write, ... "Oh, they're just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic." [...] First of all, that is a terrible metaphor. <b>This</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> not sinking. <b>This</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> soaring. If anything, they are rearranging the deck chairs on the Hindenburg! ...|$|E

"What I {{found in}} discussions with current and former members of <b>this</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> {{that there is no}} {{agreed-upon}} strategic view of the Iraq problem or the region. ... fter thoughtful discussions with people both in and outside of this administration, I concluded that the current Washington decision-making process lacks a linkage to a broader view of the region and how the parts fit together strategically." ...|$|E

50|$|By October 1915, the German Army had {{advanced}} {{so far to}} the east, that Central Poland could be put under a civil <b>administration.</b> <b>This</b> <b>administration</b> <b>was</b> divided between the German Government General of Warsaw and the Austro-Hungarian Government General of Lublin.

50|$|<b>This</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> {{noteworthy}} for Seay's {{success in}} reducing taxes while increasing {{social services and}} running state government in the black.

However, controversies were unavoidable as they encountered landlords openly harassing peasants with guns and forcing them out of the lands.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2009 US Attorney General Eric Holder {{assigned}} eight experienced criminal {{prosecutors to}} build the best criminal case they could against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his co-conspirators. His prosecutors, Holder said, had “constructed a case that uses materials and evidence that does not derive from the techniques that were controversial,” which would “maximize our chances for success.” It was a driving concern to Holder that the case not rest on torture. “It’s a statement about what <b>this</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>is</b> about,” he said. “It’s a statement about this Attorney General. We {{are not going to}} use the products of interrogation techniques that this President has banned.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the 2012-2013 season, Robinson {{characterized}} {{his squad}} as [...] "probably {{the best team}} I've had." [...] But the Beavers went {{in the opposite direction}} by suffering one of their worst seasons ever, with a penchant for second-half collapses and end-of-game failures. Attendance at Gill Coliseum fell to half capacity, and the student section lost enthusiasm. The team finished with a dead-last 4-14 record in the conference and a 14-18 mark overall. Fans began calling for a change in coaches, but the university athletic director said, [...] "Coach Robinson is our coach, and <b>this</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> in full support of him." [...] Following the season, Robinson appeared on the CBS Sports Network as a studio analyst during the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship tournament.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} is the Guilty Knowledge Test (GKT), or the Concealed Information Test, {{which is used}} in Japan. The administration of this test is given to prevent potential errors that may arise from the questioning style. The test is usually conducted by a tester with {{no knowledge of the}} crime or circumstances in question. The administrator tests the participant on their knowledge of the crime that would not be known to an innocent person. For example: [...] "Was the crime committed with a [...]45 or a 9 mm?" [...] The questions are in multiple choice and the participant is rated on how they react to the correct answer. If they react strongly to the guilty information, then proponents of the test believe that it is likely that they know facts relevant to the case. <b>This</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> considered more valid by supporters of the test because it contains many safeguards to avoid the risk of the administrator influencing the results.|$|E
2500|$|The Ramos {{administration}} basically served {{its role}} as the carrier of the momentum of reform and as an important vehicle in [...] "hastening the pace of liberalization and openness in the country". The <b>administration</b> <b>was</b> a proponent of capital account liberalization, which made the country more open to foreign trade, investments, and relations. It <b>was</b> during <b>this</b> <b>administration</b> when the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas <b>was</b> established, and <b>this</b> <b>administration</b> <b>was</b> also when the Philippines joined the World Trade Organization and other free trade associations such as the APEC. During the <b>administration,</b> debt reduction <b>was</b> also put into consideration and as such, the issuance of certain government bonds called Brady Bonds also came to fruition in 1992. Key negotiations with conflicting forces in Mindanao actually became more successful during the administration, which also highlighted the great role and contributions of Jose Almonte as the key adviser of <b>this</b> liberal <b>administration.</b>|$|R
50|$|It was {{a period}} of {{violence}} and political turmoil with strong foreign influence exerted on Iraqi politics.

5000|$|...

Manson noticed that the incident was featured on the USA Today cover for three days in a row with no mention of the Iraq war. Manson felt the media [...] "was only focusing on Janet’s beautiful tit, which I thought was bizarre". The singer declared that there are [...] "a lot worse things to have your children see on TV that parents are happily plopping their kids down in front of", and thus she wrote a song [...] "sort of dealing with that and dealing with the idea that <b>this</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> really clamping down on reproductive rights and stuff like that.

5000|$|Steven Mazzone (born 1964) is an American mobster {{believed}} to be a high ranking member of the Philadelphia crime family. Mazzone's rise in power through the Philadelphia underworld began as a protege of former boss turned informant, Ralph Natale. After the family was decimated by prosecutions during the Nicodemo Scarfo and John Stanfa eras, Natale was released from prison in 1994 and shortly thereafter became the new boss of the crime family. Natale partnered with the [...] "Young Turks" [...] faction {{that was one of the}} few remnants left of the Philadelphia crime family, and their leader, Joseph [...] "Skinny Joey" [...] Merlino. After Natale assumed the top position as boss, he positioned Merlino as underboss and Ronald Turchi as the consigliere in the new hierarchy. <b>This</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> still in question to this day, as many now believe that Merlino was running the family behind the scenes, letting Natale have the boss position to deter law enforcement from himself.|$|E
5000|$|President Keeley {{appointed}} a special representative {{to gather information}} relating to a merger with Long Grove.

[...] "In light of the facts mentioned above, I feel that though we have won the battle of Brickman, we have lost the war for self preservation and home rule. I feel that your part in <b>this</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> a failure if you condone the merger with Long Grove. I cannot and will not be part of such a movement. Therefore, with sincere regret and much sorrow, I herewith submit my resignation as President of the Village of Kildeer." [...] Records show President Keeley served out his four-year term and the merger with Long Grove obviously did not occur. It must be assumed the majority of the village board supported their President's position and convinced him to withdraw his resignation, but the issue would be sensitive to some for many years to come.|$|E
