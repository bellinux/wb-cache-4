5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence and produced by Caleb Dewart of DNA Inc. The video deals directly with the lyrics' theme of Stefani's search for inspiration in songwriting. It opens with a lengthy non-musical section in which Stefani arrives in Los Angeles off of No Doubt's Rock Steady Tour. She receives several calls from Interscope label head Jimmy Iovine, who attempts <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>her</b> forward with her solo debut project, but she replies that she is tired and uninspired. After a failed studio attempt, Stefani sees a flyer advertising help for writer's block. Upon arrival she is asked {{to fill out a}} suspicious questionnaire, where the camera pans to the questions which will be important. She is then told that she will be billed when she is finished. She asks for clarification only to discover that she is already back in the studio by herself. When Stefani picks up an oversized pocket watch from the piano, a rabbit knick-knack that she had previously seen jumps across the room. She throws the watch at the knick-knack, causing her to fall back on her chair and find herself transported to a fantasy world based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass.|$|E
25|$|With Augustus {{being the}} father of only one {{daughter}} (Julia the Elder by Scribonia), Livia revealed herself to be an ambitious mother and soon started <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>her</b> own sons Tiberius and Nero Claudius Drusus into power. Drusus was a trusted general and married Augustus's favourite niece, Antonia Minor, and had three children: the popular general Germanicus, Livilla, and the future emperor Claudius. Tiberius married Augustus' daughter Julia the Elder in 11 BC and was ultimately adopted by his stepfather in AD 4 and named as Augustus' heir.|$|E
25|$|Kanepi {{builds up}} her game around her {{powerful}} groundstrokes. Her serve {{is considered to}} be one of the strongest on the WTA tour. Kanepi frequently hits 170km/h to 180km/h serves. She generally serves for power and tries to hit the lines but sometimes hits a powerful body serve <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>her</b> opponents behind the baseline. But sometimes her serve can break down which affects her game. In 2008, she began to improve her volleying skills and under her coach Luca Appino begun to use sliced backhand more often thus making her playing more versatile.|$|E

In the storyline where she is to be Riser Phoenix's fiancee, she resigns her Rating Game against him in order to save Issei; however, after Issei subsequently defeats Riser, she kisses him and moves into his family's home. She does not mind being intimate with Issei, but gets upset when other girls want to steal him away. Later, Rias' mother, Venelana, encourages her <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>her</b> relationship further with Issei (in which Rias would attempt to seduce Issei), but gets upset when Issei could not call her by her name. Eventually, Issei finally professes his love for her and calls Rias by her first name instead of her President title. She cries tears of joy and tells him that she feels the same way and the two officially become a couple. Though it seems none of the other girls (Akeno, Xenovia, Asia, Koneko, Irina, Rossweisse and Ravel) have given up on Issei. She has also shown more tolerance towards Issei's dreams of becoming Harem King, even allowing everyone to make dates with Issei with the understanding that he will always return to her afterwards.|$|E
25|$|One such grand {{residence}} is {{the marble}} and limestone Patterson Mansion at 15Dupont Circle. This Italianate mansion, the only {{survivor of the}} many mansions that once ringed the circle, was built in 1901 by New York architect Stanford White for Robert Patterson, editor of the Chicago Tribune, and his wife Nellie, heiress to the Chicago Tribune fortune. Upon Mrs.Patterson's incapacitation in the early 1920s, the house passed {{into the hands of}} her daughter, Cissy Patterson, who made it a hub of Washington social life. The house served as temporary quarters for President and Mrs.Calvin Coolidge in 1927 while the White House underwent renovation. The Coolidges welcomed Charles Lindbergh as a houseguest after his historic transatlantic flight. Lindbergh made several public appearances at the house, waving to roaring crowds from the second-story balcony, and befriended the Patterson Family, with whom he increasingly came to share isolationist and pro-German views. Cissy Patterson later acquired the Washington Times-Herald (sold to Washington Post in 1954) and declared journalistic warfare on Franklin D. Roosevelt from 15Dupont Circle, continuing throughout World WarII <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>her</b> policies, which were echoed in the New York Daily News, run by her brother Joseph Medill Patterson, and the Chicago Tribune, run by their first cousin, Colonel Robert R.

500|$|What makes [...] "Ray Of Light" [...] one of Madonna's best singles is {{the fact}} that it is such a bitch to sing. Filled with {{multiple}} octave changes, it forced Madonna <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>her</b> vocal as far as it could possibly go. The song demanded she make use of her upper register and hold notes longer than she ever had before. It really is a techno gem that is always a standout at her concerts. After hearing a sample of it for the first time in the spring of 1998, I just knew that Madonna had outdone herself. The song brings the entire album of to a whole new level.|$|E

500|$|... "The Coup" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} Paul Lieberstein, who plays series regular Toby Flenderson, and was directed by executive producer and series creator Greg Daniels. Several cast members believed the episode contains Shakespearean themes, in particular elements of the Macbeth character Lady Macbeth in Angela's storyline. Lady Macbeth was depicted as an ambitious woman who [...] "exerted an evil influence over her husband," [...] characteristics that fit with Angela attempting <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>her</b> lover, Dwight, into power. In her weekly blog for TV Guide, actress Kate Flannery previewed the episode, [...] "Behind every great man is a pushy woman. Or in this case, a pushy, short, judgmental blonde named Angela.

Located near Brașov in southern Transylvania and given {{to her as a}} gift in 1920 by grateful local officials, she had it restored over the next seven years. The other was Balchik, where she had built a palace and a small chapel called Stella Maris and tended to her garden. She also visited Ileana and her children in Austria. Ileana rarely received permission from Carol to visit Romania; this irritated Marie greatly. She also spent some time in Belgrade with her daughter [...] "Mignon" [...] and her son-in-law, King Alexander. In 1934, Marie visited England once again, meeting the Duchess of York, later Queen Elizabeth, by whom she was enchanted.|$|E

[...] In November, Deller called the storyline between Sunny, Zeke and Robin [...] "ludicrous" [...] and she was placed at number one of the [...] "soap characters we love to hate" [...] list.

500|$|The {{album was}} {{primarily}} recorded at Sigma Sound Studios in New York City. Madonna {{opted not to}} work with either Kamins or Bray, but chose Reggie Lucas, a Warner Bros. producer. Bray decided <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>her</b> in the musical direction of pop, and recorded the song [...] "Burning Up" [...] with her. However, Madonna still {{did not have enough}} material to generate a full album. The songs available were, [...] "Lucky Star", a new version of [...] "Ain't No Big Deal", [...] "Think of Me" [...] and [...] "I Know It". Lucas brought another two songs to the project, [...] "Physical Attraction" [...] and [...] "Borderline". As he recorded the tracks he deviated considerably from the original versions of the demos. One such altered song was [...] "Lucky Star". The song was written by Madonna for Kamins, who previously promised to play the track at Danceteria.

On 23 July, her trial began with prosecutor Lyall Thompson charging that Winehouse acted with [...] "deliberate and unjustifiable violence" [...] while appearing to be under the influence of alcohol or another substance. She testified that she did not punch Flash, but tried <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>her</b> away because she was scared of her; she cited her worry that Flash would sell her story to a tabloid, Flash's height advantage, and Flash's [...] "rude" [...] behaviour. On 24 July, District Judge Timothy Workman ruled that Winehouse was not guilty, citing the facts that all but two of the witnesses were intoxicated at the time of the incident and that medical evidence did not show [...] "the sort of injury that often occurs when there is a forceful punch to the eye." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1938, Imogen {{had visited}} Dartington Hall, a {{progressive}} school and crafts community near Totnes in Devon, {{which had been}} founded in 1925 by Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst. [...] In 1941–42, while travelling for CEMA in Devon and Cornwall, she was invited by the Elmhirsts to make her base at Dartington. In the summer of 1942, while recuperating there, she was persuaded by Christopher Martin, the centre's administrator, to resign her CEMA role and work at Dartington. He had in mind a music course, [...] "the {{sort of thing that}} your father did in the old days at Morley College". Beginning in 1943, Imogen established [...] a one-year [...] course, initially designed to train young women to organise amateur orchestras and musical events in rural communities. Gradually it developed into a more general musical education for a broader student intake. Under Imogen's leadership the course quickly became the hub of a range of musical activities, including the foundation of an amateur orchestra: [...] "Hardly any of us could play... However bad we were, we went on". Imogen's teaching methods, heavily based on [...] "learning by doing" [...] and without formal examinations, at first disconcerted her students and puzzled the school inspectors, but eventually gained acceptance and respect. Rosamond Strode, a pupil at Dartington who later worked with Imogen at Aldeburgh, said of her approach: [...] "She knew exactly how, and when, <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>her</b> victims in at the deep end, and she knew, also, that although they would flounder and splash about at first, it wouldn't be long before... they would be swimming easily while she beamed approval from the bank".|$|E

2500|$|... was Raoul Am's female Pet of {{the highest}} {{breeding}} and Riki's only friend in Eos. Unlike most pets, she was kind to Riki {{and fell in love}} with him, which led to them having forbidden intercourse. Although Riki did cared for her, he used her as a way to test Iason's feelings and make him jealous and ruin his public image. When the affair went public, Iason punished Riki and forced him to tell Mimea the motive behind his actions over a holoscreen. However, Mimea insisted that it was made just <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>her</b> and Riki apart, and she told Riki that she will be paired to another pet by named Jana, whom she described as a sex freak with nothing but his looks and that thinking of carrying his children pained her. As Riki was silent because his pet ring was fully activated at that time and he had a hard time speaking and breathing, this led Mimea to think that he had abandoned her and calling him a coward. When Riki returned to Eos Tower after three years, Raoul replaced Mimea with a new pet, and Riki never heard what happened to her. In the first drama CD, she was voiced by Emi Shinohara and by Shiho Kawaragi in the later drama CDs and remake OVAs. In the English dub, she is voiced by Elizabeth Maxwell.|$|E
