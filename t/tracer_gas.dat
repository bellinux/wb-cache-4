A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device.|$|E

Two pairs of <b>tracer</b> <b>gases</b> were used (He, SFe) and (C 2 H 2, Freon 22). The gases of each pair share almost the same blood-gas partition coefïicient but they have different diffusive properties in the gas phase. The experiments were performed in healthy subjects at rest and at three levels of exercise (75, 150, 225 W). Each experiment started with the alveolar washin of the <b>tracer</b> <b>gases</b> by adding these gases to inspired air. This washin was continued for several minutes in order to dissolve suffìcient amounts of the <b>tracer</b> <b>gases</b> in the body tissues. Subsequently, the <b>tracer</b> <b>gases</b> were washed out. In this paper, the slopes of the alveolar plateaus are defined as the relative increase of the concentration per second. Steeper slopes were found for the heavier gases (SF 6 and Freon 22) in comparison with those for the lighter gases of the two pairs (He and C 2 H 2). This finding ma¡' be ascribed to the contribution of diffusionlimited gas mixing in the lung to the slope of the alveolar plateau. For each gas, the slope for the first expiration during washout (alveolar washout) was considerably smaller than that for the later part of washout (mixed venous u'ashout), and the difference amounts to about 560 /o and 760 /o of the slope during mixed venous washout at rest and at the highest level of exercise, respectively. As a ñrst approximation, this difference may be considered to represent the contribution to the slope of the continued gas exchange across the alveolo-capillary membrane during expiration. ln theory. this contribution can be computed from the ratio of the alveolar ventilation and alveolar volume (VA/VA), and this is confirmed by our results...|$|R

5000|$|One way {{to measure}} the {{performance}} of a naturally ventilated space is to measure the air changes per hour in an interior space.

The reference, American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard E741: Standard Test Method for Determining Air Change in a Single Zone by Means of a <b>Tracer</b> <b>Gas</b> Dilution, describes which tracer gases can be used for this kind of testing and provides information about the chemical properties, health impacts, and ease of detection.

Windows and doors are then opened and the concentration of the <b>tracer</b> <b>gas</b> in the space is measured at regular time intervals to determine the decay rate of the <b>tracer</b> <b>gas.</b> The airflow can be deduced by looking at the change in concentration of the <b>tracer</b> <b>gas</b> over time.

40|$|We {{studied the}} ratio of the expired He and SF 6 {{concentrations}} (He/SF 6) after 1 litre inspirations of a gas mixture containing 5 % of He and SF 6. Five subjects aged 49 to 60 yrs. performed the maneuvers with both inspiration and expiration at 0. 2 - 0. 41 /s or 1. 5 - 2. 0 1 /s. In all subjects separation of the <b>tracer</b> <b>gases</b> was observed, the He/SF 6 falling early to a minimum of 0. 80 ± 0. 01 (ean ± 1 SE) and increasing gradually during expiration to a minimum of 1. 08 ± 0. 01. The slope of the SF 6 alveolar plateau was 1. 45 ± 0. 09 times that for He. Computer simulations of simultaneous convection and diffusion in an axisymmetrical series lung model predicted a pattern of He/SF 6 early in expiration which corresponded qualitatively to that observed experimentally. However, the model did not predict a rising He/SF 6 ratio late in expiration. This was stimulated only by incoporation of parelle inhomogeneity with sequential emptying into the model analysis. Consideration of Taylor type dispersion and airway asymmetry did not influence the simultaneous significantly. The results suggest that differing slopes of the alveolar plateau of two <b>tracer</b> <b>gases</b> may be due to diffusion dependent concentration differences among lung units ventilated in parallel rather than due to stratification alone. © 1979.

Therefore, {{they are not}} compatible with the crowded environment of {{the intensive care unit}} (ICU) or operating theatre, where patient co-operation is typically impossible. However, it is these patients that would benefit the most from accurate estimation of cardiopulmonary variables, because of their critical condition. This paper describes the results of a collaborative development between an anesthesiologists and biomedical engineers to create a compact and non-invasive system for the measurement of cardiopulmonary variables such as lung volume, airway dead space volume, and pulmonary blood flow. In contrast with conventional methods, the compact apparatus and non-invasive nature of the proposed method allow it {{to be used in the}} ICU, as well as in general clinical settings. We propose the use of a non-invasive method, in which <b>tracer</b> <b>gases</b> are injected into the patient's inspired breath, and the concentration of the <b>tracer</b> <b>gases</b> is subsequently measured. A novel breath-by-breath tidal ventilation model is then used to estimate the value of a patient's cardiopulmonary variables.

Results from analysis of a cohort of 20 healthy volunteers (within the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust) show that the values of estimated cardiopulmonary variables from these subjects lies within the expected ranges.

Observations reveal signatures of GWs with short vertical wavelengths less than 4  km in dynamical parameters and tracer constituents, which are also correlated {{with the presence of}} thin layers of strong local enhancements of aerosol concentrations in the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere. In particular, this is evident from a case study above Ile du Levant (43. 02 ° N, 6. 46 ° E) on 26 – 29 July 2013. Observations show a strong activity of dominant mesoscale inertia GWs with horizontal and vertical wavelengths of 370 – 510  km and 2 – 3  km respectively, and periods of 10 – 13  h propagating southward at altitudes of 13 – 20  km during 27 – 28 July. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses also show evidence of mesoscale inertia GWs with similar horizontal characteristics above the eastern part of France. Ray-tracing experiments indicate the jet-front system as the main source of observed GWs.
