5|$|Gregorio Leti's Papal Nepotism, or the True Relation of the Reasons Which Impel the Popes to {{make their}} Nephews Powerful (1667) {{is one example of}} {{contemporary}} criticism of <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cardinal-nephew; Leti holds the rare distinction of having all of his publications on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum ("List of Prohibited Books"). The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913 defended <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cardinal-nephew as a necessary countermeasure to the intrigue of the old Church. According to Francis A. Burkle-Young, 15th century Popes in particular found it necessary to elevate their relatives to the College of Cardinals due to their distrust of the crown-cardinals, Roman baronial families, and Italian princely families who also populated the college.|$|E

In the Duchy of Warsaw, sejmiks elected deputies to the Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw. Similarly, sejmiks of Congress Poland elected deputies to the Sejm of Congress Poland until its abolishment in 1831. Even in the Lithuanian territories incorporated into the Russian Empire, some judicial sejmiks were allowed to elect lower court judges; {{it was the only}} elective representative institution to survive in the Lithuanian territories after the partition. In the Prussian partition there were provincial sejmiks (Provinziallandtag) and powiat sejmiks (Kreistag). Near the turn of the century, some limited local representative institutions existed in the Russian partition and Austrian partition, but they did not bear the name of sejmiks.|$|E
5|$|First-run Lassie was {{televised}} September 12, 1954 to March 24, 1973 {{with its}} first 17 seasons airing on CBS Sundays at 7:00p.m. EST. In 1971, {{in order to}} promote community-related programming among local affiliates, the Federal Communications Commission moved primetime Sundays to 8:00 P.M. EST with <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prime Time Access Rule. CBS executives felt Lassie would not be well received in a time slot other than its traditional 7:00p.m. slot, and, with the network's other family programs set, the show was canceled. (Lassie was among several shows that CBS canceled during this time period as part of a change in its target demographics.) Lassie then entered first-run syndication with Jack Wrather and Campbell's Soup still on board, and remained on the air for another two years with its final episode airing in March 1973. All totaled, 591 episodes were produced.|$|E
5|$|In 287 BC, the plebeians again seceded. To end the secession, the lex Hortensia was passed, which {{required}} that plebiscites, laws {{passed by the}} Plebeian Council, be binding on the whole Roman people. The Hortensian law resolved the last great political question of the earlier era; the electoral and legislative sovereignty of the assemblies was confirmed and would remain part of the constitution until {{the demise of the}} Republic. As a whole, the outcome of the political struggles of the early republic was to eliminate the privileged status of patricians in the constitution and grant the plebs recognition of their own officers. <b>The</b> <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Senate was also now arguably stronger, as it became a repository of former magistrates rather than a body of hereditary nobles.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of {{the passage of the}} Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the West Virginia Legislature at Wheeling passed an act abolishing slavery in West Virginia on February 3, 1865, thus ending <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plantation in West Virginia. Since the 1960s, many of West Virginia's plantation houses have acquired places on the National Register of Historic Places, the United States government's official list of sites, buildings, and structures deemed worthy of preservation. The house at Traveller's Rest, near Kearneysville, is West Virginia's sole plantation house designated as a National Historic Landmark for its national-level historical significance. As of 2015, the majority of West Virginia's plantation houses remain under private ownership.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} to follow, public revelations {{on the state of}} Charles and Diana's {{marriage}} continued. Even though support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher {{than at any time in}} living memory, republicanism was still a minority viewpoint, and the Queen herself had high approval ratings. Criticism was focused on <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monarchy itself and the Queen's wider family rather than her own behaviour and actions. In consultation with her husband and the Prime Minister, John Major, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, and her private secretary, Robert Fellowes, she wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995, saying that a divorce was desirable.|$|E

Two years later, he joined the Australian contingent of Victoria Cross recipients who attended the parade in London's Hyde Park to commemorate the centenary of <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Victoria Cross. On 30 June 1961, Ingram died of coronary vascular disease at his home in Hastings, Victoria, and was buried at Frankston Cemetery. He is commemorated by a street name in Canberra.|$|E
