5|$|Harding's {{attitude}} toward business was {{that government should}} aid {{it as much as}} possible. He was suspicious of organized labor, viewing it as a conspiracy against business. He sought to get <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> together at a conference on unemployment that he called to meet in September 1921 at Hoover's recommendation. Harding warned in his opening address that no federal money would be available. No important legislation came as a result, though some public works projects were accelerated.|$|E
5|$|Labor {{was always}} in short supply. The most common {{solution}} was indentured servitude of young whites. These were teenagers in Britain or Germany whose parents arranged for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for families in the colonies until age 21, {{in exchange for their}} ocean passage. The great majority became farmers or farm wives. By the mid-eighteenth century, African American slaves comprised 12% of the population of New York.

5|$|Most French {{prisoners of}} war were not held in camps {{for most of the}} war, but instead, over 93 percent of French {{prisoners of war}} lived and worked on Kommandos of work details.

5|$|The {{spandrel}} {{plates were}} welded to the columns {{to create the}} modular pieces off-site at the fabrication shop. The modular pieces were typically 52inches (1.3m) deep, and extended for two full floors and half of two more floors. Adjacent modules were bolted together, with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and spandrels. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> together in resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.|$|E
5|$|After year-long {{expectations}} that the ninth season {{would be the}} series' last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season. The series' creative team {{did not want to}} extend negotiations into the next year, and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth-season episodes and a potential series finale. NBC agreed to pay $10million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth-season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series. Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series. The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on outside projects.|$|E
5|$|Amid their {{prolific}} reggae output as sessions musicians, solo artists, {{and production}} duo, Sly and Robbie—drummer Sly Dunbar and bassist Robbie Shakespeare—opened their own record label Taxi Records and attained a distribution deal with Island Records {{during the early}} 1980s. After Island founder and executive Chris Blackwell hired <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with singer Grace Jones, the duo developed a more sparse, robotic production style with funk and dub influences. This deviated from their past reggae work, {{as well as the}} genre's roots sound and light rhythms. Sly and Robbie recorded primarily at Blackwell's Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas with state-of-the-art equipment, which led to Dunbar's experimentation with electronic drums and drum machines.|$|E

When those who lived within two miles were asked what would persuade <b>them</b> <b>to</b> walk <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> approximately 60 per cent saw time or distance as the greatest barrier. A change in their personal circumstances such as their childcare responsibilities was nominated by 11 per cent as their most important requirement. Sixteenper cent stated that nothing would persuade <b>them</b> <b>to</b> walk <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> When those who lived within five miles were asked what would persuade <b>them</b> <b>to</b> cycle <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> approximately one third saw distance as the greatest barrier. Only 6 per cent gave less risk of an accident as their main reason, and 25 per cent stated that nothing would persuade <b>them</b> <b>to</b> cycle <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> The implications {{of the results of}} the survey for employers and others interested in health pro-motion and environmental awareness are discussed...|$|R

While at her office, Grace learns that Will is sick. She goes home to attend to him and is {{surprised}} to see Val there. Grace tells her that since she is home that Val can go. Val, however, does not leave. This results in the two fighting. The fight, however, is broken by Will and tells <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> the situation out.

5|$|Augie March {{returned}} to the studio in 2004 to record a follow-up to Strange Bird. The band worked with two producers, Paul McKercher and Eric Drew Feldman, and recorded in Melbourne, San Francisco, and their own studio in Nagambie, Victoria. Donovan said it was more suited to the band's style; as they co-produced on all their albums, they took {{a great deal of}} interest in production. He said it also enabled <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at their own pace, hence the four-year gap between releases. They released a DVD, Drones & Vapid Ditties, containing live performances and music videos, in mid-2004. The band's upcoming album, according to Triple J, was inspired by the streets of Melbourne. Upon completion of the initial recording sessions of Moo, You Bloody Choir, there was a six-month delay before release, as Augie March meticulously added finishing touches to it. In March 2006, the album was finally released.|$|E
5|$|Famicom's owner, Nintendo, once {{claimed that}} it would be {{impossible}} for their console to be decoded. Using the information the Ultimate Play the Game team learnt from Rare, the team prepared several tech demos and showed them to the Nintendo executive Minoru Arakawa in Kyoto. Impressed with their efforts, Nintendo decided to grant the Ultimate Play the Game team an unlimited budget for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on games for the Famicom platform. After they returned to England, they moved from Ashby-de-la-Zouch to Twycross, and established a new studio through Rare. They set their headquarters in a Manor Farmhouse. Rare also set up another company known as Rare, Inc., in Miami, Florida. Headed by Joel Hochberg, the American company was involved in maintaining Rare's operation in the US and contacting major US publishers. Famicom was eventually released in the UK under the name Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).|$|E

As a result of the probe, in 2010 the Common Council decided to delay her reappointment as commissioner until the investigation concluded. She had been serving in an interim capacity. In April 2011, Perrin-Johnson resigned her position.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium was {{delivered}} to Los Alamos {{in the form of}} what was found to be a mixture of plutonium trifluoride (PuF3) and plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF4). Work with plutonium was carried out in gloveboxes for safety reasons. The metallurgists figured out how to purify the plutonium, and found that heating it to 250° allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> it in the malleable γ phase. It was also found that alloying it with 3 percent gallium would stabilize it in the δ phase. When plutonium at last began to arrive in quantity from the Hanford Site in February 1945, they were ready for production. In a race against the clock, the metallurgists produced plutonium spheres for the Trinity nuclear test by July 23, 1945.|$|E
