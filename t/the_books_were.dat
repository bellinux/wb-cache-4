5|$|The Hardy Boys {{have gone}} through many {{permutations}} over the years. Beginning in 1959, <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>were</b> extensively revised, and some commentators find that the Hardys' characters changed in the process. Commentators also sometimes see differences between the Hardy Boys of the original Hardy Boys Mystery Stories and the Hardy Boys of the Hardy Boys Casefiles or the new Undercover Brothers series.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} to legalize birth control {{came to a}} gradual conclusion around the time Planned Parenthood was formed. In 1942, there were over 400 birth control organizations in America, contraception was fully embraced by the medical profession, and the anti-contraception Comstock laws (which still remained on <b>the</b> <b>books)</b> <b>were</b> rarely enforced.|$|E

5000|$|The 'Final Postscript' in <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> a page {{dedicated}} to his cat 'Freddie', who died as <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>was</b> {{in its final}} stages. The last words in <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>are</b> [...] "That ownership, my friend, is joy".|$|R
5|$|When the {{drafts of}} <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>were</b> shown to De Beers they objected {{to a number}} of areas and {{threatened}} an injunction against Fleming and The Sunday Times, which resulted in much material being removed. The Sunday Times serialised the book over six weeks, starting on 15 September 1957 and finishing on 20 October 1957.|$|E
5|$|Wright's career {{came to an}} end in 1688 {{with the}} {{expulsion}} of King James II during the Glorious Revolution. He seems to have accepted the inevitable end of his royal favour with the accession to the throne of the Protestant William of Orange. He lived on, in relative poverty, for a further six years until 1694. In March of that year, he made a will leaving his house in St Paul's parish to his niece Katherine Vaux. His collection of drawings, prints and books were left to his nephew, the painter Michael Wright; however a codicil to the will stated that <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>were</b> to be sold on behalf of his son Thomas, who was then abroad. <b>The</b> <b>books</b> <b>were</b> auctioned on 4 June and on 1 August 1694, John Michael Wright was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} the manuscript for Casino Royale, Fleming showed the manuscript {{to his friend}} (and later editor) William Plomer to read. Plomer liked it and submitted it to the publishers, Jonathan Cape, who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 {{on the recommendation of}} Fleming's older brother Peter, an established travel writer. Between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve novels and two short-story collections were published, with the last two books – The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights – published posthumously. All <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>were</b> published in the UK through Jonathan Cape.|$|E
5000|$|In the Socialist Review <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>was</b> praised {{while in}} the Financial Times <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>was</b> criticised as [...] "conspiratorial" [...] and an [...] "examination of the frustrations of the radical left".

5|$|Heyer's {{earliest}} {{works were}} romance novels, most set before 1800. In 1935, she released Regency Buck, {{her first novel}} set in the Regency period. This bestselling novel essentially established the genre of Regency romance. Unlike other romance novels of the period, Heyer's novels used the setting as a plot device. Many of her characters exhibited modern-day sensibilities; more conventional characters in the novels would point out the heroine's eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love. <b>The</b> <b>books</b> <b>were</b> set almost entirely {{in the world of}} the wealthy upper class and only occasionally mention poverty, religion, or politics.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} table, the years {{correspond to the}} year of the award ceremonies; <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>were</b> all first published before the founding of the awards in 1998.

Entries in bold and with a lavender background were inducted into the Hall of Fame that year; those that are neither highlighted nor in bold were not inducted that year (NI), but may be inducted later (IL). Superscript letters after the result indicate simultaneous nominations in other categories.|$|E
5|$|Originally The Tales of Beedle the Bard {{had only}} been {{produced}} in {{a limited number of}} seven handmade copies, all handwritten and illustrated by the author herself. <b>The</b> <b>books</b> <b>were</b> bound in brown morocco leather, and decorated with hand-chased silver ornaments and mounted semiprecious stones by silversmith and jeweller Hamilton & Inches of Edinburgh. Each of the silver pieces represents one of the five stories in the book. Rowling also asked that each of the seven copies be embellished using a different semiprecious stone.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>book</b> <b>was</b> commercially successful. By October 2006, <b>the</b> <b>book</b> {{went through}} three printings. Although <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>was</b> banned in Thailand, {{samizdat}} photocopies of <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>were</b> available {{for sale in}} the Tha Phrachan area of Bangkok. Unauthorized translations of sections of <b>the</b> <b>book</b> appeared on several websites, although some sites were blocked by censors.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>book</b> <b>was</b> first {{published}} in English in April 1973.

5|$|Rand and Robyn Miller both {{wanted to}} develop Mysts back story into novels. After {{the success of}} Myst, {{publisher}} Hyperion signed a three-book, US$1 million deal with the brothers. David Wingrove worked from the Miller brothers' story outlines. The three books, entitled Myst: The Book of Atrus, Myst: The Book of Ti'ana, and Myst: The Book of D'ni, were released in 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>books</b> <b>were</b> later packaged together as The Myst Reader. A fourth novel, entitled Myst: The Book of Marrim, is planned.|$|E
5|$|Some lessons {{identified}} in the series include diversity, acceptance, political tolerance, and equality. Surveys of over 1,000 college students in the United States show that those who read <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>were</b> significantly different {{than those who had}} not. Readers of the series were found to be more tolerant, more opposed to violence and torture, less authoritarian, and less cynical. Although it is not known if this is a cause-and-effect relationship, there is a clear correlation, and it seems that Harry Potter's cultural impact may be stronger than just a fandom bond.|$|E
5|$|The record-breaking {{publication}} of Half-Blood Prince {{was accompanied by}} controversy. In May 2005, bookmakers in the UK suspended bets on which main character would die in the book amid fears of insider knowledge. A number of high value bets were made {{on the death of}} Albus Dumbledore, many coming from the town of Bungay where, it was believed, <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>were</b> being printed at the time. Betting was later reopened. Additionally, in response to Greenpeace's campaign on using forest friendly paper for big-name authors, Bloomsbury published the book on 30% recycled paper.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{official}} children's <b>book</b> of <b>the</b> Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Praise for <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> {{still high}} over 70 years since its first publication, mainly for the enhancing illustrations and effective pacing. It was criticised {{for having a}} loose plot, however. <b>The</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> popular worldwide.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>book</b> <b>was</b> {{reviewed}} in Red Pepper by Trevor Evans. <b>The</b> <b>book</b> <b>was</b> reviewed by Myrto Petsota on the Counterfire website.|$|R
50|$|Folklore of Assam <b>is</b> a {{comprehensive}} <b>book</b> on Assamese folklore authored by Jogesh Das. <b>The</b> <b>book</b> <b>was</b> published by National Book Trust in 1972. <b>The</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> {{a part of}} the Folklore of India series. <b>The</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> originally written in English and then in other Indian languages.|$|R
5|$|Yeovil is the {{location}} for the fictional School of Lifemanship {{in a series of}} novels by Stephen Potter: Gamesmanship (1947), Lifemanship (1950), One-Upmanship (1952), Supermanship (1958), Anti-Woo (1965) and The Complete Golf Gamesmanship (1968). <b>The</b> <b>books</b> <b>were</b> adapted for the 1960 film School for Scoundrels, starring Alastair Sim, Terry-Thomas, Ian Carmichael and Irene Handl. Later they were adapted by Barry Took into a BBC TV comedy series called One-Upmanship (1974–78), starring Richard Briers and Peter Jones. Yeovil {{is also one of the}} three principal locations in John Cowper Powys's 1929 novel, Wolf Solent.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, Ace's output was {{approaching}} one hundred titles a year, still heavily {{dominated by the}} primary genres. Almost all <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>were</b> 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced {{an increase in the}} price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of Frank Herbert's Dune, were priced at 95 cents. With Ballantine Books, Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.|$|E
5|$|Fraser {{was working}} as a {{journalist}} on The Glasgow Herald when he wrote the first novel, Flashman; writing in the evenings, after work, he took 90hours in total to write the story. After the book was published, he left journalism and took up writing novels. When a break from writing was forced upon him by a broken arm, he abandoned the book until his wife read the manuscript and urged him to finish. He did not find a publisher for the novel for two years, until Barrie & Jenkins published it in 1969. When the novel was published in the US the same year, of the 34 reviews read by Alden Whitman of The New York Times, ten of them considered the book to be a genuine autobiography. Fraser researched each novel at Trinity College, Dublin. From their first publication, <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>were</b> a commercial success, and new editions appeared on the best-sellers' lists.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>book</b> <b>was</b> first {{published}} in English in August 1973.

5|$|In 1947, Marguerite Henry {{released}} the children's book Misty of Chincoteague, {{the first in}} a series of novels that made the Chincoteague breed internationally famous. The real Misty was foaled on Chincoteague Island in 1946, and was purchased as a weanling by Henry. In 1961, the publicity was increased even more when the film Misty was made, based on the book. The publicity generated by the books assisted the Chincoteague Fire Department and the breed in remaining viable into the 21st century. While fictionalized, <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>were</b> based on a real horse and ranch on Chincoteague Island, and the Misty of Chincoteague Foundation was established in 1990, to preserve the Beebe Ranch and establish a museum with memorabilia from the series. Model horse company Breyer Animal Creations has created models of Misty and five of her descendants. As of 2001, there were around 40 surviving descendants of Misty worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In August 1993, police raided Jackson's home and, {{according}} to court documents, found books and photographs in his bedroom featuring young boys {{with little or no}} clothing. Since <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>were</b> legal to purchase and own, the jury decided not to indict Jackson. Jordan Chandler gave police a description of Jackson's intimate parts; a strip search revealed that Jordan had correctly claimed Jackson had patchy-colored buttocks, short pubic hair, and pink and brown marked testicles. Reportedly, Jordan had also drawn accurate pictures of a dark spot on Jackson's penis only visible when his penis was lifted. Despite differing initial internal reports from prosecutors and investigators, with reports of jurors feeling that the photos did not match the description, the DA stated his belief in a sworn affidavit that the description was accurate, along with the sheriff's photographer stating the description was accurate. A 2004 motion filed by Jackson's defense asserted that Jackson was never criminally indicted by any grand jury and that his settlement admitted no wrongdoing and contained no evidence of criminal misconduct.|$|E
5|$|Lesbians {{depicted}} in literature were relatively {{rare in the}} 1950s. It was the publisher's policy in any novel involving lesbianism that the characters would never receive any satisfaction from the relationship. One or both usually ended up committing suicide, going insane, or leaving the relationship. Marijane Meaker discusses this in the 2004 foreword of Spring Fire: she was told by editor Dick Carroll that because <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>were</b> distributed by the U.S. Post Office instead of private companies delivering directly to stores, postal inspectors would send the books back to the publisher if homosexuality was depicted positively. The Postal Service relaxed their censorship after several First Amendment obscenity trials, including Roth v. United States and another regarding Allen Ginsberg's Howl in the mid-1950s, which gave Bannon a modicum of freedom in her plots. Although the ending to Odd Girl Out did not veer {{too far from the}} unsatisfactory resolution formula of Spring Fire, Women's Barracks, and Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness, it examined Laura's internal struggle in the realization that despite her femininity, she was deeply in love with another woman, and at the end she embraced it, which was rare in lesbian fiction.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>book</b> <b>was</b> first {{published}} in 2014. <b>The</b> <b>book</b> <b>was</b> officially inaugurated by Sohan Singh Thandal, Minister for Tourism, Government of Punjab.|$|R
