5|$|Durkheim saw {{religion}} {{as the most}} fundamental social institution of humankind, and one {{that gave rise to}} other social forms. It was the religion that gave humanity the strongest sense of collective consciousness. Durkheim saw the {{religion as}} a force that emerged in the early hunter and gatherer societies, as the emotions collective effervescence run high in the growing groups, forcing them to act in a new ways, and giving them a sense of some hidden force driving them. Over time, as emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a rise to the division between <b>the</b> <b>sacred</b> <b>and</b> the profane. However, Durkheim also believed that religion was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by science and the cult of an individual.|$|E
5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{identified}} several instances {{in the story}} that he argued linked to wider themes within the Adventures of Tintin. He identified a recurring host-and-guest theme in Alembick's visit to Syldavia, and believed that the theme of thieving was present in the story as Alembick's identity is stolen. Another theme identified within the series by McCarthy {{was that of the}} blurring between <b>the</b> <b>sacred</b> <b>and</b> the political; he saw echoes of this in King Ottokar's Sceptre as the King has to wait three days before appearing to the Syldavian public on St. Vladimir's Day, something that McCarthy thought linked to Jesus Christ and the Resurrection. McCarthy also opined that a number of characters in the book visually resembled Captain Haddock, a character who would be introduced in the subsequent Tintin adventure, The Crab with the Golden Claws.|$|E

25|$|In {{his work}} on the history of religion, Eliade is most highly {{regarded}} for his writings on Alchemy, Shamanism, Yoga and what he called the eternal return—the implicit belief, supposedly present in religious thought in general, that religious behavior is not only an imitation of, but also a participation in, sacred events, and thus restores the mythical time of origins. Eliade's thinking was in part influenced by Rudolf Otto, Gerardus van der Leeuw, Nae Ionescu and the writings of the Traditionalist School (René Guénon and Julius Evola). For instance, Eliade's <b>The</b> <b>Sacred</b> <b>and</b> the Profane partially builds on Otto's The Idea of the Holy to show how religion emerges from the experience of <b>the</b> <b>sacred,</b> <b>and</b> myths of time and nature.|$|E

25|$|Just as the Imām {{is seen by}} Ismailis as {{the manifestation}} of the first-created Light, during the period between the Imāmates of Muhammad ibn Ismail and al-Madhi Billah, the {{relationship}} between the teacher and the student became a sacred one, and the Dai became a position much beyond a normal missionary. The Dai passed on <b>the</b> <b>sacred</b> <b>and</b> hidden knowledge of the Imām to the student, who could then use that information to ascend to higher levels. First the student loved the Dai, and from the Dai he learned to love the Imām, who was but an interceder on behalf of God. In Nizari Ismailism, the head Dai is called the Pir.|$|E
25|$|As the {{settlements}} grew larger, {{the houses were}} arranged in two elliptical rows, separated by a space of 70–100 metres (220–320feet). Each household was almost completely self-supportive within these communities, as if instead of being located within a settlement, each family was living away from town and neighbors in the country. There {{was a lack of}} public infrastructure within these settlements, which compelled the inhabitants to include all aspects of their lives within their own domicile; ovens, kilns, working, and sleeping areas were all contained within the same space as the family’s sacred altars. Thus the buildings included both <b>the</b> <b>sacred</b> <b>and</b> profane, which some authorities see as evidence to support the idea that the inhabitants viewed their homes as living beings.|$|E

25|$|In 1402 the Confrérie had {{received}} a monopoly {{on the performance of}} religious mystery plays. Rival companies arose presenting satire and other types of comedy, and finding that these groups were attracting larger audiences than their own, the Confrérie responded by adding comic scenes and burlesques to their religious mysteries. Eventually this mix of <b>the</b> <b>sacred</b> <b>and</b> the profane came to be regarded by some as sacrilegious. After their new theatre was completed, the Confrérie petitioned the parliament of Paris for permission to commence performances. Although the parliament passed a decree of 17 November 1548 in their favor which prohibited all other groups from performing plays in Paris or its vicinity, it also prohibited the Confrérie from presenting the Passion or any other sacred subject.|$|E
25|$|The Faculty of Arts offers {{undergraduate}} major {{programs in}} immunology, international relations, and ethics, society, and law {{to students at}} the university. Associated with the latter two is an academic program called Trinity One. Admission to the Trinity One program is separate {{from that of the}} college itself, with enrollment limited to 25 students per stream. At least one prominent professor teaches in each stream; for example, Robert Bothwell in the International Relations stream Mark Kingwell in Ethics, Society, and Law. Noted author Margaret MacMillan taught in the International Relations stream for {{the first two years of}} the program, prior to her departure for Oxford. The International Relations program benefits from the presence of the Munk School of Global Affairs where Janice Stein, a prominent Canadian academic, is the current Director. The Munk School also houses notable research centres, like the Centre for South Asian Studies (a constitutive until of the Asian Institute, that hosts academic and public events focused on critical global questions of law and activism; histories and contemporary configurations of <b>the</b> <b>sacred</b> <b>and</b> secular; political economy and cultures of capitalism; media, technology and the public sphere.|$|E

500|$|In his psychoanalytical {{study of}} the Adventures of Tintin, the {{literary}} critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès believed that The Seven Crystal Balls–Prisoners of the Sun arc reflects a confrontation between civilisations, and between <b>the</b> <b>sacred</b> <b>and</b> the secular.

He then drew comparisons between the Incan Prince of the Sun and the Syldavian King Muskar XII in King Ottokar's Sceptre, noting that in both the monarch is threatened by losing a treasured cultural artefact to foreigners. Apostolidès also believed that the eclipse scene reflects {{a change in the}} power relations between the sacrificed (Tintin) and the sacrificer (the Inca prince). Commenting on Tintin's dream sequence in which he dreams of Calculus, Haddock, and the Thompsons, Apostolidès believed that it reflected a [...] "latent homosexual desire", comparing it with the dream sequence in The Crab with the Golden Claws.|$|E

[...] "Blood on the Leaves," [...] which samples Nina Simone's 1965 rendition of [...] "Strange Fruit" [...] and was the first track in the first incarnation of the track list, is an example of West's signature dichotomy in which he melds <b>the</b> <b>sacred</b> <b>and</b> profane. [...] "Strange Fruit", first recorded by Billie Holiday in 1939, brought the lynchings of black Americans to a [...] "startling poignancy," [...] creating [...] "one of the most towering, important songs of the 20th century."
