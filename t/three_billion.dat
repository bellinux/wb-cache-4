5|$|Zeta Tucanae is a yellow-white main {{sequence}} star of spectral type F9.5V and an apparent magnitude of 4.20 located 28 light-years {{away from the}} Solar System. Despite having a slightly lower mass, this star is more luminous than the Sun. The composition and mass of this star {{are very similar to}} the Sun, with a slightly lower mass and an estimated age of <b>three</b> <b>billion</b> years. The solar-like qualities make it a target of interest for investigating the possible existence of a life-bearing planet. It appears to have a debris disk orbiting it at a minimum radius of 2.3 astronomical units. As of 2009, no planet has been discovered in orbit around this star.|$|E
5|$|From about <b>three</b> <b>billion</b> years ago, prokaryotic selenoprotein {{families}} {{drive the}} evolution of selenocysteine, an amino acid. Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes as selenocysteine, where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against oxidative damage. Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells {{seem to have a}} bacterial phylogenetic origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurs in species as diverse as green algae, diatoms, sea urchin, fish, and chicken. Selenium enzymes are involved in the small reducing molecules glutathione and thioredoxin. One family of selenium-bearing molecules (the glutathione peroxidases) destroys peroxide and repairs damaged peroxidized cell membranes, using glutathione. Another selenium-bearing enzyme in some plants and in animals (thioredoxin reductase) generates reduced thioredoxin, a dithiol that serves as an electron source for peroxidases and also the important reducing enzyme ribonucleotide reductase that makes DNA precursors from RNA precursors.|$|E

5|$|The {{result of}} this process has been a steady {{increase}} in the energy output of the Sun. When the Sun first became a main sequence star, it radiated only 70% of the current luminosity. The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present, rising by 1% every 110 million years. Likewise, in <b>three</b> <b>billion</b> years the Sun {{is expected to be}} 33% more luminous. The hydrogen fuel at the core will finally be exhausted in five billion years, when the Sun will be 67% more luminous than at present. Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the luminosity reaches 121% above the present value. This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter it will pass through the subgiant stage and evolve into a red giant.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The yearly {{congestion}} {{costs in}} the U.

An effective method for reducing the delay cost in air traffic flow management is by using ground-holding policy. When numbers of flights are big, it is difficult to calculate the real-time solution of it. A new recursion event-driven model is presented in this paper considering different delay cost. Discrete-event analyze method has been used to solve the single airport ground-holding problem. The concept of delay time equivalent quantity has been presented to solve the combination optimization problem and a fast algorithm was given basing on it. The simulation results validate the feasibility of the proposed model and algorithm...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{development}} of e-education has enabled distance education {{to overcome the}} lack of interactivity inherent in earlier forms of distance education based on correspon-dence and mass media, but {{it looks as if}} it is also pushing up the costs of distance education. In the 1960 s and 1970 s, the cost structure of distance education, and its ability to lower educational costs, was seen as a distinct advantage {{in the face of the}} need to expand educational provision. With the world population forecast to grow by over <b>three</b> <b>billions</b> in the next 50 years, the need for cheap ways of educating people must be paramount. This article asks just how relevant it is to global educational needs to develop more expensive forms of distance education that, in the absence of public funding, place increased nancial burdens on the students...|$|R

40|$|Abstract　How has the consciousness, {{which is}} {{characteristically}} observed in human beings, {{developed in the}} history of evolution? The author first describds the outline of evolution, from prokaryotic cells to Homo sapience, on the basis of molecular biology. The evolution of a species becomes realized when mutations accidentally occuring in the genes are fixed for generations. Human beings, a strange creature with consciousness, is also produced as the results of fortunate accumuIation of numbers of mutations during <b>three</b> <b>billions</b> years. In the next, the evolution of the animal brains is overviewed {{from the point of view}} of comparative physiology. The causal relation between the ability of holding long term memory and the development of consciousness is discussed. Finally, the chdracteristics of the consciousness and its possible origin are discussed, introducing, the opinions of two famous Novel prize winners in the medical and physiological field, F. Crick, the discoverer of DNA model, and J. C. Eccles, the discoverer of inhibitory synapse. Crick asserts the totally material process of the brain activities including consciousness, while Eccles holds a Descartes type dualism. A hypothesis of R.

25|$|A {{variety of}} factors—ranging from inexperienced conscripts {{and a smaller}} {{industrial}} base to low population growth and obsolete military doctrines—crippled the French effort {{at the outset of}} World War II. The Germans won the Battle of France in 1940 despite the French often having better equipment than their opponents. Prior to the Battle of France, there were sentiments among many Allied soldiers, French and British, of pointless repetition; they viewed the war with dread since they had already beaten the Germans once, and images of that first major conflict were still poignant in military circles. The costs of World War I along with the now stale doctrine employed by the French Army (while the Germans were developing a doctrine which stressed initiative from junior commanders and combining different arms, the French sought to minimize casualties through a rigorously controlled type of battle and a top down command structure) forced the French to look for more defensive measures. The Maginot Line was the result of these deliberations: the French originally allocated <b>three</b> <b>billion</b> francs for the project, but by 1935 seven billion had been spent. The Maginot Line succeeded in holding off the German attack. However, while the French thought that the main weight of the German attack would arrive through central Belgium, and accordingly deployed their forces here, the assault actually came further south in the Ardennes forest. The Third Republic collapsed in the ensuing conflict.|$|E
