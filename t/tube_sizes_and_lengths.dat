A three-zone model based on the desuperheating, two-phase, and subcooling sections of a condenser could be used to estimate the performance with a good accuracy. Overall heat transfer coefficients for each of the three sections, expressed as a function of the air velocity across the condenser and refrigerant mass flow rate and the model using the elemental difference method incorporate calculations to determine the pressure drop, heat performance within the condenser and it includes physical parameters (pass, <b>tube</b> hole <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>length)</b> that can be varied to analyze potential design changes without exhaustive experimental efforts. it was found that an accuracy of heat performance was within 5 % in case of using the various condensers, the refrigerant pressure drop was predicted within 25 % and the pressure drop of air side was well matched with experiment data within 4 %...|$|R

In this study, we investigated whether the anti-angiogenic effect of pomegranate peel extract (PPE) is partly attributable to Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) activation in the Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs). Materials and Methods: Ethanol extract from PPE was prepared. HUVECs were treated in four groups (with PPE (10 μg/ml) alone, PPE with or without PPARγ (T 0070907) and α (GW 6471) antagonists, and control group). The possible effect of PPARs on angiogenic regulation was checked by Matrigel assay.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{research}} program was the investigation and application of noncontact temperature measurement techniques using optical techniques and optical fiber methods. In particular, a pyrometer utilizing an infrared optical light pipe and a multiwavelength filtering approach was designed, revised, and tested. This work was motivated {{by the need to}} measure the temperatures of small metallic pellets (approximately 3 mm diameter) in free fall at the Microgravity Materials Processing Drop Tube at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. In addition, research under this program investigated the adaptation of holography technology to optical fiber sensors, and also examined the use of rare-earth dopants in optical fibers for use in measuring temperature. The pyrometer development effort involved both theoretical analysis and experimental tests. For the analysis, a mathematical model based on radiative transfer principles was derived. Key parameter values representative of the drop tube system, such as particle <b>size,</b> <b>tube</b> diameter <b>and</b> <b>length,</b> <b>and</b> particle temperature, were used to determine an estimate of the radiant flux that will be incident on the face of an optical fiber or light pipe used to collect radiation from the incandescent falling particle. An extension of this work examined the advantage of inclining or tilting the collecting fiber to increase the time that the falling particle remains in the fiber field-of-view. Those results indicate that increases in total power collected of about 15 percent may be realized by tilting the fiber. In order to determine the suitability of alternative light pipes and optical fibers, and experimental set-up for measuring the transmittance and insertion loss of infrared fibers considered for use in the pyrometer was assembled. A zirconium fluoride optical fiber and several bundles of hollow core fiber of varying diameters were tested. A prototype two-color pyrometer was assembled and tested at Virginia Tech, and then tested on the Drop Tube at Marshall Space Flight Center. Radiation from 5 mm diameter niobium drops falling in the Drop Tube was successfully detected, and recorded for later analysis. Subsequent analysis indicated that the imaging of light output from the light pipe onto the detector active areas was not identical for both detectors...|$|R

On the other hand, on the assumption that pollinators are influencing the variation in floral traits (e. g. in pistil length) we expected lower mean phenotypic variation of pollen <b>size</b> <b>and</b> pistil <b>length</b> in pollination-specialist plants than in pollination-generalist ones. A positive correlation between pollen <b>size</b> <b>and</b> pistil <b>length</b> was found for the set of species, but not between the CVs of these traits. This trend was maintained when pollination-specialist plants were analyzed separately, but no statistical significance was obtained for the correlation in pollination-generalist plants. Contrary to our expectations, pollination-specialist plants did not show less mean intraspecific variation in floral traits than pollination-generalist plants. Therefore, the relationship between pollen <b>size</b> <b>and</b> pistil <b>length</b> among species suggests that the pollination system may be of less importance as a selective force than flower functionality...|$|R

40|$|Available online 9 May 2014 International audienceDiffusion MRI tractography {{is often}} used to {{estimate}} structural connections between brain areas and there is a fast-growing interest in quantifying these connections based on their position, shape, <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>length.</b> However, a portion of the connections reconstructed with tractography is biased by their position, shape, <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>length.</b> Thus, connections reconstructed are not equally distributed in all white matter bundles. Quantitative measures of connectivity based on the streamline distribution in the brain such as streamline count (density), average <b>length</b> <b>and</b> spatial extent (volume) are biased by erroneous streamlines produced by tractography algorithms. In this paper, solutions are proposed to reduce biases in the streamline distribution. First, we propose to optimize tractography parameters in terms of connectivity. Then, we propose to relax the tractography stopping criterion with a novel probabilistic stopping criterion and a particle filtering method, both based on tissue partial volume estimation maps calculated from a T 1 -weighted image. We show that optimizing tractography parameters, stopping and seeding strategies can reduce the biases in position, shape, <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>length</b> of the streamline distribution. These tractography biases are quantitatively reported using in-vivo and synthetic data. This is a critical step towards producing tractography results for quantitative structural connectivity analysis...|$|R
