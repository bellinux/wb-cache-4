5|$|According to {{customary}} law, noblemen {{could not}} be sued outside the province until the 15thcentury. King Louis I even prohibited all prelates and noblemen who owned lands in Transylvania from bringing legal proceedings of lesser importance concerning these estates to the royal court. Nevertheless, legal actions between Transylvanians and the inhabitants of {{other parts of the}} kingdom remained outside the jurisdiction of the voivodes. Litigants could appeal to the royal court against the decision of the voivode from the 14thcentury, but the voivode often remained involved in the proceedings. Legislation prescribed <b>that</b> <b>appeals</b> against decisions of the voivodes were to be addressed to the judge royal only from 1444.|$|E
5|$|Cordray {{was granted}} a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that lower courts could not grant a stay of {{execution}} for a death row inmate. At the same time, Fisher, Cordray's boss, sought a referendum to mandate <b>that</b> <b>appeals</b> in death penalty cases be made directly to the Supreme Court. In 1994 the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Steffen v. Tate (39 F.3d 622 1994) limited death row inmates to a single federal appeal and said that federal courts cannot stay an execution if the case is still in a state court.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the policy}} of the Australian Labor Party from 1908 <b>that</b> <b>appeals</b> to the Privy Council should be abolished, it took no {{legislative}} action to implement that policy, and appeals to the Privy Council never became a major political issue. There were calls among lawyers and academics in the 1950s for the abolition of such appeals, however there was no legislative response until 1968, abolishing appeals in matters involving federal legislation, 1975, abolishing almost all appeals from the High Court, and 1986 which abolished appeals from State Courts.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the next}} {{parliamentary}} sitting after this incident occurred, Rhodes tabled a bill that he had drafted that was the shortest {{in the history of the}} House. It stated that all civil cases were to be tried by magistrates and <b>that</b> <b>appeals</b> could be launched to the chief magistrate of the territory with an assessor. Criminal cases were to be tried before supreme court judges on circuit. The bill passed with the effect that, inasmuch as the magistrates practised according to native law, that native marriage customs and laws, including polygamy, were legalised in the colony.|$|E

25|$|On January 16, 1997, Ennis Cosby {{was killed}} near Interstate 405 in Los Angeles, California. Cosby, {{the son of}} comedian Bill Cosby, {{was shot in the}} head by 18-year-old Mikhail Markhasev in a failed robbery attempt. Cosby's death {{resulted}} in significant media coverage, public outrage and an outpouring of support for the Cosby family. Seeking the $100,000 reward offered by the National Enquirer, an acquaintance of the shooter provided information that led to Markhasev's arrest in March 1997. Subsequently, Markhasev was tried and convicted of first-degree murder and attempted robbery on July 7, 1998, and was sentenced to life in prison the following month. Markhasev maintained his innocence until 2001, when he admitted to committing the murder and asked <b>that</b> <b>appeals</b> in his case stop.|$|E
25|$|The appellate {{tribunal}} {{is known}} as the tribunal of second instance. Normally the second instance tribunal is the tribunal of the metropolitan bishop. In the case where the appeal is from a first instance decision of the metropolitan's own tribunal, the appeal is taken to a court which the metropolitan designated with approval of the Holy See, usually another nearby metropolitan, thus ensuring <b>that</b> <b>appeals</b> from one diocese are never heard by the same diocese. As an example, a case in the Diocese of Springfield, Massachusetts would be appealed to the tribunal of the Archdiocese of Boston, but a case originating in the Archdiocese of Boston would be appealed to the tribunal of the Archdiocese of New York, by agreement between the archbishops of New York and Boston.|$|E

25|$|The {{limitless}} {{nature of}} {{appeals to the}} House of Lords {{was the cause of}} much concern, involving an additional set of expensive and time-consuming appeals from the Court of Appeal that could not necessarily set decisions down in the knowledge that they were final. The appeals from the County Courts were seen similarly, involving an appeal to the High Court of Justice and the bypassing of the Court of Appeal for a second set of appeals to the Lords. The Administration of Justice (Appeals) Act 1934, a short statute, solved both problems neatly by abolishing the appeal of County decisions to the High Court and instead sending them automatically to the Court of Appeal, and by establishing <b>that</b> <b>appeals</b> to the Lords could only take place with the consent of the Court of Appeal or the Lords themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{scheduling}} of Panorama has, {{since the}} 1980s, often been {{a subject of}} media debate and controversy, due to {{the duties of the}} BBC to provide both on the one hand entertaining programming <b>that</b> <b>appeals</b> to a mass audience, and on the other serious journalism that might have a narrower audience. In February 1985, with the programme being watched by an average audience of just 3.5million viewers, Controller of BBC One Michael Grade moved the programme from its traditional prime time 8.10pm slot on Monday evenings back to 9.30pm, after the Nine O'Clock News. Despite many protests about this move in the media, Panorama remained in this slot until 1997, although two of Grade's successors, Alan Yenotob and Michael Jackson, were known to be unhappy about running 70 continuous minutes of news from 9pm. In May 1997 the Acting Controller of BBC One, Mark Thompson, did move Panorama back half an hour to 10pm, {{to make way for the}} sitcom Birds of a Feather, which opened the BBC to criticism that it was side-lining serious content in favour of lighter programming.|$|E
25|$|Because of her {{participation}} in the musical, {{it took a long}} time for Beni to release new material. When the musical stopped touring in 2006, she began modeling as the face of Cecil McBee, one of the largest and most popular Japanese clothing lines <b>that</b> <b>appeals</b> to teenage and college girls. She was also the host of the NHK fashion program, Tokyo Kawaii TV, where Beni discusses the latest fashion trends in Japan. When she became the face of Orion Beer a new single was announced to be released on September 20. Her seventh single was named How Are U?. This single was her first single not to chart on the Oricon chart and is considered a total flop. Her eighth single named Luna was an ending theme song for the Japanese drama Warui Yatsura. This single charted at the No. 77 spot making it a small comeback from Beni. On April 25, 2007, Beni released her third studio album named Gem. The album charted at the No. 114 place on the Oricon chart.|$|E

25|$|Aegina {{had always}} {{been exposed to the}} raids of corsairs and had oppressive {{governors}} during these last 30years of Venetian rule. Venetian nobles were not willing to go to this island. In 1533, three rectors of Aegina were punished for their acts of injustice and there is a graphic account of the reception given by the Aeginetans to the captain of Nauplia, who came to command an enquiry into the administration of these delinquents (vid. inscription over the entrance of St. George the Catholic in Paliachora). The rectors had spurned their ancient right to elect an islander to keep one key of the money-chest. They had also threatened to leave the island en masse with the commissioner, unless the captain avenged their wrongs. To spare the economy of the community, it was ordered <b>that</b> <b>appeals</b> from the governor's decision should be made on Crete, instead of in Venice. The republic was to pay a bakshish to the Turkish governor of the Morea and to the voivode who was stationed at the frontier of Thermisi (opposite Hydra). The fortifications too, were allowed to become decrepit and were inadequately guarded.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Yuji Horii and {{his team}} at Chunsoft began {{production}} on Dragon Quest (Dragon Warrior). After Enix published the game in early 1986, it became the template for future console RPGs. The game {{was influenced by the}} first-person random battles in Wizardry, the overhead movement in , and the mystery storytelling in Horii's own 1983 visual novel game Portopia Serial Murder Case. Horii's intention behind Dragon Quest was to create a RPG <b>that</b> <b>appeals</b> to a wider audience unfamiliar with the genre or video games in general. This required {{the creation of a new}} kind of RPG, that didn't rely on previous D experience, didn't require hundreds of hours of rote fighting, and that could appeal to any kind of gamer. Compared to statistics-heavy computer RPGs, Dragon Quest was a more streamlined, faster-paced game based on exploration and combat, and featured a top-down view in dungeons, in contrast to the first-person view used for dungeons in earlier computer RPGs. The streamlined gameplay of Dragon Quest thus made the game more accessible to a wider audience than previous computer RPGs. The game also placed a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement, building on Horii's previous work Portopia Serial Murder Case, but this time introducing a coming of age tale for Dragon Quest that audiences could relate to, making use of the RPG level-building gameplay as a way to represent this. It also featured elements still found in most console RPGs, like major quests interwoven with minor subquests, an incremental spell system, the damsel-in-distress storyline that many RPGs follow, and a romance element that remains a staple of the genre, alongside anime-style art by Akira Toriyama and a classical score by Koichi Sugiyama that was considered revolutionary for console video game music.|$|E
