2500|$|It was {{initially}} stated by police that Menezes was shot {{five times in}} the head. Mark Whitby, a passenger on the train Menezes had run onto, said: 'one of [...] was carrying a black handgun—it looked like an automatic—He half tripped… they pushed him to the floor, bundled {{on top of him}} and unloaded five shots into him.' Another passenger, Dan Copeland, said: 'an officer jumped on <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> left and screamed, [...] "Everybody out!" [...] People just froze in their seats cowering for a few seconds and then leapt up. As I turned out the door on to the platform, I heard four dull bangs.' Menezes's cousin Alex Pereira, who lived with him, asserted that Menezes had been shot from behind: 'I pushed my way into the morgue. [...] They wouldn't let me see him. His mouth was twisted by the wounds and it looked like he had been shot {{from the back of the}} neck.' Later reports confirmed that Jean Charles de Menezes was shot a total of eight times: seven times in the head and once in the shoulder.|$|E
60|$|With {{a sinking}} heart I heard him. Such a phrase, coming {{at such a}} time, seemed to close <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> hopes of enlightenment.|$|E
60|$|And as {{he avoided}} it, grown {{suddenly}} cunning, {{he turned back}} towards <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> bar <b>my</b> exit should I attempt to lead him round the table.|$|R
60|$|The old madness {{seized on}} him again. I made for <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>to</b> secure <b>my</b> retreat {{in case of}} necessity--and then ventured to look around at him.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Brooke, with {{a little}} hollow laugh. [...] "Not seriously, anyway. The fellow flung <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> in <b>my</b> face, and the blow must have partly dazed me. That reminds me that I'm wasting time. Where is he now?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} the clock. It was a quarter to twelve. This {{could not be a}} visitor at so late an hour. A patient, evidently, and {{possibly}} an all-night sitting. With a wry face I went out into the hall and opened <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>To</b> <b>my</b> astonishment it was Sherlock Holmes who stood upon my step.|$|E
60|$|I {{had just}} {{finished}} tidying up the office when there came a peremptory ring at the outer door, repeated at intervals of twenty seconds or so. It meant giving a hasty glance all round to see that no fragments of onion pie or of cheap claret lingered in unsuspected places, and it meant my going, myself, to open <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> impatient visitor.|$|E
60|$|Instinct {{kept him}} away from the more frequented streets--and {{instinct}} after awhile drew him in the direction of his friend's house at the comer of The Circus. Sir Percy Blakeney had not gone out fortunately: the lacquey who opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> lord Tony stared astonished and almost paralysed for the moment at the extraordinary appearance of his lordship. Rain dropped down from the brim of his hat on to his shoulders: his boots were muddy to the knees, his clothes wringing wet. His eyes were wild and hazy and there was a curious tremor round his mouth.|$|E
6000|$|I {{heard a noise}} below, and I went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> listen. <b>My</b> {{heart beat}} violently, but, alas! it was not she, and, bitterly disappointed, I {{returned}} to the chair. I thought I had been waiting hours, and every hour seemed a day. Would she never come? ...|$|R
50|$|The {{song was}} {{produced}} by Rick James. In the song, the group declares their devotion to a man and telling him {{that they will be}} available to him anytime: If you need some love and tenderness / And it's me, baby, that you miss / Here's the key <b>to</b> unlock <b>the</b> <b>door</b> / <b>To</b> <b>my</b> house, my house.|$|R
60|$|Another {{trick of}} mine which told against my {{reputation}} was my choice of roosting-place in an active draught upon the cabin floor. I was openly jeered and flouted for this eccentricity; and a considerable knot would sometimes gather at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> see <b>my</b> last dispositions for the night. This was embarrassing, but I learned {{to support the}} trial with equanimity.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I woke {{up again}} {{the effects of}} the pausodyne had worn {{themselves}} out, and I felt that I must have remained unconscious for at least a week or a fortnight. My candle had gone out, and I could not find my tinder-box. I rose up slowly and with difficulty, for the air of the room was close and filled with fumes, and made my way in the dark towards <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>To</b> <b>my</b> surprise, the bolt was so stiff with rust that it would hardly move. I opened it after a struggle, and found myself in the passage. Groping my way towards the trap-door of the cellar, I felt it was obstructed by some heavy body. With an immense effort, for my strength seemed but feeble, I pushed it up, and discovered that a heap of sea-coals lay on top of it. I extricated myself into the cellar, and there a fresh surprise awaited me. A new entrance had been made into the front, so that I walked out at once upon the open road, instead of up the stairs into the kitchen. Looking up at the exterior of my house, my brain reeled with bewilderment when I saw that it had disappeared almost entirely, and that a different porch and wholly unfamiliar windows occupied its façade. I must have slept far longer than I at first imagined--perhaps a whole year or more. A vague terror prevented me from walking up the steps of my own home. Possibly my brother, thinking me dead, might have sold the lease; possibly some stranger might resent my intrusion into the house that was now his own. At any rate, I thought it safer to walk into the road. I would go towards London, to my brother's house in St. Mary le Bone. I turned into the Hampstead Road, and directed my steps thitherward.|$|E
6000|$|All {{the friends}} of the Newcome family, of course, knew the {{disaster}} which had befallen the good Colonel, and I was aware, for my own part, that not only his own, but almost the whole of Rosa Newcome's property was involved in the common ruin. Some proposals of temporary relief were made to our friends from more quarters than one, but were thankfully rejected--and we were led to hope that the Colonel, having still his pension secured to him, which the law could not touch, might live comfortably enough the retirement to which, of course, he would betake himself, when the melancholy proceedings consequent on the bankruptcy were brought to an end. It was shown that he had been egregiously duped in the transaction--that his credulity had cost him and his family a large fortune--that he had given up every penny which belonged to him--that there could not be any sort of stain upon his honest reputation. The judge before whom he appeared spoke with feeling and regard of the unhappy gentleman--the lawyer who examined him respected the grief and fall of that simple old man. Thomas Newcome took a little room near the court where his affairs and the affairs of the company were adjudged--lived with a frugality which never was difficult to him--And once when perchance I met him in the City, avoided me, with a bow and courtesy that was quite humble, though proud and somehow inexpressibly touching to me. Fred Bayham was the only person whom he admitted. Fred always faithfully insisted upon attending him in and out of court. J. J. came to me immediately after he heard of the disaster, eager to place all his savings at the service of his friends. Laura and I came to London, and were urgent with similar offers. Our good friend declined to see any of us. F. B., again, with tears trickling on his rough cheeks, and a break in his voice, told me he feared that affairs must be very bad indeed, for the Colonel absolutely denied himself a cheroot to smoke. Laura drove to his lodgings and took him a box, which was held up to him as he came to open <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> wife's knock by our smiling little boy, He patted the child on his golden head and kissed him. My wife wished he would have done as much for her--but he would not--though she owned she kissed his hand. He drew it across his eyes and thanked her in a very calm and stately manner--but he did not invite her within the threshold of his door, saying simply, that such a room was not a fit place to receive a lady, [...] "as you ought to know very well, Mrs. Smith," [...] he said to the landlady, who had accompanied my wife up the stairs. [...] "He will eat scarcely anything," [...] the woman told us, [...] "his meals come down untouched; his candles are burning all night, almost, as he sits poring over his papers." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1959, Sprogell said, [...] "being a golf pro is {{not really}} a job. It seems apart from working people. After all these years I still get a thrill when I turn the key to unlock <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> pro shop because I know that today I'll talk more golf, meet new people, and teach someone {{something}} about golf".|$|E
60|$|One day in Sloane Street I {{found myself}} {{questioning}} Paraday’s landlord, {{who had come}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in answer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> knock. Two vehicles, a barouche and a smart hansom, were drawn up before the house.|$|R
60|$|In my {{room that}} evening I was making some notes {{of what had}} happened, when there came a low tap on <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> In {{obedience}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> summons Sergeant Daw came in, carefully closing <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind him.|$|R
60|$|We went out. As I {{passed him}} at <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> I saw, <b>to</b> <b>my</b> astonishment and fright, {{that he was}} deadly pale. He pushed me hastily into the open air, and closed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> upon us. Only upon us two.|$|R

5000|$|Author Katherine V. Forrest {{described}} purchasing {{and reading}} Odd Girl Out: [...] "Overwhelming need {{led me to}} walk a gauntlet of fear up to the cash register.

5000|$|Several {{days after}} the acquittal, {{allegations}} emerged that Hatfield invited four young men to an all-night party in his Fredericton home in 1981. The men accused Hatfield of giving them marijuana and using cocaine during the evening. They also alleged that Hatfield flew them to Montreal aboard a government aircraft and put them up in a downtown hotel for the night. Hatfield denied the allegations and stated that [...] "It is true {{that they were in}} my home together with others, some four years ago. However, they were strangers to me. Those who know me will confirm I am extremely gregarious. I meet and talk to people on the street, in the markets and the shops, in the restaurants and bars. I invite them to my house, I go to their houses. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> house is usually unlocked and frequently open. That is my way. I admit I am unconventional".

50|$|Actress Ellen Burstyn {{recalled}} that evening:Late in the evening, I {{wandered into the}} greenroom and saw Lee sitting next to Anna, watching the taping on the monitor. I {{sat next to him}} and we chatted a little. Lee wasn't one for small talk, so I didn't stay long. But before I got up, I said, 'Lee, I've been asked to run for president of Actors Equity.' He reached over and patted me on the back, 'That's wonderful, dahling. Congratulations.' Those were the last words he ever said to me.... Two days later, early in the morning, I was still asleep when <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> bedroom opened. I woke up and saw my friend and assistant, Katherine Cortez, enter the room and walk toward me.... 'We just got a call. Lee Strasberg died.' No, no, no, I wailed, over and over. 'I'm not ready', and pulled the covers over my head. I had told myself that I must be prepared for this, but I was not prepared. What was I to do now? Who would I work for when I was preparing for a role? Who would I go to when I was in trouble?.... His memorial service was held at the Shubert Theater where A Chorus Line was playing. Lee's coffin was brought down the aisle and placed center stage. Everybody in the theater world came - actors, writers, directors, producers, and most, if not all of, his students. He was a giant of the theater and was deeply mourned. Those of us who had the great good fortune to be fertilized and quickened by his genius would feel the loss of him {{for the rest of our}} lives.|$|E

Once down the steps, the basement hall seemed darker than the stairs, although I hardly think it possible.

40|$|Family-centered early {{intervention}} remains an elusive goal for our field. The following stories illustrate {{some of the}} challenges associated with this goal. MICHAEL On April 29, 1999, my son Michael was born. He was unresponsive and very floppy. It was a horrible time because unlike when my daughter was born, all the nurses left us alone {{most of the time}} and kept shutting <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> room. Because we insisted, a geneticist came to see him the next day. He ordered an MRI, ultrasound, and bloodwork and said he would get back to us the next week. Michael's pediatrician told my sister that she (the pediatrician) used to work with multihandicapped children, but hopefully Michael wouldn't turn out that way. We learned the next week that Michael had Prader-Willi syndrome. Michael's first problem was with eating. As with most children with this syndrome, Michael's low tone interfered with his sucking and swallowing. My pediatrician told me it was okay because these children have a problem with eating too much. She also said we did not need {{early intervention}} until he was older...|$|E
