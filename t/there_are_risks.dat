5|$|Many {{programming}} {{languages are}} already widely accepted and understood. However, {{the desire to}} create radically different programming languages to support the aspect-oriented programming paradigm is not significant due to business-related concerns; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>risks</b> associated with adopting new technologies. Use of an entirely new language relies on a business's ability to acquire new developers. Additionally, the existing code base of a business {{would need to be}} discarded. Finally, a business would need to acquire a new toolchain (suite of tools) for development, which is often both an expense in both money and time. Primary concerns about roadmaps for the adoption of new technologies tend to be the need to train new developers and adapt existing processes to the new technology.|$|E

25|$|After menopause, {{the body}} {{produces}} less estrogen, which causes the vaginal walls {{to thin out}} significantly. The effects of menopause can lead to vaginal dryness (due to a decrease in vaginal lubrication), which causes vaginal discomfort on its own or discomfort or pain during sexual intercourse. This can be alleviated with hormone replacement therapy, estrogen-containing vaginal creams, or non-prescription, non-hormonal products, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>risks</b> and adverse effects associated with hormone replacement therapy.|$|E
25|$|As {{with any}} {{surgical}} procedure, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>risks</b> of bleeding and infection. The newly transplanted lung itself {{may fail to}} properly heal and function. Because {{a large portion of}} the patient's body has been exposed to the outside air, sepsis is a possibility, so antibiotics will be given to try to prevent that. Other complications include Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, a form of lymphoma due to the immune suppressants, and gastrointestinal inflammation and ulceration of the stomach and esophagus.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} direct ways humans are {{interacting}} with monarchs is by rearing them in captivity, which has become increasingly popular, although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>risks</b> to this activity, and {{this has become a}} controversial topic. On the one hand there are many positive aspects of captive rearing. Monarchs are bred in schools and used for butterfly releases at hospices, memorial events and weddings. Memorial services for the September 11 attacks include the release of captive-bred monarchs. Monarchs are used in schools and nature centers for educational purposes. Many homeowners raise monarchs in captivity as a hobby and for educational purposes.|$|E
25|$|Beyond addiction, both {{short and}} {{long-term}} nicotine exposure have not been established as dangerous to adults, except among certain vulnerable groups. At high-enough doses, nicotine is associated with poisonings and is potentially lethal. Nicotine {{as a tool for}} quitting smoking has a good safety history. There is inadequate research to show that nicotine itself is associated with cancer in humans. Nicotine in the form of nicotine replacement products is less of a cancer risk than smoking. Nicotine is linked to possible birth defects. During pregnancy, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>risks</b> to the child later in life for type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, neurobehavioral defects, respiratory dysfunction, and infertility. The use of electronic cigarettes, which are designed to be refilled with nicotine-containing e-liquid, has raised concerns over nicotine overdoses, especially with regard to the possibility of young children ingesting the liquids.|$|E
25|$|While the {{rudimentary}} {{method of}} testing pH is to expose the grape juice to a pH indicator such as the strips used for a standard litmus test, the results are usually not as detailed and accurate as {{what is needed to}} evaluate ripeness. Therefore, most wineries will us a pH meter that can give readings to an accuracy of plus or minus 0.1. As with sugars and acids, the ideal pH levels to determine ripeness will vary. For white wines, winemakers often look for pH readings between 3.1 and 3.2, while would be a maximum of 3.4. If the pH is too high, it may be a sign that the grapes are overripe (or that the soil has too much potassium which will also influence pH readings). While <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>risks</b> to letting the pH go too high, winemakers can counter high pH by adding more tartaric or malic acid during the winemaking. However many viticulturists and winemakers uses pH readings as a strong boundary line for when to start the harvest.|$|E

500|$|J. C. Jenkins, Second Parliamentary Counsel at the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, has {{expressed}} some approval at the decision. Firstly, {{he claims that}} it will significantly change the way legislation is drafted. Prior to Pepper, draftsmanship was a [...] "time consuming" [...] and [...] "frustrating rather than enlightening" [...] business. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>risks</b> of [...] "excessive detail, over-elaboration, verbosity, prolixity, iteration, tedious repetition", and so a draftsman avoids directly dealing with every single problem, instead following the rule set out by the Renton Committee to ensure that [...] "sufficient certainty is obtained for a fair-minded and reasonable reader to be in no doubt what is intended, it being assumed {{that no one would}} take entirely perverse points against the draft, or that such points would be brushed aside by the court". The draftsman may be in conflict with a government official who wishes to be overly specific, where this general rule renders their concerns moot; in such situations, the ability to include a passage of a Minister's speech as a way to ensure that the courts will interpret legislation in a specific way may clear up any doubts they feel. As such, Jenkins feels that Pepper may make the jobs of parliamentary draftsmen much easier. Although one academic called Pepper a [...] "long overdue" [...] decision from [...] "which there is no turning back", the overall reaction was a negative one. The decision can be interpreted as promoting legislative supremacy, a key point in a system where parliamentary sovereignty is confirmed.|$|E

The project was greeted initially with [...] "a lot of resistance," [...] said Wertheimer, because it runs counter to past practice which sought to limit the pooling of information. He said <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>risks</b> in everything everyone does: [...] "the key is risk management, not risk avoidance." [...] Some encouragement has been necessary to spur contributions from the traditional intelligence community.

2500|$|Foreign nurses that {{migrate from}} {{developing}} countries to fill the nursing shortage of developed nations pursue their own economic, career, and lifestyle interests, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>risks.</b> The media and scholars have remained relatively silent on the ethical concerns involving the potential exploitation of foreign nurses. On the level of national sovereignty and global equality, there are ethical concerns about the pull of developed nations on developing countries' skilled workers and assets. U.S. incentives such as signing bonuses {{can be seen as}} promoting brain drain. Activists have spread a new term for this: [...] "Brain drain in the south, brain waste in the north." [...] The president of the Philippines Nurse Association, George Codero, was quoted in a New York Times article as saying [...] "The Filipino people will suffer because the U.S. will get all our trained nurses".|$|E
2500|$|Although castrations {{generally}} have few complications, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>risks.</b> [...] Castration can have complication such as swelling, hemorrhage or post-operative bleeding, infections, and eventration. [...] It {{can take up}} to six weeks for residual testosterone to clear from the new gelding's system and he may continue to exhibit stallion-like behaviors in that period. For reasons not always clear, about 30% of [...] all geldings may still display a stallion-like manner, some because of a cryptorchid testicle retained in the horse, some due to previously learned behavior, but some for no clear reason. Training to eliminate these behaviors is generally effective. Another risk is to the veterinarian, if a standing castration is performed, it is possible for the horse to injure the veterinarian during the procedure, and if complications arise, the horse must be immediately anesthetized. [...] Castration does not automatically change bad habits and poor manners. This must be accomplished by proper training.|$|E
