2500|$|Process {{oriented}} psychology was {{originated in}} the 1970s by Arnold Mindell, an American Jungian analyst then living in Switzerland. [...] It began as a development of Jungian psychology {{with the concept of}} a 'dreambody' that extended dream analysis to include work with people's body symptoms and bodily experiences. Jungian analyst June Singer commented that Mindell's work 'expands the scope of Jung's psychology to include not only the psyche but also the body, relationships and the total environment.' Stanislav Grof has described Arnold Mindell as one of the 'pioneers of transpersonal psychology'. [...] Mindell's concepts of 'deep democracy' and 'worldwork' have been identified as part of a toolkit for <b>transformational</b> <b>change</b> which supports collective governance.|$|E

40|$|Summary When {{transport}} {{investments are}} made in relatively infrastructure poor newly industrializing regions, the consequences extend beyond growth effects to some <b>transformational</b> <b>changes.</b> This paper empirically estimates the direction and the magnitude {{of some of the}} consequent <b>transformational</b> <b>changes</b> induced via a highway project in Sri Lanka. These changes were estimated at the firm and household level via a series of production function and multivariate analyses. In light of the observed results it is likely that traditional impact studies, by failing to incorporate transformational shifts (i. e., working under the assumption of a non-changing economic structure) significantly underestimate project benefits and costs.
