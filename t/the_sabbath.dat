5|$|Shabbat {{lunch is}} also an {{important}} social meal. Since antiquity, Jewish communities all over the world devised meat casseroles that begin cooking before the lighting of candles that marks the commencement of <b>the</b> <b>Sabbath</b> on Friday night, so as to comply with the religious regulations for observing <b>the</b> <b>Sabbath.</b> In modern Israel, this filling dish, in many variations, is still eaten on <b>the</b> <b>Sabbath</b> day, not only in religiously observant households, and is also served in some restaurants during the week.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{hold that}} Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea {{and did not}} preach or study elsewhere. They agree that Jesus debated with Jewish authorities {{on the subject of}} God, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. Jesus' Jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers to pluck grain on <b>the</b> <b>Sabbath.</b> According to Sanders, it is not plausible that disagreements over how to interpret the Law of Moses and <b>the</b> <b>Sabbath</b> would have led Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed.|$|E
5|$|Strict Sabbatarianism {{was vital}} to Presbyterian culture. For members of separatist churches, the Sunday {{walk to the}} meeting house, {{sometimes}} as much as thirty miles, marked the intensity of dissent and strict keeping of <b>the</b> <b>Sabbath</b> was a mark of true membership. Fast days were also important, particularly in Seeder culture. They often did not involve actual fasting, but focused on stricter observance of <b>the</b> <b>Sabbath.</b> The established kirk had three a year, but the seeders as many as six.|$|E

5|$|Allen became Jamaica's sixth {{appointed}} governor-general (eighth overall, {{including two}} acting governors-general). He replaced Sir Kenneth O. Hall, who resigned for health reasons.

5|$|In Judaism, it is {{recommended}} to have either a salty bread or to add salt to the bread if this bread is unsalted when doing Kiddush for Shabbat. It is customary to spread some salt over the bread or to dip the bread in a little salt when passing the bread around the table after the Kiddush.

5|$|The Church of God and Saints of Christ synthesizes rituals {{from both}} Judaism and Christianity. They have adopted rites drawn {{from both the}} Old and New Testaments. Its Old Testament observances {{include the use of}} the Jewish calendar, the celebration of Passover, the {{circumcision}} of infant males, the commemoration of <b>the</b> <b>Sabbath</b> on Saturday, and the wearing of yarmulkes. Its New Testament rites include baptism (immersion) and footwashing, both of which have Old Testament origins.|$|E

They included Tkach's one-time mentor, Roderick C. Meredith, who formed the Global Church of God in 1992.

50|$|According to 16th-17th century Yemenite prayer books, many Yemenites, but not all, recited {{but only}} {{the first chapter of}} Avoth after the Shabbath Minchah prayer, doing so {{throughout}} the entire year. Beginning with the 17th century, external influence—just as with the Shami prayer text—brought about completely changed customs, with the prevalent custom today being to read the entire tractate throughout <b>the</b> <b>Sabbaths</b> between Passover and Shavuoth, a chapter each Shabbath. Rabbi Yosef Shalom Koraḥ was quoted as pointing out that in the synagogues of Rabbi Yiḥye Qafih and Rabbi Yiḥye al-Abyadh, rather than apportioning the learning for <b>the</b> <b>Sabbaths</b> between Pesaḥ and Atzeret, they would learn the entire tractate with Maimonides' commentary during the two days of Shavuoth.|$|R

5|$|Joseph {{was also}} {{unable to stop}} those who came to hear him speak from desecrating <b>the</b> <b>Sabbath,</b> and his Yiddish sermons had {{no impact on the}} younger generation. In addition, he had to contend with a number of obstacles: he had no {{administrative}} experience or training, local Orthodox rabbis (particularly Joshua Seigel) and Jews outside his congregation did not accept his authority, and non-Orthodox Jews and groups criticized him. These problems were exacerbated by a stroke suffered in 1895, which partially incapacitated him, followed by a relapse in 1900 which left him bedridden.|$|E
5|$|Judah and two {{siblings}} were boarded {{with relatives}} in Fayetteville for about 18 {{months after the}} rest of the family moved to Charleston. He attended the Fayetteville Academy, a well-regarded school where his intelligence was recognized. In Charleston, his father was among the founders of the first Reform congregation in the United States, with shorter services conducted in English rather than Hebrew. Philip was ultimately expelled from that community, as he did not keep <b>the</b> <b>Sabbath,</b> and the extent of Judah's religious education is uncertain. The boy's intelligence was noted by others in Charleston, one of whom offered to finance his education.|$|E
5|$|Many {{contemporary}} Orthodox scholars {{rule that}} the area {{in front of the}} Wall has the status of a synagogue and must be treated with due respect. This is the view upheld by the authority in charge of the wall. As such, men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall, and to dress appropriately. When departing, the custom is to walk backwards away from the Wall. On Saturdays, it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices, including cameras, which infringe on the sanctity of <b>the</b> <b>Sabbath.</b>|$|E
