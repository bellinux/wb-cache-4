5|$|An {{investigation}} {{conducted by}} the office of the Prosecutors General of the Soviet Union (1990–1991) and the Russian Federation (1991–2004) confirmed Soviet responsibility for the massacres but refused to classify this action as a war crime or an act of genocide. The investigation was closed on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> perpetrators of the atrocity were already dead, and since the Russian government would not classify the dead as victims of the Great Purge, formal posthumous rehabilitation was deemed inapplicable.|$|E
5|$|George Wimpey became Taylor Wimpey {{through a}} {{corporate}} merger and submitted an application in 2010 {{to build a}} further 15 homes on the site. A report by the London Borough of Hillingdon's planning department rejected the proposal in December that year on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> site was already overdeveloped. Local residents had raised this concern in November that year, which {{the leader of the}} council explained was out of the council's control due to planning laws.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, German {{botanist}} Otto Kuntze {{challenged the}} generic name Banksia L.f., on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name Banksia {{had previously been}} published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B.aemula as Sirmuellera serratifolia. The challenge failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved.|$|E

English botanist James Britten proposed the genus name Isostylis in 1905, and hence called it Isostylis serrata, {{for the same reasons}} as Kuntze. The challenges failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved in 1940.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, Olivier Bancoult, {{a native}} Chagossian {{and leader of}} the Chagos Refugees Group, brought a {{judicial}} review claim against the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs for the initial ordinance which led to the Chagossian removal.

5|$|On January 19, 2010, the Supreme Court {{ordered the}} appeals court to reconsider its {{decision}} to rescind the death penalty, with the same three-judge panel convening in Philadelphia on November 9, 2010, to hear oral argument. On April 26, 2011, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reaffirmed its prior decision to vacate the death sentence on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> jury instructions and verdict form were ambiguous and confusing. The Supreme Court declined {{to hear the case}} in October.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} {{challenges}} to government repression came in 1953. An organization named ONE, Inc. published a magazine called ONE. The U.S. Postal Service refused to mail its August issue, which concerned homosexuals in heterosexual marriages, on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> material was obscene despite it being covered in brown paper wrapping. The case eventually went to the Supreme Court, which in 1958 ruled that ONE, Inc. could mail its materials through the Postal Service.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the dam project also {{arose in}} {{concern of the}} dam's cost. Several United States congressmen and fiscal conservatives protested the {{proposal}} on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> money that would be spent on its construction would be better used to support other projects. They pointed {{to the lack of}} existing infrastructure in the region and said it was unlikely that enough electricity generated by the dam could be sold at a high enough price to pay for its construction.|$|E

5|$|The Sardinian cheese casu marzu {{is exposed}} to flies known as cheese skippers such as Piophila casei, {{members of the family}} Piophilidae. The {{digestive}} activities of the fly larvae soften the cheese and modify the aroma as {{part of the process of}} maturation. At one time European Union authorities banned sale of the cheese and it was becoming hard to find, but the ban has been lifted on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cheese is a traditional local product made by traditional methods.|$|E
5|$|The {{death toll}} is unknown but {{traditionally}} {{thought to have}} been small, as only six verified deaths were recorded. This reasoning has recently been challenged on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> deaths of poor and middle-class people were not recorded, while the heat of the fire may have cremated many victims, leaving no recognisable remains. A melted piece of pottery on display at the Museum of London found by archaeologists in Pudding Lane, where the fire started, shows that the temperature reached 1250 °C.|$|E

5|$|When Slayton {{submitted}} the proposed crew assignments to NASA headquarters, George Mueller turned {{them down on}} <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> crew was too inexperienced. So Slayton asked Jim Lovell, {{who had been the}} backup commander for Apollo 11, and was slated to command Apollo 14, if his crew would be willing to fly Apollo 13 instead. He agreed to do so, and Shepard's inexperienced crew was assigned to Apollo 14.|$|E
5|$|After the Court of Appeal of England and Wales {{ruled in}} his favour, {{the book was}} made {{available}} in the UK. However following the publication, the British Government obtained a High Court order to confiscate all proceeds from the book, on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government owned the copyright to anything written by Tomlinson. In September 2008, MI6 ended all legal objection to the publication of The Big Breach, released the proceeds from the publication to Tomlinson, and admitted that the organisation's previous legal actions against him were disproportionate. However, it still refused to reinstate him or compensate him {{for the loss of}} his career and pension. Since 2009, Tomlinson can now travel freely to the UK.|$|E
5|$|Although Roosevelt, {{most of his}} aides, Johnson, and the NRA staff {{felt the}} Act would survive a court test, the U.S. Department of Justice had on March 25, 1935, {{declined}} to appeal an appellate court ruling overturning the lumber industry code on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> case {{was not a good}} test of the NIRA's constitutionality. The Justice Department's action worried many in the administration. But on April 1, 1935 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the NIRA in the Schechter case. Although Donald Richberg and others felt the government's case in Schechter was not a strong one, the Schechters were determined to appeal their conviction. So the government appealed first, and the Supreme Court heard oral argument on May 2 and 3.|$|E
