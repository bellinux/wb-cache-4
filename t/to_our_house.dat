25|$|From Bauhaus <b>to</b> <b>Our</b> <b>House,</b> Tom Wolfe, 1981.|$|E
25|$|Wolfe {{also wrote}} two critiques of and social {{histories}} {{of modern art}} and modern architecture, The Painted Word and From Bauhaus <b>to</b> <b>Our</b> <b>House,</b> published in 1975 and 1981, respectively. The Painted Word mocked the excessive insularity {{of the art world}} and its dependence on what he saw as faddish critical theory. In From Bauhaus <b>to</b> <b>Our</b> <b>House</b> he explored what he said were the negative effects of the Bauhaus style on the evolution of modern architecture.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Why then,' {{said the}} boy, 'you {{was to come}} to him at six o'clock <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>'ouse,</b> 'cos {{he wants to see}} you--Blue Boar, Leaden'all Markit. Shall I say you're comin'?' ...|$|R
60|$|And {{the good}} wives who came[16] <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>houses,</b> offer us their pieces of linen, upon which their whole {{dependence}} lies, for so little profit, {{that it can}} neither half pay their rents, nor half support their families.|$|R
6000|$|... "The old gentleman," [...] he said, [...] "has {{something}} to do with the Government, and they were in attendance upon him. You can realize, my friend," [...] he added, [...] "that you are indeed in a republican country. Such people must have the entrée <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>houses,</b> even <b>to</b> <b>our</b> table. I presume that you will have the pleasure of taking luncheon with him even." ...|$|R
500|$|In June 1812, {{her father}} sent Mary {{to stay with}} the dissenting family of the radical William Baxter, near Dundee, Scotland. To Baxter, he wrote, [...] "I am anxious that she should be brought up...like a philosopher, even like a cynic." [...] Scholars have speculated that she may have been sent away for her health, to remove her from the seamy side of business, or to {{introduce}} her to radical politics. Mary Godwin revelled in the spacious surroundings of Baxter's house and in the companionship of his four daughters, and she returned north in the summer of 1813 for a further stay of 10 months. In the 1831 introduction to Frankenstein, she recalled: [...] "I wrote then—but in a most common-place style. It was beneath the trees of the grounds belonging <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>house,</b> or on the bleak sides of the woodless mountains near, that my true compositions, the airy flights of my imagination, were born and fostered." ...|$|E
500|$|Alison remembers herself, as a child, {{demanding}} {{that her father}} play [...] "airplane" [...] with her, while Bruce sorts through a box of junk and valuables he has salvaged from a barn ("It All Comes Back"). Bruce tells the family that a visitor from the local historical society is coming to see their ornate Victorian home that he has restored, and his wife Helen prepares the house to Bruce's demanding aesthetic standard ("Welcome <b>to</b> <b>Our</b> <b>House</b> on Maple Avenue"). In a phone call with her father and a journal entry, Medium Alison expresses her anxiety about starting college ("Not Too Bad"). At the Bechdel Funeral Home, Small Alison and her brothers John and Christian hide in caskets while Bruce talks to a client. The children perform an imaginary advertisement for the funeral home ("Come to the Fun Home"). Medium Alison hesitates outside {{the door of the}} college's Gay Union, and is flummoxed when she meets Joan, a confident young lesbian. Bruce invites into the house Roy, a young man whom he has hired to do yard work. Bruce begins to seduce Roy in the library while Helen is playing the piano upstairs, trying her best to ignore it ("Helen's Etude").|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} general acclaim from critics. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times described the video {{as one of}} Knowles' best and most vivid. Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly described Knowles as [...] "one hot housewife in the [...] video". This was echoed by Tray Hova of Vibe magazine who stated that [...] "Beyoncé makes a mighty fine housewife". Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News said that she did her best impersonation of Betty Draper. The Music Network complimented {{the production of the}} video while simultaneously making reference to Christina Aguilera and criticising the latter for her new video for her single [...] "Not Myself Tonight", writing: [...] "...housework has never looked so good ... Proving you don't have to wear bondage gear and a ball-gag to be sexy (hello Christina!), the 50s-style video sees the R queen [...] getting dirty in a different way: dusting her Grammys, watering the plants and scrubbing the shower in vintage lingerie... She can come over <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>house</b> anytime." [...] Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard magazine commented on Knowles' [...] "dominatrix costume" [...] at the end to Rihanna's Rated R era. She finally complimented the music video by saying that [...] "Beyoncé's shamelessly campy performance—complete with boatloads of running mascara—is generously refreshing." [...] Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy noted that the video was [...] "kind of a tour de force" [...] and compared it with the one for [...] "Telephone" [...] (2010). He also noted that it showed [...] "Beyoncé {{on the edge of a}} nervous breakdown." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I know a {{relative}} of his who comes <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>'ouse</b> every three months, to renew a little bill," [...] says Mr. Moss, with a grin: [...] "and I know this, if I go to the Earl of Kew in the Albany, or the Honourable Captain Belsize, Knightsbridge Barracks, they let me in soon enough. I'm told his father ain't got much money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's later," [...] said Miss Walshingham. [...] "We're {{stopping}} {{until my}} brother's holiday begins and we're trying <b>to</b> let <b>our</b> <b>house.</b> Where {{are you staying}} in Folkestone?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Fellow citizens," [...] Van Artevelde went on, [...] "there is now {{but one of}} {{two things}} for us to do. The one is <b>to</b> shut <b>our</b> gates, retire <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>houses,</b> and there die either by famine or by such other means as each may choose. The other way is, that every man capable of bearing arms shall muster, that we shall march to Bruges, and there either perish under the lances of his knights, or conquer and drive him headlong from the land. Which choose ye, my friends?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's {{a letter}} from Gratian; George has been sent home ill, and he's gone <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>house.</b> She's got leave from her {{hospital}} {{to come home and}} nurse him." ...|$|E
