5|$|A sejm {{began with}} a solemn mass, a {{verification}} of deputies mandates, and election of <b>the</b> <b>Marshal</b> of the Sejm (also known as the Speaker). (The position of <b>the</b> <b>Marshal</b> of the Sejm (and sejmik) {{who presided over the}} proceedings and was elected from the body of deputies evolved in the 17th century.) Next, the kanclerz (chancellor) declared the king's intentions to both chambers, who would then debate separately till the ending ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The marshall's moans of pain get worse, {{disturbing}} the other survivors. Eventually he asks to see Kate alone, {{and when she}} enters the tent, <b>the</b> <b>marshal</b> asks what Kate {{wanted to ask him}} before he was knocked unconscious during the crash. Kate tells him she wants to make sure Ray gets his reward. <b>The</b> <b>marshal</b> laughs, telling Kate that she is one of a kind, and then asks if he is going to die. Kate nods, and he asks if she is going to do it. As Kate leaves, Sawyer enters with the gun, and a gunshot is heard. Jack becomes angry but Sawyer claims that <b>the</b> <b>marshal</b> asked to be killed. Muffled coughs are then heard, and it is revealed that Sawyer's shot missed the marshal's heart and pierced his lung, causing him more pain. Jack then euthanizes <b>the</b> <b>marshal,</b> presumably by suffocating him.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of 'Marshal' was {{equivalent to the}} {{position of}} 'Speaker' in Westminster-style parliaments. <b>The</b> <b>Marshal</b> was considered the presiding officer of the Diet.|$|E
5000|$|The 'boulevards des Maréchaux' (Boulevards of <b>the</b> <b>Marshals,</b> a loop {{encircling}} {{the city}} consisting of boulevards named for <b>the</b> <b>Marshals</b> of France), built {{to replace the}} Thiers Wall.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>marshal's</b> star {{corresponds}} {{with the western}} use of <b>the</b> <b>marshal's</b> baton. On <b>the</b> death of the recipient, the award is returned to the diamond fund for re-use.|$|R
50|$|When the Weaver {{case was}} {{passed from the}} ATF to <b>the</b> <b>Marshals</b> Service, no one {{informed}} <b>the</b> <b>marshals</b> of <b>the</b> fact that ATF had attempted to solicit Weaver as an informant.|$|R
5|$|Field marshal is {{equivalent}} to an admiral of the fleet in the Indian Navy or a marshal of the Air Force in the Indian Air Force. While Arjan Singh is the only holder of <b>the</b> <b>marshal</b> {{of the air force}} to date, no officer has ever been promoted to admiral of the fleet.|$|E
5|$|Field marshal is {{equivalent}} to an admiral of the fleet in the Indian Navy or a marshal {{of the air force}} in the Indian Air Force. In the navy, admiral of the fleet has never been awarded, but from the air force, Arjan Singh was promoted to <b>the</b> <b>marshal</b> of the air force.|$|E
5|$|On 3 July 1832, Duyệt {{died in the}} Citadel of Saigon {{at the age of}} 68. He {{was buried}} at Bình Hòa, Gia Định (present day Ho Chi Minh City). His tomb was called Lăng Ông Bà Chiểu ("Tomb of <b>the</b> <b>Marshal</b> in Ba Chieu") by the local people.|$|E
5000|$|Between 2005 {{and the end}} of 2006 <b>the</b> <b>marshalling</b> {{yards of}} Achères and Villeneuve-Saint-Georges closed the Grande Ceinture thus no longer links <b>the</b> <b>marshalling</b> yard at Le Bourget to the radial lines.|$|R
50|$|Immediately to {{the east}} of the {{passenger}} station there is a marshalling yard where there are numerous tracks for <b>the</b> <b>marshalling</b> of freight trains. <b>The</b> <b>marshalling</b> of trains is facilitated by a hump.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marshals</b> {{started out}} as <b>the</b> Waco <b>Marshals</b> in 2004, but {{finished}} their inaugural season with a disappointing 2-8 record. For the next season they relocated to Cincinnati and became <b>the</b> Cincinnati <b>Marshals.</b>|$|R
5|$|One of {{the noble}} representatives held the {{position}} of <b>the</b> <b>Marshal</b> of the Sejm (speaker). Marshals of the Sejm of the Grand Duchy included Antoni Paweł Sułkowski (the speaker of the first sejm) and Hans Wilhelm von Unruhe-Bomst, marshall as of 1874.|$|E
5|$|Piłsudski {{had given}} Poland {{something}} akin to what Henryk Sienkiewicz's Onufry Zagłoba had mused about: a Polish Oliver Cromwell. As such, <b>the</b> <b>Marshal</b> had inevitably drawn both intense loyalty and intense vilification.|$|E
5|$|Sejmiks {{were usually}} {{held in a}} large, open field. The nobility would elect a {{presiding}} officer (marszałek sejmiku: sejmik marshal), whose role was analogous to <b>the</b> <b>marshal</b> of the sejm at national Sejms. (This term has been revived since 1999, but it now refers to {{the chairman of the}} voivodeship executive board rather than the presiding officer of the sejmik itself.) While the sejmiks were originally convened by the king, soon a loophole was exploited: the sejmiks would limit the number of issues discussed, using that as a pretext to reconvene later at a time chosen by <b>the</b> <b>marshal.</b> Voivodes and starosts also had the ability to convene some sejmiks. Until the reforms of the Constitution of 3 May, all the nobility residing in the territory that was holding a sejmik were eligible to participate in the sejmik.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>marshal's</b> {{star has}} a {{triangular}} eyelet {{in the upper}} beam which is connected to an oval eyelet measuring 14 mm. <b>The</b> <b>marshal's</b> star is suspended by a 25 mm moire ribbon. The total weight of <b>the</b> large <b>marshal's</b> star is 36.8 g. Approximately 200 {{of this type of}} marshal's star were produced.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marshals</b> were a {{professional}} indoor football team based out of Dayton, Ohio. They played their 2007 home games out of [...] Hara Arena in Dayton, Ohio, but are more famous for playing as <b>the</b> Cincinnati <b>Marshals</b> at U.S. Bank Arena for their two seasons before a failed {{plan to move}} home games to Wall2Wall Soccer arena in nearby Mason, Ohio. <b>The</b> <b>Marshals</b> played their 2004 inaugural season in Waco, TX, as <b>the</b> Waco <b>Marshals.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marshals</b> won both {{games on}} their schedule, {{defeating}} the Los Angeles Dragons and Miami Tropics, before the league abruptly ended its season and ceased operations. <b>The</b> <b>Marshals</b> and there would've-been-rivals, the San Antonio Matadors, were named league co-champions.|$|R
5|$|Crillon {{joined the}} Régiment du Roi (King's Regiment) in 1734, aged 16, as a {{lieutenant}} en second {{and participated in}} France's Italian campaign during the War of the Polish Succession. He was soon promoted to lieutenant en premier and {{took part in a}} number of notable actions, including the Battle of San Pietro, under the command of <b>the</b> <b>Marshal</b> de Villars. He remained with the regiment until 1738 when he was promoted to the rank of colonel in the Régiment de Bretagne (Regiment of Brittany).|$|E
5|$|Kate is {{revealed}} to be the marshal's prisoner, wearing the handcuffs that Walt found in the jungle. As the turbulence hits, <b>the</b> <b>marshal</b> is knocked unconscious by a falling suitcase. Kate struggles to put on her oxygen mask due to the handcuffs, so she uncuffs herself using the marshal's keys and puts the marshal's oxygen mask on him before attaching her own, {{at which point the}} tail end of the plane suddenly breaks off and flies away.|$|E
5|$|Soult rapidly {{gathered}} a new army from the French forces in Andalusia and, joining {{with the troops}} retreating before Beresford, he marched to relieve the siege. With intelligence of another approaching force—a Spanish army under Gen. Joaquín Blake—he planned to turn Beresford's flank and interpose his army between the two. However, Soult was again acting on outdated information; unknown to <b>the</b> <b>Marshal,</b> the Spaniards had already linked up with the Anglo-Portuguese corps, and his 24,000 troops now faced a combined Allied army 35,000 strong.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marshals</b> Service is {{responsible}} for apprehending wanted fugitives, providing protection for the federal judiciary, [...] transporting federal prisoners, protecting endangered federal witnesses, and managing assets seized from criminal enterprises. <b>The</b> <b>Marshals</b> Service {{is responsible}} for 55.2% of arrests of federal fugitives. Between 1981 and 1985, <b>the</b> <b>Marshals</b> Service conducted Fugitive Investigative Strike Team operations to jump-start fugitive capture in specific districts. In 2012, U.S. marshals captured over 36,000 federal fugitives and cleared over 39,000 fugitive warrants.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> {{office of}} <b>Marshal</b> {{was created by}} statute in 1867. <b>The</b> <b>Marshals</b> since that date have been: ...|$|R
50|$|In the branches, {{the rank}} of colonel general was succeeded by <b>the</b> rank of <b>marshal</b> of <b>the</b> branch. While <b>the</b> rank of <b>marshal</b> of a branch was {{apparently}} equal to the one of general of the army (who was only entitled to the four small shoulder board stars), <b>the</b> <b>marshals</b> of branches had <b>the</b> <b>marshal's</b> star of <b>the</b> 2nd level on the tie and the large 40mm star on the shoulder boards, but the general of the army had neither. Generals of the army were given the 40mm star shoulder board and <b>the</b> <b>marshal's</b> star of <b>the</b> 2nd level on the tie in 1974.|$|R
5|$|The Diet had {{legislative}} powers. The {{legislative initiative}} was {{possessed by the}} Emperor, along with the Diet executive (six deputies and <b>the</b> <b>Marshal),</b> and all individual deputies. It could debate and pass laws related to many issues {{in the field of}} education, culture, welfare, justice, public works, administration, religion and military. It could also impose supplementary taxes, up to 10% of the direct tax.|$|E
5|$|The castle briefly {{reverted to}} the Crown again, but in 1247 passed by {{marriage}} to William de Valence, half brother to Henry III. De Valence was a French nobleman from Poitiers and a noted soldier who {{spent most of}} his life fighting in military campaigns; Henry arranged his marriage to Joan de Munchensi, one of the heiresses to <b>the</b> <b>Marshal</b> estate. The marriage made Valence immensely rich and gave him the title of Earl of Pembroke.|$|E
5|$|The competences of sejmiks varied over time, {{and there}} were also {{geographical}} differences. Often, numerous different types of sejmiks coexisted in the same governance structure. Almost always presided over by <b>the</b> <b>marshal,</b> sejmiks could often elect delegates to the national sejm, and sometimes could give them binding instructions. Sejmiks attained the peak of their importance {{at the turn of}} the 18th century, when they effectively supplanted the inefficient national sejm.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Dallas <b>Marshals</b> are {{a member}} of Champions Indoor Football. Based in Mesquite, Texas, <b>the</b> <b>Marshals</b> play their home games at the Mesquite Arena.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, Browning {{signed with}} <b>the</b> Mesquite <b>Marshals</b> of Champions Indoor Football for the 2016 season. On July 27, 2017, Browning re-signed with <b>the</b> <b>Marshals.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marshals</b> {{fell into}} three generational groups.|$|R
5|$|The medieval aristocratic {{household}} was not {{fixed to}} one location, {{but could be}} more or less permanently on the move. Greater nobles would have estates scattered over large geographical areas, and to maintain proper control of all their possessions it was important to physically inspect the localities on a regular basis. As the master of the horses, travel was the responsibility of <b>the</b> <b>marshal.</b> Everything in the noble household was designed for travel, so that the lord could enjoy the same luxury wherever he went.|$|E
5|$|The post is {{associated}} with a non-stipendiary Fellowship of All Souls College. Changes to the university's internal rules since 1920 have abolished specific statutes for the duties of, and rules for appointment to, individual chairs such as <b>the</b> <b>Marshal</b> Foch Professorship. The University Council is now empowered to make appropriate arrangements for appointments and conditions of service, and the college to which any professorship is allocated (All Souls in this instance) has two representatives on the board of electors.|$|E
5|$|A {{recovered}} Herkus Monte raided Culmerland {{with a large}} {{force and}} took many prisoners in 1263. On {{his way back to}} Natangia, Herkus and his men were confronted by a contingent of their enemies. In the Battle of Löbau that ensued, Prussians killed forty knights, including the Master and <b>the</b> <b>Marshal.</b> The Prussians also received help from Lithuanians and Sudovians. In summer of 1262 Treniota and Shvarn attacked Masovia, killing Duke Siemowit I, and raided Culmerland, provoking Pogesanians to join the uprising. However, assassination of Mindaugas and subsequent dynastic fights prevented Lithuanians from further campaigns. Skalmantas, leader of Sudovians, raided Culm (Chełmno) in 1263 and in 1265.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marshals</b> Service {{is based}} in Arlington, Virginia, and, under the {{authority}} {{and direction of the}} Attorney General, is headed by a Director, who is assisted by a Deputy Director. <b>The</b> <b>Marshals</b> Service headquarters provides command, control, and cooperation for the disparate elements of the service.|$|R
5000|$|Go to Court is a {{variation}} of tag involving [...] "fugitives" [...] and [...] "marshals". <b>The</b> <b>marshals</b> consist of approximately 1/5 of the total group and in either a dark house or neighborhood. After <b>the</b> countdown, <b>the</b> <b>marshals</b> pursue <b>the</b> fugitives. If a fugitive is spotted, a marshal may shout [...] "Go to court!" [...] whereupon the fugitive must go to a designated spot and await physical contact from another fugitive to resume part in <b>the</b> game. <b>The</b> <b>marshals</b> win if they successfully gather all of the fugitives.|$|R
