5|$|Only the {{serrated}} {{and often}} keratinized {{tip of the}} sublingua is free to move small distances along <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongue, {{while the majority of}} its length adheres to <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongue. These free-moving folds or filaments are called the plica fimbriata and attach {{to the base of the}} sublingua and are supported at the midline by the plica mediana. The plica fimbriata is highly developed and specialized in lemurs, and makes up the majority of the sublingua.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen is {{long and}} slender and {{consists}} of 10 segments and a terminal appendage-bearing segment. The second and third segments are enlarged, and in males, a cleft on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second segment contains a pair of claspers and the penis. The spermaries open on the 9th segment. In females, the genital opening is on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eighth segment and is covered by a simple flap or an ovipositor, depending on species and the method of egg-laying.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> claw of H.americanus is {{orange or}} red, while that of H.gammarus is creamy white or very pale red.|$|E
50|$|Asteronotus spongicolus {{feeds on}} the leafy sponge Carteriospongia sp. and is well camouflaged on <b>the</b> <b>undersides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sponge blades.|$|R
50|$|As {{the name}} suggests, most adults are found on <b>the</b> <b>undersides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaves <b>of</b> shrubs and trees, while larvae {{have found in}} rotting wood, leaf litter, and nests of other insects.|$|R
50|$|C. dealbata is most {{noteworthy}} for its leaves. Like {{those of}} C. moschata they are divided, {{but unlike the}} latter the division is quite regular. <b>The</b> <b>undersides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaves are covered in silver hairs.|$|R
5|$|Ventral grooves {{run from}} the lower jaw to the umbilicus, about halfway along <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body. These grooves are less {{numerous}} (usually 14–22) than in other rorquals, but are fairly wide.|$|E
5|$|Down {{the middle}} of the sublingua is a thick {{strengthening}} rod called the plica mediana or lytta, which connects the sublingua to <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongue, and is part of the lingual septum (septum of the tongue). The thickness and size of the plica mediana can vary between species, and except in treeshrews, it is cartilaginous and provides support for the sublingua.|$|E
5|$|Scales in {{the central}} or throat region, which are {{in contact with the}} first ventral scales of a snake's body and are flanked by the chin shields, are called gular scales. The mental groove is a {{longitudinal}} groove on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head between the large, paired chin shields and continuing between the smaller gular scales.|$|E
50|$|Both {{subspecies}} {{are small}} brown butterflies with a wingspan rage <b>of</b> 34-44 mm. <b>The</b> upper surfaces <b>of</b> their wings are unmarked, while <b>the</b> <b>undersides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings have rows of round, yellow-ringed eyespots. N. m. francisci is slightly darker, with more irregularly shaped eyespots.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> and <b>the</b> topside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings have eyespots at the distal-most ends, {{surrounded}} by reddish-brown shading. There is variation between individuals in <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> eyespots, <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reddish-brown colouring around the eyespots, and the silvery-white markings on <b>the</b> <b>undersides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hindwings.|$|R

5|$|The M249 is a belt-fed {{light machine}} gun. It fires the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge, usually a {{combination}} of one M856 tracer and four M855 ball cartridges fed from M27 linked belts. Belts are typically held in a hard plastic or soft canvas box attached to <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weapon.|$|E
5|$|The hindwing is {{frequently}} caudate, i.e. the veins {{near the end}} of the tornus have one or more tails. The tornus itself being often produced and frequently lobed. Along the hindwing termen there are tightly-packed scales in a double row. <b>The</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scales project and form a regular narrow fringe referred to as cilia.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches are {{generalized}} insects, {{with few}} special adaptations, {{and may be}} among the most primitive living neopteran insects. They have a relatively small head and a broad, flattened body, and most species are reddish-brown to dark brown. They have large compound eyes, two ocelli, and long, flexible antennae. The mouthparts are on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head and include generalized chewing mandibles, salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors.|$|E
50|$|A dense indumentum of simple, reddish-brown hairs (≤3 mm long) {{is present}} on <b>the</b> <b>undersides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tendrils. These hairs are , being lost with age. Shorter hairs {{of up to}} 2 mm are sparsely {{distributed}} on laminar margins and <b>the</b> outer surfaces <b>of</b> developing pitchers. These hairs turn silvery with age.|$|R
2500|$|It was {{powered by}} a {{supercharged}} 9-cylinder [...] Potez 9B air-cooled radial engine driving a two-bladed fixed pitch propeller. The engine was specially designed for the competition, which limited displacement to [...] The primary structure and covering was wood. The undercarriage retracted outwards into <b>the</b> <b>undersides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings while the tailskid was fixed.|$|R
50|$|Eueides isabella {{is a large}} {{butterfly}} with a wingspan of 65 - 90 mm. <b>The</b> uppersides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings is dark brown, {{with orange}} bands and yellowish markings on <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forewings. <b>The</b> <b>undersides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings are quite similar to the uppersides, but <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hindwings show {{a series of small}} blue spots.|$|R
5|$|Mantas {{evolved from}} bottom-dwelling stingrays, {{eventually}} developing more wing-like pectoral fins. M. birostris {{still has a}} vestigial remnant of a sting barb {{in the form of}} a caudal spine. The mouths of most rays lie on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head, while in mantas they are right at the front. Manta rays and devil rays are the only ray species that have evolved into filter feeders.|$|E
5|$|Many {{families}} of moths have special organs to help detect bat echolocation. These organs {{are known as}} tympana (singular – typanum). The Pyraloidea and almost all Geometroidea have tympana located on the anterior sternite of the abdomen. The Noctuoidea also have tympana, but in their case, the tympana are located on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metathorax, the structure and position of which are unique and a taxonomic distinguishing feature of the superfamily.|$|E
5|$|Newcastle United hosted Chelsea at St James' Park in {{the fifth}} round of the competition. The home team came close to scoring after the midway point of the first half; Obafemi Martins's shot towards the Chelsea goal hit <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{crossbar}} and bounced down, before the ball was cleared. In the 79th minute, Drogba – on as a substitute – scored the winning goal of the match, from a free-kick.|$|E
25|$|Traditional tempeh {{is often}} {{produced}} in Indonesia using Hibiscus tiliaceus leaves. <b>The</b> <b>undersides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaves {{are covered in}} downy hairs (known technically as trichomes) to which the mold Rhizopus oligosporus can be found adhering in the wild. Soybeans are pressed into the leaf, and stored. Fermentation occurs resulting in tempeh. In particular, the tempeh undergoes salt-free aerobic fermentation.|$|R
25|$|Major leaf {{diseases}} are anthracnose (Gnomonia caryae) and mildew (Microstroma juglandis). The former causes brown spots with definite margins on <b>the</b> <b>undersides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaf. These may coalesce and cause widespread blotching. Mildew invades {{the leaves and}} twigs and may form witches' brooms by stimulating bud formation. Although locally prevalent, mildew offers no problem in <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> hickory.|$|R
50|$|Cochranella euknemos {{are small}} frogs, males growing to 25 mm and females to 32 mm in snout-vent length. They are dorsally blue-green {{and a little}} granular, with many small whitish or {{yellowish}} spots. Ventrally they are transparent white, but with more yellow on <b>the</b> <b>undersides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arms and legs. Iris is grayish ivory. Feet are moderately webbed.|$|R
5|$|The Harrier II {{retains the}} {{tandem landing gear}} layout of the first-generation Harriers, {{although}} each outrigger landing gear leg was moved from the wingtip to mid-span for a tighter turning radius when taxiing. The engine intakes are larger {{than those of the}} first-generation Harrier, and have a revised inlet. On <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage, McDonnell Douglas added lift-improvement devices, which capture the reflected engine exhaust when close to the ground, giving the equivalent of up to 1,200lb (544kg) of extra lift.|$|E
5|$|The PL.8 also {{incorporated}} several {{safety features}} {{in case of}} ditching at sea. Apart from small floats attached directly to the undersides of the lower wing, the main units of the fixed, tailskid undercarriage could be jettisoned on takeoff, {{in order to reduce}} the aircraft's weight. <b>The</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage was given a boat-like shape and made watertight for a water landing. Nungesser and Coli's plan was to make a water landing in New York, in front of the Statue of Liberty.|$|E
5|$|The YF-23 was an unconventional-looking aircraft, with {{diamond-shaped}} wings, {{a profile}} with substantial area-ruling to reduce aerodynamic drag at transonic speeds, and an all-moving V-tail. The cockpit was placed high, near {{the nose of}} the aircraft for good visibility for the pilot. The aircraft featured a tricycle landing gear configuration with a nose landing gear leg and two main landing gear legs. The weapons bay was placed on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage between the nose and main landing gear. The cockpit has a center stick and side throttle.|$|E
50|$|Hericium erinaceus is a {{lookalike}} spine fungus. It can {{be distinguished}} by its more compact fruit body structure that lacks multiple branches, in which the hanging spines all originate from a single thick tubercle. In Hericium coralloides, <b>the</b> spines line <b>the</b> <b>undersides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> branches, unlike H. abietis, whose branches are arranged in clusters at <b>the</b> tip <b>of</b> branches.|$|R
50|$|As {{the skin}} texture under the soles or the feet can {{naturally}} endure {{high levels of}} strain, injuries demanding medical attention, such as lacerations or bruises, are rarely inflicted if certain precautions are observed by <b>the</b> executant. <b>The</b> <b>undersides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feet have therefore become a common target for corporal punishment in many cultures while basically different methods exist.|$|R
50|$|Doxocopa laurentia has a {{wingspan}} reaching about 75 mm. <b>The</b> upperside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings is brown, {{with a broad}} metallic blue central band in males, {{while in}} the females this band is usually white, with a broad orange patch on <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forewings. <b>The</b> <b>undersides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings are yellowish or greyish, with black markings on the forewings.|$|R
5|$|The adult California condor is {{a uniform}} black with the {{exception}} of large triangular patches or bands of white on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings. It has gray legs and feet, an ivory-colored bill, a frill of black feathers surrounding the base of the neck, and brownish red eyes. The juvenile is mostly a mottled dark brown with blackish coloration on the head. It has mottled gray instead of white on the underside of its flight feathers.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackcurrant}} leaf midge {{can cause}} browning, crimping and distortion of leaves at {{the tips of}} shoots but it is seldom a serious problem. The blackcurrant sawfly (Nematus ribesii) lays its eggs on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaves and the voracious larvae work their way along the shoots, stripping off leaf after leaf. In a serious attack, the bush can be denuded of leaves. Larvae of the currant borer drill their way along the centres of shoots, which wilt and die back. Other insect pests include scale insects, aphids and earwigs.|$|E
5|$|The genital {{openings}} (gonopores) of {{both sexes}} are located on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third body segment (near the second pair of legs) and may be accompanied in the male by one or two penes which deposit the sperm packets onto the gonopods. In the female, the genital pores open into paired small sacs called cyphopods or vulvae, which are covered by small hood-like lids, and are used to store the sperm after copulation. The cyphopod morphology {{can also be used}} to identify species. Millipede sperm lack flagella, a unique trait among myriapods.|$|E
50|$|Argina amanda has a {{wingspan}} up to 40 mm across. <b>The</b> uppersides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forewings are orange, {{except the}} black markings with some white around them. The hind wings are orange too, with black spots on <b>the</b> edges. <b>The</b> <b>undersides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings {{are very similar}} to the uppersides. The caterpillars feed on the young leaves and pods of Crotalaria species (Fabaceae).|$|R
40|$|This {{is a small}} {{brightly colored}} {{butterfly}} with a wing span of about one inch. <b>The</b> upper surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forewings have coal-black to ash-gray edges with three rows of black-bordered irregular white marks along the outer margins. <b>The</b> ground color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forewings is russet-orange with four centrally located black-bordered white markings. <b>The</b> ground color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smaller hindwings are dark brown with some splashes <b>of</b> orange near <b>the</b> wing base. The hindwings have similar markings as the forewings, especially in the females. The markings and color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male hindwings are reduced so that a concolorous brown is present. The marginal markings {{are similar to those}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forewings with <b>the</b> exception <b>of</b> being reduced in size. <b>The</b> <b>undersides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forewings are orange with a tan outer margin and markings similar to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper wing surfaces only muted.
