5|$|Some {{sources have}} claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> is a {{derivative}} of preceding works. Playboy published a photo with similar bodypainting, with a necktie, suit jacket and similar pose, in its March 1968 issue, {{as part of}} a feature on bodypainting.|$|E
5|$|The {{work has}} been praised by critics {{including}} the poet and Beowulf translator Seamus Heaney. Michael D. C. Drout called it the most important article ever written about the poem.

5|$|After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, {{during which}} Bizet {{served in the}} National Guard, he had little success with his one-act opera Djamileh, though an orchestral suite derived from his {{incidental}} music to Alphonse Daudet's play L'Arlésienne was instantly popular. The production of Bizet's final opera, Carmen, was delayed because of fears that its themes of betrayal and murder would offend audiences. After its premiere on 3 March 1875, Bizet was convinced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> was a failure; {{he died of a}} heart attack three months later, unaware that it would prove a spectacular and enduring success.|$|E

5|$|After the discovery, Libby Sheldon of University College London {{conducted}} several {{tests to}} verify the painting's age, including spectroscopy and laser microscopy. The age of the inscription was taken into consideration, and found to be contemporaneous {{with the rest of}} the painting. Pigments, including a type of yellow pigment rarely found after 1600, were appropriate for the 16th century. Dendrochronological analysis later showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> was too late to be a life portrait of Jane, but did not rule out the possibility of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only the}} first movement, copied by Voigt, is fully {{accepted}} as having been completed, the intended scale and general character of the Eighth Symphony may be inferred from several sources. Sibelius's correspondence with Voigt and with his binders, in 1933 and 1938 respectively, indicates {{the possibility of a}} notably large-scale work. Apart from Nils-Eric Fougstedt's 1947 observation, there are also indications from Voigt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> may have contained choral elements, along the lines of Beethoven's Ninth.|$|E
5|$|An Introduction was {{reviewed}} positively in several academic publications. The political philosopher Steve Cooke said that Cochrane's own approach showed promise, {{and that the}} book would have benefited from devoting more space to it. Robert Garner, a political theorist, praised Cochrane's synthesis of such {{a broad range of}} literature, but argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> was too uncritical of the concept of justice as it might apply to animals. Cochrane's account of interest-based rights for animals was subsequently considered at greater length in his 2012 book Animal Rights Without Liberation, published by Columbia University Press. An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory {{was one of the first}} books to explore animals from the perspective of political theory, and became an established part of a literature critical of the topic's traditional neglect.|$|E
50|$|A {{few years}} after Cordus's death, Seneca the Younger wrote Ad Marciam in order to console Marcia, Cordus's daughter, on the {{occasion}} of her son Metilius's death. Even though Ad Marciam is not primarily about Cordus, Seneca indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> of Cordus have been re-published. Suetonius unequivocally asserts <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> of Cremutius Cordus were put back into circulation during the reign of Gaius Caligula.|$|R

5000|$|Mills also {{explained}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> explore {{ideas of}} [...] "catharsis, of being into dissolution into being, both {{on a personal}} and sociological level." [...] Mills said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> allude to ideas about chaos and order. He also described the artworks as a [...] "cross between the forensic and a pathology of the personal in which only fragments remain, in which minimal clues can suggest events that may have occurred." ...|$|R
5|$|An {{undertaking}} of {{the restoration}} team was {{that everything would}} be handled in a transparent fashion, that reporters, art historians and others with a bona fide interest should have ready access to information and to view the work. However, a single company, Nippon Television Network Corporation, had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of The New York Times, wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of {{the restoration of the}} ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage of the process and which were the only solid evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> was being done appropriately.|$|E
5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> {{that had been done}} by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its immediate aftermath also contributed to the paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{during the rest of the}} war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E
5|$|As is {{the case}} with many castles – {{especially}} of the 12th century – there is no record of how much it cost to build Buckton Castle. However, based on comparison to Peveril Castle in Derbyshire, where construction of the keep in 11751177 cost £184 according to the Pipe Rolls, it is estimated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> at Buckton would have cost around £100. This was close to the median annual income for a baron in 1200.|$|E

5|$|Bruckner {{structured}} {{the three}} {{lines of the}} text in an ABA da capo form, closed by a coda, with A containing the first line, framing the second and third. Peter Strasser suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> reflects elements of architecture, {{such as in the}} symmetry of the da capo form and the use of motifs like building blocks.|$|E
5|$|Dvořák often adapted Bohemian {{folklore}} for his compositions, and {{his previous}} four symphonic poems {{were based on}} actual poems by the Czech poet Karel Jaromír Erben, especially Erben's collection of ballads Kytice. A Hero's Song broke away from this pattern of programmatic symphonic works, as Dvořák did not specify a specific accompanying text, and he only roughly outlined its plot in a later letter. The lack of a fixed programme has been hypothesized {{as a reason for}} its relative neglect when compared to Dvořák's other symphonic works. It has also been suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> was intended to be autobiographical, an unusual approach for Dvořák. This was Dvořák's only symphonic poem that pursued Franz Liszt's idealized view of the genre, as Dvořák's other four works were based on eerie subjects not appropriate to Liszt's conception.|$|E
5|$|Early Mormons {{understood}} the Book of Mormon to be a religious {{history of the}} indigenous peoples of the Americas. Smith's followers {{view it as a}} companion to the Bible and an additional witness of Christ, akin to a large apocryphal work. Modern historian Fawn Brodie has called the Book of Mormon a response to pressing cultural and environmental issues of Smith's times, saying that Smith composed the Book of Mormon drawing from scraps of information available to him. Dan Vogel, another historian, says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> is autobiographical in nature.|$|E

5|$|Exactly {{what part}} each {{played in the}} authorship is unknown. At the time, Grave {{asserted}} that he had authored the manifesto and that Kropotkin had revised it. Alternatively, Gregori Maximoff reported that Kropotkin had written the document and that Grave had merely advised minor alterations. George Woodcock noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> seems to be highly influenced by Kropotkin's common concerns and arguments against the German Empire, and so felt that the exact authorship was unimportant.|$|E
5|$|François Callebout {{wrote an}} organ version that was {{published}} in 2004 by Dr. J. Butz. Gabriel Dessauer explains in the preface <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> was conceived for oratorio choirs {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century, of up to 500 singers. The organ version enables smaller choirs to perform the music. It was premiered in 2003 by the Reger-Chor in St. Bonifatius, Wiesbaden, the parish to which the composer belonged during his studies in Wiesbaden. The organ was played by Ignace Michiels, organist at the St. Salvator Cathedral in Bruges.|$|E
5|$|Hemming singles out the conquests of England by Cnut and William the Conqueror {{as being}} {{especially}} damaging. He claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> only covers the lost estates that {{were assigned to}} support the cathedral chapter, but as he describes the loss of several manors that were listed in Domesday Book as belonging to the bishop, the work probably covers more than the author claims. It also contains a listing of amounts paid to King William to regain items the king had taken from the diocese. Worcester paid over 45.5 marks of gold to recover their belongings. Others singled out in the work as significant plunderers of Worcester's lands included Leofric, Earl of Mercia, {{and other members of}} his family.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Weinberg again {{found himself}} in a real estate dispute, {{threatening}} legal action against Monmouth County in connection with its attempt to repair damage to the Henry Hudson Trail in Atlantic Highlands following damage caused by Superstorm Sandy. Weinberg claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> done in creating that portion of the trail, augmented by Sandy, had caused significant damage to two properties he and his wife owned there. The issue was still ongoing in 2014.|$|E
5|$|In February 1959, formal {{authority}} for beginning construction was granted. However, while Menzies was on holiday, some {{officials from the}} Department of Treasury convinced ministers to withhold money needed for the lake, so {{the start of the}} construction was delayed. Once it started, progress was fast. At its peak, the number of people physically working on the construction in the lakes was between 400 and 500. John Overall, the Commissioner of the NCDC, promised Menzies <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> would be finished within four years, and he succeeded, despite the Prime Minister's scepticism. Equipment was quickly requisitioned.|$|E
5|$|Mihardja, a journalist-cum-literary {{editor who}} {{associated}} with the eccentric poet Chairil Anwar and the Socialist Party of Indonesia, wrote Atheis from May 1948 to February 1949. The Indonesian used in the novel was influenced by Sundanese and harkens back to earlier works by Minang writers, as opposed to Mihardja's contemporaries who attempted {{to distance themselves from}} the earlier style. Dealing mainly with faith, the novel also touches on the interactions between modernity and traditionalism. Although the writer insisted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> was meant to be realistic, symbolic representations from subjective meanings to the novel being an allegory have been advanced.|$|E

5000|$|Back in England, Slater studied Shakespeare and {{proposed}} a new variation of theory <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> attributed to Shakespeare were not his. In The Seven Shakespeares (1931) he argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> were actually written by seven different authors: Francis Bacon, Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, Sir Walter Raleigh, William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby, Christopher Marlowe, Mary Sidney, Countess of Pembroke, and Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland. This so-called [...] "group theory" [...] revived Delia Bacon's early model of collaborative authorship and brought {{together all the}} most popular recent candidates.|$|R
