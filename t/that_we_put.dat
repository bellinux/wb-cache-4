5|$|I think we’re {{going to}} have {{problems}} politically until we {{get some sort of}} third party movement or some voice out there that can put forth new ideas. Someone’s going to step up at some point and say we’ve had enough of this. The real issues are not being addressed and it’s time <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We might not win, but we can certainly influence the debate.|$|E
5|$|I {{think that}} the band went on... maybe not a tangent, {{but we had a}} goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And I think we showed too much. I think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E
25|$|One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, {{was on the}} show, and {{he threw}} in {{a few of his}} folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script. Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but things were {{different}} on radio then. They got enormous laughs, which just went on and on. We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.|$|E

2500|$|The 21 demands <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> up in 1980 {{are still}} relevant. Nothing was fulfilled. People {{still have to}} {{struggle}} {{to be treated with}} dignity. That's scandalous.|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{whole thing}} with the heart... there wasn't a real {{intention}} or a reason, it's just a collection of ideas <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> together. To me, we had our hearts broken by losing Layne and losing ourselves. And also {{it took a lot}} of that to get through this process and to even take the chance, and to stand-up and risk. It celebrates his life." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} McCormick's tour, Chief of Naval Operations Robert B. Carney {{looked for}} a {{successor}} who would be better at {{standing up to the}} British staff at SACLANT headquarters. [...] "I had felt a great deal of concern about the handling of the United States interests down there and in the Atlantic, vis-à-vis the British...I had felt that the United States viewpoint had been handled rather naively in some previous instances and that it was imperative <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> somebody down there who could take care of these interests." [...] Carney selected Admiral Jerauld Wright, who relieved McCormick on April 12, 1954.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Certainly you did,' {{returned}} David, warmly, 'but that's not the idea. Who said, <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> <b>put</b> {{the money}} together we could furnish an office, {{and make a}} show?' ...|$|R

2500|$|.....there surely is {{some common}} ground when both {{those who believe}} in choice and those who are opposed to {{abortion}} can come together and say, 'We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby'. Those are all things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> in the Democratic platform {{for the first time this}} year, and I think that's where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion. I think it's always a tragic situation. We should try to reduce these circumstances." ...|$|E
2500|$|The single's cover art was a still {{from the}} film Dunkirk (1958) {{featuring}} British actor Sean Barrett, praying but looking sufficiently {{as though he was}} holding his crotch to have the sleeve banned in the United States, where a photograph of the band backstage at the 1984 Glastonbury Festival, which had previously appeared on the gatefold inside the Hatful of Hollow compilation, was used instead. It is the only time a portrait of the band has appeared on the cover of one of their releases. Morrissey called it [...] "an abhorrent sleeve– and [...] the time and the dedication <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> into the sleeves and artwork, it was tearful when we finally saw the record..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Be the Twilight was {{recorded}} in Los Angeles with producer Paul Fox (XTC, Björk, The Sugarcubes, They Might Be Giants). The band wrote 45 songs for the album before traveling to Los Angeles, where they trimmed this down to 12. The songs were influenced by the band's surroundings {{at the time of}} recording, with Hudson stating [...] "here's a whole directness that exists in L.A. and I kind of feel <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> that in the record". Hudson said that after [...] "putting all the things you've ever experienced" [...] into Addicted Romantic, the band were able to record Be the Twilight [...] "more in the moment." [...] Be the Twilight took its name from Hudson's fear of the dark; Faker insisted they [...] "name the album after the twilight just to annoy him". Following the release of Be the Twilight, Faker embarked on an album tour, playing with fellow bands Children Collide and E.L.F. The tour commenced on 15 November 2007.|$|E

50|$|It {{is obvious}} that Metacube allows to store the amount of {{information}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> desire (each face shows the information <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have <b>put</b> in the Metacube), to select with the “touching” the information <b>that</b> <b>we</b> want (search).|$|R
2500|$|Despite having {{voted for}} the motion, Conservative Member of Parliament Daniel Petit {{declared}} {{that there might be}} a link, as Wong suggested. [...] "I think that the billion (dollars) <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> in [...] should have been put into education and integration of immigrants in Montreal", Petit said. Dimitri Soudas, press attaché for Conservative Prime Minister Harper, said [...] "The comments of Mr. Petit are unacceptable, he should retract them and it does not reflect in any case the position of the government", adding that Petit was met by the Prime Minister's cabinet on the subject. MPs of the House of Commons criticized him for his statements, including Michel Gauthier, of the Bloc Québécois, and Denis Coderre, of the Liberal Party of Canada, who demanded apologies. He offered them promptly. [...] "I made inappropriate remarks," [...] Petit said in a statement. [...] "I withdraw them entirely because you cannot draw any link between the integration of immigrants in Quebec and the terrible tragedy at Dawson College." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some initial {{military}} reactions {{seemed to}} dismiss the news {{as if it were}} of little importance, with one spokesperson comparing the verses to the presence of the phrase [...] "In God we Trust" [...] on United States currency. However General David Petraeus left no doubt that senior commanders, once apprised of the situation, considered the situation to be extremely serious. Delivering what news reports called a [...] "stinging criticism of the contractor," [...] Petraeus said that [...] "It is disturbing. This is a serious concern to me and to the other commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan because it indeed conveys a perception that is absolutely contrary to what we have sought to do." [...] Petraeus added that [...] "There’s a reason <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> people through cultural awareness training....I can assure you that there is much greater sensitivity among our troops about this sort of thing than apparently there is from the contractor." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "What {{was said}} in court was a defense {{argument}} made <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> a cloud over the White House, as if, one, we were inventing something or, two, making something up, in order to convince the jury {{that they ought to}} convict. And I think in any case where you feel that someone's making an argument that you are inventing something or improperly casting a cloud on someone, you respond. And we responded fairly and honestly by saying there was a cloud there caused by – not caused by us. And by Mr. Libby obstructing justice and lying about what happened, he had failed to remove the cloud. And sometimes when people tell the truth, clouds disappear. And sometimes they don't. But when you don't know what's happening, that's a problem. And so {{the fact that there was}} a cloud over anyone was not our doing. It was the facts of the case. It was the facts of the case. It was aggravated by Mr. Libby telling falsehoods. And that's what we said. We're not going to add to that or subtract to that. That's what we said in court, and that's the context in which we said it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Won't it?" [...] I said, innocently. [...] "Then, after <b>that,</b> suppose <b>we</b> <b>put</b> in some {{of these}} {{coloured}} pebbles--just to mark the divisions between the different kinds of flowers, you know. That'll have a very pretty effect." ...|$|R
60|$|Let us make {{a slight}} sketch of our amiable friend, Mr. Felix Nixon. We are {{strongly}} disposed to think, <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> <b>put</b> {{him in this}} place, he will answer our purpose without another word of comment.|$|R

2500|$|In June, the Harris {{campaign}} {{received a}} legal bill {{for thousands of}} dollars that contained a reference to [...] "DOJ subpoena". Later, an ex-aide told the Associated Press that Harris had received a grand jury subpoena from federal investigators, but kept it from her top advisers, prompting several staff members to quit when they found out. On June 8, 2006, Harris's fourth chief of staff, Fred Asbell, left in order to pursue a [...] "business opportunity". Asbell said he'd [...] "greatly enjoyed" [...] his time with the campaign and he would remain in a consultant position. On July 12, 2006, Harris's campaign spokesman Chris Christopher Ingram left the campaign. The next day he was followed by campaign manager Glenn Hodas, field director Pat Thomas, political director Brian Brooks and Deputy field director John K. Byers, who all resigned from her campaign. Hodas cited Harris's [...] "tantrums" [...] and [...] "increasingly erratic behavior" [...] as his reasons for leaving. An anonymous campaign worker described Harris as [...] "very difficult to work with. The more <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> her out there, the more she shot herself in the foot." ...|$|E

40|$|Conor McHugh and Jonathan Way argue <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should <b>put</b> fittingness {{rather than}} reasons first {{because we can}} provide {{an account of the}} evaluative in terms of the {{normative}} only if <b>we</b> <b>put</b> fittingness rather than reasons first.

60|$|I am {{persuaded that}} none of these warriors really had kinsmen in America, but that they all pretended to have them, out of politeness to us, and that they {{believed}} each other.
