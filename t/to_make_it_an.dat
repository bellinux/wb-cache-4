5|$|Although a {{comic book}} about sentient {{chickens}} could have been fantasy or science fiction, he decided <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> outright drama. The storyline eventually became too serious for a title as silly as Ultimate Chicken Story, so he changed it to Elmer. The story was fully planned when he began work on the first issue, and he wrote it in English because he wanted an international audience.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Crawford was {{included}} in an Australian team which toured North America. The team was organised by Edgar Mayne, a South Australian batsman who tried to secure backing from the Australian Board of Control <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> official representative team, but the Board refused to do so. In all matches, Crawford scored over 1,000 runs and took over 200 wickets, and he was particularly effective as a bowler in the matches designated first-class. He later stated {{that this was the}} best tour he had been on; more press rumours suggested that he would return to England {{at the conclusion of the}} tour, but he returned to Australia with the rest of the team.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Kepple, {{one of the}} {{original}} Altoona & Wopsononock directors, was elected president of the newly organized company. The board remained largely unchanged, although Shellenberger finally severed his association with the railroad. It remained unprofitable, and Davis, in turn, sold the line to Sigmund Morris, of Altoona. Morris had incorporated the Altoona Northern Railroad on November 7, 1912 to acquire the line, and the Altoona, Juniata and Northern was merged into it on January 16, 1913. Morris planned to convert the railroad to , electrify it <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> interurban, and extend it to connect with the Beech Creek Railroad (a subsidiary of the New York Central Railroad) at Patton. However, Morris was unable to execute these plans. A group of New York City investors took over the railroad about 1916. They converted the railroad to standard gauge, operating initially with ex-Pennsylvania Railroad 2-6-0s, but replacing them with Heislers when the 2-6-0s were found to be unsuitable for the track.|$|E

5|$|On April9, CSU also {{released}} its first quantitative forecast for the 2015 hurricane season, predicting 7 named storms, 3 hurricanes, 1 major hurricane, and a cumulative ACE index of 40 units. The combination of cooler than average {{waters in the}} tropical and subtropical Atlantic, {{as well as a}} developing El Niño predicted to reach at least moderate intensity, were expected to favor one of the least active seasons since the mid-1990s. The probabilities of a major hurricane striking various coastal areas across the Atlantic were lower than average, although CSU stressed that it only takes one landfalling hurricane <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> active season for residents involved. On April13, North Carolina State University (NCSU) {{released its}} forecast, predicting a near record-low season with just 4 to 6 named storms, 1 to 3 hurricanes, and 1 major hurricane.|$|E
5|$|With the {{prospects}} of {{a link between the}} navigation and the Basingstoke Canal being constructed, the undertaking was valued at £24,000, and D'Arcy sold a half share in it to his agent, George Hollis. He then sold the other half to him, and moved to Ireland. Hollis became the sole proprietor from 1804, having bought out his sleeping partner. Throughout its life, the navigation had almost been a monopoly, but Hollis planned to end this, and obtained an Act of Parliament in 1802, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> open navigation, where anyone could use it on payment of the appropriate tolls. These were laid down in the Act, ending the setting of tolls by the Commissioners. The Act also specified that he had three years to put the river in order, which he appears to have achieved, since he then leased it to a group of merchants.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} {{cinematic}} scenes {{was written by}} Naoki Mori, who joined the project for one and a quarter years in his role: the cinematic director was Shigeki Yoshida, who was brought on {{at the same time}} as and worked on the storyboards with Mori. The initial script was proposed by Fujibayashi based on his perception of the game's structure. As the game's theme was the use of the sword, and the sword most associated with the series was the Master Sword, the team decided <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> origin story for the weapon. An early element was whether to incorporate the creation of Hyrule, while also needing to explain the creation of Skyloft: this initial stage of story development ended up being difficult as their initial story plans were full of contradictions to established series lore due to them wanting to create an origin story for the entire series. These issues were further complicated by the third year of development with the necessity of finalizing the gameplay and environments. Feigning illness, Fujibayashi shut himself away in a hotel room and wrote the synopsis in a single day. Mori wrote the dialogue based on Fujibayashi's synopsis, who needed to work out the fine details with Fujibayashi. A scene Fujibayashi was intent on including was where Zelda jumped from the edge of Skyloft and Link caught her: this was fitted in for the two characters after the end of Link's exam. The early part of the story was quite different from earlier Zelda titles, playing out in a similar way to a school drama. Once the script was finished, it was handed to Yoshida so his team could create the cinematics. The total number of cinematics was estimated as 79, coming to over 120 minutes.|$|E

25|$|The {{growth of}} other shipyards, {{particularly}} Chatham Dockyard on the River Medway, eventually threatened Deptford's supremacy, {{and by the}} early seventeenth century the possibility of closing and selling Deptford yard was being discussed.

Attention shifted to the Medway and defences and facilities were constructed at Chatham and Sheerness.|$|E

25|$|The lack of {{organization}} {{and efficiency of}} early law enforcement was often a source of public controversy. Because of this, a parliamentary committee was appointed to investigate {{the current system of}} policing. Upon Sir Robert Peel being appointed as Home Secretary in 1822, he established a second and more effective committee, and acted upon its findings. Robert Peel, believing that the way to standardise the police was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> official paid profession, to organise it in a civilian fashion, and to make it answerable to the public. After he presented his ideas to Parliament, they were approved and made official with the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829.|$|E
25|$|Other, {{less well}} characterised substrate-binding sites also exist. One such site (the DEF site) is {{formed by the}} {{activation}} loop (when in the active conformation) and the MAP kinase-specific insert below it. This site can accommodate peptides with an FxFP consensus sequence, typically downstream of the phosphorylation site. Note that the latter site can only be found in proteins that need to selectively recognize the active MAP kinases, thus they are almost exclusively found in substrates. Different motifs may cooperate with each other, as in the Elk family of transcription factors, that possess both a D-motif and an FxFP motif. The presence of an FxFP motif in the KSR1 scaffold protein also serves <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> ERK1/2 substrate, providing a negative feedback mechanism to set the correct strength of ERK1/2 activation.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the United States Marine Corps (USMC) begins with the {{founding}} of the Continental Marines on 10 November 1775 to conduct ship-to-ship fighting, provide shipboard security and discipline enforcement, and assist in landing forces. Its mission evolved with changing military doctrine and foreign policy of the United States. Owing to the availability of Marine forces at sea, the United States Marine Corps has served in nearly every conflict in United States history. It attained prominence when its theories and practice of amphibious warfare proved prescient, and ultimately formed a cornerstone of the Pacific Theater of World War II. By the early 20th century, the Marine Corps would become one of the dominant theorists and practitioners of amphibious warfare. Its ability to rapidly respond on short notice to expeditionary crises has made and continues <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> important tool for American foreign policy.|$|E

25|$|The {{area that}} is now Basin Reserve was {{originally}} a lake (known as the Basin Lake), and there were plans to connect it to the sea by a canal <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> alternative inner city harbour, with major warehouses and factories alongside it. However, the massive 1855 Wairarapa earthquake uplifted the area nearly 1.8 m and turned the lake into a swamp. Due to the colonists' English roots, sport, particularly cricket, was {{a vital part of}} the community's way to relax. However, no land had been allocated by the city planners for recreational reserves. Although natural grounds, such as the Te Aro flat, provided a small area for matches, the colonists wanted more recreational land than what they had. The matter became more dire as buildings began to be erected on these flat plains, as flat land was hard to find in the mountainous Wellington. So after the 1855 earthquake, which historians estimate measured magnitude 8, influential citizens seized the chance in 1857 to suggest that the new land be drained and made into a recreational reserve. The Wellington council accepted the proposal and beginning on 3 February 1863 prisoners from the Mount Cook Gaol began to level and drain the new land. The swamp was drained by September and a fence was placed around the entire area along with hedges. However, massive population influxes from 1863 until 1866 (caused mostly by the Parliament being situated in Wellington) hampered construction on the Basin Reserve as workers were pulled to other areas.|$|E
