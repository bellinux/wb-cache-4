500|$|Del Toro {{had never}} shot a film {{in less than}} 115 days, but had only 103 to shoot Pacific Rim. In order to achieve this, del Toro {{scheduled}} a splinter unit that he could direct early in the day, before main unit, and on his off-days. The director worked 17 to 18 hours a day, seven days a week, {{for much of the}} schedule. Del Toro took a new approach to directing actors, allowing [...] "looser" [...] movements and improvisation; the director maintained tight control over the production: [...] "Everything, 100% goes <b>through</b> <b>me</b> sooner or later. I do not delegate anything. Some people like it, some people don't, {{but it has to be}} done that way." ...|$|E
500|$|Vivien saw Barney as a muse and as Barney put it, [...] "she {{had found}} new {{inspiration}} <b>through</b> <b>me,</b> almost without knowing me." [...] Barney felt Vivien had cast {{her as a}} femme fatale and that she wanted [...] "to lose herself... entirely in suffering" [...] {{for the sake of}} her art. Vivien also believed in fidelity, which Barney was unwilling to agree to. While Barney was visiting her family in Washington, D.C. in 1901, Vivien stopped answering her letters. Barney tried to get her back for years, at one point persuading a friend, operatic mezzo-soprano Emma Calvé, to sing under Vivien's window so she could throw a poem (wrapped around a bouquet of flowers) up to Vivien on her balcony. Both flowers and poem were intercepted and returned by a governess.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Bass {{stated that}} he had faith Timberlake would return after six months off to record another album with NSYNC, and that he felt betrayed by Timberlake's 2004 {{decision}} to pursue his solo career instead. Bass has {{also said that he}} has little hope for a reunion, since Timberlake has [...] "made it clear that he wouldn't be interested in discussing another album any time soon." [...] Despite these statements, Bass has denied that he harbors any ill feelings towards Timberlake, saying: [...] "At that time... it did feel like betrayal. I felt heartbroken. All these emotions went <b>through</b> <b>me.</b> Today, I’m really happy, and Justin and I are really great friends. I don’t hate him at all. And I understand what he was going through, and it was as hard for him as it was for any of us." ...|$|E
500|$|He lived a frugal existence, {{his only}} source of income being a £20-a-week {{retainer}} he received from Island Records (...) [...] At one point he could not afford {{a new pair of}} shoes. He would often disappear for days, sometimes turning up unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: [...] "He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back." [...] Nick's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, once saw him on a tube train in London and felt he was seriously clinically depressed. [...] "There was something about him which suggested that he would have looked straight <b>through</b> <b>me</b> and not registered me at all. So I turned around." ...|$|E
500|$|The story also {{deals with}} Alison Bechdel's own {{struggle}} with her sexual identity, reaching a catharsis in {{the realization that}} she is a lesbian and her coming out to her parents. The memoir frankly examines her sexual development, including transcripts from her childhood diary, anecdotes about masturbation, and tales of her first sexual experiences with her girlfriend, Joan. In addition to their common homosexuality, Alison and Bruce Bechdel share obsessive-compulsive tendencies and artistic leanings, albeit with opposing aesthetic senses: [...] "I was Spartan to my father's Athenian. Modern to his Victorian. Butch to his nelly. Utilitarian to his aesthete." [...] This opposition was a source of tension in their relationship, as both tried to express their dissatisfaction with their given gender roles: [...] "Not only were we inverts, we were inversions of each other. While I was trying to compensate for something unmanly in him, he was attempting to express something feminine <b>through</b> <b>me.</b> It was a war of cross-purposes, and so doomed to perpetual escalation." [...] However, shortly before Bruce Bechdel's death, he and his daughter have a conversation in which Bruce confesses some of his sexual history; this is presented as a partial resolution to the conflict between father and daughter.|$|E

500|$|On June 5, 2017, Dylan's Nobel Lecture {{was posted}} on the Nobel prize website. The New York Times pointed out that, in order to collect the prize’s 8 million Swedish krona ($900,000), the Swedish Academy’s rules {{stipulate}} the laureate [...] "must deliver a lecture within {{six months of the}} official ceremony, which would have made Mr. Dylan’s deadline June 10." [...] Academy secretary Danius commented: [...] "The speech is extraordinary and, as one might expect, eloquent. Now that the lecture has been delivered, the Dylan adventure is coming to a close." [...] In his essay, Dylan writes about the impact that three important books made on him: Herman Melville's Moby Dick, Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front and Homer's The Odyssey. He concludes: [...] "Our songs are alive {{in the land of the}} living. But songs are unlike literature. They’re meant to be sung, not read. The words in Shakespeare’s plays were meant to be acted on the stage. Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be sung, not read on a page. And I hope some of you get the chance to listen to these lyrics the way they were intended to be heard: in concert or on record or however people are listening to songs these days. I return once again to Homer, who says, 'Sing in me, oh Muse, and <b>through</b> <b>me</b> tell the story'." [...] Alan Pasqua provided the uncredited piano accompaniment for the recorded speech.|$|E
500|$|Pacers coach Rick Carlisle {{said after}} the game, [...] "I felt like I was {{fighting}} for my life out there." [...] One reporter who attempted to stop Tinsley from entering the stands recalled that the player [...] "went <b>through</b> <b>me</b> like I was butter", and then NBA Commissioner David Stern, watching the game on TV, recalled that he said, [...] "Holy [...]" [...] (O'Neal later said, [...] "As bad as it looked on TV, {{it was at least}} 20 times worse in person.") Pacers assistant coach Chuck Person compared the situation to being [...] "trapped in a gladiator-type scene where the fans were the lions and we were just trying to escape with our lives. That's how it felt. That there was no exit. That you had to fight your way out." [...] Players' children and others in the audience cried from fear and shock. Derrick Coleman stood near Brown and Brown's ball boy son to protect them. The remaining seconds of the game were called off and the Pacers were awarded the 97–82 win. Fans booed the Indiana players as they were escorted from the court by officials and security, and continued to throw beverages and other objects (including a folding chair that nearly hit O'Neal) at them as they walked under the tunnel to the locker room. No players from either team spoke to the media before leaving the arena. Eventually, police officers were able to swarm the arena, threatening to handcuff those who wouldn't leave. Nine spectators were injured, and two were taken to the hospital.|$|E

Allah has promised them (perpetrators) hell, and we shall send them there."

Together, in a huge choral number, Jacopo, Lucrezia, Pisano, Barbarigo, Loredano, and the people of Venice each express their feelings. Jacopo begins: O padre, figli, sposa / [...] "Father, children, wife, I bid you a last farewell", and the scene ends with Jacopo escorted onto the galley while Lucrezia faints in Pisana's arms.|$|E

After his release from prison in 2009, he was introduced by his manager, Pete Farmer, to music executives Ron Fair and Jimmy Iovine at Geffen and Interscope Records. DeBarge sang a cappella in his audition for the label. He later said of the meeting and audition, [...] "we put a plan together and the minute I stepped into the studio I was so nervous, but I felt so much power just coming <b>through</b> <b>me</b> soon as I hit the microphone it was like, it was still there". He subsequently signed a recording deal with the label and began working on Second Chance.|$|E

2500|$|Emerson, Lake & Palmer {{conflicted}} between Emerson's {{interest in}} complex, classically-influenced music and Lake's more straightforward rock tastes. Lake complained that Emerson chose {{to play in}} keys that were not {{a good fit for}} his voice. During the making of the band's second album Tarkus, Lake initially rejected the title track, but was persuaded to record it following a band meeting with management, which ended in the addition of an original Lake tune, [...] "Battlefield", into the suite. Lake's track [...] "From the Beginning", released on Trilogy in 1972, had no particular source of inspiration; [...] "I just felt an inspiration to do it, and it flowed <b>through</b> <b>me</b> in a natural way. My hands fell upon these very unusual chords... It was kind of a gift". It was released as a single, and reached number 39 in the US.|$|E
2500|$|From 1920 to 1922, Sorge {{lived in}} Solingen, in present-day North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. He was joined there by Christiane Gerlach, ex-wife of Dr Kurt Albert Gerlach, a wealthy {{communist}} {{and professor of}} political science in Kiel, who had taught Sorge. Christine Gerlach later remembered about meeting Sorge for the first time: “It was as if a stroke of lightning ran <b>through</b> <b>me.</b> In this one second something awoke in me that had slumbered until now, something dangerous, dark, inescapable….” Sorge and Christiane married in May 1921. In 1922, he was relocated to Frankfurt, where he gathered intelligence about the business community. In the summer of 1923, he took part in the Erste Marxistische Arbeitswoche ("First Marxist Work Week" [...] conference) in Ilmenau. Sorge continued his work as a journalist, and also helped organize the library of the Institute for Social Research, a new Marxist think-tank in Frankfurt.|$|E
2500|$|... "Via, Veritas, Vita" [...] is a Latin phrase {{which means}} “The Way, The Truth, and The Life.” Chosen by the University as its motto, this phrase is {{attributed}} to Jesus Christ and {{is found in the}} Gospel of John chapter 14, verse 6, which reads “5Thomas said to him, [...] "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?" [...] 6Jesus answered, [...] "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except <b>through</b> <b>me.</b> 7If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him." [...] (New International Version) [...] The choice of the motto is firmly rooted in the University’s belief that religious instruction, particularly in the teachings of Jesus Christ, is essential to the moral development of every young person. [...] Incidentally, the motto has been adopted by the Province of Negros Oriental by incorporating it in its provincial seal.|$|E
