5|$|While most planets with orbital {{periods of}} less than 10 days have almost {{circular}} orbits, HD 217107 b has a somewhat eccentric orbit, and its discoverers hypothesized <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> due to the gravitational influence of a second planet in the system {{at a distance of}} several astronomical units (AU). Confirmation of the existence of a second planet, HD 217107 c, followed in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{bonds between}} atoms were now explained, by Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1916, as the {{interactions}} between their constituent electrons. As the chemical properties of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law, in 1919 the American chemist Irving Langmuir suggested <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of electron shells about the nucleus.|$|E

5|$|Throughout her career, Godwin worked {{consistently}} {{with her}} agent, John Hawkins, but worked with several different publishing houses. Godwin's early books were published by Knopf. After the editor for The Perfectionists, David Segal, died suddenly {{of a heart}} attack, Robert Gottlieb from Knopf became her editor for her next four books. Godwin credits Gottlieb {{for much of the}} success of her early works. Later on, when Godwin's then-recent books were less widely read, USA Today commented <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> in part because she was no longer working with Gottlieb. After Knopf, Godwin contracted with Viking, who offered larger advances and more publicity for her books.|$|E
5|$|After some deliberation, with {{opinions}} {{sought and}} obtained from Percival Keith, Norris Bradbury, Darol Froman, Elmer E. Kirkpatrick, Kenneth Nichols and Edward Teller, {{it was decided}} <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> done safely if appropriate precautions were taken. On 28 November 1946, the K-25 plant began producing 94 percent product. At this point, they ran into a serious flaw in the gaseous diffusion concept: enrichment in uranium-235 also enriched the product in the unwanted and fairly useless uranium-234, {{making it difficult to}} raise the enrichment to 95 percent. On 6 December 1946, production was dropped back to a steady 2.56kg per day enriched to 93.7 percent uranium-235, along with 1.9 percent uranium-234. This was regarded as satisfactory product by the Los Alamos Laboratory, so on 26 December 1946 enrichment activity at Y-12 was curtailed. The Manhattan Project ended a few days later. Responsibility for the K-25 facility then passed to the new Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947.|$|E
5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} {{diffusers}} and pumps paled into insignificance besides {{those with the}} porous barrier. In order to work, the gaseous diffusion process required a barrier with microscopic holes, but not subject to plugging. It had to be extremely porous, but strong enough to handle the high pressures. And, like everything else, it had to resist corrosion from uranium hexafluoride. The latter criterion suggested a nickel barrier. Foster C. Nix at the Bell Telephone Laboratories experimented with nickel powder, while Edward O. Norris at the C. O. Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler at the City College of New York worked on a design with electroplated metallic nickel. Norris was an English interior decorator, who had developed a very fine metal mesh for use with a spray gun. Their design appeared too brittle and fragile for the proposed use, particularly on the higher stages of enrichment, but there was hope <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> overcome.|$|E

5|$|Otjes's {{approach}} is more empirical {{than that of}} many contributors to Political Animals and Animal Politics. He examines the Dutch Party for the Animals (PvdD), which, in 2006, won two seats in the House of Representatives. Otjes explores whether the PvdD's presence has changed {{the amount of time}} more established parties spent on animal issues by examining both parliamentary speeches and motions before and after the introduction of the PvdD members. He finds that established parties began to talk more about animal issues in 2006, and <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> attributed to conflict between the PvdD and the established parties. Though Otjes allows that his study's relevance may seem limited, he concludes that smaller parties can affect government agenda by remaining focused on their own primary concern.|$|E
5|$|Sections of {{the track}} were removed and relaid at other {{athletics}} venues, and the internal ground level was lowered {{to make way for}} an additional tier of seating, on terracing already constructed then buried for the original configuration. The three temporary stands with a total capacity of 16,000 were dismantled, and replaced with a permanent structure of similar design to the existing one at the southern end. This work took nearly a year to complete and added 23,000 permanent seats, increasing the capacity of the converted stadium by 7,000 to approximately 48,000. Manchester City F.C. moved to the ground in time {{for the start of the}} 2003–04 season. The total cost of this conversion was in excess of £40 million, with the track, pitch and seating conversion being funded by the city council at a cost of £22million; and the installation of bars, restaurants and corporate entertainment areas throughout the stadium being funded by the football club at a cost of £20million. The Games had made a small operating surplus, and Sport England agreed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> reinvested in converting the athletics warm-up track adjacent to the main stadium into the 6,000 seat Manchester Regional Arena at a cost of £3.5 million.|$|E

25|$|The Book of Revelation (7:4–8), {{mentions}} that {{people from the}} twelve tribes of Israel will be sealed.

It has been suggested <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> because of their pagan practices.

25|$|Galen {{believed}} {{there to be}} no distinction between the mental and the physical.

Galen proposed organs within the body to be responsible for specific functions, rather than individual parts. According to Galen, the Stoics' lack of scientific justification discredited their claims of the separateness of mind and body, which is why he spoke so strongly against them.|$|E
