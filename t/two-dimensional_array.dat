Computations on <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>arrays</b> such as {{matrices}} {{and images}} {{are one of}} the most fundamental and ubiquitous things in computational science and its vast application areas, but development of efficient parallel programs on <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>arrays</b> is known to be hard. To solve this problem, we have proposed a skeletal framework on <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>arrays</b> based on the theory of constructive algorithmics. It supports users, even with little knowledge about parallel machines, to develop systematically both correct and efficient parallel programs on <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>arrays.</b> In this paper, we apply our framework to the matrix-convolutions often used in image filters and difference methods. We show the efficacy of the framework by giving a general parallel program for the matrix-convolutions described with the skeletons, and a theorem that optimizes the general program into an application-specific one. ...|$|R

25|$|All {{semiconductors}} {{are subject}} to optical charge carrier generation. This is typically an undesired effect, so most semiconductors are packaged in light blocking material. Photodiodes are intended to sense light(photodetector), so they are packaged in materials that allow light to pass, and are usually PIN (the kind of diode most sensitive to light). A photodiode {{can be used in}} solar cells, in photometry, or in optical communications. Multiple photodiodes may be packaged in a single device, either as a linear array or as a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>array.</b> These arrays {{should not be confused with}} charge-coupled devices.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that this {{function}} only computes the path-cost, not the actual path. We will get to the path soon. This, like the Fibonacci-numbers example, is horribly slow since it wastes time recomputing the same shortest paths over and over. However, we can compute it much faster in a bottom-up fashion if we store path-costs in a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>array</b> q rather than using a function. This avoids recomputation; before computing the cost of a path, we check the array q to see if the path cost is already there.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Computations on <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>arrays</b> such as {{matrices}} {{and images}} {{are one of}} the most fundamental and ubiquitous things in computational science and its vast application areas, but development of efficient parallel programs on twodimensional arrays is known to be hard. In this paper, we propose a compositional framework that supports users, even with little knowledge about parallel machines, to develop both correct and efficient parallel programs on dense <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>arrays</b> systematically. The key feature of our framework is a novel use of the abidetree representation of <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>arrays.</b> The presentation not only inherits the advantages of tree representations of matrices where recursive blocked algorithms can be defined to achieve better performance, but also supports transformational development of parallel programs and architecture-independent implementation owing to its solid theoretical foundation- the theory of constructive algorithmics.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} low-temperature transport properties of <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>arrays</b> of superconductor [...] normal-metal [...] superconductor (SNS) junctions. It {{has been found}} that in <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>arrays</b> of SNS junctions (i) a change in the energy spectrum within an interval of the order of the Thouless energy is observed even when the thermal broadening far exceeds the Thouless energy for a single SNS junction; (ii) the manifestation of the subharmonic energy gap structure (SGS) with high harmonic numbers is possible even if the energy relaxation length is smaller than that required for the realization of a multiple Andreev reflection in a single SNS junction. These results point to the synchronization of a great number of SNS junctions.

25|$|An S-layer (surface layer) is a cell surface protein layer {{found in}} many {{different}} bacteria and in some archaea, where it serves as the cell wall. All S-layers {{are made up of}} a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>array</b> of proteins and have a crystalline appearance, the symmetry of which differs between species. The exact function of S-layers is unknown, but {{it has been suggested that}} they act as a partial permeability barrier for large substrates. For example, an S-layer could conceivably keep extracellular proteins near the cell membrane by preventing their diffusion away from the cell. In some pathogenic species, an S-layer may help to facilitate survival within the host by conferring protection against host defence mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Shellsort {{was invented}} by Donald Shell in 1959. It {{improves}} upon bubble sort and insertion sort by moving out of order elements more than one position at a time. The concept behind Shellsort is that both of these algorithms perform in O(kn) time, where k is the greatest distance between two out-of-place elements. This means that generally, they perform in O(n2), but for data that is mostly sorted, {{with only a few}} elements out of place, they perform faster. So, by first sorting elements far away, and progressively shrinking the gap between the elements to sort, the final sort computes much faster. One implementation can be described as arranging the data sequence in a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>array</b> and then sorting the columns of the array using insertion sort.|$|E
25|$|Ocular aberrations are {{generally}} measured using a wavefront sensor, {{and the most}} commonly used type of wavefront sensor is the Shack-Hartmann. Ocular aberrations are caused by spatial phase nonuniformities in the wavefront exiting the eye. In a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, these are measured by placing a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>array</b> of small lenses (lenslets) in a pupil plane conjugate to the eye's pupil, and a CCD chip at the back focal plane of the lenslets. The lenslets cause spots to be focused onto the CCD chip, and the positions of these spots are calculated using a centroiding algorithm. The positions of these spots are compared with the positions of reference spots, and the displacements between the two are used to determine the local curvature of the wavefront—an estimate of the phase nonuniformities causing aberration.|$|E

2500|$|This {{proof is}} {{analogous}} to Cantor's diagonal argument. One may visualize a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>array</b> with one column and one row for each natural number, as indicated in the table above. The value of f(i,j) is placed at column i, row j. Because f {{is assumed to be}} a total computable function, any element of the array can be calculated using f. The construction of the function g can be visualized using the main diagonal of this array. [...] If the array has a 0 at position (i,i), then g(i) is 0. Otherwise, g(i) is undefined. The contradiction {{comes from the fact that}} there is some column e of the array corresponding to g itself. Now assume f was the halting function h, if g(e) is defined (g(e) = 0 in this case), g(e) halts so f(e,e) = 1. [...] But g(e) = 0 only when f(e,e) = 0, contradicting f(e,e) = 1. Similarly, if g(e) is not defined, then halting function f(e,e) = 0, which leads to g(e) = 0 under gs construction. This contradicts the assumption of g(e) not being defined. In both cases contradiction arises. Therefore any arbitrary computable function f cannot be the halting function h.|$|E
