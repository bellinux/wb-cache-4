This medication may cause withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt withdrawal or rapid tapering, which in some cases {{have been known to}} cause seizures, as well as marked delirium similar to that produced by the anticholinergic tropane alkaloids of Datura (scopolamine and atropine). The discontinuation of this medication may also cause a reaction called rebound anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Boston {{lacked a}} regular supply of fresh meat, and many horses needed hay. On May 21, Gage ordered {{a party to}} go to Grape Island, in the outer harbor, and bring hay to Boston. When the Continentals on the {{mainland}} noticed this, they took alarm, and the militia were called out. As the British party arrived, they came under fire from the militia. The militia set fire to a barn on the island, destroying 80 tons of hay, and prevented the British from <b>taking</b> <b>more</b> than 3 tons.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his lack}} of {{performance}} in the Tests, Davidson showed his potential with consistent performance throughout the tour. He compiled 944runs at 41.04 during the tour and amassed five half centuries and a century. He scored three fifties {{in the last month}} of the tour, and after missing his maiden first-class century with 95 against Lancashire, he broke through with 104* against Somerset at County Ground, Taunton. He also took 50 wickets at 20.96 with the ball. Davidson was steady with the ball, never <b>taking</b> <b>more</b> than three wickets in an innings. He ranked seventh among the Australians in both run-scoring and wicket-taking.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{campaign}} in France, Kesselring's Luftflotte 2 was committed to the Battle of Britain. Luftflotte 2 was initially responsible for the bombing of southeastern England and the London area but as the battle progressed, command responsibility shifted, with Generalfeldmarschall Hugo Sperrle's Luftflotte 3 <b>taking</b> <b>more</b> responsibility for the night-time Blitz attacks while Luftflotte 2 conducted the main daylight operations. Kesselring {{was involved in the}} planning of numerous raids, including the Coventry Blitz of November 1940.|$|E
5|$|Greenup {{served as}} clerk {{of the first}} Kentucky {{statehood}} convention in Danville in 1784. He was elected as a delegate to the second and sixth statehood conventions in 1785 and 1788, respectively, and was a trustee {{of the city of}} Danville in 1787. H.E. Everman, biographer of fellow delegate James Garrard, noted that despite Greenup's excellent legal background and legislative experience, his lack of oratorical skills prevented him from <b>taking</b> <b>more</b> of a leadership role in the conventions.|$|E

5|$|In another two-day non-first-class match, Scotland batted {{better than}} in Edinburgh after being sent in to bat, but still lost. Tom Crosskey top-scored with 49 in the hosts' 178, before Bradman top-scored with 123 in his last match in Britain and McCool, {{promoted}} to open, made 108, while Johnson made 95 after being promoted to No. 5. Scotland then made 142 in some light-hearted cricket in which wicketkeeper Tallon took two wickets and stand-in gloveman Johnson stumped a Scottish batsman off Ring. Bradman allowed his non-regular bowlers opportunities with the ball, and the wickets were shared, with nobody <b>taking</b> <b>more</b> than four.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{had a more}} {{productive}} campaign during the 1952–53 season, scoring 470 runs at 33.57 and taking 23 wickets at 26.26 in nine matches. He broke through for his first first-class century in three years when he made 169 against New South Wales, {{but it was not}} enough to prevent an innings defeat. He scored 60 and took a match total of 5/102 in a match for Victoria against the touring South Africans early in the season, but this was not enough for him to regain his Test position. He bowled with steady results throughout the season, never <b>taking</b> <b>more</b> than three wickets in an innings and five in a match.|$|E
5|$|The fulmarine petrels are generalists, {{which for}} the most part take many species of fish and crustacea. The giant petrels, uniquely for Procellariiformes, will feed on land, eating the carrion of other seabirds and seals. They will also attack the chicks of other seabirds. The diet of the giant petrels varies {{according}} to sex, with the females <b>taking</b> <b>more</b> krill and the males more carrion. All the fulmarine petrels readily feed on fisheries discards at sea, a habit that has been implicated in (but not proved to have caused) the expansion in range of the northern fulmar in the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|The {{human and}} {{environmental}} {{costs of the}} Gold Rush were substantial. Native Americans, dependent on traditional hunting, gathering and agriculture, became the victims of starvation and disease, as gravel, silt and toxic chemicals from prospecting operations killed fish and destroyed habitats. The surge in the mining population also resulted in the disappearance of game and food gathering locales as gold camps and other settlements were built amidst them. Later farming spread to supply the settlers' camps, <b>taking</b> <b>more</b> land away from the Native Americans.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} initially {{consisted of}} present-day Utah, most of Nevada, and portions of Colorado and Wyoming. On February 28, 1861, {{the creation of}} Colorado Territory took land from {{the eastern side of}} Utah Territory. Nevada Territory was organized from the western section of Utah Territory on March 2, 1861. Also on that date, Nebraska Territory gained area from the northeastern part of Utah Territory. Nevada Territory gained area from Utah Territory on July 14, 1862, and again on May 5, 1866, after becoming a state. Wyoming Territory was created on July 25, 1868, from Nebraska Territory, <b>taking</b> <b>more</b> area from the northeast corner, giving Utah Territory its final borders.|$|E
5|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of benzodiazepines that tolerance to therapeutic effects develops relatively quickly while many adverse effects persist. Tolerance develops to hypnotic and myorelexant effects within days to weeks, and to anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects within weeks to months. Therefore, benzodiazepines {{are unlikely to}} be effective long-term treatments for sleep and anxiety. While BZD therapeutic effects disappear with tolerance, depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist. Several studies have confirmed that long-term benzodiazepines are not significantly different from placebo for sleep or anxiety. This may explain why patients commonly increase doses over time and many eventually take more than one type of benzodiazepine after the first loses effectiveness. Additionally, because tolerance to benzodiazepine sedating effects develops more quickly than does tolerance to brainstem depressant effects, those <b>taking</b> <b>more</b> benzodiazepines to achieve desired effects may suffer sudden respiratory depression, hypotension or death. Most patients with anxiety disorders and PTSD have symptoms that persist for at least several months, making tolerance to therapeutic effects a distinct problem for them and necessitating the need for more effective long-term treatment (e.g., psychotherapy, serotonergic antidepressants).|$|E

5|$|After being omitted in {{the opening}} tour match against Worcestershire, Davidson made his debut on English soil against Leicestershire. He scored 63, {{featuring}} in a century partnership with Harvey, before taking 2/23 and 0/35 in an innings victory. In the next match against Yorkshire, he removed Len Hutton, regarded as the best batsman {{in the world at}} the time. In the nine first-class matches leading up to the Tests, Davidson performed steadily without being spectacular. He scored two fifties and passed 20 in every completed innings to aggregate 317 runs at 45.28, and took 17 wickets at 22.12, <b>taking</b> <b>more</b> than two wickets in an innings on only one occasion. That occasion was against the Marylebone Cricket Club, which was a virtual England Test team, while Australia fielded their strongest possible team. In what was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests, Davidson took 2/17 and 3/49, removing Trevor Bailey, Godfrey Evans, Johnny Wardle, Tom Graveney and leading batsman Denis Compton.|$|E
5|$|After the {{resumption}} of play, Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 without adding to his lunch score, ending an 87-run partnership with Miller, and bringing Lindwall to the crease at 416/5. Miller and Lindwall attacked at every opportunity before the declaration. Miller's innings was noted for its driving, and he was out for 74, playing a hook shot that was caught by Bedser at square leg from Laker in pursuit of quick runs. He was followed by Lindwall, who ran out of his crease in attempt to hit Laker across the line to the boundary, missed, and was stumped for 25, prompting Bradman to declare with Australia at 460/7 with a lead of 595 runs. The tourists had added 51 runs {{for the loss of}} three wickets in approximately an hour's batting after lunch. Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers, with two each. The Australians had punished the spinners the most, <b>taking</b> <b>more</b> than 3.50 runs per over from each of Wright, Laker and Compton. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match.|$|E
5|$|Albert of Habsburg (who was Sigismund of Luxembourg's {{son-in-law}} and successor) wrote {{a letter}} to Vlad, ordering him to protect Transylvania. Ignoring the king's command, Vlad joined Murad II who came to Wallachia at the head of his army in summer 1438, serving the sultan as his guide. The Ottoman and Wallachian troops broke into Hungary at Orșova. They routed the army of a local Vlach kenez, Cândea, near Hațeg. They marched along the river Mureș, capturing Câlnic and Sebeș. At Sebeș, Vlad convinced the leaders of the town to give in without resistance, promising to protect their property if they accompanied him to Wallachia. The Ottomans and Wallachians laid siege to Sibiu, but the siege lasted only for 8 days. They destroyed the outskirts of Brașov, before they left Hungary loaded with plunder and <b>taking</b> <b>more</b> than 30,000 captives.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{fell for}} a duck, and Morris and Bradman rebuilt the innings, slowly taking the score to 87 before Bradman was caught {{for the third}} {{consecutive}} time by Hutton in the leg trap off Bedser. In the meantime, Morris, after a slow start, made 105 runs {{out of a total of}} 166 scored while he was at the wicket, including 14 fours and one six. His innings was noted for powerful, well-placed cover drives. His dismissal left Australia at 166/3, quickly followed by Miller, left Australia at 173/4. Hassett and Brown rebuilt the innings slowly, <b>taking</b> <b>more</b> than three and half minutes on average for each run. Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley removed him and Brown in the space of nine runs to leave Australia 225/6. Johnson fell soon after and England were well placed when Australia ended the day on 258/7.|$|E
5|$|During the 2001–02 WNCL, Ebsary {{played in}} all eight matches, {{and was given}} more responsibility. This season, she batted in seven innings and bowled 51 of a maximum {{possible}} 80 overs. In the first match of the season, she took 3/29 from 10 overs against the titleholders New South Wales, and she scored 51 in the fifth match against Victoria. Ebsary {{did not have a}} significant impact in the other matches, never <b>taking</b> <b>more</b> than one wicket per match or reaching double figures with the bat. She ended the season with 67 runs at 9.57 and six wickets at 30.83 at an economy rate of 3.62. South Australia won four of their eight matches and did not make the final.|$|E
5|$|He started {{strongly}} with match figures of 7/87 in a drawn match against Queensland in Brisbane.

He performed steadily for the next six matches, not <b>taking</b> <b>more</b> than two wickets in any innings, before playing a prominent role in the final match of the Sheffield Shield season against Victoria. It was then 100th anniversary of matches between the old rivals. Davidson took 6/99 in the first innings, including Harvey for 128, before adding 2/61 in the second. It helped prevent a defeat on the anniversary and sealed New South Wales' hat-trick of Shield titles.|$|E
