5|$|In Thio Li-ann's view, {{it appears}} that the High Court allowed the matter to be decided {{according}} to the subjective discretion of the Minister. The only explanation given for deregistration was that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service was contrary to the public interest. The Court did not require the executive <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> exactly how a failure to perform national service would be contrary to public interest. It accepted the executive's discretion to derogate a fundamental right without a close scrutiny of the executive's rationale and explanations.|$|E
5|$|Congress held {{hearings}} on the two bills {{in the summer of}} 1986. Admiral William J. Crowe Jr., Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, led the Pentagon's opposition to the bills. He proposed, as an alternative, a new Special Operations Forces command led by a three-star general. This proposal was not well received on Capitol Hill—Congress wanted a four-star general in charge to give SOF more clout. A number of retired military officers and others testified in favor of the need for reform. By most accounts, retired Army Major General Richard Scholtes gave the most compelling reasons for change. Scholtes, who commanded the joint special operations task force in Grenada, explained how conventional force leaders misused SOF during the operation, not allowing them to use their unique capabilities, which resulted in high SOF casualties. After his formal testimony, Scholtes met privately with a small number of Senators <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> the problems that he had encountered in Grenada.|$|E

5|$|Three {{aspects of}} {{communication}} patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, tangential and circumstantial speech, and marked verbosity. Although inflection and intonation {{may be less}} rigid or monotonic than in classic autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky or loud. Speech may {{convey a sense of}} incoherence; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide context for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to detect whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|New Multitudes is one {{of several}} tribute albums for American folk singer-songwriter Woody Guthrie. Guthrie died in 1967 after an {{extended}} battle with Huntington's disease, but his abbreviated career helped to inspire innumerable musicians during his lifetime {{as well as in the}} 1960s folk revival movement. Initially, this project was announced as a Farrar solo album with Johnson as a contributor. It was intended to follow previous efforts <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> the archives of the Foundation by Billy Bragg and Wilco with the albums Mermaid Avenue (1998) and Mermaid Avenue Vol. II (2000), Blackfire's Woody Guthrie Singles (2003), Jonatha Brooke's The Works (2008), and the various artists compilation Note of Hope: A Celebration of Woody Guthrie (2011). Farrar was initially invited to collaborate with Bragg on the Mermaid Avenue sessions in 1995, but felt uncomfortable working on the material with someone else. Warner Bros. Records wanted all of Son Volt to collaborate with Bragg, but after Farrar declined, he kept the idea in mind. In 2006, he approached Nora Guthrie about returning to her father's lyrics and she agreed.|$|E

25|$|Only anecdotal {{reports of}} {{displaced}} fractures set by internal fixation predate Joseph Lister's 1865 introduction of antiseptic surgery, whereupon Lister reported silver wire on a displaced petellar fracture. Even before radiography, Lane found that conventional setting by manipulation and splints yielded poor outcomes—bone disunion and joint changes or wear in individuals under much physical activity—and Lane started with wires and screws in 1892. The conservative medical community was vehemently opposed, so revolutionary was Lane's approach that organizations certifying surgeons sometimes automatically dismissed students able <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> such procedures, as nearly 50% of patients whose closed fractures were opened died by ensuing infections. Yet with aseptic surgical techniques previously unheard of, Lane forged ahead.|$|E
25|$|Engels' {{ideas on}} the role of {{property}} {{in the creation of the}} modern family and as such modern civilization begin to become more transparent in the latter part of Chapter 2 as he begins <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> the question of the monogamous relationship and the freedom to enter into (or refuse) such a relationship. Bourgeois law dictates the rules for relationships and inheritances. As such, two partners, even when their marriage is not arranged, will always have the preservation of inheritance in mind and as such will never be entirely free to choose their partner. Engels argues that a relationship based on property rights and forced monogamy will only lead to the proliferation of immorality and prostitution.|$|E

25|$|Guinevere {{has been}} portrayed as {{everything}} from a weak and opportunistic traitor to a fatally flawed but noble and virtuous gentlewoman. In Chrétien de Troyes's Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, she is praised for her intelligence, friendliness, and gentility, while in Marie de France's Lanval (and Thomas Chestre's Middle English version, Sir Launfal), she is a vindictive adulteress, disliked by the protagonist and all well-bred knights. Early chronicles tend to portray her inauspiciously or hardly at all, while later authors use her good and bad qualities to construct a deeper character who played a larger role. The works of Chrétien {{were some of the}} first <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> the character Guinevere beyond simply the wife of Arthur. This was likely due to Chrétien's audience at the time, the court of Marie of France, Countess of Champagne, which was composed of courtly ladies who played highly social roles.|$|E
25|$|Foreign (non-US citizen) {{students}} applying {{from another}} country form a large and growing percentage of applicants (including accepted applicants) to American universities. According to Andover counseling director Sean Logan, applications to American universities from foreign students have increased dramatically in the past decade. International applications are typically similar to domestic ones but with additional complications. Most international applicants do not receive a GPA score or transcript from their school. Most will not normally take SAT or ACT exams, so these must be arranged. Most American universities are happy to accept international and foreign qualifications such as the International Baccalaureate or IB, or British A Levels, although it is often up to the applicant <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> the meaning of these qualifications. Non-native English speakers {{may be asked to}} provide English language qualifications. If a university requires or offers an interview, these can normally be conducted over the phone or with alumni residing in the applicant's country, according to Uni in the USA, a guide book catering to the growing number of British students seeking to study in the United States. International applicants often must cope with higher tuition fees and less available financial aid, although this varies significantly by college. Further, international applicants also have to apply for a student visa, which can be a complex and time-consuming process.|$|E

500|$|On appeal, the Court of Appeal in Shadrake v. Attorney-General (2011) {{held that}} the {{apparent}} difference between the inherent tendency test and the real risk test was a [...] "legal red herring". However, since the inherent tendency test had caused confusion, it affirmed the High Court's ruling that the real risk test was the applicable test for scandalizing the court. It felt that trying <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> {{the meaning of a}} [...] "real risk" [...] was not helpful, and that the court should simply ask itself whether, [...] "having regard to the facts as well as surrounding context, a 'real risk' that public confidence in the administration of justice is – or would be – undermined {{as a result of the}} impugned statement?" ...|$|E
500|$|The Punk Goes Acoustic {{version of}} [...] "Swing Life Away" [...] {{attracted}} little attention from fans, and McIlrath {{believed that the}} song had [...] "died out".

[...] McIlrath decided <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> the song, and used one of Sheryl Crow's guitars he found in the studio to add an instrumental bridge. This version of the song was included in Siren Song of the Counter Culture.|$|E

In response, Wilkinson said that Jones should [...] "be involved in improving the process, not be so negative about everything" [...] and [...] "pay attention to his own business". A Lexington Herald-Leader story noted that a promised news conference <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> Jones' role in the administration had not yet happened and that [...] "ost observers expect it never will".

40|$|Providing {{support for}} {{adaptive}} solutions that allow systems {{to change their}} behavior at runtime {{has the potential to}} improve functionality and performance in a variety of contexts. This paper argues that the true value of this approach can be realized only by addressing the issues needed to provide a general solution. These include supporting adaptations that span multiple hosts and multiple system components, and algorithmic adaptations that involve changing the underlying algorithms used by the system at runtime. In addition <b>to</b> <b>elaborating</b> <b>on</b> these issues, an overall software architecture that includes an adaptation controller and graceful adaptation protocol is described. The architecture is being implemented using Cactus, a system for constructing highly-configurable distributed services and protocols. ...|$|R

500|$|According to Staten, Tor Books asked Bungie if {{they had}} someone suited to writing the next novel; Staten, having written much of the Halo series canon, was the obvious choice. The author found that the book was the perfect way <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> the Halo story without {{stripping}} it down for a video game: [...] "I always felt we shortchanged [...] We don't {{have a lot of}} time to tell story while the bullets are flying." [...] In addition, Staten said that the novel was the perfect way to do the character of Sergeant Johnson—who had appeared somewhat one-dimensional in the games—proper justice as a well-rounded character. Replying to G4TV's question about writing action, Staten replied that he felt that writing [...] "involves slowing things down", in comparison to a game of Halo. The author also said that the work of his favorite science-fiction authors helped teach him the importance of honing a [...] "strong, consistent voice".|$|E
500|$|Though {{previous}} Halo novels {{had been}} written by professional writers like Eric Nylund and William C.

The novel is an ensemble piece, with the action being narrated from both human and alien viewpoints; the work of Staten's favorite science-fiction authors helped teach him the importance of honing a [...] "strong, consistent voice". Staten found that writing compelling action involved slowing things down, paradoxically {{the opposite of the}} fast-paced gameplay of a Halo title. He considered the book the perfect way <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> the Halo story without stripping it down for a video game, and flesh out the character of Avery Johnson more than the games had allowed.|$|E
500|$|While making Metroid Prime Hunters, a Metroid first-person shooter {{video game}} for the Nintendo DS, Nintendo {{producer}} Kensuke Tanabe {{came up with the}} idea to make a pinball game based on the Metroid series as Fuse Games finished Mario Pinball Land, another pinball simulator based on a Nintendo property. Tanabe felt like the Metroid universe fit into such a setting due to series protagonist Samus being able to morph into a ball, and Fuse agreed that the license was [...] "a great fit for pinball", accepting to work on the game. Fuse Games then received some assets from Metroid Prime developers Retro Studios, and collaborated with the Hunters team at Nintendo Software Technology <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> specific aspects of Metroid Prime Pinball, such as Samus's wall climbing and shooting abilities.
