5|$|In 1890, the Sherman Silver Purchase Act greatly {{increased}} government purchases of silver. The government pledged <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> the silver dollars and treasury notes issued under the act by redeeming them in gold. Pursuant to this promise, government gold reserves dwindled {{over the following}} three years. Although the economic Panic of 1893 {{had a number of}} causes, President Grover Cleveland believed the inflation caused by Sherman's act to be a major factor, and called a special session of Congress to repeal it. Congress did so, but the debates showed bitter divides in both major parties between silver and gold factions. Cleveland tried to replenish the Treasury through issuance of bonds which could only be purchased with gold, with little effect but to increase the public debt, as the gold continued to be withdrawn in redemption for paper and silver currency. Many in the public saw the bonds as benefiting bankers, not the nation. The bankers' feeling was that they did not want loans repaid in an inflated currency—the gold standard was deflationary, and as creditors, they preferred to be paid in such a currency, whereas debtors preferred to repay in inflated currency.|$|E

He {{selected}} ten people who he said had clearly visible auras. They were <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> screens and he claimed that their auras would be visible above the screens, which were numbered 1 through 10, and the subjects were told by the astrologer behind which screen to stand. He was to tell whether or not a person was standing behind each screen, by seeing their aura above. Since random guessing would be expected to get about five correct, the psychic needed to get eight of the ten right. The psychic stated that he saw an aura over all ten screens, but people were behind only four of the screens.|$|E
25|$|The Pittsburg Pirates {{moved to}} Exposition Park the {{following}} season. On April 24, 1891, Fred Carroll hit the first home {{run by a}} Pirate in the stadium. Under the management of Fred Clarke the Pirates won the National League pennant in 1901, 1902, and 1903. After the 1903 season, Dreyfuss and Boston Americans owner Henry Killilea organized a best of nine game series to match the two pennant winners against each other. The first World Series held three games in Boston before moving to Exposition Park with the Pirates leading the series 2–1. On October 6, 1903, 7,600people attended the first World Series game in a National League stadium—the Pirates won by one run. The following day 12,000people attended the game, forcing some spectators <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> a rope in the outfield.

He states that Marlo expects his people <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> him, yet he himself does not stand behind people who work for him. He tells McNulty that the game is rigged and that he feels like a pawn on a chessboard, showing that some of D'Angelo Barksdale's teachings were not lost on him. He offers McNulty information to bring down Marlo, but openly tells McNulty that he will not give any information on any former Barksdale associate.

25|$|To {{understand}} drum protocol, a drum may {{be thought}} of as a person or being and is to be regarded and respected as such. Drum etiquette is highly important. There are regional variations. The drum is the central symbol of Oklahoma pow wows and is located in the center of the dance floor and pow wow (which are themselves shaped in concentric circles). Southern drums are suspended by four posts, one for each direction. Northern drums are set up on the outside of the dance area, with the host drum in the best position. Drummer-singers are expected to remain at their drum and ready to sing at any moment's notice; a dancer might approach the drum and whistle, fan or gesture his staff over a drum to indicate his request for a song even if it is not that drum group's turn to sing. In some regions it is considered disrespectful to leave a drum completely unattended. Some drum groups do not allow females to sit down at their drum but welcome them <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> the drummers and sing backup harmonies; the reasons for this point vaguely to a variety of tribal stories that attempt to tell the history of drumming as each group understands it. People bring water to the drummers and generally assist the players as needed. (It is also considered a taboo among some nations to discuss spiritual teachings in writing or to name absolute authority in reference to spiritual teachings.) The drum is offered gifts of tobacco during giveaways and musicians acknowledge this by standing.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the speech}} was little noticed, and McGovern backed away from saying {{anything}} publicly {{for over a year}} afterward, partly because of the November 1963 assassination of President Kennedy and partly to not appear strident. Though more skeptical about it than most senators, McGovern voted in favor of the August 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, {{which turned out to be}} an essentially unbounded authorization for President Lyndon B. Johnson to escalate U.S. involvement in the war. McGovern thought the commander-in-chief should be given limited authority to retaliate against an attack; subsequently he said his instinct had been to vote no, but that he had voted yes based on Senator J. William Fulbright's urging <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> Johnson politically. Indeed, the day after the resolution vote, McGovern spoke concerning his fears that the vote would lead to greater involvement in the war; Wayne Morse, one of only two senators to oppose the resolution, sardonically noted that this fell into the category of [...] "very interesting, but very belated". This would become the vote that McGovern most bitterly regretted.|$|E
500|$|In 1919, Elliott became Melbourne's city solicitor. His {{involvement}} with returned servicemen's issues {{led to his}} redrafting of {{the constitution of the}} [...] Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia.

Many men came specifically for Elliott, ready <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> him again, although he was forced to leave only a few days into the Strike to attend meetings in Queensland of the Royal Commission on the Navigation Act. He received special thanks from the premier of Victoria, Harry Lawson.

500|$|Two Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, Patricia Hussey and Barbara Ferraro (no {{relation}} to Geraldine Ferraro), did not recant from their pro-choice positions. [...] Hussey and Ferraro, {{directors of the}} Covenant House in Charleston, West Virginia—a shelter for homeless and abused women and children—were supported by CFFC in their dispute with the Church. [...] By March 1986, Hussey and Ferraro were no longer calling for [...] "dialogue" [...] but were publicly demanding recognition of [...] "a woman's right to choose." [...] In July 1986 when the two nuns were pressured more strongly with expulsion, 11 of the other nuns who signed came forward with a statement in solidarity with them, denying a recent Vatican announcement that all nuns but Hussey and Ferraro were now aligned with the Church's position on abortion. The eleven complained of the Church's divisive tactics, which they said were intended to isolate Hussey and Ferraro. Signer Maureen Fiedler said, [...] "I have never retracted or recanted one syllable of the Catholic Statement on Abortion and Pluralism.

[...] After nearly four years of dispute, Hussey and Ferraro were informed by their order's leadership in June 1988 {{that they would not}} be dismissed from the order.

C. T. U. In Dover, a committee of women was appointed, meetings held and saloons visited. Burlingame was a member of this committee, presided at the great mass meetings held, and was offered the leadership of the movement, which she declined. “In June, 1873,” said Burlingame, “Mrs. M. M. H. Hills came to my house and told me I had been elected president of the Free Baptist W.M.S., just organized at the New Hampshire Yearly Meeting. I at once decided that if president in name, I would be in fact. It had been the custom for women's societies in the denomination to ask a minister to preside, read reports and conduct all public business. I arranged at the first meeting after my election for the women to do their own work. I well remember the first time I presided at the Anniversaries in 1873 at Farmington, N. H."

2500|$|There are {{two types}} of stance-direction used by snowboarders. A [...] "regular" [...] stance places the rider's left foot {{at the front of the}} snowboard. [...] "Goofy", the {{opposite}} stance direction, places the rider's right foot at the front, as in skateboarding. Regular is the most common. There are different ways to determine whether a rider is [...] "regular" [...] or [...] "goofy". One method used for first time riders is to observe the first step forward when walking or climbing up stairs. The first foot forward would be the foot set up at the front of the snowboard. Another method used for first time riders is to use the same foot that you kick a football with as your back foot (though this can be an inaccurate sign for some, as there are people who prefer goofy though are right handed, and therefore naturally kick a football with their right foot). This is a good method for setting up the snowboard stance for a new snowboarder. However having a surfing or skateboarding background will also help a person determine their preferred stance, although not all riders will have the same stance skateboarding and snowboarding. Another way to determine a rider's stance is to get the rider to run and slide on a tiled or wooden floor, wearing only socks, and observe which foot the person puts forward during the slide. This simulates the motion of riding a snowboard and exposes that persons natural tendency to put a particular foot forward. Another method is <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> the first-timer and give them a shove, enough for them to put one foot forward to stop themselves from falling. Other good ways of determining which way you ride are rushing a door (leading shoulder equals leading foot) or going into a defensive boxing stance (see which foot goes forward).|$|E
2500|$|There was a brawl on pit road {{involving}} Jeff Gordon, Brad Keselowski and Kevin Harvick. Keselowski and Harvick {{were parked}} in the post-race impound area where the cars that finished second through sixth are held for post-race inspection. Gordon pulled his car and parked it right beside Brad's car. He got out and had a level-headed conversation with {{the driver of the}} No. 2 Ford that seemed to make him more angry. As Keselowski was putting on his Miller Lite cap, Kevin proceeded to shove him towards Gordon and all hell broke loose. Multiple pit crews from the three racing stables as well as Paul Menard's crew were involved (Keselowski's spot in the impound area was in the pit stall of the No. 27 car). ESPN's Jamie Little was {{caught in the middle of}} it. “We’re racing for the win,” said Keselowski of the on track contact. “ to wreck him, just racing hard. He left a hole and you know, everything you watch in racing, you leave a hole, you’re supposed to go for it. It closed back up and we made contact. I don’t want to ruin anyone’s day. I want to win the race and that was our opportunity. Just didn’t come together.” “I spun the tires a little bit but I got a pretty decent start and we went down into one and I just wanted to get to the outside of the 48 [...] and out of nowhere, I got slammed by the 2 and it cut my left rear tire. He's just a dipshit," [...] Gordon said in a nationally televised interview on ESPN. [...] "I don't know how he's ever won a championship. I'm just sick and tired of him. ...

(Keselowski) gets himself in this position himself and as far as I'm concerned he's got to pay the consequences. … It's total crap. The kid is just doing stuff way over his head." [...] “I'm not trying to sit here and sugarcoat it and try to be The Intimidator,’’ Keselowski said. “That's not what I'm trying to say. My expectation is if there's a gap, they'll go for it. If there's a gap, I'll go for it. If it closes up, there's contact, then that's racing. And that's what happened today. Will those guys race me hard or harder than others? Absolutely, I'm certain they will. But that's just part of it. I can't fault them for that. I just feel like I have to go for the gap if it's there, and I have to race the way I race or I won't even be in NASCAR. I'd rather have enemies in NASCAR than have friends and be sitting at home.’’ “If you’re going to drive like that, you better be willing to fight,’’ Harvick said he told Keselowski. “He was going <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> his guys. Jeff Gordon deserved to at least have a face-to-face conversation with him. I wasn’t standing up for anybody. (Keselowski) just ran over (Gordon). He was standing back behind all his guys, not wanting to defend what he did. I said, ‘You’re the problem, get in your own fight.’ ‘’ Robin Pemberton, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said that series officials will review what took place to determine what, if any, penalties will be issued. “Holding onto each other and grabbing… that's one thing.
