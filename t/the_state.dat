5|$|After the {{elections}} {{in the fall of}} 1862, Governor Morton feared that the legislature's Democratic majority would attempt to hinder the war effort, reduce his authority, and vote to secede from the Union. After the legislative session convened in 1863, all but four Republican legislators stayed away from Indianapolis to prevent the general assembly from attaining the quorum it needed to pass legislation, including funding <b>the</b> <b>state</b> government or making tax provisions. This rapidly led to a crisis as <b>the</b> <b>state</b> government began to run out of money to conduct its business and was nearly bankrupt. Going beyond his constitutional powers, Morton solicited millions of dollars in federal and private loans to avert the crisis. To obtain funds to run <b>the</b> <b>state</b> government, Morton turned to James Lanier, a wealthy banker from Madison, Indiana. On two occasions, Lanier provided <b>the</b> <b>state</b> with more than $1 million (USD) in unsecured loans. Morton's move was successful, he was able to fund <b>the</b> <b>state</b> government and the war effort in Indiana. There was little the legislature could do but watch.|$|E
