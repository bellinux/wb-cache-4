40|$|Although insect {{size and}} {{robustness}} often have been hypoth-esized to be factors {{that lead to}} taphonomic bias in the insect fossil record, no studies have examined how these factors di-rectly affect an insect's preservation potential. In this study, laboratory experiments were performed on modern Coleop-tera (beetles) to examine the importance of insect morphology on preservation potential. A rotary <b>tumbling</b> <b>barrel</b> {{was used to determine}} how insect size and robustness would in¯uence sinking and disarticulation rates. Although size and robust-ness were not correlated directly, beetles that were larger and more robust were more resistant to disarticulation than smaller, less-robust beetles. Waterlogged specimens gained increased ¯exibility in their exoskeletons, and were dif®cult to puncture. Sinking and disarticulation rates were correlat-ed, although it took fewer days for beetles to sink than it took to begin disarticulating. A white-colored ®lm was apparent on all specimens within a few days of their introduction to the tumbling barrel; however, major disarticulation did not occur until the specimens sank to the bottom. An examina-tion of the fossil-beetle literature also suggests the impor-tance of hardness in preservation potential. Although often considered fragile, given the right physical characteristics and environmental conditions, insects can be resistant to disarticulation and decay...|$|E

60|$|All this {{looked very}} serious; and I {{began to think}} a third raft was to founder under me. After a short {{consultation}} it was determined to lighten the ship.

We then knocked away the wash-boards {{in the wake of}} the two hatches, and began to <b>tumble</b> the <b>barrels</b> of turpentine on deck. I never felt so strong in my life, nor did so much work in so short a time. During the labour I went below to splice the main-brace, and, after putting a second-mate's nip of brandy into my glass, filled it, as I supposed, with water, drinking it all down without stopping to breathe. It turned out that my water was high-proof gin; yet this draught had no more effect on me than if it had been so much cold water. In ordinary times, it would have made me roaring drunk.|$|R

40|$|Brewer, Paul, Lewin, J., (2002) 'Laboratory {{simulation}} of clast abrasion', Earth Surface Processes and Landforms 27 pp. 145 - 164 RAE 2008 Experimental abrasion of river-bed materials {{has been widely}} undertaken, producing downstream fining rates that generally {{are believed to be}} much less than those observed in the field. A conclusion commonly adopted has been that sorting processes are more effective than abrasion processes. A comparative evaluation of results from an abrasion tank and a <b>tumbling</b> <b>barrel</b> are presented, which show that abrasion patterns and rates differ according to the equipment used, clast size and shape, the clast charge (barrel) and water velocity and bed material (tank). Abrasion is a composite process, and the effects achieved appear to be dominated by percussion in the tank and grinding in the barrel. Breakage, crushing and sandblasting are not modelled effectively, nor are effects achieved on clasts when they form part of the bed. Comparisons are made with other equipment used, the very limited amount of direct field abrasion monitoring, and with the probable suite of processes that may occur under field conditions. Also reviewed are the problems that arise when laboratory weight-loss abrasion coefficients are used or converted into ones of size diminution, as usually derived from field observations of down-channel trends. It is concluded that field abrasion rates generally have been underestimated, as the processes involved are at best only selectively represented by the experimental equipment so far used, and because the results obtained experimentally are capable of misinterpretation when related to field trends.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} how Unio bivalve shells fragment within the channel of the Sakmara River (southern Urals, Russia). The Sakmara River has an abundant bivalve population and a highly variable flow regime which, at low flow, allowed much of the channel bed to be examined. A large data set of 1013 shells (Unio sp.) was examined and these were shown to have consistent patterns of orientation, aspect, shell abrasion, perforation and fracture. The close spatial relationship between areas of shell abrasion, shell perforation and shell fracture showed that they form part of a continuum whereby areas of abrasion evolve into perforations and perforations coalesce and enlarge into fractures. The mechanism of shell damage proposed is one of abrasion in place, whereby the shell remains stationary on the surface of the point bar and is impacted by bedload. Underpinning this process are the hydrodynamic properties of the bivalve shell, with consistency in the orientation and aspect of the valve in a flowing current producing consistency in the distribution of damage on the shell surface. Valves preferentially lie in a convex-up position and orientate in the flow such that the umbo faces upstream. The elevated, upstream-facing umbo region is exposed to particle impact and is the first to be abraded and perforated. The vulnerability of the umbo to perforation is greatly increased by the thinness of the shell at the umbo cavity. The in situ abrasion process is enhanced by the development of an armoured gravel bed which restricts valve mobility and maintains shells within the abrasion zone at the sediment-water interface. The in situ abrasion process shows that broken shells are not a reliable indicator of long distance transport. The study also raises the issue that <b>tumbling</b> <b>barrel</b> experiments, which are generally used to simulate shell abrasion, will not replicate the type of directionally focused sand-blasting which appears to be the principal cause of shell fragmentation in the Sakmara River. ...|$|E
60|$|At first I {{had great}} {{difficulty}} in believing in my good luck; but the trap fell, and the profound {{stillness of the}} place satisfied me that I had avoided that danger, at least. This escape was so singular and unexpected, that I could hardly believe in its reality; though real it was, to all intents and purposes. The absurd often strikes the imagination in an absurd way; and so it proved {{with me on this}} occasion. I sat down on a tub and laughed heartily, when I felt absolutely certain all was right, holding my sides lest the sound of my voice might yet betray me. Lowiny was similarly infected, for I heard peals of girlish laughter from her, as her brothers <b>tumbled</b> about <b>barrels,</b> and tubs, and bedsteads, in {{the upper part of the}} building, in their fruitless and hurried search. This merriment did not pass unrebuked, however; Prudence lending her daughter a box on the side of the head, that, in one sense, reached even my ears; though it probably aided in saving the girl from the suspicion of being in my secret, by the very natural character of her girlish indulgence. Two or three minutes after the trap closed on me for the second time, the sounds of footsteps and voices overhead ceased, and the hut seemed deserted.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Currently, {{there are}} several methods for {{indicating}} wear of the steel ball and screw shaft components of CNC machining centres. These include wear prediction of the steel ball and screw shaft of the ball screw by using the value of backlash. This value, generally, has to be determined using expensive equipment such as a laser interferometer or a ball bar. In {{order to reduce the}} monitoring cost of ball screw wear, especially steel ball wear, a new monitoring technique is introduced. This technique was developed from a correlation between steel ball wear and the surface roughness of the machined surface of a test piece. In this research, the balls were subjected to artificial wear which were achieved by using a <b>barrel</b> <b>tumbling</b> process. Experimental results indicated that ball wear causes increase in surface roughness of a machined test piece. Employing these results, an equation for estimating steel ball wear was developed. Research results also showed that this new technique can reduce monitoring cost significantly compared with the cost of conventional methods...|$|R
60|$|Maybe {{the boys}} {{nowadays}} do not throw fire-balls, or know about them. They {{were made of}} cotton rags wound tight and sewed, and then soaked in turpentine. When a ball was lighted a boy caught it quickly up, and threw it, and it made a splendid streaming blaze through the air, and a thrilling whir as it flew. A boy {{had to be very}} nimble not to get burned, and a great many boys dropped the ball for every boy that threw it. I am not ready to say why these fire-balls did not set the Boy's Town on fire, and burn it down, but I know they never did. There was no law against them, and the boys were never disturbed in throwing them, any more than they were in building bonfires; and this shows, as much as anything, what a glorious town that was for boys. The way they used to build their bonfires was to set one tar-barrel on top of another, as high as the biggest boy could reach, and then drop a match into them; in a moment a dusky, smoky flame would burst from the top, and fly there like a crimson flag, while all the boys leaped and danced round it, and hurrahed for the Whig candidates. Sometimes they would <b>tumble</b> the blazing <b>barrels</b> over, and roll them up and down the street.|$|R
6000|$|... "Finally, by his directions, they flung me {{into the}} big rocking-chair. I was sewed in so tight that I was stiff {{like a piece of}} wood. He was giving orders in a very loud voice, and that man Babalatchi saw that they were executed. They obeyed him implicitly. Meantime I lay there in the chair like a log, and that woman capered before me and made faces; snapped her fingers before my nose. Women are bad!--ain't they? I never saw her before, as far as I know. Never done {{anything}} to her. Yet she was perfectly fiendish. Can you understand it? Now and then she would leave me alone to hang round his neck for awhile, and then she would return before my chair and begin her exercises again. He looked on, indulgent. The perspiration ran down my face, got into my eyes--my arms were sewn in. I was blinded half the time; at times I could see better. She drags him before my chair. 'I am like white women,' she says, her arms round his neck. You should have seen the faces of the fellows in the verandah! They were scandalized and ashamed of themselves to see her behaviour. Suddenly she asks him, alluding to me: 'When are you going to kill him?' Imagine how I felt. I must have swooned; I don't remember exactly. I fancy there was a row; he was angry. When I got my wits again he was sitting close to me, and she was gone. I understood he sent her to my wife, who was hiding in the back room and never came out during this affair. Willems says to me--I fancy I can hear his voice, hoarse and dull--he says to me: 'Not a hair of your head shall be touched.' I made no sound. Then he goes on: 'Please remark that the flag you have hoisted--which, by the by, is not yours--has been respected. Tell Captain Lingard so when you do see him. But,' he says, 'you first fired at the crowd.' 'You are a liar, you blackguard!' I shouted. He winced, I am sure. It hurt him to see I was not frightened. 'Anyways,' he says, 'a shot had been fired out of your compound and a man was hit. Still, all your property shall be respected on account of the Union Jack. Moreover, I have no quarrel with Captain Lingard, who is the senior partner in this business. As to you,' he continued, 'you will not forget this day--not if you live to be a hundred years old--or I don't know your nature. You will keep the bitter taste of this humiliation to the last day of your life, and so your kindness to me shall be repaid. I shall remove all the powder you have. This coast is under the protection of the Netherlands, and you have no right to have any powder. There are the Governor's Orders in Council to that effect, and you know it. Tell me where the key of the small storehouse is?' I said not a word, and he waited a little, then rose, saying: 'It's your own fault if there is any damage done.' He ordered Babalatchi to have the lock of the office-room forced, and went in--rummaged amongst my drawers--could not find the key. Then that woman Aissa asked my wife, and she gave them the key. After awhile they <b>tumbled</b> every <b>barrel</b> into the river. Eighty-three hundredweight! He superintended himself, and saw every barrel roll into the water. There were mutterings. Babalatchi was angry and tried to expostulate, but he gave him a good shaking. I must say he was perfectly fearless with those fellows. Then he came back to the verandah, sat down by me again, and says: 'We found your man Ali with your little daughter hiding in the bushes up the river. We brought them in. They are perfectly safe, of course. Let me congratulate you, Almayer, upon the cleverness of your child. She recognized me at once, and cried [...] "pig" [...] as naturally as you would yourself. Circumstances alter feelings. You should have seen how frightened your man Ali was. Clapped his hands over her mouth. I think you spoil her, Almayer. But I am not angry. Really, you look so ridiculous in this chair that I can't feel angry.' I made a frantic effort to burst out of my hammock to get at that scoundrel's throat, but I only fell off and upset the chair over myself. He laughed and said only: 'I leave you half of your revolver cartridges and take half myself; they will fit mine. We are both white men, and should back each other up. I may want them.' I shouted at him from under the chair: 'You are a thief,' but he never looked, and went away, one hand round that woman's waist, the other on Babalatchi's shoulder, to whom he was talking--laying down the law about something or other. In less than five minutes there was nobody inside our fences. After awhile Ali came to look for me and cut me free. I haven't seen Willems since--nor anybody else for that matter. I have been left alone. I offered sixty dollars to the man who had been wounded, which were accepted. They released Jim-Eng the next day, when the flag had been hauled down. He sent six cases of opium to me for safe keeping but has not left his house. I think he is safe enough now. Everything is very quiet." ...|$|R
