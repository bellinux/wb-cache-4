5|$|Beginning in 2003, PEARL {{deemed the}} {{operation}} self-sufficient and reduced {{financial support for}} the Abahuzamugambi Cooperative. The cooperative provided its growers with loans that helped improve living standards and allowed for livestock investments, affordable medical insurance, and education. A cooperative bank was opened in the village in March, enabling farmers <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>and</b> manage their own funds locally, {{rather than having to}} trek the long distance to Butare.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{are popular}} birds in aviculture, but their needs are {{difficult}} to meet. The cockatiel is the easiest cockatoo species <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>and</b> {{is by far the}} most frequently kept in captivity. White cockatoos are more commonly found in captivity than black cockatoos. Illegal trade in wild-caught birds contributes to the decline of some cockatoo species in the wild.|$|E

5|$|The T-26 was {{exported}} {{and used}} extensively by Spain, China and Turkey. Captured T-26s {{were used by}} the Finnish, German, Romanian and Hungarian armies. The tank was reliable and simple <b>to</b> <b>maintain,</b> <b>and</b> its design was continually modernised between 1931 and 1941. No new models of the T-26 were developed after 1940.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the century, {{the many}} repairs {{undertaken}} since the memorial's construction had left a patchwork of materials and colours, and a disconcerting pattern of damage from water intrusion at the joints. In May 2001, the Government of Canada announced the Canadian Battlefield Memorials Restoration Project, a major C$30million restoration project to restore Canada's memorial sites in France and Belgium, in order <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>and</b> present them in a respectful and dignified manner. In 2005, the Vimy memorial closed for major restoration work. Veterans Affairs Canada directed the restoration of the memorial in cooperation with other Canadian departments, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, consultants and specialists in military history.|$|E

The rapid growth of Gatwick Airport provided opportunities for businesses in the aviation, transport, warehousing and distribution industries.

5|$|In April 1888, the Church Board of Education {{was created}} {{as part of}} the LDS Church, {{inspired}} by a proposal made by Maeser in 1887. Maeser was made a member of the board, and was later appointed the superintendent of the Church Educational System. The Board of Education was created <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>and</b> supervise church schools. This position later became the Commissioner of Church Education. As Superintendent, Maeser helped establish initial policies for new academies established by the church. He also helped train teachers, and gave suggestions on the architecture of new school designs. By 1889, Maeser oversaw 19 schools that operated under the academy system. In 1889, Church Board of Education established a board of examiners to certify teachers. The board awarded Maeser a Doctor of Letters and Didactics degree that same year. Maeser also continued writing in the Juvenile Instructor in the 1890s to clarify church educational policies.|$|E
5|$|In August 2013, Vice-Admiral Shekhar Sinha, {{chief of}} the Western Naval Command, said the Ministry of Defence would scrap the ship as she had become very {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>and</b> no private bidders had offered to fund the museum's operations. On 3 December 2013, the Indian government decided to auction the ship. The Bombay High Court dismissed a public-interest lawsuit filed by Kiran Paigankar to stop the auction, stating the vessel's dilapidated condition did not warrant her preservation, nor were the necessary funds or government support available.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to a fire station, the building housed a police station, an ambulance station, a bank, a coroner's court, and a gas-meter testing station. The fire station operated for eighty years, housing the firemen, their families, and the horse-drawn appliances that were replaced by motorised vehicles {{a few years after}} its opening. It was visited by royalty in 1942, in recognition of the brigade's wartime efforts. After the war it became a training centre and in 1952 became the first centre equipped to record emergency calls. However, the fire station became expensive <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>and</b> after council reorganisation decline set in.|$|E
5|$|Maintaining the castles proved challenging, {{and they}} rapidly fell into disrepair. The money {{given to the}} castle constables to enable them <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>and</b> {{garrison}} the castles had not been generous to start with, but the sums provided declined considerably during the 14th century. The constable of Conwy Castle had been provided with £190 a year in 1284, but this fell away to £40 a year by the 1390s; Harlech's funding fell similarly from £100 a year to only £20 by 1391. By 1321 a survey reported that Conwy was poorly equipped, with limited stores and suffering from leaking roofs and rotten timbers, and in the 1330s, Edward III was advised {{that none of the}} castles were in fit state to host the royal court should he visit the region. A 1343 survey showed that Beaumaris needed extensive work, with several of the towers in a ruinous conditions.|$|E
5|$|Maintenance problems. The chain driven {{valve gear}} {{proved to be}} {{expensive}} <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>and</b> subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels caused oil to splash onto the boiler lagging in service. Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash which provided a combustible material, {{and as a result}} of the heavy braking of the locomotives, sparks would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing. The fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators onto the wheels when stationary to be flung upwards into the boiler lagging in service. In either case, the local fire brigade would invariably be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming into contact with the hot boiler, causing stress to the casing. Many photographs show an unmodified with 'buckled' (warped) casing, the result of a lagging fire.|$|E

He supported the United Nations in its early years, an unpopular position in Dallas for that time. In the early 1950s he began to explore the ramifications of ending the store's participation in the then-common practice of excluding black customers from shopping in the store, and while his legal advisors cautioned against that step, he offered support for any black entrepreneur looking to establish a quality store and, in 1954, began to hire black staff in some departments.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants {{engage in}} ritualised fights <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>and</b> resolve {{boundary}} disputes with neighbouring colonies. When individuals from separate colonies meet, they will engage {{each other until}} appeasement occurs. A meat ant detects a foreign worker by intense antennation and gaping of the mandibles, and will also stretch themselves upward to appear taller and larger, suggesting that meat ants {{do this in a}} display of size matching. Once the ants have finished fighting, they will groom themselves and search for another ant. Such disputes between colonies may continue for months or even years in the same area, and escalated fights that result in serious injury or death are rare.|$|E
