The City and County of San Francisco is also implementing a citywide health care program for all uninsured residents, limited to those whose incomes and net worth are below an eligibility threshold.

500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s {{a group of}} newly observant members began holding more {{traditional}} services in a back room of the synagogue, complete with a mechitza, a partition separating men and women. The [...] "more feminist-minded" [...] members strongly objected to having a mechitza anywhere in the Temple Beth Israel building, {{even if it were}} not in <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>they</b> attended. The latter group eventually circulated a petition which stated that either the mechitza would have to be taken down, or those members who wanted it would have to leave. Kinberg also signed the petition. Faced with this opposition, in 1992 the Orthodox members left, renting new premises and hiring their own rabbi, creating Eugene's second synagogue, originally called [...] "The Halachic Minyan", and in 1998 renamed [...] "Congregation Ahavas Torah".|$|E
500|$|The Jesuit {{order was}} {{successful}} in penetrating China and serving at the Imperial court. They impressed the Chinese with their knowledge of European astronomy and mechanics, and in fact ran the Imperial Observatory. The Kangxi Emperor was at first friendly to the Jesuit Missionaries working in China. Their accurate methods allowed him to successfully predict eclipses, one of his ritual duties. He was grateful for <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>they</b> provided to him, {{in the areas of}} astronomy, diplomacy and artillery manufacture. [...] Jesuit translators Jean-François Gerbillon and Thomas Pereira took part in the negotiations of the Treaty of Nerchinsk in 1689, where they assisted with translation. The Jesuits made an important contribution to the Empire's military, with the diffusion of European artillery technology, and they directed the castings of cannons of various calibres. The Kangxi Emperor also retained several Jesuits in his court as scientists and artists. By the end of the seventeenth century, the Jesuits had made many converts. They in turn were impressed by the knowledge and intelligence of the Han Chinese Confucian scholar elite, and adapted to their ancient Chinese intellectual lifestyle.|$|E
30|$|When {{immigrant}} customers {{undertake a}} dental treatment {{in their native}} country (e.g. less-developed one), they may initially be uncertain and not confident that <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>they</b> receive is of good quality [52]. This is especially the case of dental tourism in less-developed countries, where low price {{is one of the}} main reasons for customers to use this service. In this circumstance, a high-quality interaction between a dentist and a customer would facilitate the social exchange and mutual understanding, leading to the development of trust in customers [53]. In turn, when customers trust in the dentist and his <b>service,</b> <b>they</b> are more confident that <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>they</b> receive is worth the money, leading to better price value.|$|R

5000|$|A customer's {{expectation}} {{of a particular}} service is determined by factors such as recommendations, personal needs and past experiences. <b>The</b> expected <b>service</b> and <b>the</b> perceived <b>service</b> sometimes may not be equal, thus leaving a gap. <b>The</b> <b>service</b> quality model or the ‘GAP model’ developed in 1985, highlights the main requirements for delivering high service quality.

Customers generally {{have a tendency to}} compare <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>they</b> 'experience' with <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>they</b> 'expect' [...] If the experience does not match the expectation, there arises a gap. Ten determinants that may influence the appearance of a gap were described by Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry. in the SERVQUAL model: reliability, responsiveness, competence, access, courtesy, communication, credibility, security, understanding the customer and tangibles.|$|R
