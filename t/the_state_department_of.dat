Cooper supported the governor's plan to provide free textbooks for the state's school children and sponsored legislation to prohibit judges from issuing injunctions to end labor strikes, although the latter bill did not pass.|$|E

5|$|An {{automobile}} {{bridge across}} Ebey Slough and the Snohomish River estuary to Everett {{was completed in}} 1927, with funding from <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>department</b> <b>of</b> highways to complete the Pacific Highway (later part of U.S. Route 99, and present-day State Route 529). The city remained relatively unchanged through the Great Depression, with the diversity of industries credited for Marysville avoiding the worst of economic hardship experienced by other nearby communities.

5|$|In July 2012, Governor Dannel Malloy {{announced}} that 5 weekend round trips would {{be extended to}} New London beginning in April 2013.

Two weekday midday trips were added in May 2013, while weekend service began on June 1, 2013, after the application for additional bridge closings was approved by <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> Energy and Environmental Protection.

5|$|The Burial Council's core {{contention}} is the city's decision {{to conduct an}} archaeological survey of the rail line's route in phases, meaning construction on {{a majority of the}} line will be complete by the time the survey in the Kakaako area is performed, which in turn increases the likelihood that any remains discovered will be moved instead of being allowed to remain in situ. In response to the Burial Council's concerns, the city agreed to begin conducting an archaeological survey of the area in 2010, two years earlier than originally planned. <b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> Land and Natural Resources later signed the city's programmatic agreement on January 15, 2011, over the continuing concerns of the Burial Council.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Hardy {{pushed the}} notion of {{granting}} the school college status. In 1921, the California legislature made the school a four-year teacher's school, which placed it under the management of <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> Education. On July 28, 1921, the San Diego Normal School became San Diego State Teachers College (usually shortened to San Diego State College or SDS). With this ranking, the college could now grant certificates and degrees. Prior to the school's conversion, it had graduated 1,500 teachers, educated many of the San Diego children at its training school, and helped to expand the economic and cultural development of the city. Also in 1921, the legislature moved San Diego Junior College, that {{was a part of}} San Diego High School, to the college campus due to crowding issues. Administrators moved the junior college believing it would only overlap the same material taught at the teacher's school. The junior college remained with the school until 1947, when it became independent.|$|E

5|$|Governor Mike Easley {{declared}} a state of emergency in advance of the storm, and 200National Guard troops were dispatched to Charlotte, Raleigh, Kinston and Lumerton, while 800more were on standby. On Ocracoke Island, authorities ordered mandatory evacuations, while on Bogue Banks voluntary evacuations were in place. Officials in Wrightsville Beach drove along the streets with loudspeakers mounted on trucks, warning tourists that a storm was approaching. The storm forced the University of North Carolina at Wilmington to suspend a planned opening for students moving into residence halls. Campgrounds at the Cape Hatteras National Seashore were closed by the National Park Service and three boat ramps were closed. Duke Power Co. prepared for Charley by lowering the level of hydroelectric lakes to make room for excessive rainfall. <b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> Environment and Natural Resources advised hog farmers to pump out their waste lagoon. About 60 Red Cross shelters were opened during the storm and during the peak of Charley, and roughly 1,600people sought protection.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Collins won the Democratic {{nomination}} for Clerk of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in a five-way primary. In the general election, she defeated Republican Joseph E.

During her term, an amendment to the state constitution changed the name of the Court of Appeals to the Kentucky Supreme Court; Collins was the last person to hold the office of Clerk of the Court of Appeals and the first to hold the office of Clerk of the Supreme Court. As Clerk, she compiled and distributed a brochure about the new role of the Supreme Court, and worked with <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>department</b> <b>of</b> education to create a teacher's manual for use in the public schools, detailing the changes effected in the court system {{as a result of the}} constitutional amendment.

5|$|The {{opening of}} Interstate 5 and the Tacoma Mall in 1965 caused a {{reduction}} in the number of retailers in Downtown Tacoma, which was only accessible via local streets from the freeway. The lost business, combined with worsening congestion in Downtown Tacoma, prompted downtown retailers to ask the state government for an improved connection to Interstate 5. <b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> Highways began studying a freeway connection between the Pacific Avenue Interchange (where SR 7 terminates) and Downtown Tacoma in 1955, recommending a temporary one-way couplet that became part of SR 509 and an eventual freeway link. In 1968, the Department of Highways adopted the routing of a freeway into Downtown Tacoma along the western side of the City Waterway, to be constructed over railroad right of way. The project, then part of a new freeway corridor for State Route 509 through the Port of Tacoma, was approved by the Tacoma City Council in 1971, but further planning was suspended at the time due to funding issues.|$|E

5|$|A factory was {{established}} {{soon after the}} fort was constructed and it minted coins that bore the initials TB or DB, indicating Dansborg. The fort acted as the important gateway in the trade route from Europe to Coramandel. Protestant missionaries were sent from Denmark by king Fredric IV, who was also the head of Lutheran Church of Denmark. Two of them, namely, Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg and Heinrich Plutschua came to Tranquebar on 9 July 1706, established the Tranquebar Mission, learnt Tamil {{in a few years}} and were the first to translate and print The New Testament of the Bible in Tamil in the printing press inside the fort. The Danish mission was the first Protestant mission in India and from its inception, was staffed by German missionaries trained at Pietist schools and seminary founded by Francke at the end of 17th century. A Tamil-Latin dictionary containing 9000 words was compiled there by a medical missionary named Friedrich Koenig in 1778, whose source letters are stored in the royal archives. The fort is featured in a large number of videos, films and commercials. After India's independence in 1947, the fort was used as an inspection bungalow by the state government till 1978 when <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> Archaeology of the Government of Tamil Nadu took over the control of the fort.
