50|$|The {{aircraft}} carriage {{is built}} from metal tubing. The flight controls are a foot pedal <b>throttle,</b> with <b>handles</b> for the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw. The {{main landing gear}} incorporates spring rod suspension.|$|R
50|$|The SL-250 has a 250 watt DC motor {{that can}} propel {{it up to}} 14 mph. It stands 40 inches tall, 40 inches long, and 12 inches wide. It holds two 24/7ah (UL, CE) {{batteries}} in series. The batteries last 10-15.5 miles on a 5-hour charge. It rides on Rubber Pneumatic tires (8"). It features a head light, turn signals, horn, key switch, volt meter, variable speed <b>throttle,</b> folding <b>handle</b> bars. It costs around $550.00-$650.00.|$|R
50|$|The player {{had to go}} as fast as {{possible}} without skidding off the road or colliding with other racing bikes on the screen. Turn the handlebars, and the bike would corner and bank. Twist the <b>handle</b> <b>throttle</b> open, and it would accelerate. When a collision with another bike occurs, the handlebars vibrate and the screen flashes a reverse image. To increase the challenge, the size of the bike can be regulated by the operator.|$|R
50|$|The <b>throttle</b> <b>handle</b> is on {{the right}} lever. In the closed {{position}} it completely shuts the fuel regulator valve, stopping fuel from reaching the engine. Turning the handle counterclockwise, the pilot increases the engine thrust. During servicing of the pack with compressed nitrogen the handle is held in the closed position with a shear pin for safety. The pilot's timer {{is on the}} same handle. Since the pack has fuel for only for 21 seconds of flight, it is critical to know when the pack will run out of fuel, so that the pilot can safely land before his tanks are empty.|$|E

5000|$|Starting in 1970 a turbo-normalized {{variant of}} the PA-24-260 was {{available}} with a Lycoming IO-540-R1A5 engine and dual Rayjay turbochargers. Advertised by Piper as a [...] "second throttle", the turbochargers are controlled using a manual wastegate assembly that places an additional handle labeled [...] "boost" [...] next to the <b>throttle</b> <b>handle</b> in the cockpit, effectively creating a secondary throttle. Twently-six [...] "TC" [...] models were produced between 1970 and 1972. The TC model is certified for flight to 25,000 feet, with an advertised turbo critical altitude of 20,000 feet, giving a maximum true airspeed of 223 mph (202 kt).|$|E
5000|$|Powered pallet jacks, {{also known}} as {{electric}} pallet trucks, walkies, single or double pallet jacks, or power jack, are motorized to allow lifting and moving of heavier and stacked pallets. Some contain a platform for the user to stand while moving pallets. The powered pallet jack is generally moved by a <b>throttle</b> on the <b>handle</b> to move forward or in reverse and steered by swinging the handle in the intended direction. Some contain a type of dead man's switch rather than a brake to stop the machine should the user need to stop quickly or leave the machine while it is in use. Others use a system known as [...] "plugging" [...] where in the driver turns the throttle from forward to reverse (or vice versa) to slow and stop the machine, as the dead man's switch is used in emergencies only.|$|R
2500|$|The 60hp Schneider {{gasoline}} engine and its radiator {{are located in}} the front part of the tank, to the immediate left of the driver. The four cylinder, 135×170 9753 cc, engine is of a type specially constructed for the Schneider CA. It attains its maximum output of sixty horsepower at a thousand rpm. The three forward speeds gearbox, as well as the differentials, which can be engaged by brakes on the half shafts to steer the tank, are all located on the rear axle. They are linked to the engine in the front by a driveshaft and a primary clutch. A secondary clutch is coupled to each sprocket and can be decoupled for a tight turn. The main clutch and the main brakes can be engaged by pedals, the <b>throttle</b> by a <b>handle.</b> By means of a reverse device the three gears can also be applied to drive backwards. Steering was generally very tiring and there was a tendency to jump out of gear when the clutch was engaged too forcefully. The tank's official top speed is only 8.1km/h. Practical terrain speed was even lower at two to four km/h. The first gear at 1000 rpm equals a speed of 2km/h, the second of 3.95km/h, the third of 6.75km/h. At two kilometres per hour the vehicle can climb a slope of 55%. The capacity to overcome obstacles, limited to a parapet of about eighty centimetres, is improved by two short climbing tails, fitted to the left and right of the lower hull rear. The lower profile of the tails is curved, allowing the vehicle to gradually raise itself above a trench floor, until its centre of gravity shifts over the edge causing its hull to suddenly tumble forward. [...] The trench-crossing capacity is about 175 centimetres. The wading capacity is eighty centimetres. Two fuel gravity-feed reservoirs placed above the engine below the right front roof and nose plate, have a total capacity of 145 litres, and allow for a practical range of about fifty kilometres, though the official range is eighty kilometres. The suspension consists of seven double road wheels attached to two bogies, the one in front carrying three, the other four. The rear bogie is sprung by two vertical coil springs, the front one larger than the rear one. [...] The front bogies of the left and the right, each sprung by a vertical coil of narrow diameter, are connected to each other by means of a yoke-like transverse beam, itself attached to the hull bottom by two wide vertical coils springs, diminishing rolling and tilt when crossing rough terrain. Ground clearance is forty-one centimetres. There are five small return rollers. The six-spoked idler is attached to the front bogie and can thus move vertically to some degree. The sprocket, having twenty teeth, is however fixed in relation to the hull. It has a somewhat larger diameter than the idler, causing the upper track profile to slope slightly downwards to the front. The track consists of thirty-three flat links with a width of thirty-six centimetres. The ground pressure is about 0.75kg/cm².|$|R
5000|$|Another unusual {{feature is}} the slanted {{overhang}} of the frontal part of the chassis which has {{the form of a}} pointed nose, ending in a high obliquely protruding steel spur. It had been designed for cutting through and crushing down German barbed wire, thus opening passages for following French infantry, originally seen as the primary function of the system. This long overhang could cause the tank to ditch itself readily. The major dimensions of the tank are a length of 6.32 m, a width of 2.05 m and a height of 2.3 m. The design is of the early so-called [...] "box tank" [...] type, in which the crew, propulsion system and all manner of equipment are not clearly separated. As a result, there is no real fighting compartment. The room available to the crew, illuminated by three small electric lights, is entered through a double door {{in the back of the}} tank and is extremely cramped. The crew consisted of a commanding officer who was also the driver; an NCO who was the gunner, two machine gunners, a loader who assisted both the cannon and the machine guns and a mechanic who doubled as a machine gun loader. Four of these six men had, at their assigned position, to crouch inside a 1.5 m high space between the roof and the tank's floor. They then had to stand within two narrow troughs, one, behind the driver's seat, used by the gunner and a second square one more to the back, between the suspension elements, used by the cannon loader and the two machine gunners. Most of the space however, had a height of just three feet between the roof and the covering of transmission and suspension: if the mechanic wanted to assist the right machine gun, he had to lie on his belly to load it. Part of each Schneider tank team were also three embedded riflemen who functioned as a sort of outside crew, during battle directly accompanying the vehicle. All-around protection was provided by 11.4 mm steel plate, later improved by a spaced armour of 5.4/5.5 mm, raising the weight from 12.5 to 13.5 tonnes. The roof had 5.5 mm armour. The plates are partly riveted; the superstructure is largely bolted.The 60 hp Schneider gasoline engine and its radiator are located in the front part of the tank, to the immediate left of the driver.

The ground pressure is about 0.75 kg/cm².As the traverse of the main gun was limited, it had first to be pointed in the general direction of the target by the driver-commander swivelling the entire vehicle. To facilitate this, a small rectangular frame is fitted on the right side of the nose of the tank. Looking through it, the driver had a sightline parallel to that of the cannon in a neutral position. In practice, the commander had a too limited view of his surroundings through the small hatches to his left, front and right and had to resort to lifting his head out of his rectangular top hatch to observe the enemy. Small rectangular hatches, fitted with a vision slit, are further present to the front of each machine-gun. The main ventilation is provided by a large skylight slit running along the midline of the hull. It is doubly roofed with the lower roof having a second slit in its top, while the higher roof has open lower sides, creating oblique oblong ventilation channels through which fresh air can be sucked in from the outside. The top roof is the highest element of the vehicle. With later production vehicles, polluted air is removed through a broad ventilation grid in the nose, having a recessed armour plate below it. To the left and the right of the skylight roof rectangular escape hatches are present in the hull top.The vehicles were delivered by the factory painted in the standard grey colour used by the Artillery Arm and other branches of the army and that was often called [...] "artillery grey". It was a rather light pearl grey shade. At first, by the Section Camouflage in the field a specially designed complex striped flame pattern was added consisting of narrow vertical red brown, dark green and yellow ochre patches, delineated in black. This was intended to break the contours of the vehicles. To some observers, it made them seem strikingly colourful. The original grey paint was perhaps only partly covered, including it in the ensemble; an alternative interpretation of the lightest patches seen in black-and-white photographs is that it represents a light green hue. Later, when the appliqué armour was added a much simpler scheme was used where the same hues were shown in large irregular areas, again demarcated in black. In the first combat actions, it became clear that German machine gunners concentrated their fire on the vision slits. To confuse them, in the summer of 1917 a cross-hatched scheme of narrow vertical and horizontal dark grey stripes was applied on top of the original patches. The stripes continued over the side machine gun ball mounts but a round area remained untouched to suggest a false position. The individual Schneider CA tanks had serial numbers ranging from 61001 to 61399. The first tactical markings consisted of simple numbers, to distinguish the individual tanks within a training unit. Early 1917 the combat units used small inconspicuous playing-card symbols, each symbol indicating one of four batteries within a groupe. These were sprayed in white on the tank side, often combined with an individual tank number, depending on the style each groupe preferred. The tank number could also be indicated on the tank spur, by horizontal stripes.|$|R
50|$|A {{rocket motor}} with a thrust of 280 pounds-force (1.25 kN or 127 kgf) was chosen. The pack with its fuel weighed 125 lb (57 kg). The pack had a {{fiberglass}} frame contoured {{to fit the}} operator's body, secured with straps, and cylinders of fuel and nitrogen were attached to the frame. The motor was fastened using a hinged assembly that was controlled by levers under the shoulders while thrust was controlled through a regulator assembly connected to a <b>throttle</b> <b>handle</b> on the right lever of the device. The handle on the left lever governed the slant of the (jetavators) nozzles. Tests of the pack began {{toward the end of}} 1960 and were performed in a large hangar with a safety tether. Wendell Moore completed the first 20 tethered takeoffs while making incremental improvements.|$|E
30|$|The PISa (Powered two wheeler Integrated Safety) project {{focused on}} the {{development}} and implementation of integrated safety systems for PTWs. The main outcomes were the development of Active Braking (AB) and Distance Support (DS) functions. The former performs an autonomous braking actions whenever an unavoidable collision is identified and no rider action is detected, to reduce impact speed and thus accident consequences. DS function supports the rider during normal riding conditions providing information on the safe distance from the leading vehicle. The HMI strategy used tactile interaction in both case although different information had to be provided: for AB function the rider received a warning, limited in time, about the oncoming braking action of the system. The tactile interaction was chosen as it allowed the rider to receive information without moving his/her sight from the road ahead (this aspect is particularly relevant when riders have to deal with an unavoidable accident). The HMI device associated with AB was a vibrating saddle activated to warn the rider before of the braking action, while for DS Support was developed a Haptic Throttle able to provide a torque feedback on the <b>throttle</b> <b>handle.</b> The Haptic Saddle consisted of a set of independent vibrating elements integrated in the saddle foam, and properly positioned to provide a tactile perception. The Haptic Throttle provided a torque feedback on the <b>throttle</b> <b>handle</b> to suggest a safe distance to the vehicle ahead. The system was designed to leave the full control to the rider since the torque can be overridden in case the rider decides to overtake the leading vehicle instead of following [12].|$|E
40|$|A piloted {{simulation}} {{study was}} conducted comparing three different input methods for interfacing to a large screen, multiwindow, whole flight deck display for management of transport aircraft systems. The thumball concept utilized a miniature trackball embedded in a conventional side arm controller. The multifunction control throttle and stick (MCTAS) concept employed a thumb switch located in the <b>throttle</b> <b>handle.</b> The touch screen concept provided data entry through a capacitive touch screen installed on the display surface. The objective and subjective results obtained indicate that, with present implementations, the thumball concept was the most appropriate for interfacing with aircraft systems/subsystems presented on a large screen display. Not unexpectedly, the completion time differences between the three concepts varied with the task being performed, although the thumball implementation consistently outperformed the other two concepts. However, pilot suggestions for improved implementations of the MCTAS and touch screen concepts could reduce some of these differences...|$|E
