5|$|Aristocrates, who was {{commanding}} a regiment of hoplites in Piraeus, {{arrested the}} extremist general Alexicles; enraged, the extremist {{leaders of the}} 400 demanded action, and {{made a number of}} threats against Theramenes and his party. To their surprise, Theramenes volunteered to lead a force to rescue Alexicles; the leaders of the extremists acquiesced, and Theramenes set out to Piraeus, sharing his command with one other moderate and one extremist, Aristarchus. When Theramenes and his force arrived at Piraeus, Aristarchus, in a rage, exhorted the men to attack the hoplites who had seized Alexicles. Theramenes feigned rage as well, but when asked by the hoplites whether he thought that the fortification on Eetioneia was a good idea, he responded that if they wanted to pull it down, he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> good. Calling out that everyone who wanted the 5,000 to govern instead of the 400, the hoplites set to work. Donald Kagan has suggested that this call was probably instigated by Theramenes' party, who wanted the 5,000 to govern; the hoplites tearing down the fortification might well have preferred a return to the democracy. Several days later, the Peloponnesian fleet approached Piraeus, but, finding the fortifications destroyed and the port well defended, they sailed on to Euboea. Several days later, the 400 were formally deposed and replaced by a government of the 5,000; the most extreme of the oligarchs fled the city.|$|E

25|$|Everett {{has also}} {{recently}} reinterpreted even the limited form of embedding {{in the example}} above as parataxis. He now states that Pirahã does not admit any embedding at all, not even one level deep. He says that words that appear to form a clause in the example are actually a separate unembedded sentence, which, in context, expresses the same <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> expressed by a clause in English. He gives evidence for this based {{on the lack of}} specialized words for clause-formation, the pattern of coreferring tokens in the purported clause-constructions, and examples where the purported clause is separated {{from the rest of the}} sentence by other complete sentences.|$|E

25|$|In a low-scoring thriller at The County Ground, Derby, Dominic Cork had the {{pleasure}} of beating his old county, though it became a tougher task than expected, considering that Derbyshire had not won a Championship match since 2004. Winning the toss and batting, Derbyshire had a good opening partnership between Australian Michael Di Venuto and Ben France, but Greg Chapple put the pressure on with some patient, economical bowling and reaped the rewards with three wickets for 29. However, it was Cork who got the most wickets, after taking the last three of the innings to finish with four for 40 and send Derbyshire off for 191. Lancashire lost two quick wickets in reply, and were in trouble when Warren Hegg departed at 128 for 6, but a fine innings worth 64 from Cork down the order - along with 24 from Muttiah Muralitharan - sent Lancashire into a 50-run lead. Muralitharan was, indeed, in contention for Man of the Match, bowling 27 overs in succession and taking six for 50 as Derbyshire collapsed to 185, setting a target of 136 to win. Lancashire <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a walk in the park, especially as Iain Sutcliffe and Mal Loye paired up for 53 for the second wicket, but they then lost seven men for sub-12 scores and were in trouble at 131 for 9. Only Sutcliffe kept his head calm, carrying his bat to 62 not out, and he and Muralitharan managed to add the required five runs.|$|E

Because he's done that, and it’s not working out for him, it’s driving him crazy. So we really wanted to show that he’s a tragic figure much more than a villainous figure. It’s just a series of unfortunate {{situations}} that have led to him slowly losing himself in this world. Popping back in time and showing his concern for Rick and how he cares for Lori and Carl, I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a good thing to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Naming {{the train}} was a task that was very seriously taken by Budd. [...] He wanted a name that started with the letter Z because this train was {{intended}} to be the [...] "last word" [...] in passenger service; Budd and his coworkers looked up the last words in their dictionaries, but neither zymurgy nor zyzzle conveyed the meanings that Budd was looking for. [...] The name of the new train came from The Canterbury Tales, which Budd had been reading. The story begins with pilgrims setting out on a journey, inspired by the budding springtime and by Zephyrus, the gentle and nurturing west wind. Budd <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> an excellent name for a sleek new traveling machine—Zephyr.|$|E

500|$|During the game's planning, it {{was decided}} that it should not be {{directly}} connected to Shin Megami Tensei, ensuring that it would hold interest independent from the first game; because of this, Kaneko envisioned it as a story loosely based on Shin Megami Tenseis future. At first, he imagined it to take place ten years after the first game, as he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> roughly the amount of time needed for society to rebuild, but another staff member wanted it to take place hundreds of years later. Kaneko disagreed, saying that culture would have changed a lot over a hundred years, and that he could not even imagine what the world would look like a hundred years into the future or what it had been like during the Meiji period. The two had different ideas about the timeline of the series, but eventually decided to set the game [...] "several decades" [...] after Shin Megami Tensei. They made use of the tree of life as a central theme of the story.|$|E
500|$|While {{developing}} the game, most of NST's efforts {{were focused on}} its multiplayer aspect because of its first-person shooter gameplay, and {{to take advantage of}} the Wi-Fi and voice chat capabilities of the Nintendo DS. One of the game's designers, Richard Vorodi, noted that [...] "the hardware kinda dictated [...]" [...] Wanting to introduce a new element to the Metroid series, Abe created several new bounty hunters after he realized that the game's multiplayer mode and the new bounty hunters could both be implemented seamlessly into the game: [...] "We had this idea early on and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a good way to introduce [...] and [...] to the gameplay and take advantage of that in the multiplayer." [...] Metroid Prime Hunters includes several references to previous games in the Metroid Prime series. Samus' ship is from the original Metroid Prime, and her suit is the same one that appears in Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. The developers decided to add them because they wanted to show that the technology has evolved, and they also wanted to include something that was instantly recognizable to those who had played previous games in the series. On level design, Abe said that as the game's controls shifted from an analog stick method to touchscreen aiming, the developers wanted to avoid making the gameplay and the control scheme more difficult.|$|E

I also didn't want {{to stand up and say}} 'Hi, my name's Stephen, I'm an actor in a sitcom.' These are places where people are trying to work out really difficult stuff. We do touch on some controversial subjects in the series; there's a lad with Down syndrome in one episode. There's all sorts of topics that you wouldn't initially think are comic issues." ...|$|E

2500|$|Crisler {{served as}} Michigan's head {{football}} coach from 1938 to 1947. [...] When he took over as head coach at Michigan in 1938, Crisler introduced the distinctive winged football helmet which has since {{become one of the}} symbols of Michigan Wolverines athletics programs. [...] Crisler developed a similar winged helmet pattern in 1935 while coaching at Princeton. [...] At Michigan, he added to the innovation by painting the helmets maize and blue, thus highlighting the winged pattern. [...] Crisler created the distinctive design to help his halfbacks find receivers downfield. Crisler later recalled, [...] "There was a tendency to use different colored helmets just for receivers in those days, but I always <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> as helpful for the defense as for the offense." ...|$|E
2500|$|Persuaded by his publishers, {{he started}} [...] "a new Hobbit" [...] in December 1937. After several false starts, {{the story of}} the One Ring emerged. The idea for the first chapter ("A Long-Expected Party") arrived fully formed, {{although}} the reasons behind Bilbo's disappearance, the significance of the Ring, and the title The Lord of the Rings did not arrive until the spring of 1938. Originally, he planned to write a story in which Bilbo had used up all his treasure and was looking for another adventure to gain more; however, he remembered the Ring and its powers and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a better focus for the new work. As the story progressed, he also brought in elements from 'The Silmarillion' mythology.|$|E

On a whim, she suggested a show about a mother and daughter but had put little thought into the idea. Having to create a pilot, she drew inspiration for the show's setting of [...] "Stars Hollow, Connecticut" [...] after making a trip to Washington Depot, Connecticut, where she stayed at the Mayflower Inn. She explained: [...] "If I can make people feel this much of what I felt walking around this fairy town, I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> wonderful ... At the time I was there, it was beautiful, it was magical, and it was feeling of warmth and small-town camaraderie ...

2500|$|Jackman {{was born}} in Sydney, New South Wales, to Grace McNeil (née Greenwood) and Christopher John Jackman, a Cambridge-trained accountant. His parents were English and had come to Australia in 1967 {{as part of the}} [...] "Ten Pound Poms" [...] immigration. One of his {{paternal}} great-grandfathers, Nicholas Isidor Bellas, was Greek, from the Ottoman Empire (now in Greece). His parents were devout Christians, having been converted by Evangelist Billy Graham after their marriage. Jackman has four older siblings and was the second of his parents' children to be born in Australia. He also has a younger half-sister, from his mother's remarriage. His parents divorced when he was eight, and Jackman remained in Australia with his father and Jackman's two brothers, while his mother moved back to England with Jackman's two sisters. As a child, Jackman liked the outdoors, {{spending a lot of time}} at the beach and on camping trips and school holidays all over Australia. He wanted to see the world: [...] "I used to spend nights looking at atlases. I decided I wanted to be a chef on a plane.
