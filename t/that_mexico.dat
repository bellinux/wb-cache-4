5|$|In boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling, two bronze medals {{were awarded}} in each weight class. In baseball, {{atypical}} rainfall {{during the games}} forced the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Pan American Games to rearrange the schedule, and the competition for the bronze medal never took place. Mexico had to leave on the previously assigned date without playing for the third position. Therefore, the technical delegate ruled <b>that</b> <b>Mexico</b> and Nicaragua were each to be awarded a bronze medal.|$|E
5|$|Events {{leading up}} to the 1842 Battle of Salado Creek caused Houston to believe <b>that</b> <b>Mexico</b> was {{planning}} a full-scale invasion to re-take Texas. In response, he moved the Republic's capital farther east to Washington-on-the-Brazos, and sent Margaret back to her relatives in Alabama. Upon her later return, they temporarily lived with the Lockhart family at Washington-on-the-Brazos until they were able to acquire a small home there. The couple's first child Sam Houston Jr. was born in the new house on May 25, 1843. Upon learning of her son Martin's death in a duel, Nancy moved in with the Houstons, helping Margaret with the new baby, and over Houston's objections, pitching in with some financial assistance for food and household necessities.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} Calhoun's arrival in Washington, D.C., Tyler {{attempted}} to quickly finalize the treaty negotiations. Sam Houston, President of the Texas Republic, fearing Mexican retaliation, {{insisted on a}} tangible demonstration of U.S. commitments {{to the security of}} Texas. When key Texas diplomats failed to appear on schedule, the delay compelled Tyler to bring his new Secretary of State directly into negotiations. Secretary Calhoun was directed to honor former Secretary Upshur's verbal assurances of protection now offered by Calhoun in writing, to provide for U.S. military intervention in the event <b>that</b> <b>Mexico</b> used force to hold Texas. Tyler deployed U.S. Navy vessels to the Gulf of Mexico and ordered army units mobilized, entirely paid for with $100,000 of executive branch contingency funds. The move side-stepped constitutional requirements that Congress authorize appropriations for war.|$|E

There is also a visible community of people of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, representing 4.2% of Saint Paul's population. By the 1980s, the Thomas Dale area, once an Austro-Hungarian enclave known as Frogtown (German: Froschburg), became home to Vietnamese people who left their war-torn country. Soon after a settlement program for the Hmong diaspora came, and by 2000, the Saint Paul Hmong were the largest urban contingent in the United States.

25|$|The current {{national}} flag was adopted on September 16, 1968, and {{was confirmed by}} law on February 24, 1984. The current version is an adaptation of the design approved by presidential decree in 1916 by Venustiano Carranza, where the eagle was changed from a front-facing to a side-facing position. Before {{the adoption of the}} current {{national flag}}, official flags have been used by the government. All of these flags used the tricolor pattern, with the only differences being the changes in the coat of arms, which was still charged {{in the center of the}} white stripe. One possible reason for the 1968 flag and arms change was <b>that</b> <b>Mexico</b> City was the host of the 1968 Summer Olympic Games. Around this same time period, the plain tricolor flag <b>that</b> <b>Mexico</b> used as its merchant ensign was also legally abandoned. The reasoning is that without the coat of arms, the flag would not be the Mexican flag; it would become nearly identical to the Italian flag.|$|E

25|$|As president, one of Obregón's top {{priorities}} was securing US diplomatic {{recognition of his}} regime, to resume normal Mexico–United States relations. Although he rejected the U.S. demand <b>that</b> <b>Mexico</b> rescind Article 27 of the constitution, Obregón negotiated a major agreement with the United States, the Bucareli Treaty of August 1923 that made some concessions to the US {{in order to gain}} diplomatic recognition. It was particularly helpful when the Mexican Supreme Court, in a case brought by Texas Oil, declared that Article 27 did not apply retroactively. Another important arena in which Obregón resolved issues with the U.S. and other foreign governments was the Mexican-United States General Claims Commission. Finance Minister Adolfo de la Huerta signed a deal in which Mexico recognized a debt of $1.451million to international bankers. Finally, at the Bucareli Conference, Obregón agreed to an American demand <b>that</b> <b>Mexico</b> would not expropriate any foreign oil companies, and in exchange, the U.S. recognized his government. Many Mexicans criticized Obregón as a sellout (entreguista), including Adolfo de la Huerta for his actions at the Bucareli Conference.|$|E
