25|$|In the United States, a tiller truck, {{also known}} as a <b>tractor-drawn</b> aerial, tiller ladder, or hook-and-ladder truck, is a {{specialized}} turntable ladder mounted on a semi-trailer truck. Unlike a commercial semi, the trailer and tractor are permanently combined and special tools are required to separate them. It has two drivers, with separate steering wheels for front and rear wheels.|$|E
25|$|Yields of pure wheat {{per unit}} area {{increased}} as methods of crop rotation were applied to long cultivated land, {{and the use of}} fertilizers became widespread. Improved agricultural husbandry has more recently included threshing machines and reaping machines (the 'combine harvester'), <b>tractor-drawn</b> cultivators and planters, and better varieties (see Green Revolution and Norin 10 wheat). Great expansion of wheat production occurred as new arable land was farmed in the Americas and Australia in the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, {{the company}} {{acquired}} Gleaner Manufacturing Company, {{which was an}} important move for its combine harvester business. Allis was the market leader in pull-type (<b>tractor-drawn)</b> combines, with its All-Crop Harvester line. But acquiring Gleaner meant that it would now also be a leader in self-propelled machines, and it would own two of the leading brands in combines. The Gleaner line augmented (and later superseded) the All-Crop Harvester line, and for several years Gleaner's profits made up nearly all of Allis-Chalmers' profit. Gleaners continued to be manufactured at the same factory, in Independence, Missouri, after the acquisition.|$|E

His ballplayers included Dwight D. Eisenhower and Omar N. Bradley. On 1 April 1916, he was promoted to first lieutenant. That August he was transferred to the newly activated 9th Field Artillery at Schofield Barracks, in what was then the Territory of Hawaii. His only child, daughter Frances Lyon, was born there on 20 July 1917. The 9th Field Artillery had a battalion of 4.7-inch guns and one of 155mm guns. Medium artillery was new in the United States Army, and the 9th was its first artillery <b>tractor-drawn</b> regiment. Devers was given command of Battery F.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tractor-drawn</b> {{combines}} (also called pull-type combines) became common after World War II as many farms {{began to}} use tractors. An example was the All-Crop Harvester series. These combines used a shaker to separate the grain from the chaff and straw-walkers (grates with small teeth on an eccentric shaft) to eject the straw while retaining the grain. Early <b>tractor-drawn</b> combines were usually powered by a separate gasoline engine, while later models were PTO-powered. These machines either put the harvested crop into bags that were then loaded onto a wagon or truck, or had a small bin that stored the grain until it was transferred to a truck or wagon with an auger.|$|E

5000|$|After World War I all but ten of {{the wartime}} regiments were disbanded. The four regiments of the 30th Railway Artillery Brigade {{initially}} remained, along with six <b>tractor-drawn</b> regiments equipped with the 155 mm gun M1918 (6.1 inch), developed from the French Canon de 155mm GPF (Grand Puissance Filloux, or high-powered gun designed by Filloux), a weapon these regiments used during the war. This weapon, drawn by heavy Holt tractors, introduced road and cross-country mobility to the Coast Artillery, and allowed mobile defense of areas not protected by fixed harbor defenses. Circular concrete platforms called [...] "Panama mounts" [...] were added to existing defenses to improve the utility of these guns. Budget reductions resulted in the disbandment of all but three of the <b>tractor-drawn</b> regiments and all but one railway regiment by late 1921. The anti-aircraft mission continued with three battalions in CONUS, one battalion in the Philippines, and a regiment in Hawaii.|$|E
50|$|Forage {{harvesters}} {{collect and}} chop the plant material, and deposit it in trucks or wagons. These forage harvesters {{can be either}} <b>tractor-drawn</b> or self-propelled. Harvesters blow the chaff into the wagon through a chute at the rear or side of the machine. Chaff may also be emptied into a bagger, which puts the silage into a large plastic bag that is {{laid out on the}} ground.|$|E
50|$|Plastic mulch used in {{large-scale}} {{commercial production}} is laid {{down with a}} <b>tractor-drawn</b> or standalone layer of plastic mulch. This is usually part of a sophisticated mechanical process, where raised beds are formed, plastic is rolled out on top, and seedlings are transplanted through it. Drip irrigation is often required, with drip tape laid under the plastic, as plastic mulch is impermeable to water.|$|E
5000|$|It took {{twelve months}} for the 39th Division {{organization}} to reach France, where it remained for three months. [...] The 142nd Field Artillery Regiment sailed for France 31 August 1918 and arrived 7 September. After arrival in France, the 142nd drew equipment and began training on the <b>tractor-drawn</b> 155 mm howitzer. The 142nd was certified for combat 8 November 1918, and the Armistice was signed on the 11th, preventing the 142nd from participating in combat.|$|E
50|$|Early binders were horse-drawn and {{powered by}} a bull wheel. Later models were <b>tractor-drawn.</b> The {{implement}} had a reel and a sickle bar, like a modern grain head for a combine harvester, or combine. The cut stems would fall onto a canvas, which conveyed the crop to the binding mechanism. This mechanism bundled the stems of grain and tied a piece of twine around the bundle. Once tied, it was discharged {{from the back of}} the binder.|$|E
50|$|Raised beds lend {{themselves}} {{to the development of}} complex agriculture systems that utilize many of the principles and methods of permaculture. They can be used effectively to control erosion and recycle and conserve water and nutrients by building them along contour lines on slopes. This also makes more space available for intensive crop production. They can be created over large areas with the use of several commonly available <b>tractor-drawn</b> implements and efficiently maintained, planted and harvested using hand tools.|$|E

When the company turned 40 in 1959, local newspaper Tyrvään Sanomat wrote about the diversity of know-how in the company:”The company has expanded its range to include products such as <b>tractor-drawn</b> harrows and rollers. The range of woodworking tools has also been expanded and existing models improved, stone grinding machines have also been revamped and new types designed.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] Snow Roller [...] {{also applies}} to a horse-drawn {{implement}} used {{in the mid to}} late 19th century (though <b>tractor-drawn</b> examples are still in limited use today, mainly at ski resorts) to pack snow. It was mainly used in areas with high snow accumulation for access for horses and horse-drawn sleighs or wagons equipped with skis or runners. The implement was essentially, a large, very wide, wooden wheel, weighed down with stone or concrete.|$|E
50|$|In 1922, 274 Coast Artillery {{companies}} were authorized, 188 {{of which were}} active. During that year 44 {{companies were}} inactivated, but 14 new companies were created for the Philippine Scouts, and a 15th in 1923. The Philippine Scouts, units of mostly Filipino enlisted men and mostly US officers, manned many of the coast defenses in the Philippines and served in other key roles. The General Staff reconfirmed a commitment to artillery and mines as the most practical and cost-effective methods for seacoast defense, {{as an alternative to}} a larger Navy or Air Corps. In 1924 the CAC adopted a regimental system, consolidating the companies into 16 Regular Army harbor defense regiments, two Philippine Scouts harbor defense regiments, three Regular <b>tractor-drawn</b> regiments, and two Regular railway regiments. These were supplemented by 11 harbor defense and two <b>tractor-drawn</b> regiments of the National Guard, which trained in peacetime for activation in wartime. The total companies authorized remained the same, at 289 with 144 active. From 1930 to 1932 the army drafted new defense projects for each harbor. In 1931 it established a Harbor Defense Board to supervise the execution of these projects.|$|E
