5|$|Malaysia {{established}} {{diplomatic ties}} with North Vietnam on 31 March 1973 at the ambassadorial level after the Paris Peace Accords were signed that year. An {{agreement between the}} ambassadors of Malaysia and Vietnam was reached in 1975. The following year, Malaysia first opened its embassy in Hanoi, while Vietnam also opened its embassy in Kuala Lumpur on 29 May 1976. In {{the mid to late}} 1970s, bilateral ties were strained as Malaysia pressured Vietnam to embrace the ZOPFAN concept, which the latter interpreted as a version of the anti-communist containment policy. During a bilateral summit in August 1977, Malaysia's Prime Minister Hussein Onn made promises to provide economic and technical assistance to rebuild Vietnam's war-torn economy. When Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1979, many Vietnamese sought refuge in Malaysia from that time onwards and into the 1980s, and caused economic and national security problems to Malaysia especially to its racial balance as most the Vietnamese refugees resemble <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>people.</b> Bilateral ties normalised from 1988 onwards, when Vietnam announced plans to withdraw from Cambodia. In the early 1990s, government leaders of both countries held several diplomatic visits and summits, which produced many agreements that emphasised economic co-operation and development. Strengthening ties also saw the opening of a consulate office in Ho Chi Minh City in January 1991. Vietnam expressed its interest in joining ASEAN with Malaysia's support in 1994 as the countries continued to foster close economic ties. Vietnam joined ASEAN in 1995; its entry was warmly welcomed by Malaysia.|$|E

25|$|In the Western world, Guan Yu is {{sometimes}} called the Taoist God of War, probably because {{he is one of}} the most well-known military generals worshipped by <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>people.</b> This is a misconception of his role, as, unlike the Greco-Roman deity Mars or the Norse god Týr, Guan Yu, as a god, does not necessarily bless those who go to battle, but rather people who observe the code of brotherhood and righteousness.|$|E

He is also held in high esteem in Confucianism.

25|$|In this work, {{they were}} joined by Nicolas Joseph Delisle (1683–1745), a friend of Fréret, who gave a more {{cultural}} and geographical tone to their work and discussions. Deslisle's brother, Guillaume Delisle, was already a renowned geographer. Delisle encouraged Arcadio Huang to read Europe's best known and popular writings dealing with the Chinese Empire. Huang was surprised by the ethnocentric approach of these texts, reducing the merits of <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>people</b> and stressing the civilizing role of the European peoples.|$|E

25|$|Whatever Mao's {{opinion of}} Zhou may have been, there was general {{mourning}} among the public. Foreign correspondents reported that Beijing, shortly after Zhou's death, {{looked like a}} ghost town. There was no burial ceremony, as Zhou had willed his ashes to be scattered across the hills and rivers of his hometown, rather than stored in a ceremonial mausoleum. With Zhou gone, it became clear how <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>people</b> had revered him, and how they had viewed him {{as a symbol of}} stability in an otherwise chaotic period of history. Zhou's death also brought condolences from nations around the world.|$|E

25|$|Cantonese opera shares many common {{characteristics}} {{with other}} Chinese theatre genres. Commentators often {{take pride in}} the idea that all Chinese theatre styles are similar but with minor variations on the pan-Chinese music-theatre tradition and the basic features or principles are consistent from one local performance form to another. Thus, music, singing, martial arts, acrobatics and acting are all featured in Cantonese opera. Most of the plots are based on Chinese history and famous Chinese classics and myths. Also, the culture and philosophies of <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>people</b> {{can be seen in}} the plays. Virtues (like loyalty, love, patriotism and faithfulness) are often reflected by the operas.|$|E
25|$|Japanese bombing {{destroyed}} Chongqing while killing {{hundreds of}} thousands of civilians but failed to break the Chinese will to resist. Another alternative Japanese approach to victory in China was the establishment in November 1938 of a puppet government under Wang Jingwei, the leader of the Kuomintang's left-wing who had lost out to Chiang in the succession struggle following the death of Sun Yat-sen out of the hope that it would lead to an exodus of Kuomintang leaders to Wang's government and thereby cause the collapse of Chiang's government. However, the refusal of the Japanese to give Wang any real power discredited his government as a puppet regime {{in the eyes of the}} vast majority of <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
