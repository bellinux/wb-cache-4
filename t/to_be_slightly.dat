The Sauber team celebrated their 400th Grand Prix in Formula One. The weather was forecast to be wet all weekend, with especially treacherous conditions on Friday afternoon and Saturday, while the race day itself was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> less wet.|$|E
5|$|East Antarctica {{is a cold}} {{region with}} a ground base above sea level and {{occupies}} most of the continent. This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows. The mass balance of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet {{as a whole is}} thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> positive (lowering sea level) or near to balance. However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{began the}} 2008 {{season as the}} third starter in the Yankees' rotation. In his first six starts, he had an 0–4 record and a 9.00 ERA. On April 30, he {{was placed on the}} {{disabled}} list with a strained oblique and cracked rib. On a May 2 visit to an optometrist, Hughes was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> nearsighted; as a result, he started wearing glasses on the mound.|$|E

5|$|In July 2015, {{after nearly}} {{ten years of}} Eris being {{considered}} the ninth-largest object known to directly orbit the sun, close-up imagery from the New Horizons mission more accurately determined Pluto's volume <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> larger than Eris's, rather than slightly smaller as previously thought. Eris is now the tenth-largest object known to directly orbit the sun by volume, though not by mass.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the American Kennel Club(AKC) and the Labrador's breed club {{have set}} the breed {{standard}} to accommodate the field-bred Labrador somewhat. For instance, the AKC withers-height standards allow conformation dogs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> taller than the equivalent British standard. However, dual champions, or dogs that excel in both {{the field and the}} show ring, are becoming more unusual.|$|E
5|$|The Phoenix lander {{returned}} data showing Martian soil <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> alkaline and containing {{elements such}} as magnesium, sodium, potassium and chlorine. These nutrients are found in soils on Earth, and they are necessary for growth of plants. Experiments performed by the lander showed that the Martian soil has a basic pH of 7.7, and contains 0.6% of the salt perchlorate.|$|E

5|$|A 2013 {{study found}} the {{electrical}} conductivity of Hull Creek {{to range from}} 179.50 to 679.00 micro-Siemens per centimeter, {{with an average of}} 283.45 micro-Siemens per centimeter. Only the maximum value was outside of the ideal range. The creek was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> alkaline, with a pH ranging from 6.82 to 8.07. The average pH of the creek was 7.60 and only the maximum value was outside of the ideal range. The concentration of total dissolved solids ranged from 50.00 to 490.00 milligrams per liter, with an average of 167.81 milligrams per liter. Only the maximum value was outside of the ideal range.|$|E
5|$|Although the skulls are incompletely preserved, CT {{scanning}} {{suggests that}} each premaxilla held five incisors, with the sockets becoming progressively larger {{from the first}} to the fifth incisor. Like other theriodonts, the crowns of the incisors are conical; they also lack serrations, unlike gorgonopsians and scylacosaurian therocephalians. The interior edge of the incisors seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> concave, and the back edge {{appears to have a}} ridge. The smaller specimen has a displaced incisor preserved within its nasal cavity; it is more strongly recurved and has wear marks on its top edge, suggesting that it is probably a lower incisor. Its fourth incisor also has a replacement tooth growing behind it, accompanied by resorption of the root.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, the Moon's orbit is also elliptical. The Moon's {{distance}} from the Earth can vary by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's apparent size varies with its {{distance from}} the Earth, {{and it is this}} effect that leads to the difference between total and annular eclipses. The distance of the Earth from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> smaller than the Sun as seen from the Earth, so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. It is only when the Moon is closer to the Earth than average (near its perigee) that a total eclipse occurs.|$|E

5|$|Capella {{has long}} been {{suspected}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> variable. Its amplitude of about 0.1 magnitudes means that it may at times be brighter or fainter than both Rigel and Vega, which are also slightly variable. The system has been classified as an RS Canum Venaticorum variable, a class of binary stars with active chromospheres that cause huge starspots, {{but it is still}} only listed as a suspected variable in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars. Unusually for RS CVn systems, the hotter star, Capella Ab, has the more active atmosphere because it is located in the Hertzsprung gap—a stage where it is changing its angular momentum and deepening its convection zone.|$|E
5|$|Drifting {{generally}} northward, {{the disturbance}} slowly organized within {{a region of}} low to moderate wind shear and favorable outflow aloft. The circulation was enhanced by a surge of westerly winds to the south. At 06:00UTC on June29, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified {{the system as a}} tropical depression. Following further organization, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert that day at 22:30UTC with the system located about 345km (215mi) northeast of Pohnpei. Convection steadily deepened over the center and banding features began consolidating around the periphery. On June30, the JMA upgraded the cyclone to Tropical Storm Chan-hom. The JTWC assessed Chan-hom <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> weaker at this time, initiating it as a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Casey {{was educated}} at Manual Training High School from 1910 to 1914, graduating {{at the age}} of 15. He won a New York State {{scholarship}} and entered Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, where he studied civil engineering. After a year there, he took a competitive examination for the U.S. Military Academy at West Point held by Congressman Daniel J. Griffin, the chairman of the House Committee on Military Affairs, ranking first out of 62 applicants for the appointment. To enter, Casey claimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> older, adopting his brother's 7 June birthday.|$|E

50|$|Yakovlevian torque is the {{tendency}} of {{the right side of}} the human brain <b>to</b> <b>be</b> warped <b>slightly</b> forward relative to the left and the left side of the human brain <b>to</b> <b>be</b> warped <b>slightly</b> backward relative to the right. This is responsible for certain asymmetries, such as how the lateral sulcus of the human brain is often longer and less curved on the left side of the brain relative to the right. It is named for Paul Ivan Yakovlev (1894 - 1983), a Russian-American neuroanatomist from Harvard Medical School.|$|R
5|$|Scarborough's {{climate is}} {{moderate}} for Canada {{due to its}} southerly location within the country and its proximity to Lake Ontario. It has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa/Dfb), with warm, humid summers and generally cold winters. Mean temperature and precipitation tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> lower than the downtown core or south Etobicoke for instance, {{due in part to}} the weather station being farther from the moderating influence of the lake and also because of its more northeast location. Conditions vary based on proximity to the lake, with fog more common in the south and areas close to the lake noticeably cooler on hot summer days.|$|E
5|$|The G {{class were}} ordered {{as part of}} the 1933 Naval Construction Programme, the H class {{following}} in 1934. These ships were based on the preceding F class, but the elimination of cruising turbines and the development of more compact machinery allowed their dimensions and displacement <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> reduced. The H class were repeats of the G's with some minor differences. All of the destroyers were fitted with ASDIC (sonar) and the ability to use the Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear.|$|E
5|$|The Japan Meteorological Agency uses 10-minute {{sustained}} winds, {{while the}} Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses 1-minute sustained winds. The conversion factor {{between the two}} is 1.14x. JMA's peak intensity for Conson was 150km/h (90mph) 10-minute sustained, or 160km/h (105mph) 1-minute sustained. The JTWC's peak intensity for Conson was 185km/h (115mph) 1-minute sustained, or 155km/h (100mph) 10-minute sustained. The National Meteorological Center of China estimated a peak intensity of 150km/h (90mph) 10-minute sustained, or 160km/h (105mph) 1-minute sustained. The Hong Kong Observatory assessed Conson <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> weaker than other agencies, with peak winds estimated at 130km/h (80mph) 10-minute sustained, or 150km/h (90mph) 1-minute sustained.|$|E

5|$|The {{rules of}} chess (also {{known as the}} laws of chess) are rules {{governing}} the {{play of the game}} of chess. While the exact origins of chess are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat from place to place. Today, the standard rules are set by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. There are variations of the rules for fast chess, correspondence chess, online chess, and Chess960.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} processes that shape the Earth. The process of weathering breaks down the rocks and soils into smaller fragments and then into their constituent substances. During rains precipitation, the water droplets absorb and dissolve carbon dioxide from the surrounding air. This causes the rainwater <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> acidic, which aids the erosive properties of water. The released sediment and chemicals are then free to take part in chemical reactions that can affect the surface further (such as acid rain), and sodium and chloride ions (salt) deposited in the seas/oceans. The sediment may reform in time and by geological forces into other rocks and soils. In this way, weather {{plays a major role in}} erosion of the surface.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan saw {{reform of}} the Legislative Council as an {{important}} goal, and later a prime achievement, of his Government. Labor, {{as a matter of}} party policy, wanted to see the Legislative Council abolished. Dunstan, seeing this as unfeasible in his term, set about to reform it instead. Two bills were prepared for Legislative Council reform; one to lower the voting age to 18 and introduce universal suffrage, and another to make councillors elected from a single statewide electorate under a system of proportional representation. The LCL initially blocked both bills, stating that it would only accept them if modifications were made to the second one. Changes were conceded; unlike the House of Assembly, voting would not be compulsory and the preference system was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> altered. Once the amendments were made, the legislation was passed.|$|E
