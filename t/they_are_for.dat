5|$|Mercury(II) oxide, {{the main}} oxide of mercury, arises when the metal {{is exposed to}} air for long periods at {{elevated}} temperatures. It reverts to the elements upon heating near 400°C, as was demonstrated by Joseph Priestley in an early synthesis of pure oxygen. Hydroxides of mercury are poorly characterized, as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>for</b> its neighbors gold and silver.|$|E
5|$|In Grove, Nichols {{divides the}} chamber works into three clearly {{differentiated}} periods. The first four sonatas {{come from the}} early group, all written before Poulenc was twenty-two. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>for</b> two clarinets (1918), piano duo (1918), clarinet and bassoon (1922) and horn, trumpet and trombone (1922). They are early examples of Poulenc's many and varied influences, with echoes of rococo divertissements alongside unconventional harmonies, some influenced by jazz. All four are characterised by their brevity– less than ten minutes each– their mischievousness and their wit, which Nichols describes as acid. Other chamber works from this period are the Rapsodie nègre, FP 3, from 1917 (mainly instrumental, with brief vocal episodes) and the Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano (1926).|$|E
5|$|Hiding {{inside an}} oil field shack while police comb {{the area and}} set up roadblocks, Gil is {{discovered}} by young Suzy who offers to fetch him cookies. Hurrying back to her house, Suzy is caught hoarding cookies by her mother and is forced to reveal who <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>for.</b> While her mother calls the police, Suzy slips {{out of the door}} to return to Gil. Her mother chases after her into the oil field, and police cars soon arrive. Realizing Suzy is endangered by being with him, Gil carries the girl out of the shack into the sunlight where he lets her go. He soon transforms into the creature. In the ensuing police chase, Gil slaughters one of the officers and then climbs the stairs {{to the top of a}} tall natural gas tank, where the remaining officer chases after him. As Gil begins to strangle him, the officer shoots Gil in the neck. Mortally wounded, the mutated Gil falls several stories to his death while Buckell, Hoffman and a sobbing Ann watch in dismay.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{possible}} acceptance criteria: acceptance by empty stack and acceptance by final state. The two are not equivalent for the deterministic pushdown automaton (although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>for</b> the non-deterministic pushdown automaton). The languages accepted by empty stack are those languages that are accepted by final state and are prefix-free: no {{word in the}} language is the prefix of another word in the language.|$|E
25|$|Poppy (Ward) is {{depicted}} as a small, innocent girl, who asks a stranger (most likely Pender) if {{they would like to}} look at her picture book. The book contains pictures of often controversial issues such as the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse or the Ku Klux Klan, but Poppy's narration describes them more naively, suggesting <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> <b>for</b> example, performing acrobatics routines or playing dress-ups.|$|E

25|$|The Tutsi {{have lived}} in the areas where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>for</b> 400–500 years, leading to {{considerable}} intermarriage with the Hutu, a Bantu people in the area. To note the names Hutu and Bantu are not the same. Due to the history of intermingling and intermarrying of Hutus and Tutsis, ethnographers and historians have lately come to agree that Hutu and Tutsis cannot be properly called distinct ethnic groups.|$|E
25|$|The anglicisation of a {{personal}} name now usually depends on the preferences of the bearer. Name changes are less common today for Europeans emigrating to the United States than <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>for</b> people originating in East Asian countries (except for Japan, which no longer has large-scale emigration). For instance, Xiangyun might be anglicised to Sean as the pronunciation is similar (though Sean– or Seán– is Irish and is a Gaelicisation of the Anglo-Norman Jean, which itself has been anglicised to John).|$|E
25|$|The {{old town}} of Riyadh {{within the city}} walls did not exceed an area of 1km2, and {{therefore}} very few significant architectural remnants of the original walled oasis town of Riyadh exist today. The most prominent is the Masmak fort and {{some parts of the}} original wall structure with its gate which have been restored and reconstructed. There are also a number of traditional mud-brick houses within these old limits, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>for</b> the most part dilapidated.|$|E

25|$|Although Gherardello was renowned {{during his}} time for his sacred music, little of it has survived.

25|$|In Kosovo, {{kindergarten}} {{is known}} as Çerdhe or Kopshti i fëmijëve, and they serve as Day Care Centers. There are public and private kindergartens, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>for</b> {{children under the age}} of 3. Children between 3–6 years old go to Institucione parashkollore, which are different from the Day Care Centers, because here children start the basic learning process, and they serve as preparatory institutions for the Primary School. After the age of 6, children continue in Primary School. However, neither the Day Care Centers nor the Preparatory Institutions are mandatory.|$|E
25|$|In {{universities}} in the United Kingdom students' unions are constituted under Section 2 of the Education Act 1994. The ultimate purpose of students' unions is to democratically represent the interests of their members. Students who resign their membership may still use Union social facilities provided (often the main or only such facilities available) since <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>for</b> {{the benefit of the}} students of the institution, not just Union members. The vast majority of UK students' unions are affiliated with the National Union of Students (NUS).|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} current probes, with cores that {{surround}} the conductor carrying current to be examined. One type has a hole for the conductor, and requires that the wire be passed through the hole; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>for</b> semi-permanent or permanent mounting. However, other types, for testing, have a two-part core that permit them to be placed around a wire. Inside the probe, a coil wound around the core provides a current into an appropriate load, and the voltage across that load is proportional to current. However, this type of probe can sense AC, only.|$|E
25|$|An {{essential}} {{question of}} practical reason for Hume was {{whether or not}} standards or principles exist (and if they do, what <b>they</b> <b>are)</b> <b>for</b> practical reason, that are also authoritative for all rational beings, dictating people’s intentions and actions. Hume is mainly considered an anti-rationalist, denying the possibility for practical reason as a principle to exist, although other philosophers such as Christine Korsgaard, Jean Hampton, and Elijah Millgram claim that Hume {{is not so much}} of an anti-rationalist as he is just a skeptic of practical reason.|$|E
25|$|Open {{clusters}} are key {{objects in}} the study of stellar evolution. Because the cluster members are of similar age and chemical composition, their properties (such as distance, age, metallicity and extinction) are more easily determined than <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>for</b> isolated stars. A number of open clusters, such as the Pleiades, Hyades or the Alpha Persei Cluster are visible with the naked eye. Some others, such as the Double Cluster, are barely perceptible without instruments, while many more can be seen using binoculars or telescopes. The Wild Duck Cluster, M11, is an example.|$|E
