5|$|Time {{spent in}} {{religious}} gatherings interfered seriously with the practical routines of the island. Old ladies {{and children who}} made noise in church were lectured at length and warned of dire punishments in the afterworld. During a period of food shortages on the island, a relief vessel arrived on a Saturday, but the minister said that the islanders had <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> preparing for church on the Sabbath, and it was Monday before supplies were landed. Children were forbidden to play games and required to carry a Bible wherever they went. Mackay remained minister on St Kilda for 24 years.|$|E
5|$|Like all fairywrens, {{the splendid}} fairywren {{is an active}} and restless feeder, {{particularly}} on open ground near shelter, but also through the lower foliage. Movement {{is a series of}} jaunty hops and bounces, with its balance assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts. However, splendid fairywrens are stronger fliers than most other fairywrens. During spring and summer, birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during the heat of the day. Food is harder to find during winter and they are required <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> foraging continuously.|$|E

60|$|He {{looked at}} her blankly. It was Sunday, {{and he had been}} looking forward <b>to</b> <b>spending</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> with Mildred. He told himself that he must do that in common decency; he could not leave her by herself in a strange house.|$|R
50|$|Shuangyashan is {{surrounded}} by small mountains, and a large park based around one of these mountains forms a major feature of the outdoor life of the town. During the winter, this pine- and elm-covered mountain forms a lovely area for hiking and general snow play. In summer, the cool Heilongjiang summer, and the very long northern days make this a wonderful area <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>days.</b>|$|R
5|$|Nocturnal in habits, the tawny {{nurse shark}} tends <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> resting in piles of two dozen or more {{individuals}} inside caves or under ledges. At night, it is an active-swimming predator that uses a powerful suction force to extract prey from inside holes and crevices. The diet of this species consists mainly of octopus, though they also take other invertebrates, small bony fishes, and rarely sea snakes. It is aplacental viviparous, meaning the embryos hatch from egg capsules inside the mother. It is the only carpet shark in which the embryos are oophagous, feeding on eggs produced by the mother while inside the uterus. The litter size may be as small as one or two, based on the large size of near-term embryos.|$|E
5|$|The white-winged fairywren is {{primarily}} insectivorous; its diet includes small beetles, bugs, moths, praying mantises, caterpillars, and smaller insects, including spiders. The larger insects are typically fed to nestlings by the breeding female and her helpers, including the breeding male. Adults and juveniles forage by hopping along the shrubland floor, and may supplement their diets with seeds and fruits of saltbush (Rhagodia), goosefoot (Chenopodium) and new shoots of samphire. During spring and summer, birds {{are active in}} bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during {{the heat of the}} day. Food is harder to find during winter and they are required <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> foraging continuously.|$|E
5|$|As {{the family}} gathers around the {{television}} {{to watch the}} local news, Lois states her fondness of the new co-anchor, Joyce Kinney. Later that day, the family attends church, and while there, Lois learns of a local bake sale, and decides to bring her own baked goods. Going to the store to buy ingredients, Lois notices Joyce shopping there as well, and approaches her. The two quickly become close friends, and they decide <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> together at the news studio. That night, Lois and Joyce decide {{to get a drink}} together, and share stories. Reluctant at first to tell Joyce her darkest secret, she soon reveals that she was in a porn film when she was in college in the early 1980s, before she met Peter. Expecting Joyce will keep it a secret, as she promised, she is shocked when the local news reveals her participation in the making of the pornography, and Lois is made a social outcast.|$|E
60|$|To her {{he seemed}} handsomer and more refined {{than in the}} city. He seemed simpler, too, though he was still complex enough to keep her wondering. The slope of his {{shoulders}} and the poise of his head were splendid to her. It could not be possible that he was here to see her; to be served by her; <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> with her; <b>to</b> be her husband if she should say so.|$|R
50|$|The red-faced {{spider monkey}} {{exhibits}} a fission-fusion society, associating with {{large groups of}} up to 30 individuals during the night, but choosing <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> travelling, foraging, and resting in much smaller groups. At dusk, they recongregate using a greeting call to communicate. At night, they often sleep in large groups called bands. Bands typically consist of several females, with their respective young, {{along with a few}} males for protection. The only range size estimate was 255 ha, of which 220 ha had suitable habitat.|$|R
60|$|But now it {{happened}} that news reached Florence of the advance of Louis XII with an army of 20,000 men, bound for Naples {{to settle the dispute}} with Spain. So the Republic--sly and treacherous as any other Italian Government of the Cinquecento--instructed Soderini to temporize with <b>the</b> duke; <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> in amiable, inconclusive interviews and discussions of terms which the Signory did not mean to make. Thus they counted upon gaining time, until the arrival of the French should {{put an end to the}} trouble caused by Vitelli, and to the need for any compromise.|$|R
5|$|In {{suburban}} Chicago, {{near the}} end of the high school year, senior Ferris Bueller fakes sickness to stay home. Throughout the film, Ferris frequently breaks the fourth wall to talk about his friends and give the audience advice on how to skip school. His parents believe him, though his sister Jeannie is not convinced. Dean of Students Edward R. Rooney suspects Ferris is being truant again and commits to catching him. Ferris convinces his friend Cameron Frye, who really is absent due to illness, to help get Ferris' girlfriend Sloane Peterson out of school by reporting that her grandmother has died. To trick Rooney, Ferris sways Cameron to let them use his father's prized 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder to collect Sloane. Cameron is dismayed when Ferris continues to use the car to drive them into downtown Chicago <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> but Ferris promises they will return it as it was.|$|E
5|$|John flirts with Catherine at a ball, {{but she is}} more {{interested}} in meeting with Henry and his sister, Eleanor (Catherine Walker). Catherine is pressured by Isabella and John into riding to Blaise Castle, despite her having made plans for a walk with Henry and Eleanor. John assures her that he saw Henry driving a phaeton to Wick Rocks, but while Catherine is in John's carriage, she sees the Tilneys walking along the street. Catherine asks John to stop, knowing he lied to her, but he refuses. Catherine runs into the Tilney family at the opera and makes her apologies, before planning another walk. John tells Henry's father, General Tilney (Liam Cunningham), that Catherine is the Allens' heir, and the General invites her <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> with the family. Catherine is delighted when she learns Henry and Eleanor love books as much as she does.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, {{the train}} allowed one-day visits by city dwellers. This favoured the setting up of places <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> on the islands, called recreos, and aroused {{interest}} in rowing along the quiet waters.|$|E

Due to their success in winning the MLS Cup in their first season, Houston were invited <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> at the White House on May 29, 2007 and meet with President George W. Bush.|$|E
25|$|As a {{seaside town}} Southport {{has a long}} history of leisure and {{recreation}} and is still heavily dependent on tourism. The town went into decline when cheap air travel arrived in the 1960s and people chose to holiday abroad due to competitive prices and more reliable weather. However, the town kept afloat with people coming <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> by the seaside on bank holidays and weekends. The town has diversified with annual events, shopping and conferences. In 2011 Southport was named the 14th most popular coastal resort in the country, benefiting from a 23% rise in money spent in the resort in that year. Part of the resort's progress is a result of the money invested in Southport over recent years.|$|E
25|$|Philip {{was last}} seen on September 10, 2001. On the day she disappeared, Philip was off from work. According to Lieberman, she was {{planning}} <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> cleaning up the apartment {{in anticipation of a}} dinner visit by her cousin two nights later. She had a two-hour online chat with her mother, during which she mentioned that she was planning to check out the Windows on the World restaurant on top of the nearby North Tower of the World Trade Center, where a friend was to be married the next spring. At 4 p.m. she signed off and went to drop off some clothes at a neighborhood dry cleaners, then went to a Century 21 where she used the couple's American Express card to buy lingerie, a dress, pantyhose and bed linens. Afterwards she bought three pairs of shoes at an annex to the store.|$|E
60|$|To Jacob, {{the warmth}} {{seemed to have}} gone from the sunlight, and the tearing wind was no longer {{bringing}} him joy. Up above him, the long white front of Kelsoton Castle had come into view. His wonderful holiday, then, had come to this--that he must walk, minute by minute, in fear of his liberty, perhaps his life. He was <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> he had looked forward to so much in this lonely spot with {{the men who were}} his sworn enemies. He looked behind him for a moment. The train by which he had come had disappeared long ago across a dark stretch of barren moor. Escape, even if he had thought of it, was cut off.|$|R

25|$|From then on new {{replacement}} B-17s {{coming in from}} the States via India and Africa were barely able {{to keep pace with the}} losses. The airdromes were never safe from enemy attack and being without adequate antiaircraft defenses, planes that could not get off on a combat mission early enough to evade the expected raids were sent away from the airfields at the first alarm <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> cruising aimlessly up and down off the south coast of Java 100 miles west of Malang, putting hour after hour on the engines and increasing the frustration of the crews. On the morning of February 8 nine B-17s of the 7th Group took off on a mission against the airdrome at Kendari from which the Japanese were now launching most of their raids on Java. Almost immediately after taking off the formation was attacked by the Japanese. Three were shot down and the other six jettisoned their bombs and attempted to hide in the clouds. Only one of the nine planes dispatched that morning from Malang one that had returned early with engine trouble, came back undamaged. Nineteen men had been killed.|$|E
500|$|On 15 July 1895, Yeats and Olivia {{traveled}} to Kent to visit Valentine Fox; the trip Harwood says [...] "would have been, emotionally speaking a highly charged outing". Of the railway trip, Yeats {{wrote in his}} memoirs, [...] "when on our first railway journey together—we were <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> at Kent—she gave the long passionate kiss of love, I was startled & a little shocked". They went on to share more passionate kisses in art galleries and at her home.|$|E
500|$|Obama raised {{enough money}} to remain {{competitive}} with Rush. However, he neither connected with the working-class African Americans of the district nor provided a convincing reason for them to vote against Rush. Obama later wrote: [...] "Less than halfway into the campaign, I knew in my bones that I was going to lose. Each morning from that point forward I awoke with a vague sense of dread, realizing that I would have <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> smiling and shaking hands and pretending that everything was going according to plan." ...|$|E

She consults a music teacher for his opinion, but he tells her that, having inherited her father Homer's stubby fingers, she can never be a professional saxophone player. Lisa is therefore required by the test <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> doing chores with her mother Marge, while Bart goes on a ride-along with the police.|$|E

Vince then signs a movie deal with Climax Studios. The studio head asks him <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> with Sherry Wilson (Jennifer Holden), the studio's new leading lady, for publicity purposes. The conceited actress is less than thrilled with her co-star at first; but she eventually {{falls in love with}} Vince after shooting a kissing scene, saying that she's [...] "come all unglued" [...] (indicating that she's no longer [...] "stuck up").|$|E

Homer convinces the couple {{to allow him to}} be their assistant, while keeping it secret that the celebrity couple are in Springfield. Homer, at first, works well with the couple, and they all become good friends. Homer scares Ron Howard when he visits the couple, and soon attempts to pitch a screenplay about a [...] "killer robot driving instructor that travels back in time for some reason," [...] as well as a talking pie, the robot's best friend. Both his attempts at writing for the couple are unsuccessful.|$|E
