50|$|In 1910, Loren and {{his wife}} Lucille moved to Dayton, Ohio, and, on a shoestring budget, began The Ohio Guide Company, {{printing}} timetables. He recognized the opportunities for Yellow Pages and soon concentrated on a <b>telephone</b> <b>directory</b> operation that, as L. M. Berry and Company, developed into a coast-to-coast enterprise {{and became one of}} the foremost <b>telephone</b> <b>directory</b> publishers in the United States, handling {{one out of every four}} <b>telephone</b> <b>directories</b> in the United States.|$|R
50|$|A reverse <b>telephone</b> <b>directory</b> (also {{known as}} a gray pages directory, {{criss-cross}} directory or reverse phone lookup) {{is a collection of}} telephone numbers and associated customer details. However, unlike a standard <b>telephone</b> <b>directory,</b> where the user uses customer's details (such as name and address) in order to retrieve the telephone number of that person or business, a reverse <b>telephone</b> <b>directory</b> allows users to search by a telephone service number in order to retrieve the customer details for that service.|$|R
30|$|A second {{option is}} the <b>telephone</b> <b>directory.</b> Machine-readable <b>telephone</b> <b>directories</b> are {{available}} online and on CD. They have frequently {{been used for}} selection using name-based methods. They yield household samples and require a subsequent random selection of a target person. The attractions of this approach are ease of access at very low cost and national coverage in a homogeneous data set. The existence of the telephone number facilitates telephone surveying. But (a) it is unclear if using participant data for surveys is permissible because under German law personal data may not be processed without consent. Phone owners consent to publication of their data for telecommunication purposes only. (b) Households that have a landline but no <b>telephone</b> <b>directory</b> entry cause distortion (Deutschmann & Häder, 2002; Häder, 1996): unlisted subscribers are disproportionately low-income households, live in large cities, are more mobile, younger, and tenants rather than owner-occupiers. As for the <b>telephone</b> <b>directory</b> entries of immigrants, further misrepresentation was observed. Sauer and Goldberg (2001, p. 29) found a surplus of middle age groups, singles, self-employed, and large households in the <b>telephone</b> <b>directory</b> vis-à-vis the microcensus. Comparing <b>telephone</b> <b>directory</b> samples of several nationalities with the microcensus, Santacreu Fernández, Rother, and Braun (2006) found discrepancies {{in the distribution of}} gender, marital status, age, age at migration, migration period, education, and employment status. Salentin (2002) attempted to re-identify a population register sample in the <b>telephone</b> <b>directory.</b> This was possible for 65 % of the people of Turkish origin but only 40 % of those from Serbia. (c) The <b>telephone</b> <b>directory</b> is shrinking rapidly. The total number of entries fell from 40 millions in 1998 to 22.9 millions in 2015, and the number identified as being of Turkish origin decreased by 54.4 % (Wittlif & Beigang, 2016, p. 9). According to Salentin (2014, p. 36) just 36 % of households were listed in 2011 / 2012. (d) Apart from the names, <b>telephone</b> <b>directory</b> entries contain no indicators of migration background. The scope of the resulting samples is thus limited. These are certainly strong arguments against using the <b>telephone</b> <b>directory</b> beyond merely exploratory studies.|$|R
25|$|A <b>{{telephone}}</b> <b>directory</b> is {{a listing}} of telephone subscribers in a geographical area or subscribers to services provided by the organization that publishes the directory. R.

50|$|In the 21st century, printed <b>telephone</b> <b>directories</b> are {{increasingly}} criticized as waste. In 2012, after some North American cities passed laws banning {{the distribution of}} telephone books, an industry group sued and obtained a court ruling permitting the distribution to continue.

50|$|In Iceland, listings {{such as the}} <b>telephone</b> <b>directory</b> are alphabetised {{by first}} name rather than surname. To reduce ambiguity, the <b>telephone</b> <b>directory</b> goes further by also listing professions. In Russia, where name-patronyms of similar style were {{historically}} used (such as Ivan Petrovich), the much larger population necessitated the introduction of surnames, and delegated the patronymic to record-keeping middle-name and conversational honorific.|$|R
