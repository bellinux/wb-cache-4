40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} is to {{understand}} the social mechanisms for why people <b>go</b> <b>to</b> work when they are sick. To understand it, we investigated why upper secondary school teachers sickness presenteeism increased in the last twenty years. Data consists of interviews with eleven upper secondary school teachers and two principals, plus statistics. To find patterns in the data we examined the theory of professions and {{the theory of the}} new capitalist culture. School budgets are based on support from the government that provides money for each student. Since 1992 free schools are allowed in Sweden. This creates a competition between schools, which may lead <b>to</b> programs in <b>schools</b> with insufficient applicant students to be shut down. The results show that the market's growing influence in schools has given upper secondary school teachers an increased social function. The customer, in this case the students and parents, has become more at the center. This new task, the student caring role, forces the teacher to be more accessible and flexible which has made their profession weaker, giving them more stress and in a longer term, they are feeling sick more often. A combination between a striving to keep up their profession and to not losing students, <b>teachers</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> even if they’re sick. ...|$|R

He dedicated his first album to them [...] "for being so understanding and tolerant" [...] during his formative years. Early musical interests included drums, piano, saxophone and composition.

He was particularly enamored of his brother's record collection. It seems that a hometown drummer, John Jarette, advised Henderson to listen to musicians like Lester Young, Stan Getz, Dexter Gordon and Charlie Parker. He also liked Flip Phillips, Lee Konitz and the Jazz at the Philharmonic recordings. However, Parker became his greatest inspiration. His first approach to the saxophone was under the tutelage of Herbert Murphy in high school. In this period of time, he wrote several scores for the school band and rock groups.|$|R

This paper {{focuses on the}} strategies that {{have been put in}} place by public primary <b>schools</b> <b>to</b> improve performance based on a study of schools in Kibirichia Division in Meru Central District, Kenya. The study also sought suggestions from the residents on other strategies that could be put in place to improve performance in the area. The population of the study was 451 respondents. The population comprised standard 8 pupils, assistant teachers and head teachers. Purposive, stratified and random sampling techniques were used. A sample size of all 12 head teachers, 60 assistant teachers and 120 standard 8 pupils was used. Different questionnaires were used for the head teachers, assistant teachers and pupils for data collection. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. The study found that a number of strategies have been put in place to improve performance by the schools in the area. The school management committees have PTA teachers. Pupils report early in school and schools and parents/guardians reward pupils who have done well. Many students like speaking in English in the absence of teachers. Students have story books and were punished for doing mistakes where teachers and the administration administer the punishments. There is a monitor for speaking vernacular and schools do Continuous Assessment tests {{in the middle of the}} term. <b>Teachers</b> have <b>gone</b> back <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>to</b> improve their academic qualifications and professionalism. Female teachers are more and are taking leadership roles. Teachers are opting for subject specialization because they are not comfortable with teaching all subjects. Parents like remedial teaching and students have a liking for the hard subjects. Students are informed on careers after completing their studies. The study recommends that the government employs more teachers, induct new head teachers; schools have a common library and subject specialization in primary schools. The study is expected to provide insight reference to policy makers, scholars and researchers on ways to improving performance in public primary schools in Kenya...|$|R
