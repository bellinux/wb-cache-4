5|$|After his stint {{with the}} Penguins in 2015, Sprong rejoined <b>the</b> <b>Islanders</b> for the {{remainder}} of the 2015–16 season. He played 33 games for <b>the</b> <b>Islanders</b> and recorded 46 points. The team made the playoffs, where Sprong scored a further 15 points before the team was eliminated in the second round. An injury sustained during practice with the Penguins during the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs kept Sprong out until January, 2017 when he rejoined Charlottetown. He only played 31 games that season, but finished with 59 points, the highest points-per-game average in the entire league. He finished his career with <b>the</b> <b>Islanders</b> with the third goals and second most points in team history, and during the playoffs he tied the record for most career goals and broke the records for most assists and points. Sprong led <b>the</b> <b>Islanders</b> in scoring with 20 points in 12 games as the team lost in the third round of the playoffs, ending his junior career. Following that he was recalled again by the Penguins to train with them during their time in the NHL playoffs.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} {{settlers}} of the municipality, <b>the</b> <b>Islanders</b> {{and their descendants}} were designated hidalgos. The established settlers resented <b>the</b> <b>Islanders</b> for their new titles and exclusive privileges within the city government. The newcomers {{did not know how}} to handle horses, rendering them useless in mounted warfare against the Apaches. Unlike the established settlers, who relied on ranching, <b>the</b> <b>Islanders</b> were primarily farmers, and their refusal to build fences led to many disagreements when livestock trampled the fields. By the early 1740s, however, intermarriage and the need for closer economic ties had helped to alleviate some of the infighting, and the original settlers were given permission to serve as magistrates and council members.|$|E

In January 2011 Grabner was {{selected}} {{to participate in the}} 2011 SuperSkills as one of twelve rookies in the competition, winning the fastest skater competition with times of 14.061 and 14.238. In February, Grabner led all rookies in scoring with 10 goals and 16 points. He also had a six-game goal scoring streak, which was the longest rookie streak since the 2006–07 season when Evgeni Malkin also scored in six straight. For his efforts Grabner was named rookie of the month. He finished his rookie year with 34 goals and 52 points, his goal total leading all rookies, as well as <b>the</b> <b>Islanders.</b> Ranking third in rookie points Grabner earned a Calder Memorial Trophy nomination for NHL rookie of the year. Following his successful rookie year <b>the</b> <b>Islanders</b> signed Grabner to a five-year, $15 million contract extension on 13 May 2011, backloaded to start at $1M and then increase by another $1M each year.|$|E

5|$|After playing {{just three}} {{games of the}} 1999–2000 NHL season, Brewer was {{assigned}} to the Islanders' AHL affiliate, the Lowell Lock Monsters. It was speculated that the reason behind this move was laziness by Brewer, who was benched during the final thirty minutes by head coach Butch Goring after losing a race for the puck against Mike Knuble in the Islanders' October 11, 1999, loss to the New York Rangers. Brewer also took a bad penalty earlier in the game, putting <b>the</b> <b>Islanders</b> down two men. After a two-week, five-game stint with the Lock Monsters, Brewer was subsequently recalled by <b>the</b> <b>Islanders.</b> After playing 26 games with <b>the</b> <b>Islanders</b> in which he only recorded two assists, Brewer was reassigned to the Lock Monsters on January 8, 2000, {{for the remainder of the}} season. Shortly after joining the Lock Monsters, Brewer suffered a sprained knee and missed the next two-and-a-half months of the season. Brewer went on to play 25 games for the Lock Monsters, recording two goals and two assists.
