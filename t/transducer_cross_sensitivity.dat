40|$|Ammonia gases {{have their}} own {{advantages}} and disadvantages; however {{it is important to}} monitar ammonia emission to avoid hazardous level. Ultraviolet or broadband Infrared absorption, and Photothermal Deflection prevent the speciesconversion, time delay, and adsorption problems associated with traditional sampling systems, but often use expensive, bulky or delicate radiation sources that are not suitable for commercialisation. In gas detection, <b>cross</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is one of the constraints since the air consists of a variety of gases. A few techniques were introduced such as using gas separation techniques or ratio calculation to overcome the problem. For ammonia gas sensing, {{it has been reported that}} the <b>cross</b> <b>sensitivity</b> with humidity is the main problem and this occurs in certain wavelength ranges. This is a strong indication that <b>cross</b> <b>sensitivity</b> for ammonia emission monitoring must be modelled. Choosing suitable wavelength of ammonia with minimal <b>cross</b> <b>sensitivity</b> effect can reduce the effect of <b>cross</b> <b>sensitivity</b> at infrared region. In this numerical prediction analysis, the optical transmission of ammonia was obtained through a model developed using a commercial simulator SpectralCalc-GATS, OptiSystem and Matlab. The developed model is then interfaced with the integrated sensor system model using OptiSystem for system performance and characterisation. The simulation shows that ammonia absorption cross section within 2200 nm to 2400 nm region has less <b>cross</b> <b>sensitivity</b> issues. It is not possible to discuss the <b>cross</b> <b>sensitivity</b> issue for every single atmospheric gas as there are too many gases in the atmosphere and the amount is small and subject to the surrounding environment.

System functionality of the force sensor should comply with many reliability aspects peculiar to aerospace industry rather than just sensing the applied force. Final design of the dual axis force sensor is based on three preliminary design concepts and test data of fabricated models.

Furthermore this work presents the practical circumstances faced during fabricating and testing. Analysis of results are also discussed in the report and comparison of the first three models included in the report. Functional requirements were fine tuned in the final design compared to the first three design concepts. Major requirement was to reduce the <b>cross</b> <b>sensitivity</b> {{when it came to the}} final design.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel capacitive strain gauge with interdigital electrodes, which was processed on polyimide and LCP (liquid crystal polymer) foil substrates. The metallization is deposited and patterned using thin-film technology with structure sizes down to 15 μm. We determined linear strain sensitivities for our sensor configuration and identified the most influencing parameters on the output signal {{by means of}} an analytical approach. Finite-element method (FEM) simulations of the strain gauge indicated the complex interaction of mechanical strains within the sensitive structure and their effect on the capacitance. The influence of geometry and material parameters on the strain sensitivity was investigated and optimized. We implemented thin films on 50 μm thick standard polymer foils by means of a temporary bonding process of the foils on carrier wafers. The characterization of the strain sensors after fabrication revealed the gauge factor as well as the <b>cross</b> <b>sensitivities</b> on temperatures up to 100 °C and relative humidity up to 100 %.

Sensors based on anodic biofilms that oxidize organic substrates like acetate as living recognition element are promising for online monitoring of anaerobic digestion (AD), wastewater treatment {{as well as}} other processes. Essential for future engineering of microbial electrochemical sensors is the detailed characterization of its <b>cross</b> <b>sensitivity</b> as well as response behavior and latency. These parameters were examined on the example of a microbial electrochemical acetate sensor build in a 100 mL continuously stirred tank reactor. Furthermore, the ability of the sensor to recover after different periods (5 – 10 days) of shut down (i. e. open cell potential (OCP)) was studied. The sensor showed <b>cross</b> <b>sensitivity</b> towards propionate and butyrate that can be described as a baseline sum signal (0. 040 ± 0. 008 mAcm− 2) irrespective of the applied concentration. The sensor also revealed biphasic response behavior towards dynamic changes in acetate concentration shown to be strongly dependent on prior exposure to low acetate concentrations. This behavior is discussed by means of the metabolic state of the microbial cells forming the recognition element. Furthermore, the sensor revealed full recovery of activity after three consecutive OCP periods showing that sensor shutdown is not a limiting factor.
