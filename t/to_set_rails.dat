50|$|A {{plan for}} a rail system in India was first put forward in 1832.

The John Company (and later the colonial government) encouraged new railway companies backed by private investors under a scheme that would provide land and guarantee an annual return of up to five percent during the initial years of operation. The companies were to build and operate the lines under a 99-year lease, with the government having the option to buy them earlier.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{normative}} work aimed at identifying locations in Russia with high, medium and unclear potentials for logistics cluster development. As a framework this work uses four different models of logistics clusters: Major Seaport, Auxiliary Seaport, Major Inland and Auxiliary Inland logistics clusters. Conclusions {{are based on}} analysis of port connectivity, population incomes within eight hours of driving from a specific location, auto roads accessibility, economic effectiveness of local government and quality of auto roads. This paper provides guidelines for decision makers about how <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up the <b>rail</b> infrastructure {{in order to support}} the logistics development across different parts of Russia. Furthermore, this work suggests where future research should be amplified, especially concerning the quality of input data. by Andriy Tantsuyev. Thesis (M.

50|$|The {{second problem}} was the rail system. In a bid to create efficiencies, the Government had split the rail system into {{distinct}} organisations covering track, rolling stock, freight and passengers. Following a spate of accidents, including fatalities at Springwood in December 1999, a commission of inquiry was appointed. Its findings were that the accidents stemmed from confusion in the new structure of the rail system, and also a failure by the railway organisation to view safety as an operational goal. Another accident at Waterfall {{a month before the}} official start of the election campaign looked <b>set</b> <b>to</b> make <b>rail</b> safety a critical election issue, but the cause {{turned out to be the}} demise of the driver at the controls. Events after the election were to reveal major problems in the rail system, but they were not to become major issues in the campaign.|$|R

50|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1980s various railroads experimented with the RoadRailer concept to {{determine}} if the equipment would be durable enough to endure railroad use. The positive attributes of the RoadRailer were its exceptionally smooth ride, light weight and low capital costs <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up a <b>rail</b> yard. Since no flatcars were involved, no crane systems were needed to transfer the trailers between modes. In fact during one demonstration test a train of RoadRailers was broken {{down in the middle of}} an industrial street in Portland Oregon which happened to have track in the street, demonstrating the flexibility of the system. Another note was that a RoadRailer train did not have a caboose car which at the time was still required for freight trains. A box was designed with a yellow strobe light, and equipment for monitoring air pressure through the brake line was designed to be installed in the unused coupler of the last car. Later, as cabooses were phased out, railroads moved to their current use of a similar strobe to mark the end of the train (the so-called flashing rear-end device or FRED).|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a tool for}} use by organizational management teams to plan, manage, and oversee personnel exposures within their organizations. The report encompasses personnel radiation exposures received from activities associated with the B-Cell Cleanout Project, Surveillance and Maintenance Project, the Mk- 42 Project, and other minor activities. It {{is designed to provide}} verifiable Radiological Performance Reports. The primary area workers receive radiation exposure is the Radiochemical Engineering Complex airlock. Entry to the airlock is necessary for maintenance of cranes and other equipment, and <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up the <b>rail</b> system used to move large pieces of equipment and shipping casks {{into and out of the}} airlock. Transfers of equipment and materials from the hot cells in the complex to the airlock are required to allow dose profiles of waste containers, shuffling of waste containers to allow grouting activities to go on, and to allow maintenance of in-cell cranes. Both DOE and the Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) are currently investing in state-of-the-art decontamination equipment. Challenging goals for exposure reduction were established for several broad areas of activity. Exposure estimates and goals developed from these scheduled activities will be compared against actual exposures for scheduled and unscheduled activities that contributed to exposures received by personnel throughout the year. Included in this report are life cycle exposure estimates by calendar year for the B-Cell Cleanout project, a three-year estimate of exposures associated with Surveillance and Maintenance, and known activities for Calendar Year (CY) 1995 associated with several smaller projects. These reports are intended to provide a foundation for future dose estimates, by year, requiring updating as exposure conditions change or new avenues of approach to performing work are developed...|$|R
