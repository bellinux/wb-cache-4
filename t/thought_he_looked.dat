5|$|In the {{practice}} nets, the county players towered over Larwood; the veteran Test batsman George Gunn <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> {{more like a}} jockey than a cricketer. At first he bowled badly, and his efforts were unimpressive. As his confidence increased his bowling improved, and committee members began to revise their initial dismissive judgement; when the session ended, Larwood was offered a playing contract. He accepted instantly; the terms were 32 shillings (£1.60) per week—the same as his mining wages—and he was expected, when not playing, to carry out ground staff duties. Robert Larwood was angry that his son had not asked for more generous terms, but according to Hamilton, Harold would have agreed to anything {{to escape from the}} mine, even for a single summer.|$|E
25|$|This pencil-slim youngster bowled off-spinners in {{the first}} innings with a highly suspect and jerky action...but no one bothered much about {{him because of his}} {{comparatively}} modest success. The balloon really went up in the second innings when he used the new ball...I <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> less like a chucker when bowling quick but the M.C.C. were incensed.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the young}} Kashgari women were most {{attractive}} in appearance, {{and some of the}} little girls quite lovely, their plaits of long hair falling from under a jaunty little embroidered cap, their big dark eyes, flashing teeth and piquant olive faces reminding me of Italian or Spanish children. One most beautiful boy stands out in my memory. He was clad in a new shirt and trousers of flowered pink, his crimson velvet cap embroidered with gold, and as he smiled and salaamed to us I <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> like a fairy prince. The women wear their hair in two or five plaits much thickened and lengthened by the addition of yak's hair, but the children in several tiny plaits.|$|E
60|$|Wingrave {{had just}} come in from an early gallop. His pale cheeks were {{slightly}} flushed, {{and his eyes were}} bright. He had been riding hard to escape from disconcerting <b>thoughts.</b> <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> in at the study, and found Aynesworth with a mass of correspondence before him.|$|R

500|$|Carter said of {{the casting}} of Nick Chinlund as Pfaster, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} wonderfully creepy villain. The casting of that show was very difficult. We saw many actors, but there was a quality I was looking for and I couldn't put a name on that quality. I finally figured out what it was when Nick came in and he had a kind of {{androgynous}} quality that worked. I <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> like Joe College, but he could scare the hell out of you." [...] Producer Glen Morgan said Chinlund's performance was outstanding. Nutter stated [...] "Nick Chinlund was wonderful to work with. The guy was like putty in my hands. He was great. If you're looking for someone to underline the weirdness and strangeness of the character, he did that." ...|$|E
500|$|Cardus often {{expressed}} views {{contrary to}} popular and critical opinion. He dismissed Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring as [...] "a sophisticated exploitation of primitive rum-ti-tum". When Harty introduced Gershwin's symphonic poem An American in Paris into a Hallé concert, Cardus proposed [...] "a 150 per cent [...] tariff against this sort of American dry-goods". He professed to think that Sullivan's [...] "preoccupation with comic opera, {{to the neglect of}} oratorio and symphony" [...] was a [...] "deplorable" [...] loss to English music, although he also wrote that without Gilbert, nothing of Sullivan's music would have survived. Cardus championed Delius against the consensus of his fellow-critics: [...] "His music looks back on days intensely lived through; it knows the pathos of mortal things doomed to fade and vanish". At the 1929 Delius Festival in London, Cardus briefly met the composer, who <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> too young to be The Manchester Guardians music critic, and counselled him: [...] "Don't read yourself daft. Trust to y'r emotions". Also against the grain of critical opinion, Cardus commended the then unfashionable music of Richard Strauss and Anton Bruckner.|$|E

40|$|The {{writings}} of few twentieth-century theologians {{have been as}} widely read as those of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, however Peter Potter argues that misinterpretation of certain key phrases in English translations of his work has led to serious confusion about aspects of his <b>thought.</b> <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> in particular at the phrase 'a world come of age', examining in detail how {{a deeper understanding of}} Bonhoeffer's intention has so much more to say to us today than has often been apparent in studies of his work.

500|$|Although the {{military}} had officially barred or restricted the recruitment of Aborigines in earlier periods, these impediments were significantly relaxed after Japan entered World WarII, and Australia came under direct attack for the first time. Waters volunteered for service in the RAAF on 24August 1942, at Brisbane, and was accepted. He began training as an aircraft mechanic, but later volunteered for flying service, and commenced initial training at Somers, Victoria, in December 1943. The aircrew interviewer <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> [...] "a bit rough" [...] but [...] "should make a fighter". Waters believed his lack of education would be a disadvantage, and studied nights {{to make up for}} it. Keen to be a pilot, he was concerned that he would be allocated to duty as a wireless operator because he showed an aptitude for Morse transmission early on. He was also asked to imagine himself as the tail gunner in a Lancaster or Halifax heavy bomber, to which he replied, [...] "I had a very disappointed look on my face, sir!" [...] So convinced was he that he would not achieve his dream of becoming an aviator, Waters made three separate bets against himself being selected, and had to pay out £15 when he was nevertheless chosen.|$|E
2500|$|When Indian Larry {{first met}} {{the woman that}} would become his wife, Andrea [...] "Bambi" [...] Cambridge, in 1996, her first {{impression}} of him is that she <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> like [...] "a total mass-murderer". [...] People would {{go out of their}} way to avoid him on the subway, but the moment Larry would start talking he'd instantly put them at ease with his sense of humor.|$|E
2500|$|Keith Slater: Slater {{was another}} bowler accused of {{throwing}} during the series, {{but as he}} only took 2 Test wickets for 110 runs he was {{not considered to be}} a major problem. At the MCC's first game in Perth Keith Miller wrote [...] "this pencil-slim youngster bowled off-spinners in the first innings with a highly suspect and jerky action...but no one bothered much about him because of his comparatively modest success.

2500|$|God, {{that was}} horrible. That was when Ray tried to top himself.

Ray suddenly {{announced that he was}} going to end it all ... I think he took the pills before the show. I said to him towards the end that he was getting a bit crazy. I didn't know what happened—I suddenly got a phone call saying he was in the hospital. I remember going to the hospital after they'd pumped his stomach and it was bad.|$|E
2500|$|Terre'Blanche {{submitted}} a sworn {{statement to the}} London court denying {{that he had had}} an affair with Allan, saying [...] "All these attempts to exaggerate the extent of my relationship with Miss Allan will ultimately be seen for what they are - a pack of lies." [...] Allan's case was dealt a heavy blow by the statements of her former flatmate, Linda Shaw, the Sunday Times astrologer. Shaw testified in court that Allan had told her that {{she was in love with}} Terre'Blanche and wanted to marry him. She admitted that she knew about the relationship early on and that Allan had described Terre'Blanche as a [...] "great lay, but a little heavy". Allan rebuffed these claims in court, describing Terre'Blanche's physical appearance unfavourably: [...] "I've always <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> rather like a pig in a safari suit." [...] Shaw described how she had peeped through a keyhole and witnessed Allan in a compromising position with a large man. Allan's QC, Charles Gray dismissed Shaw's [...] "wildly unlikely" [...] testimony and stressed the physical impossibility of her claim. He continued to express that her field of vision through the keyhole would not be sufficient to support her claim.|$|E
2500|$|Russell Johnson is Professor Roy Hinkley, Ph.D. Actor John Gabriel was {{originally}} cast, but the network <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> {{too young to}} have all the degrees attributed to the Professor. Actually, [...] "the Professor" [...] was in fact a high school science teacher, not a university professor. [...] In the first episode, the radio announcer describes him as a research scientist and well known scoutmaster. Johnson, who served as a bombardier in the Pacific during World War II, stated that he had some difficulty remembering his more technically oriented lines. Originally, he was not interested in the role, and was waiting for a TV show of his own, but his agent talked him into auditioning. He had done previous movies like It Came from Outer Space, This Island Earth, and a classic western where he shot Ronald Reagan in the shoulder. Johnson's role in the series was spoofed in a Bloom County comic strip for the Professor's technical expertise being unable to get the castaways off the island. This odd contradiction was played up in [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic's parody song, [...] "Isle Thing", when the Professor, who is brilliant enough to [...] "make a nuclear reactor from a couple of coconuts" [...] cannot [...] "build a lousy raft".|$|E
60|$|Balancin {{was pleased}} with the young man's voice and appearance, and <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> as if <b>he</b> knew what he was doing. So he {{stretched}} out his bad foot which the youth examined with great attention, and then gently laid on the plaster.|$|R

60|$|Kendricks {{nodded and}} left the room. Julien sat {{for a moment before}} the open window. It was rather an {{impressive}} view of the city with its millions of lights, the fine buildings of the Place de la Concorde in clear relief against the deep sky, the Eiffel Tower glittering in the distance, the subtle perfume of pleasure in the air. Julien stood there and raised his eyes to the skies. Already his brain was moving to the grim music of his <b>thoughts.</b> <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> away from the city to the fertile country. Some faint memory of those once blackened fields and desolate villages stole into his mind. He turned to his desk, drew the paper towards him and wrote.|$|R
