Apple doubled its manufacturing space in 1990 by expanding its Singapore and Cork, Ireland factories, where <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> was assembled. Air freight, rather than sea shipping, {{was used to}} speed delivery. The shortage caused concern among dealers, who blamed Apple's poor business planning.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the process}} that was {{to lead to the}} 1996 Doctor Who film, Universal Television had Amblin Entertainment produce a writers' bible which {{detailed}} John Leekley's proposed pilot and episodes of a new series.

It is unclear whether clearance could have been obtained for all the episodes detailed, as the costs would likely have fallen to the BBC.|$|E
5|$|From {{as early}} as the Preclassic period, the ruler of a Maya polity was {{expected}} to be a distinguished war leader, and was depicted with trophy heads hanging from his belt. In <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> period, such trophy heads no longer appeared on the king's belt, but Classic period kings are frequently depicted standing over humiliated war captives. Right up {{to the end of the}} Postclassic period, Maya kings led as war captains. Maya inscriptions from <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> show that a defeated king could be captured, tortured, and sacrificed. The Spanish recorded that Maya leaders kept track of troop movements in painted books.|$|E

5|$|In {{common with}} other Mesoamerican cultures, the Maya worshipped {{feathered}} serpent deities. Such worship was rare during <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> period, {{but by the}} Postclassic the feathered serpent had spread to both the Yucatán Peninsula and the Guatemalan Highlands. In Yucatán, the feathered serpent deity was Kukulkan, among the K'iche' it was Q'uq'umatz. Kukulkan had his origins in <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> period War Serpent, Waxaklahun Ubah Kan, and has also been identified as the Postclassic version of the Vision Serpent of Classic Maya art. Although the cult of Kukulkan had its origins in these earlier Maya traditions, the worship of Kukulkan was heavily influenced by the Quetzalcoatl cult of central Mexico. Likewise, Q'uq'umatz had a composite origin, combining the attributes of Mexican Quetzalcoatl with aspects of <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> period Itzamna.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on twelve children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.|$|E
