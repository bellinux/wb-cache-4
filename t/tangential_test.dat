40|$|In an {{arbitrary}} axisymmetric stationary spacetime, we determine the expression for the <b>tangential</b> velocity of <b>test</b> objects following a circular stable geodesic {{motion in the}} equatorial plane, as function of the metric coefficients. Next, we impose the condition, observed in large samples of disks galaxies, that the magnitude of such tangential velocity be radii independent in the dark matter dominated region, obtaining a con-straint equation among the metric coefficients, and thus arriving to an iff 3 condition: The <b>tangential</b> velocity of <b>test</b> particles is radii independent iff the metric coefficients satisfied the mentioned constraint equation. Furthermore, for the static case, the con-straint equation can be easily integrated, leaving the spacetime at the equatorial plane essentially with only one independent metric coefficient. With the geometry thus fixed, we compute the Einstein tensor and equate it to {{an arbitrary}} stress energy tensor, {{in order to determine}} the type of energy-matter which could produce such a geometry. Within an approximation, we deduce a constraint equation among the components of the stress energy tensor. We test in that constraint equation several well known types of matter, which have been proposed as dark matter candidates and are able to point for possible right ones. Finally, we also present the spherically symmetric static case and apply the mentioned procedure to perfect fluid stress energy tensor, recovering the Newtonian result as well as the one obtained in the axisymmetric case. We also present arguments on the need to use GR to study types of matter different than the dust one. KEY WORDS: Disk of matter; test particle; axisymmetric stationary spacetime...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the possibility that}} dark matter {{is a mixture of}} two non-interacting perfect fluids, with different four-velocities and thermodynamic parameters. The two-fluid model can be described as an effective single anisotropic fluid, with distinct radial and tangential pressures. The basic equations describing the equilibrium structure of the two-fluid dark matter model, and of the <b>tangential</b> velocity of <b>test</b> particles in stable circular orbits, are obtained for the case of a spherically symmetric static geometry. By assuming a non-relativistic kinetic model for the dark matter particles, the density profile and the tangential velocity of the dark matter mixture are obtained by numerically integrating the gravitational field equations.

40|$|Objective This study {{compared}} the primary stability of two commercially available acetabular components {{from the same}} manufacturer, which differ only in geometry; a hemispherical and a peripherally enhanced design (peripheral self-locking (PSL)). The objective {{was to determine whether}} altered geometry resulted in better primary stability. Methods Acetabular components were seated with 0. 8 mm to 2 mm interference fits in reamed polyethylene bone substrate of two different densities (0. 22 g/cm 3 and 0. 45 g/cm 3). The primary stability of each component design was investigated by measuring the peak failure load during uniaxial pull-out and <b>tangential</b> lever-out <b>tests.</b> Results There was no statistically significant difference in seating force (p = 0. 104) or primary stability (pull-out p = 0. 171, lever-out p = 0. 087) of the two components in the low-density substrate. Similarly, in the high-density substrate, there was no statistically significant difference in the peak pull-out force (p = 0. 154) or lever-out moment (p = 0. 574) between the designs. However, the PSL component required a significantly higher seating force thanthe hemispherical cup in the high-density bone analogue (p = 0. 006). Conclusions Higher seating forces associated with the PSL design may result in inadequate seating and increased risk of component malpositioning or acetabular fracture in the intra-operative setting in high-density bone stock. Our results, if translated clinically, suggest that a purely hemispherical geometry may have an advantage over a peripherally enhanced geometry in high density bone stock...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In Pulsed Eddy Current (PEC) testing, the {{response}} feature of one-dimensional magnetic field component, {{perpendicular to the}} conductorâ€™s surface, is used to detect and quantify the defects. It is not sufficient for signal interpretation and noise suppression. A novel PEC probe, which consists of a tangential driver-coil and three orthorhombic pickup coils, is introduced in this paper. It is greatly advantageous to realize three dimensional field components measurement independently. Moreover it is characteristic of self-difference and lower lift-off noise. Using Finite Element Method (FEM), three dimensional magnetic flux density responses due to a defect in conductor plate, have been calculated. The result shows that a defectâ€™s depth and edges can be evaluated quantitatively by extracting three dimensional field components responses features. Numerical predication is in good agreement with experimental measurement. These merits are valuable for imaging inspection of defects (such as corrosion, dent, rivet hole, etc) in the aircraft structures.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the behavior of}} the <b>tangential</b> velocity of <b>test</b> particles moving in stable circular orbits in f (R) modified theories of gravity. A large number of observations at the galactic scale have shown that the rotational velocities of massive test particles (hydrogen clouds) tend towards constant values at large distances from the galactic center. We analyze the vacuum gravitational field equations in f (R) models in the constant velocity region, and the general form of the metric tensor is derived in a closed form. The resulting modification of the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian is of the form R 1 + n, with the parameter n expressed in terms of the tangential velocity. Therefore we find that to explain the motion of test particles around galaxies requires only very mild deviations from classical general relativity, and that modified gravity can explain the galactic dynamics without the need of introducing dark matter.

We construct several models of disks with axially symmetric perfect fluid halos. All disks have some common features: surface energy density and pressure decrease monotonically and rapidly with the radius. As the "cut" parameter a decreases, the disks become more relativistic, with the surface energy density and pressure more concentrated near the center.

40|$|Strengthening of {{existing}} reinforced concrete structures by using composite materials {{has been growing}} in popularity, since they are characterized by high strength-to-weight ratios and good versatility. Recently, beside common Fibre-Reinforced Polymers (FRP) that consist in various types of fibres (e. g. carbon, glass, aramid, basalt, etc.) embedded in a plastic matrix, mostly epoxy, new composites have been introduced; they are characterized {{by the use of}} small high-strength twisted steel wires as resisting elements, combined either with cementitious grouts (SRG) or epoxy (SRP) as matrix. Epoxy resins are widespread as composites matrix and adhesive, however they require special attentions like fireproof and UV protections; moreover, their substantial impermeability might cause compatibility problems, {{especially in the case of}} historical RC structures. Based on these observations, SRG have been developed to combine traditional materials, i. e. cementitious mortars and steel, in order to reach structural performances comparable to FRP materials, and meet additional requirements such as a lower cost, a simpler application and an improved compatibility with the original substrates. However, the structural performance of such strengthening systems strongly relies on the bond between reinforcement and substrate. The present work deals with the bonding performance of both SRP and SRG composites applied to a historical concrete substrate, investigated through pull-off and <b>tangential</b> shear <b>tests.</b> The influence of steel fibres and matrix (organic or inorganic) has been studied by combining two types of steel wires with either epoxy or cementitious mortar.

The transmission of load from one rubbing surface to its mating surface {{under conditions of}} dry contact is taken into account. Microlocal or global models of friction are used to describe this phenomenon. In global approach, frictional force is proportional to normal load. A coefficient of external friction depends on the type, shape, and precision of finishing the surfaces of mating elements. The aim of the paper is analysis of a friction coefficient for 2024 T 3 aluminium alloy during cyclic <b>tangential</b> loading. Experimental <b>tests</b> are carried out on a ball-on-flat wear-testing machine Ducom.

Finally, graphs of temporary friction coefficients versus time {{in the form of}} fluctuated periodical functions are obtained. Two phases of friction are detected. However, during the first stage, the friction coefficient is relatively small while in the second period it rapidly increases and tends to become more irregular. Static and dynamic friction coefficients are estimated. In order to determine the dynamic coefficient the Discrete Fourier Transformation is used. The calculation of the dominant amplitude (corresponding to test frequency) of the studied functions is possible due to this method.

A hammer instrumented with a piezoelectric force sensor was then used to measure the variation of the force as a function of time produced during the impact between the hammer and the ancillary. Then, an indicator I was determined for each impact based on the impact momentum. For each configuration, twelve impacts were realized with the hammer, the value of the maximum amplitude being comprised between 2500 and 4500 N, which allows to determine an averaged value IM of the indicator for each configuration.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} {{investigation of a}} magnetospheric flux transfer event (FTE) seen by the Active Magnetospheric Tracer Explorer (AMPTE) UKS and IRM satellites around 1046 UT on October 28, 1984. This event has been discussed many times previously in the literature and has been cited as support {{for a variety of}} theories of FTE formation. We make use of a model developed to reproduce ion precipitations seen in the cusp ionosphere. The analysis confirms that the FTE is well explained as a brief excursion into an open low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL), as predicted by two theories of magnetospheric FTEs: namely, that they are bulges in the open LLBL due to reconnection rate enhancements or that they are indentations of the magnetopause by magnetosheath pressure increases (but in the presence of ongoing steady reconnection). The indentation of the inner edge of the open LLBL that these two models seek to explain is found to be shallow for this event. The ion model reproduces the continuous evolution of the ion distribution function between the sheath-like population at the event center and the surrounding magnetospheric populations; it also provides an explanation of the high-pressure core of the event as comprising field lines that were reconnected considerably earlier than those that are draped over it to give the event boundary layer. The magnetopause transition parameter is used to isolate a field rotation on the boundaries of the core, which is subjected to the <b>tangential</b> stress balance <b>test.</b> The test identifies this to be a convecting structure, which is neither a rotational discontinuity (RD) nor a contact discontinuity, but could possibly be a slow shock. In addition, evidence for ion reflection off a weak RD on the magnetospheric side of this structure is found. The event structure is consistent in many ways with features predicted for the open LLBL by analytic MHD theories and by MHD and hybrid simulations. The de Hoffman-Teller velocity of the structure is significantly {{different from that of the}} magnetosheath flow, indicating that it is not an indentation caused by a high-pressure pulse in the sheath but is consistent with the motion of newly opened field lines (different from the sheath flow because of the magnetic tension force) deduced from the best fit to the ion data. However, we cannot here rule out the possibility that the sheath flow pattern has changed in the long interval between the two satellites observing the FTE and subsequently emerging into the magnetosheath; thus this test is not conclusive in this particular case. Analysis of the fitted elapsed time since reconnection shows that the core of the event was reconnected in one pulse and the event boundary layer was reconnected in a subsequent pulse. Between these two pulses is a period of very low (but nonzero) reconnection rate, which lasts about 14 mins. Thus the analysis supports, but does not definitively verify, the concept that the FTE is a partial passage into an open LLBL caused by a traveling bulge in that layer produced by a pulse in reconnection rate...|$|R
40|$|In many {{industries}} particulate solids {{are handled}} in different forms. When producing particles breakage {{is an important}} wanted, {{in the case of}} grinding, or unwanted phenomenon. Granules often consist of more than one component and multiple phases. This means that granules are strongly anisotropic and inhomogeneous which makes mechanical characterization difficult, so the strength is difficult to measure. The objective of this thesis is to develop and validate new particle breakage testers from an industrial point of view. The philosophy behind the breakage testers is to isolate the forces that cause damage to the particles. This requires repeated stress cycles to be transfered to the test particles. To validate the improved attrition tester with an industrial application, the damage per unit energy is compared to the damage caused during dilute phase pneumatic conveying. Wear observed during Pneumatic conveying correlates well with results from the improved attrition tester for particles having surface asperities. But only during the so called rounding off phase. The asperities act as a fracture buffer absorbing energy from the impact. First the attrition process removes asperities. Then fracture occurs. Besides the validation of the attrition tester a new breakage tester <b>testing</b> <b>tangential</b> forces is developed in this work. The abrasion tester, is based on a particle box following a planetary motion. This motion causes the particles to rotate continuously over the particle box wall. The particle wear during abrasion testing, expressed in mass loss over transferred kinetic energy is in the same order as during attrition testing. This is explained by the same efficiency at which the kinetic energy is converted into particle deformation. The kinetic energy is converted into newly created surface energy. And the efficiency at which this occurs is a particle property. The major difference between abrasion and attrition testing is the absence of the accelerated removal of surface asperities. A qualitative difference between abrasion and attrition testing is also presented. Abrasion is characterized by the gentle polishing of the particles. Whereas attrition testing results in the removal of the asperities and "craters" are visible of the impact sites of the particle with the wall. Often granules are coated with a water soluble polymeric coating in order to improve the mechanical strength. The question arises what polymeric properties are important to form a mechanically strong coating on a particle? The work of Rowe is cited about the adhesion of the coatings to the particles. Rowe found an inverse relation between coating thickness and film adhesion. Indicating that a thick coating does not necessarily leads to stronger granules. To study the influence of different coating polymers on the overall particle strength, particle formulations are made using fluidised bed coating. The formulated particles are then tested using the developed attrition, abrasion and compression tester. Three attrition sub regimes are identified, the peeling, erosion and layer fatigue modes. The conclusion is that for an elastic deforming brittle polymer, the layer fatigue attrition sub mechanism is expected. Applying a plastic deforming coating leads to a reservoir system where the fragments are held together by the plastic deforming coating. A plastic deforming coating on sodium benzoate shows the erosion mechanism during attrition testing. The coated granules are abrasion tested. A linear relation between remaining mass and transfered energy is observed. During abrasion testing {{it was not possible to}} remove all the coating completely. Apparently the rate of strain in the abrasion tester is not high enough for the coatings to be removed. Applying higher strain rates by increasing the centripetal force could overcome this. At this moment it is mechanically not possible. Also the coated particles are much stronger towards abrasion testing than to attrition testing. This is explained by the perceived thickness of the coating. The compression strength of coated granules is not easy to quantify since there is a large spread in the observed critical stress. This large spread is due to the heterogeneous nature of the granules. Weibull statistics are successfully applied to statistically describe the observed strength of the coated granules. Using Weibull statistics a ranking can be made between the coatings and the compression strength. A plastic deforming coating tends to hold the particle together as a reservoir upon compression. An elastic deforming coating has a higher initial strength without regions of plastic deformation. Individual failure of different layers is observed. This compares also to the layer fatigue attrition mechanism where initially no attrition is observed but after a while the granules start to fail. Chemical engineeringApplied Science...|$|R
