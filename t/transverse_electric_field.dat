50|$|The {{gate oxide}} is the {{dielectric}} layer {{that separates the}} gate terminal of a MOSFET from the underlying source and drain terminals {{as well as the}} conductive channel that connects source and drain when the transistor is turned on. Gate oxide is formed by oxidizing the silicon of the channel to form a thin (5 - 200 nm) insulating layer of silicon dioxide. A conductive gate material is subsequently deposited over the gate oxide to form the transistor. The gate oxide serves as the dielectric layer so that the gate can sustain as high as 1 to 5 MV/cm <b>transverse</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> in order to strongly modulate the conductance of the channel.|$|E

A <b>transverse</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> (a field {{perpendicular}} to the quasi-one-dimensional conducting chains) applied to a charge density wave (CDW) has similarities with a magnetic field applied to a superconductor: both cause frustration in the ordered state and, thus, can induce various intriguing states. We study the equilibrium states of CDW in a <b>transverse</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> employing Ginzburg-Landau type effective free energy of the ordered state.

Although such spin filtering showing giant magnetoresistance was suggested using graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) on both ends of which strong magnetic fields were applied, electric field controlled spin filtering is more interesting due to much easier precise control with much less energy consumption.
