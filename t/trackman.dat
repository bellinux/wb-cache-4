5000|$|A {{platelayer}} (British English) or <b>trackman</b> (American English) is {{a railway}} employee {{whose job is}} to inspect and maintain the permanent way of a railway installation. [...] The term [...] "platelayer" [...] derives from the plates used to build plateways, an early form of railway.|$|E

Inadequate maintenance {{may lead to a}} [...] "slow order" [...] (North American terminology, or Temporary speed restriction in the United Kingdom) being imposed to avoid accidents (see Slow zone). Track maintenance was at one time hard manual labour, requiring teams of labourers, or <b>trackmen</b> (US: gandy dancers; UK: platelayers; Australia: fettlers), who used lining bars to correct irregularities in horizontal alignment (line) of the track, and tamping and jacks to correct vertical irregularities (surface). Currently, maintenance is facilitated by a variety of specialised machines.|$|R
50|$|After the {{war there}} were only paid employees. By 1893, the Richmond and Petersburg {{employed}} ten general officers and 32 men at the stations. Ten enginemen ran the engines on the locomotives, 13 Firemen shoveled coal, six conductors kept the trains on schedule and 19 other men worked on the trains. Five machinists and five carpenters worked in the shop with six other shopmen. Four section foreman, eight other <b>trackmen</b> and 44 flagmen, watchers and switchers worked on the rails. Telegraph operators ran telegraphs that {{went up and down}} the rails and to other lines. Nearly one hundred other laborers were employed.|$|R
50|$|Brotherhood {{groups in}} the United States have been {{prominent}} and widespread {{throughout the history of}} labor organizations. Other important societies include the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, the Brotherhood of Railroad <b>Trackmen,</b> the Switchmen's Union of North America, and the Order of Railroad Telegraphers. These brotherhoods have similar objects which are partly social and educational. Their chief aim is the improvement of the industrial status of their members and the promotion of their economic interests as employees. They arrange wage schedules, and make arrangements about overtime, and they secure both life and disability insurance.|$|R

5000|$|In 1885 {{the first}} Canadian lodge was {{established}} in Moncton, New Brunswick. That year Stephen E. Wilkinson (1850-1901) became the first Grand Master of the Brotherhood, which now had 4,500 members. By 1886 there were 8,000 members in 244 local lodges. Maximum death benefits were raised again, to $800. By 1898 the railways employed over 800,000 workers, 5% of the total labor force in the United States. Brotherhoods organized by craft represented Locomotive Engineers, Conductors, Firemen, <b>Trackmen,</b> Switchmen, Carmen and Telegraphers. The brotherhoods provided social and educational benefits, insurance and relief, and helped resolve disputes between members and employees.Generally, they were very cautious about resorting to strikes.

5000|$|Meanwhile, {{a railway}} <b>trackman</b> named Ashwani Saini, while patrolling along the railway track between Dina Nagar and Jhakholari railway stations, spotted five bombs wired {{to a small}} bridge on the Amritsar-Pathankot line, [...] just before a {{passenger}} train was due to cross the bridge. The train stopped 200 metres from the bombs. The railway authorities suspended all the rail traffic on the section while the bomb-disposal squads defused the bombs.|$|E
50|$|For the 2017 season, the <b>TrackMan</b> {{component}} of Statcast replaced the previous PITCHf/x system for official measurements of pitch speed. As official pitch speed readings are now based on maximum velocity (typically from {{the release of}} the pitch), rather than the speed measured 55 feet from home plate, there have been notable discrepancies in pitch speed reports between those reported in 2016 and 2017, with some pitches registering slightly higher speeds than with the previous system.|$|E
50|$|A radar sits {{aside the}} player to gather launch data. They emmit a {{microwave}} that reflects off any moving object which {{returns to the}} sensor. The system can then record trajectory, launch angle, speed and direction. Additional physics is applied to these figures to calculate spin, axis and tilt. These types of system can be used indoors or outdoors. They are very useful as launch monitors, and they work very effectively. Several professionals make use of them to analyse their game in real environments. Typical examples are available from <b>TrackMan</b> and Flightscope.|$|E
5000|$|Trains mostly hauled coal, {{lumber and}} then grain and tobacco and other farm {{products}} {{as well as}} a little furniture. There was one passenger only train and one train with passengers and cargo which each ran Weekdays and Saturday. [...] The trains had five first class passenger cars for passengers. The trains carried U.S. Postal mail on two mail, freight and express mail cars. The company had 7 engines and 210 cars in 1890, but only five engines in 1896. [...] Postal Telegraph Company operated the telegraph over the rails and charged customers for telegraphs. [...] The railroad company employed 169 people including over 50 <b>trackmen,</b> who maintained the tracks; 18 who worked at the station as well as carpenters, machinists and other laborers.|$|R
60|$|As an {{instance}} of the curious coincidences which often befall the sailor, I must here mention that two countenances before me were familiar. One was that of an old man-of-war's-man, whose acquaintance I had made in Rio de Janeiro, at which place touched the ship in which I sailed from home. The other {{was a young man}} whom, four years previous, I had frequently met in a sailor boarding-house in Liverpool. I remembered parting with him at Prince's Dock Gates, {{in the midst of a}} swarm of police-officers, <b>trackmen,</b> stevedores, beggars, and the like. And here we were again:--years had rolled by, many a league of ocean had been traversed, and we were thrown together under circumstances which almost made me doubt my own existence.|$|R
50|$|Although many {{railways}} in {{the world}} have switched to other methods of inspection, it is still widely used over Indian Railways in addition to other techniques, especially for inspecting railway track and assets like bridges which are situated between stations. The push trolley carries one or more officials inspecting the track and the railside equipment. The official carries instruments to measure and check the condition of the tracks and monitor the work being done by the <b>trackmen,</b> keymen, gatemen etc. who maintain, patrol, man the track and installations. The push trolley is also used by officials inspecting signalling installations in some parts of India. On routes carrying high volumes of traffic, such as the suburban section in Mumbai, push trolleys cannot be used and foot inspections are being resorted to.|$|R
50|$|For the 2017 season, the <b>TrackMan</b> {{component}} of Major League Baseball's Statcast platform {{has replaced the}} previous PITCHf/x system for official measurements of pitch speed. The new system uses a doppler radar to calculate pitch speed based on maximum velocity (typically from {{the release of the}} pitch), rather than the speed measured 55 ft from home plate. The change in data source has led to discrepancies in pitch speed reports between those reported in 2016 and 2017, with some pitches registering slightly higher speeds than with the previous system.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in Dundas County, Ontario, the son of William Black. After leaving the family farm, Black worked as a <b>trackman</b> for the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1892, he married Georgia R. Griffith. Black moved to Parham in 1894, where he {{operated}} a general store {{and worked as a}} contractor. He was also involved in lumbering and contracting in the Temagami region. Black served on the municipal council for Parham and was a justice of the peace and an issuer of marriage licenses. He also served as secretary-treasurer of the Agricultural Society.|$|E
50|$|Railway <b>trackman</b> Tsanko Petrov discovers a {{large amount}} of money in bundles on the tracks, but instead of taking the cash for himself he notifies the authorities. The {{sophisticated}} head of PR at Bulgaria's Ministry of Transport, Julia Staykova, takes the opportunity to deflect a brewing corruption scandal by holding a ceremony to hail Tsanko as a working-class hero. Unkempt and dishevelled with a debilitating stutter, Tsanko is ridiculed by Julia's PR team while they parade him for the press as a hero. In order for the Minister to present Tsanko with a new digital watch, Julia removes Tsanko's own Slava-brand watch, an heirloom passed down from his father.|$|E

[...] The UBRE {{went on strike}} against the CNR on 30 June 1902, with about 220 employees including wipers, switchmen, <b>trackmen,</b> freight handlers, clerks and cleaning staff - almost all the employees other then the conductors, engineers, firemen and brakemen who operated the trains.The CNR brought in strikebreakers, but now {{had to deal with the}} brotherhoods, who had held back from supporting the UBRE but were now threatening to strike.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to convey to the reader a history of men's track and field at La Crosse. The most notable reason for this study is to observe the strides forward that were made by La Crosse track teams and track athletes. A {{significant}} part of the study was the reasons for the established records and performances over the years. The history is composed of three distinct periods. The first, spanned the years from the inception of track in 1911 to 1926, when it appeared to be at its lowest level. The second, begins with 1927 and follows the progress of track to 1942, when it was interrupted due to World War II. The final segment of the paper deals with the modern period of track and field at La Crosse, which began with its reinception in 1946 to the track season of 1967. The paper attempted to delve into the periods and uncover reasons for improvement of the <b>trackmen</b> at La Crosse. Outstanding athletes were mentioned for their performances. Team and individual records were brought out whenever possible. A chronological narrative approach was used in the study with pertinent incidents mentioned whenever they were appropriate...|$|R
