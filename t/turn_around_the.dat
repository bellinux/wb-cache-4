The last man standing was Steven Bradbury from Australia, who was trailing behind at the time, and skated through to win the gold medal, becoming the first person from the southern hemisphere to win a gold medal at a Winter Olympics. Ohno quickly got to his feet and crossed the finish line to win silver with Turcotte winning the bronze. Ohno, coincidentally was wearing skates, made by Bradbury's own boot company, Revolutionary Boot Company. Bradbury had given them to Ohno, expecting for Ohno to win wearing them.|$|E

Holland's disregard for procedures governing the safe operation of the B-52 aircraft that he commanded and the absence of firm and consistent corrective action by his superior officers allowed Holland to believe that he could conduct his flight in an unsafe manner, culminating with the slow, steeply banked, 360° <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> control tower.|$|E

5|$|For Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe Hermann Göring it was {{an ongoing}} concern that {{inadequate}} numbers of fighters were able to continually engage the bomber streams, {{at the very time}} that the USAAF's 8th Air Force's new commander, Maj. Gen. Jimmy Doolittle had instituted a new fighter strategy against the Luftwaffe. Hence on 23 February 1944 — near the midpoint of the USAAF's Big Week bomber offensive against the Luftwaffe, also being carried out by the 15th Air Force flying out of Italian bases — Generalmajor Joseph Schmid Commander of I. Jagdkorps established a new rule for the fighters returning to base. They were to arrive at the nearest designated fighter airfield for resupply instead of returning to their own base. They were to be commanded by the senior pilot landing on that airfield, irrespective of their unit. This was meant to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> fighters in time to intercept returning bombers.|$|E

He guided the club to FA Trophy success in 2009, before {{securing}} promotion to the Football League {{for the first time}} in the club's history in April 2010, finishing the season as league champions. Westley guided the club to back-to-back promotions in his first season as a Football League manager, following Stevenage's successful 2010–11 League Two play-off campaign. At the start of 2012, Westley left Stevenage to join Preston North End. He was sacked by the club in February 2013. A month later, Westley rejoined Stevenage, his third spell at the club. He managed the club for another two years, before leaving again in May 2015. He took charge at Peterborough United four months later, before being sacked shortly before the end of the 2015–16 season. He was appointed manager at Newport County in October 2016, with the club lying bottom of the English Football League, and was sacked five months later after failing to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> club's poor form.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Igor was {{the most}} {{destructive}} tropical cyclone on record to strike the Canadian island of Newfoundland, and the strongest hurricane of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. Igor originated from a broad {{area of low pressure}} that moved off the Cape Verde islands on the west coast of Africa on September6, 2010. Tracking slowly westward, it developed into a tropical depression on September8 and strengthened into a tropical storm shortly thereafter. Higher wind shear temporarily halted intensification over the following days. On September12, explosive intensification took place, and Igor reached Category4 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. By this time, Igor had already begun a prolonged <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> western periphery of the subtropical ridge. Peaking with winds of 155mph (250km/h), the cyclone began to enter an area unfavorable for continued strengthening, and Igor gradually weakened before brushing Bermuda as a minimal hurricane on September20. After turning northeastward, the system began an extratropical transition, which it completed shortly after striking southern Newfoundland. The remnants of Igor were later absorbed by another extratropical cyclone over the Labrador Sea on September23.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{appointment}} of Herbert Chapman in 1925 that Arsenal had their first period of major success; Chapman modernised and reformed the club's practices and tactics, and under him and his successor George Allison (who took over after Chapman's death in January 1934), Arsenal won five First Division titles and two FA Cups in the 1930s. After the Second World War, Tom Whittaker continued the success, leading the club to two First Division titles and an FA Cup. After Whittaker's death Arsenal's fortunes gradually declined; by 1966, they were in mid-table obscurity and had not won a trophy in thirteen years. This led to the dismissal of Billy Wright as manager in 1966, and with it the appointment of Bertie Mee, who would go on to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> club's fortunes.|$|E
5|$|The Muslim force, now {{numbering}} around 700, {{was stationed}} {{on the slopes}} of Uhud, facing Medina with the rear being protected by the towering mount itself. Before the battle, Muhammad had assigned 50 archers on a nearby rocky hill at the West side of the Muslim camp. This was a strategic decision in order to shield the vulnerable flanks of the outnumbered Muslim army; the archers on the hill were to protect the left flank, while the right flank was to be protected by the Mount of Uhud situated {{on the east side of}} the Muslim camp. Protecting the flanks of the Muslim army meant that the Meccan army would not be able to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Muslim camp, and thus the Muslim army wouldn't be surrounded or encircled by the Meccan cavalry, keeping in mind that the Meccan cavalry outnumbered the Muslim cavalry with a 50:1 ratio.|$|E
5|$|The scene {{there was}} chaotic. Large numbers of {{vehicles}} loaded with soldiers were {{moving down the}} road to the rear. Many soldiers on foot were on the road. Champney tried repeatedly but in vain to get these men to stop and <b>turn</b> <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> few North Korean mortar shells falling occasionally in the vicinity did no damage except to cause the troops of the 24th Infantry and intermingled South Koreans to panic further and increase their speed to the rear. The road was so clogged with retreating troops that Check had to delay his counterattack. In the six hours he waited at this point, Check observed that none of the retreating troops of the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 24th Infantry, could be assembled as units. Military police tried in vain to reassemble troops, but they refused even at gunpoint. At 16:00, the 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, assembling {{in the rear of the}} 27th Infantry, could muster only 150 to 200 men.|$|E

5|$|To {{help him}} in tackle the {{numerous}} challenging tasks he faced in Malayan Sugar then, his future wife, Judy Hwang, gave him some notes of her translation of Sun Tzu's Art of War from Chinese to English, as he is not conversant in Chinese. Khoo immediately took keen interest in the military treatise and began to learn and apply Sun Tzu's teachings into his work. Throughout his professional career, Sun Tzu's Art of War was his indispensable guide. Khoo married Judy, a former Taiwanese singer in early 1982. In 1983, he moved to Kuala Lumpur as sales and marketing manager. When Asian sugar baron Robert Kuok was invited to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> ailing Multi-Purpose group of companies in 1987, Khoo joined them as administration manager at Magnum Corporation. In 1989, he left Magnum to head the personnel and administration department of Metroplex Holdings Berhad, where he later became the general manager within just four months, managing The Mall shopping complex. Khoo initiated a series of management and sales policies that enabled The Mall to secure the 'Best Shopping Mall' award {{for two years in}} a row. In the same year, he began writing his first best-seller; War at Work – Applying Sun Tzu's Art of War in Today's Business World, which was a collection of memoranda based on Sun Tzu's Art of War he wrote to his managers at The Mall.|$|E
