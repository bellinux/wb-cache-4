5|$|Andrzej Zahorski {{dedicated}} {{a book to}} {{the discussion}} of Poniatowski, <b>The</b> <b>Dispute</b> <b>over</b> Stanisław August (Spór o Stanisława Augusta, Warsaw, 1988). He notes that the discourse concerning Poniatowski is significantly colored {{by the fact that}} he was the last king of Poland – the king who failed to save the country. This failure, and his prominent position, made him a convenient scapegoat for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish state, but it was too late for that – he only succeeded in damaging his reputation for centuries to come.|$|E

Many in the press believed Wilson was promoting himself to be the Republican presidential candidate. Wilson, however, supported the Civil War hero General Ulysses S. Grant.

Constantine himself disliked the risks to societal stability that religious disputes and controversies brought with them, preferring where possible to establish an orthodoxy. His influence over the early Church councils was to enforce doctrine, root out heresy, and uphold ecclesiastical unity; what proper worship and doctrines and dogma consisted of was for the Church to determine, {{in the hands of the}} participating bishops.|$|E

5|$|In November 1700, Charles II of Spain died childless. <b>The</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> {{who should}} succeed him– the Bourbon Prince Philip of Anjou, {{grandson}} of Louis XIV of France, or the Habsburg Archduke Charles of Austria– soon plunged Europe {{into a major}} war. Louis XIV supported Philip.

In accordance with Charles II's will, Philip was proclaimed king as Philip V of Spain and allied his new kingdom with France. The following February, the War of the Spanish Succession broke out when French forces arrived in the Spanish Netherlands and expelled the Dutch from the barrier towns. In May 1702, England's Queen Anne formally declared war on France.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool Football Club is an English {{association}} {{football club}} based in Liverpool, Merseyside, which competes {{in the top}} tier of English football, for the 2015–16 season. The club was formed in 1892 following a disagreement between the board of Everton and club president John Houlding, who owned the club's ground, Anfield. <b>The</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> rent resulted in Everton leaving Anfield for Goodison Park, which left Houlding with an empty stadium. Not content for his ground to lay idle, he created his own club: Liverpool. Liverpool joined the Lancashire League on their foundation before the 1892–93 season. They ended their inaugural season as league champions, and were elected to The Football League soon afterwards. The club remained in The Football League until 1992, when its First Division was superseded as English football's top level by the newly formed Premier League.|$|E

A new bicameral territorial legislature was created with an upper chamber Council and lower chamber House. These bodies {{met for the first}} time on July 16, 1849, with some members of the provisional legislature continuing into the new government, including David Hill, Asa Lovejoy, Samuel Parker, and Absalom J.

Callixtus declined to support Louis, however, and merely advised the two rulers to seek peace. Amaury de Montfort came to terms with Henry, but Henry and William Clito failed to find a mutually satisfactory compromise. In June 1120, Henry and Louis formally made peace on terms advantageous to the English King: William Adelin gave homage to Louis, and in return Louis confirmed William's rights to the Duchy.|$|E

5|$|According to William of Malmesbury, Æthelstan {{was thirty}} {{years old when he}} came to the throne in 924, which would mean that he was born in about 894. He was the oldest son of Edward the Elder and also the tallest. He was Edward's only son by his first consort, Ecgwynn. Very little is known about Ecgwynn, and she is not named in any pre-Conquest source. Medieval chroniclers gave varying {{descriptions}} of her rank: one described her as an ignoble consort of inferior birth, while others described her birth as noble. Modern historians also disagree about her status. Simon Keynes and Richard Abels believe that leading figures in Wessex were unwilling to accept Æthelstan as king in 924 partly because his mother had been Edward the Elder's concubine. However, Barbara Yorke and Sarah Foot argue that allegations that Æthelstan was illegitimate were a product of <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> the succession, and that there is no reason to doubt that she was Edward's legitimate wife. She may have been related to St Dunstan.|$|E
5|$|Arguments soon {{broke out}} between the Crown and the {{corporation}} over the deal. The Crown argued that the corporation was not adequately maintaining the castle and blockhouses. The Earl of Sussex complained in 1569 {{that they were in}} need of repair, and a 1576 survey stated that their gun platforms were in poor condition and that the ditches had become clogged with earth, while coastal erosion had undermined the South Blockhouse. Queen Elizabeth I provided 300 trees to help the repair work and a new jetty was built to protect {{the southern end of the}} defences from the sea. The Crown gave 60 trees to the town to help with further repairs in 1581. Fears of a Spanish invasion resulted in fresh repairs being carried out, and the threat of the Armada in 1588 resulted in proposals to build additional earthworks around the blockhouses, but nothing appear to have actually been carried out. <b>The</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> maintenance between the Crown and the town finally came to court in 1588; the corporation argued that green timber had been used in the original construction work and claimed that they had spent £2,893 between 1552 and 1587 on the defences: the Crown's case failed.|$|E
5|$|Egan's {{elevation}} to the episcopate worsened {{an existing}} {{conflict in the}} American church: <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> trusteeism. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property and erected the church buildings. The laypeople accordingly demanded some control over {{the administration of the}} parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who, like Egan, held the traditional view of parish organization. The dispute also had nationalist elements to it, as the heavily German parish of Holy Trinity resented the imposition of an Irish bishop instead of one of their own. When Holy Trinity's pastor left for a new assignment in Maryland in 1811, the trustees there were perturbed at Egan's temporary appointment of an Irish priest, Patrick Kenny, to lead the parish, until a German priest could be found (a German priest, Francis Roloff, was assigned the following year).|$|E
