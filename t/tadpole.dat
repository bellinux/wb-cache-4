5|$|Like other amphibians, {{the life}} cycle of a frog {{normally}} starts in water with an egg that hatches into a limbless larva with gills, commonly known as a <b>tadpole.</b> After further growth, during which it develops limbs and lungs, the <b>tadpole</b> undergoes metamorphosis in which its appearance and internal organs are rearranged. After this it is able to leave the water as a miniature, air-breathing frog.|$|E
5|$|In the basement, a pipe blows {{and water}} leaks rapidly from it. Sasha rescues Hawk and Moth, but <b>Tadpole</b> doesn't {{make it out}} of the {{flooding}} basement. That night, a devastated Sasha dreams of Tigerstar and asks if <b>Tadpole</b> is with him. Tigerstar says no, but confides that he is safe. Sasha later meets with Pine, a loner she had previously met, and he takes her and the kits to a barn where another she-cat lives.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{during the}} <b>tadpole</b> stage, {{one of the}} {{developing}} rear legs is eaten by a predator such as a dragonfly nymph. In some cases, the full leg still grows, but in others it does not, although the frog may still live out its normal lifespan with only three limbs. Occasionally, a parasitic flatworm (Ribeiroia ondatrae) digs into the rear of a <b>tadpole,</b> causing a rearrangement of the limb bud cells and the frog develops an extra leg or two.|$|E
40|$|I {{experimentally}} {{investigated the}} habitat use preferences of bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) <b>tadpoles</b> {{of different ages}} (early, first-year vs. late, second-year, premetamorphic) in the laboratory. Early <b>tadpoles</b> showed a preference for non-vegetated areas, whereas late <b>tadpoles</b> showed no preference. Early <b>tadpoles</b> were seen more often over small, gravel substrate as opposed to large rocks, whereas late <b>tadpoles</b> showed no preference. Early <b>tadpoles</b> preferred medium depths, whereas later <b>tadpoles</b> preferred deeper water. Thus, it appears there may be habitat preferences in bullfrog <b>tadpoles,</b> and that these preferences may change over time...|$|R
40|$|The faeces of <b>tadpoles</b> {{frequently}} contain {{cells that}} can inhibit {{the growth of}} other individuals. We examined the mechanism of such cell-mediated interference competition in interactions between <b>tadpoles</b> of Rana temporaria and Bufo calamita. When R. temporaria and B. calamita <b>tadpoles</b> were exposed to cell-laden faeces from larger R. temporaria <b>tadpoles.</b> growth was inhibited relative to controls. <b>Tadpoles</b> of B. calamita remained susceptible to the inhibitory effects of the cells for longer during development than those of R. temporaria. In the presence of excess food, cell production by both species was related to stage of development. <b>Tadpoles</b> raised with cell-laden faeces from R. temporaria <b>tadpoles</b> produced more cells/tadpole/hour than those raised without competitor faeces, and smaller <b>tadpoles</b> were more inhibited than larger <b>tadpoles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{examined}} monthly {{variation in}} the characteristics of river sections along the Río Salado (Puebla, Mexico) and how these factors {{were associated with the}} dis-tribution of the <b>tadpoles</b> of the toad Ollotis occidentalis. <b>Tadpoles</b> were observed in the river in March 2007, and from November 2007 through February 2008 and were only found in the main river channel. Sections of the Río Salado with <b>tadpoles</b> were deeper, wider, and longer than sections without <b>tadpoles.</b> Dissolved oxygen levels were higher and salinity was lower in river sections with <b>tadpoles</b> compared to the sections without <b>tadpoles.</b> There was no difference in temperature between sections with and without <b>tadpoles.</b> <b>Tadpoles</b> were found in river sections that contained more vegeta-tion than river section without <b>tadpoles.</b> Our results suggest that the distribution of <b>tadpoles</b> of O. occidentalis is related to the permanence of water, the chemical nature of the water, and the presence of vegetation...|$|R

5|$|A mutant who is {{friends with}} Bobby and Rogue, Pyro has anti-social tendencies {{because he is}} very angry at the general public for how they treat the mutant community. He {{has the ability to}} control (although not create) fire. He later joins Magneto and Mystique. The filmmakers cast Stanford in the role after they were {{impressed}} with his performance in <b>Tadpole.</b>|$|E
5|$|In fact, tadpoles {{developing}} in ponds and streams are typically herbivorous. Pond tadpoles {{tend to have}} deep bodies, large caudal fins and small mouths; they swim in the quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation. Stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths, shallow bodies and caudal fins; they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of algae and bacteria. They also feed on diatoms, filtered from the water through the gills, and stir up the sediment at bottom of the pond, ingesting edible fragments. They have a relatively long, spiral-shaped gut {{to enable them to}} digest this diet. Some species are carnivorous at the <b>tadpole</b> stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles and fish. Young of the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) can occasionally be cannibalistic, the younger tadpoles attacking a larger, more developed <b>tadpole</b> when it is undergoing metamorphosis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tadpoles</b> {{develop in}} water-filled {{cavities}} on the ground. Males show parental care: they {{remain with the}} eggs and <b>tadpoles.</b> <b>Tadpoles</b> are endotrophic.|$|R

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{examined the}} effects of age and group size on habitat selection and activity level in Xenopus laevis <b>tadpoles.</b> <b>Tadpoles</b> were introduced into an experimental arena at two ages (early and late) and at three group sizes (one, two, and six <b>tadpoles).</b> Group size did not affect habitat selection or activity level. Late <b>tadpoles</b> were more active and used the bottom of the arena more than early <b>tadpoles.</b> Our results suggest that an intrinsic cue (age) is important in determining the behavior of these <b>tadpoles...</b>|$|R
5|$|Sasha {{has gone}} back to the forest to raise her three kits, Hawk, Moth, and <b>Tadpole.</b> While hunting for her kits, she is caught by a ShadowClan patrol. Afraid that they will take her kits, she lies and says they died from the cold. Afterwards, she lets her kits play outside, but when they go back in, she tells them about Ken.|$|E
5|$|Tadpoles {{are highly}} {{vulnerable}} to being eaten by fish, newts, predatory diving beetles, and birds, such as kingfishers. Some tadpoles, {{including those of}} the cane toad (Bufo marinus), are poisonous. The <b>tadpole</b> stage may be as short as a week in explosive breeders or it may last through one or more winters followed by metamorphosis in the spring.|$|E
5|$|Tadpoles are {{typically}} herbivorous, feeding mostly on algae, including diatoms filtered {{from the water}} through the gills. Some species are carnivorous at the <b>tadpole</b> stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles, and fish. The Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) {{is one of a}} number of species in which the tadpoles can be cannibalistic. Tadpoles that develop legs early may be eaten by the others, so late developers may have better long-term survival prospects.|$|E
40|$|This study redescribes the <b>tadpoles</b> of Hyloxalus subpunctatus (Anura: Dendrobatidae) {{based on}} larvae from the type {{locality}} and {{over most of}} its geographic range, including all stages of ontogenetic development. I describe <b>tadpoles</b> in the three developmental phases: (1) back-riding <b>tadpoles,</b> (2) free-swimming <b>tadpoles,</b> (3) froglets or individuals in metamorphosis. The larval morphology showed at least two types of variation: ontogenetic variation and variation within each developmental phase. In back-riding <b>tadpoles,</b> the variation in labial tooth rows suggests a pattern of the labial tooth row formation. In free-swimming <b>tadpoles</b> there is variation in the disposition of marginal papillae, i. e., {{in the number of}} rows on the margin of the lips, but this variation has no effect on the general aspect of the <b>tadpoles.</b> Moreover, I compared the <b>tadpoles</b> of H. subpunctatus with <b>tadpoles</b> of potential sympatric species and populations previously identified as H. subpunctatus. Interspecific differences and larval characters were found that were useful in delimiting those species...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tadpoles</b> of two sister {{species of}} Ameerega are described. <b>Tadpoles</b> of Ameerega parvula can be {{distinguished}} from those of A. bilinguis based on slight differences in their oral disc structure and configuration of the tail fin. Both <b>tadpoles</b> have a tooth row formula 2 / 3 that is typical for many Ameerega, Epipedobates, and Allobates species. The two species differ in the relative length of the second lower tooth row (P- 2). Ameerega parvula <b>tadpoles</b> have a slightly longer P- 2 than P- 1 row, whereas the P- 2 row of A. bilinguis <b>tadpoles</b> is shorter than their P- 1. The upper fin at midtail is slightly wider than the lower fin in A. parvula, whereas the lower fin is slightly wider than the upper fin in A. bilinguis <b>tadpoles.</b> Both <b>tadpoles</b> can be discriminated from those of sympatric species based on color and oral disc morphology. However, the oral disc morphology of Ameerega <b>tadpoles</b> provides no synapomorphic characteristics to distinguish Ameerega <b>tadpoles</b> from other dendrobatoid genera...|$|R
5|$|The <b>tadpoles</b> feed on detritus, algae, and bacteria. <b>Tadpoles</b> in more {{advanced}} phases of development may show {{a preference for}} vegetable matter, but also scavenge or become carnivorous on aquatic life. Captive <b>tadpoles</b> have eaten boiled lettuce and pet food in pellet form. If population density is high, <b>tadpoles</b> have cannibalised one another.|$|R
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the <b>tadpole</b> phase, {{hind legs}} appear, {{followed}} by front limbs, and the phase ends when the front limbs are developed. This normally occurs between October and April due to the breeding season, but tadpoles been observed in the wild throughout the year, suggesting some tadpoles overwinter; this has been seen to occur for captive tadpoles. The length of the <b>tadpole</b> stage, in the wild and in captivity, is usually between 10 and 12 weeks, but can range from five weeks to a year. The slower-growing tadpoles usually progress during winter, as there is a positive correlation between growth rates and temperatures. Variation in growth rate across pH values of 4, 7 and 9 was insignificant. In the first four weeks, there was no significant dependence of the growth rate across the 18–26°C range, but from this point on, growth was significantly hindered at 18°C. At the beginning of the metamorphing stage, all limbs are present and developed, along with a tail. During this phase, the tail is resorbed, and the only other visible change is the spiracle closing. Metamorphing tadpoles typically have a SVL of 22–28mm, and will complete metamorphosis between two and 11 months, depending on the temperature of the water and available food. The process is slowed at low temperatures, but generally takes between three and eight days after the <b>tadpole</b> stage is complete. Breeding occurs in a significantly higher proportion of sites where no predatory fish are present, and water bodies are ephemeral rather than permanent. Populations in Victoria, however, have been recorded as breeding in permanent ponds as readily as they do in ephemeral ponds.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter trojans do not {{maintain}} a fixed separation from Jupiter. They slowly librate around their respective equilibrium points, periodically {{moving closer to}} Jupiter or farther from it. Jupiter trojans generally follow paths called <b>tadpole</b> orbits around the Lagrangian points; the average period of their libration is about 150 years. The amplitude of the libration (along the Jovian orbit) varies from 0.6° to 88°, with the average being about 33°. Simulations show that Jupiter trojans can follow even more complicated trajectories when moving from one Lagrangian point to another—these are called horseshoe orbits (currently no Jupiter Trojan with such an orbit is known).|$|E
5|$|Several hundred frog {{species in}} {{adaptive}} radiations (e.g., Eleutherodactylus, the Pacific Platymantis, the Australo-Papuan microhylids, {{and many other}} tropical frogs), however, do not need any water for breeding in the wild. They reproduce via direct development, an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free-standing water. Almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult, passing through the <b>tadpole</b> stage within the egg. Reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent {{not only on the}} quantity of rainfall, but the seasonal timing.|$|E
40|$|Compensatory {{growth is}} rapid growth {{after a period}} of growth {{depression}}. We studied growth rates of Northern Leopard frog <b>tadpoles</b> (Lithobates pipiens) {{after a period of}} growth depression induced by predation or competition. I predicted that <b>tadpoles</b> in treatments with high competition would have long guts that facilitated compensatory growth. I also predicted that <b>tadpoles</b> exposed to predation would have short guts that would prevent compensatory growth. <b>Tadpoles</b> were reared at low and high density in 410 L mesocosms with and without a caged predator. Each treatment was replicated 5 times. When <b>tadpoles</b> reached 4 cm in length, 3 <b>tadpoles</b> from each treatment were transferred to a new mesocosm with ad libitum food and no predators. They were allowed to grow for one week. Initially, <b>tadpoles</b> reared without predators grew faster, but no <b>tadpoles</b> showed signed of compensatory growth post transfer. Unexpectedly, high competition <b>tadpoles</b> had a greater intake than low competition <b>tadpoles,</b> but grew more slowly. <b>Tadpoles</b> reared without predators had longer tails than those reared with predators, but {{there was no difference in}} gut length between any treatments. Cold temperatures during the first weeks of the study could have affected the results. Nonetheless, larvae did exhibit a high degree of growth-rate plasticity...|$|R
50|$|The small {{pools of}} water are warmed by the sun, which speeds up {{the growth of}} the <b>tadpoles.</b> <b>Tadpoles</b> will eat a variety of foods, such as small insects near the pool and algae, which they scrape off rocks. They also filter {{microorganisms}} from the water as it is passed over their gills. <b>Tadpoles</b> gather in wriggling masses, stir up the muck {{on the bottom of the}} pool, and filter out the organic nutrients. Unlike most <b>tadpoles,</b> which are exclusively herbivores and filter feeders, spadefoot <b>tadpoles</b> are omnivores. They also eat dead insects and <b>tadpoles,</b> as well as fairy shrimp.|$|R
40|$|We {{report an}} unusual example of {{reproductive}} parasitism in amphibians. Dendrobates variabi- lis, an Amazonian poison frog, oviposits {{at the surface}} of the water in small pools in plants and deposits <b>tadpoles</b> within the pools. <b>Tadpoles</b> are highly cannibalistic and consume young <b>tadpoles</b> if they are accessible. Deposition of embryos and <b>tadpoles</b> in the same pool is common. Genetic analyses indicate that <b>tadpoles</b> are fre- quently unrelated to embryos in the same pool. A pool choice experiment in the field demon- strated that males carrying <b>tadpoles</b> prefer to place them in pools with embryos, facilitating reproductive parasitism via cannibalism.

L7 recorded the album as a trio formed by founding members Donita Sparks and Suzi Gardner, and longtime drummer Demetra Plakas, following the departure of bassist Gail Greenwood. It was made with a low budget and produced by the band and their friend Brian Haught.|$|E
5|$|The second {{match was}} a Cruiserweight Open {{match for the}} WWE Cruiserweight Championship. Chavo Guerrero defended the title against Funaki, Jimmy Wang Yang, Shannon Moore and Jamie Noble. Hornswoggle, who wasn't booked {{to be in the}} match, became a part of the match when he entered the ring as the bell rang. All the cruiserweights were out of the ring except Noble. Hornswoggle, who was under the ring for the match, entered and {{surprisingly}} and performed a <b>Tadpole</b> Splash on Noble. Hornswoggle went on to pin Noble to get the victory and win the Cruiserweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{points out}} that all changes of form are {{phenomena}} of growth. He analyses growth curves for man, noting rapid growth before birth {{and again in the}} teens; and then curves for other animals. In plants, growth is often in pulses, as in Spirogyra, peaks at a specific temperature, and below that value roughly doubles every 10 degrees Celsius. Tree growth varies cyclically with season (less strongly in evergreens), preserving a record of historic climates. <b>Tadpole</b> tails regenerate rapidly at first, slowing exponentially.|$|E
40|$|The {{schooling}} {{behavior of}} Hyla semilineata Spix, 1824 <b>tadpoles</b> is described. Experiments {{were carried out}} both in the natural environment and under controlled conditions to quantify the constant movement of these <b>tadpoles.</b> Bullfrog <b>tadpoles</b> (Rana catesbeiana Shaw, 1802), similar in size to the H. semilineata larvae, were used as controls in the experiments. Hyla semilineata <b>tadpoles</b> remained stationary for one sixth {{of the time that}} the bullfrog <b>tadpoles</b> did and the number of individuals of H. semilineata moving at any given moment was about seven times greater. The schooling behavior and constant swimming behavior of these <b>tadpoles</b> may enhance the effect of their warning coloration...|$|R
50|$|Males may {{protect the}} egg clutch. Both {{males and females}} may {{transport}} the <b>tadpoles.</b> Back-riding <b>tadpoles</b> vary in size, from about 10 to 17 mm in total length. Largest free-swimming <b>tadpoles</b> are 38 mm in total length.|$|R
40|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} is commonplace, and plasticity theory {{predicts that}} organ-isms should often evolve mechanisms {{to detect and}} respond to environmental cues that accurately predict future environmental conditions. Here, we test this prediction in <b>tadpoles</b> of spadefoot toads, Spea multiplicata. These <b>tadpoles</b> develop into either an omnivore ecomorph, which is a dietary generalist, or a carnivore ecomorph, which specializes on anostracan shrimp and other tad-poles. We investigated a novel proximate cue – ingestion of Scaphiopus <b>tadpoles</b> – and its propensity to produce carnivores by rearing <b>tadpoles</b> on different diets. We found that diets containing <b>tadpoles</b> from the genus Scaphiopus pro-duced more carnivores than diets without Scaphiopus <b>tadpoles.</b> We discuss why Scaphiopus <b>tadpoles</b> are an excellent food source and why it is therefore advan-tageous for S. multiplicata <b>tadpoles</b> to produce an inducible offense {{that allows them to}} better utilize this resource. In general, such inducible offenses provide an excellent setting for investigating the proximate and evolutionary basis of phenotypic plasticity...|$|R
5|$|Amphibians have a {{juvenile}} stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory {{systems of the}} two are distinct. In the juvenile (or <b>tadpole)</b> stage, the circulation {{is similar to that}} of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.|$|E
5|$|Chavo Guerrero went on {{to defend}} the WWE Cruiserweight Championship in a Cruiserweight Open at The Great American Bash against Jimmy Wang Yang, Jamie Noble, Funaki, and Shannon Moore. Hornswoggle also entered the match at the bell, but {{immediately}} escaped the ring and hid under it. With all of the cruiserweights down, {{with the exception of}} Noble, Hornswoggle came out from under the ring and delivered a <b>Tadpole</b> Splash to Noble. He pinned him afterwards to win the match and the Cruiserweight Championship. Candice Michelle and Melina continued to feud over the WWE Women's Championship. The two had a rematch at The Great American Bash for the title. Michelle pinned Melina after delivering a Candy Wrapper to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{typically}} {{lay their}} eggs in water. The eggs hatch into aquatic larvae called tadpoles that have tails and internal gills. They have highly specialized rasping mouth parts suitable for herbivorous, omnivorous or planktivorous diets. The life cycle is completed when they metamorphose into adults. A few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the <b>tadpole</b> stage. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on fruit. Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. They are an important food source for predators {{and part of the}} food web dynamics of many of the world's ecosystems. The skin is semi-permeable, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs produce a wide range of vocalizations, particularly in their breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviours to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tadpoles</b> of two {{sympatric}} anurans, Bufo gargarizans Cantor, 1842 and Rana zhenhaiensis Ye, Fei & Matsui, 1995, {{were used}} as model organisms {{to examine the effects}} of different levels of tail loss on swimming performance and survival. On average, B. gargarizans <b>tadpoles</b> were shorter and had smaller tails and body mass than R. zhenhaiensis. After 75 % tail loss, the survival rate of experimental and control B. gargarizans <b>tadpoles,</b> and of experimental <b>tadpoles</b> of the two species, differed significantly; the number of <b>tadpoles</b> surviving a complete impairment of their swimming ability did not differ between B. gargarizans and R. zhenhaiensis. After 50 % tail loss, the swimming performance (swimming speed, maximum distance and number of stops) of the two species was significantly affected. However, the adverse influence of tail loss on the swimming speed of B. gargarizans <b>tadpoles</b> was greater compared to R. zhenhaiensis <b>tadpoles.</b> Our data indicates that a 50 % tail loss results in swimming costs for B. gargarizans and R. zhenhaiensis <b>tadpoles,</b> and that 75 % tail loss decreases the survival rate of B. gargarizans <b>tadpoles.</b> Therefore, we conclude that <b>tadpoles</b> of different species and with the same degree of tail loss use distinctive strategies to improve individual fitness in the face of predator pressure...|$|R
