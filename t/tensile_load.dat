25|$|Elastic modulus {{is simply}} {{defined as the}} ratio of stress to strain within the {{proportional}} limit. Physically, it represents the stiffness of a material within the elastic range when tensile or compressive load are applied. It is clinically important because it indicates the selected biomaterial has similar deformable properties with the material {{it is going to}} replace. These force-bearing materials require high elastic modulus with low deflection. As the elastic modulus of material increases fracture resistance decreases. It is desirable that the biomaterial elastic modulus is similar to bone. This is because if it is more than bone elastic modulus then load is born by material only; while the load is bear by bone only if it is less than bone material. The Elastic modulus of a material is generally calculated by bending test because deflection can be easily measured in this case as compared to very small elongation in compressive or <b>tensile</b> <b>load.</b> However, biomaterials (for bone replacement) are usually porous and the sizes of the samples are small. Therefore, nanoindentation test is used to determine the elastic modulus of these materials. This method has high precision and convenient for micro scale samples. Another method of elastic modulus measurement is non-destructive method. It is also clinically very good method because of its simplicity and repeatability since materials are not destroyed.|$|E

However, the behavior of damage evolution in T 700 / 6808 composite when it suffered from <b>tensile</b> <b>loading</b> is seldom researched. In this paper, the acoustic emission (AE) technology is employed to research the process of damage evolution in T 700 / 6808 composite under <b>tensile</b> <b>loading.</b> Results show that the damage in T 700 / 6808 composite is small in the initial stage of <b>tensile</b> <b>loading,</b> and main damage is the matrix cracking. The composite has serious damage in the middle stage of <b>tensile</b> <b>loading,</b> which mainly includes the matrix cracking and the interface damage {{as well as the}} fiber breakage. The number of fiber breakages decreases rapidly in the later stage of <b>tensile</b> <b>loading.</b> When it comes into the stage of load holding, the composite has relatively smaller damage than that in the stage of <b>tensile</b> <b>loading,</b> and the fiber breakage rarely occurs in the composite. Analysis of damage modes shows that the criticality of the matrix cracking and the interface damage is higher than the fiber breakage, which illustrates that the reliability of T 700 / 6808 composite could be improved by the optimization of matrix and interface...|$|R

40|$|The {{strain-induced}} martensitic {{transformation in}} a metastable {{austenitic stainless steel}} is investigated by high-energy x-ray diffraction and material modeling. Two different deformation modes are used (cold rolling and uniaxial <b>tensile</b> <b>loading)</b> and {{the effect on the}} strain-induced martensitic transformation behavior is investigated. Moreover, three different strain rates during the uniaxial <b>tensile</b> <b>loading</b> are evaluated. The results show a sigmoidal transformation behavior of the strain-induced martensite in respect to true strain, for <b>tensile</b> <b>loading.</b> The effect of different strain rates is also clearly seen and it alters both the amount of transformed martensite and the transformation behavior. The martensite transformation is drastically decreased already at moderate strain rates such as 10 - 2 s- 1, due to adiabatic heating of the sample.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe cell morphology, gene expression, and matrix {{synthesis}} of articular chondrocytes {{are known to}} vary with depth from the tissue surface. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate if chondrocytes from different zones respond to in vitro oscillatory <b>tensile</b> <b>loading</b> in distinct ways and whether tensile strain, which is most prevalent near the articular surface, would preferentially stimulate superficial zone chondrocytes. DesignChondrocytes were separately isolated from the superficial, middle, and deep zones of articular cartilage and seeded into three-dimensional fibrin hydrogel constructs. An intermittent protocol of oscillatory <b>tensile</b> <b>loading</b> was applied for 3 days, and the effects on extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis were assessed by measuring the incorporation of radiolabed precursors, size exclusion gel chromatography, and western blotting. ResultsTensile loading was found to be a potent stimulus for proteoglycan synthesis only in superficial zone chondrocytes. Although overall biosynthesis rates by deep zone chondrocytes were unaffected by <b>tensile</b> <b>loading,</b> the molecular characteristics of proteins and proteoglycans released to the culture medium were significantly altered so as to resemble those of superficial zone chondrocytes. ConclusionsOscillatory <b>tensile</b> <b>loading</b> differentially affected subpopulations of articular chondrocytes in three-dimensional fibrin hydrogel constructs. Cells isolated from deeper regions of the tissue developed some characteristics of superficial zone chondrocytes after exposure to <b>tensile</b> <b>loading,</b> which may indicate an adaptive response to the new mechanical environment. Understanding how exogenous mechanical stimuli can differentially influence chondrocytes from distinct tissue zones will yield important insights into mechanobiological processes involved in cartilage tissue development, maintenance, disease, and repair...|$|R

The autogenous ability of bond cracks along rebar was evaluated using the air permeability test.
