500|$|Greene {{and middle}} linebacker Jack Lambert became the {{emotional}} leaders of Pittsburgh's defensive squad. Greene {{was described as}} a huge presence {{both on and off the}} field. Once, in the locker room, a teammate was loudly voicing his discontent over the long and cold practice they had just gone through as he yanked off his equipment. At a nearby locker, Greene lifted his head and silently glared at him. [...] "Believe me, that's all Joe did, he never even said anything," [...] Joe Gordon of the Steelers front office recalled. [...] "I don't think the other players saw Joe glare at him. I think the other player just felt it, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down and never said another word." [...] A natural leader, Greene was named the captain of the defense in 1977. His leadership was also channeled to the offense; Lynn Swann, a wide receiver, considered Greene a mentor. [...] "If you were giving less than 100 percent, he let you know one way or the other," [...] said Swann.|$|E

He devoted his body and his soul to the people. All day he would sit tending to their affairs, and when night came he would sit up while {{business}} remained. One evening when he had finished everything, he called for his lamp - from which he used to buy the oil from his own money - and prayed two prostrations. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> back on his folded legs, with his chin in his hands, and the tears ran down from his cheeks, and this didn't stop until dawn, when he rose for a day of fasting.|$|E
2500|$|David Bowie, {{a fan of}} the band, then {{offered them}} a song he had just written. As Hunter {{recalled}} in a 2004 DVD interview, [...] "He offered us [...] "Suffragette City", which I didn't think was good enough. And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down on the floor, Regent Street it was, in a publisher's office, and plays 'All The Young Dudes' on an acoustic guitar." [...] It reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart, and revived the band, who were appreciative of Bowie's rescue. Guitarist Ralphs relates that Bowie taught Mott studio tricks, but one of the best-known sounds during the period was a 'hand-clap-in-the-toilet' routine that relied more on Hunter's vision than it did on Bowie's clearly more experienced studio abilities. Bowie guitarist Mick Ronson also significantly contributed to Mott's sound, a fact noticed by Hunter, who would later collaborate with Ronson a great deal.|$|E

6000|$|... "Old Sam {{walked over}} to the door and shut it; <b>then</b> <b>’e</b> <b>sat</b> down on the bed and spoke low so that Ginger could hardly ’ear ’im.|$|R
60|$|He {{woke up with}} {{a shiver}} and began to groan and <b>then</b> <b>'e</b> <b>sat</b> up in his bunk and saw old Bill leaning out and staring at 'im.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} Rand-Brown looked vicious. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> {{down with a}} laugh.|$|E
60|$|Umslopogaas {{stared at}} me and laying his hand upon the great axe, half rose. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down again.|$|E
60|$|He limped downstairs just as Mary Ann {{was going}} into the dining-room for prayers, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down to breakfast.|$|E
60|$|He put his 'and {{in under}} the bed-clo'es and felt {{all up and down}} Sam's back, very careful. Sam stood it for 'arf a minute, and <b>then</b> <b>'e</b> <b>sat</b> up in bed and behaved more like a {{windmill}} than a man.|$|R
60|$|Sam didn't answer 'em; he shut up 'is {{knife with}} a click and <b>then</b> <b>'e</b> <b>sat</b> {{at the foot}} o' the bed on Ginger's feet and looked at 'em. It wasn't the fust time they'd been rude to 'im, but as a rule he'd 'ad {{to put up with}} it. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> and listened while Ginger swore 'imself faint.|$|R
60|$|Sam didn’t answer ’em; he shut up ’is {{knife with}} a click and <b>then</b> <b>’e</b> <b>sat</b> {{at the foot}} o’ the bed on Ginger’s feet and looked at ’em.

60|$|He {{looked about}} him rather helplessly. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down beside Melville and demanded a cigarette. Suddenly he plunged into intimacy.|$|E
60|$|Jack merely {{bowed and}} <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down and ate his breakfast. While {{he was doing}} so, Pepper leaned over to him.|$|E
60|$|Lord Marshmoreton {{gave one}} wistful glance {{through the open}} window. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down with a sigh, and felt for his reading-glasses.|$|E
6000|$|... "All the chaps, except Job, that is, {{laughed at}} that; but Job ’e {{got up and}} punched the table, and asked whether there was anybody as {{would like to go}} outside with him for five minutes. <b>Then</b> <b>’e</b> <b>sat</b> down agin, and said ’ard things agin the drink, which ’ad made ’im the larfing-stock of all the fools in Claybury.|$|R
60|$|Five minutes arterwards {{the door}} opened and Henery Walker came {{staggering}} in. He was as white as a sheet, his 'at was knocked on one side of his 'ead, and there was two or three nasty-looking scratches on 'is cheek. He came straight to Bill Chambers's mug--wot 'ad just been filled--and emptied it, and <b>then</b> <b>'e</b> <b>sat</b> down on a seat gasping for breath.|$|R
60|$|Bob Pretty {{scratched}} 'is 'ead {{and looked}} at 'im {{out of the corner}} of 'is eye, but he 'adn't got any answer. <b>Then</b> <b>'e</b> <b>sat</b> biting his finger-nails and thinking while the keepers stood argyfying as to who should take 'is clothes off and go into the pond arter the pheasants. It was a very cold night and the pond was pretty deep in places, and none of 'em seemed anxious.|$|R
60|$|She {{put down}} her book and left, the mate {{watching}} her until she disappeared down the companion-way. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down and waited.|$|E
60|$|For {{several minutes}} he {{remained}} quiet, trying {{to collect his}} thoughts. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> up and passed one hand slowly over his forehead.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wilks, still dazed, muttered that he {{was very}} well. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> bolt upright in his chair and eyed his visitor suspiciously.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{blackness}} of his fault will not excuse mine." [...] And <b>then</b> again <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> silent, hiding his eyes, while his wife, sitting by him, held his hand.|$|R
50|$|He {{retired as}} Lord President in May 2015. Since <b>then</b> <b>he</b> has <b>sat</b> on {{occasion}} as an acting {{judge of the}} United Kingdom Supreme Court.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then Henery Walker see it. We {{was sitting}} inside ’ere with scythes, and pitchforks, and such-like things handy, {{when we see}} ’im come in without ’is hat. His eyes were staring and ’is hair was all rumpled. He called for a pot o’ ale and drank it nearly off, and <b>then</b> <b>’e</b> <b>sat</b> gasping and ’olding the mug between ’is legs and shaking ’is ’ead at the floor till {{everybody}} ’ad left off talking to look at ’im.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> {{down beside}} me, {{and took my}} hand in his, and with very gentle words began to reason and argue with me.|$|E
60|$|Johnny Chuck {{opened his}} eyes. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> up and rubbed them. For just a few, few minutes he couldn't {{remember}} {{where he was}} at all.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> {{himself down}} {{on the grass and}} began to examine his arrows one by one, to all {{appearance}} taking no heed of anything else.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{all went}} off ’ome {{with their arms}} round each other’s necks, but arter a time Ginger found that Sam’s neck wasn’t there, an’ ’e stopped and spoke serious to Peter about it. Peter said ’e couldn’t account for it, an’ ’e had such a job to get Ginger ’ome that ’e thought they would never ha’ got there. He got ’im to bed at last an’ <b>then</b> <b>’e</b> <b>sat</b> down and fell asleep waiting for Sam.|$|R
60|$|With a groan {{the injured}} man {{turned on his}} side. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> slowly <b>sat</b> up and passed his wet hand over his face. Finally, he {{staggered}} to his feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, oh!" [...] moaned {{the young}} man who had been so close to drowning. And <b>then</b> as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> up and stared at the brothers, he added: [...] "Did-- did you sa-- save me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> {{down and}} took a pen to write to Mr. Crosse. [...] "Harold Alison wishes to give thanks to Almighty God for a great mercy." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nicolaes Beresteyn now {{took the}} other chair {{and brought it}} close to his interlocutor. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down and sinking his voice to a whisper he began: ...|$|E
60|$|Now Eric {{sprang up}} with an oath and grasped the hilt of Whitefire. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down again upon the stone and covered {{his face with his}} hands.|$|E
60|$|Ned {{changed his}} clothes and had some breakfast, and <b>then</b> as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> by the fire the feeling of warmth and comfort after his long and cold night {{overpowered}} him, and he went fast to sleep.|$|R
60|$|Giuseppi ceased rowing, and, {{throwing}} {{himself down}} {{at the bottom of the}} gondola, began to sob violently, with the abandonment to his emotions common to his race. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> suddenly <b>sat</b> up.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>then</b> <b>sat</b> down amid {{a murmur}} of mingled applause and disapprobation.|$|R
