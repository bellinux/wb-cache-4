5|$|Computer systems {{make use}} of caches—small and fast {{memories}} located close to the processor which store temporary copies of memory values (nearby in both the physical and logical sense). Parallel computer systems have difficulties with caches that may store the same value {{in more than one}} location, with the possibility of incorrect program execution. These computers require a cache coherency system, which keeps <b>track</b> <b>of</b> cached values and strategically purges them, thus ensuring correct program execution. Bus snooping {{is one of the most}} common methods for keeping <b>track</b> <b>of</b> which values are being accessed (and thus should be purged). Designing large, high-performance cache coherence systems is a very difficult problem in computer architecture. As a result, shared memory computer architectures do not scale as well as distributed memory systems do.|$|E

40|$|EthoVision, a {{computerised}} {{video tracking}} system {{was used to}} monitor the behaviour of females of an aphidophagous coccinellid Cycloneda limbifer Say. Time spent on, and distance walked within 30 minutes, were recorded on simultaneously provided clean substrates and substrates with fresh <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> conspecific or heterospecific first instar larvae. Females spent longer and walked a greater distance on substrates with fresh <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> conspecific larvae than on clean substrates. In contrast, females of C. limbifer spent less time and walked a shorter distance on substrates with fresh <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> larvae of the coccinellid Ceratomegilla (Semiadalia) undecimnotata (Schneider) than on clean substrates. During the middle period (10 - 20 minutes) of the tests, the speed of movement of C. limbifer females was significantly lower on substrates with conspecific larval tracks, and significantly higher on substrates with <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> C. undecimnotata larvae than on clean substrates. Previous results show a strong intra-and interspecific oviposition-deterring effect <b>of</b> fresh larval <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> these coccinellid species on C. limbifer. Results presented paradoxically indicate that the <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> conspecific larvae significantly increase the time C. limbifer spent on a substrate, while those of C. undecimnotata larvae decrease it...|$|R
