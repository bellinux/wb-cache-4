5|$|The ears {{of river}} {{dolphins}} have specific adaptations to their aquatic environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In river dolphins, and other cetaceans, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, river dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allows for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows river dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation. They are so dependent on echolocation that they can survive {{even if they are}} blind. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood. The small hairs on the rostrum of the Amazon river dolphin are believed to function as a <b>tactile</b> <b>sense,</b> possibly to compensate for their poor eyesight.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of <b>tactile</b> <b>sensing</b> in robotics. This chapter is an attempt to answer three basic questions: • What is meant by <b>Tactile</b> <b>Sensing?</b> • Why <b>Tactile</b> <b>Sensing</b> is important? • How <b>Tactile</b> <b>Sensing</b> is achieved? The chapter is organized to sequentially provide the answers to above basic questions. <b>Tactile</b> <b>sensing</b> has often been considered as force sensing, which is not wholly true. In order to clarify such misconceptions about <b>tactile</b> <b>sensing,</b> it is defined in section 2. Why tactile section is important for robotics and what parameters are needed to be measured by tactile sensors to successfully perform various tasks, are discussed in section 3. An overview of `How <b>tactile</b> <b>sensing</b> has been achieved’ is given in section 4, where a number of technologies and transduction methods, that have been used to improve the <b>tactile</b> <b>sensing</b> capability of robotic devices, are discussed. Lack of any tactile analog to Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) or Charge Coupled Devices (CCD) optical arrays has often been cited as {{one of the reasons for}} the slow development of <b>tactile</b> <b>sensing</b> vis-à-vis other sense modalities like vision sensing. Our own contribution – development of <b>tactile</b> <b>sensing</b> arrays using piezoelectric polymers and involving silicon micromachining - is an attempt in the direction of achieving tactile analog of CMOS optical arrays. The first phase implementation of these <b>tactile</b> <b>sensing</b> arrays is discussed in section 5.

Through the stanzas there is a progression from early autumn to mid autumn and then to the heralding of winter. Parallel to this, the poem depicts the day turning from morning to afternoon and into dusk. These progressions are joined with a shift from the <b>tactile</b> <b>sense</b> to that of sight and then of sound, creating a three-part symmetry which is not present in Keats's other odes.|$|E

6000|$|It {{is one of}} the {{peculiarities of}} a really sound {{argument}} that it is susceptible of the fullest development; and that it sometimes leads to conclusions unexpected by those who employ it. To my mind, it is impossible to refuse to follow Dr. Newman when he extends his reasoning from the miracles of the patristic and mediæval ages backward in time as far as miracles are recorded. But, if the rules of logic are valid, I feel compelled to extend the argument forward to the alleged Roman miracles of the present day, which Dr. Newman might not have admitted, but which Cardinal Newman may hardly reject. Beyond question, there is as good, or perhaps better, evidence for the miracles worked by our Lady of Lourdes, as there is for the floating of Elisha's axe, {477} or the speaking of Balaam's ass. But we must go still further; there is a modern system of thaumaturgy and demonology which is just as well certified as the ancient.[133] Veracious, excellent, sometimes learned and acute persons, even philosophers of no mean pretensions, testify to the [...] "levitation" [...] of bodies much heavier than Elisha's axe; to the existence of [...] "spirits" [...] who, to the mere <b>tactile</b> <b>sense,</b> have been indistinguishable from flesh and blood, and, occasionally, have wrestled with all the vigour of Jacob's opponent; yet, further, to the speech, in the language of raps, of spiritual beings, whose discourses, in point of coherence and value, are far inferior to that of Balaam's humble but sagacious steed. I have not the smallest doubt that, if these were persecuting times, there is many {478} a worthy [...] "spiritualist" [...] who would cheerfully go to the stake in support of his pneumatological faith, and furnish evidence, after Paley's own heart, in proof of the truth of his doctrines. Not a few modern divines, doubtless struck by the impossibility of refusing the spiritualist evidence, if the ecclesiastical evidence is accepted, and deprived of any à priori objection by their implicit belief in Christian Demonology, show themselves ready to take poor Sludge seriously, and to believe that he is possessed by other devils than those of need, greed, and vainglory.|$|E

In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} state of the art in <b>tactile</b> <b>sensing</b> for mechatronics. We define a tactile sensor as a device or system that can measure a given {{property}} of an object or contact event through physical contact between the sensor and the object. We consider any property that can be measured through contact, including the shape of an object, texture, temperature, hardness, moisture content, etc. A comprehensive search of the literature revealed that there was a significant increase in publications on <b>tactile</b> <b>sensing</b> from 1991 onwards. Considerable effort in the 1980 s was spent investigating transduction techniques and developing new sensors, whilst emphasis in more recent research has focused on experiments using tactile sensors to perform a variety of tasks. This paper reports on progress in <b>tactile</b> <b>sensing</b> in the following areas: cutaneous sensors, sensing fingers, soft materials, industrial robot grippers, multifingered hands, probes and whiskers, analysis of sensing devices, haptic perception, processing sensory data and new application areas. We conclude that the predominant choice of transduction method is piezoelectric, with arrays using resistive or capacitive sensing.
