Clarke provided two of the team's highest finishes in the later-season single day races, coming fifth at the Coppa Ugo Agostoni and seventh at Vattenfall Cyclassics.

5|$|On June 3, 2013, BFDF <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> over 16,000 {{signatures}} petitioning {{to recall}} Morse to the Colorado Secretary of State, Republican Scott Gessler, of which only 7,178 {{needed to be}} certified in order to force a recall election. In addition, over 13,000 signatures were <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> to recall Giron, of which 11,285 needed to be certified. Efforts to recall McLachlan failed, collecting only about 8,500 signatures of the 10,587 needed. Likewise, the efforts to recall Hudak also failed, falling short of the 18,962 signatures needed.|$|E

5|$|After facing {{criticism}} {{for a lack}} of production in the first two weeks, Smith <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> a record-setting performance against the St. Louis Rams in Week 3. In the first quarter, he scored on each of his first three career receptions with 74-, 41-, and 18-yard touchdowns. The 74-yard score was the longest completion of quarterback Joe Flacco's career. He became the first NFL rookie, and only the twelfth player, to amass three touchdown receptions in a single quarter. Smith finished the game with five receptions for 152yards in the 37–7 victory. It remains a Ravens rookie record, as does Smith's 30.4 yards per catch that day.|$|E
5|$|Alex Cox {{had tried}} to make a Mars Attacks film in the 1980s before Burton and Gems began {{development}} in 1993. When Gems <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> his first draft in 1994, Warner Bros. commissioned rewrites from Gems, Burton, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski in an attempt to lower the budget to $60 million. The final production budget came to $80 million, while Warner Bros. spent another $20 million on the Mars Attacks! marketing campaign. Filming took place from February to November 1996. The film was shot in California, Nevada, Kansas, Arizona and Argentina. The soundtrack became famous for the Martians' quirky speech pattern, which was created by reversing the sound of a duck's quack.|$|E
5|$|All intersections found {{along the}} route are grade separated, except for a single {{at-grade}} intersection currently regulated by traffic lights; a new route is planned to bypass this intersection. As of June 2012, there were tenexits and twoservice areas {{along the route}}. The motorway is currently toll-free except for the Učka Tunnel and the Kanfanar-Rogovići section. However, most of the motorway is potentially a toll road using a ticket system, with each exit including a toll plaza except those of Veprinac, Opatija, and Matulji.

Young <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> order to thwart the manoeuvre and fired two rapid broadsides into Thetis, which responded in kind.

5|$|Before 1920 if {{one player}} {{approached}} another player {{to throw a}} contest, {{there was a very}} good chance he would not be informed upon.

Without the forbidding example of Buck Weaver to haunt them, it is unlikely Mann and Sand would have snitched on their fellow players. After Landis' unforgiving treatment of the popular and basically honest Weaver they dared not to. And once prospectively crooked players knew that honest players would no longer shield them, the scandals stopped.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the recall}} process, Republican George Rivera {{announced}} his candidacy for Giron's senate seat.

Rivera had to turn in a petition with 1,000 signatures in order to qualify to be on the ballot and <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> 1,500 signatures on July 26. Sonia Negrete Winn, a Democrat, also sought to be on the ballot to replace Giron, but failed to obtain the required signatures to be a candidate. In Morse's district, Republican Bernie Herpin announced his interest in replacing Morse and submitted sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBacteriorhodopsin {{is one of}} {{very few}} transmembrane {{proteins}} for which high resolution structures have been solved. The structure shows a bundle of seven helices connected by six <b>turns.</b> Some <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> proteins are stabilized by short range interactions and can behave as small domains. These observations suggest that peptides containing the sequence of the <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> a membrane protein such as bacteriorhodopsin may form stable <b>turn</b> structures <b>in</b> solution. To test this hypothesis, we determined the solution structure of three peptides each containing the sequence {{of one of the}} <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> bacteriorhodopsin.

5|$|Hipper {{set sail}} on 15 December for another raid and {{successfully}} bombarded several English towns, but British destroyers escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet {{in the early}} morning and fought an inconclusive action with them. Communications failures meant that Beatty was not notified of this encounter for several hours afterwards, but he <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> pursuit of the German ships once he learned of their presence. The lead British ships were closing in on the Germans when Beatty learned that Scarborough was being shelled later that morning and he turned west to intercept the other German force.|$|E
5|$|However, {{military}} movements by imperial forces, partisan {{violence in}} Edo, and an imperial decree promoted by Satsuma and Chōshū abolishing {{the house of}} Tokugawa led Yoshinobu to launch a military campaign to seize the emperor's court in Kyoto. The military tide rapidly <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> favor of the smaller but relatively modernized imperial faction, and {{after a series of}} battles culminating in the surrender of Edo, Yoshinobu personally surrendered. Those loyal to the Tokugawa retreated to northern Honshū and later to Hokkaidō, where they founded the Ezo republic. Defeat at the Battle of Hakodate broke this last holdout and left the imperial rule supreme throughout the whole of Japan, completing the military phase of the Meiji Restoration.|$|E
