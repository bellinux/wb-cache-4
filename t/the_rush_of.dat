5|$|In casting Glee, Murphy {{sought out}} actors who could {{identify}} with <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, {{where he found}} Matthew Morrison, who had previously starred on stage in Hairspray and The Light in the Piazza; Lea Michele, who starred in Spring Awakening; and Jenna Ushkowitz, {{who had been in}} the Broadway revival of The King and I.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} 20 years of settlement, {{there was only}} limited contact between the {{settlers}} and Aboriginal people. Joseph Franklin purchased land in the Brindabellas in 1849 and attempted {{to set up a}} cattle farm. His livestock were slaughtered by the local Aboriginal people and he was driven back out of the mountains. <b>The</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> prospectors into the Kiandra area through the Brindabellas and the mountains {{to the west of the}} ACT as a result of the Kiandra goldrush led to conflict with the Aboriginal people. By the time Franklin returned to the Brindabellas in 1863, the indigenous population had been significantly reduced.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Fringe {{division}} is falsely told that their Olivia has escaped. Agent Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), still needing hyperbaric treatment to regrow his skin after being burned, and Agent Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) follow a tracking device on Henry's taxi. When {{they arrive at}} the station, Olivia orders Henry to drive away, and manages to fire at a small valve on a gas tank, allowing the explosion to cover their trail. Walternate, watching the altercation on monitors, notes Olivia has gained the marksmanship ability that the alternate Olivia possesses, and begins to think the serum is working. Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes in a later conversation that <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> adrenaline effectively enhanced the potency of his chemical agents to brainwash Olivia.|$|E

5|$|Terri Schuester {{is portrayed}} by actress Jessalyn Gilsig. Prior to her casting in Glee, Gilsig was an {{established}} actress {{in both the}} television and film industry, but had little theatrical experience. In casting Glee, series creator Ryan Murphy sought actors who could identify with <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> starring in theatrical roles. For the first two seasons of Glee, Gilsig was billed as a contract player for the show. However, {{it was reported that}} Gilsig has been bumped down to a recurring character for the show's third season, set to air in September 2011.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> {{technology}} and the commercialisation of agriculture {{in the second half}} of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks—many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets. There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines, and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians. There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption. The railway network provided critical famine relief, notably reduced the cost of moving goods, and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.|$|E
5|$|The work {{performed}} by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys {{were forced to}} work without gloves {{so that they could}} better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts. Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only {{at the end of the}} working day. Others were caught in <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.|$|E

5|$|While {{president}} of Congress, Hancock {{became involved in}} a long-running controversy with Harvard. As treasurer of the college since 1773, he had been entrusted with the school's financial records and about £15,000 in cash and securities. In <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> events {{at the onset of}} the Revolutionary War, Hancock had been unable to return the money and accounts to Harvard before leaving for Congress. In 1777, a Harvard committee headed by James Bowdoin, Hancock's chief political and social rival in Boston, sent a messenger to Philadelphia to retrieve the money and records. Hancock was offended, but he turned over more than £16,000, though not all of the records, to the college. When Harvard replaced Hancock as treasurer, his ego was bruised, and for years he declined to settle the account or pay the interest on the money he had held, despite pressure put on him by Bowdoin and other political opponents. The issue dragged on until after Hancock's death, when his estate finally paid the college more than £1,000 to resolve the matter.|$|E
5|$|Prospectors George Grimes and Moses Splawn {{were the}} first to {{discover}} gold in the forest at the eponymous Grimes Creek on August 2, 1862. Subsequent gold discoveries at Rocky Bar in 1863 and Atlanta in 1864 increased <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> people to Idaho, and in 1863 Idaho City, with a population of 6,267, surpassed Portland, Oregon as the largest city in the Pacific Northwest. The Idaho gold rush was largely over by 1870, and the population of the Boise Basin fell from 16,000 to 3,500. In 1898 the forest's first gold dredge was built in Placerville and followed by several others. By 1951, when the last dredges shut down, at least 2.3 million ounces (65.2 million grams) of gold had been produced from the Boise Basin area. Silver was mined along the Crooked River from 1882 until 1921, but a silver mine at Silver Mountain proved unsuccessful. Following a shortage of mercury during World War II, mines in the Stibnite area became the country's largest producer of tungsten and second largest source of mercury. The most important known placer deposit of niobium and tantalum in the United States is located in Bear Valley. From 1953 until 1959, dredges there produced $12.5 million ($ today) in niobium, tantalum, and uranium. Other minerals mined in the forest include antimony and molybdenum.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> Republicans {{and other}} conservatives openly {{endorsing}} Barack Obama {{was the subject}} of satire on the television show The Colbert Report on October 29, 2008, which drew record ratings with a self-serving endorsement by the conservative host character played by comedian Stephen Colbert.|$|E

25|$|Coleman {{broke down}} and wept with anger, disbelief and disappointment. As his friends and colleagues tried to assist Coleman from the tribunal's building, the impact of <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> the large waiting crowd hurled Coleman against a traffic signal-box.

60|$|Angut {{was a true}} prophet. When Rooney awoke next morning, {{his ears}} told him that <b>the</b> <b>rushing</b> <b>of</b> ice-cold rivulets through ice-valleys, and the roar of ice-born {{cataracts}} had increased considerably during the hours of darkness.|$|R
60|$|Gently they lowered him, {{but when}} his feet touched the ground {{he was unable to}} stand. His legs doubled under him, and he lay--a little crook-backed heap--upon <b>the</b> <b>rushes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> floor. His senses had deserted him.|$|R

25|$|On the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the fortress engineers were mobilised and moved into their war stations in the coastal defences. In August 1914, TF units were authorised to establish 2nd Line duplicate units to absorb <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> volunteers coming forward. The City of Dundee unit thus formed the 1/1st Dundee Fortress Company, RE, and 2/1st Dundee Fortress Company, RE.|$|E
25|$|Before settlement, {{the area}} where Lethbridge is located was known as The Arid Region. After {{geological}} surveys around 1880 revealed an abundance of coal, it became called The Belly River Coal District. After the Galts introduced irrigation to counter the Arid Region problems around 1900, the locality became called the Irrigated District. Finally, {{as an aid to}} land sales after <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> dryland settlement started about 1905, the non-irrigable portion was called The Winter Wheat Lands.|$|E
25|$|Various {{theories}} have been advanced for {{the causes of}} the difaqane, ranging from ecological factors to competition in the ivory trade. Another theory attributes the epicentre of Zulu violence to the slave trade out of Delgoa Bay in Mozambique situated to the north of Zululand. According to this theory, Portuguese slavers had been driven southwards because of increased naval activity during the Napoleonic wars; it was <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> refugees away from the encroaching slavers that precipitated violent instability in the region.|$|E
60|$|Once Patience, left at home {{watching}} <b>the</b> <b>rushing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stream, {{became so}} frightened that she actually took the children up there, and set Rusha {{to hold the}} baby while she dragged up some sheepskins and some food.|$|R

60|$|There was <b>the</b> river <b>rushing</b> along {{between its}} high, mysterious, romantic banks, which were high as hills, {{and covered with}} vine.

25|$|Entwistle was {{notorious for}} the {{extremely}} high volume {{at which he}} played bass, {{going so far as}} to rig pick-ups to each string on his instruments. This led to him developing hearing loss, similar to Townshend. Although not as public about his problems as Townshend, he reputedly had to rely on lip reading to understand speech in his later years. Randy Bachman of Bachman-Turner Overdrive claimed that towards the end of his life, Entwistle mostly played by feeling <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> air from his giant amp stacks.|$|E
25|$|Working {{six hours}} a day the scribe {{produced}} from two to four pages and required from ten months to a year and a quarter to copy a Bible. The size of the scriptures absorbed the energies of monasteries. Libraries were slowly built up and uniform rules in the care of books were generally adopted in the 13th century. Demands for space led to the standing of books upright on the shelves in the 14th and 15th centuries and to <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> library construction in the 15th century.|$|E
25|$|Coccola's {{work in the}} St. Eugene Mission {{were much}} like what he had {{performed}} in Kamloops and along with his regular duties, his medical services were often required. There were few doctors {{in the region and}} influenza was a common ailment. In October, 1890 a residential school was opened at the mission with 20 students in attendance. Coccola often visited and held Mass at Ainsworth, Kaslo and Nelson where churches and hospitals were being built to fill the demands of <b>the</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> settlers caused by railway construction.|$|E
60|$|He {{then sat}} at the table with Roger Leybourn and his lady, who had {{recovered}} from her swoon, and behind them on <b>the</b> <b>rushes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> floor lay the body of De Fulm in a little pool of blood.|$|R
60|$|She {{was troubled}} in spirit. Hearing <b>the</b> <b>rushing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beck away {{down under the}} trees, she was startled, and {{wondered}} what it was. Walking down, she found the bluebells around her glowing like a presence, among the trees.|$|R
60|$|The gale {{was still}} blowing violently. Many {{of the smaller}} trees bowed their tops, as if ready to descend to the earth, while <b>the</b> <b>rushing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind through the {{branches}} of the groves resembled the roar of distant chariots.|$|R
