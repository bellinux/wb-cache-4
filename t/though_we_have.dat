The ordinary metals have centro-symmetrical crystalline structures whereas the peculiar metals have structures involving directional bonding.

25|$|The first alchemist is {{recognized}} as being Mary the Jewess (c. 200 A.D.). Mary is known for creating a number of improvements to alchemical equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry. Her most well-known advancements are heating and distillation processes. The water-bath, also known as bain-marie {{is said to have}} been invented by or at least improved by her. This double-boiler was often used in chemistry for processes that might require gentle heating. The tribikos (a basic still) and the kerotakis (a more intricate distilling apparatus) are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her. It is also said that Mary was the first individual to discover hydrochloric acid, though this is not accepted by most scientific texts. <b>Though</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no writing from Mary herself, she is known from the fourth century writings of Zosimos of Panopolis.|$|E
25|$|Metzinger {{once did}} {{gorgeous}} mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that {{an effect of}} vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color. Surely, Metzinger should know what such things mean. Picasso never painted a pretty woman, <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> noticed that he likes to associate with them. Czobel sees them through the bars of his cage, and roars out tones of mauve and cinnabar. Derain sees them as cones and prisms, and Braque {{as if they had}} been sawn out of blocks of wood by carpenters’ apprentices. But Metzinger is more tender towards the sex. He arranges them as flowers are arranged on tapestry and wall paper; he simplifies them to mere patterns, and he carries them gently past the frontier of Poster Land to the world of the Ugly so tenderly that they are not much damaged—only more faint, more vegetable, more anaemic.|$|E

500|$|In February 2010, Bernd Schuster {{was asked}} if Raúl did not favour Villa moving to Real Madrid, to which he responded, [...] "I have a cough," [...] which caused many {{to believe that he}} was {{implying}} the rumour to be true. Villa firmly ridiculed that idea by saying, [...] "It is impossible that a player with as much class on and off the pitch as Raúl would speak poorly of me. I have always had a good relationship with Raúl, even <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> hardly met on international duty." [...] Speaking about Raúl's record with the Spanish national team as the nation's leading top scorer, Villa said, [...] "I've got 25 goals but he's got 44 and is still playing. I'd be delighted to reach that tally as I'd help the national team achieve great victories and, in many years' time, I could see my name on a [...] that another young lad was trying to beat. That would be great." [...] On 25 March 2011, two years after making that remark, Villa surpassed Raúl as Spain's all-time top scorer.|$|E
500|$|In July 2011, Lindelof {{said that}} the film would rely upon {{practical}} effects, and would use CGI generally for on-set pre-visualization of external space visuals. Scott said that [...] "you can pretty much do anything you want" [...] with digital technology, and, [...] "Doug Trumbull {{once said to me}} 'If you can do it live, do it live.' That was 29 years ago. Even <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> remarkable digital capabilities I still say do it live. It's cheaper." [...] Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski convinced Scott that {{it would be possible to}} film in 3D with the same ease and efficiency of 2D filming. 3D company 3ality Technica provided some of the rigs and equipment to facilitate 3D filming, and trained the film's crew in their proper operation. According to Scott, the decision to film in 3D added $10 million to the film's budget. Since 3D films need high lighting levels on set, the hallmark dark and shadowy atmosphere of the Alien films was added in post-production using color grading processes, and the 3D equipment was based on post-Avatar technology.|$|E

500|$|Di Grassi {{was handed}} a formal {{reprimand}} by the stewards over the pit stop release that caused Piquet to brake to avoid hitting {{him and was}} fined €1,500. Piquet felt it was not fair for different punishments to exist for the same penalty and was frustrated, complaining of inconsistency from the stewards. He warned drivers would become quickly disenchanted and believed stewards would not be taken seriously in future races. Piquet advocated for more people to observe the track, install more cameras and fit a GPS system in all cars. D'Ambrosio felt aggrieved over the battle between his teammate Duval in the race's closing period, saying the events were [...] "a {{little bit of a}} pity" [...] and was unsure whether it was a misunderstanding. Duval insisted the battle was firm but fair, saying he gave d'Ambrosio room but would make it difficult for anyone to overtake him: [...] "As you have seen in the past <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> had fights {{and most of the time}} I was really gentle, and this weekend I was in this position where I was competitive and I had less energy available so I fought." [...] Dragon's team principal Jay Penske revealed the drivers were allowed to battle each other cleanly but if one of them eliminated the other from contention, that driver would be required to miss the following race.|$|E
500|$|Stigand was {{probably}} the most lavish clerical donor of his period, when great men gave to churches on an unprecedented scale. He was a benefactor to the Abbey of Ely, and gave large gold or silver crucifixes to Ely, St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury, Bury St. Edmunds Abbey, and to his cathedral church at Winchester. The crucifixes given to Ely, Bury and Winchester all appear to have had about life-size figures of Christ with matching figures of the Virgin and John the Evangelist, as is recorded in the monastic histories, and were probably permanently mounted over the altar or elsewhere. These would have been made with thin sheets of precious metal over a wooden core. No comparably early rood crosses with the side figures of Mary and John seem to survive, <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> large painted wooden crucifixes like the German Gero Cross of around 980, and the Volto Santo of Lucca (renewed with a later figure) which is known to have inspired Leofstan, Abbot of Bury (d. 1065) to create a similar figure, perhaps covered in precious metal, on his return from a visit to Rome. To Ely he gave gold and silver vessels for the altar, and a chasuble embroidered in gold [...] "of such inestimable workmanship and worth, that none in the kingdom is considered richer or more valuable". Although it does not appear that Stigand ever travelled to Rome, there are indications that Stigand did go on pilgrimage. A 12th-century life of Saint Willibrord, written at the Abbey of Echternach in what is now Luxembourg, records that [...] "to this place also came Stigand, the eminent archbishop of the English". In the work, Stigand is recorded as giving rich gifts to the abbey as well as relics of saints.|$|E

2500|$|In Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn, Cathy Davidson {{suggests}} that breakthroughs in cognitive science should recalibrate {{our sense of}} what it means to learn. According to Davidson, those of us in higher education are paradoxically obsessed with the implications of living in the [...] "digital age," [...] even <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> “yet to rethink how we need to be organizing our institutions—our schools, our offices—to maximize the opportunities of our digital era” (12). We tend to uphold models of teaching and assessments that no longer serve a generation of students who face a myriad of new challenges, as they attempt to learn to think critically in an era of information overload. Technology in all its forms is playing an increasingly important role in the lives of students. Colleges and universities, therefore, need to pay attention to the impact that the appropriate uses of digital tools can have on extending, enhancing, and enriching the student learning experience, both on and off campus. Moreover, and more importantly, Davidson argues that sustained exposure to such a range of digital media demands a different kind of attention than we previously required.|$|E
2500|$|Known for reinventing {{her style}} and image, Tsai's music and fashion sense are {{noted by the}} media and general public. Although she was modest in {{appearance}} in early years, her image and fashion has changed several times since the release of her fifth studio album, Magic (2003). Around the time of the release of Magic, Japan's Ray magazine named her [...] "Taiwan's trend-setter". However, many critics felt that her style at the time was too similar to those of Japanese singer Ayumi Hamsaki. In a public interview, Tsai spoke about comparisons to Hamasaki: [...] "Fashion is a prevailing trend in the style in which a person dresses, but there is nothing to do with copy; I feel honored to be compared with her, but we are different <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> similar fashion sense." [...] With the beginning of her first concert tour, J1 World Tour (2004–2006), Tsai mostly dismissed her innocent image for a more sexy look. In 2006, Tsai received an MTV Asia Award for the Style Award. At the same time, Yahoo! Taiwan named her the most fashionable artist in Taiwan. Since 2007, Tsai has been invited to watch the [...] "Big Four" [...] fashion weeks, Met Gala, and Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, made her the first Chinese singer that has been officially invited to attend all of these notable fashion events. Described as one of the sexiest woman of her generation, Tsai is considered a sex symbol. In 2006, FHM Taiwan ranked her first on the [...] "100 Sexiest Women in the World" [...] list. She also had appeared in the top ten on the list seven times in the subsequent nine years. In 2016, FHM Taiwan ranked her first on the list again.|$|E
