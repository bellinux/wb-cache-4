50|$|Fishing <b>tackle</b> boxes {{have for}} many years been an {{essential}} part of the anglers equipment. Fishing <b>tackle</b> boxes were originally made of wood or wicker and eventually some metal fishing <b>tackle</b> boxes were manufactured.

Early plastic fishing <b>tackle</b> boxes were similar to tool boxes but soon evolved into the hip roof cantilever <b>tackle</b> boxes with numerous small trays for small <b>tackle.</b> These types of <b>tackle</b> boxes are still available today but they have the disadvantage that small <b>tackle</b> gets mixed up. Fishing <b>tackle</b> boxes have also been manufactured so the drawers themselves become small storage boxes, each with their own lids. This prevents small <b>tackle</b> from mixing, and can turn each drawer into a stand-alone container which can be used to carry small <b>tackle</b> to a rod some distance from the main <b>tackle</b> box.|$|R
