50|$|International law recognizes a {{right of}} self-defence, as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) affirmed in the Nicaragua Case {{on the use of}} force. Some {{commentators}} believe that the effect of Article 51 is only to preserve this right when an armed attack occurs, and that other acts of self-defence are banned by article 2(4). The more widely held opinion is that article 51 acknowledges this general right, and proceeds <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>procedures</b> for the specific situation when an armed attack does occur. Under the latter interpretation, the legitimate use of self-defence in situations when an armed attack has not actually occurred is still permitted. It is also to be noted that not every act of violence will constitute an armed attack. The ICJ has tried to clarify, in the Nicaragua case, what level of force is necessary to qualify as an armed attack.|$|R

40|$|Disaster {{scenarios}} are dismal and often result in mass displacement and migration of people. In eventuality of emergency situations, {{people need to}} be rehabilitated and provided with an adequate supply of drinking water, the most essential natural resource needed for survival, which is often not easily available even during non-disaster periods. In the aftermath of a natural or human-made disaster affecting mankind and livestock, the prime aim is to ensure supply of safe water to reduce the occurrence and spread of water borne disease due to interrupted, poor and polluted water supply. Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) emergencies augment the dilemma as an additional risk of "contamination" is added. The associated risks posed to health and life should be reduced to as low as reasonably achievable. Maintaining a high level of preparedness is the crux of quick relief and efficient response to ensure continuous supply of safe water, enabling survival and sustenance. The underlying objective would be to educate and train the persons concerned <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> the <b>procedures</b> for the detection, cleaning, and treatment, purification including desalination, disinfection, and decontamination of water. The basic information to influence the organization of preparedness and execution of relief measures at all levels while maintaining minimum standards in water management at the place of disaster, are discussed in this article...|$|R
40|$|An {{examination}} of the formulation, interpretation and implementation of central government correspondence addressed in identical terms {{to a number of}} administrative bodies. Circulars are not required to conform to any legal standards regarding their form, content or publication and as a consequence have evolved unsystematically and haphazardly according to changing ideas about central-local relations, reflecting in a flexible manner the overridingly pragmatic style of the departments which issue them. Their initial role of guiding administrative practice while preserving local discretion has been supplemented by a more promotional national policy use. Certain post-war Acts gave important social services functions to local bodies but vested general supervisory duties in the appropriate Minister. Leaving these wide Ministerial responsibilities largely undefined paved the way for detailed policy intervention by the centre. Circulars began to introduce and enforce major policy changes throughout all local authorities. They have also been used to interpret or replace express statutory provisions, to elaborate legislative policy, to sub-delegate statutory powers and <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> codes and <b>procedures</b> having legal effect. Although not deriving from statutory authority, these circulars must properly be regarded as law-making instruments forming a new third tier of legislation below Statutory Instruments. The legislative and judicial branches have lost effective control over these various policy and law-making functions performed by the executive. The constitutional dilemma is how to restore responsibility and democratic accountability without destroying the many practical advantages which circulars offer to central departments. <p...|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the continuously increasing utilization of the sea and the environinental stress on the oceans resulting from it the view held so far of a fundamental differentiation between land and sea can no longer be maintained. In Germany, however, like in most other European states there are separate administrative bodies responsible for coastal and marine management. Traditionally, marine administration is in the responsibility of central institutions (e. g. shipping, navigation, fishing, offshore mining, defense) even if in federal states like Germany certain areas of authority are in the responsibility of the Laender. Due to their exclusively sector-oriented tasks, these institutions -both central or federal- lack the ability to overcome the existing fragmentation in jurisdiction and administration. Given the ubiquitous problem of balancing economic growth and environmental quality in coastal and marine zones, it is obvions that a policy is needed integrating jurisdiction, decision - making and public involvement. The longestablished practice of physical planning on the continent considering not only national but also regional and local interests can also be regarded a suitable tool for coastal zone management. In the light of limited natural resources -both on land and under water- "integrated" precautionary planning and management systems should be established. The basic principle of physical planning, namely the weighing up of the varions claims on all important natural resources, offers great advantages - especially from the aspect of public involvement. Basically, there is no difference in finding out and settling utilization conflicts on the dry and on the watercovered surface of the earth. On the state level, the determination of rights of use of continental and marine resources have to be restricted to the "national" interests (i. e. the Federal Republic of Germany as a whole). At the same time, it is necessary <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> fundamental <b>procedures</b> for the various hiercharchical levels of administration. On the regional level (in Germany the Laender), beside the structuring of spatial development concepts for the coastal and marine zones, emphasis is on the coordination of tasks especially among institutions of subject-related government planning and local authorities. Starting out from the principle that democratic decisions should be made on a level as near as possible to the people affected by them, the biggest potential for conflict -and thus the greatest need for regulation- is to be expected on the local (communal) level. This refers also to the coastal zone and its off-shore area. The article deals with some aspects of and makes some proposals for the "physical planning of the sea" in Germany...|$|R
5000|$|In {{considering}} whether {{the decision of}} an industrial tribunal is perverse in a legal sense, there is one feature which does not occur in other jurisdictions {{where there is a}} right of appeal only on a point of law. The Industrial Tribunal is an industrial jury which brings to its task a knowledge of industrial relations both from the view point of the employer and the employee. Matters of good industrial relations practice are not proved before an industrial tribunal as they would be proved before an ordinary court: the lay members are taken to know them. The lay members of the Industrial Tribunal bring to their task their expertise in a field where conventions and practices are of the greatest importance. Therefore in {{considering whether}} the decision of an industrial tribunal is perverse, it is not safe to rely solely on the common sense and knowledge of those who have no experience in the field of industrial relations. A course of conduct which to those who have no practical experience with industrial relations might appear unfair or unreasonable, to those with specialist knowledge and experience might appear both fair and reasonable: and vice versa.For this reason, it seems to us that the correct approach is to consider whether an industrial tribunal, properly directed in law and properly appreciating what is currently regarded as fair industrial practice, could have reached the decision reached by the majority of this tribunal. We have reached the conclusion that it could not.......the question we have to decide is whether a reasonable tribunal could have reached the conclusion that the dismissal of the applicants in this case lay within the range of conduct which a reasonable employer could have adopted. It is accordingly necessary to try to set down in very general terms what a properly instructed industrial tribunal would know to be the principles which, in current industrial practice, a reasonable employer would be expected to adopt. This is not a matter on which the chairman of this appeal tribunal feels that he can contribute much, since it depends on what industrial practices are currently accepted as being normal and proper. The two lay members of this appeal tribunal hold the view that it would be impossible <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> detailed <b>procedures</b> which all reasonable employers would follow in all circumstances: the fair conduct of dismissals for redundancy must depend on the circumstances of each case. But in their experience, there is a generally accepted view in industrial relations that, in cases where the employees are represented by an independent union recognised by the employer, reasonable employers will seek to act in accordance with the following principles::1. The employer will seek to give as much warning as possible of impending redundancies so as to enable the union and employees who may be affected to take early steps to inform themselves of the relevant facts, consider possible alternative solutions and, _f necessary, find alternative employment in the undertaking or elsewhere.:2. The employer will consult the union as to the best means by which the desired management result can be achieved fairly and with as little hardship to the employees as possible. In particular, the employer will seek to agree with the union the criteria to be applied in selecting the employees to be made redundant. When a selection has been made, the employer will consider with the union whether the selection has been made in accordance with those criteria.:3. Whether or not an agreement as to the criteria to be adopted has been agreed with the union, the employer will seek to establish criteria for selection which so far as possible do not depend solely upon the opinion of the person making the selection but can be objectively checked against such things as attendance record, efficiency at the job, experience, or length of service.:4. The employer will seek to ensure that the selection is made fairly in accordance with these criteria and will consider any representations the union may make as to such selection.:5. The employer will seek to see whether instead of dismissing an employee he could offer him alternative employment.The lay members stress that not all these factors are present in every case since circumstances may prevent one or more of them being given effect <b>to.</b> But the <b>lay</b> members would expect these principles to be departed from only where some good reason is shown to justify such departure. The basic approach is that, in the unfortunate circumstances that necessarily attend redundancies, as much as is reasonably possible should be done to mitigate the impact on the work force and to satisfy them that the selection has been made fairly and {{not on the basis of}} personal whim.|$|R
