5|$|Studies of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> of {{the lake}} in 1983–84 {{indicate}} a decline in quality since the 1965–66 analysis. Scientific research over the years also reveal that Telbal, Botkal, and sewage drains are responsible for a substantial influx of nitrogen and phosphorus into the lake. Quantitatively, fifteen drains and several other sources have released a total of 156.62 tonnes (56.36 tonnes by drains alone) of phosphorus, and 241.18 tonnes of inorganic nitrogen into the lake from a discharge of 11.701 million cubic metres /year. Non-point sources, such as seepage and diffused runoff, also add to this pollution and have been recorded as further adding 4.5 tonnes of total phosphates and 18.14 tonnes of nitrogen (NO3–N and NH4–N) to the lake. Based on the values mentioned above, it has been inferred that <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> {{of the lake}} has deteriorated.|$|E

40|$|The present article {{discusses}} {{and compares}} five different <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> indices, viz arithmetic <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> index, multiplicative <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> index, unweighted arithmetic <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> index, unweighted multiplicative <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> index, and Harkin's <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> index, which were considered for characterizing <b>the</b> coastal <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> at <b>the</b> Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, Bombay, India. Dissolved oxygen, pH, {{biochemical oxygen demand}} (BOD), temperature, suspended solid, and turbidity were used as <b>the</b> parameters of <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> indices. <b>The</b> value function graphs used for above-mentioned variables were developed using harbour <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> standards and aquatic life. The product moment correlation coefficients for various <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> indices were determined using the SPSS software package to evaluate correlation among various indices. It was found that <b>the</b> unweighted arithmetic <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> index was higher than weighted arithmetic <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> index while <b>the</b> multiplicative <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> index was lower than unweighted multiplicative <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> index. All <b>the</b> indices were well correlated with each other except Harkin's <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> index. <b>The</b> Harkin's <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> index was different from other <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> indices. <b>The</b> comparison of different form of indices showed that <b>the</b> multiplicative <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> index was <b>the</b> most suitable <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> index for coastal waters...|$|R

5|$|A 2004-05 EPA {{study of}} the river rated <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> 6 out of 100. The study also {{discovered}} that dissolved oxygen levels in the water were low because there were few organisms, poor sediment, and little plant life in the river. Although storm water from residential neighborhoods added dissolved oxygen, it also brought ammonia from fertilizer. The Army Corps of Engineers found that the channeling prevented aquatic life from sustaining itself; few fish naturally spawn in the river because of the cement casing and flume at its mouth.|$|E
5|$|A {{scientific}} study of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> parameters of physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics and role of phumdis in the Loktak Lake has been conducted by collecting surface water samples on monthly basis from 15 stations, representing 5 zones; northern, western, eastern, middle and southern. The test results indicated that water quality in the phumdi area was poor in {{the northern and southern}} zones of the lake; test results indicated low dissolved oxygen, low pH (normal range for pH in surface water systems is 6.5 to 8.5) high CO2 and high Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) but <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> was good in the open water area. Assessment of the total nitrogen content of the macrophyte species of phumdis indicated that the following were present in descending order: Salvinia natans (1.8%), Zizania latifolia (1.6%), Capillipedium sp. (1.3%), Brachiaria mutica (1.2%), Cyperus brevifolius (1.2%), Echinochloa stagnina (1.0%), Phragmites karka (1.0%) and Hedychium coranarium (0.94%). The test results confirmed the fact that the phumdis were efficient in absorbing nutrients from the lake water. However, they deteriorated water quality due to reduced light penetration and accumulation of organic matter in the lake ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{affecting}} <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> mainly {{consist of}} different types of fecal coliforms, {{with a high level of}} E. coli bacteria. This comes from pet waste, fertilizer, manure, and other organic pollutants that are washed into the creek, raising the average bacteria level 34percent higher than levels declared safe under California law. This in turn affects recreation at popular Aliso Creek Beach at the creek's mouth, violating state swimming standards 99percent of the time, especially during storm events, as beachgoers are warned to avoid the creek for 72hours (3days) after a major storm event.|$|E

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>quality</b> {{modelling}} is <b>the</b> primary tool {{used for}} catchment and stream <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> investigations. <b>The</b> general architecture {{of a typical}} <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> model is <b>the</b> integration of the pollutant processes with the hydrologic and hydraulic approaches. However, {{due to the lack}} of specific local information and poor understanding of the limitations of various estimation techniques and underlying physical parameters, modelling approaches are often subjected to producing gross errors. Most of <b>the</b> available <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> models are too simple and/or stochastic in nature. Many of those models perform <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> estimations in isolation, i. e. separate <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> models for catchment and stream analyses. Isolated models may lead to inconsistencies and biased results in <b>the</b> prediction of <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> parameters. On <b>the</b> other hand, there are some integrated <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> models, which are very complex requiring huge physical and chemical data as well as determining many model parameters. This paper presents the development of a simple, integrated and deterministic catchment-stream <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> model to be able to continuously simulate different <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> parameters. <b>The</b> integrated model is comprised of two individual models: <b>the</b> catchment <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> model and <b>the</b> stream <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> model. <b>The</b> catchment <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> model consists of two sub-models: rainfall-runoff model and pollutant processes model. The rainfall-runoff model was developed by considering the time-area method of runoff routing. The model estimates amount of surface runoff generated from a specified catchment for which rainfall data is provided. <b>Water</b> <b>quality</b> parameters were incorporated with the developed rainfall-runoff model, which represents <b>the</b> catchment <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> model. This model estimates the amount of pollutant accumulated on catchment surfaces during the antecedent dry days, and their transportation with surface runoff into waterways and receiving water bodies throughout storm events. Similar to <b>the</b> catchment <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> model, <b>the</b> stream <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> model comprised of two sub-models: the stream flow model and stream pollutant processes model. The stream flow model was developed by considering the Muskingum-Cunge method of stream routing. The stream flow model estimates <b>the</b> rate of <b>water</b> flow into <b>the</b> downstream sections of a particular stream reach. The processes of <b>the</b> same <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> parameters as used in <b>the</b> catchment <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> model were incorporated with the stream flow model which represents <b>the</b> stream <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> model. Final output of <b>the</b> stream <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> model is <b>the</b> concentration of transported pollutants into different downstream sections of a particular stream reach. Finally, <b>the</b> catchment <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> model and <b>the</b> stream <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> model were integrated for the continuous simulation of previously mentioned <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> parameters. For calibration and validation of the model, different published data and reliable source data collected by the Gold Coast City Council (GCCC) were used. Calibration of <b>the</b> catchment <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> model and stream <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> model was performed separately.

30|$|The {{models can}} be {{considered}} as process and inverse process of coagulation. In general, a process model is used to predict <b>the</b> treated <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> by process inputs, such as raw <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> and coagulant dosage. This model can be used to determine coagulant dosage by trial and error and can be used to understand factors which affect the process for process analysis and for new operators’ training (Baxter et al. 2001 b). In addition, the process model can be used to assess in real time the adequacy of coagulant dosage based on the operator’s experience. Thus, the model can contribute to ensure the stability of operation. On the contrary, an inverse process model is used to predict coagulant dosage using <b>the</b> treated <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> and <b>the</b> raw <b>water</b> <b>quality.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> inverse process model can be used to predict directly the optimal coagulant dosage based on <b>the</b> raw <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> and <b>the</b> desired treated <b>water</b> <b>quality.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> of the Little Applegate River {{watershed}} {{is generally}} poor {{due to high}} temperatures, sedimentation, and oxygen saturation levels which occur throughout the region.

Hydraulic mining near Sterlingville devastated the surrounding landscape, leaving the slopes bare and sending rocks and gravel downstream. Cattle and sheep were introduced to the area in the late 19th century; they have since overgrazed some areas of the watershed, reducing native grasses and allowing noxious weeds to spread. Overgrazing also contributes to soil erosion. Large amounts of water is diverted from the river and its tributaries, sometimes {{to such an extent that}} the mouth is left nearly dry.|$|E

5|$|Mining in the creek's {{watershed}} {{began in}} 1844. A number of mining villages {{existed in the}} Tangascootack Creek watershed between 1845 and 1870. In the mid-1850s the Farrandsville Iron Company purchased large amounts of land in several places, including along Tangascootack Creek. In 1870 all of the mines in the area closed and lumbering became the area's most significant industry, with millions of board feet being floated downstream. The railroad tracks were removed and the mine buildings were abandoned or burned down. However, deep mining of the Clarion coal formation and the Lower Kittaning coal formation in the Tangascootack Creek watershed began in the 1800s and continued into the early 1900s. Strip mining operations began in the 1950s and 1960s, {{with some of the}} deep mines and surface mines being remined in the 1980s. The Independent Regulatory Review Commission issued a statement in the summer of 1987, saying that part of the North Fork Tangascootack Creek watershed was no longer suitable for surface mining.

Several projects devoted to improving <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> of the creek had begun by 2001, by which point several more projects were planned.
