With this purpose, the rhythmic accompaniments used by pre-school teachers in music education and their observations about these accompaniments were analyzed. The sample of the study consisted of 3 pre-school teachers and 60 students in Antalya. The teachers taught the students 5 songs and had them accompany the songs with rhythm. Because the study had a qualitative research design, in-depth data gathering with a limited sample size was aimed. The data was gathered through reports written by the teachers about <b>the</b> rhythm <b>exercises.</b> <b>The</b> data gathered were analyzed using the qualitative analysis method of descriptive analysis. Observations of the teachers about <b>the</b> rhythm <b>exercise</b> process, <b>the</b> difficulties encountered during <b>the</b> <b>exercises,</b> <b>the</b> reactions of the children to <b>the</b> <b>exercises,</b> <b>the</b> preferences of the students concerning the musical instruments during <b>the</b> <b>exercises,</b> <b>the</b> rhythms that the children found to be difficult, and the activities done to develop the creative abilities of the children during <b>the</b> <b>exercises</b> were recorded.

5|$|Due to the 1989 {{amendments}} to the Constitution and the ISA, <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> of the subjectively worded powers in the ISA is not judicially reviewable by the courts, except when {{there has been some}} non-compliance with the procedures set out in the Act. On the other hand, the objective test laid down in Chng Suan Tze continues to be the law governing judicial review of <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> of executive discretion under subjectively worded provisions in statutes other than the ISA. In Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court of Appeal opined that the 1989 legislative amendments did not completely reverse Chng Suan Tze. Apart from restricting the courts' supervisory jurisdiction to reviewing decisions made under the ISA for procedural impropriety, Parliament did not disturb the principle laid down in Chng Suan Tze that the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion– that is, power without legal limits– is contrary to the rule of law, which demands that courts should be able to examine <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> of discretionary power. Since Parliament did not undermine this principle when it legislatively reversed Chng Suan Tze, it should be taken to have implicitly endorsed the principle.|$|E

5|$|Exclusion of {{judicial}} review has been attempted by the Parliament of Singapore to protect <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> of executive power. Typically, this has been done though the insertion of finality or total ouster clauses into Acts of Parliament, or by wording powers conferred by Acts on decision-makers subjectively. Finality clauses are generally viewed restrictively by courts in the United Kingdom. The courts there have taken the view that such clauses are, subject to some exceptions, not effective in denying or restricting {{the extent to which}} the courts are able to exercise judicial review. In contrast, Singapore cases suggest that ouster clauses cannot prevent the High Court from exercising supervisory jurisdiction over <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> of executive power where authorities have committed jurisdictional errors of law, but are effective against non-jurisdictional errors of law.|$|E

The detention orders were subsequently suspended under section 10 of the Act, but the suspensions were revoked following {{the release of a}} press statement by the appellants in which they denied being Marxist conspirators. Having applied unsuccessfully to the High Court for writs of habeas corpus to be issued, the appellants appealed against the ruling. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on the narrow ground that the Government had not adduced sufficient evidence to discharge its burden of proving the President was satisfied that the appellants' detention was necessary to prevent them from endangering, among other things, Singapore's security or public order, which was required by section 8(1) of the ISA before the Minister for Home Affairs could make detention orders against them. However, in a lengthy obiter discussion, the Court held that an objective rather than a subjective test should apply to <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> of discretion by the authorities under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA. In other words, the executive could not insist that <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> of the discretion was unchallengeable. <b>The</b> <b>exercise</b> of discretion could be reviewed by the court, and the executive had to satisfy the court that there were objective facts justifying its decision.|$|E
