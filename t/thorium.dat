5|$|Among the actinides, <b>thorium</b> and uranium are {{the easiest}} to isolate. <b>Thorium</b> is {{extracted}} mostly from monazite: <b>thorium</b> pyrophosphate (ThP2O7) is reacted with nitric acid, and the produced <b>thorium</b> nitrate treated with tributyl phosphate. Rare-earth impurities are separated by increasing the pH in sulfate solution.|$|E
5|$|The common {{production}} {{route of}} <b>thorium</b> constitutes concentration of <b>thorium</b> minerals; extraction of <b>thorium</b> from the concentrate; purification of thorium; and (optionally) conversion to compounds, such as <b>thorium</b> dioxide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thorium</b> {{can form}} alloys {{with many other}} metals. Addition of small {{proportions}} of <b>thorium</b> improves the mechanical strength of magnesium, and thorium-aluminium alloys have been considered {{as a way to}} store <b>thorium</b> in proposed future <b>thorium</b> nuclear reactors. <b>Thorium</b> forms eutectic mixtures with chromium and uranium, and it is completely miscible in both solid and liquid states with its lighter congener cerium.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{anomalous}} {{electron configuration}} for gaseous <b>thorium</b> atoms, metallic <b>thorium</b> shows significant 5f involvement. This was first realised in 1995, {{when it was}} pointed out that a hypothetical metallic state of <b>thorium</b> that had the 6d27s2 configuration with the 5f orbitals above the Fermi level should be hexagonal close packed like the group 4 elements titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, and not face-centred cubic as it actually is. The actual crystal structure can only be explained when the 5f states are invoked, proving that <b>thorium,</b> and not protactinium, acts as the first actinide metallurgically. The 5f character of <b>thorium</b> is also clear in the rare and highly unstable +3 oxidation state, in which <b>thorium</b> exhibits the electron configuration 5f1.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of incandescent filaments, recrystallisation of tungsten is signifiantly lowered by adding small amounts of <b>thorium</b> dioxide to the tungsten sintering powder before drawing the filaments. A small addition of <b>thorium</b> to tungsten thermocathodes considerably reduced the work function of electrons; as the result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures. Tungsten forms a one-atom-thick layer {{on the surface of}} <b>thorium.</b> The work function from a <b>thorium</b> surface is lowered possibly because of the electric field on the interface between <b>thorium</b> and tungsten formed due to thorium's greater electropositivity. Since the 1920s, thoriated tungsten wires have been used in electronic tubes and in the cathodes and anticathodes of X-ray tubes and rectifiers. Thanks to the reactivity of <b>thorium</b> with atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen, <b>thorium</b> also marks impurities in the evacuated tubes. The introduction of transistors in the 1950s significantly diminished this use, but not entirely. <b>Thorium</b> dioxide is used in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability. <b>Thorium</b> oxide is being replaced in this use with other oxides, such as those of zirconium, cerium, and lanthanum.|$|E
5|$|In deep seawaters the isotope 230Th {{make up to}} 0.04% {{of natural}} <b>thorium.</b> This is because its parent 238U is soluble in water, but 230Th is {{insoluble}} and precipitates into the sediment. Uranium ores with low <b>thorium</b> concentrations can be purified to produce gram-sized <b>thorium</b> samples of which over a quarter is the 230Th isotope, since 230Th {{is one of the}} daughters of 238U. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) reclassified <b>thorium</b> as a binuclidic element in 2013.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table published by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, <b>thorium</b> and the rare-earth elements were placed outside {{the main body of}} the table, at the end of each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals. This reflected the belief at that time that <b>thorium</b> and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and <b>thorium</b> was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved cerium and <b>thorium</b> to group IV in 1871, which contained the modern carbon group (group 14), titanium group (group 4), cerium, and <b>thorium,</b> because their maximum oxidation state was +4. Cerium was soon removed from {{the main body of the}} table and placed in a separate lanthanide series; <b>thorium</b> was left with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group, such as titanium and zirconium.|$|E
5|$|Many other {{inorganic}} <b>thorium</b> compounds with polyatomic anions are known, {{such as the}} perchlorates, sulfates, sulfites, nitrates, carbonates, phosphates, vanadates, molybdates, and chromates, {{and their}} hydrated forms. They are important in <b>thorium</b> purification and the disposal of nuclear waste, {{but most of them}} have not yet been fully characterised, especially regarding their structural properties. For example, <b>thorium</b> nitrate is produced by reacting <b>thorium</b> hydroxide with nitric acid: it is soluble in water and alcohols and is an important intermediate in the purification of <b>thorium</b> and its compounds. <b>Thorium</b> complexes with organic ligands, such as oxalate, citrate, and EDTA, are much stronger and tend to occur naturally in natural thorium-containing waters in concentrations orders of magnitude higher than the inorganic complexes.|$|E
5|$|Natural <b>thorium</b> decays {{very slowly}} {{compared}} {{to many other}} radioactive materials, and the emitted alpha radiation cannot penetrate human skin. As a result, handling small amounts of <b>thorium,</b> {{such as those in}} gas mantles, is considered safe, although the use of such items may pose some risks. Exposure to an aerosol of <b>thorium,</b> such as contaminated dust, can lead to increased risk of cancers of the lung, pancreas, and blood, as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation. Exposure to <b>thorium</b> internally leads to increased risk of liver diseases.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, <b>thorium</b> {{is not a}} rare element as was {{previously}} thought, having a crustal abundance {{comparable to that of}} lead and molybdenum, twice that of arsenic, and three times that of tin. <b>Thorium</b> only occurs as a minor constituent of most minerals. Soil normally contains about 6 ppm of <b>thorium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tests on the <b>thorium</b> uptake {{of workers}} {{involved}} in monazite processing showed <b>thorium</b> levels above recommended limits in their bodies, but no {{adverse effects on}} health were found at those moderately low concentrations. No chemical toxicity has yet been observed in the tracheobronchial tract and the lungs from exposure to <b>thorium.</b> People who work with <b>thorium</b> compounds are at a risk of dermatitis. It can take as much as thirty years after the ingestion of <b>thorium</b> for symptoms to manifest themselves.|$|E
5|$|Tetravalent <b>thorium</b> {{compounds}} {{are usually}} colourless or yellow, {{like those of}} silver or lead, as the Th4+ ion has no 5f or 6d electrons. <b>Thorium</b> chemistry is therefore largely that of an electropositive metal forming a single diamagnetic ion with a stable noble-gas configuration, indicating a similarity between <b>thorium</b> and the main group elements of the s-block. <b>Thorium</b> and uranium are the most investigated of the radioactive elements because their radioactivity is low enough not to require special handling in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thorium</b> borides, carbides, silicides, and {{nitrides}} are refractory materials, as {{are those}} of uranium and plutonium, and have thus received attention as possible nuclear fuels. All four heavier pnictogens (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth) also form binary <b>thorium</b> compounds. <b>Thorium</b> germanides are also known. <b>Thorium</b> reacts with hydrogen to form the <b>thorium</b> hydrides ThH2 and Th4H15, the latter of which is superconducting below 7.5–8K; at standard temperature and pressure, it conducts electricity like a metal. The hydrides are thermally unstable and readily decompose upon exposure to air or moisture.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thorium</b> {{exists in}} very small {{quantities}} everywhere on Earth: the average human contains about 100micrograms of <b>thorium</b> and typically consumes three micrograms per day. Most <b>thorium</b> exposure occurs through dust inhalation; some <b>thorium</b> comes {{with food and}} water, but because of its low solubility, this exposure is negligible.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thorium</b> {{has been}} {{suggested}} as a nuclear power source and a possible replacement to the currently used uranium and plutonium. India, which has little uranium but much <b>thorium,</b> is a big proponent of development of thorium-based power technologies and has prioritised developing a <b>thorium</b> fuel cycle.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thorium</b> is {{a highly}} {{reactive}} and electropositive metal. With a standard reduction potential of −1.90V for the Th4+/Th couple, it is somewhat more electropositive than zirconium or aluminium. Finely divided <b>thorium</b> metal can exhibit pyrophoricity, spontaneously igniting in air. When heated in air, <b>thorium</b> turnings ignite and burn with a brilliant white light to produce the dioxide. In bulk, the reaction of pure <b>thorium</b> with air is slow, although corrosion may eventually occur after several months; most <b>thorium</b> samples are contaminated {{with varying degrees of}} the dioxide, which greatly accelerates corrosion. Such samples slowly tarnish in air, becoming grey and finally black at the surface.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thorium</b> is {{odourless}} and tasteless. The chemical {{toxicity of}} <b>thorium</b> is low because <b>thorium</b> and its most common compounds (mostly the dioxide) are poorly soluble in water, precipitating out {{before entering the}} body as the hydroxide. Some <b>thorium</b> compounds are chemically moderately toxic, especially {{in the presence of}} strong complex-forming ions such as citrate that carry the <b>thorium</b> into the body in soluble form. If <b>thorium</b> is ingested, 0.4% of it and 90% of its dangerous daughters are leached into the body. Out of the <b>thorium</b> that does remain in the body, three quarters of it accumulates in the skeleton. Absorption through the skin is possible, but is not a likely means of exposure. Thorium's low solubility in water also means that excretion of <b>thorium</b> by the kidneys and faeces is rather slow.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thorium</b> {{is rather}} active chemically. Owing {{to lack of}} {{electrons}} on 6d and 5f orbitals, the tetravalent <b>thorium</b> compounds are colorless. At pH < 3, the solutions of <b>thorium</b> salts are dominated by the cations 4+. The Th4+ ion is relatively large, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95 and 1.14 Å. As a result, <b>thorium</b> salts have a weak tendency to hydrolyse. The distinctive ability of <b>thorium</b> salts is their high solubility, not only in water, but also in polar organic solvents.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide {{production}} of <b>thorium</b> {{is a few}} tens of tons per year. The low demand makes working mines for extraction of <b>thorium</b> alone not profitable, and it is almost always extracted with the rare earths, which themselves may be by-products of {{production of}} other minerals. The current reliance on monazite for production is due to <b>thorium</b> being largely produced as a by-product; other sources such as thorite contain more <b>thorium</b> and could easily be used for production if demand rose. Present knowledge {{of the distribution of}} <b>thorium</b> resources is poor, as low demand has led to exploration efforts being relatively minor.|$|E
5|$|Actinides with {{oxidation}} state +6, {{except for the}} AnO22+-type cations, form 2−, 2− and other complex anions. For example, uranium, neptunium and plutonium form salts of the Na2UO4 (uranate) and (NH4)2U2O7 (diuranate) types. In comparison with lanthanides, actinides more easily form coordination compounds, and this ability increases with the actinide valence. Trivalent actinides do not form fluoride coordination compounds, whereas tetravalent <b>thorium</b> forms K2ThF6, KThF5, and even K5ThF9 complexes. <b>Thorium</b> also forms the corresponding sulfates (for example Na2SO4·Th (SO4)2·5H2O), nitrates and thiocyanates. Salts with the general formula An2Th(NO3)6·nH2O are of coordination nature, with the coordination number of <b>thorium</b> equal to 12. Even easier is to produce complex salts of pentavalent and hexavalent actinides. The most stable coordination compounds of actinides – tetravalent <b>thorium</b> and uranium – are obtained in reactions with diketones, e.g. acetylacetone.|$|E
5|$|Berzelius {{made some}} initial characterisations {{of the new}} metal and its {{chemical}} compounds: he correctly determined that the thorium–oxygen mass ratio of <b>thorium</b> oxide was 7.5 (its actual value is close to that, ~7.3), but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent, and so calculated that the atomic mass was 7.5 times that of oxygen (120 amu); it is actually 15 times as large. He determined that <b>thorium</b> was a very electropositive metal, ahead of cerium and behind zirconium in electropositivity. Metallic <b>thorium</b> was isolated {{for the first time}} in 1914 by Dutch entrepreneurs Dirk Lely Jr. and Lodewijk Hamburger.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Glenn T. Seaborg {{established}} that when <b>thorium</b> was bombarded with neutrons, {{it could be}} transformed into fissile uranium-233. This was another possible route to an atomic bomb, especially if {{it turned out that}} uranium-233 could be more easily separated from <b>thorium</b> than plutonium from uranium. It was not pursued further because uranium-233 production would have required a complete redesign of the Hanford reactors; but in April 1944 the Metallurgical Laboratory's Thorfin R. Rogness calculated that a nuclear reactor containing <b>thorium</b> could produce enough uranium-233 to sustain its reaction without adding anything but more <b>thorium.</b> This was very interesting, because {{at the time it was}} thought that uranium might be scarce, whereas <b>thorium</b> was at least ten times more plentiful.|$|E
5|$|In the universe, <b>thorium</b> {{is among}} the rarest of the {{primordial}} elements, because {{it is one of}} the two elements that can be produced only in the r-process, and also because it has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed. The only primordial elements rarer than <b>thorium</b> are uranium, also produced only by the r-process, and thulium, lutetium, tantalum, and rhenium, the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals. Neutron capture by nuclides beyond A = 209 often results in nuclear fission instead of neutron absorption, reducing the fraction of nuclei that cross the gap of instability past bismuth to become actinides such as <b>thorium.</b> In the distant past the abundances of <b>thorium</b> and uranium were enriched by the decay of plutonium and curium isotopes, and <b>thorium</b> was enriched relative to uranium by the decay of 236U to 232Th and the natural depletion of 235U, but these sources have long since decayed and no longer contribute.|$|E
5|$|Large {{coordination}} {{numbers are}} the rule for <b>thorium</b> {{due to its}} large size. <b>Thorium</b> nitrate pentahydrate was the first known example of coordination number 11, the oxalate tetrahydrate has coordination number 10, and the borohydride (first prepared in the Manhattan Project) has coordination number 14. These <b>thorium</b> salts {{are known for their}} high solubility in water and polar organic solvents.|$|E
5|$|Lutetium {{tantalate}} (LuTaO4) is the densest known stable {{white material}} (density 9.81 g/cm3) and therefore {{is an ideal}} host for X-ray phosphors. The only denser white material is <b>thorium</b> dioxide, with density of 10 g/cm3, but the <b>thorium</b> it contains is radioactive.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the work}} on organothorium {{compounds}} {{has focused on the}} cyclopentadienyls and cyclooctatetraenyls. Like many of the early and middle actinides (up to americium, and also expected for curium), <b>thorium</b> forms the yellow cyclooctatetraenide complex Th(C8H8)2, thorocene. It is isotypic with the better-known analogous uranium compound uranocene. It can be prepared by reacting K2C8H8 with <b>thorium</b> tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at the temperature of dry ice, or by reacting <b>thorium</b> tetrafluoride with MgC8H8. It is unstable in air and decomposes in water or at 190°C. Half-sandwich compounds are also known, such as (η8-C8H8)ThCl2(THF)2, which has a piano-stool structure and is made by reacting thorocene with <b>thorium</b> tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran.|$|E
5|$|Natural <b>thorium</b> {{is usually}} almost pure 232Th, {{which is the}} longest-lived and most stable isotope of <b>thorium,</b> having a {{half-life}} comparable {{to the age of}} the universe. Its radioactive decay is the largest single contributor to the Earth's internal heat; the other major contributors are the shorter-lived primordial radionuclides, which are 238U, 40K, and 235U in descending order of their contribution. (At the time of the Earth's formation, 40K and 235U contributed much more by virtue of their short half-lives, but they have decayed more quickly, leaving the contribution from 232Th and 238U predominant.) The other natural <b>thorium</b> isotopes are much shorter-lived; of them, only 230Th is usually detectable, occurring in secular equilibrium with its parent 238U, and making up at most 0.04% of natural <b>thorium.</b>|$|E
5|$|On Earth, <b>thorium</b> is {{much more}} abundant: with an {{abundance}} of 8.1parts per million (ppm) in the Earth's crust, {{it is one of the}} most abundant of the heavy elements, almost as abundant as lead (13ppm) and more abundant than tin (2.1ppm). This is because <b>thorium</b> is likely to form oxide minerals that do not sink into the core; it is classified as a lithophile. Common <b>thorium</b> compounds are also poorly soluble in water. Thus, even though the Earth contains the same abundances of the elements as the Solar System as a whole, there is more accessible <b>thorium</b> than heavy platinum group metals in the crust.|$|E
5|$|Other organothorium {{compounds}} are not well-studied. Tetrabenzylthorium, Th(CH2C6H5), and tetraallylthorium, Th(C3H5)4, are known, {{but their}} structures {{have not been}} determined and they decompose slowly at room temperature. <b>Thorium</b> forms the monocapped trigonal prismatic anion 3−, heptamethylthorate, which forms the salt 3 (tmeda = Me2NCH2CH2NMe2). Although one methyl group is only attached to the <b>thorium</b> atom (Th–C distance 257.1pm) and the other six connect the lithium and <b>thorium</b> atoms (Th–C distances 265.5–276.5pm) they behave equivalently in solution. Tetramethylthorium, Th(CH3)4, is not known, but its adducts are stabilised by phosphine ligands.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes <b>thorium</b> is {{extracted}} by electrolysis of a fluoride {{in a mixture}} of sodium and potassium chloride at 700–800°C in a graphite crucible. Highly pure <b>thorium</b> can be extracted from its iodide with the crystal bar process.|$|E
5|$|The {{properties}} of <b>thorium</b> vary widely {{depending on the}} degree of impurities in the sample. The major impurity is usually <b>thorium</b> dioxide (ThO2); even the purest <b>thorium</b> specimens usually contain about a tenth of a percent of the dioxide. Experimental measurements of its density give values between 11.5and11.66g/cm3: these are slightly lower than the theoretically expected value of 11.7g/cm3 calculated from thorium's lattice parameters, perhaps due to microscopic voids forming in the metal when it is cast. These values lie between those of its neighbours actinium (10.1g/cm3) and protactinium (15.4g/cm3), part of a trend across the early actinides.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{categories}} of <b>thorium</b> minerals for <b>thorium</b> extraction: primary and secondary. Primary deposits occur in acidic granitic magmas and pegmatites. They are concentrated, but of small size. Secondary deposits occur at the mouths of rivers in granitic mountain regions. In these deposits, <b>thorium</b> is enriched along with other heavy minerals. Initial concentration varies {{with the type of}} deposit.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thorium</b> fuels {{also result}} in a safer and better-performing reactor core because <b>thorium</b> dioxide has a higher melting point, higher thermal conductivity, lower {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion and is more stable chemically than the now-common fuel uranium dioxide, which can further oxidise to triuranium octoxide (U3O8).|$|E
5|$|<b>Thorium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Th and atomic number 90. <b>Thorium</b> metal is silvery and tarnishes black {{when it is}} exposed to air, forming the dioxide; it is moderately hard, malleable, and has a high melting point. <b>Thorium</b> is an electropositive actinide whose chemistry {{is dominated by the}} +4 oxidation state; it is quite reactive and can ignite in air when finely divided.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thorium</b> is a {{moderately}} hard, paramagnetic, bright silvery radioactive actinide metal. In the periodic table, it lies {{to the right}} of actinium, to the left of protactinium, and below cerium. Pure <b>thorium</b> is very ductile and, as normal for metals, can be cold-rolled, swaged, and drawn. At room temperature, <b>thorium</b> metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure; it has two other forms at exotic conditions, one at high temperature (over 1360°C; body-centred cubic) and one at high pressure (around 100GPa; body-centred tetragonal).|$|E
5|$|<b>Thorium</b> {{is nearly}} half as dense as uranium and plutonium, and is harder {{than either of}} them. It becomes superconductive below 1.4K. Thorium's melting point of 1750°C is above both those of {{actinium}} (1227°C) and protactinium (1568°C). In the beginning of period 7, from francium to <b>thorium,</b> the melting points of the elements increase (as in other periods), {{because the number of}} delocalised electrons each atom contributes increases from one in francium to four in <b>thorium,</b> leading to greater attraction between these electrons and the metal ions as their charge increases from one to four. After <b>thorium,</b> there is a new downward trend in melting points from <b>thorium</b> to plutonium. The number of f electrons increases from about 0.4 to about 6, due to the itinerance of the f-orbitals, increasing hybridisation of the 5f and 6d orbitals, and the formation of directional bonds resulting in more complex crystal structures and weakened metallic bonding. (The f-electron count for <b>thorium</b> is a non-integer due to a 5f–6d overlap.) Among the actinides, <b>thorium</b> has the highest melting and boiling points and second-lowest density; actinium is lighter. Thorium's boiling point of 4788°C is the fifth-highest among all the elements with known boiling points, behind osmium, tantalum, tungsten, and rhenium.|$|E
