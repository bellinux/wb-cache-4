40|$|Abstract- The paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{designing}} digital circuits with the current-mode gates- novel digital gates operating with constant, continuous power supply current. The purpose is the provision of a high level of noise immunity of the chips, which compose both analog and digital circuits. The logical properties of the current-mode gates and logic (algebra) differ from classical voltage-mode gates and Boolean algebra respectively. Therefore, in this paper, the approaches to design of digital circuits based on current-mode gates are presented. Based on the first of these approaches, the computer-aided procedure, which allows to design, to verify and to visualize the current-mode digital circuits is proposed. This procedure is based on formulas for the conversion of logic expressions from Boolean algebra, VHDL descriptions of the current-mode circuits and the standard VHDL simulator (for example, Active-HDL), in which current-mode <b>table</b> <b>of</b> <b>resolution</b> and current-mode gate libraries should be included. The designed current-mode circuits are characterized by approximately equal hardware overheads in comparison with the similar circuits based on the classical voltage type of gates.

5|$|Immediately upon {{taking his}} seat in the Senate, Crittenden {{was named to the}} Committee on Public Lands and the Committee on the Judiciary, {{probably}} due to Clay's influence. Early in his term, Crittenden vociferously opposed Senator Thomas H. Benton's proposal to spend the federal budget surplus on public land graduation and military fortifications along the eastern seaboard. He also blasted the Jackson administration for issuing the Specie Circular, requiring that all payment for government land be made in gold or silver. He pointed out that the principles of the circular had been presented in a resolution on the Senate floor, but had been tabled by a large majority. Crittenden maintained that the <b>tabling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>resolution</b> was a condemnation by the Senate, yet the administration issued the circular only months later, overstepping, as Crittenden saw it, the bounds of the executive branch's authority. Crittenden debated the issue at length with Senator Benton, and Congress ultimately passed a bill requiring the government to accept the notes of specie-paying banks for the purchase of government lands, but President Jackson employed his pocket veto to prevent it from becoming law.|$|R
40|$|Security Council Resolution 1530, adopted {{within hours}} of the Madrid bombings on 11 March 2003, should give {{international}} lawyers pause for thought. It sought to denounce atrocity but, in so doing, it also unequivocally attributed responsibility for the bombings to ETA. It quickly emerged that this was a case of mistaken identity. The revelation of this mistake produced a wealth of questions regarding the capacity of states to manipulate the Security Council, the Council’s procedures themselves, the need or otherwise for evidence of attribution of responsibility, and the consequences, legal or political, that might arise in the light of a glaringly incorrect resolution. In focusing on Resolution 1530, this article considers law’s domain in the Security Council’s political context, particularly the hasty drafting and <b>tabling</b> <b>of</b> a <b>resolution</b> explicable only by reference to a rhetorical war on terror. It also considers the techniques of interpretation regarding so-called ‘terrorism resolutions’, the Security Council’s role as inquisitor and arbiter of evidence and the assumption of good faith on the part of members. It concludes by considering the Council’s future counter-terrorist role and the issue of the Council’s legitimacy...|$|R

40|$|In June 2014, the UN Human Rights Council {{established}} an intergovernmental working group to elaborate a treaty on business and human rights. In July 2015, {{the working group}} held its first session launching the negotiations process—the culmination of a global movement of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) {{that over the last}} four decades have called for greater corporate accountability for human rights violations. The advocacy activities of the Treaty Alliance, an alliance of NGOs that supports the development of the treaty, were pivotal to the <b>tabling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>resolution</b> establishing the working group. These organizations now have the opportunity to engage with the negotiations process, both formally and informally, through consultations, advocacy, and lobbying. This article considers the impact NGOs may have in the drafting negotiations of the proposed treaty. It identifies several lobbying and advocacy strategies that were successful in previous international law-making processes and discusses {{the extent to which they}} could be applied to the current negotiations. It presents the benefits of an NGO coalition, of formal and informal lobbying strategies, and of the development of a common NGOs and friendly states framework. It analyses the reasons for Western states’ opposition and suggests lobbying strategies that may overcome it. Recognizing the unique subject matter of this treaty, it also focuses on lobbying corporate actors, and explores the complementarity between the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the treaty and the need for NGOs to support both. The article concludes on the necessity to compromise on essential points if a treaty is ever to emerge...|$|R
40|$|Tabled {{resolution}} augments Prolog-style SLDNF resolution {{for evaluating}} normal logic programs. At {{a high level}} the central idea in tabled evaluation is to maintain all the subgoal invocations in a call table and their computed answers in an answer table. By using answer tables for resolving subsumed subgoal invocations (i. e. subgoals that are particular instances of other subgoals in the call table) tabled resolution strategies can prevent infinite looping that happens in Prolog-style evaluation. Thus termination properties <b>of</b> <b>tabled</b> <b>resolution</b> is substantially better than that of Prolog. Moreover, unlike Prolog, tabled resolution can also avoid redundant computations and hence improve the running time of programs. Resolving subsumed subgoals against answers may require accessing answer tables that are either complete or incomplete (i. e., more answers remain to be added). Since {{it is far more}} efficient to retrieve from completed tables, scheduling strategies promote more frequent usage [...] ...|$|R

With the aid of the FEM, the structural dimensions of the moving part and flexure hinges is designed with the consideration of stiffness match between the moving part and the piezoelectric translators. Meanwhile, the position of flexure hinges is also chosen to reduce bending deformation of the moving part and to enlarge external dimensions <b>of</b> the workpiece <b>table.</b> The theoretical algorithm of the moving part rotating about an arbitrary symmetric axis is developed.

40|$|Resolution-based Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) systems, such as Flora- 2, Silk or Ergo, can {{scale to}} tens or {{hundreds}} of millions of facts, while supporting reasoning that includes Hilog, inheritance, defeasibility theories, and equality theories. These systems handle the termination and complexity issues that arise from the use of these features by a heavy use <b>of</b> <b>tabled</b> <b>resolution.</b> In fact, such systems table by default all rules defined by users, unless they are simple facts. Performing dynamic updates within such systems is nearly impossible unless the tables themselves can be made to react to changes. Incremental tabling as first implemented in XSB (Saha 2006) partially addressed this problem, but the implementation was limited in scope and not always easy to use. In this paper, we introduce transparent incremental tabling which at the semantic level supports updates in the 3 -valued well-founded semantics, while guaranteeing full consistency <b>of</b> all <b>tabled</b> queries. Transparent incremental tabling also has significant performance improvements over previous implementations, including lazy recomputation, and control over the dependency structures used to determine how tables are updated.
