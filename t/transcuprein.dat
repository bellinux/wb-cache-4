25|$|Copper {{released}} from intestinal cells {{moves to the}} serosal (i.e., thin membrane lining) capillaries where it binds to albumin, glutathione, and amino acids in the portal blood. There is also evidence for a small protein, <b>transcuprein,</b> with a specific role in plasma copper transport Several {{or all of these}} copper-binding molecules may participate in serum copper transport. Copper from portal circulation is primarily taken up by the liver. Once in the liver, copper is either incorporated into copper-requiring proteins, which are subsequently secreted into the blood. Most of the copper (70 – 95%) excreted by the liver is incorporated into ceruloplasmin, the main copper carrier in blood. Copper is transported to extra-hepatic tissues by ceruloplasmin, albumin and amino acids, or excreted into the bile. By regulating copper release, the liver exerts homeostatic control over extrahepatic copper.|$|E

40|$|Copper is an {{essential}} cofactor for many enzymes, includ-ing cytochromes, but it is toxic in its unbound form. The vast majority of serum copper is transported bound to ceruloplasmin; the rest is bound to albumin, <b>transcuprein,</b> and copper–amino acid complexes. Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive disorder with a frequency of 1 in 30 000 to 1 in 100 000 live births, is caused by mutations in a P-type ATPase that prevent the incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin (1, 2). Copper deposition occurs in hepatic parenchymal cells, the brain, {{the periphery of the}} iris, and the kidney. The age of onset and form of presentation of Wilson disease are very variable. Initially, copper accumulates in the liver, and accordingly, hepatic presentations are common (1, 2). Diagnosis of Wilson disease is a challenge (3), particularly in the absence o...|$|E
40|$|Copper (Cu), as an {{essential}} metal, {{plays a crucial role}} in biochemical reactions and in physiological regulations. Cu in plasma is mostly bound to proteins; about 65 - 90 % of Cu is tightly binds with caeruloplasmin and the rest of Cu is loosely binds with albumin and <b>transcuprein.</b> A small but significant relatively "free" fraction, probably complexed with amino acids, is present at around 5 % of the total concentration. We developed and validated a new method for direct measurement of free Cu in serum by ultrafiltration with AMICON®Ultra 100 K device and determination with AAS. Also, we checked that there is no trace of albumin in the ultrafiltrates and we demonstrated the ultrafiltration of a known concentration of Cu added in artificial serum without albumin and, on the contrary, the retention of the Cu in artificial serum with albumin. The ultrafiltration procedure and the instrumental determination showed a good repeatability and a very low limit of detection (1 μg/L). The method was applied to 30 healthy subjects, the mean value of the total Cu (994. 8 μg/L) is included in the normal range for healthy people and the values of free Cu (23. 6 μg/L) corresponding to 2. 37 % of the Cu total. The determination of free Cu by this simple and cheap method may be useful to measure the most bioavailable Cu fraction possibly implicated in neuro-degenerative and oxidative-stress related diseases...|$|E
40|$|Ionic copper {{entering}} {{blood plasma}} binds tightly to albumin and the macroglobulin <b>transcuprein.</b> It then goes {{primarily to the}} liver and kidney except in lactation, where a large portion goes directly to the mammary gland. Little is known about how this copper is taken up from these plasma proteins. To examine this, the kinetics of uptake from purified human albumin and α 2 -macroglobulin, {{and the effects of}} inhibitors, were measured using human hepatic (HepG 2) and mammary epithelial (PMC 42) cell lines. At physiological concentrations (3 – 6 μM), both cell types took up copper from these proteins independently and at rates similar {{to each other and to}} those for Cu-dihistidine or Cu-nitrilotriacetate (NTA). Uptakes from α 2 -macroglobulin indicated a single saturable system in each cell type, but with different kinetics, and 65 – 80 % inhibition by Ag(I) in HepG 2 cells but not PMC 42 cells. Uptake kinetics for Cu-albumin were more complex and also differed with cell type (as was the case for Cu-histidine and NTA), and there was little or no inhibition by Ag(I). High Fe(II) concentrations (100 – 500 μM) inhibited copper uptake from albumin by 20 – 30 % in both cell types and that from α 2 -macroglobulin by 0 – 30 %, and there was no inhibition of the latter by Mn(II) or Zn(II). We conclude that the proteins mainly responsible for the plasma-exchangeable copper pool deliver the metal to mammalian cells efficiently and by several different mechanisms. α 2 -Macroglobulin delivers it primarily to copper transporter 1 in hepatic cells but not mammary epithelial cells, and additional as-yet-unidentified copper transporters or systems for uptake from these proteins remain to be identified...|$|E
