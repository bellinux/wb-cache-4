(Small being relative to the overall diameter, as it occupies about one-fourth the <b>total</b> <b>cross-section.)</b> The sloping interior walls are relatively light in hue, having a higher albedo as the surrounding terrain.

40|$|To {{settle the}} {{question}} whether the growth with energy is universal for different hadronic <b>total</b> <b>cross-sections,</b> we present results from theoretical models for pion-proton, proton-proton and proton-antiproton <b>total</b> <b>cross-sections.</b> We show that present and planned experiments at LHC can differentiate between different models, {{all of which are}} consistent with presently available (lower energy) data. This study is also relevant for the analysis of those very high energy cosmic ray data which require reliable pion-proton <b>total</b> <b>cross-sections</b> as seeds. A preliminary study of the <b>total</b> pion-pion <b>cross-sections</b> is also made. Comment: 18 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Physics Letters...|$|R
40|$|We discuss {{predictions}} for the <b>total</b> inelastic γγ <b>cross-section</b> and their model {{dependence on the}} input parameters. We compare results from a simple extension of the Regge Pomeron exchange model as well as predictions from the eikonalized mini-jet model with recent LEP data. It is by now established that all <b>total</b> <b>cross-sections,</b> including photoproduction, rise as the c. m. energy of the colliding particles increases. So far a successful description of <b>total</b> <b>cross-sections</b> is obtained in the Regge/Pomeron exchange model [1], in which a Regge pole and a Pomeron are exchanged and <b>total</b> <b>cross-sections</b> are seen to first decrease and subsequently rise according to the expressio...|$|R

50|$|Because {{neutrons}} {{interact with}} the nuclear potential, the scattering cross-section varies for different isotopes of the element in question. A very prominent example is hydrogen and its isotope deuterium. The <b>total</b> <b>cross-section</b> for hydrogen is over 10 times that of deuterium, mostly due to the large incoherent scattering length of hydrogen. Metals tend to be rather transparent to neutrons, aluminum and zirconium being the two best examples of this.|$|E

The grid separates the flame into an array of smaller flames with a common external envelope, and also prevents flashback {{to the bottom of the}} tube, which is a risk at high air-to-fuel ratios and limits the maximum rate of air intake in a conventional Bunsen burner.

50|$|The {{construction}} of the tunnel used a tunneling shield to drive through hard rock {{for the first time}} in Germany. Two identical, 2,500 ton and 220 m long tunnel boring machines (TBMs) tunnelled through 200 to 250 million years old strata at an average of 15 m per day. Here, from the outset, the <b>total</b> <b>cross-section</b> of each tunnel was excavated in one operation. The machines both possessed 3,200 kW drives, with a shield with a diameter of 11.16. m. To prevent the machine from losing the protection of the shield, all parts of the TBM were designed so that they could be substituted from behind. During the construction, the groundwater level was lowered in places.|$|E

Predications for the slower rate of growth at higher energies are also presented. Typeset using REVTEX 1 The recent observation [1, 2] of the rapid rise of parton density at small x has generated much theoretical interest [3].

40|$|In this note, we {{summarize}} {{and compare}} various model predictions for pp <b>total</b> <b>cross-section</b> σ_ tot^pp, giving {{an estimate of}} the range of predictions for the <b>total</b> <b>cross-section,</b> σ_ tot^pp expected at the LHC. We concentrate on the results for σ_^pp obtained in a particular QCD based model of the energy dependence of the <b>total</b> <b>cross-section,</b> including the effect of soft gluon radiation. We obtain the range of predictions in this model by exploring the allowed range of model parameters. We further give a handy parametrisation of these results which incidentally spans the range of various other available predictions at the LHC as well.

40|$|We have {{calculated}} part of O(α_S) QCD radiative correction to the <b>total</b> <b>cross-section</b> of top's threshold {{production in}} e^+e^-→ tt̅→ W^- b W^+b̅ reaction. We found out a curious fact: {{there is no}} O(α_S) correction to the <b>total</b> <b>cross-section,</b> originated from b b̅, t b̅,t̅ b gluon exchange and corresponding gluon emission. Thus, all O(α_S) corrections which are non-zero, can be classified as: 1) corrections to t t̅ nonrelativistic potential 2) corrections to the top's width 3) hard gluon correction to γ t t̅-vertex. These corrections are well-known and were described in the previous papers. We can conclude that similar situation takes place for all unstable particles threshold production. This result can be expressed {{in the form of}} a general statment: There is no O(α_QED or α_QCD) corrections for the <b>total</b> <b>cross-section,</b> originated from the "jet-jet" interection.
