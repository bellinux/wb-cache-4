Since the star is located further than 25 parsecs from Earth, it is not listed in the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars. With an apparent magnitude of 7.81, the star is not visible with the naked eye, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be seen using binoculars.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon is {{the only}} nation with a {{national}} law protecting this species. This law prohibits killing the rockfowl, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be captured with a proper permit. International trading of the grey-necked rockfowl is governed under CITES Appendix I, meaning that legal trading of this species is only authorized in extraordinary circumstances. In 2006 BirdLife International drafted an international action plan to provide strategies for protecting this species. This plan focused on surveying the remaining habitat, raising awareness amongst the local populace, and limiting the continued destruction of its habitat.|$|E
5|$|Peniophora quercina {{typically}} grows upon dead wood, {{which can}} {{be attached to the}} tree or fallen, where it causes white rot. It favours oak, but can also be found on other deciduous trees, such as beech. P.quercina is known to be a pioneer species on dead wood, which means it can be the first species to grow. It is found in Europe, where it is very common. <b>Though</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be encountered all year, it produces spores in late summer and autumn. It has also been recorded in Amur, in eastern Asia.|$|E

5|$|The length time {{in which}} {{offspring}} stay with their mother varies, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> last until the female's next calving. Likewise, calves may suckle for only a month or {{as long as a}} year. Females become sexually mature when they are four years old, while males become mature at four or five years. Spermatogenesis in male giraffes begins at three to four years of age. Males must wait until they are at least seven years old to gain the opportunity to mate.|$|E
5|$|Aquaria is a 2D sidescrolling action-adventure game, heavily {{focused on}} {{exploration}} and puzzle-solving, with non-linear gameplay. The player controls Naija, a lone underwater dweller; although {{similar to a}} human woman, Naija also has several fish-like qualities, {{such as the ability}} to breathe underwater and propel herself quickly with webbed feet. The game, originally only available for personal computers, was designed to be primarily controlled solely through the mouse, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> also be controlled with a keyboard or Xbox 360 controller. The player directs Naija through an underwater world composed of several distinct regions, ranging from caves to underwater ruins to sunlit oases. These areas are filled with plant and animal life, which can be hostile, friendly, or neutral towards her. Hostile plants and animals can hurt Naija, reducing her health meter, by touching her or firing projectiles at her.|$|E
5|$|Incubation of {{the eggs}} lasts 11 to 13 days and is {{performed}} solely by the female. The hatchlings are naked and quills do not begin to show until the third day. Only females brood the nestlings, though both parents may bring whole insects to their young. When a young rufous-crowned sparrow leaves the nest after eight or nine days, it is still incapable of flight, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> run through the underbrush; during this time it is still fed by the parents. Juveniles tend to leave their parent's territory and move into adjacent habitat in autumn or early winter. Reproductive success varies strongly with annual rainfall and is highest in wet El Niño years, since cool rainy weather reduces the activity of snakes, the main predator of the sparrow's nests.|$|E

5|$|L.lubrica fruit {{bodies are}} similar to those of Cudonia confusa, {{commonly}} known as the cinnamon jellybaby. The species can be differentiated by the fact that L.lubrica fruit bodies are more sturdy, and those of C.confusa are much paler in colour. Another Cudonia species, C. circinans (which is highly similar to C. lutea), is similar to L. lubrica, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be differentiated by its colour (which is more brown), spores (which are smaller and thinner) and texture (which is less slimy and gelatinous than L. lubrica). L. lubrica fruit bodies can also be mistaken for those of the much rarer L.atrovirens, which can be differentiated by its darker colouration. L.viscosa can again be differentiated by colouration; the species has a green head. However, as L. lubrica fruit bodies can sometimes have a greenish hue, differentiation between the two species is not always easy.|$|E
5|$|Plants grow {{best in a}} moist but well-drained, acidic soil, {{with added}} peat being helpful. They may be grown in coastal gardens in a {{sheltered}} position, and generally require some degree of shade. Once established, plants can tolerate short dry spells. As they age, plants may become straggly, but benefit from hard pruning after fertilizing and watering, which promotes compact, bushier growth. Common heath can be short-lived and difficult to transplant, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be readily grown as a pot plant. Along {{with other members of}} the genus, Epacris impressa initially proved difficult to grow and maintain on original soil in the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra.|$|E
5|$|The pale-brown bromine monofluoride (BrF) is {{unstable}} at room temperature, disproportionating {{quickly and}} irreversibly into bromine, bromine trifluoride, and bromine pentafluoride. It thus cannot be obtained pure. It may be synthesised by the direct {{reaction of the}} elements, or by the comproportionation of bromine and bromine trifluoride at high temperatures. Bromine monochloride (BrCl), a red-brown gas, quite readily dissociates reversibly into bromine and chlorine at room temperature and thus also cannot be obtained pure, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> {{be made by the}} reversible direct reaction of its elements in the gas phase or in carbon tetrachloride. Bromine monofluoride in ethanol readily leads to the monobromination of the aromatic compounds PhX (para-bromination occurs for X = Me, But, OMe, Br; meta-bromination occurs for the deactivating X = –CO2Et, –CHO, –NO2); this is due to heterolytic fission of the Br–F bond, leading to rapid electrophilic bromination by Br+.|$|E

5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon–nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and isocyanates (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (<b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The game, which largely {{follows the}} action RPG and hack and slash {{gameplay}} of previous {{games in the}} series, sees players alternate between the roles of Sora and Riku. Alternating between characters is done via the 'Drop' system. During gameplay, a Drop Gauge gradually depletes over time, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be replenished with items. When the gauge completely empties, control will switch to the other character, though players may also opt to drop manually at any time. Drop Points, which are earned by defeating enemies and completing optional objectives, can be spent on bonuses {{that can be used}} until the next time the character drops, such as a slower Drop Gauge or increased attack or defense. The game reuses the Command Deck system from Birth by Sleep, in which players can customize a deck filled with various actions, spells, and items that can be quickly selected. There are also several new elements added to the gameplay. Flowmotion allows players to move quickly about by performing actions such as bouncing off walls, grinding on rails and spinning around poles. Reality Shift is a system the player can use on certain objects or weakened opponents involving a touch-screen activated minigame unique to each world. These include dragging the screen to fling a target like a catapult, touching hidden words to take control of enemies, and playing a small rhythm-based game to cause fireworks to appear.|$|E
