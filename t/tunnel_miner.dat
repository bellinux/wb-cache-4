While the Rock Raiders are {{repairing}} the Chrome Crusher with the portable Tool Store, miner sneezes again and causes another cave-in, {{this time he}} gets separated from the other Rock Raiders. Docs drills through the cave-in and finds miner and the five Rock Raiders get in the Chrome Crusher. miner sneezes one last time and causes yet another cave-in, luckily this time it does not damage the Chrome Crusher.|$|E

50|$|On 20 November 1901, Arthur Collins {{was out of}} {{the country}} and his brother was in charge. A fire started in the Smuggler-Union outbuildings, and fed {{poisonous}} smoke into the mine <b>tunnels.</b> Twenty-four <b>miners</b> and mine foremen, both union and non-union, died. Vincent St. John arrived on the scene and, {{in the absence of any}} effective response by management, was credited with directing rescue efforts, including entering the smoke-filled mine at serious risk to his own health. St. John was credited with saving lives.|$|R
50|$|Interestingly Schmidt {{never used}} the tunnel to move his mine's ore. Instead, he sold the <b>tunnel</b> to another <b>miner</b> and moved away. A Ripley's Believe It or Not cartoon celebrated the feat, calling him the human mole. Schmidt's cabin, down below in Garlock, has been largely {{abandoned}} and stands {{as it was in}} the 1930s, preserved by the dry climate.|$|R
5000|$|A rancher {{found the}} Lake Valley silver {{deposits}} in Sierra County in 1876. Two {{years later he}} sold his claims to an engineer, who began mining. [...] The deposits are bedded manto-type deposits in Paleozoic limestone. The mines produced well {{for a few years}} after <b>miners</b> <b>tunneled</b> into a silver-lined cavity they named the “bridal chamber” that alone yielded 2.5 million troy ounces (78 tonnes) of silver.|$|R
50|$|Hepburn Springs has 7 {{sites on}} the Victorian Heritage Register: Hepburn Mineral Springs Reserve {{including}} the bathhouse and the pavilion; Hepburn Pool which was named Victoria's Favourite Built Place in 2004; Parma House; Blowhole Gold Diversion <b>Tunnel</b> where Chinese <b>miners</b> diverted the Jim Crow Creek; Former Macaroni Factory which is still owned by the descendents of the Lucini family; Jim Crow Creek Gold Mining Diversion Sluice and Breakneck Gorge Puddling Site which is located near the Blowhole.|$|R
2500|$|Rescuers {{immediately}} halted blasting in {{the access}} tunnel, and instead drilled a smaller {{hole through the}} approximately 14.5 metres of rock between {{the head of the}} access tunnel and the part of the side <b>tunnel</b> where the <b>miners</b> were trapped. Webb and Russell directed the work by listening {{to the sound of the}} drilling and judging the direction. [...] The hole was about 90 millimetres in diameter. A PVC pipe was used to line the hole, which was used to deliver fresh water, food and communications equipment to the men.|$|R
50|$|Butte, Montana is {{historically}} the second-greatest source of {{silver in the}} United States, {{second only to the}} Coeur d’Alene district in Idaho. Butte started as a placer gold camp in 1864, and the placers were exhausted by 1867. But in 1874 prospectors discovered silver veins. Butte flourished as a silver-mining district until <b>miners</b> <b>tunneled</b> into large copper veins in 1882. From then until the 1980s, Butte was primarily a copper-mining district, but with a lot of silver as a byproduct. Butte produced more than 716 million troy ounces (22,300 mt) of silver through 2005.|$|R

6000|$|Old Mother Nature {{shook her}} head. [...] "A {{lot of people}} think that," [...] said she, [...] "and often Miner is charged with {{destroying}} growing crops, eating seed corn, etc. That is because his tunnels are found running along the rows of plants. The fact is Miner has simply been hunting for grubs and worms around the roots of those plants. He hasn't touched the plants at all. I suspect that Danny Meadow Mouse or one of his cousins could explain who ate the seed corn and the young plants. They are rather fond of using <b>Miner's</b> <b>tunnels</b> when he isn't about." ...|$|R
5000|$|Drift mining {{methods were}} used {{extensively}} to mine placer deposits {{during the early}} years (1899- [...] ) of the Nome mining district. During summer, surface deposits could be worked, but some placer deposits were buried too deeply for surface placering. In addition, water to wash the gold from the placers was not available in the winter. Many <b>miners</b> <b>tunneled</b> into deep placer deposits, bringing out the high-grade gravels to be washed at the spring thaw. Most of the ground in Nome is permafrost. By drift mining, miners were able to recover much of the gold buried under the permafrost.|$|R
50|$|Between 1767 and 1925 {{there were}} 11 major {{incidents}} recorded at the colliery resulting in over 209 deaths. On 18 June 1835 a gas explosion {{in one of}} the <b>tunnels</b> killed 102 <b>miners,</b> the youngest of which was aged 8 and the oldest 75. Many of the dead were found with their cloth caps in their mouth. This {{is believed to have been}} an attempt to prevent inhalation of the gas which eventually killed them. The bodies were extracted and buried in St Peters churchyard at the top of the bank overlooking the Wallsend Burn. A plaque has been erected within the churchyard to commemorate this tragedy.|$|R
5000|$|A rancher {{found the}} Lake Valley silver {{deposits}} in Sierra County in 1876. The deposits are bedded manto-type deposits in Paleozoic limestone. The mines, promoted by Whitaker Wright, produced {{well for a}} few years after <b>miners</b> <b>tunneled</b> into a silver-lined cavity they named the “bridal chamber” that alone yielded 2.5 million troy ounces (78 metric tons) of silver. But no more bridal chambers were discovered, the mines struggled and were worked periodically into the 20th century. The district produced manganese during World Wars I and II. [...] Total production of the Lake Valley district through 1931 was 5.8 million ounces (180 metric tons) of silver.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of so much mining {{activity}} by both sides, detection and breakthrough into each other's tunnelling systems occurred frequently. The result was often the deployment of the emergency camouflet, a pre-prepared charge which was always ready in the British and Allied forces sectors when tunnelling was taking place. Vicious hand-to-hand fighting in the dark with picks, shovels and wood used as weapons might also take place. Although all miners were trained to use rifles, the restrictions of tunnel construction and {{the conditions of the}} <b>tunnels</b> where the <b>miners</b> had to operate often meant they could not be used. If the opposing side were unsuccessful in repelling an attack, then enemy tunnels could be used for short periods to observe enemy tunnelling activity and direction.|$|R
5000|$|The Detour was {{a choice}} between Mine or Music. In Mine, teams {{made their way to}} Wieliczka Salt Mine and descended 1000 ft into the salt mine. They then had to carry a large timber support beam to a loading area. After filling a mine cart with salt, teams pushed the cart back through the <b>tunnel</b> where a <b>miner</b> handed them their next clue. In Music, teams {{travelled}} to Kraków's Main Square where they had to choose a professional pianist, learn a musical piece, and roll a piano through the streets to a performance area. Teams then had to perform a duet with a violinist in order to attract donations from passers-by. Once they earned 100 zł (approximately [...] ), they received their next clue from the musician.|$|R
5000|$|The Tura {{limestone}} {{was deep}} underground {{and instead of}} open-pit mining, the <b>miners</b> <b>tunneled</b> deep underground to cut large stones out, leaving some limestone behind to support the caverns left behind. The caves were adapted by British forces during World War II to store ammunition, aircraft bombs, and other explosives. [...] These tunnels were surveyed in 1941, and in quarry 35, workmen found many loose quires from books by Origen and Didymus the Blind, two Alexandrian Church Fathers. The workers who found them stole them, and although some were seized by the authorities, most are still missing, and turn up on the antiquities market from time to time. It is believed {{that some of the}} original books could have been up to 480 pages.|$|R
5000|$|The Minesota fissure vein was {{discovered}} in 1847 when prospectors found a six-ton (5.4 mt) mass of native copper in a pit dug by aboriginal miners. In the pit was growing a hemlock nearly 400 years old {{by the number of}} growth rings. Mining began in 1848, and from 1855 through 1862, the Minesota was the most productive copper mine in the United States. [...] The mine had ten shafts, the deepest of which extended to a depth of 1200 feet (366 m). In 1856, <b>miners</b> <b>tunneled</b> into a 527-ton (478 mt) mass of native copper, the second-largest such mass found in the Copper Country. Besides masses of copper recovered through hand-sorting, the mine ran a small stamp mill to recover finer-grained copper in ore that ran 3%.|$|R
40|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is one of}} the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in both industrialized and developing countries. Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for COPD. However, relevant information from the literature published within the last years, either on general population samples or on workplaces, indicate that about 15 % of all cases of COPD is work-related. Specific settings and agents are quoted which have been indicated or confirmed as linked to COPD. Coal <b>miners,</b> hard-rock <b>miners,</b> <b>tunnel</b> workers, concrete-manufacturing workers, nonmining industrial workers have been shown to be at highest risk for developing COPD. Further evidence that occupational agents are capable of inducing COPD comes from experimental studies, particularly in animal models. In conclusion, occupational exposure to dusts, chemicals, gases should be considered an established, or supported by good evidence, risk factor for developing COPD. The implications of this substantial occupational contribution to COPD must be considered in research planning, in public policy decision-making, and in clinical practice...|$|R
6000|$|For {{several days}} the Jolly-cum-pop was highly amused {{at the idea}} of his being {{seventeen}} criminals, and he would sit first in one cell and then in another, trying to look like a ferocious pirate, a hard-hearted usurer, or a mean-spirited chicken thief, and laughing heartily at his failures. But, after a time, he began to tire of this, and to have a strong desire to see what sort of a <b>tunnel</b> the Prince's <b>miners</b> and rock-splitters were making under his house. [...] "I had hoped," [...] he said to himself, [...] "that I should pine away in confinement, and so be able to get through the window-bars; but with nothing to do, and seventeen rations a day, I see no chance of that. But I must get out of this jail, and, as there seems no other way, I will revolt." [...] Thereupon he shouted to the jailer {{through the hole in the}} door of his cell: [...] "We have revolted! We have risen in a body, and have determined to resist your authority, and break jail!" ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} January 1917, the 171st Tunnelling Company {{began work}} on the deep mine at Ontario Farm. The ground at the site {{selected}} for this mine proved very difficult {{as much of it}} was sandy clay. The miners began to dig at Boyle's Farm which is just on the southern side of the main road (Mesenstraat/Nieuwkerkestraat) passing by. The shaft went down 30 m and pumps were installed to bring air down and water out of the mine. After <b>tunnelling</b> forward, the <b>miners</b> broke into blue clay, extending the depth to some 40 m. After driving the gallery almost 200 m forward, the flooding was so bad that a dam had to be constructed and a new gallery started. Despite these obstacles, the tunnellers arrived under Ontario Farm at the end of May 1917 and installed the 60,000 lb ammonal charge with a day to spare. When it was detonated on 7 June 1915, the mine did not produce a crater but left a shallow indentation in the soft clay; the shock wave did great damage to the German position. The explosion caught two battalions of the 17th Bavarian Infantry Regiment during a relief, half of which were [...] "as good as annihilated".|$|R
40|$|Within {{the large}} variety of subtypes of chronic cough, either defined by their {{clinical}} or pathogenetic causes, occupational chronic cough may {{be regarded as}} one of the most preventable forms of the disease. Next to obstructive airway diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which are sometimes concomitant with chronic cough, this chronic airway disease gains importance in the field of occupational medicine since classic fiber-related occupational airway diseases will decrease in the future. Apart from acute accidents and incidental exposures which may lead to an acute form of cough, there are numerous sources for the development of chronic cough within the workplace. Over the last years, a large number of studies has focused on occupational causes of respiratory diseases and it has emerged that chronic cough is one of the most prevalent work-related airway diseases. Best-known examples of occupations related to the development of cough are coal <b>miners,</b> hard-rock <b>miners,</b> <b>tunnel</b> workers, or concrete manufacturing workers. As chronic cough is often based on a variety of non-occupational factors such as tobacco smoke, a distinct separation into either occupational or personally -evoked can be difficult. However, revealing the occupational contribution to chronic cough and to the symptom cough in general, which is the commonest cause for the consultation of a physician, can significantly lead to a reduction of the socioeconomic burden of the disease...|$|R
5000|$|The Chitral Fort was 80 yards {{square and}} built of mud, stone and timber. The walls were 25 {{feet high and}} eight feet thick. There was a short covered way to the river, the only water source. The fort held 543 people of whom 343 were combatants {{including}} five British officers. The units were the 14th Sikhs and a larger detachment of Kashmiri Infantry. Artillery support was 2 RML 7 pounder Mountain Gun without sights and 80 rounds of ammunition. There were only 300 cartridges per man and enough food for a month. There were trees and buildings near the walls and nearby hills from which sniping was possible with modern rifles. Captain Charles Townshend, later of Mesopotamia fame, commanded the fort.On 3 March a party was sent out to determine the enemy strength. Its loss was 23 killed and 33 wounded. Harry Frederick Whitchurch won a Victoria Cross for aiding the wounded. At {{about the same time}} a small relief force from Gilgit was defeated and the ammunition and explosives they were carrying captured. By 5 April the Chitralis were 50 yards from the walls. On 7 April they set fire to the south-east tower which burned for 5 hours but did not collapse. Four days later the Chitralis began digging a tunnel in order to blow open the fort. The tunnel started from a house where the Chitralis held noisy parties to hide the sounds of digging. By the time sounds of digging were heard {{it was too late to}} dig a counter mine. One hundred men rushed out of the eastern gate, found the mouth of the <b>tunnel,</b> bayoneted the <b>miners,</b> blew up the tunnel with explosives [...] and returned with a loss of eight men. On the night of 18 April someone shouted over the wall that the besiegers had fled. The next morning a heavily armed party found that this was true. Kelly's relief force entered Chitral on 20 April and found the besieged [...] "walking skeletons". The siege had lasted a month and a half and cost the defenders 41 lives.|$|R
