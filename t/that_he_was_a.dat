5|$|A Roman by birth, Honorius {{may have}} been one of those chosen by Pope Gregory the Great for the Gregorian mission to England, {{although}} it seems more likely <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> member of the second party of missionaries, sent in 601. It is not known if his name was given to him at birth or if he chose it when he became archbishop.|$|E
5|$|A death {{certificate}} discovered in 2009 shows that Beato {{was born in}} Venice in 1832 and died on 29 January 1909 in Florence. The {{death certificate}} also indicates <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> British subject and a bachelor. It is likely that early in his life Beato and {{his family moved to}} Corfu, at the time part of the British protectorate of the Ionian Islands, and so Beato was a British subject.|$|E
5|$|Ajtony's {{ethnicity}} is debated. Historian Paul Stephenson {{described him}} as a Magyar chieftain; according to historian László Makkai, he was of Kabar origin and his Turkic name may imply <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Pecheneg. In Romanian historiography, Ajtony has been considered the last member of a Romanian dynasty descended from Glad; historian Alexandru Madgearu wrote that the Latin name of Ajtony's seat (urbs Morisena) preserved a Romanian form.|$|E

5|$|Amin {{became the}} subject of rumours and myths, {{including}} a widespread belief <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> cannibal. Some of the rumours, such as the mutilation of one of his wives, were spread and popularised by the 1980 film Rise and Fall of Idi Amin and alluded to in the film The Last King of Scotland in 2006, a movie which earned actor Forest Whitaker an Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Amin.|$|E
5|$|By {{recasting}} {{a difference}} of judgment over {{the merits of the}} early work on the hydrogen bomb project into a matter of a security risk, Teller effectively damned Oppenheimer in a field where security was necessarily of paramount concern. Teller's testimony thereby rendered Oppenheimer vulnerable to charges by a Congressional aide <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Soviet spy, which resulted in the destruction of Oppenheimer's career.|$|E
5|$|De Coventre {{received}} a B. A. under John de Waltirstone from the University of Paris by Lent, 1333. Although he had probably completed a Licentiate in the Arts and a Master of Arts by 1335, because of {{gaps in the}} Paris records it is not certain <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Master until April 1345.|$|E

He had 13 known children with three different women, and leaves numerous descendants. A well-known descendant is former National Football League quarterback Brett Favre. Simon Favre's associations with property owners and prominent officials demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> person of very high social standing.|$|E
5|$|Hussain {{remained}} {{the president of}} the KCCA for two terms, and a member for many years. He also headed Pakistan Cricket Commentators Club (PCCC) in 2013. He was {{one of the founders of}} Jang Cricket Club. Cricket commentator, Chishty Mujahid, paid tributes his services and said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> multifaceted personality as a cricket administrator, commentator, journalist, critic, analyst, organizer and much more.|$|E
5|$|In late 1261 Breton {{is noted}} as owing £120 {{in the royal}} records. A {{notation}} next to the debt implies <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> canon of Hereford Cathedral at this point, but the Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300 does not identify him as such. Breton {{does not appear in}} the records from this point until after the Battle of Evesham in 1265, when he is noted as holding a grant of royal safeguarding.|$|E

5|$|In {{view of the}} {{scarcity}} of sources concerning Shepseskare, nothing is known for certain about his relation to his predecessors. He was most likely {{a member of the}} royal family, although the possibility <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> usurper unrelated to his predecessors cannot be totally excluded.|$|E
5|$|Jabarona {{was filled}} with Dinka {{refugees}} who had fled the fighting {{in the south of}} Sudan and were forced to live together in sub-standard conditions. Bok settled among people who were from the Aweil area of North Bahr al Ghazal and began using his Christian name of Francis once again. Bok was quickly arrested by the Sudanese police for telling his friends and neighbors <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> slave. Slavery in Sudan is a subject that was largely denied by the government in Khartoum and anybody that spoke of it could be arrested or even killed. Francis was interrogated numerous times while he was imprisoned and each time he denied <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> slave. He was finally released from prison after seven months. Once he was released Bok decided that he must leave Sudan. Through the help of some Dinka tribesman he was able to acquire a Sudanese passport on the black market and obtain a ticket for passage to Cairo.|$|E
5|$|Musicians {{and critics}} {{vary in their}} {{appraisal}} of Tristano as a musician. Some describe his playing as cold and suggest that his innovations had little impact; others state <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bridge between bebop and later, freer forms of jazz, and assert that he is less appreciated than he should be because commentators found him hard to categorize and because {{he chose not to}} commercialize.|$|E

5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Æthelhard's family {{background}} or early life, however it is assumed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> native of Mercia. He first appears in the historical record as abbot of a monastery at Louth, Lincolnshire before being named to the diocese of Winchester. He was consecrated Bishop of Winchester sometime after 759 and before 778.|$|E
5|$|One vocalist whose {{status is}} disputed, {{both inside and}} outside Black Sabbath, is Christian evangelist and former Joshua frontman, Jeff Fenholt. Fenholt has insisted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> singer in Black Sabbath between January and May 1985. Tony Iommi has never {{confirmed}} this. Fenholt gives a detailed account of his time with Iommi and Sabbath in Garry Sharpe-Young's book Sabbath Bloody Sabbath: The Battle for Black Sabbath.|$|E
5|$|Some authors {{consider}} the marriage episode of Tulsidas to be a later interpolation and maintain <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bachelor.

5|$|Some of Swaminarayan's {{followers}} {{believe he}} was an incarnation of Lord Krishna. The images and stories of Swaminarayan and Krishna have coincided in the liturgy of the sect. The story {{of the birth of}} Swaminarayan parallels that of Krishna's birth from the scripture Bhagavata Purana. Swaminarayan himself is said to have intimated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> manifestation of God in a meeting with Reginald Heber, the Lord Bishop of Calcutta, in 1825.|$|E
5|$|Speelman's fleet left Jepara, {{anchored}} off Surabaya {{in early}} April {{and tried to}} start negotiations with Trunajaya. Trunajaya was initially friendly towards the VOC, {{but he refused to}} meet Speelman on board a VOC ship. The VOC's impression of Trunajaya declined after he failed to keep an appointment on neutral waters, and after emissaries reported <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drunkard. By the end of April, Speelman had decided to attack Surabaya over negotiations.|$|E
