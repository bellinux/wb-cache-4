5000|$|After leaving Berklee and {{relocating}} to Manhattan in March 1998, Gavin {{almost immediately}} began making substantial career inroads, gradually and organically {{laying the groundwork}} for a musical career. [...] "I kept having small successes," [...] he recalls, [...] "just things like applause from small audiences, or people saying they'd heard about me.

[...] Within a few months of his arrival, Gavin made his way into the Ron Grant and Friends open-mic night at Wilson's, <b>the</b> noted <b>upper</b> <b>west</b> <b>side</b> restaurant inside <b>the</b> Lucerne hotel. After wowing the audience, the next day the night manager and talent coordinator Shar Thompson introduced Degraw to the club's owner, Debbie Wilson.

[...] "When I first heard Gavin perform, I turned to Debbie (his manager) and said I need to sign this guy right now, says Randy Sabiston, Senior Director of A&R at Warner Chappell. [...] "Gavin is a truly special songwriter and as a publisher I didn't need to mull it over in my head; it was instant, a no brainer." [...] Early on, Gavin was offered a deal by a major label. Rather than succumb to the obvious temptation, he chose to decline the offer and continue his development as a songwriter and performer, while paying the rent by working as a waiter and newsstand clerk.
