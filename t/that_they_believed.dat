5|$|On 17 January 2011, {{police in}} Nemi, Italy, {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> they {{had discovered the}} site of Caligula's burial, after arresting a thief caught smuggling a statue which they believed {{to be of the}} emperor. The claim has been met with scepticism by Cambridge historian Mary Beard.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{arguments of}} the protesters were their concern about making wildlife species, such as the Chalkhill Blue butterfly, extinct, putting a highly visible scar on the landscape, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> the new motorway would not adequately resolve traffic problems.|$|E
5|$|The Clark Field Rescue Coordinating Center {{declared}} the aircraft missing {{the morning of}} 16 March 1962. Navy officials reported <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that the aircraft had crashed closer to Guam than the Philippines.

5|$|The {{development}} of parliamentary supremacy in the British Isles did not constitutionally affect the Thirteen Colonies, which retained an adherence to English common law, but it directly affected {{the relationship between}} Britain and the colonies. When American colonists fought against Britain, they were fighting {{not so much for}} new freedom, but to preserve liberties and rights <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> to be enshrined in Magna Carta.|$|E
5|$|Both coaches {{told the}} media <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> their {{respective}} teams should play {{far better than}} they did in the National semifinal games if they wanted to win the upcoming game. Coach Smith expressed concerns over Georgetown's shooting ability and feared that Floyd would come out shooting very well from the field. In addition, Smith noted that Ewing would play a large factor in the game because his defensive presence in the game limits second chance opportunities for Georgetown's opponents. Ken Rappoport of the Associated Press wrote of how North Carolina was a very disciplined team that takes only high-percentage shots.|$|E
5|$|Five {{days after}} the battle ended, on October 24, 1781, the British fleet sent by Clinton to rescue the British army arrived. The fleet picked up several Loyalists who had escaped on October 18, and they {{informed}} Admiral Thomas Graves <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> Cornwallis had surrendered. Graves picked up several more Loyalists along the coast, and they confirmed this fact. Graves sighted the French Fleet, but chose to leave because he was outnumbered by nine ships, and thus he sent the fleet back to New York.|$|E

5|$|The jury {{agreed with}} Adams and acquitted {{six of the}} {{soldiers}} after two and one-half hours' deliberation. Two of the soldiers were found guilty of manslaughter because there was overwhelming evidence that they had fired directly into the crowd. The jury's decisions suggest <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> the soldiers had felt threatened by the crowd, but should have delayed firing. Patrick Carr, the fifth victim, corroborated this with deathbed testimony delivered to his doctor. The convicted soldiers were granted reduced sentences by invoking Benefit of clergy, which reduced their punishment from a death sentence to branding of the thumb in open court.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} issues confronting the delegates was that of slavery. Slavery was widespread in the states {{at the time of}} the Convention. At least a third of the Convention's 55 delegates owned slaves, including all of the delegates from Virginia and South Carolina. Slaves comprised approximately one-fifth of the population of the states; and apart from northernmost New England, where slavery had largely been eliminated, slaves lived throughout all regions of the country. The majority of the slaves (more than 90%), however, lived in the South, where approximately 1 in 3 families owned slaves (in the largest and wealthiest state, Virginia, that figure was nearly 1 in 2 families). The entire agrarian economy of the South was based on slave labor, and the Southern delegates to the Convention were unwilling to accept any proposals <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> would threaten the institution.|$|E
5|$|Another notable {{religious}} {{incident occurred}} in the central region under Cẩn's rule in 1963. A hugely oversized carp was found swimming in a small pond near the central city of Đà Nẵng. Local Buddhists began {{to believe that the}} fish was a reincarnation of one of Gautama Buddha's disciples. As pilgrimages to the pond became larger and more frequent, so did disquiet among Cẩn's district chief and his subordinates. The local law enforcement agencies mined the pond, but the fish survived. They raked the pond with machine gun fire, but the fish again survived. To deal with the tenacious fish, they called in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces, led by Colonel Lê Quang Tung under the direction of Nhu. The grenading of the pond finally killed the carp. The killing had the unintended effect of increasing the public profile of the carp, with newspapers across the world running stories about the miraculous fish. Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) helicopters began landing at the site, with paratroopers filling their bottles with water <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> to be magical.|$|E

5|$|Both {{countries}} faced {{difficulty in}} financing their own dreadnoughts. Although in Argentina the ruling National Autonomist Party supported the purchases, they initially faced public resistance for such expensive acquisitions. An influx of inflammatory newspaper editorials supporting new dreadnoughts, especially from La Prensa, and renewed border disputes, particularly Brazilian assertions that the Argentines {{were attempting to}} restore the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, swayed the public to support the purchases. The Argentine President, José Figueroa Alcorta, attempted to ease the tensions with a message warning the Brazilians of a naval arms race should they continue on their present course. The Brazilian government replied with reasoning similar to Pena's speech in 1906, in <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated equipment left by the long-term neglect of the Brazilian Navy, and they repeatedly insisted that the ships were not meant for use against Argentina.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Great Awakening, {{the region}} was a hotbed of {{religious}} enthusiasm. Between 1817 and 1825, there were several camp meetings and revivals in the Palmyra area. Although Smith's parents disagreed about religion, the family {{was caught up in}} this excitement. Smith later said he became interested in religion by about the age of twelve. As a teenager, he may have been sympathetic to Methodism. With other family members, Smith also engaged in religious folk magic, which was a relatively common practice in that time and place. Both his parents and his maternal grandfather reportedly had visions or dreams <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> communicated messages from God. Smith said that, although he had become concerned about the welfare of his soul, he was confused by the claims of competing religious denominations.|$|E
5|$|Following a fall in game {{attendance}} in 2009 and 2010, Start decided {{ahead of the}} 2011 season to reduce the stadium's capacity. Advertisement banners were sold to cover the corners, thus reducing the capacity to 11,700 tickets. The club stated that the intention was to move spectators closer together to increase the atmosphere, {{and at the same}} time making it easier to sell out the stadium. In February 2012, Kristiansand District Court sentenced Start to pay NOK6.4 million in value added tax on the naming rights. The club stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> the naming rights were exempt. After the 2011 season, Start was again relegated to the First Division. In an attempt to better the club's financial situation, Start agreed to lay artificial turf on Sparebanken Sør Arena, in exchange for NOK250,000 in municipal funding to use the stadium for recreational sports. Removal of the natural pitch started on 28 May 2012.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, {{the archaeologists}} {{returned}} {{to search for}} the settlement <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> was associated with the graves. There are examples elsewhere, such as at Garton Green Lane Crossing in the Yorkshire Wolds, of 7th-century graves associated with prehistoric monuments, and it was initially thought that the Street House graves were a similar example. However, the excavation uncovered another twelve graves. It was realised that the cemetery was far larger than first thought, so the following year an archaeological survey of the entire site was attempted. A total of 109 graves was found {{by the end of the}} 2007 dig, forming a complex monument laid out in a unique square fashion around a central mound, a bed burial and a building that had possibly served as a mortuary.|$|E
5|$|Rosenborg had {{originally}} planned to build additional commercial facilities and a tower hotel during the 2002 construction, {{but this was}} canceled. At the 2011 annual meeting, the plans were again launched by Skutle, who stated that construction might start as early as 2011. In March 2005, Rosenborg announced {{plans to build a}} retractable roof over the pitch and lay artificial turf. The roof was estimated to cost NOK100 million, and the club estimated that it could generate NOK30 million per year in increased revenue from concerts and events. By 2007, the roof plans were delayed, with management stating that it would be necessary to complete the construction of all stands before a roof was built, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> the stadium would soon be expanded.|$|E
5|$|Six {{divisions}} of MiG-9s, each with two regiments of 31 aircraft, {{were transferred to}} China in November–December 1950 for air defense and training duties. The 17th Guards Fighter Aviation Division (GIAD) defended Shenyang, the 20th Fighter Aviation Division (IAD) guarded Tangshan, and the 65th IAD protected Guangzhou. The 144th IAD defended Shanghai, the 309th guarded Gongzhuling and the 328th IAD protected Peking. These units later handed their aircraft over to the 6th, 7th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 17th Fighter Divisions of the People's Liberation Army Air Force when their training was complete. The Chinese considered sending their MiG-9s to Korea in 1951 under Soviet pressure, but reconsidered when the PLAAF commanders reported <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> {{that it would be}} better to retrain MiG-9 pilots on MiG-15s.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{maintained}} an elaborate set of burial customs <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> {{were necessary to}} ensure immortality after death. These customs involved preserving the body by mummification, performing burial ceremonies, and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife. Before the Old Kingdom, bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by desiccation. The arid, desert conditions were a boon {{throughout the history of}} ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite. Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification, which involved removing the internal organs, wrapping the body in linen, and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin. Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty, some parts were preserved separately in canopic jars.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial of}} Clay Shaw {{takes place in}} 1969. Garrison {{presents}} the court with further evidence of multiple killers and dismissing the single bullet theory, and proposes a Dealey Plaza shots scenario involving three assassins who fired six total shots and framing Oswald for the murders of Kennedy and officer J. D. Tippit but the jury acquits Shaw after less than one hour of deliberation. The film reflects that members of that jury stated publicly <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> there was a conspiracy behind the assassination, but not enough evidence to link Shaw to that conspiracy. Shaw {{died of lung cancer}} in 1974, but in 1979 Richard Helms testified that Clay Shaw had been a part-time contact of the Domestic Contacts Division of the CIA. The end credits claim that records related to the assassination will be released to the public in 2029.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-four {{months into}} her captivity, the Garridos began to allow Dugard freedom from her {{handcuffs}} for periods of time, though they kept her {{locked in the}} bolted room. On April 3, 1994, Easter Sunday, they gave her cooked food for the first time. They informed her <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that she was pregnant. Age 13 and four-and-a-half months pregnant, Dugard had learned {{of the link between}} sex and pregnancy from television. At this time, while Dugard was raising her baby, Angel, Terry Probyn was holding rummage sales to pay for private investigators and distributing a million flyers across the United States featuring a sketch artist's image of a teenage Dugard. Dugard watched programs on childbirth, in preparation for the birth of her first daughter, which occurred on August 18, 1994. Her second daughter was born on November 13, 1997. Dugard took care of her daughters using information learned from television, working to protect them from Garrido, who continued his enraged rants and lectures.|$|E
