500|$|Writer James Wong was {{disappointed}} with the episode, feeling that he [...] "didn't {{do a great job}} on the script. We wanted to do a show that's all about paranoia and a conspiracy theory, but at the end I felt like we didn't really gain a lot of new ground or learn a lot of new <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we played a lot of texture instead of substance." [...] Series creator Chris Carter on the other hand claimed the episode {{was one of the most}} popular first-season episodes and thought the teaser and the scene with Mulder meeting Deep Throat at a shark tank were memorable. He also praised Jerry Hardin's performance in the episode, finding that he lent the show the [...] "believability" [...] that it needed.|$|E

[...] He continued, [...] "When I say <b>things,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> people believe me so much that they take it a different way — it's, like, not rap anymore at that point. I say some great things about him in the book I have coming out [...] — that's wasn't a cheap plug," [...] he laughed. [...] "He's gonna be embarrassed, I said some really great things about him and people's perception of him. But it is what it is, he took it that wrong way, and I didn't know I said anything wrong!" ...|$|E
500|$|Burt {{is shown}} to have deeply loved his first wife, Kurt's mother, a strong woman who died eight {{years prior to the}} premiere of the show. He later characterizes his life after losing her as [...] "being asleep". Kurt {{introduces}} him to Carole Hudson, Finn's widowed mother, and they begin dating. He falls in love with her and she with him: he tells Finn that she is an [...] "angel who came down to wake me up after all these years". At Carole's behest, Burt becomes something of a father figure to Finn, taking him to ball games, though this development does not sit well with Kurt, who works to win his father's attention back from Finn by emulating his father's dress and interests before Burt realizes how hurt Kurt is. The relationship between Burt and Carole progresses {{to the point that they}} decide to live together, and she and Finn move in with the Hummels, since their house is the larger of the two. However, after Finn uses a homophobic slur against Kurt, Burt tells Finn that his behavior is unacceptable and he cannot live in the house any more, imperiling his romance with Carole. Following his appearance in this episode, O'Malley spoke of future reconciliation between Burt and Finn. He stated, [...] "One of the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is really important in life and for human beings is to forgive and be able to rise up from our mistakes. I'm hoping that Finn and Burt are able to cross that chasm." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1982 the Cure {{recorded}} and released Pornography, {{the third and}} final album of an [...] "oppressively dispirited" [...] trio that cemented the Cure's stature as purveyors of the emerging gothic rock genre. Smith has said that during the recording of Pornography he was [...] "undergoing a lot of mental stress. But {{it had nothing to do}} with the group, it just had to do with what I was like, my age and <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I got to my worst round about Pornography. Looking back and getting other people's opinions of what went on, I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time". Gallup described the album by saying, [...] "Nihilism took over [...] We sang 'It doesn't matter if we all die' and that is exactly what we thought at the time." [...] Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track [...] "The Hanging Garden" [...] for release as a single. Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, Pornography became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight. The release of Pornography was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, where the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their signature look of big, towering hair and smeared lipstick on their faces. The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour's conclusion. Gallup and Smith did not talk to each other for eighteen months following his departure.|$|E
500|$|In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull, a post he held {{until his}} death. Professor R.L. Brett, who was {{chairman}} of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, [...] "At first I was impressed with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again." [...] For his first year he lodged in bedsits. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a self-contained flat on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate. This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem High Windows. Of the city itself Larkin commented: [...] "I never thought about Hull until I was here. Having got here, it suits me in many ways. It is a little on the edge of <b>things,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> even its natives would say that. I rather like being on the edge of things. One doesn't really go anywhere by design, you know, you put in for jobs and move about, you know, I've lived in other places." [...] In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after Sir Brynmor Jones, the university's vice-chancellor.|$|E

2500|$|At {{his first}} press conference as President-elect, Obama was {{questioned}} by reporters {{as to which}} breed the family was looking to acquire; he replied, [...] "We have two criteria {{that have to be}} reconciled. One is that Malia is allergic, so it has to be hypoallergenic. There are a number of breeds that are hypoallergenic. On the other hand, our preference would be to get a shelter dog, but, obviously, a lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me. So – so whether we're {{going to be able to}} balance those two <b>things,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> is a pressing issue on the Obama household." ...|$|E

Things would be worse than what they are today." ...|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Shermer, who {{considers}} himself {{an admirer of}} Rand, has tempered his judgment. Contrasting Leonard Peikoff's [...] "heavy-hammer approach" [...] with the [...] "big-tent approach" [...] of The Atlas Society, Shermer told Ed Hudgins: [...] "If we're close enough {{on the same page}} about many <b>things,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's more useful to cut people some slack, rather than going after them on some smaller points. I don't see the advantage of saying, 'You shouldn't have liked that movie because ultimately, if you were an Objectivist, you wouldn't have.' I guess it was those sorts of judgments made by some Objectiv that I objected to." ...|$|E

However, never one to back down, Rolo then added the ambiguous [...] "Pigs are definitely not Kosher" [...] and the less ambiguous [...] "Support honest police, they both need you". He stated the Police harassment made him more determined to continue his antics. [...] "I left Argentina because it is run by a police-military fascist regime.

Jimi Hendrix could play the guitar like crazy, but Chris had the song-writing chops that we all sort of hoped to get to {{at different points in}} our songwriting careers. He had a way he could wrap a melody around odd time signatures and weird parts and make them catchy. He was a beautiful wordsmith. If you look at his lyrics, he obviously was processing his pain and depression, and all of those <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s part of what people, myself included, responded to when he was singing. With the songwriting he had that voice, there’s not too many people that have that many options with their voice. He could do {{a lot of different things}} with it, and have a lot of different characters in that voice. I feel so lucky that I got to be in a project with him, got to hang out with him, and just sort of witness his greatness." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Williams was nine, {{her family}} and she moved from Compton to West Palm Beach, Florida, {{so that she could}} attend the tennis academy of Rick Macci; Macci began to provide {{additional}} coaching. Macci did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that [...] "he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls". Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, since he wanted them to take it slow and focus on school work. Experiences of racism also drove this experience, as Richard Williams had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments. At that time, Williams had a 46–3 record on the United States Tennis Association junior tour and was ranked number one among under-10 players in Florida. In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and, from then on, took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether having followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit would have been beneficial, Williams responded: [...] "Everyone does different <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> for Venus and I, we just attempted a different road, and it worked for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Black Cat" [...] has {{influenced}} {{the production of}} numerous songs and inspired various artists to foray into the rock genre. Record producer RedOne was inspired by [...] "Black Cat" [...] for several songs on Nicole Scherzinger's debut album, Killer Love. Jessica Simpson considers the song an influence, saying [...] "Janet's music rocks," [...] citing [...] "Black Cat" [...] and [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] specifically, adding [...] "Janet affects my music." [...] Fefe Dobson said the song was a primary influence for her third album Joy, saying [...] "I heard Janet’s ‘Black Cat,’ with its rock guitar riff. That’s what this album reflects." [...] Dobson explained, “Black Cat” incorporated a bunch {{of different types of}} music into one song. It was pop. It was punk. It was rock and roll. And I am all of those <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it hit me as a kid really hard, because I love to experience a fusion of musical genres." [...] Mexican singer Selena cited Jackson among her main influences; with Chris Pérez stating, [...] "Selena especially loved Jackson's song [...] "Black Cat" ... I can't even count how many times Selena and I listened to that single." [...] Solange Knowles also called the song an influence, saying, [...] "I remember I had a solo dance for a song of hers called 'Black Cat', and that was the start of my Janet love affair," [...] wearing a black unitard and cat ears. [...] Rihanna's single [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] was considered reminiscent of Jackson's pursuit, and she also worked with Nuno Bettencourt, the guitarist on the single edit of [...] "Black Cat," [...] during the song's live performances. Alanis Morissette's transition from dance-pop into alternative rock with Jagged Little Pill was partially inspired by the song, with author Paul Cantin writing, [...] "She may have been a fan of dance music, but when the band covered Janet Jackson's rock-flavoured song [...] "Black Cat," [...] her bandmates could see how eager she was to let go." [...] Singer-songwriter BJ the Chicago Kid cited Jackson's performance on the Rhythm Nation World Tour as an inspiration to enter the music industry, saying [...] "I remember seeing the Black Cat tour with Janet Jackson as a kid. They were wheeling a cage out on stage and there’s a black panther in there! I’m like a kid in the photographers pit like, ‘Woah.' She’s beautiful and I’m seeing a real live fucking cat..
