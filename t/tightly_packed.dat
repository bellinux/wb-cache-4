5|$|As {{a result}} of erosion of {{sandstone}} and the erosion-resistant sills and dikes, the topography in Minnesota has repeated parallel hills and valleys. The <b>tightly</b> <b>packed</b> lakes in the narrow valleys are long and narrow, and they orient from the east to west. The cliffs in these narrow valleys are the habitat to several rare plants which prefer living in narrow cliff areas in a sub-Arctic climate. In Ontario the Rove Formation is overlain by a thick diabase cap.|$|E
5|$|Everybody {{had thought}} St. Paul's Cathedral a safe refuge, with its thick stone walls and natural {{firebreak}} {{in the form}} of a wide, empty surrounding plaza. It had been crammed full of rescued goods and its crypt filled with the <b>tightly</b> <b>packed</b> stocks of the printers and booksellers in adjoining Paternoster Row. However, an enormous stroke of bad luck meant that the building was covered in wooden scaffolding, undergoing piecemeal restoration by a relatively unknown Christopher Wren. The scaffolding caught fire on Tuesday night.|$|E

5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are bright {{yellowish}} orange. Ascospores are smooth, elliptical, and typically measure 20–25 by 12–16µm. Asci (spore-bearing cells) are eight-spored, cylindrical, hyaline (translucent), and measure 225–325 by 15–22.5µm. Paraphyses are septate, and cylindrical with tips that are rounded to club-shaped, and measure 150–275 by 7–15µm. Hyphal cells on sterile ridges are septate, measuring 100–175 by 10–25µm. They are <b>tightly</b> <b>packed</b> {{in an even}} layer. The terminal hyphae are club-shaped to somewhat rectangular with a flattened to broadly rounded tip.|$|E
5|$|A {{topographic}} map {{shows that the}} majority of the interconnected complex of <b>tightly</b> <b>packed</b> lakes with their valley-and-ridge landscape is primarily in Minnesota; the border of the landscape is the Canada–US border. This border is composed of the Pigeon River, and these Rove Formation lakes (going east to west): South Fowl, North Fowl, Moose, Mountain, Watap, Rose, South, Little North and Gunflint. The border runs approximately through the center of the lengths of these lakes. The only Rove-typical east-west oriented lakes lying in Ontario are Arrow and North lakes.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies {{arise from}} the tips or the lateral {{branches}} or rhizomorphs. New fruit bodies are made of an exterior of thick hyphae {{similar to those found}} in the rhizomorph core; in contrast, the hyphae of the interior originate from the puffball's core. Unlike some other puffball species, the peridium does not differentiate into a distinct exoperidium and endoperidium; rather, the outer layer develops the features of a pseudoparenchyma (a tightly organised tissue where the <b>tightly</b> <b>packed</b> cells resemble plant parenchyma) as the radial and tangential hyphae become interweaved. In time, the peridium dries and falls off in flakes to expose the underlying gleba.|$|E
50|$|This {{ability to}} tighten or more <b>tightly</b> <b>pack</b> a pulse of light of {{different}} wavelengths is important, because some commonly used optical elements naturally disperse {{a packet of}} light according to wavelength, a phenomenon known as chromatic dispersion. A chirped mirror can be designed {{to compensate for the}} chromatic dispersion created by other optical elements in a system.|$|R

This series was labeled AP-1 through about AP-40 and pressed on grainless red vinyl. By very <b>tightly</b> <b>packing</b> the fine groove, a playing time of 17 minutes per side was achieved. Within {{a couple of years}} Audiophile switched to 33 1/3.|$|R
5|$|The pseudoparenchymatous layer (a {{layer of}} thin-walled, usually angular, {{randomly}} arranged {{cells that are}} <b>tightly</b> <b>packed)</b> is initially beige, later brownish, in age dark brown, cracked and if moist reddish brown. The fibrous layer is beige-colored, with its outer side free from the mycelial layer except at {{the tips of the}} rays. The mycelial layer has a beige brown to somewhat yellowish-brown, felted to tufted outer surface, darkening to reddish-brown if moist. It is not encrusted with debris, but some debris and sand may adhere. The inner side is smooth, dull to somewhat glossy, and hazelnut brown.|$|E
5|$|The sharptooth houndshark is a stout-bodied {{species with}} a short, thick, and blunt snout. The {{nostrils}} are widely spaced and preceded by lobe-like flaps of skin {{that do not}} reach the mouth. The horizontally oval eyes have ridges underneath and are equipped with nictitating membranes. The large mouth bears long, deep furrows at the corners, with those on the lower jaw almost meeting in the middle. The teeth are small and <b>tightly</b> <b>packed</b> to form pavement-like surfaces. Each tooth has a rounded, molar-like base that rises to a sharp, upright central cusp; rarely, a pair of barely developed lateral cusplets may also be present. There are five pairs of gill slits.|$|E
5|$|Hibs enjoyed {{great success}} in the period {{immediately}} {{after the end of}} the Second World War, winning three league championships between 1948 and 1952. The club's participation in the (inaugural) 1955–56 European Cup meant that Easter Road became the first British ground to host European Cup football. A record attendance of 65,860 was set by an Edinburgh derby against Hearts played on 2 January 1950. This is also a record for any football match played in Edinburgh. As the fans had been <b>tightly</b> <b>packed</b> on the terraces to achieve this record attendance, the size of the East Terrace was increased further. The club even drew up plans to expand the overall capacity to nearly 100,000. This would have been done by raising each end terrace to the same height as the east side, but these plans were never realised.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} {{properly}} designed mantle cloaks, consisting of patterned metallic sheets placed around cylindrical monopoles, allow <b>tightly</b> <b>packing</b> the same antennas {{together in a}} highly dense telecommunication platform. Our experimental demonstration {{is applied to the}} relevant example of two cylindrical monopole radiators operating for 3 G and 4 G mobile communications. The two antennas are placed in close proximity, separated by 1 / 10 of the shorter operational wavelength, and, after cloaking, are shown to remarkably operate as if isolated in free-space. This result paves the way to unprecedented co-siting strategies for multiple antennas handling different services and installed in overcrowded platforms, such as communication towers, satellite payloads, aircrafts, or ship trees. More broadly, this work presents a significant application of cloaking technology to improve the efficiency of modern communication systems...|$|R

40|$|Hemangiomas are {{the most}} common benign liver masses with a {{frequency}} of 0. 4 - 7. 3 % at autopsy. They are usually discovered incidentally and a few require surgery. Spontaneous or traumatic ruptures are among indications of surgery for hemangiomas. We report a case of giant hepatic hemangioma presenting as hemoperitoneum following use of the slimming belt that underwent an emergent laparotomy. Abdominal exploration revealed that both right and left lobes of the liver were involved with giant hemangiomas. The liver was compressed by <b>tightly</b> <b>packing</b> laparotomy pads. After the operation, the patient was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit. Two days later, a second surgery was performed to remove the laparotomy pads.

5|$|Several {{types of}} {{ammunition}} were available, each for different uses: round shot (cannonballs) against ship hulls, chain shot against masts and rigging, and canister shot (wooden cylinders filled with metal balls or fragments), {{which had a}} devastating effect on <b>tightly</b> <b>packed</b> groups of men. For boarding actions Kronan was equipped with 130 muskets and 80 matchlock or flintlock pistols. For close combat there were 250 pikes, 200 boarding axes and 180 swords. During the excavations, large-caliber firearms were found – hakebössor, similar to blunderbusses; they were equipped with a small catch underneath the barrel which allowed them to be hooked over a railing {{to allow it to}} absorb the recoil of the charges. One hakebössa was still loaded with a small canister containing 20 lead balls that would have been used to clear enemy decks before boarding.|$|E
5|$|Another pitfall trap form {{unrelated}} to the Sarraceniaceae family are the urns of bromeliad leaves that are formed when leaves are <b>tightly</b> <b>packed</b> together in a rosette, collecting water and trapping insects. Unlike Brocchinia reducta, which has been proven to produce at least one digestive enzyme and can therefore be considered carnivorous, the epiphytic Catopsis berteroniana has little evidence supporting the claims that it is carnivorous. It is able to attract and kill prey and the trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves can absorb nutrients, but so far no enzyme activity has been detected. It may be that this plant also relies on an internal food web for soft tissue digestion. The same could be said for Paepalanthus bromelioides, though it is a member of Eriocaulaceae and not a bromeliad. It also forms a central water reservoir that has adaptations to attract insects. It, like C. berteroniana, produces no digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius sasicola {{produces}} colourless, ellipsoid basidiospores {{of between}} 8 and 10 by 4 to 6micrometres (μm). The spores have no ornamentation, are not amyloid and have thin cell walls. In his examinations, Takahashi did not observe any basidia, {{but he did}} describe the club-shaped basidioles (immature basidia) which measured from 18 to 26 by 6 to 10μm. The <b>tightly</b> <b>packed</b> cheilocystidia (cystidia {{on the edge of}} the gill) form a sterile edge to the gill, and there are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the face of the gill). The pileipellis, the top layer of the cap, forms a hymeniderm, a cell structure reminiscent of the hymenium on the gills. This is made up of club-shaped cells measuring between 2 and 8 by 7 to 10μm, with reddish-brown, smooth cell walls up to 1μm thick. The stipitipellis, the outermost layer of the stem, is made up of cylindrical hyphae measuring from 3 to 6μm in width, which run parallel to one another. They have featureless brown cell walls measuring up to 1μm thick, and the septa (the walls separating individual cells) have clamp connections.|$|E
40|$|International audienceMotion blur {{is crucial}} for {{high-quality}} rendering but is also very expensive. Our first contribution is a frequency analysis of motion-blurred scenes, including moving objects, specular reflections, and shadows. We show that motion induces a shear in the frequency domain, and that the spectrum of moving scenes is usually contained in a wedge. This allows us to compute adaptive space-time sampling rates, to accelerate rendering. For uniform velocities and standard axis-aligned reconstruction, we show that the product of spatial and temporal bandlimits or sampling rates is constant, independent of velocity. Our second contribution is a novel sheared reconstruction filter that <b>tightly</b> <b>packs</b> the wedge of frequencies in the Fourier domain, and enables even lower sampling rates. We present a rendering algorithm that computes a sheared reconstruction filter per pixel, without any intermediate Fourier representation. This often permits synthesis of motion-blurred images with far fewer rendering samples than standard techniques require...|$|R

5|$|As the {{situation}} for the Swedish army in Pomerania deteriorated {{during the winter of}} 1675–76, the fleet, with Kronan as flagship, was ordered to sea again {{in a desperate attempt to}} relieve the hard-pressed Swedish land forces. The weather was unusually cold and large parts of the Baltic were iced in. The fleet, now under the command of the seasoned sea officer Claes Uggla, was blocked by ice when it reached Dalarö on 23 January. The Privy Councilor Erik Lindschöld had been assigned by the King to assist with the expedition, and he came up with the idea of cutting the fleet out of the ice to reach the open sea. Hundreds of local peasants were ordered out to open a narrow channel through the ice with saws and picks to the anchorage at Älvsnabben, more than 20km (12mi) away. On reaching the naval station on 14 February, three weeks later, it turned out that most of the sea outside the inner skerries was frozen as well. A storm hit the <b>tightly</b> <b>packed</b> ships and the ensuing movement of the ice crushed the hull of the supply vessel Leoparden, sinking it. A Danish force had managed to reach the open waters farther off and observed the immobilized Swedish ships from a distance. When temperatures fell even further, the project was declared hopeless and Lindschöld gave up the attempt.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean ground troops, {{unprepared}} for the aggressive use of US air power and untrained in countering it, continued to operate <b>tightly</b> <b>packed</b> convoys on open roads, allowing the US air forces to attack and ravage them repeatedly. From July 7 to 9, an estimated 197 trucks and 44 T-34 tanks were destroyed between Seoul and Pyongtaek. Though they subsequently won ground engagements at the Battle of Pyongtaek and Battle of Chonan, the North Korean ground troops were taking heavy losses from US air forces. On a few occasions, the UN airpower made mistakes, such as a July 3 bombing by No. 77 Squadron RAAF that hit a South Korean convoy near Suwon. At the same time, UN aircraft began flying at higher altitudes because combined small arms fire from North Korean ground targets was taking a heavier toll on UN aircraft. By mid July, these aircraft were flying up to 200 sorties a day to support UN ground troops, who by this point were losing the Battle of Chochiwon and the Battle of Taejon. By {{the start of the}} Battle of Pusan Perimeter, the air battle for South Korea had been won by the UN, and it used its air superiority decisively to its advantage during that battle. The UN would remain unopposed in the skies until the Chinese forces entered the war in November of that year.|$|E
5|$|Food {{preservation}} methods were {{basically the same}} as had been used since antiquity, and did not change much until the invention of canning in the early 19th century. The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove moisture, thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water-dependent microorganisms that cause decay. In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun, and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds (especially common for the preparation of stockfish), or in warm ovens, cellars, attics, and at times even in living quarters. Subjecting food {{to a number of}} chemical processes such as smoking, salting, brining, conserving or fermenting also made it keep longer. Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors. Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in autumn was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months. Butter tended to be heavily salted (5–10%) in order not to spoil. Vegetables, eggs or fish were also often pickled in <b>tightly</b> <b>packed</b> jars, containing brine and acidic liquids (lemon juice, verjuice or vinegar). Another method was to seal the food by cooking it in sugar or honey or fat, in which it was then stored. Microbial modification was also encouraged, however, by a number of methods; grains, fruit and grapes were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any pathogens, and milk was fermented and curdled into a multitude of cheeses or buttermilk.|$|E

5|$|The ontogeny, or development, of Mycena stylobates fruit bodies {{has been}} {{investigated}} in detail using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. According to Volker Walther and colleagues, the development {{can be divided into}} two phases: in the first, the primordium is established that contains all the structures of the mature fruit body; in the second stage, the primordial stipe elongates rapidly, and the newly exposed hymenium immediately begins spore production. The first detected stage of fruit body formation was an irregularly arranged hyphal structure within the colonized substrate. After rupturing the surface of the substrate and establishing itself there, the structure develops a layer of wrapping hyphae that covers the entire primordium. The structures of the stipe and the cap develop simultaneously. The developing stipe, cap, and basal disc together form a secondary ring-like cavity, in which the gills develop. Gill development initiates with a number of small alveolae on the lower side of the cap, which are covered with a hymenophoral palisade (a group of <b>tightly</b> <b>packed,</b> roughly parallel cells). The margins of these alveolae form the primary gills. The hymenophoral palisade spreads from the developing alveolae to the gill edge; the edge of the primary gills is forked {{in the early stages of}} its development. The secondary gills (lamellulae) are formed by the ridges folding down from the lower side of the cap. In contrast to the primary gills, they are covered with hymenophoral palisade from the beginning. Spore production begins immediately after the stipe elongates.|$|E

Obtained high-resolution clearly confirms a helical character of a protein and its complex with a diagnostic ligand in solution.
