25|$|In {{the same}} way, Stewart centers {{the first half}} of Earth Abides on the forces of natural and {{artificial}} selection. In freeing the landscape from humans, half of the book is devoted to looking at how the world would change in their absence. Stewart chose to make his main human character an ecologist, and sends him on a cross-country tour, to see what the world is like without people. As animals and plants no longer have humans <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> or controlling them, they are free to breed uncontrolled and to prey upon one another. The main character sees that some have been under humans so long that they are helpless in the face of change, while others are still able to adapt and survive. Stewart shows that humans have routinely influenced the lives of almost every plant and animal around them.|$|E

[...] The focus target market for medical tourists in Malta is the United Kingdom, followed by North Africa, the Middle East, Russia and North America. Part {{of the reason for}} targeting the United Kingdom for medical tourists is that many members of Malta's medical profession were trained in the United Kingdom, increasing the confidence of British patients in those <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> In addition, unlike some medical tourism destinations, Malta has a stable political climate. The Maltese government supports the development of medical tourism on the island but believes that private medical providers should be performing medical procedures, not government-run facilities.|$|E
500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin {{was clearly}} Stowe's magnum opus (although she {{considered}} Old Town Folks, {{which was written}} {{while she was in}} Mandarin, to have that designation), as Stowe family history recalls that Abraham Lincoln entertained the author during a visit to the White House, and greeted her by saying [...] "So this is the little lady who made this big war?" [...] Compared to it, Palmetto Leaves is considered a minor work and is rarely included in the canon of criticism about Stowe's writings. The Cambridge Introduction to Literature series on Stowe addresses it briefly, however, noting that the mixed essay and letter format make it [...] "uneven in quality and unstable in stance". More assertive criticism was directed toward Stowe's portrayals of the local Mandarin blacks. Cambridge Introduction to Literature author Sarah Robbins called it [...] "downright offensive" [...] and declared that Stowe negated her own attempts to persuade her readers that emancipated slaves were industrious and could assist in rebuilding the South of their own volition by including unflattering descriptions of their physical features—comparing Old Cudjo to a baboon, for example—and writing that supervising and <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> was necessary. Susan Eacker agrees, writing that Stowe's views were representative of the majority of white Americans' ideas of where blacks should be in the social scheme of the New South.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Cardiac surgery {{has many}} physiological, psychological, emotional, growth and spiritual {{potential}} consequences due to stress. Identifying {{and understanding the}} nature of stress can help nurses in controlling and reducing it. However, {{few studies have been}} conducted to identify the stressors. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} determine nurses' perceptions of patients' stressors associated with coronary artery bypass surgery. Methods: During a two month investigation, qualified nurses (n = 68) of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass were selected on the third to fifth day after surgery. With the use of Revised Cardiac Surgery Stressors Scale (RCSSS), interpersonal, intrapersonal and extrapersonal stressors were determined. Results: The findings showed that the most interpersonal, intrapersonal and extrapersonal stressors were; “the need to have cardiac surgery”, “death due to illness or surgery”, “needing assistance with various activities”, “doctors and nurses discussing about other patients”, “having chest tube” and “Payment of hospital and medical bills”. Conclusion: Identification of stressors in patients with coronary artery bypass graft helps nurses in <b>taking</b> better <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> It would make a better ground for the officials and practitioners towards managing the stressors, especially interpersonal and extrapersonal stressors. Thereby patients are helped to cope with stressors...|$|R

She began touring in 1919 with a production of Birds in Paradise, which brought the Hawaiian culture to the mainland, and, in 1921, began work with the Stuart Walker Company, for which she played roles in Mr. Pim Passes By, The Ruined Lady, and Rollo's Wild Oats, among others. [...] This connection landed her a role in her first Broadway performance in 1924, George S. Kaufman and Marc Connelly's Beggar on Horseback which ran for six months. She renewed the role in March and April 1925, and continued on Broadway with an additional 18 productions in the ten years from 1925 to 1935. These included roles in Kaufman and Moss Hart's Once in a Lifetime, Rachel Crothers's When Ladies Meet, and Dawn Powell's Jig Saw.|$|E

Following Sylvia's death in 1910, Barrie claimed that they had recently been engaged to be married. Her will indicated nothing to that effect, but specified her wish for [...] "J. M. B."

It expressed her confidence in Barrie as the boys' caretaker and her wish for [...] "the boys to treat him (& their uncles) with absolute confidence & straightforwardness & {{to talk to him about}} everything." [...] When copying the will informally for Sylvia's family a few months later, Barrie inserted himself elsewhere: Sylvia had written that she would like Mary Hodgson, the boys' nurse, to continue <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> and for [...] "Jenny" [...] (referring to Hodgson's sister) to come and help her; Barrie instead wrote [...] "Jimmy" [...] (Sylvia's nickname for him).

Virtous people used to visit the temple to gather religious merit {{and get back to}} their home. Millions of Hindu religious people would take bath at Langolbondon on the month of Choitra on Sukla Ostomi time to get rid of their sins. People in huge numbers used to come to Dhakeswari temple on foot from different roads to be blessed by the deity Durga. It was the best moment of their whole year. With great hope they would come out from their home, and it was reflected on their faces, to get rid of their sins by worshiping the Deity with exclusive devotion and bowing their head to meditation of Bhagaban. They forget about everything- hunger, sleep, restlessness – and they just believe that they will be blessed and they step up for the temple. All those people were divided into small groups with each group having ten to twenty people. The groups consisted of mainly women, only one man, who is the oldest of the village, was there for <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> They came from very long distance by forming groups. People of different ages, including the oldest and skinniest, were also gathered with these groups.

Trees and stand densities constitute a significant {{element of the}} landscape (both in urban and rural areas) and serve a number of ecosystem functions, forming an inherent part of each group of benefits singled out {{on the basis of}} the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. In the thesis, selected ecosystem services of trees and stand densities were detailed - provisioning, regulatory, supporting and cultural functions. Diagnosis of services performed by trees and their valuation may contribute to <b>taking</b> increased <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and protection during performing various investments, it is therefore appropriate to launch multifaceted ecological education to each person, particularly to those directly responsible for trees and bushes in towns and rural areas. In order to restrict construction stress to trees and bushes, environmental impact assessment has to be made as soon as the construction planning is being made (natural, cultural and landscape conditions should be provided additionally), it is advisable to conduct a dendrological inventory for planning purposes. Appropriate protection of trees and standing densities is also legally regulated by the Nature Conservation Act and the Construction Law. During the investment process, the trees and their settlement conditions should be adequately secured, so that it will not affect their viability. After completed investment, the condition of the tree stand should be monitored...|$|R

One of his conclusions was that morality is more often found among members of large families than among those of small ones. It is reasonable to expect this would be the case owing to the internal discipline among members of large families, and to the wholesome sustaining and restraining effects of family pride and family criticism. Members of small families are apt to be selfish, and when the smallness of the family is due to the deaths of many of its members at early ages, it is some evidence either of weakness of the family constitution, or of deficiency of common sense or of affection {{on the part of the}} parents in not <b>taking</b> better <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Mr. Holland quotes in his letter to me a piece of advice by Franklin to a young man in search of a wife, [...] "to take one out of a bunch of sisters," [...] and a popular saying that kittens brought up with others make the best pets, because they have learned to play without scratching.
