5|$|Franklin asked Timothy Folger, {{his cousin}} twice removed (Nantucket Historical Society), a Nantucket Island whaling captain, for an answer.

Franklin worked with Folger and other experienced ship captains, learning enough to chart the Gulf Stream and giving it the name by which it is still known <b>today.</b> <b>He</b> offered this information to Anthony Todd, secretary of the British Post Office, but it was ignored by British sea captains.|$|E

5|$|After his MVP season, Killebrew {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with the Twins worth $90,000 ($ <b>today).</b> <b>He</b> was set to lead a team that had undergone a lot of change; Killebrew {{was one of only}} four Twins remaining from the 1965 pennant-winning club. He spent most of the season's first half continuing his success, and found Baltimore's Brooks Robinson rivalling him for the third base spot during the All-Star voting process; the two were neck-and-neck throughout. He continued his success through {{the second half of the}} year, and at season's end Killebrew had hit 41 home runs with 113 RBIs and finished third in MVP voting behind teammate Tony Oliva and Baltimore's Boog Powell, who won the award. The Twins again faced Powell and the Orioles in the 1970 American League Championship Series, a rematch of the previous season.

5|$|Through his {{magazines}} and books, Robinson challenged many gardening traditions and introduced new ideas {{that have become}} commonplace <b>today.</b> <b>He</b> is most linked with introducing the herbaceous border, which he referred to by the older name of 'mixed border'—it included a mixture of shrubs, hardy and half-hardy herbaceous plants. He also advocated dense plantings that left no bare soil, with the spaces between taller plants filled with what are now commonly called ground cover plants. Even his rose garden at Gravetye was filled with saxifrage between and under the roses. Following {{a visit to the}} Alps, Robinson wrote Alpine Flowers for Gardens, which for the first time showed how to use alpine plants in a designed rock garden.|$|E
5|$|In 1872, at {{the urging}} of many of his friends, {{including}} Darwin, Philip Sclater, and Alfred Newton, Wallace began research for a general review of the geographic distribution of animals. He was unable to make much progress initially, in part because classification systems for many types of animals were in flux at the time. He resumed the work in earnest in 1874 after the publication of a number of new works on classification. Extending the system developed by Sclater for birds—which divided the earth into six separate geographic regions for describing species distribution—to cover mammals, reptiles and insects as well, Wallace created the basis for the zoogeographic regions still in use <b>today.</b> <b>He</b> discussed all of the factors then known to influence the current and past geographic distribution of animals within each geographical region. These included the effects of the appearance and disappearance of land bridges (such as the one currently connecting North America and South America) and the effects of periods of increased glaciation. He provided maps that displayed factors, such as elevation of mountains, depths of oceans, and the character of regional vegetation, that affected the distribution of animals. He also summarised all the known families and genera of the higher animals and listed their known geographic distributions. The text was organised so that it would be easy for a traveller to learn what animals could be found in a particular location. The resulting two-volume work, The Geographical Distribution of Animals, was published in 1876 and would serve as the definitive text on zoogeography for the next 80 years.|$|E
5|$|The BS {{struggled}} {{on for a}} time, {{funding the}} construction work by making calls on the unpaid portion of its shares, but activity eventually {{came to a stop}} and the partly built tunnels were left derelict. Before its collapse, the L attempted to sell its interests in the BS for £500,000 to an American consortium headed by Albert L. Johnson, but was unsuccessful. However, it attracted the interest of another American consortium headed by financier Charles Yerkes. After some months of negotiations with the L's liquidator, Yerkes purchased the company for £360,000 plus interest (£ <b>today).</b> <b>He</b> was involved in the development of Chicago's tramway system in the 1880s and 1890s. He came to London in 1900 and purchased a number of the struggling underground railway companies, The BS became a subsidiary of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) which Yerkes formed to raise funds to build the tube railways and to electrify the District Railway. The UERL was capitalised at £5million with the majority of shares sold to overseas investors. Further share issues followed, which raised a total of £18million by 1903 (equivalent to approximately £ today) for use across all of the UERL's projects.|$|E
