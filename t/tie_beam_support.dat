Both transepts are separated from the nave by c.20th-century panels and doors rising part {{way to the top}} of the arches. The north transept is solid panelling; the south with clear glazed doors to its full width. The north transept is today used as the church vestry room, and the south transept a meeting room with modern furniture. On the south wall of the south transept is a 14th-century piscina with a recessed trefoiled head, a re-cut quatrefoil drain, a head of a woman in a wimple carved at its apex, and a finial above.|$|E

All flooring is plain red tiling {{except on the}} raised chancel sanctuary behind the altar rail where there is added bands of black, white and brown. The chancel east window {{is part of the}} 19th-century restoration, but {{with the use of a}} c. 1270 capital detail. The c. 1270 chamfered rebated chancel arch has a hood mould finished with human head label stops on both chancel and nave sides. Set within the arch is a further chamfered arch supported by responds - half-piers attached to walls supporting an arch - of semi-circular columns with flat-face faceted moulded bases, and foliate capitals that have been part-restored. A 19th-century-added arched squint is on each side of the chancel arch, each with a chamfered rebate as part of the arch. Set above each squint on the chancel side is a gable as moulding with, at its spring and point, a carved foliated detail. Within the chancel is a 14th-century piscina containing a quatrefoil shaped drain.The north transept (or Priory End) windows, east and north, are 19th century but within 14th-century openings.

This vestibule, an extension of the nave, is separated from it by an ornamental timber screen. Decorative timber screens also define the entries from the transept into the nave. The interior of the church, furnished with the original timber pews, is lined with unpainted cedar and has a coloured concrete floor. The raked timber lined ceiling, truncated at the peak, is supported on timber trusses that are a combination of a queen and king post system. The bottom chord of the trusses is a heavy <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> <b>supported</b> on timber wall brackets.|$|R
50|$|A crown post {{is a term}} in {{traditional}} timber framing for a post in roof framing which stands on a <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> or collar <b>beam</b> and <b>supports</b> a collar plate. Historically, crown posts were called king posts, but this usage is confusing and obsolete. A crown post {{is designed to be}} in a compression and transfers weight to the <b>tie</b> <b>beam,</b> where a king post is designed to be in tension and <b>supports</b> the <b>tie</b> <b>beam.</b> In the U.K a crown strut is similar to a crown post but does not carry a plate.|$|R
500|$|The {{eastern end}} of Bristol Cathedral is highly unusual {{for a number of}} reasons. Firstly, it was {{conceived}} as a [...] "hall church", meaning that the aisles are the same height as the choir. While a feature of German Gothic architecture, this is rare in Britain, and Bristol cathedral is the most significant example. In the 19th century, G. E. Street designed the nave along the same lines. The effect of this elevation means that there are no clerestory windows to light the central space, as is usual in English Medieval churches. The north and south aisles employ a unique manner where the vaults rest on <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> style bridges <b>supported</b> by pointed arches. All the internal light must come from the aisle windows which are accordingly very large. In the choir, the very large window of the Lady chapel is made to fill the entire upper part of the wall, so that it bathes the vault in daylight, particularly in the morning.|$|R
40|$|Effects of <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> length, {{width and}} overlap stress on {{settlement}} of foundations have been inves-tigated. In this investigation square concrete footings {{have been used}} with dimensions (B × B × d) where (d) is footing depth and (B) is footing width (1, 1. 5, 2 m). Width of <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> (b) has been taken equal to 0. 25, 0. 30, 0. 40, 0. 50 and 0. 75 (m). <b>Tie</b> <b>beam</b> length (L) has been taken varying from B till 3 B with same footing depth = 0. 50 m. Effect of overlap stress on settlement as well as effect of <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> width and length on settlement has been determined. Also, the efficiency of <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> length and width has been obtained.

50|$|Lacking a <b>tie</b> <b>beam,</b> the arch-braced (arched brace) truss gives a {{more open}} look to the {{interior}} of the roof. The principal rafters are linked by a collar <b>beam</b> <b>supported</b> by a pair of arch braces, which stiffen the structure and help to transmit the weight of the roof down through the principal rafters to the supporting wall. A double arch braced truss has a second pair of arched braces lower down, from the rafter to a block or inner sill: This form is called a wagon, cradle, barrel or tunnel roof because of this cylindrical appearance.|$|R
50|$|In 1914 the <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> in the chancel was cut out and {{replaced}} by an iron rod, drawing by Inskipp Ladds, but in 1914 the vicar, Rev. John Cooper, commented that the <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> is 'a real eyesore disfiguring as it does the east window and hiding the tracery.' An additional <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> was added across the east face of the west tower.|$|R
50|$|Home Farm at the Beamish Museum, County Durham, {{contains}} an early 19th-century, semi-octagonal gin gang with sandstone or millstone grit walls and slate roof. The renovated internal roof structure {{is based on}} a traditional space frame truss with its primary plane in line with the <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> (or joist), and with members fixed between king post and rafters to support the semi-octagonal plan of the roof. There is one main transverse oak <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> on which the king post of the main truss is based. The king post is in tension to prevent sagging of the horizontal <b>tie</b> <b>beam,</b> so neither the king post nor the <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> are resting on the mill below. The roof construction is not structurally dependent on the horse mill, or connected with it.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> in a pier is demaged {{owing to}} the {{collapse}} of the bridge girder erection machine in the construction. In order to evaluate the safety of the pier stud, the effect of force induced by the impact of the collapse is analyzed. The results show that the concrete in bottom of the pier is compressed and that the tensile stress of concrete in the root of the damaged <b>tie</b> <b>beam</b> is less that the designed tensile strength of the concrte. The analyzed results are in line with the real state of the damaged <b>tie</b> <b>beam...</b>|$|R

Five bents support {{the roof and}} walls; the two on {{the north and south}} ends support the studwork for the clapboard siding and entrance framing. They are braced twice: at the intersection of the post and <b>tie</b> <b>beams,</b> and again above the <b>tie</b> <b>beam.</b> Both upper and lower ties are connected to the anchor beams by mortise joints and pegs. A purlin-plate runs {{across the top of the}} bents, also mortised and braced. Below the <b>tie</b> <b>beams</b> another set of longitudinal braces links the bents, parallel to the purlin-plates.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental and numerical {{investigation of the}} structural behaviour of reinforcement-free concrete bridge deck slabs. In the proposed deck structure, a novel load carrying mechanism is introduced to {{eliminate the need for}} internal steel reinforcement. This mechanism is a combination utilizing arching action in deck slabs and <b>tying</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>beams</b> together with fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) rods. In this study, a series of one third scale deck specimens were fabricated and tested up to failure with varying several structural parameters, including <b>supporting</b> <b>beam</b> sizes, type of edge beams and spacing of FRP restraint rods. The failure mode of concrete deck slabs under concentrated wheel loads was expected to be punching failure and arching action inside this type of laterally restrained concrete deck slab had a significant effect on the ultimate behaviour. After the comparison of the test results, the influences of these structural variables and arching action on the behaviour were evaluated. Subsequently, a nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) model was proposed to develop further study. The numerical results showed good agreement with the test results. A parametric study using this finite element model was performed to investigate the factors affecting the ultimate capacity and failure mechanism of this type of reinforcement-free bridge deck. The test results and finite element analyses are discussed and conclusions are presented...|$|R
