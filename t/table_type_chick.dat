The proximate analysis of gari showed that it has 2. 5 % crude protein, 0. 3 % ether extract and 3. 5 % crude fibre.

40|$|Abstract: A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the replacement value of dusa (Locally processed maize offal) for maize in the diets of egg <b>type</b> <b>chicks.</b> The proximate analysis and the metabolizable energy of dusa were determined. Three hundred and seventy eight (378) day-old egg <b>type</b> <b>chicks</b> were randomly allocated to seven dietary treatments containing graded levels of dusa from control to treatment seven with three replicates of 18 birds each. Feed consumption, weight gain and mortality were recorded. The proximate analysis revealed that dusa is higher in crude protein than the maize grain (10. 82 % and 8. 57 % respectively). The metabolizable energy value was however lower than for maize grain (2784 kcal kgG versus 3432 Kcal 1 kgG respectively). There was no significant difference (p> 0. 05) between treatment means for the average 1 weight gain of birds. Feed consumption and feed to gain ratio increased as the level of dusa increased in the diets. There was no mortality throughout the study. The cost (N/kg weight gain) and feed cost (N/bird) were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) for the control and they decreased as the level of dusa increased in the diets. There were significant savings in cost of production in using dusa as a source of energy in chicks’ diets. It was concluded that dusa could replace all the maize in the diets of egg <b>type</b> <b>chicks</b> without any adverse effect on the performance...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Segregations of a down-feather color variant are {{described}} in crosses of gold Columbian patterned fowl. The down-feathers {{of the head and}} neck of gold Columbian chicks are usually of the same brown-red color intensity as are the body down-feathers, whereas with this color variant, the down-feathers of the head were light buff in color, contrasting sharply with the much darker body color. From the segregation ratios, a polygenic mode of inheritance was proposed to account for the inheritance of this trait. These same genes also seemed to cause a significant intensifying effect on the postjuvenile feather phaeomelanins, which was in direct opposition to their pigment suppressing action in the down. POULTRY SCIENCE 52 : 831 - 835, 1973 T N THE domestic fowl, chicks of the * ~ gold Columbian plumage-type are gen-erally, on an individual chick basis, of a uniform dorsal surface coloration. They do differ greatly, however, in their overall intensity of feather phaeomelanin pig-mentation from one breed to another. A distinct variation of the usual uniform dorsal surface coloration was observed among the progeny from F 2 crosses be-tween three gold Columbian type breeds— Buff Orpington, New Hampshire and Rhode Island Red. The variant <b>type</b> <b>chicks,</b> to be referred to hereafter as "light, " had a light buff colored head and neck which was in marked contrast to the much darker red of the back (Figure 1). Typically, the gold Columbian <b>type</b> <b>chicks,</b> which will be referred to as "dark " here-after, had a dorsal surface coloration in which the back, neck and head were all of a uniform red intensity. This study was conducted to determine if this observed difference in head and neck coloration of gold Columbian <b>type</b> <b>chicks</b> had a heritable basis, and to deter-mine if there was any relationship between these two chick coloration phenotypes an...|$|R

In our black-white attribute tables, the value of attributes was limited to two (with a certain threshold for each attribute) and each cell of the table was colored either black or white on the white background. We compared the two natural ways of systematic color assignment: “quantitatively coherent” ways and “qualitatively coherent” ways (namely, {{the ways in which the}} black-white distinction represented the quantitative amount distinction, and the ways in which the black-white distinction represented the quality distinction). The former consists of the following two types: (Type 1) “larger is black,” where the larger value-level was represented by black, and “smaller is white,” and (Type 2) “smaller is black. ” The latter consisted of the following two types: (Type 3) “better is black,” and (Type 4) “worse is black. ” We obtained the following two findings. [Result 1] The qualitatively coherent black-white <b>tables</b> (<b>Types</b> 3 and 4) made decision-making easier than the quantitatively coherent ones (Types 1 and 2). [Result 2] Among the two qualitatively coherent types, the “black is better” <b>tables</b> (<b>Type</b> 3) made decision making easier; in fact, the participants focused on the more important (black) cells in the case of “black is better” <b>tables</b> (<b>Type</b> 3) while they did not focus enough on the more important (white) ones in the case of the “white is better” <b>tables</b> (<b>Type</b> 4).

Our method is based on solving a satisfiability problem that produces a cover for a boolean relation from a restricted set of compatible primes.
