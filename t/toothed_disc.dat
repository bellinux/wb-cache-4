5000|$|The Olds 403 {{was used}} by Buick and Pontiac in {{addition}} to Oldsmobile. The engine was only produced through 1979. Output was [...] and [...] The Toronado version of the 1977 Oldsmobile 403 engine was fitted with a crank triggered ignition system. Parts peculiar to this system include a <b>toothed</b> <b>disc</b> between the harmonic balancer and the crank pulley, the adjacent sensor (which predated the modern-day crankshaft position sensor, which Oldsmobile used with their Quad 4 in the late 1980s with a cast-in toothed section of the crankshaft), a special distributor, an engine temperature sensor, and a rudimentary computer mounted inside the car, under the dash. No other years or models were provided with this system.|$|E
50|$|In the {{simplest}} case, the stator has four poles {{and the field}} coils and armature windings are arranged alternately around the stator between the poles. The field magnets are arranged with their poles opposing each other, i.e. one armature is between the two North poles, one between the two South. The rotor is a simple <b>toothed</b> <b>disc</b> of magnetic, but unmagnetized, iron. As it rotates between poles, it links the flux between {{a single pair of}} opposing poles. The magnetic circuit of the stator is thus a pair of triangles, each containing a field, an armature and a shared path through the rotor. Flux passes in each circuit from one field and through one armature. As the rotor turns, the other triangular path is formed, switching the flux from one pair of field and armature to the other and also reversing the direction of the flux in the armature coil. It is this reversal of flux that produces the alternating emf.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} {{object is}} horizontal stirred mill, and I have studied six different Stirrer disc (including the trapezoidal tooth disc, the serrated <b>toothed</b> <b>disc,</b> the common disc, decagonal disc, the octagonal disc and the hexagonal disc) structure on the horizontal stirred mill grinding efficiency. The paper applied EDEM for six {{different forms of}} Stirrer disc simulation, analyzing the simulation results, it is concluded that: when the Stirrer disc structure is the trapezoidal tooth disc, the comprehensive performance of horizontal stirred grinding machine is best, with high grinding efficiency, low power consumption, provide a reference {{for the design of}} the Horizontal stirred mill...|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 30-46 mm. The forewings are pale brown, with a {{very few}} scattered dark fuscous scales and a broad streak {{from the base of}} the costa to beyond the middle of the <b>disc,</b> <b>toothed</b> above at one-third and beneath at two-thirds, white, edged with dark fuscous, the apical third narrow and wholly dark fuscous. The hindwings are whitish, slightly brownish-tinged.|$|R
50|$|A {{circular}} saw is a power-saw using a <b>toothed</b> or abrasive <b>disc</b> or blade to cut different materials using {{a rotary motion}} spinning around an arbor. A hole saw and ring saw also use a rotary motion but are different from a {{circular saw}}. Circular saws may also be loosely used for the blade itself. Circular saws were invented in the late 18th century and were in common use in sawmills in the United States {{by the middle of}} the 19th century.|$|R
40|$|Typical {{diffraction}} and vignetting effects {{associated to}} the use of both externally and internally occulted coronagraphs make the innermost solar corona quite unobserved. However, by increasing the distance between the coronagraph telescope and the external occulter to hundred of meters, it is possible to observe the solar corona down to 1. 01 solar radii without vignetting. This is the case of ASPIICS (Association de Satellites Pour l'Imagerie et l'Interférométrie Coronographique Solaire), a mission proposed to ESA for the PROBA 3 program for formation flying. ASPIICS foresees two satellites: the external occulter is located on one spacecraft, and the telescope on the other. In this work we present the results obtained by a theoretical analysis of the apodization of the external occulter. This technique allows the reduction of the diffracted light contribution. We have developed a code that can simulates the effects of the giant external occulter (1 m diameter) on the photospheric light, and calculates the intensity of the diffracted light on the coronagraph entrance aperture. It is possible, in this way, to analyze various shapes of the occulter edge. In particular, we have focused our attention {{in the case of the}} serrated disc with variable number of teeth of different length. We considered the simple occurrence of a point-like monochromatic source at infinity. The results show that, employing a <b>toothed</b> <b>disc,</b> improvement of the S/N ratio of many order of magnitude (whit respect to a simple circular flat disc) can be obtained...|$|E
