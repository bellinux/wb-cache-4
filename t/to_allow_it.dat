The outward transport of watercress, a major local industry, also generated significant traffic. During the electrification of the line in 1957–60 the station was equipped with a bay platform for passenger trains, <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> to accommodate both through services to and from Baker Street and the Chalfont& Latimer–Chesham shuttle simultaneously.

5|$|During the {{planning}} of Troll, which opened in 1990, {{it was decided that}} the station was to be placed at such a location as <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> to have an airstrip for year-round operations. Jutulsessen was chosen as the location, in part because it provided a base nunatak for the research station {{and at the same time}} was close to blue ice for the runway. At the time, all cargo and passengers to Troll had to either be transported by ship, or flown in via the airport at the Russian base Novolazarevskaya or Henriksenskjera.|$|E

5|$|Rossia {{returned}} to Kronstadt, arriving on 8 April 1906, {{where she was}} given a lengthy refit that was finished in 1909. Her engines and boilers were reconditioned, her mainmast was removed and she received additional six-inch guns. Six more guns in lightly armored casemates were added on the upper deck, positioned on each side in the intervals between the main-deck six-inch guns. In addition the bow gun {{was moved to the}} upper deck <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> to fire to each side. This increased the ship's broadside by four guns.|$|E

5|$|The Navy, however, {{still had}} a {{requirement}} for a ship capable of defeating enemy cruisers and the original concept was revived as Project 69. The proposed size of the ship continually escalated as the requirement was revised <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> to fight larger ships like the German s. The preliminary design was finally approved in January 1939 and two ships were laid down in November 1939, before the detailed design had even been approved.|$|E
5|$|The Prince of Wales – {{the future}} Edward VIII – was keen to {{participate}} in the war but the government refused <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>it,</b> citing the immense harm that would occur if the heir to the throne were captured. Despite this, Edward witnessed trench warfare at first hand and attempted to visit the front line as often as he could, for which he was awarded the Military Cross in 1916. His role in the war, although limited, led to his great popularity among veterans of the conflict.|$|E

5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of the reactors to DuPont. There was friction between the company and Wigner and his team. Major differences between Wigner's reactor design and DuPont's included {{increasing the number of}} process tubes from 1,500 in a circular array to 2,004 in a square array, and cutting the power from 500 MW to 250 MW. As it turned out, the design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional tubes came in handy when neutron poisoning became a problem for the B Reactor at the Hanford Site. The extra tubes allowed a greater fuel load to overcome the poisoning. Without them the reactor would have had to be run at low power until enough of the boron impurities in the graphite had been burned up <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> to reach full power, which would have delayed full operation by up to a year.|$|E
