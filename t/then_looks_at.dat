5|$|Merrifield opens The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic by {{discussing}} how archaeologists have understood magic and ritual practices in past societies, opining {{that on the}} whole {{it had been a}} neglected area of study. Looking at the archaeological evidence for ritual activity in the pre-Roman Iron Age and the Roman Iron Age of Britain, he discusses animal and human sacrifice, as well as the offering of votive deposits in rivers and other bodies of water. He moves on to explore the rituals surrounding death and burial, suggesting areas where this ritual activity is visible in the burial record of multiple societies. Merrifield goes on to discuss the archaeological evidence for ritual practices in Christian Europe, highlighting areas of ritual continuance from earlier pagan periods, in particular the deposition of metal goods in water. Looking at the evidence for foundation deposits in European buildings that likely had magico-religious purposes, he <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> several examples of written charms and spells which have survived in the archaeological record.|$|E
25|$|The Lempert-Nguyen indicator, devised in 2008 for practitioners, {{starts with}} the {{standards}} for sustainable development that have been agreed upon {{by the international community}} and <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> whether intergovernmental organizations such as the UNDP and other development actors are applying these principles in their projects and work as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Whitmore {{starts his}} {{argument}} {{by claiming that}} Hutton misrepresents the historical consensus {{of those who have}} studied the witch trials in the Early Modern period, highlighting the work of historians like Carlo Ginzburg, Gustav Henningsen, Gábor Klaniczay and Bengt Ankarloo, who argued that the witch trials were influenced by a substratum of pre-Christian shamanistic beliefs. Moving on, he criticises Hutton for failing to provide a solid definition of witchcraft, and then argues that, contrary to Hutton's claims, many Great Goddess cults existed in the ancient world. Proceeding to defend the ideas of ancient gods of death and resurrection put forward by James Frazer, Whitmore <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the British cunning folk, arguing that again Hutton made mistakes, in doing so highlighting the works of historians Emma Wilby and Éva Pócs.|$|E

25|$|When Gaston {{arrived to}} the Pawn Shop, he aims {{at what he}} thought was Gold but discovers a {{mannequin}} instead. He is then confronted by Belle, who now knows he was willing to kill Rumple and believed he still had feelings for her, only to learn that the book was punishment and a constant reminder of why he died. He was also shocked to discover Belle is now Gold's wife, and leaves furious. Belle tells Gold and made him promise not to hurt Gaston, but when she tells Gold about what Hades told her he just couldn't accept what Belle wanted. At the docks, Gold uses magic to choke Gaston by the throat, ready to send him to the River of Lost Souls, when Belle pulls the dagger and commands him not to hurt Gaston, and he drops Gaston on the ground. However, Gaston is unable to let his vendetta against Gold go, and when he goes for his arrow, Belle accidentally knockes Gaston out into the River of Lost Souls. Unfortunately, Belle discovers that because she saved Gold but interfered, Hades arrives to tell the couple that the contract allowing him to take their baby was still in effect, as Belle was the one who knocked Gaston into the Acheron, not Gold. He <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> a withering daisy flower that he picks up, as a sign of hope fading away. The burned flower later shows up at Granny's Diner, as a gift to Zelena from Hades.|$|E
500|$|For example, in Figure 1 above, the {{verification}} program {{sees the}} evaluation [...] "mate in three ply (Kc6)." [...] It <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> {{the position in}} Figure 2, after Kc6, and sees the evaluation [...] "mate in two ply." [...] These two evaluations are consistent with each other. [...] If the evaluation of Figure 2 were anything else, it would be inconsistent with Figure 1, so the tablebase {{would need to be}} corrected.|$|E
500|$|Peter dresses {{up like a}} stereotypical {{adolescent}} bully {{featured in}} 1980s films, and makes references to Pretty in Pink, No Retreat, No Surrender and The Karate Kid. He <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the ocean on a pier as Howard Jones' song, [...] "No One Is to Blame", plays. In one scene, Stewie refers to [...] "aging supermodel Carol Alt." [...] Before New Brian and Lois sing [...] "Summer Nights" [...] as featured in Grease, Peter sings R.E.M.'s [...] "Everybody Hurts". Stewie reads and then rips apart Nancy Reagan's memoir, My Turn.|$|E

500|$|Chapter seven, [...] "Cauldron of Animosities", {{opens with}} a {{discussion}} of U.S. support for the increasing militarization of Israel and its illegal development of nuclear weapons, something Chomsky believes threatens peace in the Middle East by encouraging nations like Iran and Iraq to do the same. He explores the longstanding western exploitation of the Middle East for its oil resources, first by the British Empire and subsequently by the U.S. post-World War II, and <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the U.S.' role in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, continually supporting Israel both militarily and politically, furthering human right abuses against the Palestinian people and repeatedly sabotaging the peace process.|$|E
500|$|... "The Mission" [...] <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> how Jesus {{may have}} been viewed by the {{religious}} leaders of the time. The canonical gospels report over one hundred cases of Jesus healing or performing exorcisms, and [...] "making the unclean clean again". Jesus told lepers {{to go up to}} the Temple Mount, where they were usually excluded, and claimed that he could forgive sins without going through the ordinary channels. Jesus met and ate with sinners, the disabled and prostitutes, and fulfilled Old Testament prophecy by riding into the Temple Mount through the Golden Gate on a donkey at Passover. Bowen concludes that all these reasons would have meant that the Pharisees of the time would have seen him as threatening.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Toshi was [...] "brainwashed" [...] by a cult called [...] "Home of Heart", {{leading to}} the group's breakup that year; guitarist hide died five months later in a {{reported}} suicide, though the band believe he died accidentally, {{trying to do a}} neck-stretching exercise while drunk. The film <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> Yoshiki following the band's split, where he returned to classical music and composed a piece in honour of the 10th anniversary of the reign of the Emperor Akihito, then the band's reunion in 2007, Taiji's suicide in 2011 eleven months after performing with the group {{for the first time in}} 18 years after being arrested in an air rage incident, and their continuing attempts to achieve worldwide success.|$|E

500|$|Michael, Pam, and Ryan (B. J. Novak) {{return to}} their office and believe they have been robbed. Dwight calls and reveals his treachery. Michael calls Dwight {{on the phone and}} tells Dwight he is going to steal his biggest client while he listens. Dwight races to the HarperCollins office, where Michael and Dwight start {{fighting}} over the client, Daniel Scofield (Bob Gebert). Mr. Scofield asks for both of their offers via email, and they agree to do so. Before leaving, Dwight <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> Daniel's personal information from Michael's Rolodex card and asks him about his [...] "gay son", which seemingly perturbs Daniel. [...] Michael reveals his unusual system where he color codes personal information about his contacts so he knows what not to talk about. Michael is seen laughing with Daniel in the parking lot as Dwight returns to his car alone.|$|E
500|$|Stace <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the {{positive}} divine; he asks how concepts {{can be applied}} to that which is above all concepts and finds that all propositions about God are symbolical. He defines religious and non-religious symbolism as differing in two respects. Firstly, religious symbols cannot be translated into logical propositions because they refer to an (ineffable) experience rather than a proposition. Secondly, the relationship between the religious symbol and what is symbolised is one of evocation rather than [...] "meaning", as meaning is a concept, which is absent in the mystical experience. [...] "Yet in some way this symbolic language evokes in us some glimpse, some hint, seen dimly through the mists and fogs which envelop us, of that being who stands above all human thought and conception." [...] He goes on to write that some of these symbols feel more appropriate than others (e.g. God is love not hate).|$|E
500|$|The book {{begins with}} a brief account of the {{physical}} causes of animal coloration. The second chapter gives {{an overview of the}} book, describing the various uses of colour in terms of the advantages it can bring through natural selection. The next seven chapters describe camouflage, both in predators and in prey. Methods of camouflage covered include background matching, resemblance to specific objects such as bird droppings, self-decoration with materials from the environment, and the seasonal colour change of arctic animals. Two chapters cover warning colours, including both Batesian mimicry, where the mimic is edible, and Mullerian mimicry, where distasteful species mimic each other. A chapter <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> how animals combine multiple methods of defence, for instance in the puss moth. Two chapters examine coloration related to sexual selection. Finally Poulton summarizes the subject with a fold-out table including a set of Greek derived words that he invented, of which [...] "aposematic" [...] and [...] "cryptic" [...] survive in biological usage.|$|E

500|$|Peter goes to {{retrieve}} Meg from her [...] "party" [...] and asks Meg {{to come as}} Lois wants her there. Meg just says it's just a birthday party and asks who would remember if she wasn't there. Peter says that Lois would as she remembers everything and that her best memories are of when Meg and her brothers were born. Peter then has an epiphany, the party is more for Lois than Stewie. Realizing how terrible she has been, Meg agrees {{to come home and}} the cult members agree as well. Peter makes a toast, <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> his watch before he can drink the poisoned punch and Pulls Meg out before she can drink Her's, oblivious {{to the fact that he}} is saving her life in the process while the cult members all die. The Cult Leader chases after them while wearing his ceremonial white robe and is mistaken by Stewie as [...] "The Man in White". Stewie does away with him and, feeling victorious, joins the others to enjoy his party.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} chapter, [...] "Offerings {{to earth and}} water in Pre-Roman and Roman Times", Merrifield explores {{the various forms of}} archaeological {{evidence}} for ritual deposits in the pre-Roman Iron Age and the Roman Iron Age of Britain. He provides an overview of the evidence for animal and human sacrifice, as well as that in support of ritual offerings in bodies of water such as the River Thames. Merrifield deals with votive deposits on land, in particular looking at the evidence for deposition in ditches, shafts and wells. He rounds off the chapter by examining evidence for Iron Age rituals that took place at the commencement and termination of building constructions. Chapter three, [...] "Rituals of Death", deals with the religious rituals accompanying death and burial, and their visibility in the archaeological record. It explains the three main ways which human communities have dealt with the corpses of the dead: through exposing them to elements and scavengers, through inhumation and through cremation. Looing at beliefs surrounding the afterlife, Merrifield discusses ways in which these beliefs might be visible in the archaeological record, such as through the deposition of grave goods. Discussing evidence for rituals of separation through which the deceased is separated from the world of the living, including those that deal with the decapitation of the body, Merrifield <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the effect of Christianity on burials in Europe, arguing that it brought a new intimacy with the dead through the collection of relics, which was in contrast to the pagan beliefs of the Roman Empire, which portrayed the deceased as unclean.|$|E
500|$|... "The Final Hours", {{the third}} episode of Son of God, details Jesus's last days alive. Bowen {{claims that the}} Last Supper would have been held {{in the guest room}} of a [...] "well-to-do" [...] house in Jerusalem. Writings by Josephus suggest that the Last Supper took place in a triclinium. As guest of honour, Jesus would have been {{at the end of the}} table with John the Apostle at his side, rather than at the centre, as {{proposed}} by more familiar depictions such as Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper. Bowen <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> whether or not Jesus could have sweated blood at Gethsemane. Leaving the Middle East for the first time, he travels to New York City and meets with Frederick Zugibe, a forensic pathologist at Columbia University. Zugibe states that Jesus may have been suffering from hematidrosis, a medical condition brought about by stress from knowing that one is about to die. He also says that he has seen similar symptoms in sailors and in men given death sentences. Zugibe experiments on volunteers in Rutland County, Vermont, by measuring their blood pressure while they are strapped to crosses with their arms outstretched and level with their shoulders. He concludes that the traditional view of Jesus's crucifixion, with the nails of the cross driven through his hands rather than wrists, may have been possible if his feet were supported. The 1968 discovery of the skeleton of Jehohanan, a first-century man who was put to death by crucifixion, also supports this theory. Next, Bowen questions whether the disciple Judas Iscariot truly did double-cross Jesus. William Klassen, an historian at École Biblique in Jerusalem, theorises that the Greek word [...] "paradidomi" [...] was mistranslated, and that Judas simply [...] "handed over" [...] Jesus to the Romans, rather than betrayed him.|$|E

2500|$|... 6. Aria of Ophélie. Ophélie is in {{the garden}} with a book in her hand. She laments Hamlet's distance, feeling his look is {{something}} like reproach (Ophélie: Sa main depuis hier n'a pas touché ma main! [...] "His hand has not touched mine since yesterday"). She reads from her book, at first silently, then aloud (Ophélie: [...] "Adieu, dit-il, ayez-foi!" [...] "'Adieu, he said, trust me!'"). Hamlet appears {{on the other side}} of the garden. (An English horn plays the Theme of Hamlet's Love.) Hamlet sees Ophélie and tarries. Again she reads aloud from her book (Ophélie: [...] "En vous, cruel, j'avais foi! Je vous aimais, aimez moi!" [...] "'In you, O cruel one, I believed. I loved you! Love me too!'"), <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> Hamlet. However, he remains silent, then rushes away. Ophélie says ruefully: Ah! ce livre a dit vrai! [...] "Ah! This book spoke the truth!" [...] and continues her aria (Ophélie: Les serments on des ailes! [...] "Promises have wings!").|$|E
2500|$|Within {{a week of}} the episode's {{original}} broadcast, {{the official}} Comedy Central website included five deleted scenes from [...] "Our Bounties Ourselves". In one 33-second clip, Dongalor spends time fondling, smelling and admiring the dress of the peasant girl, while singing a song by Yodeling Yorick. In another 30-second extended clip, Bruce discusses the homosexual context within the songs of Dongalor's favorite singer, Yodeling Yourick, especially in the songs [...] "You Make My Glory Whole" [...] and [...] "Blowing Snowflakes". In a third 30-second, the peasant girl laughs at a joke from Lord Roderick and tells Dongalor it's the first time she's laughed since he killed her father; Dongalor replies, [...] "Oh, so you're going to bring that up every time we're together." [...] In a fourth 24-second clip, Dongalor orders Barnabus to conceal the Eye of Gulga Grymna and offers the peasant girl some turtle soup, <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> her chest and says simply, [...] "Breasts". In the final 17-second clip, Aneka and Zezelryck recall their wet tunic contest fundraiser, but an angry Kröd insists the night never happened.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter one, [...] "The Study of Folklore and the Reclamation of Paganism", {{offers a}} {{historical}} introduction to Contemporary Paganism, looking {{at its roots}} in the Classical World of Greece and Rome, and then the successive influences of Neoplatonism, Renaissance magic, the Protestant Reformation and the Enlightenment. Magliocco <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the influence that 18th and 19th century folkloristics and anthropology had on the Romanticists and then Pagan movement, in particular the work of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the Brothers Grimm and Sir James Frazer. Proceeding to look at this relationship, she highlights the work of Charles Leland, Margaret Murray and Gerald Gardner, who drew from folklore in their own books, all of which heavily influenced modern Paganism. Magliocco argues that Contemporary Paganism {{can be viewed as a}} [...] "folk tradition" [...] on two levels; firstly, because it continues to work with and propagate the spiritual traditions of western esotericism, and secondly, because it acts as a form of [...] "resistance culture" [...] in opposition to dominant trends in western culture. Finally, she borrows the concept of [...] "textual poachers" [...] from the French sociologist Michel de Certeau, arguing that the Pagan community fit this model well, collating elements from a wide variety of sources and composing them into something new, in this case a religious movement.|$|E
