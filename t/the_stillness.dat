5|$|He {{notes the}} degree of {{artifice}} concealed behind the apparent simplicity of the imagery as everyday moments are captured. A piece of driftwood is tossed and broken by the waves; people stroll along the promenade; a group of dogs gather by the water's edge whilst ducks strut across the frame. A pool of water is shot at night {{with the sounds of}} a storm, and frogs croaking break <b>the</b> <b>stillness.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Bryan spoke {{his final}} sentence, recalling the Crucifixion of Jesus, {{he placed his}} hands to his temples, fingers {{extended}}; with the final words, he extended his arms to his sides straight out to his body and held that pose for about five seconds as if offering himself as sacrifice for the cause, as the audience watched in dead silence. He then lowered them, descended from the podium, and began to head back to his seat as <b>the</b> <b>stillness</b> held.|$|E

Some characters, referred to as orogenes, have the ability to manipulate geological energies on a large scale, as well as magic itself on a smaller scale. They are a persecuted and feared minority, though it is largely due to their efforts humanity has survived the Seasons at all.|$|E
25|$|The 3d Bombardment Wing, one of {{the first}} air units to {{intervene}} {{on the side of the}} United Nations in 1950 was also the last air unit to drop ordnance on the North on 27 July 1953.

500|$|According to Miles, {{despite a}} celebratory opening, [...] "Mary's {{physical}} stillness {{as proof of}} her virginity remains the poet's priority." [...] As a result, the poet repeats the phrase [...] "He cam also stylle" [...] {{in three of the}} five verses.

500|$|Kristine Sutherland (Joyce) was {{informed}} {{during the third}} season that her character would be killed off, which she accepted because she intended {{to spend time in}} Europe. She is absent from most of the fourth season because she was traveling.

500|$|Shortly {{before the}} book went to print, Benchley and Congdon needed {{to choose a}} title. Benchley had many working titles during development, many of which he calls [...] "pretentious", such as <b>The</b> <b>Stillness</b> in the Water and Leviathan Rising. Benchley {{regarded}} other ideas, such as The Jaws of Death and The Jaws of Leviathan, as [...] "melodramatic, weird or pretentious". Congdon and Benchley brainstormed about the title frequently, with the writer estimating about 125 ideas raised. The novel still {{did not have a}} title until twenty minutes before production of the book. The writer discussed the problem with editor Tom Congdon at a restaurant in New York: ...|$|E
60|$|In <b>the</b> general <b>stillness,</b> <b>the</b> {{opening of}} {{the door at the}} top of the steps came sharply to his ears. He looked up. Two figures were silhouetted for a moment against the light, and then the door closed again. They began to move slowly down the steps.|$|R
60|$|As I lay there, there arose out of <b>the</b> utter <b>stillness</b> <b>the</b> {{rumbling}} of {{a carriage}} {{a very great}} way off, that drew near, and passed within a few streets of the house, and died away as gradually as it had arisen. This, too, was as a reminiscence.|$|R

500|$|During the 1780s {{the concept}} of the picturesque ruin was popularised by the English clergyman William Gilpin. Goodrich Castle was one of the ruins he {{captured}} in his book Observations on the River Wye in 1782, writing that the castle was an example of the [...] "correctly picturesque" [...] landscape. By this time, the castle was in a slow state of decay. Theodore Fielding, an early Victorian historian, noted how the [...] "castle's situation, far from human dwellings, and <b>the</b> <b>stillness</b> which that solitude, insures to its precinct, leaves contemplation to all the solemnity, that is inspired by the sight of grandeur sinking in dignity, into decay". The Regency and Victorian watercolour artists David Cox and William Callow also captured Goodrich Castle and its landscape in paint, again invoking the picturesque, romantic mood of the setting at the time.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, {{art critic}} Tom Lubbock {{considered}} the painting [...] "one {{of the most}} striking" [...] chronophotography-inspired works, pointing to several features which create a comical effect: the [...] "abrupt close-up" [...] on a trivial subject—a [...] "twee prim sausage dog"—which {{might have been a}} single detail in an Impressionist street scene; the [...] juxtaposition of the word dynamism, [...] "with its connotations of heroism, of the mighty modern machine world" [...] against that subject; the cropping of the owner at the knee, giving a dog's view (and anticipating Tom and Jerry cartoons); and the apparently frenetic motion of the dog's limbs and tail coupled with <b>the</b> <b>stillness</b> of its body, suggesting little forward progress. Lubbock describes Balla's motion effects as [...] "creating new sensations and new phenomena", and evoking the motion of shuffling cards and the embodiment of ghosts.|$|E
500|$|Bryan {{described}} <b>the</b> <b>stillness</b> as [...] "really painful"; his anxieties that {{he might}} have failed were soon broken by pandemonium. [...] The New York World reported, [...] "The floor of the convention seemed to heave up. [...] Everybody seemed to go mad at once." [...] In a demonstration of some half an hour, Bryan was carried around the floor, then surrounded with cheering supporters. [...] Men and women threw their hats into the air, not caring where they might come down. [...] Delegates were shouting to begin the vote and nominate Bryan immediately, which he refused to consider, feeling that if his appeal could not last overnight, it would not last until November. [...] Bryan left the convention, returning to his hotel to await the outcome. [...] In the midst of the crazed crowd, Altgeld, a Bland supporter, commented to his friend, lawyer Clarence Darrow, [...] "That is the greatest speech I ever listened to. [...] I don't know but its effect will be to nominate him." ...|$|E

500|$|According to writer Joseph Maddrey, [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] shares themes {{with his}} more famous {{conversion}} poem [...] "Ash Wednesday", the first parts of which Eliot was writing when [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] was written and published. Eliot uses the biblical story of Simeon {{to illustrate the}} [...] "contrast between appearance and reality and humbly begs God to teach him <b>the</b> <b>stillness</b> that unifies the two". Eliot's Ariel poems and [...] "Ash Wednesday" [...] explore this new experience of conversion and {{the progress of the}} soul. Scofield writes that Eliot's depiction of Simeon presents [...] "a figure to whom revelation has been granted but to whom it has come too late for this life". [...] But as he awaits the death for which he asks, Simeon sees the consequences of the turning of faith to this new child and his mission. Simeon wants nothing of this [...] "time of sorrow" [...] and that the fate of persecution for the consequences of faith is not for him.|$|E

2500|$|John Gielgud {{calculated}} that his grandmother played about 100 roles in her short career. Her last stage appearance before her retirement was in October 1867 at the Prince's Theatre, Manchester, in Tom Taylor's Plot and Passion. The Manchester Guardian ended its {{report on the}} performance: [...] "In our unwilling acceptance of her farewell, we must now rest satisfied with {{the memory of the}} peerless beauty of her merry-hearted acting... like the music of a bewitching melody piercing <b>the</b> <b>stillness</b> of the night, and ending just when the ear longed for the next note." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ranney enjoyed duck hunting, {{which is}} {{reflected}} {{in some of his}} paintings on that theme, which are noted for their solidly constructed, almost sculpture-like figures. His most popular and requested work is his 1850 painting On the Wing, which portrays a sportsman with dead game at his feet, about to shoot down his next target. Ranney produced at least four different versions of this print, the most recognized of which was reserved for the Butler Institute of American Art. It was published in the gift book Ornaments of Memory in 1856 and 1857. This version is set in a more windblown environment, noted for the contrast generated with <b>the</b> <b>stillness</b> of the human figures within it. The portrayal of the outdoorsman in On the Wing contributed to the era's nationalistic imagery. Mark Thistelthwaite of the Butler Institute, describes this piece as: ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} in this cottage that the first dawnings of the Jungle Books came to Kipling: [...] " [...] [...] {{workroom}} in the Bliss Cottage was seven feet by eight, and from December to April, the snow lay level with its window-sill. It chanced that I had written a tale about Indian Forestry work which included a boy who had been brought up by wolves. In <b>the</b> <b>stillness,</b> and suspense, of the winter of ’92 some memory of the Masonic Lions of my childhood's magazine, and a phrase in Haggard's Nada the Lily, combined with the echo of this tale. After blocking out the main idea in my head, the pen took charge, and I watched it begin to write stories about Mowgli and animals, which later grew into the two Jungle Books [...] ". With Josephine's arrival, Bliss Cottage was felt to be congested, so eventually the couple bought land — [...] on a rocky hillside overlooking the Connecticut River — from Carrie's brother Beatty Balestier and built their own house.|$|E
