It {{is time for}} Republicans in the White House and Congress who distrust Democrats to acknowledge that greater Democratic involvement and support in <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> critical to rebuilding the support of the American people that is essential to our success in that war. It is time for Americans and we their leaders to start working together again on the war on terrorism. To encourage that new American partnership, I propose that the President and the leadership of Congress establish a bipartisan Victory in Iraq Working Group, composed of members of both parties in Congress and high ranking national security officials of the Bush Administration." ...|$|E

5000|$|President of the United States George W.

[...] While other proponents of the war have regularly echoed this assertion, as the conflict has dragged on, members of the U.S. Congress, the American public, and even U.S. troops have begun to question the connection between Iraq and the fight against terrorism.

50|$|Though {{critics have}} charged that Jewish {{interests}} were partially {{responsible for the}} push to war with Iraq, Jewish Americans are actually more strongly opposed to the Iraq war than any other major religious group or even most Americans. The greater {{opposition to the war}} is not simply a result of high Democratic identification among U.S. Jews, as Jews of all political persuasions are more likely to oppose the war than non-Jews who share the same political leanings. The widespread Jewish opposition to <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> also {{not simply a matter of}} the majority of Americans now also opposing the war because the majority of Jews already opposed the war in 2003 and 2004 when most Americans did not.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the last}} two {{paragraphs}} of his op-ed, Wilson relates his perspective to the Bush administration's rationale for the Iraq War:I was convinced before the war {{that the threat of}} weapons of mass destruction in the hands of Saddam Hussein required a vigorous and sustained international response to disarm him. Iraq possessed and had used chemical weapons; it had an active biological weapons program and quite possibly a nuclear research programâ€”all of which were in violation of United Nations resolutions. Having encountered Mr. Hussein and his thugs in the run-up to the Persian Gulf war of 1991, I was only too aware of the dangers he posed.But were these dangers the same ones the administration told us about? We have to find out. America's foreign policy depends on the sanctity of its information. For this reason, questioning the selective use of intelligence to justify <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> neither idle sniping nor [...] "revisionist history", as Mr. Bush has suggested. The act of war is the last option of a democracy, taken when there is a grave threat to our national security. More than 200 American soldiers have lost their lives in Iraq already. We have a duty to ensure that their sacrifice came for the right reasons.|$|E
5000|$|Lieberman {{defended his}} support of the Iraq Resolution; in a November 29, 2005 op-ed piece for The Wall Street Journal, he praised {{the efforts of the}} U.S. {{military}} in the occupation of Iraq and criticized both parties:"I am disappointed by Democrats who are more focused on how President Bush took America into the war in Iraq almost three years ago, and by Republicans who are more worried about whether the war will bring them down in next November's elections, than they are concerned about how we continue the progress in Iraq in the months and years ahead."Later, on December 7, 2005, Lieberman said, [...] "It is time for Democrats who distrust President Bush to acknowledge that he will be Commander-in-Chief for three more critical years, and that in matters of war we undermine Presidential credibility at our nationâ€™s peril.
