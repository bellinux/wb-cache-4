40|$|ObjectiveThe {{impact of}} size {{matching}} between {{donor and recipient}} is unclear in lung transplantation. Therefore, we determined the relation of donor lung size to 1) posttransplant survival and 2) pulmonary function as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second. MethodsFrom 1990 to 2006, 469 adults underwent lung transplantation with lungs from donors aged 7 to 70 years. Donor and recipient <b>total</b> lung <b>capacities</b> were calculated using established formulae (predicted <b>total</b> lung <b>capacity),</b> and actual recipient lung size was measured in the pulmonary function laboratory. Disparity between donor and recipient lung size was expressed as a ratio of donor predicted <b>total</b> lung <b>capacity</b> to recipient predicted total lung capacity—the predicted <b>total</b> lung <b>capacity</b> ratio—and predicted donor <b>total</b> lung <b>capacity</b> to actual recipient total lung capacity—the actual <b>total</b> lung <b>capacity</b> ratio. Survival was measured by multiphase hazard methodology and repeated measures of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey–normalized forced expiratory volume in 1 second analyzed by temporal decomposition. ResultsPredicted <b>total</b> lung <b>capacity</b> ratio and actual <b>total</b> lung <b>capacity</b> ratio ranged widely, from 0. 55 to 1. 59 and 0. 52 to 4. 20, respectively. Overall survival was unaffected by predicted <b>total</b> lung <b>capacity</b> ratio (P =. 3) or actual <b>total</b> lung <b>capacity</b> ratio (P =. 5). Patients with emphysema and an actual <b>total</b> lung <b>capacity</b> ratio of 0. 67 or less or 1. 03 or greater had higher predicted mortality (P =. 01). During the first posttransplant year, forced expiratory volume in 1 second increased and then gradually declined. Predicted <b>total</b> lung <b>capacity</b> ratio and actual <b>total</b> lung <b>capacity</b> ratio had a small impact on forced expiratory volume in 1 second, primarily in the late phase after transplant in a disease-specific manner. ConclusionSize matching between donor and recipient using predicted <b>total</b> lung <b>capacity</b> ratio and actual <b>total</b> lung <b>capacity</b> ratio is an effective technique. Wide discrepancies in lung sizing do not affect overall posttransplant survival or pulmonary function. Therefore, {{a greater degree of}} lung size mismatch can likely be accepted, thereby improving patients' odds of undergoing transplantation...|$|R
