5|$|Toy Storys {{script was}} {{strongly}} influenced by the ideas of screenwriter Robert McKee. The members of Pixar's story team—Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Joe Ranft—were aware {{that most of them}} were beginners at writing for feature films. None of them had any feature story or writing credits to their name besides Ranft, who had taught a story class at CalArts and did some storyboard work prior. Seeking insight, Lasseter and Docter attended a three-day seminar in Los Angeles given by McKee. His principles, grounded in Aristotle's Poetics, dictated that a character emerges most realistically and compellingly from the choices that the protagonist makes in reaction to his problems. Disney also appointed Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow and, later, Joss Whedon to help develop the script. Whedon found that the script wasn't working but had a great structure, and added the character of Rex and sought a pivotal role for Barbie. The story team continued <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> the script as production was underway. Among the late additions was the encounter between Buzz and the alien squeaky toys at Pizza Planet, which emerged from a brainstorming session with a dozen directors, story artists, and animators from Disney.|$|E
25|$|The {{first and}} most {{extensive}} recorded cleaning, revarnishing, and touch-up of the Mona Lisa was an 1809 wash and revarnishing undertaken by Jean-Marie Hooghstoel, {{who was responsible for}} restoration of paintings for the galleries of the Musée Napoléon. The work involved cleaning with spirits, touch-up of colour, and revarnishing the painting. In 1906, Louvre restorer Eugène Denizard performed watercolour retouches on areas of the paint layer disturbed by the crack in the panel. Denizard also retouched the edges of the picture with varnish, to mask areas that had been covered initially by an older frame. In 1913, when the painting was recovered after its theft, Denizard was again called upon to work on the Mona Lisa. Denizard was directed to clean the picture without solvent, and to lightly touch up several scratches to the painting with watercolour. In 1952, the varnish layer over the background in the painting was evened out. After the second 1956 attack, restorer Jean-Gabriel Goulinat was directed <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> the damage to Mona Lisas left elbow with watercolour.|$|E
500|$|The producer, John F. S. Laing, blamed Pyun for {{the failure}} of the film. After the filming was {{completed}} on Guam, director Isaac Florentine was hired <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> the film in Los Angeles in order to improve its marketability, adding around ten minutes of screen time in the process. Florentine declined screen credit, stating in a later interview that he [...] "n't feel it [...] fair" [...] to Pyun. The L.A. shoot took ten days, and featured David Carradine and Richard Roundtree, who were not part of the original cut.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ben Richards. The general plot of India and Pakistan {{on the verge of}} nuclear war is based on actual reports of {{conflict}} between the two nations. The beginning was not originally in the script; Richards wanted to feature a submarine crisis, but the producers were not sure what the crisis would be. They eventually decided to have an Indian submarine [...] "taken hostage" [...] by the Pakistanis. They wanted to add a personal stake towards Tariq, by revealing that members of his family live in Pakistan. The intent was to include and develop a potential relationship between Ros and Lawrence {{to the point where they}} bond during their final scenes before the hotel explosion. They also wanted <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> on the Harry/Ruth relationship, which was not in the original script; so Ben Richards added the scenes as additional dialogue.|$|E
2500|$|Like Zimmerman, George {{also took}} the {{opportunity}} for the Enterprise-D's screen debut <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> its exterior. Because Generations featured the Enterprise-D separating into its saucer and engineering sections, the original [...] model built by ILM for the television series was hauled out of storage. The ship was stripped, rewired, and its surface detailed {{to stand up to}} scrutiny of the silver screen. George changed the paint job, as he recalled they had been in a rush to prep the model for television and its green-and-blue color scheme did not properly read on film. The paint scheme was shifted towards a [...] "battleship grey", with glossy tiled areas reminiscent of the original feature film Enterprise.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{draft for}} the remake had moved the setting to {{northern}} California, and altered the third act to include {{elements of the}} supernatural. When that script was rejected, Carl Ellsworth was brought in <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> the script written by Adam Alleca. Ellsworth had previously worked with Craven on Red Eye, but {{had never seen the}} original Last House on the Left. After reading the script and watching the 1972 film—the latter he found difficult to watch because of its extreme nature—Ellsworth decided that the first thing they needed to do was to establish someone whose survival you wanted the audience to root for. The writer wanted to know how the [...] "typical family" [...] would react to such a heinous act being perpetrated on their daughter, and what they were truly capable of. Craven points out that most of the early script problems were based around deciding what elements to include. They were never sure how much of the Krug family needed to be seen, what elements from the original film should be included, or even if Mari should live or die.|$|E

60|$|They {{had already}} talked over {{what would be}} their best course in such a contingency, and {{proceeded}} at once to put their plans into execution. They had, at starting, taken with them a supply of the paints used in their decoration; and with these they proceeded <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> the coloring on their faces and white shirts, and on the strange ornaments which had been affixed to their heads. Two of them now took their place, one at the stern and the other at {{the bow of the}} canoe. The other two stood up, and paddled very quietly and slowly along; and as the canoe approached rapidly, the four broke into a song--one of the old Devonshire catches, which they had often sung together on board ship.|$|E
6000|$|Only, as it happened, I {{knew the}} poet personally; I {{had seen him}} a great many times, and he had an {{appearance}} that nobody could possibly forget, if seen only once. He had the mark of those dark and passionate Westland Scotch, who before Burns and after have given many such dark eyes and dark emotions to the world. But in him the unmistakable strain, Gaelic or whatever it is, was accentuated almost to oddity; and he looked like some swarthy elf. He was small, with a big head and a crescent of coal-black hair round {{the back of a}} vast dome of baldness. Immediately under his eyes his cheekbones had so high a colour that they might have been painted scarlet; three black tufts, two on the upper lip and one under the lower, seemed <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> the face with the fierce moustaches of Mephistopheles. His eyes had that [...] "dancing madness" [...] in them which Stevenson saw in the Gaelic eyes of Alan Breck; but he sometimes distorted the expression by screwing a monstrous monocle into one of them. A man more unmistakable would have been hard to find. You could have picked him out in any crowd&mdash;so long as you had not seen his photograph.|$|E

60|$|The {{comedy of}} The Good-Natured Man was doomed to {{experience}} delays and difficulties {{to the very}} last. Garrick, notwithstanding his professions, had still a lurking grudge against the author, and tasked his managerial arts to thwart him in his theatrical enterprise. For this purpose he undertook to build up Hugh Kelly, Goldsmith's boon companion of the Wednesday Club, {{as a kind of}} rival. Kelly had written a comedy called False Delicacy, in which were embodied all the meretricious qualities of the sentimental school. Garrick, though he had decried that school, and had brought out his comedy of The Clandestine Marriage in opposition to it, now lauded False Delicacy to the skies, and prepared to bring it out at Drury Lane with all possible stage effect. He {{even went so far as}} to write a prologue and epilogue for it, and <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> some parts of the dialogue. He had become reconciled to his former colleague, Colman, and it is intimated that one condition in the treaty of peace between these potentates of the realms of pasteboard (equally prone to play into each other's hands with the confederate potentates on the great theater of life) was that Goldsmith's play should be kept back until Kelly's had been brought forward.|$|E
60|$|The young Duke had not {{experienced}} many weeks {{of his career}} before he began to sicken of living in an hotel. Hitherto he had not reaped any of {{the fruits of the}} termination of his minority. He was a cavalier seul, highly considered, truly, but yet a mere member of society. He had been this for years. This was not the existence to enjoy which he had hurried to England. He aspired to be society itself. In a word, his tastes were of the most magnificent description, and he sighed to be surrounded by a court. As Hauteville House, even with Sir Carte's extraordinary exertions, could not be ready for his reception for three years, which to him appeared eternity, he determined to look about for an establishment. He was fortunate. A nobleman who possessed an hereditary mansion of the first class, and much too magnificent for his resources, suddenly became diplomatic, and accepted an embassy. The Duke of St. James took everything off his hands: house, furniture, wines, cooks, servants, horses. Sir Carte was sent in <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> the gilding and make a few temporary improvements; and Lady Fitz-pompey pledged herself to organise the whole establishment ere the full season commenced and the early Easter had elapsed, which had now arrived.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{with the}} most gracious {{deference}} in the world, {{so as not to}} hurt the hairdresser's feelings, she showed my head, and begged permission <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> her niece's, kissing her as she did so. Then she signed to the Prince to hold her little hand-mirror, and he obeyed, kneeling on one knee before Mademoiselle; while the Queen, with hands that really were more dexterous than those of any one I ever saw, excepting my mother, dealt with her niece's hair, paying compliments in her son's name all the time, and keeping him in check with her eye. She contrived to work in some of her own jewels, rubies and diamonds, to match the scarlet, black and white. I have since found the scene mentioned in Mademoiselle's own memoirs, but she did not see a quarter of the humour of it. She was serene in the certainty that her aunt was paying court to her, and the assurance that her cousin was doing the same, though she explains that, having hopes of the Emperor, and thinking the Prince a mere landless exile, she only pitied him. Little did she guess how he laughed at her, his mother, and himself, most of all at her airs, while his mother, scolding him all the time, joined in the laugh, though she always maintained that Mademoiselle, in spite of her overweening conceit and vanity, would become an excellent and faithful wife, and make her husband's interests her own.|$|E

Then, again, it is lucky that the ball hit me below the elbow and not above it. O'Flaherty says {{they will be able to}} make a dacent job of it, and that after a bit they will be able to fit a wooden arm on, so that I can screw a fork into it. The worst of it at present is, that I have a terrible thirst on me, and nothing but water have they given me, a thing that I have not drunk for years. They have tied up the arteries, and they are going {{presently}} <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> the loose ends with hot pitch to stop the bleeding altogether. It is not a pleasant job; they have done it to three or four of the men already. One of them stood it well, but the others cried a thousand murders. O'Flaherty has promised me a drink of whisky and water before they do it, and just at present I feel as if I would let them burn all my limbs at the same price. It is sorry I am, Terence, to hear that your father is hit so hard, but O'Flaherty says he will get through it all right. Well, he will get his majority, though I am mightily sorry that Harrison is killed; he was a good boy, though he was an Englishman. Ah, Terence, my heart's sore when I think what I said that evening after the fight at Rolica! I did not mean it altogether, but the words come home to me now. It is not for meself but for the poor boys that have gone. It was just thoughtlessness, but I would give me other arm not to have said those words." ...|$|E
60|$|This amiable monarch now {{thought of}} taking another wife. He {{proposed}} to the French King {{to have some}} of the ladies of the French Court exhibited before him, that he might make his Royal choice; but the French King answered that he would rather not have his ladies trotted out to be shown like horses at a fair. He proposed to the Dowager Duchess of Milan, who replied that she might have thought of such a match if she had had two heads; but, that only owning one, she must beg to keep it safe. At last Cromwell represented that there was a Protestant Princess in Germany--those who held the reformed religion were called Protestants, because their leaders had Protested against the abuses and impositions of the unreformed Church--named ANNE OF CLEVES, who was beautiful, and would answer the purpose admirably. The King said was she a large woman, because he must have a fat wife? 'O yes,' said Cromwell; 'she was very large, just the thing.' On hearing this the King sent over his famous painter, Hans Holbein, to take her portrait. Hans made her out to be so good-looking that the King was satisfied, and the marriage was arranged. But, whether anybody had paid Hans <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> the picture; or whether Hans, like one or two other painters, flattered a princess in the ordinary way of business, I cannot say: all I know is, that when Anne came over and the King went to Rochester to meet her, and first saw her without her seeing him, he swore she was 'a great Flanders mare,' and said he would never marry her. Being obliged to do it now matters had gone so far, he would not give her the presents he had prepared, and would never notice her. He never forgave Cromwell his part in the affair. His downfall dates from that time.|$|E
