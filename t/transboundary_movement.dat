40|$|Biotechnology or the {{engineering}} {{of the genetic}} material of species can give way to avenues of possibilities {{for the benefit of}} people, fauna and flora but also has the potential of untold and undiscovered threats to humanity and living organisms. One of the first attempts to legislate on international rules on biotechnology {{can be traced back to}} Article 19 of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 1992. The CBD is indeed the first international legal instrument apart from the then European Community’s relevant directives to suggest that biotechnology is a matter of concern for the international community while providing a basis upon which more detailed procedures would be elaborated in the field of biosafety. Whilst the CBD includes international rules on access to genetic resources, access to and transfer of technology, handling of biotechnology and distribution of its benefits, it does not include a detailed regulation on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and their possible adverse effects on the environment, human and animal health. It was only with the coming into existence of the Cartagena Protocol On Biosafety (Cartagena Protocol) to the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2000, that the safe transfer, handling and use of living modified organisms (LMOs) such as genetically engineered plants, animals, and microbes, were at last being catered for, albeit leaving aside the broader categories of GMOs. Ten years later, rules and procedures on damages resulting from <b>transboundary</b> <b>movements</b> of LMOs was adopted with the Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. Twenty years after the “Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit” and nine years after the entry into force of the Cartagena Protocol, <b>transboundary</b> <b>movements</b> of GMOs have certainly increased with new categories of GMOs and genetically modified (GM) products. Is the international legal framework for <b>transboundary</b> <b>movements</b> of GMOs adequate for the protection of the environment while taking into account human and animal health? The interaction between direct international legal instruments regulating <b>transboundary</b> <b>movements</b> of LMOs and international trade laws, different interests at stake, the variety of domestic or regional biosafety schemes, authorization, labelling and traceability obligations doubtlessly bring many challenges to the existing international framework. A better governance of <b>transboundary</b> <b>movements</b> of GMOs at the international level would certainly need a consensus on the regulation of <b>transboundary</b> <b>movements</b> of additional categories of GMOs as well as the harmonization of identification and traceability standards, a harmonized risk assessment and management system and a liability and redress regime for damages resulting from <b>transboundary</b> <b>movements</b> of GMOs. Its implementation is limited to the extent that there is a lack of consensus on approaches to be adopted and dispute resolution procedures. When the Cartagena Protocol came into existence to provide for an international legal biosafety framework, key issues mainly pertained to the scope of the GMOs covered by this protocol and by the Advanced Informed Agreement (AIA) procedure, identification and traceability issues, the relationship of this protocol with other prior international agreements and liability and redress issues. The main purpose of this paper is to analyse key biosafety issues in 2012 by highlighting challenges and opportunities to improve the international governance of <b>transboundary</b> <b>movements</b> of GMOs...|$|R

The growth in North-South waste trade led to concern over the dumping of hazardous wastes in developing countries (the ‘South’) resulting in the UNEP mandating the Global Convention on <b>Transboundary</b> <b>Movements</b> in Hazardous Wastes. The Basel Convention provided for a system to monitor and control the <b>transboundary</b> <b>movements</b> of hazardous wastes.

50|$|The Protocol {{promotes}} biosafety {{by establishing}} {{rules and procedures}} for the safe transfer, handling, and use of LMOs, with specific focus on transboundary movements of LMOs. It features a set of procedures including one for LMOs {{that are to be}} intentionally introduced into the environment called the advance informed agreement procedure, and one for LMOs that are intended to be used directly as food or feed or for processing. Parties to the Protocol must ensure that LMOs are handled, packaged and transported under conditions of safety. Furthermore, the shipment of LMOs subject to <b>transboundary</b> <b>movement</b> must be accompanied by appropriate documentation specifying, among other things, identity of LMOs and contact point for further information. These procedures and requirements are designed to provide importing Parties with the necessary information needed for making informed decisions about whether or not to accept LMO imports and for handling them in a safe manner.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Advance Informed Agreement" [...] (AIA) {{procedure}} {{applies to}} the first intentional <b>transboundary</b> <b>movement</b> of LMOs for intentional introduction into {{the environment of the}} Party of import. It includes four components: notification by the Party of export or the exporter, acknowledgment of receipt of notification by the Party of import, the decision procedure, and opportunity for review of decisions. The purpose of this procedure is to ensure that importing countries have both the opportunity and the capacity to assess risks that may be associated with the LMO before agreeing to its import. The Party of import must indicate the reasons on which its decisions are based (unless consent is unconditional). A Party of import may, at any time, in light of new scientific information, review and change a decision. A Party of export or a notifier may also request the Party of import to review its decisions.|$|E
