5|$|In 2005, after {{a hundred}} years of neglect, {{a part of the}} Mare aux Songes swamp was {{excavated}} by an international team of researchers (International Dodo Research Project). To prevent malaria, the British had covered <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> with hard core during their rule over Mauritius, which had to be removed. Many remains were found, including bones of at least 17 dodos in various stages of maturity (though no juveniles), and several bones obviously from the skeleton of one individual bird, which have been preserved in their natural position. These findings were made public in December 2005 in the Naturalis museum in Leiden. 63% of the fossils found in <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> belonged to turtles of the extinct Cylindraspis genus, and 7.1% belonged to dodos, which had been deposited within several centuries, 4,000 years ago. Subsequent excavations suggested that dodos and other animals became mired in the Mare aux Songes while trying to reach water during a long period of severe drought about 4,200 years ago. Furthermore, cyanobacteria thrived in the conditions created by the excrements of animals gathered around <b>the</b> <b>swamp,</b> which died of intoxication, dehydration, trampling, and miring. Though many small skeletal elements were found during the recent excavations of <b>the</b> <b>swamp,</b> few were found during the 19th century, probably owing to the employment of less refined methods when collecting.|$|E

5|$|Until 1860, {{the only}} known dodo remains were the four {{incomplete}} 17th-century specimens. Philip Burnard Ayres found the first subfossil bones in 1860, which were sent to Richard Owen at the British Museum, who did not publish the findings. In 1863, Owen requested the Mauritian Bishop Vincent Ryan to spread word {{that he should be}} informed if any dodo bones were found. In 1865, George Clark, the government schoolmaster at Mahébourg, finally found an abundance of subfossil dodo bones in <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> of Mare aux Songes in Southern Mauritius, after a 30-year search inspired by Strickland and Melville's monograph. In 1866, Clark explained his procedure to The Ibis, an ornithology journal: he had sent his coolies to wade through the centre of <b>the</b> <b>swamp,</b> feeling for bones with their feet. At first they found few bones, until they cut away herbage that covered the deepest part of <b>the</b> <b>swamp,</b> where they found many fossils. <b>The</b> <b>swamp</b> yielded the remains of over 300 dodos, but very few skull and wing bones, possibly because the upper bodies were washed away or scavenged while the lower body was trapped. The situation is similar to many finds of moa remains in New Zealand marshes. Most dodo remains from the Mare aux Songes have a medium to dark brown colouration.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, maroons came to live in the Great Dismal Swamp.

Some slaves lived there in semi-free conditions, but how much independence slaves actually enjoyed there has been a topic of much debate. Nearby whites often left enslaved maroons alone so long as they paid a quota in logs or shingles, and businesses may have ignored the fugitive nature of escaped slaves who provided work in exchange for trade goods.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{possible}} single-egg clutch and the bird's large size, it has been proposed that the dodo was K-selected, meaning that it produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required parental care until they matured. Some evidence, including the large size {{and the fact that}} tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates, indicates that the bird may have had a protracted development period. The fact that no juvenile dodos have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp may indicate that they produced little offspring, that they matured rapidly, that the breeding grounds were far away from <b>the</b> <b>swamp,</b> or that the risk of miring was seasonal.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>swamps</b> play an {{important}} hydrological role within the mountains landscapes, controlling and regulating the movement of water. The sponge-like nature of <b>the</b> <b>swamps</b> which sustains flows into surrounding streams, has multiple effects on the water quality reaching these streams.

50|$|Yaffe's first {{efforts to}} {{eradicate}} malaria focused on drying <b>the</b> <b>swamps.</b> He used many methods, including wide use of eucalyptus trees, {{on the principle}} that the large tree would draw a lot of water from the ground. Also, manual efforts were undertaken to dry <b>the</b> <b>swamps.</b> <b>The</b> residents of Hadera and foreign workers from Africa (who arrived after Yaffe requested help from Baron Rothschild) began the physically demanding labor of drying <b>the</b> <b>swamps</b> using a wide network of canals, connecting <b>the</b> <b>swamps</b> to <b>the</b> Hadera Stream. Another approach taken by Yaffe was research. Yaffe left for Europe and learned novel theories about malaria. Among these studies was one that suggested that mosquitoes from the genus Anopheles, which were prevalent in swamps, were carriers of the disease. He began to plead with farmers to hang canopies around the beds, nets around the windows, and to clean every pool of standing water. Likewise, Yaffe convinced Baron Rothschild to send men to kill the mosquitoes. Afterward the incidence of malaria decreased, and efforts to dry <b>the</b> <b>swamps</b> continued with greater force. Forestation of large areas near Hadera with eucalyptus trees was part of Yaffe's effort to change the environment in order to respond comprehensively to the disease.|$|R
