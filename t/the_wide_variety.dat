Ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae have been observed in arctic and alpine tundra, boreal and alpine forest, north temperate forest, mires, mediterranean forests and scrub (maquis), miombo woodland, tropical lowland rainforest, tropical cloud forest, tropical dry forest, Australian eucalypt woodlands, and south temperate forests. Where they are introduced, they typically grow in plantations of their native host species, e.g. with pine in South Africa, Eucalyptus in Thailand, or birch in New Zealand.|$|E

Invasive species that crowd out slower-spreading natives include annual lovegrass and brome (cheat grass).|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} and docility of the dromedary make it popular as a domesticated animal. According to Richard Bulliet, {{they can be}} used {{for a wide variety of}} purposes: riding, transport, ploughing, trading and as a source of milk, meat, wool and leather. The main attraction of the dromedary for nomadic desert-dwellers is <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> <b>variety</b> of resources they provide, which are crucial for their survival. It is important for several Bedouin pastoralist tribes of northern Arabia, such as the Ruwallah, the Bani Sakhr and the Mutayr.|$|E

In 1972 this was {{increased}} {{to a total of}} 65 speaking stops. The Positive division, with its separate case behind the console, was installed at the same time. Problems caused by the tonal scheme's lack of coherence– the 1895 pipework contrasting sharply with that of 1972– and with reliability, caused by <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> <b>variety</b> of different types of key actions, all difficult to access, led to the decision to have the instrument rebuilt yet again.|$|E

In the north of the county the Limestone of the Mendip Hills dominates the landscape, while in the south the Blackdown and Quantock Hills rise out of the levels.

5|$|The {{mountain}} {{is part of}} a popular hiking area, with the Appalachian Trail crossing the summit and one of the Appalachian Mountain Club's eight mountain huts, the Lakes of the Clouds Hut, located on one of the mountain's shoulders. Winter recreation includes Tuckerman Ravine, famous for its Memorial Day skiing and its 45-degree slopes. The ravine is notorious for its avalanches, of which about 100 are recorded every year, and which have killed six people since 1849. Scores of hikers have died on the mountain in all seasons, due to harsh and rapidly changing conditions, inadequate equipment, and failure to plan for <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> <b>variety</b> of conditions which can occur above tree line.|$|E

A study in 1998 {{discovered}} the following species on the island: African darter (Anhinga rufa), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>wide</b> <b>variety</b> {{of musical}} performances, {{whether or not}} they are artificially amplified (6, 7, 9, 10), all provide {{entertainment}} irrespective of whether the performance is from soloists (6), choral (2) or orchestral groups (5, 8), or ensemble (3). Live performances use specialised venues, which might be small or large; indoors or outdoors; free or expensive. The audiences have different expectations of the performers as well as of their own role in the performance. For example, some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by the excellence of the music, its rendition or its interpretation (5, 8). Other audiences of live performances are entertained by the ambience and the chance to participate (7, 9). Even more listeners are entertained by pre-recorded music and listen privately (10).|$|E
5|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this method}} {{is that it can}} be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are. Because of <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> <b>variety</b> of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies {{are more likely to be}} considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area and in other parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was also}} positively received; for example, Hendrix from GamePro shared his {{opinion that the}} game did well with management of the games time. Nelson and Hendrix from IGN and GamePro both emphasized their enjoyment of the games action elements. GameSpot, while feeling that the action elements were {{the primary focus of}} the game, still liked <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> <b>variety</b> of role-playing elements present. Nelson from IGN, however, wished that the role-playing elements had been reduced even further in favor of the action parts of the game. All three reviewers compared the game to The Legend of Zelda, such as Mielke from GameSpot who had discussed the game to release as a direct competitor to that series. Both GameSpot and IGN felt that the comparison was invalid, as Musashi focused much more on action than role-playing, resulting in a game that was not a direct competitor at all.|$|E
