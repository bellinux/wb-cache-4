5|$|Australian ravens begin {{breeding}} {{once they}} are three years old. Breeding season is from July to September, with no substantial difference in timing across its range around the country despite it inhabiting a range of diverse climates and habitats across 19 degrees of latitude. Rowley has pointed out this is unusual for a bird species {{with a wide range}} and has postulated that breeding is initiated by day length. Rarely, breeding can take place in May, June or October. Australian ravens generally nest in <b>tall</b> <b>trees,</b> never near to the ground as some species do. The nest also functions as a lookout post and so tall or emergent trees are selected. The ravens occasionally nest on buildings, telegraph poles, or tall windmills which allow the species to occupy areas lacking in <b>tall</b> <b>trees.</b> Windmills may have assisted the spread of the species in North Queensland and the Northern Territory. The highest recorded corvid nest in Australia was found atop the AWA Tower in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocids like Apatosaurus {{are often}} portrayed with their necks held {{high up in}} the air, {{allowing}} them to browse on <b>tall</b> <b>trees.</b> Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have allowed the neck to bend far upwards, and that sauropods like Apatosaurus were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} habitats of the Bengal slow loris range across tropical and subtropical regions, {{and include}} evergreen and semi-evergreen rainforests with forest edges and continuous, dense canopies. It {{can also be}} found in bamboo groves. It prefers habitats with larger diameter, <b>tall</b> <b>trees</b> with a large crown depth (defined as the length along the main axis from the tree tip {{to the base of the}} crown); these areas are typically associated with greater food abundance, and decreased risk of predation. Because of its preference for dense forests, it acts as a good indicator of the ecosystem's health.|$|E
50|$|Between December 1996 and August 2000, the <b>tallest</b> <b>tree</b> in Montgomery Woods, {{named the}} Mendocino Tree, was the world's <b>tallest</b> known <b>tree.</b> It was {{displaced}} by {{the discovery of a}} number of <b>taller</b> <b>trees</b> in Humboldt Redwoods State Park and later Redwood National Park in Humboldt County. The tree is one of dozens of similar height in the grove, and was never specifically marked {{in order to protect the}} tree.

5|$|Ale {{have several}} adversaries, {{including}} dragons, zmajeviti (dragon-like) men, eagles, St. Elijah, and St. Sava. The principal {{enemy of the}} ala is the dragon; {{he is able to}} defeat her and eliminate her harmful effects. Dragons are thus seen as guardians of the fields and harvest, and as protectors against bad weather. When an ala threatens by bringing hail clouds, a dragon comes out to fight with her and drive her away. His main weapon is lightning; thunder represents a fight between ale and dragons (during which ale hide in <b>tall</b> <b>trees).</b> An instance of a more abundant crop at a particular point is explained in the Pčinja region {{as a result of a}} dragon having struck an ala with lightning just over that place, making her drop the looted grains she had been carrying in her huge ears. If an ala finds a dragon in a hollow tree, however, she can destroy him by burning the tree.|$|E
5|$|In Florida, nesting {{habitats}} often {{consist of}} mangrove swamps, the shorelines of lakes and rivers, pinelands, seasonally flooded flatwoods, hardwood swamps, and open prairies and pastureland with scattered <b>tall</b> <b>trees.</b> Favored nesting trees in Florida are slash pines (Pinus elliottii), longleaf pines (P. palustris), loblolly pines (P. taeda) and cypress trees, {{but for the}} southern coastal areas where mangroves are usually used. In Wyoming, groves of mature cottonwoods or tall pines found along streams and rivers are typical bald eagle nesting habitats. Wyoming eagles may inhabit habitat types ranging from large, old-growth stands of ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa) to narrow strips of riparian trees surrounded by rangeland. In Southeast Alaska, Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) provided 78% of the nesting trees used by eagles, followed by hemlocks (Tsuga) at 20%. Increasingly, eagles nest in man-made reservoirs stocked with fish.|$|E
5|$|Later, diplodocids {{were often}} portrayed with their necks held {{high up in}} the air, {{allowing}} them to graze from <b>tall</b> <b>trees.</b> Studies using computer models have shown that neutral posture of the neck was horizontal, rather than vertical, and scientists such as Kent Stephens have used this to argue that sauropods including Diplodocus did not raise their heads much above shoulder level. A nuchal ligament may have held the neck in this position. A 2009 study found that all tetrapods appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture, and argued that the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from other animals. One of the sauropod models in this study was Diplodocus, which they found would have held its neck at about a 45° angle with the head pointed downwards in a resting posture.|$|E
40|$|The {{heights of}} 53 trees in 21 putatively tall {{eucalypt}} stands in southern Tasmania were accurately measured. The <b>tallest</b> <b>tree</b> was a 92 m Eucalyptus regnans at the Big Tree Reserve, Styx Valley. This tree is 9 m {{shorter than the}} <b>tallest</b> <b>tree</b> ever recorded in Tasmania. Currently, the ten <b>tallest</b> known <b>trees,</b> including one tree in northern Tasmania, are all at least 85 m tall. Extreme tallness {{is not confined to}} E. regnans, with a 91 m E. viminalis and a 90 m E. delegatensis being almost as tall. Most of the current <b>tallest</b> <b>trees</b> in Tasmania are around 400 years old and senescing {{at a rate of about}} 3 m per decade. This decline will become more rapid once the trees reach their likely maximum life span of 450 years. A stand at Coles Creek, within a large patch of 200 -year-old E. regnans in the World Heritage Area, will probably contain Tasmania’s <b>tallest</b> <b>tree</b> as older, <b>taller</b> <b>trees</b> decline elsewhere. The 92 m tree in the Big Tree Reserve, Styx Valley, appears to be currently the world’s tallest flowering plant in natural forest...|$|R

5|$|Little {{is known}} about this species' behavior. The Congo serpent eagle lives in the {{understory}} of its habitat and occasionally perches on lower boughs in <b>tall</b> <b>trees.</b> It lives either alone or in pairs. This species is known to hunt snakes, lizards, especially chameleons, toads, and potentially small mammals. It hunts by dropping to the ground from its perch in the understory, where it may strike its prey repeatedly with its feet; this serpent eagle may also grab prey from the foliage while hunting. Its large eyes enable this species to hunt in low light, though it is diurnal. Studies on the species' eyes have shown that they have about two times the visual resolution of a human's. It may breed from October to December in Gabon and from June to November in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E
5|$|Radau summarises one {{passage from}} the book after another: the orang utans of Borneo wrestling open the jaws of a crocodile, or killing a python; the Timorese walking up <b>tall</b> <b>trees,</b> leaning back on ropes as they pull {{themselves}} upwards; the indescribable taste of a durian fruit, at once recalling custard, almond paste, roasted onions, sherry {{and a host of}} other things, that melts on the tongue, that one does not want to stop eating; more, the fruit has a repulsive odour, and the tree is dangerous, as the hard and heavy fruits can fall on your head. Radau follows Wallace up to the high plateaux of Java, where there are cypress forests covered in moss and lichen; finally at the summit the vegetation seems European, an island vegetation recalling the resemblance between the plants of the high Alps and of Lapland. And in Celebes, men run amok, generally killing a dozen people before meeting their own death.|$|E
5|$|The {{habitat of}} Paraceratherium {{appears to have}} varied across its range, based on the types of {{geological}} formations {{it has been found}} in. The Hsanda Gol Formation of Mongolia represents an arid desert basin, and the environment is thought to have had few <b>tall</b> <b>trees</b> and limited brush cover, as the fauna consisted mainly of animals that fed from tree tops or close to the ground. A study of fossil pollen showed that much of China was woody shrubland, with plants such as saltbush, mormon tea (Ephedra), and nitre bush (Nitraria), all adapted to arid environments. Trees were rare, and concentrated near groundwater. The parts of China where Paraceratherium lived had dry lakes and abundant sand dunes, and the most common plant fossils are leaves of the desert-adapted Palibinia. Trees in Mongolia and China included birch, elm, oaks, and other deciduous trees, while Siberia and Kazakhstan also had walnut trees. Dera Bugti in Pakistan had dry, temperate to subtropical forest.|$|E

5|$|The male red-tailed black {{cockatoo}} courts by puffing up crest and cheek feathers, {{and hiding}} the beak; it then sings and struts, {{ending in a}} jump and a flash of red tail feathers toward the female who will most often reply by defensively biting him. Breeding generally takes place from May to September except {{in the case of}} the South-eastern subspecies, which nests during summer (December to February). Pairs of the subspecies samueli in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia may produce two broods, while those of South-eastern subspecies only produce one. Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of <b>tall</b> <b>trees.</b> Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. The same tree may be used for many years. Hollows can be 1 to 2metres (3–7ft) deep and 0.25–0.5metres (10–20in) wide, with a base of woodchips. A clutch consists of 1 to 2 white, lustreless eggs, although the second chick is in most cases neglected and perishes in infancy.|$|E
5|$|Granger and Gregory {{argued that}} the large incisors were used for defence or for {{loosening}} shrubs by moving the neck downwards, thereby acting as picks and levers. Tapirs use their proboscis to wrap around branches while stripping off bark with the front teeth; this ability would have been helpful to Paraceratherium. Some Russian authors suggested that the tusks were probably used for breaking twigs, stripping bark and bending high branches and that, because species from the early Oligocene had larger tusks than later ones, they probably had a more bark than leaf based diet. Since the species involved are now {{known to have been}} contemporaneous, and that the differences in tusks are perhaps sexually dimorphic, the latter idea is not accepted today. Herds of Paraceratherium may have migrated while continuously foraging from <b>tall</b> <b>trees,</b> which smaller mammals could not reach. Osborn suggested that its mode of foraging would have been {{similar to that of the}} high-browsing giraffe and okapi, rather than to modern rhinoceroses, whose heads are carried close to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Patterns {{can form}} {{for other reasons}} in the vegetated {{landscape}} of tiger bush and fir waves. Tiger bush stripes occur on arid slopes where plant growth is limited by rainfall. Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation effectively collects the rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it. Fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn {{more likely to be}} damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind. Meanwhile, on the windward side, young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining <b>tall</b> <b>trees.</b> Natural patterns are sometimes formed by animals, as in the Mima mounds of the Northwestern United States and some other areas, which appear to be created over many years by the burrowing activities of pocket gophers, while the so-called fairy circles of Namibia appear to be created by the interaction of competing groups of sand termites, along with competition for water among the desert plants.|$|E

5|$|The {{breeding}} season {{varies according to}} latitude, taking place from April to July in Queensland, January to May in northern New South Wales, December to February in southern New South Wales, and October to February in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The male yellow-tailed black cockatoo courts by puffing up crest and spreading his tail feathers to display his yellow plumage. Softly growling, he approaches the female and bows {{three or four times}} to her. His eye ring may also flush a deeper pink. Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of <b>tall</b> <b>trees,</b> generally eucalypts, which are either living or dead. Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. The same tree may be used for many years. A 1994 study of nesting sites in Eucalyptus regnans forest in the Strzelecki Ranges in eastern Victoria found the average age of trees used for hollows by the yellow-tailed black cockatoo to be 228 years. The authors noted that the proposed 80–150 year rotation time for managed forests would impact on the numbers of suitable trees.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle usually chooses <b>tall</b> <b>trees</b> or {{man-made}} pylons to nest in. Often, {{locations are}} sought {{where there is}} a tall dead tree or high branch with good visibility which {{can be used as a}} perch to survey the surrounding area, which is generally a low-lying locale near water with some forest cover. The perch becomes covered in faeces and pellets and animal remains litter the immediate surrounding area. The nest is a large deep bowl constructed of sticks and branches, and lined with such materials as grass or seaweed. Yearly renovations result in nests getting gradually bigger. Nests are generally sited in the forks of large trees overlooking bodies of water. Old nests of wedge-tailed eagles or whistling kites have been renovated and used. Cliffs are also suitable nesting sites, and on islands nests are sometimes built directly on the ground. A breeding pair, with the male being more active, spends three to six weeks building or renovating the nest before laying eggs. Normally a clutch of two dull, white, oval eggs are laid. Measuring 73×55mm, they are incubated over six weeks before hatching. The young are semi-altricial, and covered in white down when they emerge from the egg. Initially, the male brings food and the female feeds the chicks, but both parents feed the chicks as they grow larger. Although two eggs are laid, it is unusual for two young to be reared successfully to fledging (leaving the nest). One egg may be infertile, or the second chick may die in the nest. If the first clutch is lost, the parents may attempt a second brood. Nestlings have been recorded fledging when 70 to 80 days old, and remaining around the parents' territory for up to six months or until the following breeding season.|$|E
