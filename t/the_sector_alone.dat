40|$|In the {{literature}} of comprehensive national accounts, national net investments are used to indicate dynamic welfare improvement in an economy. A well-known approach associates national net investments with the shadow value of change in stock of capital assets in an economy. Following this capital stock approach, sectoral net investments {{can be defined as}} the shadow value of change in stock of capital assets owned by a sector in an economy. An alternative approach is based on future commodity flows to a sector. This commodity flow approach associates sectoral net investments with the present value of changes in future commodity flows to a sector.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this study}} we aimed at {{answering}} the question, ‘Does agriculture matter for economic development in Nigeria? ’ Life expectancy is modeled against agricultural output and agricultural expenditure, amongst other variables. Agricultural output is also modeled against a host of socio-economic, natural and human factors, which influence agricultural productivity. Applying Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test, Ordinary Least Squares, and the Newey-West method on secondary data and dummy variable used in the study, {{it was found that}} agricultural output has negative and significant impact on life expectancy in Nigeria. The impact of agricultural expenditure was found to be positive but nonsignificant. Real gross domestic product and industrial output were also found to influence life expectancy. Careful examination of the hypothesized socio-economic factors (political instability and industrial output), natural factor (rainfall), and human factor (carbon emission) showed that only industrial output and rainfall matter for agricultural output in the country: both variables have positive impacts on agricultural output. The study submits that as much as agriculture may matter for economic development, reliance on <b>the</b> <b>sector</b> <b>alone</b> without corresponding and simultaneous development of other crucial sectors such as education, health, and industry will not yield positive fruits for economic development in Nigeria...|$|E

40|$|It is {{encouraging}} {{to note that}} in recent years major cities in Southeast Asia have become more conscious of the presence of the informal sector which {{has become part of the}} underlying image of most Asian cities. The sheer size of <b>the</b> <b>sector</b> <b>alone</b> showed how important it is to the countries involved in this region with respect to issues such as unemployment and urban poverty. While the theory based on survival strategy remains to be widely prevalent in explaining the development of the sector, recent studies have started to associate the growing presence of the sector with the logic of productive decentralization (Portes, Castells and Benton, 1989). At present in Malaysia, hawking constitutes the bulk of informal sector activities in major urban areas. Hawkers are seen as effective and efficient agents in the distribution of goods and services through their linkage with the formal sector. They help to keep the cost of living in the city low by providing food and other consumer items at affordable prices and widen consumer choice. Hawking in another sense is part of the Malaysian culture to be promoted. The challenges however, remain in its management and control which involves considerations such as health, cleanliness, aesthetics and safety issues. This paper will trace the changing characteristics of the street hawkers in Kuala Lumpur since the 1970 s. While the paper makes no unmistakable account of the roles and contributions of hawking activities to urban living there it also highlights the main issues relating to their sustainable existence. The paper will also evaluate the current strategies of managing the street hawkers in Kuala Lumpur which were mostly by relocation and upgrading exercises...|$|E

Usually it provides a considerable share towards the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross National Product (GNP) of the economy.

Also it helps to evaluate the structures of government policies, their effectiveness as well as direct and indirect impact of social wellbeing in the country. This study focuses on the causality relationship between the developments of construction activities and the GDP Growth in Sri Lanka. It describes as a country how construction activities have been responded to the trend of national economy and vice versa. Empirical data of economic indicators and construction index were used to determine the Granger Causality Test for the period of 1990 to 2013. Therefore, it checked the associations between national economic statistics and construction activates in Sri Lanka specially to identify unidirectional and bidirectional relationships among the variables as well as short term and long term relationships. The research reveals the Balance of Trade (BOT) has a relationship between previous year Gross Domestic Products (GDP) and a year before.

40|$|The NPO {{sector has}} become a {{dominant}} economic force all over the world. With a base of more than 100 000 NPOs in South Africa, this sector, {{also known as the}} third sector, {{has become a}} force with which all in South Africa need to reckon. The size of <b>the</b> <b>sector</b> <b>alone</b> is an indication of the critically important role it plays in the development sector in our country. I have been working in the non-profit sector for more than 25 years. With this experience as background, my opinion is that the effect of the exponential growth of the sector is that NPOs are now sharing the market with for-profit corporations and public agencies. In almost all markets, NPOs face increasing competition – competition that has intensified the pressure these organisations face to find effective management methods. For survival and self-sustainability, it is imperative for NPOs to adopt the managerial techniques and systems of the for-profit corporations. It is my view that the implementation and management of corporate branding can contribute positively to improve communications and relationships with the internal and external audiences of NPOs {{in the same way as}} for-profit organisations. To prove this viewpoint I decided to use a case study focus to allow me to analyse the content of the corporate communication strategy of the Girl Guides Association of South Africa (GGASA) as a non-profit organisation. Following this approach, I endeavoured to establish the role which branding is playing in the organisation and how it can market itself to its internal and external audiences by using the organisation’s corporate brand. Three data collection methods were used, namely, document analysis semi-structured interviews and focus groups. Based on the above, the main research question for this study has been formulated as: “How can the GGASA develop/manage its corporate brand to communicate its image effectively to internal and external audiences?” Four sub-questions were formulated, focussing specifically on: the aims of the communication of the corporate branding; identity and image programme of the GGASA; the principles on which the communication of the corporate branding, identity and image programme of GGASA are based; the characteristics of the communication of the corporate branding, identity and image programme of the GGASA and what the perceptions of the internal and external audience are of the communication of the corporate branding, identity and image programme of the GGASA. In an attempt to answer this research question I endeavoured to link three theories, namely corporate communication, social marketing and branding in order to describe their integration within the NPO sector. By following this approach, a case can be made out that social marketing and corporate communication in the NPO sector is just as important as the organisation’s core service delivery business. Secondly, if an NPO is not sure what its brand is all about, such an organisation would be unable to implement any effective social marketing and/or strategic corporate communication, bearing in mind that the brand is the core and essence of an NPO and the pivot of all these actions. I am of the opinion that should the key recommendations of this study be put in place by the management of the GGASA, it will improve the implementation of its corporate communication, more specifically the corporate identity, image and brand management processes. This will in turn lead to an improvement in the effectiveness of the organisation’s communication and the achievement of its developmental objectives, which will enable them to position themselves as one of the new superbrands in South Africa, with real power to act on behalf of a perceived common good. In my opinion, the inclusion of recommendations provided by the GGASA target audiences during the field research enriched my own conclusions and recommendations. The recommendations were further formulated in such a way, that they could form the basis of a workable implementation plan for the management of the GGASA. This factor further enhances the value of the study. Dissertation (MA (Development Communication)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007. Information Scienceunrestricte...|$|E

40|$|Background: Antimicrobial {{resistance}} (AMR) is, {{at least}} in part, associated with high antimicrobial usage and causes increased morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs.
