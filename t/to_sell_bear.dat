50|$|The Preceptory gained {{somewhat}} of a reputation for fraud and abusing their privileges during the 13th and 14th centuries. The preceptory gained land in Compton {{on the outskirts of}} the town of Ashbourne, Derbyshire; but the Hospitallers were unpopular in the town (at the time a Royal Borough), and the complaints are recorded as early as 1276. Their privileges included certifying as correct the gallon and bushel measures: they abused this privilege by allowing their tenants <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> bread and <b>bear</b> in false measures. The Hospitallers were also able to extend their privileges, such as freedom from road and bridge tolls, to their tenants; this further aided their unpopularity as the royal borough of Ashbourne was seen to suffer as the Hospitallers increased their number of tenants and profiteered further. Similar dodgy dealings occurred in 1330 when a brother of the order, William Brix, slammed the door of the manor house at Barlow in the face of the Sheriff's Officer who had come to check the order's weights and measures.|$|R
