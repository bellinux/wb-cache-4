5|$|One of {{the major}} {{applications}} of sintered silicon nitride is in automobile industry as a material for engine parts. Those include, in diesel engines, glowplugs for faster start-up; precombustion chambers (swirl chambers) for lower emissions, faster start-up and lower noise; <b>turbocharger</b> for reduced engine lag and emissions. In spark-ignition engines, silicon nitride is used for rocker arm pads for lower wear, <b>turbocharger</b> for lower inertia and less engine lag, and in exhaust gas control valves for increased acceleration. As examples of production levels, there is an estimated more than 300,000 sintered silicon nitride turbochargers made annually.|$|E

In August 2014, Toyota announced it would be cutting its Lexus spare parts prices in China by up to 35 percent. The company admitted the move {{was in response to}} a probe foreshadowed earlier in the month by China's National Development and Reform Commission of Lexus spare parts policies, as part of an industry-wide investigation into what the Chinese regulator considers exorbitantly high prices being charged by automakers for spare parts and after-sales servicing.|$|E
5|$|Graves, {{who fell}} to second in class, went into Rivage's gravel trap with a left-front brake failure, {{causing him to}} retire. Toyota retired their No. 6 entry from the race because of an engine failure caused by an {{electrical}} fault. Smoke bellowed from the rear-end of Nakajima's Toyota upon leaving La Source and he {{went back into the}} pit lane where his mechanics worked on rectifying the problem allowing Oliver Jarvis in the No. 8 Audi to inherit the lead. Webber drove straight at the Bus Stop chicane, spun, and drove into the pit lane. Stefan Mücke, who was affected by <b>turbocharger</b> issues, lost control of the No. 66 Ford after one of his rear tyres was punctured, and narrowly avoided going airborne. The vehicle made heavy contact with the left-hand side barriers at Raidillon, heavily damaging the front-end and removing both of its doors, as well as littering debris onto the circuit. His car stopped in the centre of the track, causing the No. 2 Porsche to swerve to avoid hitting the vehicle, and the safety car was deployed to allow marshals to repair the heavily damaged tyre barrier. Drivers were instructed to steer onto the right-hand side of the track at Eau Rouge because the stranded car blocked the turn. Mücke was transported to the track's medical centre and later taken to the local hospital for a precautionary check-up because of bruising.|$|E

25|$|The {{primary use}} of this valve is to {{maintain}} the spinning of the <b>turbocharger</b> at a high speed. The air is usually recycled back into the <b>turbocharger</b> inlet (diverter or bypass valves), but can also be vented to the atmosphere (blow off valve). Recycling back into the <b>turbocharger</b> inlet is required on an engine that uses a mass-airflow fuel injection system, because dumping the excessive air overboard downstream of the mass airflow sensor causes an excessively rich fuel mixture—because the mass-airflow sensor has already accounted for the extra air {{that is no longer}} being used. Valves that recycle the air also shorten the time needed to re-spool the <b>turbocharger</b> after sudden engine deceleration, since load on the <b>turbocharger</b> when the valve is active is much lower than if the air charge vents to atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|Electrical {{boosting}} ("E-boosting") is a {{new technology}} under development. It uses an electric motor to bring the <b>turbocharger</b> up to operating speed quicker than possible using available exhaust gases. An alternative to e-boosting is to completely separate the turbine and compressor into a turbine-generator and electric-compressor as in the hybrid <b>turbocharger.</b> This makes compressor speed independent of turbine speed. In 1981, a similar system that used a hydraulic drive system and overspeed clutch arrangement accelerated the <b>turbocharger</b> of the MV Canadian Pioneer (Doxford 76J4CR engine).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. By {{comparing}} {{the characteristics of}} various <b>turbocharging</b> system, then hybird <b>turbocharging</b> system is proposed. In principle the technical approach of hybrid <b>turbocharging</b> system is analyzed to solve the steady and transient condition problem about vehicle diesel engine. Then several modes of energy flow about hybrid <b>turbocharging</b> system are analyzed, and calculation processes about each share of the energy flow are given. According to the characteristic of <b>turbocharged</b> diesel engine, the energy flow distribution of the two typical engine conditons is calculated. Analysis of energy flow is of great significance to properly distribute the energy share and improve {{the performance of the}} <b>turbocharging</b> system...|$|R
25|$|<b>Turbocharger</b> lag (turbo lag) is {{the time}} {{required}} to change power output in response to a throttle change, noticed as a hesitation or slowed throttle response when accelerating as compared to a naturally aspirated engine. This is due to the time needed for the exhaust system and <b>turbocharger</b> to generate the required boost which can also be referred to as spooling. Inertia, friction, and compressor load are the primary contributors to <b>turbocharger</b> lag. Superchargers do not suffer this problem, because the turbine is eliminated due to the compressor being directly powered by the engine.|$|E
25|$|Variable-geometry or variable-nozzle turbochargers use {{moveable}} vanes {{to adjust}} the air-flow to the turbine, imitating a <b>turbocharger</b> of the optimal size throughout the power curve. The vanes are placed {{just in front of}} the turbine like a set of slightly overlapping walls. Their angle is adjusted by an actuator to block or increase air flow to the turbine. This variability maintains a comparable exhaust velocity and back pressure throughout the engine’s rev range. The result is that the <b>turbocharger</b> improves fuel efficiency without a noticeable level of <b>turbocharger</b> lag.|$|E
25|$|A <b>turbocharger</b> {{remedies}} {{this problem}} by compressing the air back to sea-level pressures (turbo-normalizing), or even much higher (turbo-charging), {{in order to produce}} rated power at high altitude. Since the size of the <b>turbocharger</b> is chosen to produce a given amount of pressure at high altitude, the <b>turbocharger</b> is oversized for low altitude. The speed of the <b>turbocharger</b> is controlled by a wastegate. Early systems used a fixed wastegate, resulting in a <b>turbocharger</b> that functioned much like a supercharger. Later systems utilized an adjustable wastegate, controlled either manually by the pilot or by an automatic hydraulic or electric system. When the aircraft is at low altitude the wastegate is usually fully open, venting all the exhaust gases overboard. As the aircraft climbs and the air density drops, the wastegate must continuously close in small increments to maintain full power. The altitude at which the wastegate fully closes and the engine still produces full power is the critical altitude. When the aircraft climbs above the critical altitude, engine power output decreases as altitude increases, just as it would in a naturally aspirated engine.|$|E

25|$|Air intake takes {{directly}} from the engine room to the <b>turbocharger</b> fitted to the engines. From the <b>turbocharger,</b> air is sent to be cooled through a sea water cooler then stored in a scavenge air receiver. This air is then sent to the scavenge ports on the cylinder liners.|$|E
25|$|The boost {{threshold}} of a <b>turbocharger</b> {{system is the}} lower bound of the region within which the compressor operates. Below a certain rate of flow, a compressor produces insignificant boost. This limits boost at a particular RPM, regardless of exhaust gas pressure. Newer <b>turbocharger</b> and engine developments have steadily reduced boost thresholds.|$|E
25|$|All 567 engines utilize forced induction, {{with either}} a Roots blower or a <b>turbocharger.</b> The <b>turbocharger</b> (a {{combination}} turbo-compressor system) follows EMD's innovative design that uses a gear train and over-running clutch to drive the compressor rotor during low engine speed, when exhaust gas temperature (and, correspondingly, heat energy) alone is insufficient to drive the turbine. At higher engine speeds, increased exhaust gas temperature is sufficient to drive the turbine and the clutch disengages, turning the turbo-compressor system into a true <b>turbocharger.</b> The turbo-compressor can revert to compressor mode momentarily during demands for large increases in engine output power. While more expensive to maintain than Roots blowers, the <b>turbocharger</b> significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions, while improving high-altitude performance. Additionally, EMD's turbo-compressor can provide a 50 percent increase in maximum rated horsepower over Roots-blown engines for the same engine displacement.|$|E

25|$|With older {{supercharged}} aircraft, {{the pilot}} must continually adjust the throttle {{to maintain the}} required manifold pressure during ascent or descent.
