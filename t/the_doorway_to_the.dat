5|$|Early in the 18th century, John Hylton (died 1712), {{the second}} son of Henry Hylton, de jure 16th Baron Hylton, gutted the {{interior}} {{to form a}} three-storeyed block (one room on each floor). He also inserted large, alternating, pedimented sash windows in the Italianate style and added a three-storeyed north wing to the castle (as seen in Bucks' engraving of 1728). A doorway to the new wing was added and approached by a semi-circular staircase. Above the doorway was a coat of arms, {{believed to be the}} one created to commemorate the marriage between John Hylton and his wife, Dorothy Musgrave. It is now located above <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Golden Lion Inn at South Hylton, {{on the opposite side of}} the River Wear.|$|E
5|$|Sutton Court {{is built}} of squared and coursed {{sandstone}} rubble throughout with freestone and ashlar dressings, copings, slate roofs. The north front comprises a central three-storey fourteenth century pele tower with a taller circular stair turret and two-storey ranges linking {{it to the}} 1558 'Bess of Hardwick Building' {{to the left and}} a four bay 1858–1860 servants' wing of three storeys to the right. Windows to the pele tower and right-hand linking range are 15th century, of two cusped lights with hood moulds, some of which have been renewed, and some relocated from other areas. <b>The</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tower dates from 1858–60.

25|$|The Missouri River {{provided}} the initial {{source of revenue}} for young Omaha, as fur trappers such as Manuel Lisa used <b>the</b> area <b>to</b> build their inland empires with local Native American tribes. As steamboats started pouring in goods manufactured in the Eastern United States, {{thousands of tons of}} goods came through the city. However, the problem of transporting materials for the growing Midwestern United States needed to be addressed, which luckily opened <b>the</b> <b>doorways</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city's major growth engine in its earliest years. The second period of growth in Omaha, from approximately 1865 through the 1880s, is attributed solely <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city's railroad connections, which drew almost all significant rail traffic from the Pacific Northwest through the area. By the 1870s, Omaha had seven major rail lines.|$|R

500|$|After the sea {{undermined}} {{the foundations of}} the Hoy and Anchor Inn at Reculver in January 1808, the building was taken down and the redundant vicarage was used as a temporary replacement under the same name. Although it was reported in 1800 that there were then only five or six houses left in the village, a new Hoy and Anchor Inn was built by 1809, and this was renamed as the King Ethelbert Inn by 1838. Further construction work is indicated by a stone over <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inn bearing a date of 1843, and it was later extended into the form in which it stands today, [...] "probably... in 1883".|$|E

500|$|From 1957 to 1962 Kerst was {{employed}} at the General Atomics division of General Dynamics's John Jay Hopkins Laboratory for Pure and Applied Science in La Jolla, California, {{where he worked}} on plasma physics, which it was hoped was <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> control of thermonuclear energy. With Tihiro Ohkawa he invented toroidal devices for containing the plasma with magnetic fields. The two completed this work at the University of Wisconsin, where Kerst was a professor from 1962 {{until his retirement in}} 1980. Their devices were the first to contain plasma without the instabilities that had plagued previous designs, and the first to contain plasma for lifetimes exceeding the Bohm diffusion limit. [...] From 1972 to 1973 he was also chairman of the Plasma Physics Division of the American Physical Society.|$|E
500|$|The Entrance Hall, {{which is}} in the east range, was remodelled by Leoni. It is {{asymmetrical}} and contains giant pilasters and a screen of three fluted Ionic columns. <b>The</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> courtyard has an open pediment. A hinged picture can be swung out from the wall to reveal a squint looking into the Entrance Hall. [...] Also in the Entrance Hall are tapestries which were woven at Mortlake between 1623 and 1636. They were originally in the Leghs' London home in Belgrave Square and were moved to Lyme in 1903. In order to accommodate them, the interior decorator, Amadée Joubert, had to make alterations, including the removal of a tabernacle and cutting out four of the pilasters. To the south of the Entrance Hall is the Library, and to the east is Wyatt's Dining Room, which has a stucco ceiling and a carved overmantel both in a late 17th-century style, as well as a frieze. The decoration of this room {{is considered to be a}} rare early example of the Wrenaissance style.|$|E
500|$|The {{rectangular}} church, {{which has}} been described as [...] "tiny", is said by the Diocese of Bangor to be the second-smallest church in Anglesey. The nave and chancel (which are not divided) measure together 34feet 9inches by 14feet (about 10.6m by 4.3m). The church is constructed of rubble masonry, dressed with freestone and with a foundation of boulders. The roof, which has a bellcote at the west end, is made of slate; the roof timbers can be seen from inside. [...] The only bell, which is dated 1747, is decorated with a vine scroll. The door to the church is on the north side through a porch; <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> porch has a rounded head and a 15th-century style doorjamb, but the porch itself is more modern. The windows in the nave (one in the north wall, one in the west wall and two in the south wall) have rounded tops. [...] The window at the east end of the church, which dates from the late 16th century, is rectangular with three arched lights (vertical sections) set in a square frame. The lights are separated by mullions and there is an external hoodmould above the window.|$|E

500|$|Final Fantasy Agito {{takes place}} in Orience, a land divided between four nations, or Crystal States, which have existed {{in a state of}} near-constant war for the past {{thousand}} years: the Dominion of Rubrum, the Militesi Empire, the Kingdom of Concordia and the Lorican Alliance. The cause of the war is the nation's crystals, objects of magical and political power that bestow different blessings on each nation, and choose people to become magical warriors known as l'Cie, which serve and protect their respective crystal. The land of Orience is locked in a stable time loop, whereby events repeat constantly, then reset and begin all over again with minor variations. The reason is an experiment set up by the deities Pulse and Lindzei to find <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> afterlife for their creator. The time in which Agito occurs is referred to as [...] "the first cycle that surpasses the spiral of 600 million", being {{at the very beginning of}} Orience's spiral of repeating history. Agitos initial events differ from Type-0 as it was to have been directed to a history were the Agito is born, making it an alternate story using the same setting. The game's events across its lifetime are split across two [...] "phases", or cycles of Orience's history. A key event at the end of each cycle is Tempus Finis, an event in which Orience is destined to end and be reborn.|$|E
500|$|The archaeological remains are {{recognised}} as a GradeI {{listed building}} and a scheduled ancient monument, and {{are considered to}} be the most important monastic remains in Cheshire. [...] They consist of the former undercroft and the foundations of the church and monastic buildings that were exposed during the excavations. The undercroft stands outside the museum building. It is a single-storey structure consisting of seven pairs of bays divided into two compartments, one of four and the other of three bays. It is entered through the portico added to the west front of the country house in 1886 by way of a pair of arched doorways in Norman style. <b>The</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right (south) is original, dating from the late 12thcentury, while the other doorway is a replica dated 1886. The older doorway has been described as [...] "the finest decorated Norman doorway in Cheshire". It is in good condition with little evidence of erosion and Greene considers that this is because it has always been protected from the weather. The portico leads into the four-bay compartment. This has a tiled floor and contains a medieval-style fireplace. The roof is ribbed vaulted. On the east wall is a two-arched doorway leading to the former cloisters. To the north another archway leads to the three-bay compartment. This also has a tile floor and contains the brick wine bins added in the 1780s. The roof of this compartment has groined vaults. The undercroft also contains a bell mould, reconstructed from the fragments of the original mould found in the excavations.|$|E
500|$|Mount Washington {{continued}} FM broadcasting in 1958 {{with the}} construction of WMTW-FM 94.9, which became WHOM in 1976. WHOM and WMTW-TV shared a transmitter building, which also housed the generators to supply power to the mountain. A second radio station moved to the summit in 1987. WPKQ-FM (then known as WMOU) installed its transmitters in the Yankee building and constructed a new broadcast tower behind the building which is the tallest structure on the summit. On February9, 2003, a fire broke out in the generator room of the WMTW/WHOM transmitter building, which had become the property of the state only a year earlier when WMTW left the summit. Though WMTW had left, the building at the time still had WHOM's transmitters inside it. The fire destroyed the building, including WHOM's transmitters, as well as the summit's main generators, and also spread to the adjacent Old Yankee Power House building which housed the emergency generator, destroying that building also and disrupting all power to the summit. Temporary generators had to be transported up the mountain to restore power to the observatory and to the Yankee building, which houses important public safety communications equipment. A makeshift generator room was constructed underneath the canopy of the Sherman Adams building across from the public entrance to replace the destroyed buildings. The makeshift generator room was later made permanent when power cables were installed in 2009, delivering grid power to the summit for the first time. The old sign from the destroyed Old Yankee Power House building was placed above <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new generator room. WHOM subsequently built a new transmitter building {{on the site of the}} old power building, and also constructed a new standby antenna on the Armstrong tower. (For the first time since 1948, the Armstrong tower was used for broadcasts.) ...|$|E
