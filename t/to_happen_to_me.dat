500|$|Rowe's {{illness and}} Blanchflower's arrival {{together}} signalled {{the end of}} Ramsey's playing career. Ramsey missed matches during the 1954–55 season through injury, and in April 1955 suffered what he called [...] "a terrible roasting" [...] {{at the hands of}} the Leicester City winger Derek Hogg. After Tottenham ended the season in 16th place, Rowe retired permanently; his deputy Jimmy Anderson took over and appointed Nicholson to his coaching staff. When Ramsey was omitted from a post-season tour of Hungary, despite still being club captain, he realised that his time at Tottenham had come to an end. He had played a total of 250 competitive games for Tottenham in all competitions, across six seasons. [...] "I was 35 years old and obviously concerned about my future," [...] he later wrote. [...] "I really didn't know what was going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I knew my days as a player were numbered, and there was only one way things could go for me in this respect—downhill." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison taped {{the basic}} track for {{his version of}} [...] "Far East Man" [...] at Friar Park over August and September 1974, during {{sessions}} for his album Dark Horse. Having [...] "brushed up the lyrics a bit", {{as he puts it}} in I, Me, Mine, Harrison retained Newmark and Weeks from the sessions with Wood, and brought in keyboard player Billy Preston and saxophonist and arranger Tom Scott, both of whom would also be part of his all-American tour band. Leng describes [...] "Far East Man" [...] as [...] "the first Harisong to tap into 1970s soul" [...] and notes the [...] "supreme soul credentials" [...] of Newmark, as the former drummer with Sly and the Family Stone, and Weeks, who had supplied the highly regarded basslines on Donny Hathaway Live (1972). Newmark later recalled of his and Weeks' first sessions for Harrison: [...] "We were completely thrilled to be asked to play on his record … It was the most exciting thing <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I had to keep pinching myself to remember it was real." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{preparing}} the acoustic album, Grohl {{decided that he}} would improve it with guest appearances, and made a list of musicians {{that he would like to}} work with, such as Warren Haynes and Grant Hart. The guests that appeared on the record included Norah Jones, John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin fame, and Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age. John Paul Jones agreed to appear as he was in Los Angeles for the Grammy Awards, and Grohl described his appearance as the [...] "second-greatest thing <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in my life" [...] behind his marriage. Norah Jones was brought for the bossa nova [...] "Virginia Moon" [...] after Grohl heard her record and considered that his song was [...] "her vibe" [...] and Jones' voice [...] "was so smooth and warm that I figured it would work out great with mine." [...] The song features Grohl's guitar technician Joe Beebe on lead guitar as he was the only one in the crew with jazz experience. The Wallflowers' keyboard player Rami Jaffee and that dog.'s violinist Petra Haden also contributed to the album, and were later drafted for the Foo Fighters' touring band. After the album was finished, Grohl stated that he hoped that the Foo Fighters were most remembered for this record, describing it as [...] "just the most fucking kick-ass thing we've ever done", and saying that [...] "If someone asked me which Led Zeppelin album to buy, I would tell them Physical Graffiti, because it has such a wide dynamic and it shows the range that band had. And that's what we wanted to do with this album." ...|$|E

[...] "Eighteenpence is 'er price for telling the future only, and, being curious and feeling I'd like to know what's going <b>to</b> <b>'appen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I went in and had eighteenpennorth." ...|$|R
5000|$|And if, my son, <b>to</b> <b>me</b> comes death, and if, my son, illness <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> ...|$|R

2500|$|Fraser later recollected that as {{he drove}} Bonin home, Bonin made a {{statement}} which he (Fraser) had interpreted {{at the time as}} an expression of remorse: [...] "No one's going to testify again. This is never going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> again." ...|$|E
2500|$|King {{received}} frequent {{death threats}} {{due to his}} prominence in the Civil Rights Movement. He had confronted {{the risk of death}} and made that recognition part of his philosophy. He taught that murder could not stop the struggle for equal rights. After the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, King told his wife Coretta, [...] "This is what is going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> also. I keep telling you, this is a sick society." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{his parents}} separated, his mother {{traveled}} seeking employment, and young Langston Hughes was raised mainly in Lawrence, Kansas by his maternal grandmother, Mary Patterson Langston. Through the black American oral tradition and drawing from the activist experiences of her generation, Mary Langston instilled in her grandson a lasting sense of racial pride. He {{spent most of}} his childhood in Lawrence. [...] In his 1940 autobiography The Big Sea he wrote: [...] "I was unhappy for a long time, and very lonesome, living with my grandmother. Then it was that books began <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and I began to believe in nothing but books and the wonderful world in books — where if people suffered, they suffered in beautiful language, not in monosyllables, as we did in Kansas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't seem <b>to</b> {{care what}} <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Don't {{you see that}} this affects your {{interests}} as much as mine? It's no joking matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understood}} {{that you had}} left Las Palmas, and Jefferson was {{on the point of}} doing so. I could scarcely suppose there was any one else who cared enough about what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make it necessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Something seems <b>to</b> have <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in {{the last}} few minutes," [...] she said, [...] "and I can't think clearly. A little while ago it didn't seem to matter much. I liked him. He was good-looking and good-tempered. I felt that we should get along quite well and be as happy as most people are. That seemed as near {{perfection}} as one could expect to get nowadays, so--well, that's how it was." ...|$|R
60|$|Don't be an idiot, my dear; {{nothing is}} going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|Now {{my heart}} began to sink and I asked Houman what was <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Everything had <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> learn ... Dad had to die, Ben had to die, I had {{to lose my}} kids. I had to be humbled. I was too {{angry and}} I had to be {{crippled}} and put on my knees to finally realise I'm not in charge.|$|R
60|$|He declined. This lack of {{confidence}} on his part created a coldness between us, and from that time forward I avoided him. It was my idea, in case anything <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> so time the occurrence as to throw my custom {{into the hands of}} the opposition coroner on the American side.|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't got no {{name for}} my novel. I {{intended}} to think one out to-night. I wrote this all of nights. And I don't {{read the first}} chapters, for they tell about my birth and my parentage and my early adventures. I'll just come down <b>to</b> what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> while you was away, because you'll be more anxious to hear about that. All that's written here is true, jus' the same as if I told it to you, but I've put it into novel language {{because it seems to}} come easier to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have a fancy," [...] he {{said over}} his coffee, [...] "that {{something}} is going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to-day." [...] He spoke--as he moved and thought--slowly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I. Don't {{you know}} what is <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> Ah! Flora has not told you. I thought she would not think it grand enough. She talked about diplomacy--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's not {{the sort}} of talk I understand," [...] he {{declared}} curtly. [...] "Let us understand one another, if we can. What is <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> if I refuse to give you that word?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... [The {{remainder}} of this essay contains a discussion of questions of taxonomy and phylogeny, which is now antiquated. I have reprinted the considerations about the reconciliation of Teleology with Morphology, about [...] "Dysteleology," [...] and about the struggle for existence within the organism, because it has <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be charged with overlooking them.|$|R
5000|$|..... I {{would like}} to believe in reincarnation. I {{would like to}} believe that there is another life. I think that {{sometimes}} your consciousness can happen on this earth a second time around. For me, I wrote Higher Ground even before the accident. But something must have been telling me that something was going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> make <b>me</b> aware of a lot of things and to get myself together. This is like my second chance for life, to do something or to do more, and to value the fact that I am alive. Stevie Wonder ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I {{can tell you}} exactly what the {{questions}} were," [...] Arnold continued, [...] "because they concerned some matters in which Mrs. Weatherley and her brother were chiefly concerned. To tell you the truth, ever since that night when I went to Hampstead to dine, the oddest things seem <b>to</b> have <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I have <b>to</b> pinch myself sometimes to realize that this is London and that I am a clerk in the office of a wholesale provision merchant. When I let myself go, I seem to have been living in an unreal world, full of strange excitements--a veritable Arabian Nights." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. I'm glad I've got the money." [...] Madeline laughed. [...] "What {{a strange}} thing <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me!</b> I wonder what dad would say to that? Stewart, I'm afraid he'd say two {{thousand}} dollars is more than I'm worth. But tell me. That rebel chieftain did not demand money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Parliament {{has been}} the grave of so many men's careers," [...] Maraton continued. [...] "I am fully warned. Nothing of the sort is going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I wouldn't have gone in now but for Foley. It's only fair. It helps him, and he's {{sticking}} to his pledges like a man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, in {{my heart}} I grew afraid, but none would tell me more of this Murgh or what was likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at his hands. Still, I would not show any fear, and, strong in the faith of Christ, I {{determined}} to look upon this idol, for such I expected him to be.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} that I should go through this scene {{by way of a}} joke? I never was so much in earnest in my life before. I am in love with her, I tell you, as much in love as though I had known her for years. What <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> you with {{reference}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> has <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with reference <b>to</b> her, or something very like it, and marry her I must and will." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{shook his}} head sadly. [...] "No 'ope for 'er. The best she cawn do is the work'ouse, an' that's 'ell. An' if she don't go to the work'ouse, it'll be a worse 'ell. Come along 'ith me an' I'll show you women sleepin' in a passage, a dozen of 'em. An' I'll show you worse, wot she'll come <b>to</b> if anythin' <b>'appens</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and the ten shillings." ...|$|R
5000|$|As of 2016, {{the band}} {{have no plans}} to record new material. Neither Schlesinger nor Collingwood have ruled out a future reunion, but both see the {{possibility}} as remote, with Collingwood saying in reference to the experience recording their last album: [...] "I try never to say never, but it’s staggering to think of everything that would have <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> want to repeat that experience." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'As {{to coming}} out {{as strong as}} I could wish, sir,' he confided to Martin in a leisure moment; that is to say, one evening, while he was washing the linen of the establishment, after a hard day's work, 'that I give up. It's a piece of good fortune as never is <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I see!' ...|$|E
60|$|One concession, {{however, the}} vrouw had won from the commandant, who, knowing {{what was about}} <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> had not, I suppose, the heart to refuse. It was that my wife and she might visit me and give me food on the {{stipulation}} that they both left the house where I was confined by ten o'clock that night.|$|E
6000|$|... "I daresay," [...] I broke in, [...] "but, Mavovo, {{be so good}} as {{to leave}} me out of your magic, for I don't at all {{want to know what}} is going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> To-day is enough for me without {{studying}} next month and next year. There is a saying in our holy book which runs: 'Sufficient to the day is its evil.'" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{considered}} for a minute. My first necessity was to secure positive evidence in writing of the discovery that I had just made, and {{in the event of}} any personal misadventure <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> place that evidence beyond Sir Percival's reach. The copy of the register was sure to be safe in Mr. Wansborough's strong room. But the position of the original in the vestry was, as I had seen with my own eyes, anything but secure.|$|R
60|$|HYPATIA. Not at all: {{you were}} very clever. Thats whats so hard to bear, because it makes it so {{difficult}} to avoid listening. You see, I'm young; and I do so want something <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> My mother tells <b>me</b> that when I'm her age, I shall be only too glad that nothing's happened; but I'm not her age; so what good is that <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> Theres my father in the garden, meditating on his destiny. All very well for him: hes had a destiny to meditate on; but I havnt had any destiny yet. Everything's <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him: nothing's <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Thats why this unending talk is so maddeningly uninteresting <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{you will}} expect <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{give you my}} name. I can't do it. I have ceased to bear my family name; and, being out of society, what need have I for an assumed name? As for my Christian name, it's so detestably ugly that I hate the sight and sound of it. Here, they know me as The Lodger. Will you have that? or will you have an {{appropriate}} nick-name? I come of a mixed breed; and I'm likely, after what has <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> turn out a worthless fellow. Call me The Cur.
