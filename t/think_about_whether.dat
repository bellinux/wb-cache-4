5|$|The {{books are}} based on the vampire myth, but Twilight vampires differ in a number of {{particulars}} from the general vampire lore. For instance, Twilight vampires have strong piercing teeth rather than fangs; they glitter in sunlight rather than burn; and they can drink animal as well as human blood. Meyer comments that her vampire mythology differs from that of other authors because she wasn't informed about the canon vampires, saying, It wasn't until I knew that Twilight would be published that I began to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> my vampires were too much the same or too much different from the others. Of course, I was far too invested in my characters at that point to be making changes... so I didn't cut out fangs and coffins and so forth as a way to distinguish my vampires; that's just how they came to me.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{is still}} in a dilemma in who to choose from between CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) and his high school {{sweetheart}} Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore). Avery decides not to be Jack's date to Cerie's wedding, and that while she is gone, Jack should <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> or not he wants to be with her. As soon as Avery leaves, Nancy shows up at the 30 Rock building unannounced, and decides to spend the weekend with Jack. Liz tries {{to talk him out of}} going on a date with Nancy, after he asked her for advice. He decides to keep things platonic with Nancy, so that no problem ensues in his decision to choose between them, but Jack ends up sleeping with Nancy. The next morning, Nancy admits that the two spending the night together was a big deal, as Jack was the first man she slept with after her divorce. At Floyd's wedding, Jack tells Nancy about Avery, and as a result, Nancy threatens to leave him forever once the ceremony is over. While Liz gives a reading, Jack texts her to stall, resulting in Liz reading inappropriate scripture recitations at the wedding.|$|E

When one <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> the barber should shave himself or not, the paradox begins to emerge.|$|R

It's why {{we thought that}} we could reach an especially broad audience with a new film, since the feeling of having your dreams being invaded was something that would translate to any country and any culture." [...] Overall, Bayer {{wanted to create a}} darker Nightmare on Elm Street, one he felt would fit into what he describes as [...] "a darker world". Bayer said there is subtext within the film, which is designed to get the audience to ask, [...] "What makes a monster?" [...] Bayer wants the audience to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> a monster is something that exists purely from a physical appearance—someone with a scarred face and a clawed glove on their hand—or can a monster be something that is deeper, and within the man himself without a scarred face and bladed glove? ...|$|E

Perhaps I haven't altogether made up my mind myself, but I do know this, because it is part of myself and my life. The one desire I have is for children--sons for the State, or daughters who may bear sons. There isn't anything else which it is worth while for a woman thinking about for a moment. And yet, do you know, I never actually think of marrying. I never <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> love is right or wrong. I simply think that no man shall ever kiss me, or hold me in his arms, unless it is the man who is sent to me for my desire, and when he comes, just whoever he may be, or whenever it may be, and whether St. George's opens its doors to us or whether we go through some tangle of words at a registry office, or whether neither of these things happens, I really do not mind. When he comes, he will give me what I want--that is just all that counts. And until he comes, I shall stay just as I have been ever since my pigtail went up and my skirts came down." ...|$|E

Parents need to educate their children and increase their sexual literacy, so that they understand that what they are seeing on the Internet is fantasy.|$|R
50|$|Further, it is {{important}} to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> or not an appropriate dependent variable is being used in an ESM design. For example, it might be logical to use ESM in order to answer research questions which involve dependent variables {{with a great deal of}} variation throughout the day. Thus, variables such as change in mood, change in stress level, or the immediate impact of particular events may be best studied using ESM methodology. However, it is not likely that utilizing ESM will yield meaningful predictions when measuring someone performing a repetitive task throughout the day, when outcomes are long-term in nature (e.g., coronary heart problems), or inherently stable variables.|$|E
50|$|Taking {{this latter}} point one step further, Lewis argues that {{modality}} cannot be made sense of {{without such a}} reduction. He maintains that we cannot determine that x is possible without a conception of what a real world where x holds would look like. In deciding whether {{it is possible for}} basketballs to be inside of atoms we do not simply make a linguistic determination of whether the proposition is grammatically coherent, we actually <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> a real world would be able to sustain such a state of affairs. Thus we require a brand of modal realism if we are to use modality at all.|$|E
