500|$|Madlax {{also plays}} {{as the story}} of Margaret Burton's search for her {{psychological}} identity. Based on the Mashimo Menu theme titles available to her, Yuki Kajiura has suggested an interpretation that while searching for her memories, Margaret meets the other characters ("Gatekeepers") one after another and learns about the lifestyles ("Gates") they represent. In the end, she finds her own [...] "Gate", which is the new identity that finally replaces the one she lost <b>twelve</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E

And then they lit out." [...] Written in archaic English, {{reminiscent}} of the King James Bible translation, it contains parts of Samson's Season 1 prologue, mentions the Avatara, and alludes to an apocalyptic passage in the Book of Revelation. It also contains etchings of a gnarled and bent tree, which in one image is attacked by a Knight Templar holding a knife. Wilfred Talbot Smith interprets this book to Brother Justin, quoting, [...] "By {{the hand of the}} Prince, the Prophet dies. Upon his death, the Prince shall rise," [...] and [...] " [...] Anointed dagger plunge thee deep." [...] Management and Ben repeat these verses independently of Smith.|$|E

500|$|The story {{revolves}} around {{two young women}} who seemingly {{have little in common}} and do not know of the other's existence at the beginning. The eponymous Madlax is a legendary mercenary and assassin in the fictional civil war-torn country of Gazth-Sonika, who cannot remember her past or indeed her real name before <b>twelve</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> when the war started. The other main character is Margaret Burton, the sole heir of a wealthy aristocratic family in the peaceful European country Nafrece. Twelve years before the story begins, an airliner Margaret and her mother were on crashed over Gazth-Sonika, and its passengers, as well as Margaret's father who led the rescuers, have been missing ever since. Margaret, however, mysteriously traveled back to Nafrece on her own, losing her memories prior to her return; the only thing she recalls is a single word, [...] "Madlax". With this thread linking the two girls, they both independently start investigating the powerful crime syndicate Enfant after its enigmatic mastermind shows interest in both of them.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} of Albus Dumbledore {{has been compared}} to other archetypal [...] "wise old man" [...] characters. Dumbledore acts much like Merlin from The Sword in the Stone, in the manner of an [...] "absent-minded professor"; both Merlin and Dumbledore educate a story's main character in a castle. As writer Evelyn Perry notes, [...] "Dumbledore resembles Merlin both personally and physically; he is an avid lover of books and wisdom who wears flowing robes and a long, white beard." [...] Dumbledore has also been compared with Gandalf from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Dave Kopel draws comparisons between Rowling's writing and John Bunyan's The Pilgrim’s Progress and states that, among the Christian symbols that Rowling has used in her books, Dumbledore acts like [...] "the bearded God the Father" [...] figure in which Harry puts his faith to be saved from Voldemort and his servants. IGN also listed Dumbledore as their fifth favourite Harry Potter character, saying that [...] "or a character that was introduced into popular culture a mere <b>twelve</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> it speaks volumes that Professor Dumbledore has already taken his place among the great mentor figures in literature and film". IGN's Joe Utichi called Dumbledore his third favourite Harry Potter character, calling the revelation that he wasn't so [...] "infallible" [...] one of the most heartbreaking themes of the final book. Actor Michael Gambon received some criticism for his louder, more aggressive, portrayal of the character, who is depicted as exhibiting a more subdued, unflappable calm in the books. This has been attributed to Gambon's policy of not reading the source material from which his films are adapted.|$|E

50|$|The {{story is}} set {{sometimes}} in the twenty-first century.

50|$|<b>Twelve</b> million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> the Porco Tuff was {{erupted from}} the volcano, causing the {{formation}} of the Porco caldera.

Material from the pre-caldera basement consisting of Cretaceous sandstone breccia was embedded in the tuff on the southern and eastern side of the caldera.

50|$|As {{recently}} as the Miocene period, <b>twelve</b> million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> the entire watershed of Piner Creek {{was on the floor}} of the Pacific Ocean. After significant volcanic uplift and tectonic movement, the headwaters region of the Mayacmas Mountains emerged above the ocean. Piner Creek was one of the drainages that began to drain the new landmass, in formation of the eventual Santa Rosa Plain, through which the middle and lower reaches of Piner Creek flow. Occasional basaltic outcrops are seen in the upper reach of Piner Creek, betraying the volcanic origin of the Mayacmas Mountains.|$|R

It was made by Buddhist monks, and used by samurai as imperishable wartime food. During the Edo period of the 17th century, a sake dealer promoted it widely. The dish spread throughout Japan and remains popular today. Carrots, watermelon rind, and ginger may also be pickled in this way.|$|R
