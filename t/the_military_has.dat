5|$|Mulder {{is driven}} back to Area 51 {{along with two}} other Men in Black, Howard Grodin and Jeff Smoodge. After an angry {{telephone}} call from Fletcher's wife, Joanne, Mulder—still inside Fletcher's body—goes to Fletcher's home. Instead of sleeping in the bedroom, he decides to sleep downstairs in an easy chair and watch pornography. When he is awoken by Joanne, he mumbles Scully's name. While changing his clothes, Mulder receives {{a telephone call from}} Smoodge, who explains that <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>has</b> surveyed the wreckage of the craft from the night before, finding one of the human pilots merged into a rock but still alive. Another soldier, Captain Robert McDonough, had switched bodies with an elderly Hopi woman, as evident from McDonough's aberrant behavior.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>military</b> <b>has</b> {{historically}} {{played a}} professional, apolitical role in defending {{the country from}} external threats.

50|$|Bainimarama and Leweni {{expressed}} {{mixed feelings}} after the government's decision {{to increase its}} budget allocation to <b>the</b> <b>Military</b> to F$76.4 million was announced on 4 November. The figure represented a considerable increase on the F$67 million allocated in 2004, but fell short of the F$84 million <b>the</b> <b>Military</b> <b>had</b> been seeking. Because <b>the</b> <b>Military</b> <b>had</b> not been allocated all {{that they had been}} seeking, they would continue with their cost-cutting measures, Leweni said.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>military</b> <b>has</b> also {{focused on}} the use of {{renewable}} fuels for military vehicles. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable fuels can be produced in any country, creating a strategic advantage. The US military has already committed itself to have 50% of its energy consumption come from alternative sources.|$|E
25|$|In addition, <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>has</b> {{experimented with}} new assault ration prototypes, {{such as the}} First Strike Ration and the HOOAH!

Production began in 1986 and four years later the rifle was officially accepted into service in 1990, hence the military designation Stgw 90. Over 600,000 rifles have been delivered since then and production for <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>has</b> now ceased.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian Forces have derived many {{of their}} traditions and symbols from the British army, navy, and air force, {{including}} those with royal elements. Contemporary icons and rituals, however, have evolved to include elements reflective of Canada and the Canadian monarchy. Members of the country's Royal Family also continue their two century old practice of maintaining personal relationships with the Canadian Forces {{as well as individual}} units, around which <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>has</b> developed complex protocols.|$|E
25|$|Eglin Air Force Base and MacDill Air Force Base (now {{the home}} of U.S. Central Command) were also {{developed}} during this time. During the Cold War, Florida's coastal access and proximity to Cuba encouraged {{the development of these}} and other military facilities.

5000|$|The {{questions}} were raised over the Operation Sirat-e-Mustaqeem. The Pakistani media had {{speculated that the}} aim of the operation was not Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan. <b>The</b> <b>military</b> <b>had</b> effectively avoided targeting the Taliban. The main target of the operation was Lashkar-e-Islam, whose elements were involved in kidnapping of Christian families based in Peshawar. The Pakistani media also reported that LeI's militants avoided to fight with <b>the</b> <b>military</b> and they <b>had</b> taken refuge among the general population. The Jang News also reported that <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>had</b> targeted nothing more than [...] "empty buildings by the banned organizations Lashkar-e-Islam, Ansarul Islam and Amr bil Maroof wa Nahi al-Munkar," [...] and that [...] "not one of the leaders or fighters these organizations was captured.|$|R

25|$|The runway, main taxiway and {{all areas}} {{to the north}} of the civil {{aviation}} area are owned by the military. Flesland Air Station no longer has stationed aircraft, but there is activity in several of the military installations. Flesland is occasionally used during exercises. <b>The</b> <b>military</b> <b>has</b> indicated that it may chose to sell its estate at the airport in the future. Avinor and the military have initiated a process that may result in the runway and taxiway being transferred to Avinor ownership.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 1970s, the {{military}} abandoned regular traffic on the line. The southern track was pulled up by enthusiasts from the Urskog–Høland Line, which used the track for their heritage railway. The middle track was lifted to make room for a firing range. However, <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>has</b> retained maintenance of the line so that it at any time is in operational condition, as it had high strategic importance should war break out. During the construction of the European Route E6, it was decided that a new bridge be built over the line, financed by {{the military}} budget.|$|E
25|$|One unique view, {{which does}} not neatly fall into either of the cultural- or connectivity-gap categories, centers on the {{organizational}} differences {{between the military and}} civilian societies. This view claims to explain much as to why <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>has</b> been or may be used to press ahead of society's norms. This view goes beyond the simpler cultural-gap approach and emphasizes the ability of the military society to control the behavior and attitudes of its members in ways not possible in the more open civilian society, as evidenced by such phenomena as desegregation of the military and inclusion of women in the military.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a further}} {{development}} {{reported by the}} Fiji Times on 23 December, Commander Esala Teleni said that <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>had</b> already signed Leung's contract. This, he said, was the prerogative of <b>the</b> <b>military,</b> not <b>the</b> ministry. He also claimed that Leung had been chosen as Judge Advocate {{at the request of}} President Iloilo. [...] "If Home Affairs does not want him, it would go against the President's wish," [...] Commander Teleni said.

25|$|The Bangladesh Armed Forces have {{inherited}} the institutional {{framework of the}} British military and the British Indian Army. It was formed in 1971 from the military regiments of East Pakistan. In 2012 the army strength was around 300,000, including reservists, the Air Force (22,000) and the Navy (24,000). In addition to traditional defence roles, <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>has</b> supported civil authorities in disaster relief and provided internal security during periods of political unrest. For many years, Bangladesh has been the world's largest contributor to UN peacekeeping forces. In February 2015, the country made major deployments to Côte d'Ivoire, Cyprus, Darfur, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Golan Heights, Haiti, Lebanon, Liberia and South Sudan.|$|E
25|$|The Pakistan Armed Forces are the best-organized {{institution}} in Pakistan, and are highly respected in civil society. Since {{the founding of}} Pakistan, <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>has</b> {{played a key role}} in holding the state together, promoting a feeling of nationhood and providing a bastion of selfless service. In addition, the Pakistan Armed Forces are the largest contributors to United Nations peacekeeping efforts, with more than 10,000 personnel deployed overseas in 2007. Other foreign deployments have consisted of Pakistani military personnel serving as military advisers in African and Arab countries. The Pakistani military has maintained combat divisions and brigade-strength presences in some of the Arab countries during the Arab–Israeli Wars, aided the Coalition forces in the first Gulf War, and took part in the Somalian and Bosnian conflicts.|$|E
25|$|Greek {{military}} personnel total 367,450, of whom 142,950 are active and 220,500 are reserve. Greece ranks 15th {{in the world}} in the number of citizens serving in the armed forces, due largely to compulsory military service for males between the ages of 19 and 45 (females are exempted from conscription but may otherwise serve in the military). Mandatory military service is one year for the Army and nine months for the Navy and Air Force. Additionally, Greek males between the ages of 18 and 60 who live in strategically sensitive areas may be required to serve part-time in the National Guard. However, as <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>has</b> sought to become a completely professional force, the government has promised to reduce mandatory military service or abolish it completely.|$|E
