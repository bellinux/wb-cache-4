However, insect pests cause major damage to the principal legume crops In developing countries (cowpea, soybean, beans, pigeonpea and groundnut) and chemical control is expensive and increasingly unacceptable on environmental grounds. Insect pests of <b>tropical</b> <b>food</b> legumes, edited by S R Singh, who is Director of the Grain Legume Improvement Program at IITA in Nigeria, focuses on the development of crops that are resistant to infestation by insects and explores methods which can minimize the need for chemical control. By these means, while insect attack may never totally be conquered, damage can be limited and yields stabilized. The information in this book has been arranged by crop description so that the campaigners in the crusade against insect damage can concentrate easily on the insects that affect production and growth.

50|$|Replacement crops {{can also}} make nations agriculturally independent. Sugar, for example, comes from sugar cane {{imported}} from Polynesia. Instead of buying the sugar from Polynesia, a nation can make sugar from sugar beets, maple sap, or sweetener from stevia plant, keeping the profits circulating within the nation's economy. Paper and clothes can be made of hemp instead of trees and cotton. <b>Tropical</b> <b>foods</b> won't grow in many places in Europe, but they will grow in insulated greenhouses or tents in Europe. Soybean plant cellulose can replace plastic (made from oil). Ethanol from farm waste or hempseed oil can replace gasoline. Rainforest medicine plants grown locally can replace many imported medicines. Alternates of cash crops, like sugar and oil replacements, can reduce farmers' dependency on subsidies in both developed and developing nations.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the light}} of near future {{compulsory}} LCA based eco-labelling in France, the LCA literature on major <b>tropical</b> <b>food</b> imports was reviewed. About 70 studies covering five food product categories were considered. Observations were similar across these categories of fruits and vegetables, rice, stimulant beverages, vegetable oils and animal products: most assessments are either partial (often one or two impact categories), or lack a comprehensive description of the methodology and data used. In addition to this scarcity of comprehensive LCA studies, methodological weaknesses are generally observed, especially regarding the failure to consider farming systems diversity, the lack of specific methods and data for their inventory (especially field emissions), the absence of crucial environmental indicators for tropical systems such as biodiversity and water use.

Therefore, it is important to find an economically viable use for this waste (e. g., as a food additive or supplement with high nutraceutical value). We investigated the anti-obesity effects of mango seed kernel extract with hot water (MSKE-W) in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes and in a high fat diet (HFD) -induced obesity rat model. MSKE-W caused a significant decrease in the activity of glycerol 2 -phosphate dehydrogenase in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes without eliciting cell cytotoxicity and inhibited cellular lipid accumulation through down-regulation of transcription factors such as PPAR γ and C/EBP α. In the animal model, rats fed an HFD containing 1 % MSKE-W gained less weight than rats fed an HFD alone. The visceral fat mass in rats fed an HFD containing 1 % MSKE-W tended to be lower than that in rats fed an HFD alone. Furthermore, histological examination of rat livers from an HFD showed steatohepatitis. However, rats on an HFD containning 1 % MSKE-W showed no histopathological changes in liver tissue. Our results indicate that MSKE-W influences anti-obesity effects, both in vitro and in vivo, and suggest that MSKE-W provides a novel preventive potential against obesity. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Cornel Net Carbohydrate and Protein System model version 5. 0 was {{assessed}} as for its prediction of dry matter intake and milk production of grazing lactating Holstein × Zebu cows. Eight lactating cows grazing elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum, Schum., cv. Napier) {{were used in}} two experiments of 30 days each. The experimental design was of randomized blocks (subplots). Dry matter intake was estimated using the chromium oxide and in vitro dry matter digestibility techniques. The estimated dry matter intake was compared with the values predicted by the model. Extrusa samples of the elephant grass pasture were obtained from a cow with esophageal fistula during nine days in each experimental period. Carbohydrate and nitrogenous fractions were analyzed and the degradation rate of carbohydrate was estimated by the gas production technique. The inputs referring to the animals (body weight, age, milk production, milk composition and breed type), to the environment (temperature, relative humidity of air and management condition) and to feeds chemical composition in each experimental period were inserted in the model. The model was accurate on the prediction of dry matter intake, considering that the mean values obtained by the chromium oxide technique and predicted by model (2. 45 and 2. 46 % of body weight, respectively) {{did not differ significantly}} from each other. However, the model underestimated the observed milk production in 62. 4 %, where the metabolizable energy was the first limiting.

40|$|South Asian {{countryside}} {{is potentially}} an attractive {{space on the}} globe though in actuality it is as yet comparatively much less globalised an arena. It has not only a potential vast capacity to supply the valued platter of <b>tropical</b> <b>foods</b> to the world but also a rapidly increasing actual capacity {{to be a huge}} reservoir market for commodity and capital of the world. Global capitalism is thus restless to penetrate this arena of South Asia; it has been conducive in bringing here a number of international institutionalised organisations to establish its sway. Combined with the already flourishing domestic organisation movements which have been resisting all that harms agriculture and the ‘rural’, the entry of such organisations which are fabulously magnified and huge in size is but a clear danger to the old regimes of the respective nation-states. Faced with the prospect of increasingly shrunken role in the economic sectors of manufacturing and services, the domestic state actors has a stake in maintenance of its presence in the ‘rural’ because agriculture here has not been displaced by either the industrialisation set {{in the early twentieth century}} or the agribusiness system dominating in the late twentieth century. They find here and here only a hassle-free terrain on a platter. The danger to the regimes of domestic states which has been created through sustained efforts by activities connected with the domestic organisation movements is magnified with such entry of external entities working at the behest of global capitalism. A tripartite conflict of interests has been unfolding for some time. As principal adversaries, not only the agricultural populace together with their newly-discovered supporters amidst the middle-class intelligentsia and media but also the alien arbitrators of the international inter-governmental mega-institutions and private multinational corporations is at the loggerhead with the native functionaries of respective nation-state. Can the individual nation-state hold its autonomous presence in the south Asian countryside? The answer is difficult. In this regime of globalisation of capital, production and consumption of food under the aegis of globalised agribusiness firms and corporation, the dispute is certainly and transparently on the issues of principles and practices of sharing the fruits of economic advancement in south Asia. If at all the nation-states have to maintain their ‘agrarian welfare state’ image in the countryside, it is only the act of delivery of justice for the ‘rural’ that would be crucial in maintaining the legitimacy and acceptance of the states in south Asia. In such a situation as it obtains today, it is clear that the agenda of agrarian justice has already emerged as paramount in importance today than ever before. The domestic as well as international nongovernmental organisation movements are geared to this volitional agenda only. ...|$|E
40|$|Small {{farms in}} Africa produce more than 80 % of staple food {{requirement}} for both {{urban and rural}} areas, and 50 - 60 % of the materials needed for industry. However, an over-reliance on large-scale food-processing units, bought from industrialized countries, {{means that there is}} a continuing need for substantial imports of parts, for raw materials and for maintenance services. Because most farms in Africa are small-scale, they rarely run at full capacity. Although developing countries are striving to increase their food production, much food is wasted before it can be eaten because processing and preservation are carried out in the place of production. A new book, Processing and preservation of <b>tropical</b> and subtropical <b>foods</b> by J. Maud Kordylas, provides information on <b>tropical</b> <b>food</b> crops, their proper harvesting, handling, storing, processing and preservation. Mrs Kordylas emphasizes traditional processes and their importance and relevance {{to the development of the}} food sector, and how they might be improved. Domestic skills are given as the basis from which food producers can move to industrial food processing. The contents of the book are organized to give a systematic and formal approach to each crop group. While the traditional processes of handling are fully documented, a scientific modern basis for the practice is also given.

Until recently in the western world, eating insects was considered a peculiar <b>tropical</b> <b>food</b> habit and the term 'entomophagy' was coined.

Or is this, considering our appetite for meat, an inconvenient truth? Is stressing environmental sustainability enough to raise consumers' interest to consume insects?
