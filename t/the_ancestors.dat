5|$|The {{male who}} {{performs}} the shraddha {{should take a}} purifying bath beforehand {{and is expected to}} wear a dhoti. He wears a ring of kush grass. Then <b>the</b> <b>ancestors</b> are invoked to reside in the ring. The shraddha is usually performed bare-chested, as the position of the sacred thread worn by him needs to be changed multiple times during the ceremony. The shraddha involves pinda-daan, which is an offering to <b>the</b> <b>ancestors</b> of pindas (cooked rice and barley flour balls mixed with ghee and black sesame seeds), accompanying the release of water from the hand. It is followed by the worship of Vishnu in form of the darbha grass, a gold image or Shaligram stone and Yama. The food offering is then made, cooked especially for the ceremony on the roof. The offering is considered to be accepted if a crow arrives and devours the food; the bird is believed to be a messenger from Yama or the spirit of <b>the</b> <b>ancestors.</b> A cow and a dog are also fed, and Brahmin priests are also offered food. Once <b>the</b> <b>ancestors</b> (crow) and Brahmins have eaten, the family members can begin lunch.|$|E

5|$|The {{traditional}} {{beliefs of}} the Sihanaka, as elsewhere in Madagascar, revolve around respect for a creator god (Zanahary), <b>the</b> <b>ancestors,</b> and fady (ancestral interdictions). Aspects of ancestor worship among the Sihanaka include joro (collective prayers said to invoke the blessings of God or <b>the</b> <b>ancestors),</b> burial in family tombs, the famadihana reburial ceremony, and the sanctification of particular stones (tsangambato), land (tany masina), and shrines (doany, tony and jiro). Another major element of this tradition {{is the role of}} ambalavelona, believed to be the spirits of <b>the</b> <b>ancestors</b> themselves. Each ancestral practice or tradition has a particular spirit associated with it, and the Sihanaka show respect for these spirits by maintaining ancestral customs and traditions and adhering to fady.|$|E

25|$|Until recently, Pliohippus was {{believed}} to be <b>the</b> <b>ancestor</b> of present-day horses because of its many anatomical similarities.

5|$|The 2002 study {{indicated}} that <b>the</b> <b>ancestors</b> of the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo diverged around the Paleogene-Neogene boundary. The Mascarene Islands (Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues), are of volcanic origin and are less than 10 million years old. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>ancestors</b> of both birds probably remained capable of flight for a considerable time after the separation of their lineage. The Nicobar and spotted green pigeon were placed {{at the base of}} a lineage leading to the Raphinae, which indicates the flightless raphines had ancestors that were able to fly, were semi-terrestrial, and inhabited islands. This in turn supports the hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>ancestors</b> of those birds reached the Mascarene islands by island hopping from South Asia. The lack of mammalian herbivores competing for resources on these islands allowed the solitaire and the dodo to attain very large sizes. The dodo lost the ability to fly owing to the lack of mammalian predators on Mauritius. Another large, flightless pigeon, the Viti Levu giant pigeon (Natunaornis gigoura), was described in 2001 from subfossil material from Fiji. It was only slightly smaller than the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo, and it too is thought to have been related to the crowned pigeons.|$|E

5|$|Turner {{and colleagues}} {{interpreted}} {{the presence of}} feathers on Velociraptor as evidence against {{the idea that the}} larger, flightless maniraptorans lost their feathers secondarily due to larger body size.

5|$|Wade {{asserts that}} there is a clear {{continuity}} from the earlier apes of five million years ago to the anatomically modern humans who diverged from them, citing the genetic and social similarities between humans and chimpanzees.

5|$|While the dinosaur-bird {{connection}} (or lack thereof) {{was being}} pursued in paleontology, {{the problem of}} the evolution of flight was under scrutiny as well. It was observed that a number of animals with moderate flying or gliding ability, such as bats, flying lizards and flying squirrels have arboreal lifestyles. This led to the idea that <b>the</b> <b>ancestors</b> of birds must have gradually acquired the ability to fly from leaping among branches in the tops of trees. The Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa proposed an alternate hypothesis in 1907, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>ancestors</b> of birds were fast-running, bipedal animals related to theropod dinosaurs. When Heilmann came onto the paleontology scene, these two sets of conflicting theories provided the framework for his research and eventual conclusions.|$|E
