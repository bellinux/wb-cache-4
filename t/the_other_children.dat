5|$|In 1842 England, a {{young boy}} builds a snowman, but refuses to play with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>children.</b> The snowman starts {{speaking}} to the boy, repeating his assertions that <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>children</b> are silly. Fifty years later, the boy has grown up to be Dr. Walter Simeon, proprietor of the Great Intelligence Institute. He hires men to collect samples of snow, which he places in a large snow-filled globe in his laboratory before feeding the men {{to a group of}} animated snowmen. The Doctor, still despondent after losing his former companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams, has parked his TARDIS above Victorian London among the clouds. He uses his allies Vastra, Jenny, and Strax to keep people away from him. They also fill their time investigating mysteries throughout the city.|$|E

However, during kindergarten, Danner nearly kills the school's bully in a one-sided fight after being assaulted by the child.

5|$|In 1429, when Isabeau {{lived in}} English-occupied Paris, the {{accusation}} was again put forth that CharlesVII {{was not the}} son of CharlesVI.

Furthermore, gossip spread that Joan of Arc was Isabeau and Orleans' illegitimate daughter—a rumor Gibbons finds improbable because Joan of Arc almost certainly was not born for some years after Orléans' assassination. Stories circulated that the dauphins were murdered, and attempts were made to poison <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>children,</b> all of which added to Isabeau's reputation of one of history's great villains.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} {{has also made}} several parodic cameo and homage appearances in non-Disney media. In the 1945 radio program This Is My Best, the Queen uttered a curse so dreadful that the Magic Mirror shattered into a thousand pieces and where the Queen once stood {{was nothing but a}} heap of ashes from which black spiders crawled and scuffled off into the night. In Woody Allen's live-action film Annie Hall (1977), Alvy mentions that when he saw Disney's Snow White, he was attracted to the Queen while all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>children</b> had a crush on Snow White. This is followed by an animated sequence of the Wicked Queen, resembling Annie and voiced by Diane Keaton, talking to the cartoon version of the daydreaming Alvy, but turns out that even the Queen scolds him; Alvy attributes it to her having her period mood, to which the Queen reminds him she is just a cartoon character.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} years that Alder lived with the Indians he was very ill, a {{condition}} Alder attributed to the Indians' diet. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>children</b> in the village were friendly towards Alder, and worked together to teach him their language, customs, and traditions. In time, Alder fully adopted the Mingo way of life; he lived, hunted, and fought as an Indian. When {{he was old enough}} he was given an English musket, which he used to hunt mud turtles, wild turkeys, and raccoons. He was praised in the village for his hunting skills. He grew attached to his new life and when, in 1783, a trader from Kentucky offered to exchange him for a Shawnee prisoner, Alder refused. Alder was living in the Indian village of Mack-a-chack when it was destroyed by Benjamin Logan during his raid into Ohio Country in 1786, and he accompanied the Indians on raids into Kentucky to steal horses from white settlers.|$|E
25|$|Say we {{are told}} that a woman has two children. If we ask whether either of them is a girl, and are told yes, what is the {{probability}} that <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>child</b> is also a girl? Considering this new child independently, one might expect the probability that <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>child</b> is female is ½ (50%). But by building a probability space (illustrating all possible outcomes), we see that the probability is actually only ⅓ (33%). This is because the possibility space illustrates 4 ways of having these two children: boy-boy, girl-boy, boy-girl, and girl-girl. But we were given more information. Once {{we are told}} that one of the children is a female, we use this new information to eliminate the boy-boy scenario. Thus the probability space reveals that there are still 3 ways to have two children where one is a female: boy-girl, girl-boy, girl-girl. Only ⅓ of these scenarios would have <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>child</b> also be a girl. Using a probability space, we are less likely to miss one of the possible scenarios, or to neglect the importance of new information. For further information, see Boy or girl paradox.|$|R

She develops a close friendship with 5-Nova Luis. At the age of seven Hsing and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>children</b> of similar age are allowed to put on clothes for the first time; Hsing greatly looks forward to this ceremony, a rite of passage aboard the Discovery. As the children grow older Luis begins to develop an interest in the virtual reality programs that allow people on the ship to explore the planet they have left behind. Disagreements with her friend Rosie, a member of Bliss, lead Hsing to explore the philosophy of the angels. Although she questions in her own mind the purpose of the voyage, she disagrees with the angels' thinking, which eventually damages her friendship with Rosie. Luis also investigates this group, by participating in some of their practices.|$|E

After retrieving the ingredients, Ma Soupswill creates a potion to reverse the effects on Amber. However, she unwittingly transforms Amber into an even more hideous monster, having added the wrong spice, and Amber attacks Cooper in anger. Cooper defeats the mutated Amber and Ma Soupswill arrives with the correct spice, finally transforming Amber back to herself. Afterward, Cooper and Amber attempt to escape the mansion but are stopped by Mr. Ribs (Ma Soupswill's assistant). He tells them to help free <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>children</b> who are imprisoned all over the mansion. Cooper seeks Crivens {{for help and}} tells him that only the Baron has the key to free them. To get to his room, Cooper must collect three pieces of a rhyme which {{opens the door to}} the Baron's room. Once there, a battle ensues, and Cooper emerges victorious.|$|E
5|$|Eberhardt {{was well}} educated; along with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>children</b> in the family, she was home-schooled by Trophimowsky. She was fluent in French, spoke Russian, German and Italian, and was taught Latin, Greek, and {{classical}} Arabic. She studied philosophy, metaphysics, chemistry, history, and geography, {{though she was}} most passionate about literature, reading the works of authors including Pierre Loti, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Leo Tolstoy, Voltaire and Émile Zola while she was a teenager, and was also an admirer of the poets Semyon Nadson and Charles Baudelaire. At an early age she began wearing male clothing, enjoying its freedom, and her nonconformist father did not discourage her. The children of deMoerder resented their stepfather, who forbade them from obtaining professions or leaving the home, and effectively used them as slaves to tend to his extensive gardens. Eberhardt's sister Nathalie married against Trophimowsky's wishes in 1888, and was subsequently {{cut off from the}} rest of the household. Nathalie's departure had a profound effect on Eberhart's childhood, as she had been responsible for most of the home duties; the household subsequently suffered from a lack of hygiene and regular meals.|$|E
