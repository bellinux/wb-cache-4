5|$|It is {{a long-standing}} practice, {{as with many}} Jesuit schools around the world, that pupils write A.M.D.G. in the top left hand corner of any piece of work <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> <b>It</b> stands for the Latin phrase Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam which means For the Greater Glory of God. At {{the end of a}} piece of work they write L.D.S. in the centre of the page. It stands for Laus Deo Semper which means Praise to God Always. These are both {{traditional}} Jesuit mottoes.|$|E

25|$|Mafiosi rarely {{directly}} involve {{themselves in}} smuggling operations. When <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>it</b> is usually when the operations are especially risky. In this case, they may induct smugglers into their clans {{in the hope}} of binding them more firmly. This was the case with heroin smuggling, where the volumes and profits involved were too large to keep the operations at arm's length.|$|E

25|$|Another {{option is}} {{self-help}} based on principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Using {{a book or}} a website, a person does the kinds of exercises {{that would be used}} in therapy, but <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> on their own, perhaps with some email or phone support from a therapist. A systematic analysis of trials testing this kind of self-help found that websites, books, and other materials based on cognitive-behavioral therapy could help some people. The best-studied conditions are panic disorder and social phobia.|$|E

25|$|He made {{it clear}} that the Church's aim was not merely to help the {{faithful}} make due satisfaction for their sins, but chiefly to bring them to greater fervour of charity. For this purpose he decreed that partial indulgences, previously granted as the equivalent of a certain number of days, months, quarantines (forty-day periods) or years of canonical penance, simply supplement, and to the same degree, the remission that those performing the indulgenced action already gain by the charity and contrition with which <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gymnasiums {{have its}} courses (smerovi), {{and the most}} common ones are the Socio-Linguistics Course, Science-Mathematics Course, Information Technology Course, Bilingual Course, and the General Course. Students can only choose one course (<b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> when they write their wish list for {{preferred}} schools and courses) and they usually don't change it until they graduate. Every course has the same number and list of classes, but the difference is in their schedules (for example, the Socio-Linguistic Course might have English classes five times a week, while the Science-Mathematics Course offers two English classes a week).|$|E
25|$|The depth, {{texture and}} {{composition}} of soils can influence its water retaining and draining ability. Soils containing large amounts of organic material tend to have the highest water retention abilities. These types of soils include deep loams, silty soils like what is typically found on the fertile valley floors {{such as in the}} California's Napa Valley. Clay particles have the potential to remain in colloidal suspension {{for long periods of time}} when it is dissolved in water. This gives clay-based soils the potential to retain significant amount of water such as the clay soils of the Right bank Bordeaux region of Pomerol. Many regions with these types of water retaining soils have little need for irrigation, or if <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> is usually supplemental during periods of drought. Soils with poor water retention include sand and alluvial gravel based soils such as those found in the Barolo and Barbaresco zones of Italy or in many areas of South Australia. Depending on the climate and amount of natural rainfall, areas with poor water retention may need irrigation.|$|E

25|$|Roberts and Davies held an {{unofficial}} contest {{to see how}} many references to Christie's works could be inserted. Titles that were noted were: The Murder of Roger Ackroyd; Why Didn't They Ask Evans; The Body in the Library; The Secret Adversary; N or M?; Nemesis; Cat Among the Pigeons; Dead Man's Folly; <b>They</b> <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> With Mirrors; Appointment with Death; Cards on the Table; Sparkling Cyanide; Endless Night; Crooked House; Death in the Clouds; The Moving Finger; Taken at the Flood; Death Comes as the End; Murder on the Orient Express and The Murder at the Vicarage. A deleted scene referred to The Man in the Brown Suit, referring to the Doctor's clothing. The narrative itself parallels several of Christie's novels: the jewel theft storyline parallels The Secret of Chimneys; Miss Chandrakala's death was influenced by And Then There Were None; and the Colonel's revelation that he was not disabled paralleled a key concept of The Pale Horse. In an email conversation with journalist Benjamin Cook, Davies admitted he had initially added a reference to the original title of And Then There Were None, Ten Little Niggers, but decided it was too risky.|$|E

After gaining enough points, the character levels up. The current maximum level is 220. At each new level, the character is given some [...] "skill points", which are used to increase any combination of the eighty-three skills that they choose.|$|E

500|$|Historian Daniel Silliman {{has argued}} that, {{whatever}} the thieves' intention, the act puts {{the culture of}} Christmas in a different light. [...] "Baby Jesus thieves literally take the Christ out of Christmas," [...] Silliman writes. [...] "When <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>it</b> becomes apparent that the sacred object is also a piece of property, protected by the law that protects property and this whole apparatus that defends Christmas: fences and lights, tracking devices and private security companies, patrolling police and the courts. The commercialization of Christmas is visible here {{in a way it}} might not be, otherwise. That’s the power of the joke." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Basingstoke" [...] is a {{code word}} in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera Ruddigore, [...] used by the [...] "bad baronet" [...] after he reforms, to remind his bride [...] "Mad Margaret" [...] of their plan to live lives of boring respectability. In 1895, Thomas Hardy {{referred}} to Basingstoke as [...] "Stoke Barehills" [...] in Jude the Obscure. The town is also mentioned in Agatha Christie's <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with Mirrors and is widely {{thought to be the}} location of Market Basing in the Miss Marple stories. Patrick Wilde's 1993 play, What's Wrong with Angry? is set in Basingstoke. It was later adapted into the 1998 film, Get Real, which was filmed at various locations around Basingstoke.|$|E

And when they do ask for budget cuts, <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> [...] "where it does not affect their national interests." [...] He labels this [...] "a double standard which is applied or is thought to be applied in the Secretariat, and we as overseers of the G-77 do not accept this double standard." ...|$|E
