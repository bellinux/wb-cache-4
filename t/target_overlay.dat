40|$|Abstract — Contributions {{from the}} {{information}} fusion community have enabled comprehensible traces of intrusion alerts occurring on computer networks. Traced or tracked cyber attacks are the bases for threat projection in this work. Due to its complexity, we separate threat projection into two subtasks: predicting likely next targets and predicting attacker behavior. A virtual cyber terrain is proposed for identifying likely <b>targets.</b> <b>Overlaying</b> traced alerts onto the cyber terrain reveals exposed vulnerabilities, services, and hosts. Meanwhile, a novel attempt to extract cyber attack behavior is discussed. Leveraging traditional work on prediction and compression, this work identifies behavior patterns from traced cyber attack data. The extracted behavior patterns are expected to further refine projections deduced from the cyber terrain...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Many {{multicast}} overlay networks maintain application-specific {{performance goals}} such as bandwidth, latency, jitter and loss rate by dynamically changing the overlay structure using measurement-based adaptation mechanisms. This {{results in an}} unstructured overlay where no neighbor selection constraints are imposed. Although such networks provide resilience to benign failures, they are susceptible to attacks conducted by adversaries that compromise overlay nodes. Previous defense solutions proposed to address attacks against overlay networks rely on strong organizational constraints and are not effective for unstructured overlays. In this work, we identify, demonstrate and mitigate insider attacks against measurement-based adaptation mechanisms in unstructured multicast overlay networks. The attacks <b>target</b> the <b>overlay</b> network construction, maintenance, and availability and allow malicious nodes to control significant traffic in the network, facilitating selective forwarding, traffic analysis, and overlay partitioning. We propose techniques to decrease the number of incorrect or unnecessary adaptations by using outlier detection.

However, rich interaction with these devices can become challenging if they need be controlled from a distance, or are too small to accommodate user interfaces on their own. In this work, we explore PICOntrol, a new approach using an off-the-shelf handheld pico projector for direct control of physical devices through visible light. The projected image serves a dual purpose by simultaneously presenting a visible interface to the user, and transmitting embedded control information to inexpensive sensor units integrated with the devices. To use PICOntrol, the user points the handheld projector at a <b>target</b> device, <b>overlays</b> a projected user interface on its sensor unit, and performs various GUI-style or gestural interactions. PICOntrol enables direct, visible, and rich interactions with various physical devices without requiring central infrastructure.

40|$|Abstract — Adaptive measurement-based overlay {{networks}} of-fer increased {{performance and}} resilience to benign failures for end-to-end communication by using aggressive adaptivity mech-anisms. These mechanisms dynamically optimize application-centric metrics such as latency, jitter, bandwidth, and loss rate. However, end-systems {{are more vulnerable}} than core routers, making overlay networks susceptible to malicious attacks coming from untrusted outsiders, and especially from trusted (but compromised) members of the overlay. Unlike outsider attacks, insider (or Byzantine) attacks can not be prevented by sim-ply deploying cryptographic authentication mechanisms. In this work, we identify and classify insider attacks against adaptivity mechanisms in overlay networks and demonstrate several of them against the ESM/Narada multicast overlay system. The attacks <b>target</b> the <b>overlay</b> network construction, maintenance, and availability and allow malicious nodes to control significant traffic in the network, facilitating further attacks such as selective forwarding and traffic analysis. We believe this work {{is the first to}} classify insider attacks against adaptivity mechanisms in distributed systems and the first to propose techniques to enhance the adaptivity mechanisms with Byzantine-resilience.

To this end, sequentially presented <b>target</b> words, <b>overlayed</b> onto negative or neutral pictures, were studied in separate blocks (within-subjects) using a deep or shallow encoding instruction (between-subjects). Following study, in Test 1, participants completed separate recognition test blocks {{for the words}} overlayed onto the negative and the neutral contexts. Following this, in Test 2, participants completed a recognition test for the foils from each Test 1 block. We found a significant three-way interaction on Test 2, such that individuals with high anxiety who initially studied target words using a shallow encoding instruction, demonstrated significantly elevated memory for foils that were contained within the negative Test 1 block. Results show that during retrieval (Test 1), participants re-entered the mode of processing (negative or neutral) engaged at encoding, tainting the encoding of foils with that same mode of processing. The findings suggest that individuals with high relative to low anxiety, adopt a particularly salient negative retrieval mode, and this creates a downstream bias in encoding and subsequent retrieval of otherwise neutral information...|$|R
40|$|Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), {{a member}} of the Birnaviridae family, is a major avian {{pathogen}} responsible for an immunosuppressive disease affecting juvenile chickens. The IBDV genome is formed by two dsRNA segments. The largest one harbors two partially overlapping open reading frames encoding a non-structural polypeptide, known as VP 5, and a large polyprotein, respectively. VP 5 is non-essential for virus replication. However, it {{plays a major role in}} IBDV pathogenesis. VP 5 accumulates at the plasma membrane (PM) of IBDV-infected cells. We have analyzed the mechanism underlying the VP 5 PM targeting. Updated topological prediction algorithm servers fail to identify a transmembrane domain within the VP 5 sequence. However, the VP 5 polycationic C-terminal region, harboring three closely spaced patches formed by two or three consecutive basic amino acid residues (ly-sine or arginine), might account for its PM tropism.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} Overlay network designs have been proposed to provide a large range of services ranging from content delivery and application-level multicast to robust data delivery {{in the presence of}} underlying network path outages and periods of degraded network performance. Previous work has shown that overlay networks can be very effective in protecting against faults that are due to the underlying network conditions. Our goal is to extend the existing model of protecting against network faults where faults are due to malicious attacks that specifically <b>target</b> the <b>overlay</b> network. We further assume that the adversaries can generate any fault pattern and have full knowledge of the overlay network including the routing algorithm used. We present in this paper a novel routing algorithm that is provably competitive against the best offline routing strategy. Our algorithm works by measuring the reliability of the overlay links and then probabilistically routing packets along multiple paths using the computed reliability metrics. We have simulated the algorithm and our experimental results show that our solution performs as well as existing overlay routing algorithms in the case of non-malicious errors but offers orders of magnitude improvement over existing algorithms in the case of malicious attacks. ...|$|R
40|$|Wide-ranging, surface-feeding pelagic seabirds are {{the most}} {{numerous}} functional group of birds in the Southern Ocean. The mesoscale habitat use of these birds is increasingly being quantified by relating their movements to remotely sensed, near surface properties of the ocean. However, prey availability at the sea surface may also be determined by habitat characteristics not measurable from space. For instance, benthic-pelagic coupling, which occurs when seabed processes affect productivity in the epipelagic zone, can link benthic habitat type to availability of surface prey. We combined acoustically derived maps of the substrate of the South Georgia shelf with GPS tracking to quantify the sub-mesoscale habitat use of breeding black-browed albatrosses. We show that albatrosses preferentially used waters overlaying glacial moraine banks near the shelf edge {{and that this was}} unrelated to the presence of trawlers targeting mackerel icefish, which are also associated with these features. Stomach temperature profiles suggest that albatrosses primarily caught krill and fish over the banks. We hypothesize that black-browed albatrosses <b>target</b> waters <b>overlaying</b> moraine banks due to upward benthic-pelagic coupling, mediated by an increase in abundance of zooplankton such as Antarctic krill. Our findings suggest that the potential effects of such processes on pelagic seabird distribution warrant wider investigation...|$|R

The depth cameras are able to capture 3 -D data of a surface in real-time, and have several advantages compared with methods using only standard color cameras. However, {{it is not easy}} to register a 3 -D deformable mesh to a point cloud of the non-rigid surface while keeping its geometrical topology. In order to solve this problem, our method starts by learning many representative meshes to generate surface deformation models. Then, while capturing 3 -D data, we register a feasible 3 -D mesh to the <b>target</b> surface and <b>overlay</b> a template texture onto the registered mesh. Even if the depth data are noisy or sparse, the learning-based method provides us with a smooth surface mesh. In addition, our method can be applied to real-time applications.

40|$|Ran/TC 4 is an essential, nuclear GTPase {{implicated in}} the {{initiation}} of DNA replication, entry into and exit from mitosis, and in nuclear RNA and protein transport through the nuclear pore complex. This diversity of functions suggests that Ran interacts {{with a large number}} of down-stream <b>targets.</b> Using an <b>overlay</b> assay, we detected a family of putative target proteins that associate with GTP-bound Ran. The sequence of only one such protein, HTF 9 a/RanBP 1, is known. We have now cloned two additional Ran-binding proteins, allowing identification of a distinctive, highly conserved sequence motif of approximately 150 residues. This motif represents a minimal Ran-binding domain that stabilizes the GTP-bound state of Ran. The isolated domain also functions as a coactivator of Ran-GTPase-activating protein. Mutation of a conserved residue within the Ran-binding domain of HTF 9 a protein drastically reduced Ran binding. Ran-binding proteins coimmunoprecipitated with epitope-tagged Ran from cell lysates, suggesting that these proteins may associate in vivo.

To further understand the biological significance of CaM isoforms, we examined whether CaM isoforms act on specific regulatory <b>targets.</b> In gel <b>overlay</b> assays on various soybean tissue extracts, surprisingly, two soybean CaM isoforms (SCaM- 1 and SCaM- 4) did not show significant differences in their target binding protein profiles, although they exhibited minor differences in their relative target binding affinities. In addition, both SCaM isoforms not only effectively bound five known plant CaMBPs, but also showed competitive binding to these proteins. Finally, immunolocalization experiments with the SCaM proteins in sections of various tissues using specific antibodies revealed similar distribution patterns for the SCaM isoforms except for root tissues, which indicates that the SCaM isoforms are concomitantly expressed in most plant tissues. These results suggest that CaM isoforms may compete for binding to CaMBPs in vivo. This competitive nature of CaM isoforms may allow modulation of Ca 2 +/CaM signaling pathways by virtue of relative abundance and differential target activation potency. close 393...|$|R

Here we present the experimental and numerical results indicating that this technique may also be competitive for the measurements of overlay error delta. A series of samples of superimposed gratings with well controlled overlay errors have been manufactured and measured with the angle resolved Mueller polarimeter. The <b>overlay</b> <b>targets</b> were 20 -mu m wide. When the overlay error is delta is equal to 0, absolute values of elements of real 4 x 4 Mueller matrix M are invariant by matrix transposition. Otherwise this symmetry breaks down. Consequently, we define the following overlay estimator matrix as E = |M| - |M|(t). The simulations show that matrix element E- 14 is the most sensitive to the overlay error. The scalar estimator of E- 14 was calculated by averaging the pixel values over a specifically chosen mask. This estimator is found to vary linearly with d for overlay values up to 50 nm. Our technique allows entering small overlay marks (down to 5 -mu m wide). Only one target measurement is needed for each overlay direction. The actual overlay value can be determined without detailed simulation of the structure provided two calibrated overlay structures are available for each direction...|$|R
40|$|International {{financial}} portfolios can {{be exposed}} to substantial risk from variations of the exchange rates between the countries in which they hold investments. Nonetheless, foreign exchange can both generate extra return as well as loss to a portfolio, hence rather than just being avoided, there are potential advantages to well-managed international portfolios. This paper introduces an optimisation model that manages currency exposure of a portfolio {{through a combination of}} foreign exchange forward contracts, thereby creating a “currency overlay” on top of asset allocation. Crucially, the hedging and transaction costs associated with holding forward contracts are taken into account in the portfolio risk and return calculations. This novel extension of previous overlay models improves the accuracy of the risk and return calculations of portfolios. Consequently, more accurate investment decisions are obtained through optimal asset allocation and hedging positions. Our experimental results show that inclusion of such costs significantly changes the optimal decisions. Furthermore, effects of constraints related to currency hedging are examined. It is shown that tighter constraints weaken the benefit of a currency overlay and that forward positions vary significantly across return targets. A larger currency overlay is advantageous at low and high return <b>targets,</b> whereas small <b>overlay</b> positions are observed at medium return targets. The resulting system can hence enhance intelligent expert decision support for financial managers...|$|R

40|$|Hemopoietic colony-forming cells {{committed}} to macrophage differentiation (M-CFC) are selectively and differentially inhibited by prostaglandin E (PGE). A hierarchy of sensitivity was observed among murine CFC stimulated by colony-stimulating factors (CSF) which {{differ in their}} ability to initiate proliferation of morphologically distinct colony types, or stimulated by CSF provided by macrophage feeder layers. Inhibition of macrophage colony formation to 50 percent levels occurred with PGE concentrations between 10 (- 8) and 10 (- 9) M, and was still evident at 10 (- 10) - 10 (- 11) M PGE concentrations. The growth of mixed colonies containing both macrophages and neutrophils was less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of PGE, however, the monocytoid component of these colonies was reduced in the presence of PGE. Neutrophil progenitor cell proliferation was not influenced by PGE concentrations below 10 (- 6) M, regardless of time of addition of PGE, whereas clonal macrophage expansion, as well as clone size, was sensitive to inhibition by PGE when added as late as 3 d after culture initiation. Prostaglandin F(2 α), was not inhibitory to colony formation. Experimental evidence for a selective role of macrophage PGE in the regulation of macrophage colony formation was directly provided by utilizing resident peritoneal macrophages as a source of CSF for bone marrow <b>target</b> cell <b>overlays.</b> Simultaneous morphological analysis of colonies proliferating in bilayer culture in response to increasing concentrations of macrophages, and direct measurements of PGE synthesized by an identical number of macrophages maintained in liquid culture demonstrate that a specific decline in macrophage colony formation occurs coincident with a linear increase in macrophage PGE synthesis. Inhibition of macrophage PGE synthesis by indomethacin results in the specific enhancement of macrophage colony formation. Furthermore, macrophage PGE synthesis is induced by CSF preparations with the selective capacity to differentially stimulate macrophage proliferation, but not by those which preferentially stimulate granulocyte colony formation. In comparison to the effects of PGE on M-CFC, polymorphonuclear granulocyte-derived lactoferrin (LF) reduces macrophage production of colony-stimulating activities for macrophage, mixed macrophage- neutrophil and neutrophil colony formation. The ability of LF to reduce macrophage PGE synthesis, presumably by decreasing CSF production, suggests that LF and PGE can interact in the control of macrophage and granulocyte proliferation...|$|R

We present a method that integrates soft-tissue information in X-ray fluoroscopy guided needle insertion, {{without the use of}} a stereotactic frame. Before the puncture is performed, the optimal needle paths are planned on a pre-operative CT dataset, see figure (a). At the beginning of the intervention a 3 D soft-tissue XperCT dataset is acquired with the C-arm X-ray system, and the pre-operative CT dataset is registered to the peri-operative XperCT, which also registers the CT and C-arm coordinate systems, see figure (b). The C-arm viewing incidence is steered to be tangent to the planned path: the entry view. Since this view is tangent to the needle trajectory, the path is foreshortened to a single point. When the needle is positioned at the entry position and its orientation is tangent to the fluoroscopy image, it can be inserted. The C-arm viewing incidence is then steered to be perpendicular to the planned path: the progression view, see figure (c). In this orientation, the needle can be navigated along the planned trajectory. The live fluoroscopy image is overlaid with the planned needle trajectory and fused with an oblique slice of the soft-tissue data, perpendicular to the viewing incidence and passing through the <b>target</b> point. The <b>overlay</b> image is real-time updated for any change in viewing incidence (L-arm, rotation, angulation), field of view, and source-image distance. The needle path is compensated for parallax distortion. Using the fused real-time image feedback, the needle can be steered by manually adjusting the insertion angle. The entry view and progression view steps are repeated for all planned puncture paths. The views can be selected at table side. Optionally, new paths can be planned during the intervention.

A number of different Pythonbased software packages have been developed, which are available to the larger scientific community. The approach in all these packages is to utilize preexisting Python modules {{as well as to}} be objectoriented and scalable. The first package that will be described and demonstrated is the Python Advanced Microwave Precipitation Radiometer (AMPR) Data Toolkit, or PyAMPR for short. PyAMPR reads geolocated brightness temperature data from any flight of the AMPR airborne instrument over its 25 year history into a common data structure suitable for userdefined analyses. It features rapid, simplified (i. e., one line of code) production of quicklook imagery, including Google Earth overlays, swath plots of individual channels, and strip charts showing multiple channels at once. These plotting routines are also capable of significant customization for detailed, publicationready figures. Deconvolution of the polarizationvarying channels to static horizontally and vertically polarized scenes is also available. Examples will be given of PyAMPR's contribution toward realtime AMPR data display during the Integrated Precipitation and Hydrology Experiment (IPHEx), which took place in the Carolinas during MayJune 2014. The second software package is the Marshall MultiRadar/MultiSensor (MRMS) Mosaic Python Toolkit, or MMMPy for short. MMMPy was designed to read, analyze, and display threedimensional national mosaicked reflectivity data produced by the NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL). MMMPy can read MRMS mosaics from either their unique binary format or their converted NetCDF format. It can also read and properly interpret the current mosaic design (4 regional tiles) as well as mosaics produced prior to late July 2013 (8 tiles). MMMPy can easily stitch multiple tiles together to provide a larger regional or national picture of precipitating weather systems. Composites, horizontal and vertical crosssections, and combinations thereof are easily displayed using as little as one line of code. MMMPy can also write to the native MRMS binary format, and subsectioning of tiles (or multiple stitched tiles) is anticipated to be in place by the time of this meeting. Thus, MMMPy also can be used to power the creation of custom mosaics for <b>targeted</b> regional studies. <b>Overlays</b> of other data (e. g., lightning observations) are easily accomplished. Demonstrations of MMMPy, including the creation of animations, will be shown. Finally, Marshall has done significant work to interface Pythonbased analysis routines with the U. S. Department of Energy's PyART software package for radar data ingest, processing, and analysis. One example of this is the Python Turbulence Detection Algorithm (PyTDA), an MSFCbased implementation of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Turbulence Detection Algorithm (NTDA) for the purposes of convectivescale analysis, situational awareness, and forensic meteorology. PyTDA exploits PyART's radar data ingest routines and data model to rapidly produce aviationrelevant turbulence estimates from Doppler radar data. Work toward processing speed optimization and better integration within the PyART framework will be highlighted. Pythonbased analysis within the PyART framework is also being done for new research related to intercomparison of groundbased radar data with satellite estimates of ocean winds, as well as research on the electrification of pyrocumulus clouds...|$|R
