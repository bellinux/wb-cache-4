40|$|Flushing {{characteristics}} of a tower tank valve flushing system with a 12 -inch-diameter manual valve were determined. Data were obtained using the outside cow alleys in a fourrow freestall barn. The alleys were 12 ft wide and 420 ft long with a 2 % slope. The average flow rate exceeded 8, 000 gallons per minute (gpm) when the average head was above 30 ft and <b>the</b> <b>manual</b> <b>valve</b> opened 80 degrees. Opening the valve to 90 degrees increased the flow rate to over 9, 700 gpm. The velocity of the flushing wave was 8. 5 fpm with a flow depth of 3. 5 in. The estimated wave duration or alley contact time was 14. 6 sec with a 25 - 40 sec release time from the flush tank. The flow rate ranged from 5, 300 gpm to 7, 200 gpm when the average head was between 16 and 28 ft...|$|E

Compared to <b>the</b> <b>manual</b> <b>valves</b> with spring type rf-shield which are {{presently}} used in the linac of the TESLA Test Facility a simplified version will be needed by cost reasons for the TESLA linear collider. Therefore wakefield induced losses for two simplified valve geometries have been studied in detail. Three types of losses are distinguished: transient and resonant losses due to wake fields induced by the valves themselves and losses due to wakes induced in the cavities. The calculations have been done for two different operation modes - linac operation and FEL operation. In addition the transverse kick has been calculated and compared with the strongest kick from a nine cell cavity. The results show, that the losses from a valve with simplified rf-shield are acceptable. 1...|$|R

50|$|The air {{pressure}} system on a tire changer provides {{the air to}} inflate tires mounted on wheels. The {{air pressure}} system consists of 4 components: air hose, air inflation gauge, inflation pedal and <b>manual</b> pressure bleed <b>valve.</b> <b>The</b> air hose is located {{near the top of}} the tire changer, and it allows compressed air to travel into the tire. A specialized end is used on the air hose to clamp firmly onto valve stems of the wheels. The air inflation gauge displays the air pressure within the tire when the air hose is connected to the valve stem. The air inflation gauge displays the pressure in pounds per square inch (psi). Directly below the air hose on the side of the tire changer is the inflation pedal that enables the inflation of the tire. When the inflation pedal is raised, a burst of air is released from valves next to each rim clamp toward the bottom bead of the tire to help with inflation. <b>The</b> <b>manual</b> bleed <b>valve</b> is located next to the air hose and air inflation gauge. <b>The</b> <b>manual</b> bleed <b>valve</b> allows <b>the</b> <b>manual</b> release of air pressure from tire.|$|R

In oxygen permeation experiments these membranes showed a peculiar behavior. Besides poor performance, a characteristic coloring also appeared {{on the surface of}} the membranes. In order to understand what was happening to the surface of the membranes, they were analysed with Low-Energy Ion Spectroscopy (LEIS) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The analyses showed that the surface of the LSCF membrane was covered with a SiO 2 layer, which obviously reduced the performance and caused the coloring. It was established that the source of the silicon was siloxane containing grease that was used in <b>the</b> <b>manual</b> <b>valves</b> of <b>the</b> setup. In a new improved permeation setup, where grease-free valves were used, the LSCF membranes showed remarkably better performance. The LEIS measurements showed also that the permeation experiment of 300 h did not affect the surface composition of the membranes. The contamination-free LSCF membranes only showed the presence of La, Sr and O in the outermost atomic layer.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} bio gas {{cleaning}} by a PSA method and modernizing of a laboratory unit. Raw bio gas contains many unwanted elements like carbon dioxide mostly which lowers its energy potential then. To extend {{the possibilities of}} usage of bio gas {{it is necessary to}} remove such elements. One of the well-known method for eliminating CO 2 out of the bio gas is the method called Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA). This work describes PSA method and compares it with other methods for cleaning the bio gas. In the following part of my work I am introducing the original laboratory PSA unit which is placed in the laboratory of UPI institution for research purposes. The modernization of the method was made by changing <b>the</b> <b>manual</b> <b>valves</b> for electromagnetic ones and there was also designed a new control system unit for two control modes.

50|$|Traditional {{control valve}} sizing for {{constant}} flow systems involves a Kv calculation, actual pressure drop calculation and {{a check to}} ensure minimum valve authority is met. This method is complicated and inflexible, as the changes in design flow, circuit pressure, and required pressure drops can change the required valve, and reduce control-ability. This method also relies on having the correct design information. Pressure independent control valves are used to limit the flow to the fan coil terminal and air handling unit. This flow is not affected by changes in inlet pressure. A diaphragm within the valve keeps the outlet pressure constant, and this delivers a constant flow to the terminal. The added advantage of pressure independent control valves is that, when fitted with an actuator, they replace <b>the</b> <b>manual</b> balancing <b>valve</b> and motorized control valve with a single valve, thus reducing installation cost.|$|R
40|$|There were 5 control <b>valves</b> and 2 <b>manual</b> <b>valves</b> for <b>the</b> liquid {{nitrogen}} distribution system {{that needed to}} be sized and procured for the upgrade. This engineering note documents the calculations done to properly size these valves. A table summarizes the valve choices. The raw calculations are attached as an appendix. The calculations jump around a bit. No effort was made to re-organize or rewrite them for the reader. The sizing calcs. on Pages 1 through 4 were first pass calcs. based on pure liquid to the valves with no attention to flashing/choking. The calcs on pages 5 through 8 then refine the calculations by considering the LN 2 to the valve inlets to be two phase with quality of 0. 032. This is a real situation if the LN 2 subcooler is out of service for use as a He cooldown heat exchanger. Also, flashing would occur for this situation and is taken into account. The end result of this refinement pushed the Cv values up by about a factor of 3 over the initial calcs. of pages 1 through 4. The results of the refined (correct) calculations pages 5 through 8 appear in the table above. The required operating Cv's are smaller than commercially available LN 2 control valves. Therefore it has been decided to use Fermilab Saver type control valve assemblies with the valve bullet Cv 1 s listed above. The bullets are 100 : 1 equal percentage types and provide better control at the lower percentage of valve Cv values. See flow characteristic data and curve for these valves in appendix B. <b>The</b> <b>manual</b> <b>valves</b> will be commercially purchased, probably a Cryolab model CV 3 - 84 - 5 WPG 2 or CV 8 - 84 - 5 WPG 2 or CVI model V- 1060 - 050 -VJ. Pages 8 - 10 calculate a minimum required cooldown flowrate as referenced in Cryogenic Systems by Barron. This was done to be sure the valves and piping system did not choke the warm flow so much that cooldown could not be achieved. The minimum mass flow rate needed for a simultaneous, serial cooldown of the refrigerator, solenoid and VLPC system was 6. 4 g/s. This warm flow would get choked by an opening less than 0. 175 -inch in diameter. A valve with only 10 psi differential across it with this flowrate would need to be Cv= 0. 85. These numbers show that cooldown will be achievable. Firstly, the flow through these components is not serial. The flows get split and sent to vent separately. Secondly, the valves are located upstream of the heat load. And lastly, the Cv of the valves are larger than 0. 85 except for the solenoid which has a very low heat load/small flow split and the VLPC's. The VLPC flow split brings the minimal required Cv for a valve situated at the warm outlet of the LN 2 circuit to be 0. 26. I foresee no, problems cooling down the LN 2 components...|$|R

As manufactured, the heater had manually–adjusted output settings between 14. 7 and 29. 3 kW (50, 000 and 100, 000 Btu/h). The heater was modified by adding a stepper motor and speed reducer to <b>the</b> <b>manual</b> proportioning <b>valve</b> to provide continuous and automated heater output adjustment between 14. 7 and 29. 3 kW. Experiments were conducted to compare animal occupied zone (AOZ) velocities, AOZ temperatures, and fuel consumption using on/off and automated variable control modes. These experiments were conducted using inside set point and ambient air temperature differences of 14 and 28 C (25 and 50 F). All experiments were conducted in the Air Dispersion Laboratory at Iowa State University. Adding automated variable control reduced the AOZ temperature fluctuations from 5. 3 C (on/off) to 1. 1 C (9. 5 to 2. 0 F). In the AOZ, the standard deviation across the entire test room was reduced from 1. 4 C (on/off) to 0. 3 C (2. 6 to 0. 5 F).

The UWS {{can operate as}} a single integrated control system or as three smaller sub-systems through <b>the</b> manipulation of <b>manual</b> <b>valves.</b> A high level of system interaction is present, which allows the use of single-input-single-output (SISO) or multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) operation, giving {{students the opportunity to}} implement various styles of control strategies. This project has focused on improving hardware, Client Software, Master Software, documentation, and the development of Student Software and an automatic operating procedure. Faulty equipment was replaced to ensure the system could perform optimally, as the hardware governed all possible system actions. The Client Software was modified to meet abnormal situation management (ASM) compliance and ensure operators have system-wide control. Further development of the Master Software has allowed an implementation of an automated operating procedure, which can demonstrate the capabilities of the system in a visually spectacular way. The Student Software was developed to create a workspace in which students can customise the user interface as well as design and implement advanced control schemes into the system, with no effect on the underlying system code. The project is now complete, with successful testing and commissioning on all aspects of the UWS. The changes have been thoroughly documented with extensive user and maintenance guides developed. There is still room to improve the UWS; however, these improvements were {{beyond the scope of this}} project. At the completion of this project, the system now allows students complete and reliable operation of the UWS through the use of a standardised interface and a fully customisable workspace...|$|R
