The theories were divided into groupings of psychological, behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, sociocultural, bio-genetic, episodic, and empirical approaches.

A discussion of special considerations in the diagnosis of alcoholism include: the use of medications with alcoholics, alcoholism and dual disorders, occupational considerations, gender considerations, cultural issues, ethnic considerations, college/university issues, and alcoholism in the elderly. Appropriate treatment and research can only occur once a proper diagnosis is made.

I use the initial population size for each subgroup as a control. My data source is the American Community Survey from the United States Census Bureau. I find that most of the effect that immigrants have on native workers is negative, however these effects are very minimal for an increase in the low-skilled immigrant population.

An increase in the native population has the greatest negative impact on native workers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This article {{deals with}} Chogoshvili cohomotopy functors which {{are defined by}} {{extending}} a cohomology functor given on some special auxiliary subcategories of the category of topological spaces. The question of choosing <b>these</b> <b>subcategories</b> <b>is</b> discussed. In particular, it is shown that in the singular case to define absolute groups it is sufficient that auxiliary subcategories should have as objects only spheres S n, Moore spaces P n (t) = S n− 1 ∪t e n, and one-point unions of these spaces. In [2, 3] for any cohomology theory H = {H n} given on some category K of pairs of topological spaces the sequence Π = {Π n}, n = 0, 1, 2, [...] ., of contravariant functors Π n is constructed from K {{into the category of}} abelian groups with the coboundary operator δ # which commutes with the induced homomorphisms ϕ #, ϕ ∈ K. Functors Π n possess the properties of semi-exactness and homotopy and are connected with H by the natural transformations d: H n → Π n which are the natural equivalences on a certain subcategory Kn of K. Constructing such functors is reduced to the problem of extending the functor given on an auxiliary subcategory Kn to the whole category K. The problem is solved by means of the theory of inverse systems of groups with sets of homomorphisms of Hurewiz, Dugundji, and Dowker [4]. Functors Π n are dual to the homotopy functors associated in the sense of Bauer [1] with a given homological structure. It should be noted that functors Π n have some of the basic properties of the Borsuk cohomotopy, but they differ from the latter. In [5 - 7] functors Π n were investigated under the assumption that K is the category of pairs of topological spaces with a base point and base point preserving maps, and H is the singular integral theory of cohomology. We will adhere to the same assumption throughout this paper (base points are not indicated here). To define functors Π n we need auxiliary subcategories Kn. We consider the problem of choosing <b>these</b> <b>subcategories...</b>|$|R

40|$|This research-creation thesis {{describes}} and {{analyzes the}} dramaturgical methodologies of verbatim theatre – {{a form of}} documentary theatre that uses transcripts as the dominant source of its dialogue – through the practical exercise of play writing. This paper marks the theoretical component of my thesis, which analyzes both the dramaturgical process and the historical context of my play Exhibit A. Using verbatim transcripts from legal evidence for its dialogue, the play examines the psychology of two teenage boys responsible for the brutal {{rape and murder of}} an 18 -year-old Canadian woman in 2010. As documentary theatre emphasizes socio-political themes, this thesis considers the dramaturgical, aesthetic, and ethical considerations of verbatim theatre through my experience as a playwright and researcher. Acknowledging both the historical antecedents of documentary theatre and its contemporary examples, this thesis will define an original typology of verbatim theatre entitled the “Subcategories of Verbatim Theatre”. <b>These</b> <b>subcategories</b> <b>are</b> identified as Tribunal, Literary, Historical Drama, Expository and Participatory. Each privileges different types and usages of documents, which are further defined as being primarily related to “text” or “aural” based testimony. The thesis relates the dramaturgical principles of each subcategory to artistic choices made in Exhibit A. A description of the various incarnations of verbatim and documentary theatre, as well as an analysis of my experience as a documentary playwright examines the dramatic representation of reality as highly constructed in this form of theatre where the selection and editing of a documentary play's archive is a creative process that is not dissimilar from the creation of fictional drama. In that sense, the documentary genre can be said to present a dramatic representation of the playwright's subjective version of the truth. Exhibit A thus stands as my creative reconstruction of the evidence presented in the Kimberly Proctor murder trial...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, {{financial}} markets have been highlighted by large-scale financial failures due to incompetence and fraud, such as Barings, Daiwa, Allied Irish Banks, UBS, Société Génerale, and more recently JP Morgan. While previous research has focussed on market and credit risk, {{and even if the}} focus was on operational risk it concentrates on the market reaction to operational losses, the current research addresses the root of the problem. The current research explores the final notices issued by the FSA (now FCA and PRA) of over £ 1, 000, 000 from 2008 - 2013 in order to find a common theme in the operational risks of the financial institutions. In order to categorise the final notices a framework by McConnell (2008) has been adopted. With the help of this framework the risks are more accurately distinguished in either an incident, individual, institution, or industry area. The data analysis the frequently breached principles outlined by the FSA ‘principles for business’. The results from this allow the accurate categorisation of each case, and allow us to see where financial institution most often commit operational risks. The findings indicate {{that the vast majority of}} operational risks occur on an institutional level; however, the findings also show that no cases were attributed to solely the incident or industry area. Furthermore, two subcategories have been created in order to place the cases more accurately, <b>these</b> <b>subcategories</b> <b>are</b> a combination of the already existing areas; the individual and institution area, and the industry and institution area. This makes the tally for institutional area increase, and results in only 3 cases involving no institutional factors whatsoever. With these results suggestions to minimise the frequency and severity of operational risks are made in the form of adopting either a new regulatory body, which has already happened. The further suggestions include adopting a Dodd-Frank Act stress testing similar approach to risk management of financial institutions, or applying the Enterprise Wide Risk Management (EWRM) framework in order to stop risks in the earlier stages. However, it is important to consider the definition of risk, as it is not necessarily deemed a bad thing, especially for financial institutions who most take some risks in order to maintain competitive and profitable, the suggestions are therefore recommendations on determining what the good, and the bad risks are...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Bourdieu’s {{theory of}} relationalism moves beyond the {{objective}} and subjective, to analyze a field, or social space, and unearth {{the perspective of}} individuals within society. Individuals operate these settings with an ongoing tension, as they determine whether to struggle against or reproduce valued principles, objectives and dispositions. In this way, they negotiate sometimes obvious, sometimes unwritten, expectations. This theoretical framework offers {{a unique opportunity to}} examine inculcation during schooling, by considering relational aspects between education policies and students, their intended targets. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate how Finnish education policies’ aims and principles for basic education relate to what students perceive is expected of them. This necessitates a reflexive examination of students’ perceived purpose of schooling itself. The investigation is thus conducted from two data sets: a field analysis of education policy documents, and then a congruent categorization of dispositions and perceptions that the students voiced in semi-structured interviews. The latter culminates in a habitus investigation, or consideration of their choices to struggle or reproduce societal characteristics. The analysis extracts emergent themes along societal principles, characteristics and the purpose of schooling, and student dispositions from both data sets. Statements that relate to <b>these</b> <b>subcategories</b> <b>are</b> then discussed congruently, with consideration of similarities and differences within and among data sets. Overall, policies describe a school system that is flexibly designed, in order to maximize inclusiveness and individualization, and to promote agency and student self-knowledge. Students describe how they are personally unstressed by external pressures, and feel self-efficacious and able to determine their own paths based on personal motivation and effort. Schooling purposes range from the intrinsic to its role in formulating a knowledge economy. While students’ roles and expectations are barely described in the examined education policy documents, the great amount of agency and self-responsibility prescribed to them is indirectly thematic in its statements. Many overlaps exist among what is intended by policy and what students perceive, but the differences inform the complex nature of influences on any sociological field. By considering the struggles and self-beliefs of students, policy makers may surface unanticipated barriers or obstacles, lessening the gap between the theoretical and practical design of policies. This lends itself to the inclusion of students’ voices, and particularly of qualitative semi-structured interviews, in education policy evaluation...|$|E

Interaction between {{tourists}} and people working in the tourism industry {{is an essential part}} of the experience provided to the tourists. The focus of this study is on how multicultural workers in experience tourism in Inari area interact with international tourists. Another focus is how the workers act together as a multicultural team. The empirical part of this study focuses on one company located in the municipality of Inari. The interviews concentrated on gathering stories of both successful as well as challenging events of the interaction and teamwork. The stories were analyzed using a narrative structure. Due to the small amount of stories gathered, the rest of the transcribed interview data was also analyzed by using content analysis. The analyzed data was divided into two categories: tourist-worker interaction and multicultural teamwork. These two main categories were further divided into subcategories, namely: language, communicative competencies, professional competencies and intercultural awareness. <b>These</b> <b>subcategories</b> <b>were</b> discussed following a review of intercultural communication literature. Multicultural teamwork has two subcategories: teamwork and “it always works for us”. These were discussed following a review of multicultural teamwork literature. In the case study company, the success factors are: careful planning and training, good co-operation between the teams, flexibility, as well as experienced and professional workers. The findings show that the workers in the experience tourism industry need foreign language, interaction, and intercultural skills as well as their professional competencies. The major challenges the workers face when interacting with tourists are most likely caused by the assumption of the similarities and the difficulties in interpreting nonverbal communication. The analysis of the multicultural team remains rather superficial due to the work division of the case company. Based on the findings of this research the influence of multiculturalism of Inari does not seem to have a significant impact on the interaction and teamwork in the case study company...|$|R
