500|$|Lincoln's {{view of the}} Declaration became influential, {{seeing it}} as a moral guide to {{interpreting}} the Constitution. [...] "For most people now," [...] wrote Garry Wills in 1992, [...] "the Declaration means what Lincoln <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>it</b> means, {{as a way of}} correcting the Constitution itself without overthrowing it." [...] Admirers of Lincoln such as Harry V. Jaffa praised this development. Critics of Lincoln, notably Willmoore Kendall and Mel Bradford, argued that Lincoln dangerously expanded the scope of the national government and violated states' rights by reading the Declaration into the Constitution.|$|E
500|$|In 1776, Franciscan missionary Silvestre VÃ©lez de Escalante {{was trying}} to find a land route from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to Monterey, California. His party {{included}} twelve Spanish colonials and two Utes from the Utah Valley Timpanogots band who acted as guides. On 23 September 1776, the party entered Utah Valley at the present-day city of Spanish Fork. The local Timanogots villagers hosted them and told them of the lake to the north. [...] In his journal, Escalante described Utah Lake as a [...] "lake, which must be six leagues wide and fifteen leagues long, [...] extends as far as one of these valleys. It runs northwest through a narrow passage, and according to what they <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>it</b> communicates with others much larger." [...] The Great Salt Lake was described as the [...] "other lake with which this one communicates, according to what they told us, [...] covers many leagues, and its waters are noxious and extremely salty." ...|$|E

500|$|For his part, anchor Mike Wallace came {{to regret}} his {{participation}} in the episode. [...] "I should have known better," [...] he said in 1992. Speaking in 1996, Wallace stated, [...] "That is [...] God help us [...] what our understanding was of the homosexual lifestyle a mere twenty-five years ago because nobody {{was out of the}} closet and because that's what we heard from doctors [...] that's what Socarides <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>it</b> was a matter of shame." [...] However, Wallace was at the time of broadcast close friends with noted designer James Amster (creator of the landmark Amster Yard courtyard in New York City) and Amster's male long-term companion, men whom Wallace later described as [...] "a wonderful old married couple" [...] and [...] "oth people that [...] admired". Despite this personal knowledge, Wallace relied on the American Psychiatric Association's categorization of homosexuality as a mental illness rather than his own experience in creating the episode. As recently as 1995, Wallace told an interviewer that he believed homosexuals could change their orientation if they really wanted to.|$|E

The soldiers spoke under condition of anonymity. One acknowledged that they were encouraged by their commander after the attack: [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>it</b> was war. Come on, the bastards fire at you, what can you do? He told us we were firing well and we should keep it up, and that Arabs, you know there are millions of them," [...] Soldier A was quoted as saying. Another artilleryman, Soldier T, was quoted as saying that [...] "no-one spoke about it {{as if it was a}} mistake. We did our job and we are at peace with that. Even 'S' told us we were great and that they were just a bunch of Arabs (in Hebrew, 'arabushim')...How many Arabs are there and how many Jews? A few 'arabushim' die, there is no harm in that." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by another soldier, Soldier Y, who remarked, [...] "it's a war, in a war these things happen...It's just a bunch of Arabs. Why are you taking it so hard?" [...] An official army spokesman's statement questioned the accuracy of Kol Ha'ir report.|$|E
