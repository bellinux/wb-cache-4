5|$|I am not {{too sure}} if John {{actually}} fully {{understood what he}} was saying. He knew he was onto something when he saw <b>those</b> <b>words</b> and turned them into a song. But to have experienced what the lyrics in that song are actually about? I don't know if he fully understood it.|$|E
5|$|In Arabic, {{the word}} for street (الشارع, ash-shāriʿ) is derived from a root whose other forms denote a place of entry or beginning, {{the point of a}} weapon, and law or {{lawfulness}} and legitimacy in both the secular and religious sense. Among <b>those</b> <b>words</b> are sharia, the term for Islamic religious and moral law. Shāriʿ itself {{can also be used to}} refer to a legislator or lawgiver, and when used with the definite article al- in a religious context is a reference to God as the source of all religious law.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all <b>those</b> <b>words.</b> She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E

25|$|The Auditorium was {{intended}} as a type of university meeting hall, <b>those</b> <b>words</b> being, in fact, inscribed over the entrance. Its domed roof is exactly one-eighth of a sphere.|$|E
25|$|Many Sanskrit loanwords orthographically end in i, {{though in}} Gujarati {{there is now}} no phonetic {{difference}} between i and ī, so <b>those</b> <b>words</b> {{could just as well}} be held as marked feminines.|$|E

25|$|Nouns are inflected {{by number}} and gender. Inflection by {{grammatical}} number (singular and plural) is clearly distinguished in feminine nouns, but not masculine nouns, where pronunciation is generally identical for <b>those</b> <b>words</b> {{ending with a}} vowel.|$|E
25|$|The last verse of the hymn How Firm a Foundation {{played a}} role in the dark days of 1838 at Haun's Mill settlement. <b>Those</b> <b>words</b> of comfort came to Amanda Smith during a time of sorrow and distress.|$|E
25|$|Listeners {{wondered}} who the mystery lady was singing <b>those</b> <b>words</b> in Duncan's song. Because of this, Fricke {{was able to}} gain a recording contract of her own from Columbia Records, where she remained over 10 years, beginning in 1977.|$|E

25|$|A {{very strong}} {{way to express}} anger or {{frustration}} {{is to use the}} words tabarnak, sacrament, and câlice. Depending on the context and the tone of the phrases, it might make everybody quiet, but some people use <b>those</b> <b>words</b> to add rhythm or emphasis to sentences.|$|E
25|$|Ignatieff recanted <b>those</b> <b>words</b> the {{following}} week. Then, on October 11, 2006, Ignatieff described the Qana attack {{as a war}} crime (committed by Israel). Susan Kadis, who had previously been Ignatieff's campaign co-chair, withdrew her support following the comment. Other Liberal leadership candidates have also criticized Ignatieff's comments.|$|E
25|$|I {{would have}} the weakest woman read the Gospels and the Epistles of St Paul. I would have <b>those</b> <b>words</b> {{translated}} into all languages, so that not only Scots and Irishmen, but Turks and Saracens might read them. I long for the ploughboy to sing them {{to himself as he}} follows the plow, the weaver to hum them to the tune of his shuttle, the traveler to beguile with them the dullness of his journey.|$|E
60|$|All {{day long}} {{the music of}} <b>those</b> inspiring <b>words</b> sang through <b>those</b> people's heads.|$|R

25|$|After each clue was given, the {{contestant}} {{sought out}} the word and circled it with an electronic pencil on the screen once he/she found it. Passing was allowed if a contestant got stuck on a word, and if time permitted the champion could play <b>those</b> <b>words</b> again once all ten clues were given. Finding all ten words before time ran out won the contestant the jackpot. If not, $100 was given for each word that had been found before time expired.|$|E
25|$|Tagalog {{vocabulary}} {{is composed}} mostly of words of native Austronesian origin - {{most of the}} words that end with the diphthongs -iw, (e.g. saliw) and <b>those</b> <b>words</b> that exhibit reduplication (e.g. halo-halo, patpat, etc.). However it has {{a significant number of}} Spanish loanwords. Spanish is the language that has bequeathed the most loanwords to Tagalog. According to linguists, Spanish has even surpassed Malay in terms of loanwords borrowed. About 40% of everyday (informal) Tagalog conversation is practically made up of Spanish loanwords.|$|E
25|$|The {{content of}} the OED2 is mostly just a {{reorganization}} of the earlier corpus, but the retypesetting provided an opportunity for two long-needed format changes. The headword of each entry was no longer capitalized, allowing the user to readily see <b>those</b> <b>words</b> that actually require a capital letter. Murray had devised his own notation for pronunciation, there being no standard available at the time, whereas the OED2 adopted the modern International Phonetic Alphabet. Unlike the earlier edition, all foreign alphabets except Greek were transliterated.|$|E

25|$|The Koine Greek terms {{used in the}} New Testament of the {{structure}} on which Jesus died are stauros (σταυρός) and xylon (ξύλον). <b>Those</b> <b>words,</b> which can refer to many different things, do not indicate the precise shape of {{the structure}}. Scholars {{have long known that}} the Greek word stauros and the Latin word crux did not uniquely mean a cross. They have known too that the words had that meaning also, and so have not considered necessarily incorrect the traditional picture of a cross with transom.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{have shown}} that this problem is intimately linked {{with the ability to}} parse language, and that <b>those</b> <b>words</b> that are easy to segment due to their high {{transitional}} probabilities are also easier to map to an appropriate referent. This serves as further evidence of the developmental progression of language acquisition, with children requiring an understanding of the sound distributions of natural languages to form phonetic categories, parse words based on these categories, and then use these parses to map them to objects as labels.|$|E
25|$|I cannot assent to that {{assertion}} {{of power in}} those terms. Sec. 38, par. (u), of the Act authorizes the Court to give all such directions and do all such things as it deems necessary or expedient in the premises. I apprehend that <b>those</b> <b>words</b> empower the President {{to deal with all}} matters incidental and ancillary, provided they are within the ambit of the dispute submitted to him. But the Court cannot of its own motion give directions in a matter not substantially involved in or connected with the disputes submitted to it.|$|E
