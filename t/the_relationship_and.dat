5|$|The term {{attachment}} {{disorder is}} used to describe emotional and behavioral problems of young children, and also applied to school-age children, teenagers and adults. The specific difficulties implied depend on {{the age of the}} individual being assessed, and a child's attachment-related behaviors may be very different with one familiar adult than with another, suggesting that the disorder is within <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>and</b> interactions of the two people rather than an aspect of one or the other personality. No list of symptoms can legitimately be presented but generally the term attachment disorder refers to the absence or distortion of age appropriate social behaviors with adults. For example, in a toddler, attachment-disordered behavior could include a failure to stay near familiar adults in a strange environment or to be comforted by contact with a familiar person, whereas in a six-year-old attachment-disordered behavior might involve excessive friendliness and inappropriate approaches to strangers.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>and</b> {{interactions}} among memory, educational inheritance and history are tackled.

Then, <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>and</b> interactions between memory and educational inheritance are studied (exhibitions, researches, scientific societies, conferences, groups and projects of research, international statements and recommendations as well as pedagogical museism). Finally, {{some of the issues}} arising from the safeguard and cataloguing of the educational inheritance are set out: the need to connect them with its study, the diversity of its uses and values, the problems related to the changes occurring in the technological supports of memory, and the intergenerational preservations and transmission of knowledge, namely of the cultural and educational legacy or inheritance...|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> between {{biodiversity}} <b>and</b> {{ecosystem function}} (BEF), has interested many ecologists.
