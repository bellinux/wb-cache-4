40|$|Today, {{more and}} more people are sitting, both at work and on their leisure time. And for many people, this creates {{problems}} in back, neck and shoulders etcetera. In many companies, therapists like naprapaths, chiropractors and masseuses are hired to help the staff with their problems. When these therapists are visiting the companies, they are in need of a portable <b>treatment</b> <b>table,</b> where they can execute their treatments.   At the therapist's clinic they usually have a very robust <b>treatment</b> <b>table,</b> that can easily be raised and lowered. However, when the therapist needs to execute their treatment at another location, this option is no longer available, due to the limited construction of the portable <b>treatment</b> <b>tables</b> today. This leads to a non-ergonomic working position for the therapist during the manipulations he or she needs to be doing. Also it leads to a non-optimal treatment for the patient. To get a better ergonomic, and more optimal working position, a lightweight portable <b>treatment</b> <b>table</b> is being developed. This portable <b>treatment</b> <b>table</b> can easily be adjusted in height. Due to its lightweight construction, the therapist´s can still easily carry the table and the therapist also get some of the benefits from a stationary <b>treatment</b> <b>table.</b> This result, offers a more ergonomic working position for the therapist and also a more optimal treatment for the patient, compared to the previous alternatives on the market today. In this project, a fully functional <b>treatment</b> <b>table,</b> has been developed as an alternative to the portable <b>treatment</b> <b>tables</b> today. The portable <b>treatment</b> <b>table</b> which been produced, offers adjustments in height, and also other components to attract a wider market.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{investigate}} {{the presence of}} pathogenic microbes on chiropractic <b>treatment</b> <b>tables</b> in one outpatient teaching clinic. Additional aims were to test inexpensive disinfectants on tables that may kill microbes and suggest infection control measures for chiropractic offices, clinics and classrooms. The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the presence of pathogenic microbes on <b>treatment</b> <b>tables</b> in one outpatient teaching clinic and determine a simple behavioral model for infection control including table disinfection and accepted hand washing and sanitizing protocols. Methods 10 <b>treatment</b> <b>tables</b> were selected and sampled for possible microbial flora on face and hand pieces. Samples were cultured on MacConky's agar and mannitol salt agar, labeled and incubated for up to 48 hours. Confirmatory testing of microbes to determine if drug resistant flora were present was performed. Among tables tested, 5 were selected to test disinfectants. One-half of the face piece and 1 hand piece were treated with two different wipes and then post-tested for microbes. Results Pathogenic microbes were present on chiropractic <b>treatment</b> <b>tables</b> including methicillin-resistant Staph aureus. Simple disinfectants neutralized the pathogens. A rudimentary disinfection procedure and infection control measures are suggested based on the findings. Conclusion Pathogenic microbes may be present on chiropractic <b>treatment</b> <b>tables</b> and can be effectively killed with proper disinfecting. Hand washing/sanitizing is an important measure in infection control as is table disinfecting. Rudimentary behavioral changes to improve chiropractic clinic infection control are needed. More comprehensive behavioral models are needed. All teaching clinics and private chiropractic offices should adopt infection control practices including routine table disinfecting and hand sanitizing. Effective measures can be put in place at minimal costs. Accrediting bodies of chiropractic institutions should mandate an infection control plan for member institutions immediately. </p...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change can}} be {{expected}} to increase the frequency of summer droughts and associated low water tables in ombrotrophic peatlands. We studied the effects of periodic water table drawdown in a mesocosm experiment. Mesocosms were collected in Southern Sweden, and subsequently brought to an experimental field in the Netherlands. <b>Two</b> water <b>table</b> <b>treatments</b> were applied: one with constant water tables at 5 cm below the moss surface, and one in which the water table was allowed to drop, resulting in water tables fluctuating between 5 and 21 cm below the moss surface. Sphagnum growth, as well as Sphagnum and vascular plant abundance, were assessed for 2 frac(1, 2) years. Our results show that the abundance of graminoid species increased most in the constant water <b>table</b> <b>treatment.</b> In contrast, ericoid species cover increased when water tables were allowed to fluctuate. Furthermore, Sphagnum cuspidatum production decreased with fluctuating summer water tables, while Sphagnum magellanicum responded oppositely. From these results we conclude that increased occurrence of periods with low water tables may bring about a shift in dominant Sphagnum species as well as a shift from graminoid to ericoid vascular plant cover, resembling the shift from hollow to lawn or hummock vegetation. The difference in response within functional groups (vascular plants, Sphagnum) may add to the resilience of the ecosystem. © 2008 Gesellschaft für Ökologie. </p...|$|R

30|$|Overall, {{concentrations}} of P in the leachate and leaching loads of P from the clay loam significantly increased {{in all three}} treatments with either mineral P or pig slurry compared with the control (Table 5) and to before P application (Table 6). The concentrations were also significantly higher than those from the columns with loamy sand after P applications. Surface-applied pig slurry to the columns (SP-Surf) had a mean TP concentration of 2.76 mg L- 1, which was the highest among all the treatments. The next highest concentration was from the mineral P (MinP, 1.50 mg L- 1) and then incorporation of pig slurry (SP-Incor, 1.39 mg L- 1) <b>treatments</b> (<b>Table</b> 5). The latter <b>two</b> <b>treatments</b> had significantly lower {{concentrations of}} TP in the leachate compared with SP-Surf, {{but there was no}} significant difference between them.

40|$|Peatland landscapes {{typically}} exhibit large {{variations in}} greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to microtopographic and vegetation heterogeneity. As many peatland budgets are extrapolated from small-scale chamber measurements {{it is important}} to both quantify and understand the processes underlying this spatial variability. Here we carried out a mesocosm study which allowed a comparison to be made between different microtopographic features and vegetation communities, in response to conditions of both static and changing water table. Three mesocosm types (hummocks[*]+[*]Juncus effusus, hummocks[*]+[*]Eriophorum vaginatum, and hollows dominated by moss) were subjected to <b>two</b> water <b>table</b> <b>treatments</b> (0 – 5 cm and 30 – 35 cm depth). Measurements were made of soil-atmosphere GHG exchange, GHG concentration within the peat profile and soil water solute concentrations. After 14 weeks the high water table group was drained and the low water table group flooded. Measurement intensity was then increased to examine the immediate response to change in water table position. Mean CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O exchange across all chambers was 39. 8 μg m− 2 s− 1, 54. 7 μg m− 2 h− 1 and − 2. 9 μg m− 2 h− 1, respectively. Hence the GHG budget was dominated in this case by CO 2 exchange. CO 2 and N 2 O emissions were highest in the low water <b>table</b> <b>treatment</b> group; CH 4 emissions were highest in the saturated mesocosms. We observed a strong interaction between mesocosm type and water table for CH 4 emissions. In contrast to many previous studies, we found that the presence of aerenchyma-containing vegetation reduced CH 4 emissions. A significant pulse in both CH 4 and N 2 O emissions occurred within 1 – 2 days of switching the water <b>table</b> <b>treatments.</b> This pulsing could potentially lead to significant underestimation of landscape annual GHG budgets when widely spaced chamber measurements are upscaled. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{develop a}} simple, {{comprehensive}} outline {{for the treatment}} of caisson disease and traumatic air embolism. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 1. Twenty-seven first class divers and six pharmacist's mates under-going training for qualification as second class divers participated in the various tests. 2. To test the <b>treatment</b> <b>tables,</b> divers were exposed to a one-hour work dive at 130 feet, and then one hour following decompression, recompression was applied according to the particular <b>treatment</b> <b>table</b> under study. In some instances the period on the surface between the dive and the treatment was decreased to thirty minutes. Although the divers seldom developed bends after the work dive, nitrogen apparently was present in the tissues in a state of supersaturation or in the form of minute bubbles. Thus, a second exposure, i. e., treatment, one hour after the work dive was usually followed by bends unless the decompression was prolonged. The decompression time required t...|$|R
