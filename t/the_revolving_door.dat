25|$|A {{revolving}} door has {{three or four}} doors that hang on a center shaft and rotate around a vertical axis within a round enclosure. In high-rise buildings, regular doors are hard to open because of air pressure differentials. In order to address this problem, <b>the</b> <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> was invented in 1888 by Theophilus Van Kannel of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Van Kannel patented <b>the</b> <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> on August 7, 1888.|$|E

25|$|In lobbying, <b>the</b> <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> is the cycling {{of former}} federal {{employees}} into jobs as lobbyists while former K Street employees are pulled into government positions. Government officials can only work certain terms in their positions, for example senators, and afterwards they form valuable connections {{that could help}} influence future law making. The other form of <b>the</b> <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> is pushing lobbyists into government positions, and then developing connections and returning into the lobbying world to use said connections. This is a controversial issue in the political lobbying world.|$|E
25|$|The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act is a {{bill that}} was signed on September 15, 2007 by President George W. Bush, {{amending}} the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995. Included in the bill are certain provisions that require a quarterly reports on lobby spending by organizations, places restrictions on gifts for Congress members and provides for mandatory disclosure of earmarks in expenditure bills. This act places restrictions on <b>the</b> <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> in direct lobbying.|$|E

This new work was partially facilitated through his wiki, Lessig Wiki, which he has encouraged the public to use to document cases of corruption. Lessig criticized <b>the</b> <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> phenomenon in which legislators and staffers leave office to become lobbyists and have become beholden to special interests.|$|E
500|$|The {{ensemble}} of mosaics, sculptures, and bronze of the Marquette Building entry and interior honors Jacques Marquette’s 1674-5 expedition. [...] Four bas relief panels over {{the main entrance}} by sculptor Hermon Atkins MacNeil show different scenes from Marquette's trip through the Great Lakes region, ending with one depicting his burial. <b>The</b> <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> panels feature carvings of panther's heads. The hexagonal railing around the lobby atrium is decorated with a mosaic frieze by the Tiffany studio depicting events {{in the life of}} Jacques Marquette, his exploration of Illinois, and Native Americans he met. The mosaics are by Louis Comfort Tiffany and his chief designer and art director, Jacob Adolph Holzer; they contain panels of lustered Tiffany glass, mother-of-pearl, and semi-precious stones.|$|E
500|$|Chapter three {{describes}} {{the concept of}} [...] "regulatory capture," [...] whereby a regulator– such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK, or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States– ends up advancing {{the interests of the}} drug companies rather than the interests of the public. Goldacre writes that this happens for a number of reasons, including <b>the</b> <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> of employees between the regulator and the companies, and the fact that friendships develop between regulator and company employees simply because they have knowledge and interests in common. The chapter also discusses surrogate outcomes and accelerated approval, and the difficulty of having ineffective drugs removed from the market once they have been approved. He argues that regulators do not require that new drugs offer an improvement over what is already available, or even that they be particularly effective.|$|E

500|$|The 1993 Hal Prince revival, {{originating}} in Toronto, was deliberately staged to cast attention on racial disparities; throughout the production, African-American actors constantly cleaned up messes, appeared {{to move the}} sets (even when hydraulics actually moved them), and performed other menial tasks. After a New Year's Eve ball, all the streamers fell {{on the floor and}} African Americans immediately began sweeping them away. A montage in the second act showed time passing using <b>the</b> <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> of the Palmer House in Chicago, with newspaper headlines being shown in quick succession, and snippets of slow motion to highlight a specific moment, accompanied by brief snippets of Ol' Man River. African-American dancers were seen performing a specific dance, and this would change to a scene showing white dancers performing the same dance. This was meant to illustrate how white performers [...] "appropriated" [...] the music and dancing styles of African Americans. Earlier productions of Show Boat, even the 1927 stage original and the 1936 film version, did not go this far in social commentary.|$|E

2500|$|The next {{fourteen}} years were hard ones for the once-proud franchise. Springfield {{went through a}} dizzying array of NHL affiliations, while no coach stayed longer than a single season. <b>The</b> <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> did their on-ice record no good. [...] Over that stretch, the Indians recorded only two winning seasons and only made the playoffs four times, winning but four playoff games. There were only sporadic bright spots; a scoring title from minor-league great Bruce Boudreau in 1988, quality seasons from future NHLers Charlie Simmer and Mario Lessard in 1978, and a league-leading season in goal in 1983 from Bob Janecyk.|$|E

[...] One evening, Buranelli's final story was about an actress going into a Los Angeles hotel with a Great Dane. The dog's tail got caught in <b>the</b> <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> and she sued the hotel for $10,000. Buranelli added a comment to the story to give Thomas a laugh before going on air, but Thomas read the story as written with Buranelli's comment, [...] "Who ever thought a piece of tail was worth 10 grand." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> {{that was}} Canned Heat {{continued}} as Vestine and Watson made their {{returns to the}} lineup as the [...] "Heavy Artillery" [...] band. Several former members including Mandel, Barron and Taylor joined up in de la Parra's effort for the album, Internal Combustion, which was released in 1994, but saw only limited release due to the returning manager Skip Taylor's falling out with Red River Records. In 1995, James Thornbury left the band with no hard feelings after ten years of service to live the married life in New South Wales, Australia and new front-man Robert Lucas came in to take his place. Mandel returned and Shumake left the band in 1996, and after the position of bassist was taken temporarily by Mark [...] "Pocket" [...] Goldberg, [...] Greg Kage took the reins as the bass player, and after a reconciliation with Larry Taylor the band released, Canned Heat Blues Band, in 1996. On October 20, 1997, a tired and cancer stricken Vestine died in Paris, France following the final gig of a European tour. Taylor and Watson subsequently left the band.|$|E

60|$|The town, for {{the most}} part, was built of wood, {{and some of the}} smaller and older houses of logs, with ugly square fronts that hid the roof. A high, plank {{sidewalk}} ran down the main street, so that foot passengers might avoid the mud, but the ruts and holes were now hidden by beaten snow. At one end stood a big smelter, which filled the place with acrid fumes, and the scream of saws rose from sheds beside the river, where rusty iron smoke-stacks towered above sawdust dumps. The green torrent was partly covered by cakes of grinding ice. All round, in marked contrast to the utilitarian ugliness below, dark pines ran up to the glittering snowfields on the shoulders of the peaks. Foster went to a big new hotel, which he found dirty and too hot. Its bare walls were cracked and exuded resin; black drops from the central heater pipes stained the rotunda floor, which was torn by the spikes on the river-Jacks' boots. An electric elevator made a horrible noise. The supper he got in the big dining-room, where an electric organ played, was, however, very good, and he afterwards sat rather drearily in the rotunda, watching the men who came in and out through <b>the</b> <b>revolving</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He had no appetite, but {{the custom}} of dining is too strong. And while he ate, he glanced with {{irritation}} at his fellow-members. They looked so at their ease. Unjust--that this black cloud should hang over one blameless as any of them! Friends, connoisseurs of such things--a judge among them--came specially to his table to express their admiration of his conduct of that will case. Tonight he had real excuse for pride, but he felt none. Yet, in this well-warmed quietly glowing room, filled with decorously eating, decorously talking men, he gained insensibly some comfort. This surely was reality; that shadowy business out there only the drear sound of a wind one must and did keep out--like the poverty and grime which had no real existence for the secure and prosperous. He drank champagne. It helped to fortify reality, to make shadows seem more shadowy. And down in the smoking-room he sat before the fire, {{in one of those}} chairs which embalm after-dinner dreams. He grew sleepy there, and at eleven o'clock rose to go home. But when he had once passed down the shallow marble steps, out through <b>the</b> <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> which let in no draughts, he was visited by fear, as if he had drawn it in with the breath of the January wind. Larry's face; and the girl watching it! Why had she watched like that? Larry's smile; and the flowers in his hand? Buying flowers at such a moment! The girl was his slave-whatever he told her, she would do. But she {{would never be able to}} stop him. At this very moment he might be rushing to give himself up! ...|$|E
