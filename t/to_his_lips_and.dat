25|$|A figure {{holding a}} large horn <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> {{clasping}} a sword {{on his hip}} appears on a stone cross from the Isle of Man. Some scholars have theorized that this figure is a depiction of Heimdallr with Gjallarhorn.|$|E
60|$|Stephen {{raised his}} glass <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> drained its contents.|$|E
60|$|George {{raised the}} letter <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> kissed it vigorously.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} the little group who had thought prudence {{the better part}} of valour had reached the door. The foremost man amongst them opened it and peered cautiously out into the darkness. He turned back to those behind him, put a finger <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> beckoned <b>to</b> them to follow him in silence.|$|R
60|$|Stephen {{set down}} the cup, which he had just raised <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> untasted, <b>and</b> rose hastily.|$|R
60|$|He {{filled it}} to the brim, and Ughtred, who was thirsty, raised it gladly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> Reist <b>and</b> Brand waited.|$|R
60|$|Reggie {{raised her}} hand <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> <b>and</b> nibbled at it gently.|$|E
60|$|Maraton {{raised his}} glass <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> sipped the wine critically.|$|E
60|$|He took it, {{raised it}} silently <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> <b>and</b> dropped it again.|$|E
6000|$|We {{had made}} the tea, and were just {{settling}} down comfortably to drink it, when George, with <b>his</b> cup half-way <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> paused <b>and</b> exclaimed: ...|$|R
60|$|And Fatty, alias Percival Delaney, a {{grotesque}} of manhood, put <b>his</b> bulgy hand <b>to</b> <b>his</b> puffed <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> kissed audibly into the starry vault of the sky.|$|R
60|$|She was {{trembling}} and half afraid, but her hands yielded their pressure <b>to</b> <b>his.</b> Her <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> her eyes, the little quivering of her body, all spoke of yielding.|$|R
60|$|Herr Freudenberg sighed. Slowly {{he raised}} his glass <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> drank.|$|E
60|$|Paul put {{his hand}} hastily <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> <b>and</b> looked over the garden.|$|E
60|$|He {{raised his}} companion's hand <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> drew her arm through his.|$|E
60|$|So was the cook; a glow which {{increased}} to fever heat as the youth raised the mug <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> again, <b>and</b> slowly drained it {{and handed it}} to him to wash up.|$|R
5000|$|... Bradwell and 3 {{friends were}} sitting at a nearby table. Bradwell dropped an ID {{on the floor and}} Mrs. Galaviz-Hernandez picked it up to give back to Bradwell. Bradwell made a {{derogatory}} comment toward the woman. The woman’s husband overheard the comment and asked Bradwell to “show some respect.” Bradwell stood up and struck the victim, causing him <b>to</b> fall hitting <b>his</b> head on the floor. Galaviz-Hernandez woke up at Via Christi-St. Francis Medical Center where he received 5 stitches <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> 3 staples <b>to</b> the back of his head." ...|$|R
60|$|The guard, {{with the}} whistle already half-way <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> paused <b>and</b> {{glanced at his}} watch. There was a {{fraction}} of a moment left. He stepped to a carriage and threw open a door.|$|R
60|$|He {{lifted my}} hand <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> <b>and</b> fixed a last {{attentive}} look on me.|$|E
60|$|Draconmeyer {{turned his}} head. He, too, raised his wine <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> drank deliberately.|$|E
60|$|He {{lifted his}} finger <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> <b>and</b> came close under my window before he answered.|$|E
60|$|When he was {{thirteen}} years old {{the boy was}} sent to a High School in the County town. He did not like it. His Cousin Matilda had longed to make a little gentleman of him, but he refused to be made. He would give a little contemptuous curve <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip,</b> <b>and</b> take on a shy, charity-boy grin, when refinement was thrust upon him. He played truant from the High School, sold his books, his cap with its badge, even his very scarf and pocket-handkerchief, <b>to</b> <b>his</b> school-fellows, and went raking off heaven knows where with the money. So he spent two very unsatisfactory years.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the film}} Dr. Dolittle (1998), while the titular doctor is {{committed}} to a mental hospital, he watches an episode of Mister Ed {{with two of the}} hospital's orderlies, who discuss their theories of how Mister Ed was trained <b>to</b> move <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> [...] "talk".|$|R
6000|$|He put <b>his</b> finger <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> nodded, <b>and</b> peered round. [...] "Lollipops for Sannie," [...] {{he whispered}} low, at last, with a guilty smile. [...] "But"--he glanced about him again--"give them to me, please, when Tant Mettie isn't looking." [...] His nod was all mystery.|$|R
60|$|Here he {{put another}} marrow-bone <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> <b>and</b> sucked out the {{contents}} with infinite gusto.|$|E
60|$|And {{with that}} he put a whistle <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> blew a long shrill blast.|$|E
60|$|He {{hated the}} lie which had risen so readily <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> choked it back.|$|E
60|$|The two {{passed on}} {{after a few}} more moments of amiable but, {{on the part of the}} young man, {{somewhat}} dazed conversation. Philip had resumed the consumption of his chicken. He raised an over-filled glass <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> steadily <b>and</b> drank it without spilling a drop.|$|R
60|$|Of all men alive, {{this was}} one of the last he would have wished to meet at any time; but, now that he {{recognised}} in him only the patron and protector of Nicholas, he would rather have seen a spectre. One beneficial effect, however, the encounter had upon him. It instantly roused all his dormant energies; rekindled in his breast the passions that, for many years, had found an improving home there; called up all his wrath, hatred, and malice; restored the sneer <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip,</b> <b>and</b> the scowl <b>to</b> <b>his</b> brow; and made him again, in all outward appearance, the same Ralph Nickleby whom so many had bitter cause to remember.|$|R
60|$|Dick drew himself close <b>to</b> her, {{compressing}} <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> pouting them out, {{as if he}} {{were about}} to whistle the softest melody known.|$|R
60|$|Julien {{lifted his}} tumbler of whiskey and soda <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> {{set it down}} empty.|$|E
60|$|He {{lifted the}} long glass <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> sipped it slowly to soothe away his irritation.|$|E
60|$|He {{took my hand}} fervently, {{raised it}} with warmth <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> kissed it twice over.|$|E
60|$|Adam {{opened his}} eyes, {{and made some}} inarticulate murmurs; then, the liquor being held <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> he drank, <b>and</b> with fresh vigour raised himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Eh!" [...] said Albert, {{dropping}} his look of pride, allowing <b>his</b> hand <b>to</b> fall from <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> <b>and</b> standing still before his companion {{with his mouth}} wide open.|$|R
60|$|Isaac Worthington {{clutched}} {{the table and}} started from his chair. He grew white <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> with anger, <b>and</b> yet {{he knew that he}} must control himself.|$|R
