5|$|A {{study of}} isotope data of La Brea dire wolf fossils dated 10,000YBP {{provides}} {{evidence that the}} horse was an important prey species at the time, and that sloth, mastodon, bison, and camel were less common in the dire wolf diet. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> the dire wolf was not a prey specialist, and {{at the close of}} the late Pleistocene before its extinction it was hunting or scavenging the most available herbivores.|$|E

This {{was the first}} instance of a non-native marine species being found in the Aleutian Islands. In 2009, they were discovered to have spread into British Columbia, Canada. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> C.mutica have completely expanded up the entire west coast of North America.|$|E
5|$|F. rubiginosa is {{exclusively}} pollinated in {{a symbiotic}} relationship with Pleistodontes imperialis, a species of fig wasp. Biologist Eleanor Haine and colleagues analysed the DNA of the wasp across the fig's range and determined four cryptic lineages forming what they term the P. imperialis species complex. They diverge {{to a greater degree}} than some distinct wasp species, yet form a monophyletic group; <b>this</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> the wasp lineages have split without a change of host.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{examination}} of daily moods in women with measuring ovarian hormones may indicate a less powerful connection. In comparison to levels of stress or physical health, the ovarian hormones had less of an impact on overall mood. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> while changes of ovarian hormones may influence mood, on a day-to-day level it does not influence mood more than other stressors do.|$|E
5|$|S-type (silicate-rich) asteroids {{are more}} common toward the inner region of the belt, within 2.5 AU of the Sun. The spectra of their {{surfaces}} reveal the presence of silicates and some metal, but no significant carbonaceous compounds. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> their materials have been significantly modified from their primordial composition, probably through melting and reformation.

5|$|Between the two buffer regions {{there is}} an end-point, or {{equivalence}} point, at about pH 3. This end-point is not sharp and is typical of a diprotic acid whose buffer regions overlap by a small amount: pKa2 − pKa1 is about three in this example. (If the difference in pK values were about two or less, the end-point would not be noticeable.) The second end-point begins at about pH  6.3 and is sharp. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> all the protons have been removed. When this is so, the solution is not buffered and the pH rises steeply on addition of {{a small amount of}} strong base. However, the pH does not continue to rise indefinitely. A new buffer region begins at about pH 11 (pKw − 3), which is where self-ionization of water becomes important.|$|E
5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{known what}} {{specific}} agent in the body brings about the allergic reaction to the radiation. When patients with SU were injected with an irradiated autologous serum, many developed urticaria within the area of injection. When {{people who did not}} have SU were injected, they did not demonstrate similar symptoms. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> the reaction is only a characteristic of the patients with solar urticaria and that it is not phototoxic. It is possible that this photoallergen is located on the binding sites of IgE that are found on the surface of mast cells. The photoallergen is believed to begin its configuration through the absorption of radiation by a chromophore. The molecule, because of the radiation, is transformed resulting in the formation of a new photoallergen.|$|E

5|$|Modulation {{of neural}} {{responses}} may correlate with phenomenal experiences. In {{contrast to the}} raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with {{an important aspect of}} consciousness: namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity (brightness, contrast). In the research group of Danko Nikolić {{it has been shown that}} some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony. An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that,</b> in the primary visual areas, changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualia—at least for some type of qualia.|$|E
5|$|Ploughshare, triangular-shaped: Triangular-shaped stone ploughshares {{are found}} at the sites of Majiabang culture dated to 3500 BC around Lake Tai. Ploughshares have also been {{discovered}} at the nearby Liangzhu and Maqiao sites roughly dated to the same period. David R. Harris says <b>this</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> more intensive cultivation in fixed, probably bunded, fields had developed by this time. According to Mu Yongkang and Song Zhaolin's classification and methods of use, the triangular plough assumed many kinds and were the departure from the Hemudu and Luojiajiao spade, with the Songze small plough in mid-process. The post-Liangzhu ploughs used draft animals.|$|E
5|$|The dacite volcanics {{composing}} Mount Fee contain brown {{volcanic glass}} {{as much as}} 70% and vesicular textures as much as 15%. About 25% of the volcanics contain crystal content, including plagioclase, hornblende, orthopyroxene, orthoclase and sporadic quartz. The orthoclase crystals are interpreted to represent rock fragments that became enveloped during hardening of the dacitic lavas. A portion of the southwestern flank of Mount Fee comprises no volcanic glass, but rather composed of an abnormal cryptocrystalline matrix. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> it might have developed {{as part of a}} subvolcanic intrusion.|$|E

5|$|The {{effect of}} {{population}} density on sexual selection for convict cichlids has been studied. When nest density was greater, the females {{tended to be}} larger, which is more accurately explained by density-dependent mate preference and mating competition, as opposed to predation and resource competition. Moreover, as the two nest density regimes were compared, with one high and one low, {{there was no significant}} difference in brood survival between the two; however, the convict cichlids did prefer to breed farther away from each other, not in close proximity. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> there are some other costs with breeding in an environment with high population density, an example being energy loss because of the resulting increased aggression when guarding territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the {{presence}} of sclerotic rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. The hadrosaurid sense of hearing also appears to be strong. There is at least one example, in the related Corythosaurus, of a slender stapes (reptilian ear bone) in place, which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear, and the hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian's. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> the auditory portion of the inner ear was well-developed. If used as a noisemaker, the crest could also have provided recognizable differences for different species or sexes, because the differing layouts of the nasal passages corresponding to the different crest shapes would have produced intrinsically different sounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{radiocarbon}} dating of the skeletal remains from 56 Beringian wolves showed a continuous population from over 50,800 YBP until 12,500YBP, followed by one wolf dated at 7,600YBP. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> their population was in decline after 12,500YBP, although megafauna was still available {{in this region}} until 10,500YBP. The timing of this latter specimen {{is supported by the}} recovery of mammoth and horse DNA from sediments dated 10,500 YBP–7,600 YBP from the interior of Alaska. The timing for the extinction of horses in North America and the minimum population size for North American bison coincide with the extinction of an entire wolf haplogroup in North America, indicating that the disappearance of their prey caused the extinction of this wolf ecomorph. This resulted in a significant loss of phenotypic and genetic diversity within the species.|$|E
