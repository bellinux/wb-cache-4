25|$|Following {{his trip}} to Israel, he turned his {{attention}} to the United States, arriving in Manhattan on September 17, 1929 (12 Elul 5689) on the French passenger liner France. Rabbi Schneersohn was greeted by some 600 people, with security provided by over 100 New York City police officers. “May the Almighty bless <b>this</b> <b>great</b> <b>country</b> that has been a refuge for our Jewish people,” he said at his arrival. The purpose of his visit was to assess the educational and religious state of American Jewry, and raise awareness of the plight of Soviet Jews. Hailed as “one of the greatest Jews of our age,” he was honored at an October 28 banquet in Manhattan by Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Jewish leaders.|$|E

[...] Saint-Gaudens was also interviewed, and as author Moran put it, [...] "injudiciously ranted": [...] "This is inept; this looks {{like it had been}} designed by a young lady of sixteen, a miss who had taken only a few lessons in modeling. It is beneath criticism... There are hundreds of artists in this country, any of whom, {{with the aid of a}} designer, could have made a very respectable coin, which this is not." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{the area}} that is now Garfield was first {{developed}} in 1873, it was known as East Passaic. In 1881, the community's name was changed to Garfield in honor of President of the United States James Garfield. There are two explanations given for the circumstances behind the renaming. According to one, shortly after Garfield {{was elected to the}} presidency the founder of East Passaic said, [...] "tell everyone...don't speak of East Passaic anymore; call it 'Garfield' after the man who will lead <b>this</b> <b>great</b> <b>country</b> to prosperity." [...] Seven months later, President Garfield was assassinated but his name remained with the community. The second theory holds that after Garfield's death in 1881, a new train station was named in his honor, which in turn led to the surrounding area becoming associated with his name as well.|$|E
2500|$|Consider this Canadian {{country during}} {{the early history of}} Montreal when the land was in its wild, uncultivated and natural condition. The soil was unproductive, rocky and almost uninhabitable—vast forests {{stretching}} in every direction. What invisible power caused this great metropolis to spring up amid such savage and forbidding conditions? It was the human mind. Therefore, nature and the effect of nature’s laws were imperfect. The mind of man remedied and removed this imperfect condition, until now we behold a great city instead of a savage unbroken wilderness. Before the coming of Columbus America itself was a wild, uncultivated expanse of primeval forest, mountains and rivers—a very world of nature. Now it has become the world of man. It was dark, forbidding and savage; now it has become illumined with a great civilization and prosperity. Instead of forests, we behold productive farms, beautiful gardens and prolific orchards. Instead of thorns and useless vegetation, we find flowers, domestic animals and fields awaiting harvest. If the world of nature were perfect, the condition of <b>this</b> <b>great</b> <b>country</b> would have been left unchanged.|$|E

2500|$|The British {{ambassador}} Sir Horace Rumbold who met Papen {{in early}} January 1933 expressed [...] "the wonder of an observer that the destinies of <b>this</b> <b>great</b> <b>country</b> should have been, {{even for a}} short time, {{in the hands of}} such a lightweight", commenting that everything Papen had to say was superficial in the extreme and that Papen seemed incapable of critical thinking. Hindenburg told Papen [...] "personally and in strict confidence" [...] that he had his support in attempting to form a new government that would bring in Hitler. As it became increasingly obvious that Schleicher would be unsuccessful in his maneuvering to maintain his chancellorship that would not be defeated by a vote of no-confidence, Papen worked to undermine Schleicher. On 18 January, Papen had lunch at Ribbentrop's house with Hitler, Heinrich Himmler and Ernst Röhm where Hitler argued that because the Nazis had done well in a Lander election in Lippe on 15 January that it would be impossible for him to serve as Vice-Chancellor in another government headed by Papen. When Papen replied {{that he did not have}} enough influence with Hindenburg to have Hitler [...] appointed as Chancellor, and he would have to settle for being Vice-Chancellor, Hitler stated that he would stick to his [...] "all or nothing" [...] strategy even if it meant the ruin of the Nazi Party.|$|E
2500|$|On Friday, {{the debate}} and vote on the Quebec issue lasted {{about an hour and}} a half. The Resolutions Committee's motion was tabled by {{leadership}} contender, David Lewis. He led the charge against the Waffle, speaking from the floor, and surrounded by approximately 600 supporters, stated: [...] "You would be doing an immense disservice to the party and <b>this</b> <b>great</b> <b>country</b> if this convention binds itself to any resolution that questions the desire of the people to live in one united Canada." [...] Another leadership hopeful, Ed Broadbent, tried to bridge the two polarized factions, by attempting to introduce a compromise amendment to Lewis' motion that said: [...] "There should be no questioning of the fundamental right of Quebeckers to leave Confederation if the decision is democratically arrived by the people of Quebec." [...] His amendment garnered little support, and was rejected outright by a wide majority. In the end, the vast majority of the 1700 convention delegates supported the Lewis motion, with a show of hands. The motion backed a one-Canada stand, and really gave the party's establishment a free-hand on how to prepare a more detailed position for the up-coming federal election, since the motion also made the party's−establishment controlled−Federal Council responsible for producing that policy. After the Quebec wing's defeat on the Quebec motion, Laliberté refused to state whether they would leave the party, only suggesting that it would be dealt with at their June provincial convention.|$|E
