The full enjoyment of the conjugal embrace can be indulged in during coition. The husband would hardly be likely to know that it was being used, unless told by the wife. … It places conception entirely {{under the control of the}} wife, to whom it naturally belongs; for it is for her <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>at</b> what time and under what circumstances, she will become the mother, and the moral, religious, and physical instructress of offspring.|$|E
25|$|I want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>at</b> {{once that}} I frankly believe that Irving Berlin is the {{greatest}} songwriter that has ever lived.... His songs are exquisite cameos of perfection, and {{each one of them}} is as beautiful as its neighbor. Irving Berlin remains, I think, America's Schubert. But apart from his genuine talent for song-writing, Irving Berlin has had a greater influence upon American music than any other one man. It was Irving Berlin who was the very first to have created a real, inherent American music.... Irving Berlin was the first to free the American song from the nauseating sentimentality which had previously characterized it, and by introducing and perfecting ragtime he had actually given us the first germ of an American musical idiom; he had sown the first seeds of an American music.|$|E

500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the 24 April, in Hamburg for the press conference the following day, Trevor-Roper asked Heidemann for the name of his source: the journalist refused, and gave a different story of how the diaries had been acquired. Trevor-Roper was suspicious and questioned the reporter closely for over an hour. Heidemann accused the historian of acting [...] "exactly like an officer of the British army" [...] in 1945. At a subsequent dinner the historian was evasive when asked by Stern executives what he was going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>at</b> the announcement the following day.|$|E
500|$|I am {{ashamed to}} relate what Gallienus used often <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>at</b> this time, when such things were happening, as though jesting amid {{the ills of}} mankind. For when he was told of the revolt of Egypt, {{he is said to}} have exclaimed [...] "What! We cannot do without Egyptian linen!" [...] and when {{informed}} that Asia had been devastated both by the violence of nature and by the inroads of the Scythians, he said, [...] "What! We cannot do without saltpetre!" [...] and when Gaul was lost, he is reported to have laughed and remarked, [...] "Can the commonwealth be safe without Atrebatic cloaks?" [...] Thus, in short, with regard to all parts of the world, as he lost them, he would jest, as though seeming to have suffered the loss of some article of trifling service.|$|E
500|$|Critics also derided Benchley's writing. Time {{reviewer}} John Skow {{described the}} novel as [...] "cliché and crude literary calculation", where events [...] "refuse to take on life and momentum" [...] and the climax [...] "lacks only Queequeg's coffin to resemble a bath tub version of Moby-Dick." [...] Writing for The Village Voice, Donald Newlove declared that [...] "Jaws has rubber teeth for a plot. It's boring, pointless, listless; if there's a trite turn to make, Jaws will make that turn." [...] An article in The Listener criticized the plot, stating the [...] "novel only has bite, so <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>at</b> feed time," [...] and these scenes are [...] "naïve attempts at whipping along a flagging story-line." [...] Andrew Bergman of The New York Times Book Review felt that despite the book serving as [...] "fluid entertainment", [...] "passages of hollow portentousness creep in" [...] while poor scene [...] "connections [...] stark manipulations impair the narrative." ...|$|E

500|$|With the Peace of Amiens, Cooke briefly retired on half-pay {{before being}} {{recalled}} to the fleet at {{the outbreak of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral Sir William Young at Plymouth, but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of [...] on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve escaped from Toulon, beginning the Trafalgar Campaign, Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood. The squadron arrived off Cadiz on 9 June and Collingwood detached Bellerophon and three other ships to blockade Cartagena under Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Bickerton. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>at</b> this time that [...] "To be in a general engagement with Nelson would crown all my military ambition". Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards, Stuart Levine of Variety {{reviewed}} {{the performances of}} the three cast members nominated in the Outstanding Supporting Actress category. [...] "The ladies of Grey's Anatomy dominate the category, and it'd be far from a stretch <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>at</b> least two of those women rose to high dramatics last season", commented Levine, while praising Sandra Oh for her portrayal of Cristina Yang who endured a tumultuous seasoning relationship, seeing her trepidation at spending a life together with the man she loved. He regarded the appearances of Chandra Wilson as more subdued, though [...] "by no means less well-executed". He deemed Miranda Bailey a rock, being the most level-headed character on the show with a right thing to say in any situation. He expressed admiration towards Chandra Wilson, by describing her as being [...] "flashy and over the top", which he considers better than being consistently good. Considering Heigl's chances of winning the Emmy, Levine assessed of her performance, by remarking the slight difficulty she has in reaching each emotional state Izzie Stevens has to go through: [...] "Showrunner Shonda Rhimes {{puts a lot of}} pressure on Heigl to carry many intense storylines, and she's up to the challenge." [...] However, he also noted that Izzie's irrational actions during crisis situations may be bothering.|$|E

2500|$|Slash's {{friendship}} with GunsN'Roses frontman Axl Rose soured following his {{departure from the}} band.

Slash denied the accusations. In his 2007 autobiography he admitted to visiting Rose's home with the intention to settle a longstanding legal dispute and make peace with his former bandmate. He claims, however, {{that he did not}} speak with Rose and instead merely left a note. Slash maintains that he had not spoken with Rose in person since 1996.
