Alchemists subjected organic matter <b>to</b> <b>chemical</b> analysis and experimented liberally with both biological and mineral pharmacology. This {{was part of a larger}} transition in world views (the rise of the mechanical philosophy) that continued into the 17th century, as the traditional metaphor of nature as organism was replaced by the nature as machine metaphor.|$|E

5|$|Assuming a {{composition}} {{similar to that}} of Jupiter and that the planet's atmosphere is close <b>to</b> <b>chemical</b> equilibrium, it is predicted that 55 Cancri d is covered in a layer of water clouds: the planet's internal heat probably keeps it too warm to form the ammonia-based clouds that are typical of Jupiter. Its surface gravity is likely to be about 4 to 5 times stronger than Jupiter, or about 10 to 15 times that of Earth which is because the radius of the planet is unlikely to be much more than Jupiter's and is probably slightly smaller than Jupiter due to the high metal content in the parent star.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{its high}} mass, Gliese 876 c {{is likely to}} be a gas giant with no solid surface.

5|$|Biotechnology in {{the general}} sense has been an {{important}} part of biology since the late 19th century. With the industrialization of brewing and agriculture, chemists and biologists became aware of the great potential of human-controlled biological processes. In particular, fermentation proved a great boon <b>to</b> <b>chemical</b> industries. By the early 1970s, a wide range of biotechnologies were being developed, from drugs like penicillin and steroids to foods like Chlorella and single-cell protein to gasohol—as well as a wide range of hybrid high-yield crops and agricultural technologies, the basis for the Green Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Given the planet's high mass, it {{is likely}} that 47 Ursae Majoris b is a gas giant with no solid surface.

Due to its mass {{it is likely}} to have a surface gravity 68 times that of Earth. Assuming a composition similar to that of Jupiter and an environment close <b>to</b> <b>chemical</b> equilibrium, the upper atmosphere of the planet is expected to contain water clouds, as opposed to the ammonia clouds typical of Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|Individuals and {{organizations}} have been reviewing cadmium's bioinorganic aspects for its toxicity.

Because of its chemical resistance, zircon is also used in aggressive environments, such as moulds for molten metals.|$|E
40|$|The RIVM {{investigated}} the probable contribution of exposure <b>to</b> <b>chemicals</b> at the workplace {{as the cause}} of some ten diseases. This exploratory study was requested by of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment, and presents for the first time an integrated estimation of the burden of disease due to occupational exposure <b>to</b> <b>chemicals.</b> For nine investigated diseases the study resulted in a burden of disease of approximately 47, 000 DALYs, including about 1, 900 deaths, due <b>to</b> exposure <b>to</b> <b>chemicals</b> at the workplace. DALY stands for 'Disability Adjusted Life Years', in which premature death and years with disease are weighted counted up. The largest contributions are formed by mesothelioma, lung cancer, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The margin of uncertainty in the results is very large, mainly caused by the scarce and incomplete data, and amounts about a factor of 5. It was not possible to estimate the burden of disease due to reproductive disorders following occupational exposure <b>to</b> <b>chemicals.</b> However, results of recent research in this area indicate concern...|$|R

Worldwide, 30% of catalysts used for this process contain rhenium. The olefin metathesis is the other reaction for which rhenium is used as catalyst. Normally Re2O7 on alumina is used for this process. Rhenium catalysts are very resistant <b>to</b> <b>chemical</b> poisoning from nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus, and so are used in certain kinds of hydrogenation reactions.|$|E
