25|$|The Zen student's {{mastery of}} a given kōan is {{presented}} to the teacher in a private interview (referred to in Japanese as dokusan (独参), daisan (代参), or sanzen (参禅)). While there is no unique answer to a kōan, practitioners are expected to demonstrate {{their understanding of the}} kōan and of Zen through their responses. <b>The</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>may</b> approve or disapprove of the answer and guide the student in the right direction. The interaction with a Zen teacher is central in Zen, but makes Zen practice also vulnerable to misunderstanding and exploitation.|$|E
25|$|Generalization is the {{expansion}} of a student's performance ability beyond the initial conditions set for acquisition of a skill. Generalization can occur across people, places, and materials used for teaching. For example, once a skill is learned in one setting, with a particular instructor, and with specific materials, the skill is taught in more general settings with more variation from the initial acquisition phase. For example, if a student has successfully mastered learning colors at the table, <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>may</b> take the student around the house or his school and then generalize the skill in these more natural environments with other materials. Behavior analysts have spent considerable amount of time studying factors that lead to generalization.|$|E

The use of a 'Stop, Start Continue' format for student feedback has been shown to be highly effective at generating constructive feedback for course improvement.

60|$|When {{the time}} has arrived a subject is assigned, and small papers are {{distributed}} to the whole school, that all may write something concerning it. These are then read and commented on by the teacher, and are made the occasion of any remarks, which he may wish to make. The interest is strongly excited to hear the papers read, and the instruction which <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>may</b> give, produces a deeper effect, when engrafted thus, upon something which originates {{in the minds of}} the pupils.|$|E
60|$|Another mode of {{examining}} classes, {{which it is}} important to describe, consists in requiring written answers to the questions asked. The form and manner, in which this plan may be adopted, is various. The class may bring their slates to the recitation, and <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>may</b> propose questions successively, the answers to which all the class may write, numbering them carefully. After a dozen answers are written, <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>may</b> call, at random, for them; or he may repeat a question, and ask each pupil to read the answer he had written; or he may examine the slates. Perhaps this method may be very successfully employed in reviews, by dictating to the class, a list of questions, relating to the ground they have gone over, for a week, and to which they are to prepare answers, written out at length, and to be brought in at the next exercise. This method may be made more formal still, by requiring a class to write a full and regular abstract of all they have learned, during a specified time. The practice of thus reducing to writing what has been learned, will be attended with many advantages, so obvious that they need not be described.|$|E
60|$|Unless {{the boys}} are very {{different}} from any I have ever met with, they will be pleased with the duty thus assigned them. They will learn system and regularity by being taught to perform this simple duty in a proper manner. After a week, <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>may</b> consider their term of service as having expired, and thanking them, in public for the assistance they have rendered him, he may ask the scholars, if they are willing to continue the plan, and if the vote is in favor of it, as it unquestionably would be, each boy probably hoping that he should be appointed to the office, <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>may</b> nominate four others, including perhaps upon the list, some boy popular among his companions, but whom he has suspected to be not very friendly to himself or the school. I think the most scrupulous politician would not object to securing influence, by conferring office in such a case. If any difficulties arise from the operation of such a measure, it can easily be dropped, or modified. If it is successful, it may be continued, and the principle extended, till it very considerably modifies all the arrangements, and the whole management of the school.|$|E

50|$|There {{are roughly}} 80 staff members at Buckley Park College, {{including}} teachers, canteen volunteers, office {{members and the}} staff involved in running the school and caring for students. The current principal of the school is Nathan Chisholm. The current vice-principals of the school are Geoff Currie and Richard Jones. They and Chisholm have their own private offices to manage the school, situated in 'B Block'. The staff are mainly based around 'B Block', where each teacher {{has his or her}} private compartment in their staffroom. There are four staffrooms holding at least 15 teachers each along with a social staffroom where <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>may</b> gather at break times.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>may</b> now, if be pleases, {{after the}} {{majority}} of the class have gone, hear the reasons of those who were unprepared, and look for the errors of those whose work was incorrect; but it is better to spend as little time as possible, in such a way. If a scholar is not prepared, it is not of much consequence, whether it is because he forgot his book, or mistook the lesson; or if it is ascertained that his answer is incorrect, it is, ordinarily, a mere waste of time, to search for the particular error.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{it will be}} {{seen that}} there may be cases where <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>may</b> make {{arrangements}} for separating his scholars, on an open and distinct understanding with them in respect to the cause of it. We have given these cases not that exactly such ones will be very likely to occur, or that when they do, the teacher is to manage them in exactly the way here described, but to exhibit more clearly to the reader than could be done by any general description, the spirit and tone which a teacher ought to assume towards his pupils. We wished to exhibit this in contrast with the harsh and impatient manner, which teachers too often assume in such a case;--as follows.|$|E
60|$|These two objects are, it is plain, entirely distinct. Under the latter, is {{included}} all the explanation, and assistance, and additional information, which <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>may</b> give his pupils, and, under the former, such {{an examination of}} individuals, as is necessary to secure their careful attention to their lessons. It is unsafe to neglect either of these points. If the class meetings are mere recitations, they soon become dull and mechanical: the pupils generally take little interest in their studies, and imbibe no literary spirit. Their intellectual progress will, accordingly, suddenly cease, the moment they leave school, and cease to {{be called upon to}} recite lessons. On the other hand, if instruction is all that is aimed at, and recitation, (by which I mean, as above explained, such an examination of individuals as is necessary to ascertain that they have faithfully performed the tasks assigned,) is neglected, the exercise soon becomes {{not much more than a}} lecture, to which those, and those only, will attend, who please.|$|E
