5|$|Kurt and Blaine {{attend a}} party hosted by New Directions co-captain Rachel Berry (Lea Michele). <b>The</b> <b>attendees</b> play spin the bottle, {{which results in}} Rachel and Blaine kissing. In the aftermath, Blaine wonders whether he might be bisexual, and goes {{on a date with}} Rachel. When she kisses him again while they are both sober, he concludes that he is indeed gay, which {{relieves}} Kurt.|$|E
5|$|Planché's {{expertise}} in historical dress {{was not only}} of interest to his fellow antiquarians. During her reign Queen Victoria held a number of bals costumés at which <b>the</b> <b>attendees</b> had to wear costume of a specified era. Planché's advice was much in demand in the periods leading up to these balls as invited guests had costumes made.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{number of}} bishops, archbishops, and abbots who {{attended}} is unknown. Estimates range from 1,100 to 400, {{with the lower}} number being much more likely. <b>The</b> <b>attendees</b> were from what were later the countries of France, Germany, England, and Spain, and {{in keeping with the}} times, would have included not just the prelates who were summoned, but also their servants and officials, making the true number of people in Reims impossible to know.|$|E
40|$|This session {{will allow}} {{participants}} to: 1) Understand national and Jefferson specific safety {{data and the}} implications concerning patient safety. - <b>The</b> <b>attendee</b> {{will be able to}} identify vulnerabilities and formulate approaches to mitigate them. 2) Describe the goal of patient safety. – <b>The</b> <b>attendee</b> will be able to describe the rationale for selecting the goal of patient safety being the prevention of harm rather than simply identifying the elimination of errors. 3) Describe the importance of close calls/near misses in identifying patient safety vulnerabilities. – <b>The</b> <b>attendee</b> will be able to describe the superior utility to identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities identified through close call reporting rather than just responding to adverse events when they occur. 4) Identify the value of a non-punitive approach to problem identification and resolution. – <b>The</b> <b>attendee</b> will be able to describe how the removal of barriers to reporting will enhance the effectiveness of a patient safety program. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>attendee</b> will be able to describe impediments to reporting such as fear, shame, and administrative punishment as well as measures to ameliorate the impact of these impediments. 5) Describe the value of clearly defining what activities are blameworthy. - <b>The</b> <b>attendee</b> will be able to describe the essential elements of defining what constitutes a blameworthy action. Specific criteria include criminal acts, purposely unsafe acts, or acts committed {{under the influence of alcohol}} or illicit substances. 6) Describe the role that leadership at all levels plays in the institution of an effective patient safety program. - Specific examples of how leadership can demonstrate support to the organization will be covered. Examples include the requirement that top leadership must personally review and approve all root cause analyses and their corresponding corrective actions. 7) Identify strategies for prioritizing and ameliorating patient safety vulnerabilities. – <b>The</b> <b>attendee</b> will be able to describe the advantage of a risk based approach to prioritization rather than a more traditional one that only considers the severity of an event rather than also considering the probability of occurrence. 8) Understand the role of culture in providing safe and high quality patient care. - <b>The</b> <b>attendee</b> will be able to describe techniques and tools to enhance teamwork and improve safety culture in their immediate work environment.

5|$|At a {{scheduled}} layover in Chicago, they disembarked {{only long enough}} for breakfast and to answer some brief media questions before the train resumed its route. In Omaha, Nebraska, the King was {{the guest of honor}} at a reception held in the home of Judge James M. Woolworth. Most of <b>the</b> <b>attendees</b> were friends of the judge's daughter, who had met the King on a vacation in Hawaii. Although Kalākaua had claimed exhaustion from his world trip, he nevertheless danced the whole night with the women guests. Claus and Mrs. Spreckels joined the group at Ogden, Utah.|$|E
5|$|During {{their stay}} in mosques, these jamaats conduct a daily gasht, which {{involves}} visiting local neighbourhoods, preferably {{with the help}} of a guide. They invite people to attend the Maghrib prayer at their mosque and those who attend are delivered a sermon after the prayers, which essentially outlines the Six Principles. They urge <b>the</b> <b>attendees</b> to spend time in tabligh for self reformation and the propagation of Islam. Also the regular activities like eating, sleeping etc. are also carried out in the mosques.|$|E
40|$|Being a Windchill {{administrator}} {{often requires}} performing simple yet repetitive tasks on large sets of objects. These can include renaming, deleting, checking in, undoing checkout, and much more. This {{is especially true}} during a migration. Fortunately, PTC has provided {{a simple way to}} dynamically interact with Windchill using Info*Engine. This presentation will describe how to create simple Info*Engine tasks capable of saving Windchill 10. 0 administrators hours of tedious work.

5|$|In August and September 1940 the Congress became {{split between}} Ansar and Khatmiyya supporters. At first the Ansar were dominant, but they lost this {{position}} {{by the end}} of 1942. Many of Abd al-Rahman's supporters saw him as a source of financial backing and admired his advocacy of an independent Sudan, but did not follow him as a religious leader and were not members of the Ansar movement. By the end of 1942 the government had decided the Congress had no political value. The Mahdists had split into rival camps, other factions had emerged, and <b>the</b> <b>attendees</b> {{at the annual meeting of}} the Congress included artisans, merchants and illiterates.|$|E
5|$|In March 1888, while Mansfield's {{company was}} touring, Daniel E. Bandmann staged a {{competing}} production {{with the same}} name at Niblo's Garden. Bandmann's opening night (March 12) coincided with the Great Blizzard of 1888, and only five theatergoers braved the storm. One of <b>the</b> <b>attendees</b> was Sullivan, who was checking his competition. Bandmann's production inspired a letter from Stevenson to the New York Sun saying that only the Mansfield version was authorized and paying him royalties.|$|E
5|$|Newcastle High School student Jason Robertson's 16th {{birthday}} party {{was held on}} 3November 1989 at the North Stockton Surf Club, a formerly abandoned building which the Stockton Lions Club had taken over four years prior, leasing it for various functions. Police estimated that about 60 people had attended the party, though figures as high as 100 were reported in the media. Most of <b>the</b> <b>attendees</b> were Year Ten students from Newcastle High School, though two 10-year-olds were seen at the party at one point. Many were drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana, and some were having sex.|$|E

5|$|On 7 May, Livingstone {{called a}} caucus of his supporters; announcing his intent to {{challenge}} McIntosh's leadership, he invited those assembled {{to stand for}} other GLC posts. The meeting ended at 4:45pm having agreed on a full slate of candidates. At 5 o'clock, McIntosh held a GLC Labour meeting; <b>the</b> <b>attendees</b> called an immediate leadership election, in which Livingstone defeated him by 30 votes to 20. The entire left caucus slate was then elected. The next day, a leftist coup deposed Sir Ashley Bramall on the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA), replacing him with Bryn Davies; the left group now controlled both the GLC and the ILEA.|$|E
5|$|Representatives from 108 of Kentucky's 120 {{counties}} {{attended the}} convention. Among <b>the</b> <b>attendees</b> were {{the editors of}} the Lexington Herald, Louisville Evening Post, and Louisville Dispatch, former congressman Owens, former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives Harvey Myers, Jr., and political bosses William Mackoy, John Whallen, and Theodore Hallam. The convention nominated an entire slate of candidates for state office, with former governor Brown at the head. They also put forward a platform condemning the Music Hall Convention, the Goebel Election Law, and the presidential administration of William McKinley.|$|E
5|$|When the 2013 festival {{began in}} Park City, Utah, the secrecy {{about the movie}} continued. The festival's website only {{identified}} the setting as a theme park. Nan Chalat-Noaker, critic for the Park Record, recalls that the festival and even the film's publicist were unwilling to share further details about the film, but strongly urged critics to see it. In her review, she declined to identify {{the setting of the}} film by name, although she dropped broad hints, out of fear it would alert Disney's lawyers. The premiere, on the festival's first night, was not fully attended; when word got out to <b>the</b> <b>attendees,</b> all the other shows were effectively sold out.|$|E

40|$|Do {{you have}} {{workflows}} with many manual tasks that slow down your business? Or, do you scale back workflows {{because there are}} simply too many manual tasks? Basic workflow robots can automate some common tasks, but not everything. This presentation will show how advanced robots called "expression robots" {{can be set up}} to perform everything from simple tasks such as: moving, creating folders, renaming, changing or creating an attribute, and revising, to more complex tasks like: creating a pdf, or even launching a session of Creo Parametric and performing a specific modeling task. Expression robots are able to utilize the Java API and Info*Engine to do almost anything you can imagine! Best of all, these tools are supported by PTC and will work with later releases of Windchill. Limited knowledge of Java, Info*Engine, and XML are required. <b>The</b> <b>attendee</b> will learn what task expression robots are capable of performing. <b>The</b> <b>attendee</b> will learn what is involved in setting up an expression robot. <b>The</b> <b>attendee</b> will gain a basic understanding of simple Info*Engine task...|$|R
50|$|At the spa resort, a spa worker {{tells them}} that sex trade workers must {{come through the}} back door. Ginko says they are dancers, not {{strippers}} or prostitutes.

Lena wins a cash prize, and Ginko is reluctantly forced to become a human sushi bar. Lena ends up unintentionally sleeping with <b>the</b> lead spa <b>attendee</b> after getting drunk.|$|R
5|$|At 2pm {{on the day}} of announcement, a {{crowd of}} about 100 journalists, supporters, and friends who had {{gathered}} outside the main entrance to the Beijing housing estate where the Lius resided were denied entry. The South China Morning Post reported that policemen stationed inside their apartment {{at the time of the}} announcement prevented Liu Xia from meeting with journalists and other well-wishers. It was not immediately clear whether Liu Xiaobo was aware of the award. By that time, Liu Xia said she had been told she would be taken to Liaoning to see her husband in prison. Meetings and gatherings to celebrate in several cities were prevented or abruptly broken up by police; one such celebration dinner in Beijing, attended by 20 people, was broken up by police, and <b>the</b> <b>attendees</b> were detained.|$|E
5|$|Back at the office, a few outsiders attend Michael's party. One of <b>the</b> <b>attendees</b> (Tate Hanyok) strikes up a {{conversation}} with Dwight (Rainn Wilson), who tries to sell her paper; Dwight becomes angry when she tells him she already has a paper supplier. Another attendee named Lynne (Lisa K. Wyatt) converses with Kevin (Brian Baumgartner), who is still somewhat depressed over his breakup with his fiancée Stacy and walks away when he admits it was she who broke it off. Kevin returns later to apologize to Lynne and admits he gets nervous talking to pretty girls; Lynne is flattered and gives Kevin her e-mail address. Afterwards, Michael is disappointed the woman who lost her glove does not show up and tells the employees they can go home early, but the empathetic staff decide to stay and later encourage Michael to leave with them.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s Abd al-Rahman was a {{respected}} {{religious and political}} leader. In 1921 he held a meeting at his home where <b>the</b> <b>attendees</b> signed two documents that laid out the Mahdist objectives. These were for Sudan to be ruled by Britain rather than Egypt, and for Sudan to eventually achieve self-government. In the early 1920s, between 5,000 and 15,000 pilgrims were coming to Aba Island each year to celebrate Ramadan. Many of them identified Abd al-Rahman with Isa, the prophet Jesus, and assumed that he would drive the Christian colonists out of Sudan. The British found that Abd al-Rahman was in correspondence with agents and leaders in Nigeria and Cameroon, predicting the eventual victory of the Mahdists over the Christians. They blamed him for unrest in these colonies. After pilgrims from West Africa held mass demonstrations on Aba Island in 1924, Abd al-Rahman was told {{to put a stop}} to the pilgrimages.|$|E
50|$|Of {{this ancient}} diocese is known only one bishop, Emiliano, {{who was among}} <b>the</b> <b>attendee</b> at <b>the</b> Second Council of Constantinople in 553. Today Antipirgo survives as a titular bishopric, and the seat is vacant since March 6, 1969.|$|R

40|$|In {{sustainable}} tourism planning {{it is essential}} to understand the type of tourist attending and determine the temporal sustainability or longevity of pop-culture festivals, especially those focused around film and television. Mount Airy, North Carolina, was physically transformed in the 1980 s to mirror Mayberry, the fictional town of television's The Andy Griffith Show and is currently home to the Mayberry Days Festival. This thesis examines the Mayberry Days Festival to develop a typology of festival visitors and the influence of The Andy Griffith Show on <b>the</b> <b>attendee's</b> motivations. Online survey invitation cards were distributed during the 2010 Mayberry Days Festival in order to gather data on the socio-demographic characteristics, motivations, perceptions, and economic impact of <b>the</b> <b>attendee.</b> Additionally, a framework was developed to identify and analyze the different tourist profiles based on <b>the</b> <b>attendee's</b> behaviors and characteristics to comprehend how sustainable the Mayberry Days Festival will be for Mount Airy in the future. Results suggest that visitors are drawn to Mount Airy {{for a variety of reasons}} and that The Andy Griffith Show is not necessarily the main motivator. Long term success of Mount Airy tourism is perhaps linked to building upon it's small town nostalgic image which can be independent of it's association of television.   M. S...|$|R
5|$|Gilbert had {{previously}} been investigated by Eugene at Paris in April 1147, but this hearing came to nothing for two reasons. One was that Gilbert's opponents were not unified in what they opposed in Gilbert's teachings. The second reason was {{that no one had}} a copy of the treatise on Boethius by Gilbert that was in dispute. Prior to the second hearing at Reims, Bernard of Clairvaux, who was opposed to Gilbert's teachings, held a private meeting with a number of <b>the</b> <b>attendees,</b> where Bernard attempted to pressure them to condemn Gilbert. This offended the various cardinals in attendance, who then proceeded to insist that they were the only persons who could judge the case.|$|E
5|$|HMAS Waller, {{the third}} of the RAN's Collins-class {{submarines}} to enter service, was commissioned on 10July 1999. <b>The</b> <b>attendees</b> included John Waller, Michael Waller's wife, and surviving crewmen of HMAS Perth. On 13March 2010, a memorial to Waller was unveiled in his home town of Benalla. In April 2011, {{he was one of}} thirteen servicemen—eleven sailors and two soldiers, including Teddy Sheean, Robert Rankin, and John Simpson Kirkpatrick—named by the Australian government for consideration as possible recipients of the Victoria Cross for extreme valour in combat, under a review by the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal; no RAN member had ever been awarded the decoration. Concluding its investigations in February 2013, the tribunal recommended that no further award be made to any of the thirteen servicemen, but that the name Waller (among others) should continue to be used for RAN ships after the current bearer was decommissioned.|$|E
5|$|In 1148, a Council of Reims {{was called}} by Pope Eugene III to {{consider}} a number of regulations, or canons, for the Church, {{as well as to}} debate some other issues. Originally the summons for the council went out in October 1147 and {{it was supposed to be}} held in Trier, which is now in Germany, but conditions in Trier were such that it was moved to Reims, in France, for February 1148. A number of the summoned bishops and other church officials did not attend and Eugene suspended many of the non-attendees, excepting the Italian ecclesiastics, who were excused. The council lasted 11 days, and convened on 21 March 1148. From 400 to 1100 ecclesiastics are considered to have attended, although this number does not include the various servants and officials of <b>the</b> <b>attendees,</b> who would have swelled the numbers.|$|E
