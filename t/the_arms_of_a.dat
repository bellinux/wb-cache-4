5|$|Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was downed in the {{end zone}} for a touchback, and Indiana's offense started work at its 10-yard line after a Hoosier penalty. On the first play of Indiana's drive, Dittoe was sacked and fumbled the ball, which rolled into <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Virginia Tech defender. The Hokie offense quickly {{returned}} to the field and Tech's Tommy Edwards scored on the first play after being set up at the Indiana five-yard line after the turnover. The extra point gave Tech a 4213 lead with 9:21 remaining.|$|E

5|$|In {{the western}} churches, the mitre was placed above the shield of all persons who were {{entitled}} to wear the mitre, including abbots. It substituted for the helmet of military arms, but also appeared as a crest placed atop a helmet, as was common in German heraldry. In the Anglican Churches, the mitre is still placed above the arms of bishops and not an ecclesiastical hat. In the Roman Catholic Church, {{the use of the}} mitre above the shield on the personal arms of clergy was suppressed in 1969, and is now found only on some corporate arms, like those of dioceses. Previously, the mitre was often included under the hat, and even in <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cardinal, the mitre was not entirely displaced.|$|E
5|$|The current Basque {{coat of arms}} (Spanish: Escudo del País Vasco, Basque: Euskal autonomi erkidegoaren armarria) is the {{official}} coat of arms of the Basque Country, Autonomous community of Spain. It consists of a party per cross representing the three historical territories of Álava, Gipuzkoa and Biscay, {{as well as a}} fourth, void quarter. The arms are ringed by a regal wreath of oak leaves, symbolic of the Gernikako Arbola. The fourth quarter constituted since the late 19th century the linked chains of Navarre; however, following a legal suit by the Navarre Government claiming that the usage of <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> region on the flag of another was illegal, the Constitutional Court of Spain ordered the removal of the chains of Navarre in a judgement of 1986.|$|E
5|$|Each of Sweden's 21 {{counties}} (län), 25 provinces (landskap) and 290 municipalities (kommun) {{has its own}} coat of arms. The Instrument of Government (1634) {{introduced the}} modern counties of Sweden, superseding the 25 medieval provinces. Although many of these counties {{have been the subject}} of more recent reforms, many of them occupy broadly similar regions. (See comparative maps at Counties of Sweden.) Most of the counties that have remained largely intact (Dalarna, Gotland, Skåne, Södermanland, Uppsala, Värmland, etc.) retain the respective province's coat of arms, while the redistricting of other lands has been reflected heraldically (e.g. the newly created Gävleborgs län, occupying parts of Hälsingland and Gästrikland, bears their arms quarterly). By royal decree on 18 January 1884, King Oscar II granted all provinces the rights to the rank of duchy and to display their arms with a ducal coronet. While more exhaustive lists can be found elsewhere, this article only discusses <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few of these regions, selected for their heraldic notability. The arms of Gotland, Västerbotten, Uppland, Södermanland, Skåne and Lappland will be considered here in further detail.|$|E

5|$|The German team {{started the}} second half in a more {{positive}} mood with Jancker forcing a save from Schmeichel in the first minute of the restart. Basler was proving to be Bayern's most dangerous player, first firing a 30-yard shot towards goal and then setting up a header for Markus Babbel, who missed the ball entirely. United put together an attack when, after a healthy period of possession, Giggs sent in a cross towards Jesper Blomqvist who could only knock the ball over the bar after a desperate stretch. Another chance for Basler prompted Alex Ferguson to bring on striker Teddy Sheringham. Ottmar Hitzfeld responded with a substitution of his own, bringing on Mehmet Scholl, who immediately set up Stefan Effenberg for a long-range shot which went narrowly wide. Schmeichel kept his side in the game when tipping another Effenberg shot over the bar after 75 minutes. Scholl then almost scored from a delicate 20-yard chip after a run from Basler, but the ball bounced back off the post and into <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relieved Schmeichel. With the game seemingly drifting away from the English side, Ferguson introduced striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær with 10 minutes remaining. The substitute immediately forced Kahn into a diving save with a header; it was the closest United had come to scoring all game. A minute later, Bayern missed a chance to secure the trophy when an overhead kick from Jancker came off the crossbar. As the game crept into the last five minutes, United's two substitutes forced Kahn into more saves, firstly through a Sheringham volley and then from another Solskjær header.|$|E

25|$|Arms of such councils may {{feature the}} {{historical}} ecclesiastical {{arms of a}} local church, cathedral or diocese, such as the arms of Watford Borough Council which feature {{the arms of the}} Diocese of St. Albans.

Another example is the use of the rose, the symbol of the Virgin Mary.
