Due to the epitaxial {{nature of the}} interface, the lattice strain induced by ferroelectric poling or the converse piezoelectric effect in the PMN-PT substrate is effectively transferred to the LSCO film and thus reduces the tensile strain of the film, giving rise to {{a decrease in the}} resistivity of the LSCO film. We discuss these strain effects {{within the framework of the}} spin state transition of Co³⁺ ions and modification of the electronic bandwidth that is relevant to the induced strain. By simultaneously measuring the strain and the resistivity, quantitative relationship between the resistivity and the strain was established for the LSCO film. Both theoretical calculation and experimental results demonstrate that the ferroelectric field effect at room temperature in the LSCO/PMN-PT field-effect transistor is minor and could be neglected. Nevertheless, with decreasing temperature, the ferroelectric field effect competes with the strain effect and plays a more and more important role in influencing the electronic transport properties of the LSCO film, which we interpreted as due to the localization of charge carriers at low temperature.

HYBRID COMPOSITE MATERIALS, RESULT OF THE PARTIAL SUBSTITUTION OF THE FIBERS MENTIONED ABOVE, WERE ALSO STUDIED. GENERALLY, THE ADDITION OF A SMALL QUANTITY OF COATED ASBESTOS FIBERS INCREASES THE <b>TENSIL</b> MODULUS. FURTHERMORE THIS PHENOMENON IS POSITIVELY INFLUENCED BY THE INCREASE OF THE POLYAMIDE LAYER. AS FAR AS THE CARBON FIBERS COMPOSITE MATERIALS ARE CONCERNED, IT IS OBSERVED THAT THE TENSILE PROPERTIES AND THE I. L. S. S. ARE NOT INFLUENCED BY THE COATING. ON THE CONTRARY, FLEXRUAL PROPERTIES ARE CONSIDERABLY DECREASED BUT IMPACT STRENGTH IS ENHANCED EVEN AT LOW POLYAMIDE CONTENTS. FINALLY, THE RESULTS OF THE IMMERSION OF THE MATERIALS INTO WATER SHOW THAT THE DIFFUSION IS INFLUENCED BY MECHANISMS SUCH AS MATRIX PLASTICIZATION AND HYDROLYSIS OF THE POLYAMIDE LAYER. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} Griffith {{criterion for}} a fractal ensemble of cracks {{is applied to}} the interpretation of Acoustic Emission (AE) statistics during the compressional deformation of intact and artificially pre-cut rock specimens in the laboratory. A mean energy release rate per unit crack surface area (G) is recovered from the observed A E event rate N and the seismic b value, by calculating an inferred mean crack length (c) and measuring the differential stress a for a range of experimental conditions. Temporal variations in (G) under compressive deformation show very similar trends to those predicted by a synoptic model determined by direct extrapolation from observations of subcritical crack growth under tension. (In the tensile case, deformation is centred on a dominant macrocrack and the stress intensity K, which scales as the square root of G, is the relevant measured variable.) The three independent variables measured during the tests (a, N, b) are reduced to points that map out a path through a 3 -D phase space ((G), N, b), which depends on the material type and the experimental conditions. 2 -D slices through this phase space [((G), N), ((G), b) ] are compared with results from the <b>tensil...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Mechanical <b>tensil</b> and {{relaxation}} tests {{were performed to}} {{examine the effect of}} nanoclay content and its dispersion on viscoelastic behavior of nanocomposites. Master-batch of PA 6 /Clay was prepared via melt mixing. Doing sensitivity analysis on the results of the tensile tests with regarding to cross head speed revealed that in spite of monotonically increase in elasticity modulus and yield stress with nanoclay weight fraction increase, by exfoliation of nano clay sensitivity to strain rate will decrease intensively, this effect in intercalated specimen is not as much as the exfoliated ones. Also, it seems that this degree for higher quantities of nanoclay approaches to a distinct limit. The results of the Analysis of stress-relaxation test by generalized Maxwell model indicated that existence of nanoclay on polymer matrix has an effect on both viscosity and elasticity behaviors of matrix. The effect of exfoliation of clay on elastic property is much more than its effect on viscosity behavior. When the layers are exfoliated, by increasing weight fraction of clay in formulation, time constants of Maxwell model leads to a decrease, while its elastic constants increase. Intercalation of clay more affected viscose behavior. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Within {{construction}} industry developing rapidly in domestic, long span buildings and high-rise buildings emerge in endlessly. Steel tubular structures are increasingly widely used for its unique advantages. Thanks to the situation, flange-plate connections {{become more and}} more popular as an important solution of splicing steel tubular structures. The connections provide easy and fast installation, nice shape, simple constitution for tubular structures without the need for welding. Typical loading situations include axial tension force and moment for flange-plate connections. The loading capacity under axial tension was studied by many scholars. Unfortunately, study on flexural capacity of flange-plate connections is limited. This situation limits the generalization of the nice connections. As {{can be seen from the}} review on flange-plate connections, there is no doubt that doing research on flexural capacity of flange-plate connections is necessary. Previous studies on axial loading capacity of flange-plate connections can provide helpful options of research for this work. One of the options is to observe the prying forces caused by flange-plates ’ deformation, for prying is an important influencing factor on axial loading capacity of flange-plate connections which can reduce capacity of the connection. It is same as axial loading case that prying forces exists in the <b>tensil...</b>|$|E
40|$|For special {{strains of}} mineralic layers in the {{disposal}} sites' sealing system, the permeability and the stress deformation behaviour of a composite construction material made of short fiber reinforcements and mineralic sealing materials {{have been investigated}} in element tests. Therefore we produced three kinds of soil (clay, loam, clay powdered sand) with all together eight different reinforcement elements with reinforcement percentages of 0, 5 % up to 3 % max. Those were examined in the Proctor-, uniaxial pressure-, triaxial-, direct shear-, <b>tensil</b> splitting- and compression tests, {{as well as in}} permeability tests in isotropic and anisotropic stress conditions with optimal and reduced water content. After this, it was possible to produce plastic fiber reinforced cohesive and mixed grained soils up to 1, 5 % reinforcement percentage and glass fiber reinforced soils up to 3 %. Thus, compared to unreinforced soils, considerably higher drained and undrained strengths were reached without significantly disturbing the permeability. Whereas fiber reinforcement samples in anisotropic stress conditions with optimal water contents showed no improvements, the samples with reduced water content showed fundamentally reduced permeabilities.

40|$|Turbulent {{stress is}} the {{fundamental}} quantity in the filtered equation for large-scale velocity that reflects its interactions with small-scale velocity modes. We develop {{an expansion of the}} turbulent stress tensor into a double series of contributions from different scales of motion and different orders of space-derivatives of velocity, a Multi-Scale Gradient (MSG) expansion. We compare our method with a somewhat similar expansion —due to Yeo and Bedford, and to Leonard—that is based instead on defiltering. Our MSG expansion is proved to converge to the exact stress, {{as a consequence of the}} locality of cascade both in scale and in space. Simple estimates show, however, that the convergence rate may be slow for the expansion in spatial gradients of very small scales. Therefore, we develop an approximate expansion, based upon an assumption that similar or ‘coherent ’ contributions to turbulent stress are obtained from disjoint subgrid regions. This Coherent-Subregions Approximation (CSA) yields an MSG expansion that can be proved to converge rapidly at all scales and is hopefully still reasonably accurate. As an important first application of our methods, we consider the cascades of energy and helicity in three-dimensional turbulence. To first order in velocity-gradients, the stress has three contributions: a <b>tensil...</b>|$|E
