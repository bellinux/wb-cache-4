5|$|At the marshal's signal, silence descended {{over the}} field and both knights spurred their horses and charged, their lances each {{striking}} the other's shield but not causing significant damage. Wheeling, both again struck but failed to penetrate, scoring glancing blows on their helmets but remaining horsed. For a third time they turned and charged and again they both struck. This time however the lances shattered, sending slivers of wood cartwheeling across the arena and nearly unseating both men. Regaining balance, the knights closed on one another with battle axes drawn, trading furious two-handed blows. As the engagement progressed, Le Gris' superior strength began to tell and Carrouges was driven back until with a mighty swing, Le Gris' axe severed the spine of Carrouges' horse. The dying beast tumbled to the ground, Carrouges leaping clear and meeting Le Gris' charge with a side-step, allowing him to <b>thrust</b> <b>his</b> own axe's pike deep into the stomach of Le Gris' steed.|$|E
5|$|Harclay had {{deployed}} his men on foot to {{hold the}} bridge from the northern side. Additional forces were placed at a nearby ford, though contemporary sources do not specify {{the exact location of}} this ford. The royal pikemen were deployed in a schiltron formation, a tactic learned from the Scots in the Scottish wars. The formation proved effective against the oncoming cavalry. The rebels divided into two columns; one led by Hereford and Roger de Clifford, attacking the bridge on foot, the other under Lancaster, trying to cross the ford by horse. According to a graphic description in the chronicle the Brut, Hereford was killed as he crossed the bridge by a pikeman hiding underneath, who <b>thrust</b> <b>his</b> spear up through the Earl's anus. Clifford was also severely injured, and that column of the army fell into disarray. Lancaster's party fared little better; under heavy archery fire his cavalry was cut off before it even reached the ford, and was forced to retreat. This event shows an early – if not entirely novel – effective use of the longbow against cavalry, a tactic which was to become central to future English military success.|$|E

Jim was arrested and spent a night in jail, before being bailed to return the following February. He was subsequently given an absolute discharge after agreeing to give around £500 to a Salvation Army charity and apologise to the complainants.|$|E
25|$|He was {{considered}} by some observers to have trouble against quality spin, especially against Indian off spinner Harbhajan Singh, who dismissed Ponting on 13 occasions in international cricket. Ponting {{had a tendency to}} rock onto the front foot and <b>thrust</b> <b>his</b> wrists at spinning deliveries, resulting in many catches close to the wicket. Ponting rarely employed the sweep shot against spin, something considered unusual for a top-order batsman. Instead, he looked to use his feet to come down the wicket to spinners, or play off the back foot through the off-side.|$|E

Sun Ce had 13 other men with him, including Han Dang, Song Qian and Huang Gai. Taishi Ci rode forth and engaged Sun Ce in battle. Sun Ce <b>thrust</b> <b>his</b> spear at Taishi Ci's horse and managed to grab the handheld ji that Taishi carried on his back. Taishi Ci, on the other hand, managed {{to get hold of}} Sun Ce's helmet. Their fight was broken up when their respective subordinates showed up.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} emphasized, {{to a level}} {{never before}} seen, the supposed sexual undercurrents {{of the story of}} Titania's infatuation with Bottom after he turns into an ass. Brook was influenced by Jan Kott's study of the play in Shakespeare Our Contemporary, in which Kott notes the phallic properties of the donkey, and argues that Oberon deliberately degrades Titania by exposing her to this monstrous sexuality. In Brook's staging, Bottom entered Titania's bower carried by the fairies, one of whom <b>thrust</b> <b>his</b> upraised arm between Bottom's legs to represent a phallus. In a jab at more traditional stagings, the sequence was accompanied by Mendelssohn's Wedding March, a piece of music originally written to be played as an intermezzo between Acts IV and V, but often used in more genteel productions for the final marriage scene of the play. Despite the disturbing undercurrents of this view of sexuality, many audience members found the play witty and affectionate in its treatment of sex, in tune with the spirit of 1960s permissiveness.|$|E
500|$|The Mahabharata {{describes}} him thus: Kabandha was [...] "as {{big as a}} mountain, dark as a black cloud, with pointed hairs {{all over}} his body and looked fierce with a voice as loud as thunder. He had an eye on his stomach, round and yellow, emitting a glare like a fire-name. Looking wicked he <b>thrust</b> <b>his</b> big tongue out of his huge mouth licking the sides." [...] The Ramayana presents a similar description of Kabandha. Kabandha had a broad chest and was without a head or neck. He had only one eye {{on his chest and}} a mouth on his belly. He used his long arms to draw his prey closer. Kabandha is often depicted as a tree.|$|E
2500|$|Legend {{has it that}} Saint Patrick's was {{the place}} where the {{expression}} [...] "chancing your arm" [...] (meaning to take a risk) originated, when Gerald Mór FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, cut a hole in a door there, still to be seen, and <b>thrust</b> <b>his</b> arm through it to shake hands in friendship, in an effort to call a truce in the Butler–FitzGerald dispute with James, Earl of Ormond in 1492.|$|E

2500|$|Sadler {{was unable}} to score {{anything}} close to a major success, though his [...] "The A-Team [...] " [...] was a Top 30 Billboard chart single during 1966. He took his honorable discharge from the Army in May 1967, and moved {{with his family to}} Tucson, Arizona. After minor acting roles in four episodes of two TV western series--"Death Valley Days and [...] "The High Chaparral"--and in the 1968 caper film Dayton's Devils starring Rory Calhoun, he moved to Nashville, and begin writing pulp fiction novels. His popular Casca series is about the title character, Casca Rufio Longinius (a combination of Longinus and the Wandering Jew), a legendary Roman soldier who <b>thrust</b> <b>his</b> lance into Christ's side during the crucifixion. Because of this, he is cursed to remain a soldier until the Second Coming. The novels feature Casca's life through the 20th century. Sadler wrote the first twenty-two books. After his death the series continued with books written by different authors.|$|E
2500|$|The sudden {{appearance}} of the English army caught the Norwegians by surprise. [...] Their response was to deploy rapidly [...] in a defensive circle. If the Norwegians were located at Battle Flats, {{there is no good}} explanation as to why they deployed into this formation. However, if they were located {{on the east side of}} the Derwent, the deployment made perfect sense. [...] By the time the bulk of the English army had arrived, the Vikings on the west side were either slain or fleeing across the bridge. The English advance was then delayed by the need to pass through the choke-point presented by the bridge itself. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle has it that a giant Norse axeman (possibly armed with a Dane Axe) blocked the narrow crossing and single-handedly held up the entire English army. The story is that this axeman cut down up to 40 Englishmen and was defeated only when an English soldier floated under the bridge in a half-barrel and <b>thrust</b> <b>his</b> spear through the planks in the bridge, mortally wounding the axeman.|$|E
2500|$|Akebono {{was one of}} {{the tallest}} sumo wrestlers ever, at [...] tall, and also one of the {{heaviest}} with a fighting weight around [...] He {{was also one of the}} most aggressive and ferocious sumo wrestlers. [...] Despite having long legs, considered a disadvantage in sumo as it tends to make one top heavy and susceptible to throws, he covered for this by training exceptionally hard, and using his long reach to <b>thrust</b> <b>his</b> opponents out of the dohyō (ring). [...] In his prime, he had incredible thrusting strength and on many occasions would blast lesser wrestlers out of the ring in one or two strokes using tsuppari techniques. His most common winning kimarite was oshi-dashi, a simple push out, and he also regularly won by tsuki-dashi, the thrust out. In later years he also used his reach to more often grab his opponent's mawashi, or belt, and then use his weight and power to force the opponent from the ring by yori-kiri. He liked a migi-yotsu, or left hand outside, right hand inside grip, and was fond of using his left hand to employ uwatenage, or overarm throw.|$|E

2500|$|The mytheme of the [...] "outlandish" [...] and [...] "savage" [...] Seven who {{threatened}} {{the city has}} traditionally seemed {{to be based on}} Bronze Age history in the generation before the Trojan War, when in the Iliads Catalogue of Ships only the remnant Hypothebai ("Lower Town") subsists on the ruins of Thebes. Yet archaeologists have been hard put to locate seven gates in [...] "seven-gated Thebes": In 1891 Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff declared that the seven gates existed only for symmetry with the seven assailants, whose very names vary: some have their own identity, like Amphiaraus the seer, [...] "who had his sanctuary and his cult afterwards... Others appear as stock figures to fill out the list," [...] Burkert remarks. [...] "To call one of them Eteoklos, vis-à-vis Eteokles the brother of Polyneikes, appears to be the almost desperate invention of a faltering poet" [...] Burkert follows a suggestion made by Ernest Howald in 1939 that the Seven are pure myth led by Adrastos (the [...] "inescapable") on his magic horse, seven demons of the Underworld; Burkert draws parallels in an Akkadian epic text, the story of Erra the plague god, and the Seven (Sibitti), called upon to destroy mankind, but who withdraw from Babylon at the last. The city is saved when the brothers simultaneously run each other through. Burkert adduces a ninth-century relief from Tell Halaf which would exactly illustrate a text from II Samuel [...] 2: [...] "But each seized his opponent by the forelock and <b>thrust</b> <b>his</b> sword into his side so that all fell together".|$|E
2500|$|Writer David Malitz of The Washington Post {{felt that}} the album [...] "is overstuffed with high-wattage cameos." [...] adding that [...] "Game {{surrounds}} himself with these stars, regularly gets out-rapped by them and proceeds to <b>thrust</b> <b>his</b> chest out and proclaim his superiority." [...] Los Angeles Times writer Mikael Wood commented that [...] "In stark contrast with such charm merchants as Jay-Z and Lil Wayne, Game’s low likability is no impediment to his art; indeed, The R.E.D. Album, his fourth studio set, succeeds not {{in spite of his}} character [...] flaws but because of them." [...] Carl Chery of XXL gave the album a rating of [...] "L" [...] and noted [...] "Game’s flows and lyrical skills are still sharp, but his narrative hasn’t changed much through the course of four albums". Despite that [...] "one shouldn’t be surprised," [...] David Amidon of PopMatters wrote [...] "A lot of what initially made Game an intriguing artist is missing from this release, replaced instead by fleeting moments of great music and extended periods of mediocrity or whackness." [...] and added that [...] "neither should one be surprised at the schizophrenic nature that pervades much of the album." [...] Pitchfork Media's Jordan Sargent commented that the albums [...] "unsightly storm of star power is the backbone [...] of what could've been a coherent album." [...] Arwa Haider of Metro viewed it as a [...] "cinematic drama of the rapper's Westside life experience, which could easily have become schmaltzy but is fuelled by his rugged wordplay and guests on sharp form." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wes Craven {{said his}} {{inspiration}} for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the [...] "worst thing" [...] he could think of. The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but he <b>thrust</b> <b>his</b> head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{fighting}} between the squadrons and the bombarding of Tripoli lasted three hours, with Preble's squadrons emerging victorious. [...] However, success and promotion were overshadowed by an unfortunate {{turn of events}} for Decatur. During the fighting Decatur's younger brother, James Decatur, in command of a gunboat, was mortally wounded by a Tripolitan captain during the boarding of a vessel feigning surrender. Midshipman Brown, who was next in command after James, managed {{to break away from}} the ambushing vessel and immediately approached Decatur's gunboat bringing the news of his brother's death. Decatur had just captured his first Tripolitan vessel and upon receiving the news turned command of his captured prize over to Lieutenant Jonathan Thorn and immediately set out to avenge his brother's treacherous death. After catching up with and pulling alongside the Tripolitan ship, Decatur was the first to board the enemy vessel with Midshipman Macdonough at his heels along with nine volunteer crew members. [...] Decatur and his crew were outnumbered 5 to 1 but were organized and kept their form, fighting furiously side by side. [...] Decatur had little trouble singling out the corsair captain, the man responsible for James' death, and immediately engaged the man. He was a large and formidable man in Muslim garb, and armed with a boarding pike he <b>thrust</b> <b>his</b> weapon at Decatur's chest. Armed with a cutlass Decatur deflected the lunge, breaking his own weapon at the hilt. [...] During the fight Decatur was almost killed by another Tripolitan crew member, but his life was spared by the already wounded Daniel Frazier, a crewman who threw himself over Decatur just in time, receiving a blow intended for Decatur to his own head. The struggle continued, with the Tripolitan captain, being larger and stronger than Decatur, gaining the upper hand. Armed with a dagger the Tripolitan attempted to stab Decatur in the heart, but while wrestling the arm of his adversary, Decatur managed to take hold of his pistol and fired a shot point-blank, immediately killing his formidable foe. When the fighting was over, 21 Tripolitans were dead with only three taken alive.|$|E
