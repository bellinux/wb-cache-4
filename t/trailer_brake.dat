2500|$|Honda lists a [...] towing {{capacity}} for the Ridgeline while accommodating an additional [...] to [...] (depending on trim level) of payload. [...] All models {{came with a}} heavy-duty radiator, integrated transmission and power steering coolers, dual 160W radiator fans, and were pre-wired for an electric <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> controller and a seven-pin or less trailer wiring harness. [...] Also, depending on trim level and model year, a class III tow hitch with a four-pin flat and/or seven-pin blade trailer wiring harness was either standard equipment or dealer installed options.|$|E
50|$|For the 2013 model year, Expedition {{received}} the TowCommand electronic <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> controller system, {{which is now}} equipped at the factory, included with the heavy-duty trailer towing package. The Expedition's <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> controller features +/- gain brake adjustment with support for heavy-duty trailers with up to four axles (quad axle trailers) and is compatible with electrically actuated trailer drum brakes and electric-over-hydraulic (EOH) actuated trailer drum or disc brake systems. The <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> controller is fully integrated into the Expedition's four-wheel, four-sensor, four-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS), and trailer sway control (TSC).|$|E
50|$|With {{adjustable}} +/- <b>trailer</b> <b>braking</b> gain in {{a digital}} readout from 0.0 (no <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes)</b> to 10.0 (full <b>trailer</b> <b>braking)</b> in 0.5 increments and a manual override lever (to test <b>trailer</b> <b>braking</b> action), the Ford 'built into the dash' TBC provides smooth braking even when pulling up to a 15,000 lb 4-axle conventional (receiver mounted) or 26,000 lb 4-axle 5th Wheel (bed/frame mounted) trailer. TowCommand being different from most aftermarket TBCs, ties into the trucks' computer and hydraulics, so it senses truck brake pressure and can apply <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> {{as fast as the}} truck's brakes. Master Brake Systems 'BrakeSmart' TBC is the only other TBC that taps into the trucks hydraulic lines in modern trucks.|$|R
50|$|Tractors used to {{be fitted}} with a lever in the cab to operate the <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes.</b> The vehicle could be slowed down or stopped using the <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> only. Theoretically this was a sure way to prevent {{jackknifing}}, but this lever was often the cause of jackknifing in a roundabout way. Frequent use of the <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> alone caused them to overheat and fade while the tractor brakes remained fresh. In {{the event of an}} emergency stop, the driver would go straight for the foot brake and the truck would surely jackknife because the tractor brakes would lock while the <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> would be ineffective due to previous overheating.|$|R
50|$|Brakes were {{air over}} {{hydraulic}} with drum brakes on all wheels. Air brake connections at the rear were used for <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes.</b> The M815, M818, and M819 had separate controls to apply the <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> separately from the service brakes.|$|R

50|$|The {{problem can}} be {{eliminated}} by minimising slack spring travel, and by {{reducing the amount of}} <b>trailer</b> <b>braking</b> force applied for a given drawbar force. However this results in the towing vehicle bearing some of the <b>trailer</b> <b>braking</b> load, something the towing vehicle is often not designed to do. The result is compromised braking.|$|R

50|$|An {{alternative}} {{to having a}} <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> lever in the cab is to fit the trailer with an electromagnetic brake.|$|E

50|$|The {{control system}} is further {{divided into two}} service brake {{circuits}}, the parking brake circuit, and the <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> circuit. The dual service brake circuits are further split into front and rear wheel circuits which receive compressed air from their individual reservoirs for added safety {{in case of an}} air leak. The service brakes are applied by means of a brake pedal air valve which regulates both circuits. The parking brake is the air operated spring brake type where its applied by spring force in the spring brake cylinder and released by compressed air via hand control valve. The <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover park brake air tank via a park brake relay valve and the control line is regulated via the <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> relay valve. The operating signals for the relay are provided by the prime mover brake pedal air valve, trailer service brake hand control (subject to local heavy vehicle legislation) and the prime mover park brake hand control.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, one lane of {{the toll}} booth was {{rendered}} inoperable after a <b>trailer's</b> <b>brakes</b> failed.|$|R
5000|$|As the {{towing vehicle}} <b>brakes,</b> the <b>trailer</b> travels forward, sliding the mechanism, for a {{distance}} before <b>trailer</b> <b>braking</b> begins.|$|R
50|$|A {{wide range}} of {{trailers}} will contain <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> (for example; larger boat trailers, horse trailers, covered utility trailers, enclosed trailers, travel trailers including small 10-foot and longer tent trailers and car carriers). Smaller trailers may not contain <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> (for example; basic 4'x8' utility trailers). It is highly recommended that, if the total trailer weight is over a couple thousand pounds, the trailer {{have some sort of}} braking system, and the tow vehicle be equipped with a brake controller.|$|R
50|$|Located {{near the}} same dash area {{as the last}} {{generation}} (but slightly {{to the right and}} more directly below the radio), this generation of Super Duty has the same Ford TowCommand TBC (<b>Trailer</b> <b>Brake</b> Controller) and 4 AUX Upfitter switches as the last generation set-up.|$|E
5000|$|Before ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) came to {{trucks in}} the 1980s, most TBCs were {{activated}} by the trucks' brake hydraulic action. In an emergency {{situation with the}} trucks ABS activated, Ford's TowCommand can automatically reduce the <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> pressure (gain) as it communicates with the truck's computer for faster reaction time with proportional <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> control, to prevent the trailer brakes from locking up even though trailers do not have ABS sensors. TowCommand will also inform the driver with an audible alarm and in the digital readout if the trailer wires and/or trailer disconnects from the truck. Next to the TowCommand is an empty storage tray or the $85 optional 4 AUX (auxiliary) toggle switches for winches, snow plow, off-road lights, etc.|$|E
50|$|From 1972 through 1980 the Paystar {{was offered}} in two ranges, the 5050 with {{mid-range}} engines, and the 5070 with heavy duty engines. Available as 4×4, 6×4, and 6×6 , they were usually straight trucks, most offered <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> options. Semi-tractors were also available, the F5070 had a Gross Combination Weight Rating {{of up to}} 120,000 lb.|$|E
50|$|Brakes {{were full}} air with drum brakes on all wheels. <b>Trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> {{could be used}} {{independently}} of the tractor. A disk type hand brake was mounted on the propeller shaft.|$|R
5000|$|The speed {{difference}} & inertia {{built up}} by now {{results in the}} <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> being rapidly & progressively applied ever harder, until trailer speed drops to below towing vehicle speed ...|$|R
25|$|Tires were 9.00x20 with dual rear tires. Brakes {{were full}} air with drum brakes on all wheels. Trailer air {{connections}} applied trailer-brakes with the truck brakes and a hand lever could apply the <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> alone.|$|R
50|$|Electric Friction Brake, often {{referred}} to as just Electric Brake or Electric <b>Trailer</b> <b>Brake</b> is a brake controlled by an electric current and are seen on medium duty trailers like caravans/RVs and Consumer-Grade Car Trailers. It is related to the Electromagnetic track brake used in railroad applications which also uses electric current to directly control the brake force.|$|E
50|$|Australia uses {{basically}} the same wiring with the exception for pin 5 and pin 2. The problematic part here is that pin 5 is used for <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> which means that if you for some reason connect an Australian trailer to a towing vehicle with ISO wiring you will get into trouble with the trailer brakes being applied {{as soon as you}} turn on the lights.|$|E
50|$|The 970 {{dump truck}} {{was built on}} the {{standard}} G509 chassis. The spare tires were mounted between the cab and bed. The tailgate could be opened at the top or bottom. Originally the dump trucks were not fitted with front winches in order to reduce front axle loading. After a Corps of Engineers request, winches were fitted from June 1944 onwards. The trucks had air brakes and <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> controls.|$|E
25|$|Prime {{movers and}} tankers had 10.00x22 size tires, while bridge, crane, and semi-tractor trucks had 14.00x20s {{with a larger}} cross-section. All had dual rear tires. Brakes were full air with drum brakes on all wheels. Prime movers had {{adjustable}} electrical <b>brake</b> connections for <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Air powered {{drum brakes}} were used on all axles; the <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> could be {{operated}} {{independently of the}} service brakes. A single disk transmission brake parking brake was also provided. This used four brake pads with a cable clasp mechanism onto a 16 in, mounted behind the auxiliary transmission.|$|R
50|$|Most basic brake {{controllers}} {{will generally}} have a +/- gain adjustment. The tow vehicle operator {{would set the}} gain as high as possible but without the <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> locking up after making a few test stops. The heavier the trailer, the higher the gain adjustment would be set and therefore the less chances of wheel lock-up.|$|R
5000|$|The {{optional}} factory in-dash installed Ford Motor Company [...] "TowCommand" [...] integrated TBC (<b>Trailer</b> <b>Brake</b> Controller) system {{available and}} compatible on the heavy duty commercial Ford Super Duty line of trucks {{starting with the}} 2005 models. TowCommand has since {{been added to the}} full-size Ford F-150 pickup and the full-size Ford Expedition SUV. It is built and engineered jointly with Tekonsha who are known for their Prodigy TBC.|$|E
50|$|The Class 101 {{was one of}} {{the largest}} classes of first-generation DMUs and, partly thanks to their {{relatively}} late withdrawal from revenue-earning service, numerous vehicles have been preserved on heritage railways, including the Great Central Railway and the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. There are only two centre cars preserved: one at the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway and the other at the Mid-Norfolk Railway. One buffet car survived and is at the Great Central Railway. No <b>Trailer</b> <b>Brake</b> Seconds were saved.|$|E
50|$|To the interior, several {{changes were}} made to improve {{functionality}} for end-users. Along {{with the addition of}} a driver-side glove compartment, the truck added the option of dashboard-mounted auxiliary switches (for owners who fit equipment such as snowplows, winches, and auxiliary lights); these are switches that were typically user designed. For users that tow, a new option was Ford TowCommand, a <b>Trailer</b> <b>brake</b> controller built into the dashboard, allowing it to integrate with the ABS system and engine computer from the factory.|$|E
5000|$|... {{since the}} towing vehicle is still slowing down, the whole cycle repeats itself. The result {{is not only}} severe vibration, {{but the lack of}} {{effectiveness}} of the <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> leaves the towing vehicle to do nearly all the braking. The front vehicle thus also fails to brake effectively, and lateral stability is also compromised, risking a jackknife situation.|$|R

5000|$|The tractor/cab, which {{pulls the}} trailer, {{and in some}} cases {{supplies}} power through the PTO.This tractor/cab always supplies the compressed air for the wheels' brakes of the sidelifter. Normally, the sidelifter can not be operated without being connected to the Tractor because even if the power pack is under the sidelifter, the tractor provides compressed air for the <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> and also additional stability for the lifting operation.|$|R
