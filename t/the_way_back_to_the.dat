5|$|The disorganized {{nature of}} the British retreat {{demonstrated}} a loss of effective command. An experienced commander could easily have encamped at the Lake George landing, taken stock of the situation, and begun siege operations against the French. Abercrombie, {{to the surprise of}} some in his army, ordered a retreat all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south end of Lake George. Nester, unable to find other rational reasons for this, claims that the general must have panicked.|$|E
5|$|During the happenings of the episode, a man playing Santa at a Christmas-themed ranch {{is shown}} videotaping the {{children}} at his ranch. Billie later tells Mulder that she saw a vision of her daughter in her room and that she said the number 74. Mulder decides he cannot finish the case and wants {{to take time off}} because he's too close to make any sound judgment. On their way to the airport, Scully comes across the Santa park (situated off of California State Route 74) and decides to stop because of the reference to Santa Claus in the notes. Here they find the videotape setup and tapes dating all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> '60s, including one of Amber Lynn LaPierre. The man who runs the park is promptly arrested, and Mulder finds graves of children all over his ranch.|$|E
5|$|During {{the seventeenth}} century the bonshō was also a symbol of a temple's leadership; {{possession}} of the bell indicated ownership of the associated temple. As a result, bells were often stolen; the folk hero Benkei {{is said to have}} dragged the three-ton bell of Mii-dera temple up Mount Hiei during one such theft. The deep scratches in the Benkei bell, which is still displayed at Mii-dera, are said in the legend {{to be the result of}} Benkei's kicking the bell all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monastery when he discovered that it would not toll for him. The Benkei bell is also associated with the legendary hero Tawara Tōda, who originally donated it to the Mii-dera temple. He acquired it as a gift from the dragon deity Ryūjin, after saving the god from a giant centipede.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to deceiving the French, the Rwandan government used the fake attack on Kigali on 4 October as the pretext for launching {{a wave of}} anti-Tutsi propaganda. They encouraged Hutu citizens to arrest Tutsi suspected of supporting the RPF. With French assistance, and benefiting {{from the loss of}} RPF morale after Rwigyema's death, the FAR enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF, and pushed the rebels all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ugandan border. Many soldiers deserted; some crossed back into Uganda, while others went into hiding in the Akagera National Park. The Rwandan government announced on 30 October that the war was over.|$|E
5|$|When King Powhatan is {{presented}} with the captured Smith, he decides, {{at the urging of}} the tribe’s priest Grimosco, to execute him. Pocahontas, having been moved by Smith’s nobility, says she will not allow Smith to be killed unless she herself dies with him. This persuades Powhatan to free Smith. Soon, Percy and Rolfe encounter Smith and his Indian allies on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> settlement, and Rolfe is immediately struck by Pocahontas, whose manner suggests the attraction is mutual. They speak of love, but Rolfe must soon depart with Smith. Pocahontas confesses her love for Rolfe to Miami, who receives the news with anger, jealousy and rage. Pocahontas convinces her father to dissolve her arranged engagement with Miami, which will mean war between their two tribes.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{communicate}} with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.|$|E

5|$|On television, the {{parallels}} between the weekly series that became the mainstay of prime-time programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long been clear. In the 1970s, original feature-length programming increasingly began to echo the B movie as well. As production of TV movies expanded {{with the introduction of}} the ABC Movie of the Week in 1969, soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original features, time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B picture territory. Television films inspired by recent scandals—such as The Ordeal of Patty Hearst, which premiered a month after her release from prison in 1979—harkened all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1920s and such movies as Human Wreckage and When Love Grows Cold, FBO pictures made swiftly in the wake of celebrity misfortunes. Many 1970s TV films—such as The California Kid (1974), starring Martin Sheen—were action-oriented genre pictures of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production. Nightmare in Badham County (1976) headed straight into the realm of road-tripping-girls-in-redneck-bondage exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Vermont left Valparaiso on 2 July, {{stopping}} in Callao, Peru on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Panama Canal. After {{returning to the}} United States, she resumed her training ship duties, which lasted almost {{to the end of}} the war. On 5 November, less than a week before the Armistice with Germany ended the fighting in Europe, Vermont was sent to the Philadelphia Navy Yard for conversion into a troop transport. She began her first transport mission on 9 January 1919; she made another three trips to return American soldiers from France, with the last concluding on 20 June 1919. In the course of these voyages, she carried some 5,000 men back to the United States. On 18 July, she steamed out of Norfolk for the last time, bound for the west coast of the United States. She visited San Diego, San Pedro, Monterey, San Francisco, and Long Beach in California, and Astoria, Oregon. Her final destination was the Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California, where she arrived on 18 September. She was decommissioned there on 30 June 1920 and reclassified as BB-20 on 17 July. She remained there until 10 November 1923, when she was struck from the Naval Vessel Registry. On 30 November, she was sold for scrap and broken up under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. Her bell currently resides at the Vermont State Capitol in Montpelier, VT.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, the Lingnan region's {{dominant}} language has been Cantonese (Jyutping: Gwong2 dung1 waa2; Traditional Chinese: 廣東話), {{a member of}} the Chinese language family (of which Mandarin is also a member).

This language can trace its root all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Nanyue people: Their language did not belong to the Chinese language family though. However, with the large influx of Han Chinese migrants during 10th to 13th centuries, the language slowly sinicized and evolved into modern Cantonese.|$|E

25|$|An urban myth is that Blackheath was {{associated}} with the 1665 Plague or the Black Death of the mid-14th century.

Virtually every part of London has a local tradition about plague pits under, say, a local school or shop. Certainly they were very common. The sheer number of bodies meant that the traditional churchyards became, as one contemporary put it, ‘overstuft’ very quickly.|$|E
