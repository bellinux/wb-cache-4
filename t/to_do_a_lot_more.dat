Of his exit, Lapinskas said [...] "I'm having a fantastic time working on EastEnders and {{playing the role of}} Anthony Moon. Working with David Essex, Tony Discipline and the EastEnders cast has been an absolute pleasure. Although I will really miss EastEnders and everyone involved, I am very excited about future projects and what is next for me as an actor." [...] Lapinskas revealed that Anthony's exit plot sees him make a [...] "big mistake". Anthony realises how much he loves Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks) but is unsure how to deal with her brother and father Joey (David Witts) and Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) respectively. Speaking to Soaplife, Lapinskas said [...] "Joey manipulates Anthony into challenging Derek, which is a big mistake. I can't give too much away, but I can tell you that after going up against Derek, Anthony {{has no choice but to}} leave the Square." [...] Magazine reports claim that Anthony packs his bags after losing everything to Joey and Derek, revising his gambling problem. Lapinskas hopes that Anthony will return someday. In an interview with Inside Soap, Lapinskas said that EastEnders was his first job outside of drama school and added that he has learnt a lot from the people he worked with. He also added [...] "I was quite disappointed when I found out Anthony {{would be leaving}}, I'd have liked <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> stuff with him. It's a shame to not be a part of what's coming up." ...|$|E

The historical account of 76 has the support of the Nigerian Military as the script went through a seven-month investigation and approval period before filming started. The military also assigned personnel to train the actors and guide the military aspect of the film. During the films development, the director tried to minimize violence as he wants people to focus on the story and not get distracted or pissed off by gory images.

5000|$|.....without {{a guitar}} player you can't {{rely on the}} {{standard}} hooks that punk rock and rock n' roll in general relies on. The guitar player - the guitar god quote unquote - was such a focus {{for so long that}} by the nature of not having a guitar player, the bass and the drums have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more.</b> It also makes the vocals more important, or at least it makes a lot more room for the vocals. You don't have guitar solos, you don't have the wash of high end. And the things you do on the drums are different, if you just did a straight four beat on the drums it would get kinda dull after awhile. It isn't as though bass guitar hasn't been a prominent instrument at times in other bands but it made us approach things differently, our song structure couldn't just be verse-chorus-verse. It had everything to do with how our sound got off to a unique start.|$|E

5000|$|Where Twitter enables {{journalists and}} newsreaders to connect, converse, and ideate, broadly speaking, Twitter {{empowers}} users to generate content, share, and converse with other users.

[...] In fact, many journalists have expanded their technological capabilities to include, for example, videographer and photographer. [...] Yet, the saturation of an issue, by way of a multitude of tweets on Twitter, is often too much for the larger body of users to absorb, resulting in a continued reliance on journalists to wade through, decipher, and provide in-depth coverage of issue referenced on Twitter. [...] The statement, [...] "Twitter is hardly a medium for deliberative democracy" [...] rings true. Twitter, then, cannot function to provide a depth of understanding, rather it relies on alternative platforms in which to unpack and contextualize pertinent issues.

I {{think one of the}} most important things about writing and aging as a band is showing growth and progression and a bit of variety in a sense. So we kind of took first two albums and did like a trial and error. We took what songs worked and tried to implement those ideas into songs on the new album. I think for people who have liked the band in the past, it will give them an opportunity to see the band in a new light. The focal points on the new album are a little bit different then the past. I think most times the songwriting gives me freedom <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> with the vocals. This time around, there was a lot more focal point on the guitar work and the musicianship behind the lyrics and the vocal patterns and everything. I think for us, it was important to do that because we’d never really had a chance to show what we’re all capable of. For me, it was a challenge because the music it wasn’t just a base foundation. It was there and there were intricate parts that I had to write around. I think overall, it shows growth." ...|$|E

5000|$|Cahill's book, A Saint on Death Row: The Story of Dominique Green, is a {{departure}} from The Hinges of History series. It is both the story of Dominique Green, {{a young man from}} Houston who was on Death Row in Texas, and of the effect that knowing him had on Cahill. Arrested at age eighteen in the fatal shooting of a man during a robbery outside a Houston convenience store, Green acknowledged he took part in the robbery but insisted he did not pull the trigger. Cahill first heard about Green from Judge Sheila Murphy who was working on the appeal of the case. She requested that he visit Green, which he did in December 2003. So impressed was Cahill with Green that he joined the ultimately-unsuccessful fight for Green's life, even enlisting Green's hero, Desmond Tutu, to make a historic visit to Dominique and to plead publicly for mercy. Green was executed at the age of 30 on October 26, 2004, after spending twelve years on Death Row. Green made a final statement before he was killed: [...] "There was {{a lot of people that}} got me to this point and I can't thank them all. But thank you for your love and support. They have allowed me <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> than I could have on my own. I have overcome a lot. I am not angry but I am disappointed that I was denied justice.
