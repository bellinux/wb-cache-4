One of them (the rK39 immunochromatographic test) gave correct, positive results in 92% of the people with visceral leishmaniasis and it gave correct, negative results in 92% of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not have the disease. A second rapid test (called latex agglutination test) gave correct, positive results in 64% of {{the people with the}} disease and it gave correct, negative results in 93% of the people without the disease. Other types of tests have not been studied thoroughly enough to ascertain their efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Hanging {{from the}} cross, Jesus prays to God asking {{forgiveness}} for <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> this to him, and redeems a criminal as a saint who is crucified beside him. Succumbing to impending death, Jesus gives up his spirit and dies. A single droplet of rain {{falls from the}} sky to the ground, triggering a sudden earthquake which destroys the temple and rips the cloth covering the Holy of Holies in two, to the horror of Caiaphas and the other priests. Satan is shown screaming in agonized defeat. Jesus' lifeless body is taken down from the cross, and entombed. In the end, the healed body of Jesus rises from the dead and exits the tomb resurrected.|$|E
25|$|A {{deterioration}} {{of relations between}} hellenized Jews and orthodox Jews led the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes to impose decrees banning certain Jewish religious rites and traditions. Consequently, the orthodox Jews revolted {{under the leadership of}} the Hasmonean family (also known as the Maccabees). This revolt eventually {{led to the formation of}} an independent Jewish kingdom, known as the Hasmonaean Dynasty, which lasted from 165 BCE to 63 BCE. The Hasmonean Dynasty eventually disintegrated as a result of civil war between the sons of Salome Alexandra, Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II. <b>The</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not want to be governed by a king but by theocratic clergy, made appeals in this spirit to the Roman authorities.

25|$|A storm forces Krug and {{his gang}} to seek refuge with John and Emma, whose house is nearby. Justin soon realizes that they are Mari's parents, and {{intentionally}} leaves Mari's necklace on the counter to alert them about their daughter. When John and Emma find Mari barely alive on their porch, and the necklace on the counter, they realize that <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> this to Mari are in their house. As they {{try to find the}} key to their boat so that they can take Mari to the hospital, they decide to get revenge on those responsible. When Francis happens upon Mari, he is attacked and killed by John and Emma. When the couple go after Krug and Sadie, they find Justin in possession of Krug's gun; Justin gives the gun to John so that he can kill Krug. Sadie awakens and interrupts John, allowing Krug to escape from the couple: he then realizes that they are Mari's parents. After Emma shoots Sadie in the head, John chases Krug. With a combined effort from Emma, John, and Justin, Krug is knocked unconscious. John paralyzes Krug from the neck down and leaves him to die with his head in an active microwave oven (his head explodes), then he, Emma, Mari, and Justin take the boat to the local hospital.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{thought he}} {{lost touch with}} American values while living in Paris, but his biographer Michael Reynolds claims the opposite, seeing {{evidence}} of the author's midwestern American values in the novel. [...] Hemingway admired hard work. He portrayed the matadors and the prostitutes, who work for a living, in a positive manner, but Brett, who prostitutes herself, is emblematic of [...] "the rotten crowd" [...] living on inherited money. It is Jake, the working journalist, who pays the bills again and again when those who can pay do not. Hemingway shows, through Jake's actions, his disapproval of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not pay up. [...] Reynolds says that Hemingway shows the tragedy, {{not so much of}} the decadence of the Montparnasse crowd, but of the decline in American values of the period. As such, the author created an American hero who is impotent and powerless. Jake becomes the moral center of the story. He never considers himself part of the expatriate crowd because he is a working man; to Jake a working man is genuine and authentic, {{and those who do not}} work for a living spend their lives posing.|$|E

2500|$|By 10:00, as {{the radio}} {{broadcast}} was announcing {{the introduction of}} martial law and a ban on groups larger than five persons, {{hundreds of thousands of}} people were gathering for the first time, spontaneously, in central Bucharest (the previous day's crowd had come together at Ceaușescu's orders). Ceaușescu attempted to address the crowd from the balcony of the Central Committee of the Communist Party building, but his attempt was met with a wave of disapproval and anger. Helicopters spread manifestos (which did not reach the crowd, due to unfavorable winds) instructing people not to fall victim to the latest [...] "diversion attempts," [...] but to go home instead and enjoy the Christmas feast.

2500|$|Eventually, {{however, the}} massive profits of drugs proved irresistible. According to Kevin Weeks, Jimmy, Stevie and I weren't in the import {{business}} and weren't {{bringing in the}} marijuana or the cocaine. We were in the shakedown business. We didn't bring drugs in; we took money off <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did.</b> We never dealt with the street dealers, but rather with a dozen large-scale drug distributors all over the State who were bringing in the coke and marijuana and paying hundreds of thousands to Jimmy. The dealers {{on the street corner}} sold eight-balls, ...grams, and half grams to customers for their personal use. They were supplied by the mid level drug dealer who was selling them multiple ounces. In other words, the big importers gave it to the major distributors, who sold it to the middlemen, who then sold it to the street dealers. In order to get to Jimmy, Stevie, and me, someone would have had to go through those four layers of insulation.|$|E
