5|$|Malaria was endemic in the marshlands {{of eastern}} Virginia during the time, and Cornwallis's army {{suffered}} greatly from the disease; he estimated during the surrender {{that half of}} his army was unable to fight as a result. The Continental Army enjoyed an advantage, in that most of their members {{had grown up with}} malaria, and hence had acquired resistance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> As malaria has a month-long incubation period, most of the French soldiers had not begun to exhibit symptoms before the surrender.|$|E
5|$|A typhus {{epidemic}} swept Montreal in late 1847 and Montreal's religious communities, including Cadron-Jetté and {{the staff}} of the hospice, were called upon by Bishop Bourget to assist in combating it. The hospice's chaplain and director, Antoine Rey, and its midwife, Madame Montrait, were among the nine priests and 13 Religious Sisters of Montreal who were killed by the disease. One of the hospice's penitents also died due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> Bishop Bourget subsequently named Father Venant Pilon as Rey's replacement as Director of the Hospice.|$|E

5|$|Appaloosas have an eightfold {{greater risk}} of {{developing}} Equine Recurrent Uveitis (ERU) than all other breeds combined. Up to 25percent of all horses with ERU may be Appaloosas. Uveitis in horses has many causes, including eye trauma, disease, and bacterial, parasitic and viral infections, but ERU is characterized by recurring episodes of uveitis, rather than a single incident. If not treated, ERU can lead to blindness, which occurs more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds. Eightypercent of all uveitis cases are found in Appaloosas with physical characteristics including roan or light-colored coat patterns, little pigment around the eyelids and sparse hair in the mane and tail denoting the most at-risk individuals. Researchers may have identified a gene region containing an allele that makes the breed more susceptible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
5|$|As a crop, the {{blackcurrant}} {{suffers from}} several pests and diseases. The most serious disease is reversion, {{caused by a}} virus transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite. Another is {{white pine blister rust}} which alternates between two unrelated hosts, one in the genus Ribes (blackcurrant included) and the other a white pine. This fungus caused damage to forests when the fruit was first introduced into North America, where the native white pines have no genetic resistance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> As a result, the blackcurrant has for most of the 20th century been subject to restrictions in parts of the United States as a disease vector. The effectiveness of these restrictions is questionable, since other Ribes species also host the disease and are native to North America.|$|E
5|$|As soon as Glynne {{graduated}} she {{was offered}} a post in the University College of North Wales department of agriculture, but {{within a few months}} she was volunteering at Rothamsted Experimental Station where E. John Russell was director. Winifred Brenchley, the first woman to work in agricultural sciences, soon offered her a permanent assistant botanist position at Rothamsted, where she remained for 43 years. Glynne was one of the original members of the Mycology Department in 1918 and later founded the Plant Pathology Department. Glynne's first major work was studying Synchytrium endobioticum, the cause of potato wart disease. A modified version of her method for identifying varieties resistant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease,</b> the Glynne-Lemmerzahl method, is still in use today. The work was sufficiently notable that the University of Wales awarded Glynne an MSc in 1922 for her achievements.|$|E

50|$|Numerous other {{diseases}} {{were brought to}} North America, including bubonic plague, chickenpox, cholera, the common cold, diphtheria, influenza, malaria, measles, scarlet fever, sexually transmitted diseases, typhoid, typhus, tuberculosis, and pertussis (whooping cough). Each of these brought destruction through sweeping epidemics, involving disability, illness, and extensive deaths. Native Americans, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lack of prior contact with Europeans, had not previously been exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>diseases</b> that were prevalent on the distant continent. Therefore, they had not built up internal immunities <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>diseases</b> or formed any medicines to combat them. Europeans came into the New World bearing various diseases. Those infected with diseases either possessed them in a dormant state or were not quarantined {{in such a way}} that distanced them enough from Native Americans not <b>to</b> spread <b>the</b> <b>diseases,</b> allowing them <b>to</b> spread into epidemics.|$|R
5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Before Dorne fully succumbs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease,</b> they do {{tests on}} him {{to figure out a}} cure. They {{determined}} that the only possible way to fight it would be to make a vaccine that uses the original source of the disease. While the origin of the virus is tracked back to being on Roak itself, it is from Asmodeus, the King of the Demon World, who had been killed 300 years prior to the spread of the disease. Ronyx talks the group into using a Time Gate on the Planey Styx to go back 300 years into the past to track down Asmodeus back when he was still alive. While this works, Ilia trips while approaching the gate. As such, Ilia and Roddick have a delay from when they enter the time gate, and after the trip through time, they find themselves separated from Ronyx and Millie. The two groups work towards locating each other, and Asmodeus, in efforts to heal their family members and stop the war.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the type}} of tumor, paraneoplastic phenomena—symptoms not due to the local {{presence}} of cancer—may initially attract attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> In lung cancer, these phenomena may include hypercalcemia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH, abnormally concentrated urine and diluted blood), ectopic ACTH production, or Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (muscle weakness due to autoantibodies). Tumors {{in the top of the}} lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to Horner's syndrome (dropping of the eyelid and a small pupil on that side), as well as damage to the brachial plexus.|$|E

In Bad Boys Love, it is revealed that Hatoful is set in a post-apocalyptic, dystopian future—in which a pandemic of a deadly, mutated strain of the H5N1 virus, or bird flu, nearly wipes out mankind in the year 2068. The release of a counter-virus, cultivated to destroy the virus' avian carriers {{in a desperate attempt to}} stop the spread of the disease, ends up backfiring as birds who resisted the counter-virus instead developed human-level intelligence. War soon breaks out between the newly uplifted birds and the remnants of humanity, resulting in birds emerging as the planet's new dominant lifeforms as humans continued to succumb <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> Following several terrorist attacks by a human insurgency, all remaining humans have been forced to live in the wilderness away from civilization in a form of apartheid-like segregation.|$|E
5|$|He also {{experienced}} stomach disease, having a low production of gastric acids. This was worsened by harsh military conditions, including long periods with little food. The first references <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> {{that would lead}} to his death, a case of edema, are from a year before, in a letter directed to Álvarez Thomas. He declared having problems in the chest, a lung, and his right leg. A later letter to Sarratea confirmed his situation, and specified that it started on 23 April 1819. The gravity of his condition led the doctor Francisco de Paula Rivero to diagnose an advanced dropsy. Belgrano returned to Buenos Aires, where he died. He was embalmed by Joseph Redhead and Juan Sullivan. Sullivan performed the autopsy; it revealed high levels of fluid in multiple edemas and a tumor in the right epigastrium. The liver and spleen had grown beyond normal levels, there were hamartomas in the kidneys, and problems with the lungs and heart.|$|E
25|$|Liver: Liver {{problems}} {{in people with}} rheumatoid arthritis may be due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> underlying <b>disease</b> process or {{as a result of}} <b>the</b> medications used <b>to</b> treat <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> A coexisting autoimmune liver disease, such as primary biliary cirrhosis or autoimmune hepatitis may also cause problems.|$|R

5|$|In Europe, {{deaths from}} {{smallpox}} often changed dynastic succession. The only surviving son of Henry VIII, Edward VI, died from complications shortly after apparently {{recovering from the}} disease, thereby nullifying Henry's efforts to ensure a male successor to the throne (his two immediate successors were both women, who had both had it and survived). Louis XV of France succeeded his great-grandfather Louis XIV {{through a series of}} deaths of smallpox or measles among those earlier in the succession line. He himself died of the disease in 1774. William III lost his mother <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> when he was only ten years old in 1660, and named his uncle Charles as legal guardian: her death from smallpox would indirectly spark a chain of events that would eventually lead to the permanent ousting of the Stuart line from the British throne. William III's wife, Mary II of England, died from smallpox as well.|$|E
5|$|Iron {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common nutritional deficiency in the world. When loss of iron is not adequately compensated by adequate dietary iron intake, a state of latent iron deficiency occurs, which over time leads to iron-deficiency anemia if left untreated, which is characterised by an insufficient number of red blood cells and an insufficient amount of hemoglobin. Children, pre-menopausal women (women of child-bearing age), and people with poor diet are most susceptible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> Most cases of iron-deficiency anemia are mild, but if not treated can cause problems like fast or irregular heartbeat, complications during pregnancy, and delayed growth in infants and children.|$|E
5|$|Many {{microbes}} {{have been}} proposed as triggers of MS, but none have been confirmed. Moving {{at an early age}} from one location in the world to another alters a person's subsequent risk of MS. An explanation for this could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread microbe rather than a rare one, is related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> Proposed mechanisms include the hygiene hypothesis and the prevalence hypothesis. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that exposure to certain infectious agents early in life is protective, the disease being a response to a late encounter with such agents. The prevalence hypothesis proposes that the disease is due to an infectious agent more common in regions where MS is common and where in most individuals it causes an ongoing infection without symptoms. Only in a few cases and after many years does it cause demyelination. The hygiene hypothesis has received more support than the prevalence hypothesis.|$|E
