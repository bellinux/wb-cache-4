40|$|Sucrose {{solubility}} {{was measured}} in binary and ternary mixtures of alcohol, acid, ester, and water at different temperatures. New data were measured for the solubility of sucrose in mixtures of 2 -methyl- 2 -butanol (<b>tert-pentanol)</b> with water at 30 degreesC and 60 degreesC, propionic acid with water at 30 degreesC, methyl and ethyl acetate with water at 40 degreesC and 50 degreesC, and octanoic acid with <b>tert-pentanol</b> at 60 degreesC and in diacetone alcohol at 60 degreesC. Solubility measurements were also performed in multicomponent mixtures similar to those encountered in the enzymatic synthesis of fatty acid sucrose esters. Sucrose solubility {{was measured in}} mixtures of water with <b>tert-pentanol</b> and sucrose palmitate and in mixtures of water with <b>tert-pentanol,</b> sucrose palmitate and palmitic acid at constant water activity (a(w) = 0. 1) at 60 degreesC. Little solubilization of sucrose in small chain esters and <b>tert-pentanol</b> was observed. The solubility of sucrose in <b>tert-pentanol</b> increases {{in the presence of}} sucrose ester and the opposite effect in the presence of palmitic acid...|$|E
40|$|The {{solubilities}} {{of three}} cinnamic acid esters, namely, methyl ferulate, methyl p-coumarate, and methyl sinapate, have been measured in tert-butanol, <b>tert-pentanol,</b> ethyl acetate, and n-hexane, at the temperature range of (303. 15 to 321. 15) K. It is shown that <b>tert-pentanol</b> {{is the best}} solvent for methyl p-coumarate and methyl ferulate and ethyl acetate for methyl sinapate, while the nonpolar n-hexane is the worst solvent. Using the experimentally measured solubilities, the thermodynamic properties of dissolution of the three esters have been calculated. To better understand the solubilization process, the melting temperatures and the enthalpies of fusion of the three esters were determined by differential scanning calorimetry. Finally, successful correlation of the experimental data was achieved with the UNIQUAC and the nonrandom twoliquid (NRTL) activity coefficient models. © 2010 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|Enzymatic {{alcoholysis}} of {{fish oil}} can produce monoacylglycerols rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids at atmospheric pressure and low temperature. Biocatalysis in organic solvents helps {{to create a}} homogeneous reaction system for the reactants, ethanol and fish oil. This work presents liquid–liquid equilibrium at two different temperatures (303. 2 K and 323. 2 K) and at atmospheric pressure for two solvent-systems in the ethanolysis of fish oil: ethanol + oil + <b>tert-pentanol</b> and ethanol + oil + hexane. Experimental solubility (binodal) curves were obtained by the cloud point method and tie-line composition was obtained by density and high-temperature gas chromatography. The consistency of experimental tie-line data was checked by using the Othmer–Tobias equation. The experimental liquid–liquid data were correlated satisfactorily by the nonrandom two liquid model for activity coefficient calculations. MINECO (CTQ 2012 - 39131 -C 02 - 01) and CDTI (ref.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} experimental liquid-liquid equilibrium of ternary {{systems of}} furfural, water and solvent. This study {{belongs to a}} large project on computational aspects of phase equilibrium and experimental phase equilibrium measurements on biorefinery concepts funded by Academy of Finland (decision ID 253336). Liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) and selection of solvent are important in modelling extraction process because the components typically are highly diluted in water. Within {{the scope of the}} project the review on existing measurements on liquid-liquid equilibria revealed that only 4 -Methyl- 2 -pentanone (methyl isobutyl ketone) and 2 -methyl- 2 -butanol (<b>tert-pentanol)</b> had some ternary LLE at room temperature with furfural and water. 2 -Butanol had no ternary LLE with furfural and water. The experiments carried out with a system of thermostated cells equipped with mixer. The systems under investigation were MIBK + furfural + water, <b>tert-pentanol</b> + furfural + water and 2 -butanol + furfural + water from room temperature up to 70 C. Acetone was used as an internal standard technique and samples were analysed by using a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with non-polar GC column to the flame ionisation detector (FID) and polar GC column to the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) in parallel. For every system the samples were taken {{with the help of a}} syringe. Binary samples were repeated several times at several temperatures. The ternary systems were measured at three isotherms. The MIBK + furfural + water system was the reference system and the trend of the points was very close to the literature data. For the system tert – pentanol + furfural + water it was observed the same result. For the system 2 -butanol + furfural + water there were no literature data. This system was the most challenging to measure because of a long settling time. In addition the system exhibits two liquid-liquid regions which means that it is not suitable as a solvent for extraction purpose...|$|E
40|$|Monoacylglycerols (MAGs) can be {{produced}} by lipase-catalyzed glycerolysis of oils and fats at atmospheric pressure and low temperature. The use of organic solvents as reaction media helps to create a homogeneous reaction system between the immiscible reactants glycerol and oil. In this work liquid–liquid equilibrium at two different temperatures (303. 2 and 323. 2 K) and at atmospheric pressure has been determined for two solvent-systems in the glycerolysis of fish oil (sardine oil) : glycerol + sardine oil + tert-butanol and glycerol + sardine oil + <b>tert-pentanol.</b> From the experimental solubility (binodal) curves and tie-lines, it could be observed that the system mutual solubility does not significantly increase by increasing temperature from 303. 2 to 323. 2 K. The Othmer–Tobias correlation was {{used to analyze the}} consistency of the tie-line data. The experimental liquid–liquid data were correlated satisfactorily by using the NRTL model for the activity coefficient calculation. MINECO (CTQ 2012 - 39131 -C 02 - 01) and CDTI (Ref.
