5|$|Radu is {{interviewed in}} {{this portion of}} the film, as is Tournecuillert, who speaks about his {{experiences}} in Albania, where he heard about the sex trafficking of girls and how some of the girls would be shot or burned to death as a warning to the other girls. He describes how Albanian girls are often rounded up <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sexually</b> trafficked in Italy. He further explains that, normally, before they leave Albania, the traffickers kill one of the girls in front of the others—usually by burning or shooting—to demonstrate what will happen to others who try to escape. Matei adds that, for the sake of amusement, some of the girls would be buried alive with only their heads remaining above ground. Eugenia Bonetti, a nun, speaks about her work helping girls escape from slavery in Italy.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{woodpeckers}} {{varies from}} drab to conspicuous. The colours of many species {{are based on}} olive and brown and some are pied, suggesting a need for camouflage; others are boldly patterned in black, white and red, and many have a crest or tufted feathers on the crown. Woodpeckers tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sexually</b> dimorphic, but differences between the sexes are generally small; exceptions to this are Williamson's sapsucker and the orange-backed woodpecker, which differ markedly. The plumage is moulted fully once a year apart from the wrynecks, which have an additional partial moult before breeding.|$|E
25|$|Asplenium resiliens is a {{triploid}} and reproduces apogamously, producing 32 spores per sporangium. Specimens with 64 well-formed spores per sporangium, believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sexually</b> reproducing, {{were collected}} from Green Gulch in the Chisos Mountains in 1937, although other specimens since collected in the area have the typical 32 spores per sporangium.|$|E

25|$|Abolitionists {{who seek}} {{an end to}} sex {{trafficking}} explain the nature of sex trafficking as an economic supply and demand model. In this model, male demand for prostitutes leads to a market of sex work, which, in turn, fosters sex trafficking, the illegal trade and coercion of people into sex work, and pimps and traffickers become 'distributors' who supply people <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sexually</b> exploited. The demand for sex trafficking can also be facilitated by some pimps' and traffickers' desire for women whom they can exploit as workers {{because they do not}} require wages, safe working circumstances, and agency in choosing customers.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{violence}} {{committed by}} men is {{to a large}} extent rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement. These belief systems grant women extremely few legitimate options to refuse sexual advances. Some men thus simply exclude the possibility that their sexual advances towards a woman might be rejected or that a woman has the right to make an autonomous decision about participating in sex. In some cultures women, as well as men, regard marriage as entailing the obligation on women <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sexually</b> available virtually without limit, though sex may be culturally proscribed at certain times, such as after childbirth or during menstruation.|$|E
25|$|Van Stipriaan further {{reports that}} other tales {{describe}} river travellers (usually men) chancing upon the spirit. She is inevitably grooming herself, combing her hair, and peering {{at herself in}} a mirror. Upon noticing the intruder, she flees {{into the water and}} leaves her possessions behind. The traveller then takes the invaluable items. Later, Mami Wata appears to the thief in his dreams to demand the return of her things. Should he agree, she further demands a promise from him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sexually</b> faithful to her. Agreement grants the person riches; refusal to return the possessions or to be faithful brings the man ill fortune.|$|E

25|$|Commonly, {{heterosexual}} men reject {{the idea of}} being receptive partners during anal sex because they believe it is a feminine act, can make them vulnerable, or contradicts their sexual orientation (for example, that it is indicative that they are gay). The BMJ stated in 1999, however:There are little published data on how many {{heterosexual men}} would like their anus <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sexually</b> stimulated in a heterosexual relationship. Anecdotally, it is a substantial number. What data we do have almost all relate to penetrative sexual acts, and the superficial contact of the anal ring with fingers or the tongue is even less well documented but may be assumed to be a common sexual activity for men of all sexual orientations.|$|E
25|$|According to a study, {{girls who}} {{participate}} in girls-only activities are {{far less likely to}} experience a teenage pregnancy and less likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sexually</b> active in general. Participating in competitive sports has also shown to have an effect for girls. A study published in 1999 found that female adolescents who participated in sports were less likely than their non-athletic peers to engage in sexual activity and/or report a pregnancy. Males interested in arts are also less likely to be involved in a pregnancy situation. It is unclear whether these correlations are causal or the reflection of the underlying bias of the considered population. The study that reported these findings did {{not take into account the}} sexual orientation of the subjects.|$|E
25|$|Several studies {{comparing}} bisexuals with hetero- or homosexuals {{have indicated}} that bisexuals have higher rates of sexual activity, fantasy or erotic interest. Van Wyk and Geist (1984) found that male and female bisexuals had more sexual fantasy than heterosexuals. Dixon (1985) found that bisexual men had more sexual activities with women than did heterosexual men. Bisexual men masturbated more but had fewer happy marriages than heterosexuals. Bressler and Lavender (1986) found that bisexual women had more orgasms per week and they described them as stronger than those of hetero- or homosexual women. They also found that marriages with a bisexual female were happier than heterosexual unions, observed less instance of hidden infidelity, and ended in divorce less frequently. Goode and Haber (1977) found bisexual women <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sexually</b> mature earlier, masturbate and enjoy masturbation more and to be more experienced in different types of heterosexual contact.|$|E
50|$|Aegyptopitheccus zeuxis <b>is</b> thought <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>sexually</b> dimorphic. Tooth size, craniofacial morphology, brain size, {{and body}} mass all {{indicate}} this.

50|$|Research {{has also}} {{indicated}} an anti-academic male sex/gender identity. Parry wrote that “according <b>to</b> teachers, males <b>are</b> <b>sexually</b> rejected by their female peers”.|$|R
50|$|A 2011 {{report found}} that women in the U.S. {{military}} <b>are</b> more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> raped by fellow soldiers than they <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> killed in combat. At least 25% of U.S. military women have <b>been</b> <b>sexually</b> assaulted, and up <b>to</b> 80% have <b>been</b> <b>sexually</b> harassed.|$|R
25|$|The {{timing of}} puberty can have {{important}} {{psychological and social}} consequences. Early maturing boys are usually taller and stronger than their friends. They have the advantage in capturing the attention of potential partners and in becoming hand-picked for sports. Pubescent boys often {{tend to have a}} good body image, are more confident, secure, and more independent. Late maturing boys can be less confident because of poor body image when comparing themselves to already developed friends and peers. However, early puberty is not always positive for boys; early sexual maturation in boys can be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of hormones that affect them. Because they appear older than their peers, pubescent boys may face increased social pressure to conform to adult norms; society may view them as more emotionally advanced, despite the fact that their cognitive and social development may lag behind their appearance. Studies have shown that early maturing boys are more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sexually</b> active {{and are more likely to}} participate in risky behaviors.|$|E
25|$|Like {{people of}} other LGBT sexualities, bisexuals often face discrimination. In {{addition}} to the discrimination associated with homophobia, bisexuals frequently contend with discrimination from gay men, lesbians, and straight society around the word bisexual and bisexual identity itself. The belief that everyone is bisexual (especially women as opposed to men), or that bisexuality does not exist as a unique identity, is common. This stems from two views: In the heterosexist view, people are presumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sexually</b> attracted to the opposite sex, and it is sometimes reasoned that a bisexual person is simply a heterosexual person who is sexually experimenting. In the monosexist view, {{it is believed that}} people cannot be bisexual unless they are equally sexually attracted to both sexes, regulating sexual orientation to being about the sex or gender one prefers. In this view, people are either exclusively homosexual (gay/lesbian) or exclusively heterosexual (straight), closeted homosexual people who wish to appear heterosexual, or heterosexuals who are experimenting with their sexuality. Assertions that one cannot be bisexual unless equally sexually attracted to both sexes, however, are disputed by various researchers, who have reported bisexuality to fall on a continuum, like sexuality in general.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) struggles with his {{feelings}} for another page, Grace Park (Charlyne Yi) who demonstrates affection for him. Kenneth explains to Pete {{that he is}} afraid of [...] "disgracing the peacock" [...] by becoming romantically involved with her. Throughout the episode, it is shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sexually</b> awkward {{for the two of}} them during their job, though towards the end, Kenneth confronts her with his feelings about her. Their kiss is interrupted by Kenneth's work, which allows him to abruptly forget about her.|$|E
50|$|Bisexual Americans {{were given}} some {{visibility}} {{in the research}} of Alfred Kinsey (who was himself bisexual) and {{his colleagues in the}} late 1940s and early 1950s; they found that 28% of women and 46% of men had responded erotically <b>to</b> or <b>were</b> <b>sexually</b> active with both women and men.|$|R
50|$|Elisa claimed <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>sexually</b> {{victimized by}} a {{neighbor}} {{when she was}} between 14 and 18 years of age. She maintained she repressed all memories of this abuse until her therapist questioned her about the possibility. After developing the memories, she sued the neighbor, who denied the abuse.|$|R
50|$|Nicole Pearce {{left school}} aged 16 {{and went on}} the dole, supplementing her income by prostituting herself to men. In an {{analysis}} by criminologist Paul Wilson, he alleged <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>sexually</b> assaulted at home over a five-day period, but reported enjoying the experience and enjoyed dressing in women's clothing.|$|R
500|$|Adjusting to {{post-injury}} {{changes in}} the body's sensation is difficult enough to cause some {{to give up on}} the idea of satisfying sex at first. But changes in sensitivity above and at the level of injury occur over time; people may find erogenous zones like the nipples or ears have become more sensitive, enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sexually</b> satisfying. They may discover new erogenous zones that were not erotic before the injury; care providers can help direct this discovery. These erogenous areas can even lead to orgasm when stimulated. Such changes may result from [...] "remapping" [...] of sensory areas in the brain due to neuroplasticity, particularly when sensation in the genitals is completely lost.|$|E
500|$|Daphne Bramham of the Vancouver Sun {{commented that}} [...] "what's {{entertaining}} {{about women in}} lingerie hanging by their necks on chains? What's artful about images of drugged, unconscious women about <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sexually</b> assaulted?" [...] Mikhail Lyubansky of the Huffington Post had a negative opinion of the video, stating that the video [...] "not-so-subtly suggests that complete female passivity, lifelessness, and even death are erotic", and interpreted {{the message of the}} video as being that [...] "for women, what's sexually desirable is passivity, lifelessness, and death." [...] The release of the video was received by American activist Ann Simonton with an internet petition seeking the preemptive removal of the full video from broadcast or promotion, criticizing the video as glorifying sexual violence against women.|$|E
500|$|... and {{the numbers}} who report being sexually {{satisfied}} range from 40–88%. Although women's satisfaction is usually lower than before the injury, it improves as time passes. Women report higher rates of sexual satisfaction than men post-SCI {{for as many as}} 10–45 years. More than a quarter of men have substantial problems with adjustment to their post-injury sexual functioning. Sexual satisfaction depends on a host of factors, some more important than the physical function of the genitals: intimacy, quality of relationships, satisfaction of partners, willingness <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sexually</b> experimental, and good communication. Genital function is not as important to men's sexual satisfaction as are their partners' satisfaction and intimacy in their relationships. For women, quality of relationships, closeness with partners, sexual desire, and positive body image, as well as the physical function of the genitals, contribute sexual satisfaction. For both sexes, long-term relationships are associated with higher sexual satisfaction.|$|E
5000|$|Child {{sexual abuse}} has <b>been</b> {{connected}} <b>to</b> later emotional and behavioural problems in victims, {{and to an}} increased tendency toward alcoholism, depression, mental illness, and suicide. In 2007 the Queensland Children's Commission reported that [...] "some 70% of psychiatric patients <b>are</b> known <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>sexually</b> abused aschildren". A study carried out in 27 prisons in New South Wales found that 65% {{of male and female}} prisoners had <b>been</b> <b>sexually</b> and physically abused as children.|$|R

50|$|Based on {{research}} conducted after his death, Røed <b>is</b> believed <b>to</b> have contracted HIV in Cameroon in 1961 or 1962, where he <b>was</b> known <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>sexually</b> active with many African women, including prostitutes.

500|$|... "Christmas Tree" [...] is {{a version}} of the {{traditional}} Christmas song [...] "Deck the Halls", with the same melody but with lyrics changed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sexually</b> suggestive, with many sexual innuendos and metaphors.

In an analysis by Stelios Phili of the Washington Square News, Phili jokes that the meaning of the song is closer to the original version of [...] "Deck the Halls", a Welsh folk song called [...] "Nos Galan" [...] (Welsh for [...] "New Year's Eve") traditionally sung at New Year's Eve, than the English Christmas version. He cites the original first line, [...] "Cold is the man who can't love", and says that Gaga [...] "seeks not to warn against becoming a cold, loveless man, but to prevent that fate by way of some hot lovin'".|$|E
500|$|Stone {{began her}} acting career with {{a role in}} a theater {{production}} of The Wind in the Willows in 2000.

500|$|Video games' {{progression}} {{into the}} 1990s brought dramatic increases in graphics and sound capabilities, {{and the ability}} to use full-motion video (FMV) content in games. In the United States Senate, Democratic Senators Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Herb Kohl of Wisconsin led hearings on video game violence and the corruption of society which began in 1992. Two games of this era were specifically cited in the hearings for their content; the fighting game Mortal Kombat featured realistic, digitized sprites of live-action actors, blood, {{and the ability to}} use violent [...] "fatality" [...] moves to defeat opponents, while Night Trap featured 90 minutes of FMV content, with scenes that were considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sexually</b> suggestive and exploitive. [...] Both Nintendo and Sega had differing views on objectionable content in video games; a port of Mortal Kombat for the Super NES was censored to remove the game's overly violent content, whereas the port for Sega consoles retained much of this content, which helped increase sales.|$|E
