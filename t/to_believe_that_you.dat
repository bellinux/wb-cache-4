Nadal's family turned down this request, partly because they feared it would hurt his education, but also because Toni said that [...] "I don't want <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{have to go to}} America, or other places to be a good athlete.

But can we see each other then? Suppose she stood beside someone else. When she stands that way within time, I am standing in her path and therefore shall go away.
