[...] In September 2014, the Supreme Court of Italy in ruling 19161/2014 decided that a laptop buyer was entitled to receive a refund of €140 {{for the price of}} a Microsoft Windows license and a Microsoft Works license on a computer, saying that bundling was [...] "a commercial policy of forced distribution" [...] and slammed this practice as [...] "monopolistic in tendency". [...] In India bundling is challenged by users as a violation of Competition Act 2002 and one of them has sent a legal notice to HP. [...] However, in another license refund case, a French appellate court ruled in favor of the OEM, [...] "holding that the sale at issue did not constitute the unfair commercial practice of coercive selling, which is not permitted under any circumstances, an unfair commercial <b>tying</b> <b>practice,</b> or a misleading or aggressive commercial practice."

Using a model that highlights distinct features of the instant messenger, which {{are different from the}} cases of the web browser and the media player, we show that Microsoft can leverage its monopoly power in the operating system (OS) market to the instant messenger market through tying strategy. Microsoft's messenger tying hurts consumers because it enables Microsoft to monopolize messenger market and so fully exploit consumer's willingness to pay to the OS-messenger bundle. However, since tying saves installing costs, consumer loss is not so serious that total surplus improves under messenger tying. Finally we show that such results are robust to the possibilities of multi-homing {{in the instant}} messenger market. Microsoft, instant messenger, tying, foreclosure, multi-homing...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{intends to}} analyze and clarify the legal {{position}} regarding abuse of a dominant position and particularly tying practices. The practice is central within European competition law and has been highly discussed in literature recently. In Article 102 TFEU it is explicitly stated that supplementary obligations which have no connection with the subject of such contracts, shall {{be considered as a}} way of abusing a position of strength. Although the method is often reasonable and very common within many business areas, it might be pursued as a tactic of excluding competition. The General Court’s decision in Microsoft led to some confusion as regards to the European approach towards tying practices. Prior to that judgment, the EU Courts appeared quite negative to the practice and seemed determined that the practice was in fact anticompetitive. For an example, in Hilti the Court found it sufficient that the company had deprived its costumers of a choice. The effects on competition were not analyzed in great detail and in most cases the EU Courts fined the undertaking involved in such business methods. However, in Microsoft the General Court took a new approach and focused on the actual effects that followed from the practice. Many argues that European competition law has moved from a per se approach to a rule of reason approach. In my opinion however, it seems relatively unclear whether or not this new approach shall apply to all versions of tying or if it was applied due to the certain circumstances involved in Microsoft. The <b>tying</b> <b>practice</b> involved a form of technical tying, i. e. an integration of two distinctive products. Cases prior to Microsoft mostly concerned a form of contractual tying and were treated very differently by the EU Courts. My opinion on the matter is therefore that {{it is not possible to}} declare a clear legal position regarding the practice of tying. There is a need for new judgments and official guidelines since the current situation deprives companies of legal security as concerns the practice of tying within European competition law...|$|E
40|$|Microsoft’s {{case has}} led to heated debates, both in Europe and the United States of America, on the abuse of the {{dominant}} position and on the prohibition of tying. This discussion, both in Europe and the United States, is not finished. In this article the author presents legal implications of tying products in Europe and Poland and confronts them with the American approach to tying. In Poland, {{a country with a}} fast developing economy, with the growing level of foreign investments, discussion on monopolist practices under the conditions of a fast technological development 1 has not really commenced yet. The problems of innovation and development of New Economy undertakings has gained new impetus following Poland’s accession to the European Union. It is a matter of time when the anti-trust law begins to show interest in them. There are some indications that this has already taken place. In {{the first part of this}} article the author briefly presents the discussion related to Microsoft III case in the United States insofar as it pertains to New Economy issues. The second and third parts address legal and political aspects of the Microsoft case in the European Union. In the fourth part legal aspects related to <b>tying</b> <b>practices</b> in Poland are presented. The article aims to show that instrumental and mechanical treatment of <b>tying</b> <b>practices</b> used by firms having the market power under conditions of technological progress is not proper. The problem of antitrust analysis of such practices is universal, as universal as these practices are. However, the problem is solved differently in the United States and in Europe and the reasons for such a different approach are rooted in the legal system and policy enforcement. Microsoft antitrust is global. After US and European cases, Korean competition authority has found Microsoft guilty of <b>tying</b> <b>practices</b> 2. Regarding Microsoft problems with tying it is necessary to ask the question whether <b>tying</b> <b>practices</b> are characteristic only to enterprises like Microsoft or constitute a general problem from the New Economy perspective.

In this case the European Commission (Commission) applied a rule-of-reason approach {{for the first time to}} Microsoft’s <b>tying</b> <b>practice</b> and considered it to be anticompetitive. Microsoft tied its Windows Media Player (WMP) to its client operating system Windows and after a thorough analysis done by the Commission, Microsoft was considered to have abused its dominant position. In the past the Commission and the European Court of Justice used a per se illegality approach to tying practices and it was enough to establish that a company which applied the tying strategy was dominant in the tying product market. The hostile approach taken by the Commission and the ECJ has been criticized by economists mainly because tying is a commonly applied business strategy in the world economy and companies apply this be-cause of the economic efficiencies that this business strategy leads to. The efficiency gains are indirectly past on to the consumers in the form of product quality and innovation, reduced transaction costs and lower prices. It is argued that tying in fact increase consumer welfare. Economists would therefore rather see a per se legality approach or at least a rule-of-reason approach in the future. Due to the complexity of the Microsoft case, the Commission had to do a thorough analysis of the actual impact that the tying of WMP had on the market and the foreclosure effects that this strategy might lead to. This was therefore the first time that a rule-of-reason approach was applied on the matter of tying. However, after the Commission’s Decision of the Microsoft case there is still uncertainty in this matter. There is a strong need for future clarification. Microsoft Corporation has lodged an appeal against the Commission’s Decision with the European Court of Justice but it will take several years before the ECJ will be able to give a final judgement of the case. Until then the legal certainty is yet still very unclear...|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. January 2012. Major: Theatre Arts. Advisor: Dr. Sonja Kuftinec. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); v, 413 pages, appendices A-C. Theatre in Education (TIE) emerged in England in 1965 {{as a complex}} convergence of conditions that propelled theatre-based performance practices into school settings, ostensibly {{as a means for}} enabling radical educational transformation. However, as a set of <b>practices,</b> <b>TIE</b> exists within a set of contradictions, problematics, and occasional lack of reflexivity that can evacuate its potential for radicality. This historical and historiographic study explores the educational terrain in which TIE navigates, the conditions of its emergence and dissemination, and the narratives that frame its repertoire of practices in order to articulate the problems and problematics that make TIE a risky endeavor. Focusing on four aporias of TIE, the study asks if TIE is worth pursuing in the historical conditions of the United States and other nations in the 21 st century, particularly in school(ing) sites that employ high-stakes standardized testing as a Foucauldian form of discipline. The study then makes several proposals for directions TIE practitioners must consider if it is to remain relevant as a transformational practice of theatre and education, including a constant engagement with a postmodern notion of ethics, a focus on a Freirean critical performative pedagogy, and the consistent activation of ludic play and ludic space. While looking to numerous TIE programs that span the history of <b>TIE</b> <b>practices</b> for examples and critiques of the problems and potentials of <b>TIE’s</b> <b>practices</b> from a bricolage of critical lenses including performance studies, historiography, postcolonial theory, Foucauldian analysis of power relations, and critical pedagogies, critical analysis in this study is chiefly rooted in specific case studies, including Pow Wow (1973) and Homelands (1984) from Coventry Belgrade TIE, The Giant’s Embrace (2006), Pow Wow: The Power of the Circle (2005), and Living with Macbeth (2002) from Theatr Powys in Wales, With These Wings I Will … (2007) from the Creative Arts Team in New York, and Parry Jus’ Once (1998) from Arts-in-Action in Trinidad and Tobago...|$|R

We conclude that there are differences between the EC and US antitrust law on the choice of the relevant analogy for bundled rebates (predatory price standard or foreclosure standard) and the implementation of the distinct product and coercion test for <b>tying</b> <b>practices.</b> The second important difference between the two jurisdictions concerns the interpretation of the requirement of anticompetitive foreclosure. It seems to us that in Europe, consumer detriment is found easily and it is not always a requirement for the application of Article 82, or at least that the standard of proof of a consumer detriment for tying cases is lower than in the US. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the practice of "tying," which occurs when an underwriter lends to an issuer {{around the time of}} public securities offering in order to secure underwriting business. We examine the following questions: (i) How far do investment banks compete directly in tying? (ii) How does tying affect issuers, and in particular, their financing costs? (iii) Why do underwriters tie lending to underwriting? We find that investment banks engage in a substantial amount of tying, contrary to concerns that they are disadvantaged by <b>tying</b> <b>practices.</b> We find that tying allows firms to reduce their financing costs, as tied issuers receive lower underwriter fees on seasoned equity offerings and discounted loan yield spreads. These results are robust to matching methodology developed by Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1997, 1998). Lower financing costs are consistent with informational economies of scope from combining lending with underwriting. From the underwriters' perspective, we find that tying helps build relationships that augment an underwriter's expected investment banking revenues by increasing the probability of receiving both current and future equity underwriting busines...|$|R

40|$|Background: To improve {{efficiency}} and quality, {{a number of}} policies have recently been implemented to increase competition and cooperation within the health systems of many countries. We theorize how hospital performance, measured as productivity, is contingent upon network embeddedness, {{the extent to which}} a hospital is involved in a network of interconnected interorganizational relationships. Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore the effects on hospital productivity resulting from both collaborative network ties and competitive relationships between providers. Methodology: We used panel data collected between 2003 and 2007 from 35 hospitals in Abruzzo, one of the most populated regions of central Italy. We used secondary data of hospital activities regarding both clinical and administrative aspects. For each year, we examined the intensity of interhospital competition and the unique position each provider has within a larger network of relationships with other hospitals. Other idiosyncratic organizational characteristics were examined as well. Findings: Our results show that hospital productivity is negatively related to the degree of competition that a hospital faces and positively related to the degree with which hospitals establish collaborative relationships. We also found that the negative impact on hospital productivity due to competition was lessened when hospitals were more likely to create cooperative network <b>ties.</b> <b>Practice</b> Implications: Because interhospital collaboration and competition are related to hospital productivity, they should constitute a core element in the strategic planning of a hospital’s operation. Health administrators should implement policies that favor collaborative network ties at the regional level and mitigate interorganizational rivalries when establishing collaborative relationships with local competitors...|$|R

Na vanuagu, roughly translates in English to ‘my home/place’ is weightier than the contemporary meaning of an individual’s home or place. Indeed, it is the foundation of personhood, identity, knowledge and relationship with one’s surroundings. It is also the expression of relationships between individual persons, families, kin groups, clans, tribes, and neighbouring communities and islands. Na vanuagu is a reality that determines whether an individual is a close relative, a distant relative, an associate, an adopted person, a co-opted person, an outsider, a foreigner, a host or a guest. It is the basis of knowledge in Tathimboko. It defines and delineates aspects of personhood and includes notions of rights, privileges, duties, responsibilities and social status in both private and public domains. Personhood in Tathimboko is primarily understood in a communal context, although there is also an individual aspect to it. It is usually acquainted to social relations, communal living, family, kinship <b>ties,</b> <b>practices,</b> rights and privileges. Since this paper concentrates on a region of Guadalcanal, a number of concepts in the local vernacular with their ‘equivalent or approximate’ English translations are singled out and discussed.
