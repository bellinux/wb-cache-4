5|$|No. 1 Squadron (AFC) patrols {{found the}} Shunet Nimrin {{garrison}} {{still in place}} {{on the morning of}} 22 September, but Rujm el Oshir camp (to the east of Jericho, half way between the Jordan River and the Hedjaz railway) had been broken up, and fires burned west of the Amman railway station. Ain es Sir camp (south east of Es Salt, half way between the Jordan River and Amman) was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> Ottoman troops, but at about midday the Ottoman garrison at Es Salt was hastily packing. Australian airmen reported the whole area east of the Jordan to be on the move towards Amman by between 15:00 and 18:00, when two Bristol Fighters bombed a mass of traffic at Suweile, half-way between Es Salt and Amman, and fired nearly 1,000 machine-gun rounds.|$|E
5|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{was viewed as}} radical when first proposed, but additional evidence soon emerged. The boundary clay was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> minute spherules of rock, crystallized from droplets of molten rock formed by the impact. Shocked quartz and other minerals were also identified in the K–Pg boundary. Shocked minerals have their internal structure deformed, and are created by intense pressures such as those associated with nuclear blasts or meteorite impacts. The identification of giant tsunami beds along the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean also provided evidence for impact, and suggested that the impact may have occurred nearby—as did the discovery that the K–Pg boundary became thicker in the southern United States, with meter-thick beds of debris occurring in northern New Mexico.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} to come, Vysotsky's grave became a site of pilgrimage for several generations of his fans, the {{youngest}} of whom were born after his death. His tombstone also {{became the subject of}} controversy, as his widow had wished for a simple abstract slab, while his parents insisted on a realistic gilded statue. Although probably too solemn to have inspired Vysotsky himself, the statue is believed by some <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> metaphors and symbols reminiscent of the singer's life.|$|E
25|$|In April 1993, a young Navajo woman {{arrived at}} the Indian Medical Center {{emergency}} room in Gallup, New Mexico, complaining of flu-like symptoms and sudden, severe shortness of breath. Doctors found the woman’s lungs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> fluid. The young woman died soon after her arrival. An autopsy revealed the woman’s lung to be twice the normal weight for someone her age. The cause of her death could not be found, and the case was reported to the New Mexico Department of Health.|$|E

Additionally music concerts became more common - {{one of the first}} was directed by early Bahá'í Edward Kinney. Myron H. Phelps, as part of the transition of the Monsalvat School in his position as director in 1904 and 5 gave a talk on the religion at the 1904 conference following his 1903 book, (though it was later judged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> inaccuracies by the Bahá'ís.) Articles based on the work were printed in various journals, some noting Greenacre as well.|$|E

25|$|The naturalism of {{the figures}} {{suggests}} the artist's intention to elicit an immediate emotional response to the viewer. Neptune’s furrowed brow gives a sense of his fierce strength. His stance is set in stone, solidifying his divine power. In contrast, Triton looks somewhat submissive while he is grabbing Neptune’s thigh. His face looks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> anxiety as if {{he knows that he}} should obey whatever Neptune commands him to do. His timid nature and Neptune’s dominate presence display the reality of human emotion and brings back the point of Bernini’s plan to convey myths coming to life.|$|E

Finland came up with two wins to top the group and move on to the qualification round, along with Germany in second place and Denmark in third. The final match between the U.S. and Finland determined the United States' last-place finish, and they were sent to the relegation round {{for the first time since}} 2003.|$|E
25|$|Promoted to captain on 30 August 1688, Fairborne {{was given}} {{command of the}} fifth-rate HMS Richmond later that month. The fact {{that his mother had}} been left without a pension by the old regime is likely to have made Fairborne a {{supporter}} of the Glorious Revolution of November 1688. He transferred to the command of the fifth-rate HMS Phoenix in early 1689 and then commanded the third-rate HMS Warspite at the French victory at the Battle of Beachy Head in June 1690 during the Nine Years' War. After the battle the upper decks of the ship were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> Dutch musket balls.|$|E

She warns him against going down an alleyway, which turns out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> assassins from Dai-Nippon. The fight with the assassins spills over into Warburton's residence, where they are defeated. However, when they get there, Warburton has been {{critically}} injured by Ignatieff himself. Ignatieff has been joined by another IPS agent, Richard Allenby. Ignatieff and Allenby escape, and then Allenby uses his powers to summon the police. In order to help his friends escape, Narayan Singh stays behind to face the police. Allenby orders Singh taken to his own house for interrogation.|$|E
25|$|In 1812 he {{was sitting}} in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms, which he knew <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> mistakes, when the idea {{occurred}} to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery. The French government had produced several tables by a new method. Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables, half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages, and the work itself, which was restricted to addition and subtraction, was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes. Here, for the first time, mass production was applied to arithmetic, and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable.|$|E
25|$|In {{his history}} of the 32nd Armoured Regiment, Maurizio Parri wrote that a company of the II Medium Tank Battalion with its M11/39s had tried to {{counter-attack}} the British Matildas but the crews misunderstood flag signals, which caused delays and the attack failed. In 1944, Moorehead wrote that Maletti was wounded while rallying his men, then retreated to his tent with a machine-gun, where he was killed. Maletti's mortal remains were to be seen {{at the entrance of}} his tent when war correspondents visited the camp. Moorehead wrote that he saw unattended donkeys wandering around looking for water and soldiers looting extravagant Italian army uniforms and lunching on luxury foods, wines and Recoaro mineral water. New equipment, weapons and ammunition strewed the ground, already disappearing under the sand and dozens of dug-outs were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> food, new equipment and ammunition.|$|E

25|$|Four {{months after}} his run in Dubai, Heart's Cry {{appeared}} at Ascot Racecourse in England for Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Lemaire claimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> confidence before the race and Heart's Cry's participation attracted a large Japanese media contingent. Starting the 3/1 second favourite, he {{took the lead in}} the straight but was overtaken in the final furlong and finished third behind Hurricane Run and Electrocutionist. After his race at Ascot, Heart's Cry did not run again until the Japan Cup on 29 November. He started the 5.8/1 second favourite but ran disappointingly, finishing tenth of the eleven runners behind Deep Impact. After the race the Japan Racing Association announced that the horse had developed breathing problems which may have affected his performance, and his retirement was announced in early December.|$|E
500|$|In 1964, {{as well as}} {{recording}} four {{episodes of}} the radio show Housewives' Choice, Jacques starred in her own television series, Miss Adventure, as the private investigator Stacey Smith. Although Jacques wanted the series <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> suspense, the programmes were more comedic and she was disappointed with the results. In August that year she appeared as Madame Arcati in an ITV production of Blithe Spirit. The play's writer, Noël Coward, felt that [...] "finally someone had delivered a performance that wasn't overshadowed by Margaret Rutherford", who had originated the stage role in 1940 and played it in the 1945 film version.|$|E

Simon Price of The Independent commented the song borrows its electronic sound from Goldfrapp. Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times complimented Spears' delivery and the lyrics, saying the song is [...] "about the kind of girl power that's focused on besting one obnoxious man, is also [...] and contemporary at the same time– more feminism as individualism". Mike Newmark of PopMatters called the song [...] " [...] a meaty, high-voltage shuffler helmed by the Outsyders, who do an admirable job of recreating the chemistry of Spears and Danja on last year’s single 'Gimme More'".|$|E
500|$|MuuMuse's Bradley Stern {{described}} the video as [...] "an eye-popping 7-minute deep dive into astonishing new levels of self-importance and certifiable insanity." [...] The video was also noted as Gaga's most ambitious project since those for her previous singles [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and [...] "Telephone". Kevin Rutherford from Billboard said that Gaga [...] "has no problem attaching art to music" [...] and that [...] "she's not {{showing signs of}} stopping anytime soon with her new music video." [...] Isaiah Thomas from El Espectador noted that the video was a response by Gaga against accusations of [...] "selling out" [...] to the corporate world. Especially {{the ending of the}} video justified this with Gaga murdering the corporate heads who supposedly destroyed her freedom {{in the beginning of the}} video. Dharmic X from Complex {{described the}} release as [...] "vibrant" [...] and [...] "leftfield", as is expected from a release by Gaga.

500|$|Other reviewers were {{positive}} towards the way Boys Don't Cry portrayed its subject matter. and Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times listed Boys Don't Cry {{as one of}} the five best films of 1999, saying, [...] "this could have been a clinical movie of the week, but instead it's a sad song about a free spirit who tried to fly a little too close to the flame". Janet Maslin of The New York Times said the film was [...] "stunning" [...] and gave it four stars out of four stars. Maslin said, [...] "unlike most films about mind-numbing tragedy, this one manages <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> hope". Kenneth Turan of The Los Angeles Times praised the lack of romanticization and dramatization of the characters, and wrote, [...] "Peirce and Bienen and the expert cast engage us in the actuality of these rootless, hopeless, stoned-out lives without sentimentalizing or romanticizing them" [...] and that [...] "Boys Don't Cry is an exceptional—and exceptionally disturbing film". Mike Clarke of USA Today commended Peirce's depth of knowledge of the case and the subject matter, writing, [...] "Peirce seems to have researched her subject with grad-school-thesis intensity".|$|E
