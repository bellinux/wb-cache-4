40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find out if national culture impacts the phenomenon of power as it is found in teacher-student communication at the University of Jyväskylä. The study is pertinent and relevant because of the increasingly rapid internationalization that is happening in the Finnish higher education system. Understanding aspects of intercultural teacher-student communication will be important for the future. A qualitative research process was chosen for this study and the data was collected by conducting in-depth interviews with 10 international students. They were asked about their experiences, perceptions and feelings while communicating with Finnish professors. Analysis and interpretation of the data indicated that the cultural background of students did impact their expectancies and interpretation regarding teacher power. They experienced expectancy violations with respect to the unanticipated informality of Finnish professors characterized by informal methods of address, friendliness and an apparent lack of authority. The results were analyzed primarily by using Hofstede’s and Schwartz’s cultural dimensions, face negotiation theory and politeness theory by Brown & Levinson and Scollon & Scollon and with Expectancy Violations Theory by Burgoon. The overall conclusion is that the cultural differences between Finnish professors and international students do have an impact on power in teacher-student communication. Expectancy violations of this power led to negative feelings of frustration, disappointment and lack of motivation in the respondents. On the other hand, some of the respondents indicated that they also felt more comfortable with the Finnish system and <b>their</b> <b>expectations</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed...</b>|$|E

Library and Information Centers adopting various methodology for collection building, from print media to digital collection, from individual subscription to consortia based collaboration in order to saving budget, library automation for resource management, Web 2. 0 technology for information literacy and user education and other tools and technology such as audio visual methods, forum, emails, list-serves, and many more lists are added up during the time for ‘save the time of reader’, what S R Rangnathan’s philosophy reveal.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. At Loughborough University, the School of Civil and Building Engineering {{commissioned}} the Centre for Engineering and Design Education {{to undertake a}} longitudinal study, over four years, to explore issues associated with feedback on assignments from both the staff and student perspective. This study was prompted by low feedback scores on the National Student Survey* and initially explored the sources of students’ dissatisfaction with feedback and their perceptions of what constitutes feedback. In later years the study was broadened to explore how students use their feedback and the impediments to this. The findings of the study have influenced the feedback strategy and practice within the School with clear guidance given to staff, training provided to students {{and the introduction of}} enhanced feedback quality monitoring processes. This paper reports on the fourth year of the study, which goes full circle back to students’ perception of effective feedback. The fourth year of the study seeks to explore, from the student perspective, whether the <b>changes</b> made <b>have</b> addressed the original issues raised by the students, whether they are satisfied with the quality of the feedback they now get and whether <b>their</b> <b>expectations</b> regarding feedback <b>have</b> <b>changed.</b> The study uses a combination of focus group discussions, and questionnaires to gather data from second and third year students who have been impacted most by the feedback changes made within the School. This paper shares key findings from the study, including the impact that the practice <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> had on the general students’ understanding of feedback and the changes in level of expectation of feedback, particularly with respect to the most engaged students...|$|R

Consumers’ expectation can be predicted and observed {{with regard to}} beliefs and the reliability regarding products or services (Lee et al. 2014). For example, consumers who are dissatisfied with apparel products hold fewer expectation when exposed to negative word-of-mouth as well as exhibiting less repurchasing behavior with the product (Richins 1983). Also, consumers increasingly expect retail brands to behave in line with ethical fashion practices, because <b>their</b> <b>expectation</b> <b>has</b> formed a reference point for their evaluation of socially responsible business practices and eco-products to develop favorable or unfavorable attitude towards retail brands (Creyer and Ross 1997).|$|R
40|$|The authors {{explore the}} {{development}} of the Patients’ Expectations Questionnaire (PEQ) and examination of psychometric characteristics it encompasses by reviewing surveys of primary care and hospital outpatients before and after their clinic visit. Three scales were developed for Pre-visit Ideal and Realistic expectations, and Post-visit Experiences (met expectations), based on literature review, semi-structured interviews, and subsequently piloted and refined. Patients completed the questionnaire about their ideal and realistic expectations before they saw the doctor, and were asked if <b>their</b> <b>expectations</b> <b>had</b> been met afterwards. The results show the scales met acceptability criteria for reliability (Cronbach’s alphas exceeded ? 0. 70), administration mode (interview and self-completion), and sample type (general practice and hospital). Split-half reliability was also acceptable. Adjusted odds ratios showed that post-visit experiences (met expectations), followed by feelings of control in life, and age, were the most powerful independent predictors of overall patient satisfaction ratings with the clinic visit, and independent self-ratings of whether <b>their</b> <b>expectations</b> <b>had</b> been met overall. This leads the authors to conclude that the PEQ as a self-report instrument, has good reliability and validity and covers the main types of patient expectations of ambulatory health care. It has policy potential for monitoring expectation management, and is thus of potential benefit to providers and purchasers of health services, and ultimately to patients...|$|R

Because parents are now more educated, <b>their</b> <b>expectations</b> <b>have</b> also increased. The Marriage and Parenthood Study (2007) indicated that the key issue in placing children in childcare centres has to do with trust and reliability of childcare giver (70 %) followed by affordability, ability of caregiver to care and develop their child and the proximity of the centre to the home. It was also interesting to note that almost 8 in 10 married respondents surveyed wanted 2 to 3 children (MCYS Press Release, 2008).

Users of a variety of online discussion forums participated in this study. We hypothesized and found that participants who felt <b>their</b> <b>expectations</b> <b>had</b> been exceeded by the forum reported higher levels of forum identification.
