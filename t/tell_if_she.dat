5|$|As {{the episode}} ends, Olivia's {{hallucination}} of Peter points {{out to her}} {{that there is a}} way to <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is from the prime universe: by confirming her memories of her niece Ella, who did not survive birth in the parallel universe. During Olivia's final test in the tank, she is again able to cross over to the gift shop in the prime universe. She is able to recall Ella's phone number and calls her, but is brought back to the parallel universe shortly after Ella answers. As she is removed from the tank, she lies, telling Walternate the test did not work.|$|E
500|$|Monica Herrera of Billboard {{commented that}} the {{prevalent}} use of Auto-Tune on Kesha's vocals {{made it difficult to}} <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could actually sing, citing the song [...] "Take It Off" [...] as an example of [...] "how easily individuality can get lost in a sea of Auto-Tune". On the other hand, Herrera was impressed with the [...] "choruses that stick with the listener for days." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic was not impressed with the album's ballads, calling them [...] "completely unsatisfying." [...] However, he noted [...] "that with so many fun, 'Tik Tok'-type tracks, the album has plenty for both brats and the bratty at heart." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe believed that Kesha's [...] "personality is completely missing from ," [...] resulting in her sounding [...] "vapid and faceless." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine was extremely critical of the album and Kesha, saying that her attempts to sing and rap were [...] "pitiful", describing her as [...] "insincere" [...] and [...] "souless". Dave Simpson of The Guardian also questioned the honesty of her lyrics while comparing her unfavorably to Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, and Britney Spears.|$|E

50|$|Cory {{falls in}} love with Anna, the new girl at school. The only problem is that he can't <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> real: most of his friends have never seen her on campus, and she's not listed in the school's files. When he calls her family's home they are strange and evasive.|$|R

60|$|The {{examination}} was over, though I doubted if the Coroner {{was entirely}} satisfied with it. I think {{he suspected that}} Mary Cavendish could <b>tell</b> more <b>if</b> <b>she</b> chose.|$|R
5000|$|The {{final set}} of {{proposal}} strips showed Oola running afoul of Prince Crewth and Gaggot, here named Prince Grabstein and Rhune, when she petitions to leave [...] "dewdrop brigade" [...] {{and become a}} stand-up comedian. Unable to <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> laughing with him or at him, Grabstein outlaws laughter altogether and sets Luciano after Oola, only for the fly {{to fall in love}} with her. These situations were later recycled as part of the early Pibgorn story arcs.|$|R
60|$|CROFTS [not believing him] I know, of course, {{that you}} perhaps might feel bound not to <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had said {{anything}} to you. But it's very awkward to be uncertain about it now that we shall be meeting the girl every day. We don't exactly know how we ought to feel towards her.|$|E
60|$|There is {{a bridge}} across the water {{at the top of}} Airey Force, which is perhaps one of the prettiest spots in the whole of our Lake country. The entire party on their arrival of course went up to the bridge, and then the entire party of course descended. How it {{happened}} that {{in the course of the}} afternoon George and Emily were there again, and were there unattended, who can <b>tell?</b> <b>If</b> <b>she</b> had meant to be cautious, she must very much have changed her plans in allowing herself to be led thither. And as he stood there, with no eye resting on them, his arm was round her waist and she was pressed to his side.|$|E
60|$|From Woodstock the Commissioners removed unto Euelme, {{and some}} of them {{returned}} to Woodstock the Sunday se'nnight after, (the book of Valuations wanting something that was for haste left imperfect,) but lodged not in any of those rooms where they had lain before, and yet were not unvisited (as they confess themselves) by the devil, whom they called their nightly guest; Captain Crook came not untill Tuesday night, and how he sped that night the gate-keeper's wife can <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> dareth, but what she hath whispered to her gossips, shall not be made a part of this our narrative, nor many more particulars which have fallen from the Commissioners themselves and their servants to other persons; they are all or most of them alive, and may add to it when they please, and surely have not a better way to be revenged of him who troubled them, than according to the proverb, tell truth and shame the devil.|$|E

5000|$|Aduba's {{portrayal}} of the character Crazy Eyes has led to extensive acclaim. According to Tom Meltzer of The Guardian, [...] "Shakespeare-quoting loner 'Crazy Eyes' invites pity, shock, reproach and belly-laughs in equal measure." [...] The Huffington Post Canada entertainment editor Chris Jancelewicz, noted that after the first six episodes of season two, he was impressed by this appropriately nicknamed character: [...] "Girl is crazy, and Aduba is genuinely frightening in the role. You can't <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> harmless or secretly plotting Piper's death".|$|R
60|$|He {{himself was}} in for it at any rate. He should have Morgan on his hands again indefinitely; though indeed he saw the lad had a private theory to produce which would be {{intended}} to smooth this down. He was obliged to him for it in advance; but the suggested amendment didn’t keep his heart rather from sinking, {{any more than it}} prevented him from accepting the prospect on the spot, with some confidence moreover that he should do so even better if he could have a little supper. Mrs. Moreen threw out more hints about the changes that were to be looked for, but she was such a mixture of smiles and shudders—she confessed she was very nervous—that he couldn’t <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were in high feather or only in hysterics. If the family was really at last going to pieces why shouldn’t she recognise the necessity of pitching Morgan into some sort of lifeboat? This presumption was fostered {{by the fact that they}} were established in luxurious quarters in the capital of pleasure; that was exactly where they naturally would be established in view of going to pieces. Moreover didn’t she mention that Mr. Moreen and the others were enjoying themselves at the opera with Mr. Granger, and wasn’t that also precisely where one would look for them on the eve of a smash? Pemberton gathered that Mr. Granger was a rich vacant American—a big bill with a flourishy heading and no items; so that one of Paula’s “ideas” was probably that this time she hadn’t missed fire—by which straight shot indeed she would have shattered the general cohesion. And if the cohesion was to crumble what would become of poor Pemberton? He felt quite enough bound up with them to figure to his alarm as a dislodged block in the edifice.|$|E
60|$|She flushed a little, {{embarrassed by}} the passion in his tone. His letters {{had told me that}} he was very much in love with his wife, and I saw that he could hardly take his eyes off her. I could not <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> loved him. Poor pantaloon, he was not an object to excite love, but the smile in her eyes was affectionate, and it was {{possible}} that her reserve concealed a very deep feeling. She was not the ravishing creature that his love-sick fancy saw, but she had a grave comeliness. She was rather tall, and her gray dress, simple and quite well-cut, did not hide the fact that her figure was beautiful. It was a figure that might have appealed more to the sculptor than to the costumier. Her hair, brown and abundant, was plainly done, her face was very pale, and her features were good without being distinguished. She had quiet gray eyes. She just missed being beautiful, and in missing it was not even pretty. But when Stroeve spoke of Chardin it was not without reason, and she reminded me curiously of that pleasant housewife in her mob-cap and apron whom the great painter has immortalised. I could imagine her sedately busy among her pots and pans, making a ritual of her household duties, so that they acquired a moral significance; I did not suppose that she was clever or could ever be amusing, but there was something in her grave intentness which excited my interest. Her reserve was not without mystery. I wondered why she had married Dirk Stroeve. Though she was English, I could not exactly place her, and it was not obvious from what rank in society she sprang, what had been her upbringing, or how she had lived before her marriage. She was very silent, but when she spoke it was with a pleasant voice, and her manners were natural.|$|E
50|$|Nicaea {{conceived}} Telete {{from this}} union; after her daughter’s birth, Nicaea attempted to hang herself. Although surviving stories do not <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> made any further suicide attempts, she did {{live to see}} Aura, another nymph impregnated by Dionysus in the same manner, going into labor and giving birth to Iacchus, as described in Nonnus’s Dionysiaca.|$|E

5000|$|... "Anamika, please stop," [...] {{she whispered}} urgently.If she really didn't {{want me to}} she could scream or move away or kick me. [...] "You're beautiful," [...] I said as I slid my hand between her thighs where her bloomers should have been. She closed her eyes again, but this time I couldn't <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was enjoying it or not. I pushed with my finger. I wasn't slow, the way I had been with India and Rani. I was afraid if I was too gentle she would use it to move away. I used all the force I could muster.She let out a howl. [...] "Stop, it hurts."I pulled back and said, [...] "I just fucked you." [...] There was blood on my finger. (Chapter xviii) ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{military}} psychiatrist Bill Turner (Michael Dudikoff) {{falls for}} a general's daughter, a dark conspiracy threatens to swallow up everyone involved. Turner's {{relationship with his}} new patient, Marine sergeant Randi Stewart (Brooke Theiss), begins to reach well beyond the typical doctor/patient bond, as he soon discovers that she {{is involved in a}} far-stretching political conspiracy but can't <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is the victim or the perpetrator. Randi's brother, Gordon Stewart is running for political office when their father General Stewart (Dan Hedaya) is murdered and Randi becomes the main suspect. When Turner's feelings toward Randi grow he has to deal with her being a possible murderer. But Turner would more than anything not find out, which leads him getting sucked deeper and deeper into the [...] "Quicksand".|$|E

60|$|When {{the girls}} had perched {{themselves}} on any available article of furniture, they waited with respectful eagerness, while Sally retired to the hall for a moment, and Julia rolled her eyes, with her finger on her lips, looking as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could <b>tell</b> much <b>if</b> <b>she</b> dared.|$|R
50|$|Lucy is a happy-to-go {{personality}} {{and not one}} to hide anything; she's all too willing to shout her love to Seiji, who is somewhat put off by her actions. It is really hard to <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is truly in love with Seiji or if she only likes him because his actions resemble that of samurai, her idols. It {{is shown in the}} manga that she is athletic (which is noticed during the big race, where she is going faster than Ayase while doing back-flips). During her first appearance, after Seiji saves her luggage from a biker, she is eating while wearing a biker outfit, which she wears because either she considers them relaxing clothes or she rides her own motorcycle. She also has a childhood friend named Daniel McBain, whom she does not like due to his conceitedness. She also begins a relationship with Miyahara; however, despite this, she still has an affection for Sawamura, even {{going so far as to}} jump on him whenever they meet, often in front of a shocked and subsequently depressed Miyahara.|$|E

40|$|This {{narrative}} {{describes the}} author s experience of revealing her sexual orientation {{as a social}} work student, clinician, and professor.
