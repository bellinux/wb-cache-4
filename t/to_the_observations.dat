5|$|Father Secchi {{produced}} {{some of the}} first color illustrations of Mars in 1863. He used the names of famous explorers for the distinct features. In 1869, he observed two dark linear features on the surface that he referred to as canali, which is Italian for 'channels' or 'grooves'. In 1867, English astronomer Richard A. Proctor created a more detailed map of Mars based on the 1864 drawings of English astronomer William R. Dawes. Proctor named the various lighter or darker features after astronomers, past and present, who had contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>observations</b> of Mars. During the same decade, comparable maps and nomenclature were produced by the French astronomer Camille Flammarion and the English astronomer Nathan Green.|$|E
5|$|In an {{alternative}} scenario, the exozodiacal dust may be generated in an outer belt that is orbiting between 55 and 90AU from Epsilon Eridani {{and has an}} assumed mass of 10−3 times the mass of Earth. This dust is then transported inward past the orbit of Epsilon Eridani b. When collisions between the dust grains are taken into account, the dust will reproduce the observed infrared spectrum and brightness. Outside the radius of ice sublimation, located beyond 10AU from Epsilon Eridani where the temperatures fall below 100K, the best fit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>observations</b> occurs when a mix of ice and silicate dust is assumed. Inside this radius, the dust must consist of silicate grains that lack volatiles.|$|E

According to government laws as of September 2006, it was mandatory for all gas and petrol stations in the city to close-down from 22:00–05:00 as a cost-saving measure. Hence he was forced to seek refuge near the international press personnel until it was possible for him to move out, as a result of which he was able to capture most of the event as it unfolded.|$|E
25|$|After {{feeling the}} draft of wind in the tunnel on that Levanter day in December 1997, the Gibraltar Caving Group had pushed aside some {{corrugated}} metal sheets, and found a bricked-in area of the wall. Carefully removing some bricks, they soon revealed a doorway behind the bricked-in area of the tunnel. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>observations</b> posts, including a concrete slab for that on the west, the men found {{the remains of a}} bicycle. They also located the tubing which sheathed the aerial rod along the stairs. Cork tiles on the floor provided insulation for purposes of both warmth and sound. They were in two patterns and shapes: square tiles arranged around the periphery of the room, presumably to indicate storage areas, and narrow tiles in a herringbone pattern in the main area of the room centrally. During the course of a 28-minute documentary that was filmed and produced in 1998, the team turned on the brass tap over the wash pit supplied by the 10,000 gallon water tank. The water, while initially black, soon ran clear. The men kept the location of the cave a secret for three months while they researched it. The documentary, Operation Tracer – Stay Behind Cave, was published in April 2012 (link to documentary below).|$|E

500|$|Ben Nevis has a {{highland}} (alpine) maritime (oceanic) Polar climate (ET {{climate in}} Köppen's classification). Ben Nevis's altitude, maritime location and topography frequently lead to cool and cloudy weather conditions, which can pose {{a danger to}} ill-equipped walkers. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>observations</b> carried out at the summit observatory from 1883–1904, fog was present on the summit for almost 80% of the time between November and January, and 55% {{of the time in}} May and June. The average winter temperature was around , and the mean monthly temperature for the year was [...] In an average year the summit sees 261gales, and receives [...] of rainfall, compared to only [...] in nearby Fort William, [...] in Inverness and [...] in London. Rainfall on Ben Nevis is about twice as high in the winter {{as it is in the}} spring and summer. Snow can be found on the mountain almost all year round, particularly in the gullies of the north face– with the higher reaches of Observatory Gully holding snow until September most years and sometimes until the new snows of the following season.|$|E
40|$|Mirror neurons are a {{distinct}} class of neurons that discharge both during {{the execution of}} a motor act and during <b>observation</b> of <b>the</b> same or similar motor act performed by another individual. However, <b>the</b> extent <b>to</b> which mirror neurons coding a motor act with a specific goal (e. g., grasping) might also respond <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>observation</b> of a motor act having the same goal, but achieved with artificial effectors, is not yet established. In the present study, we addressed this issue by recording mirror neurons from the ventral premotor cortex (area F 5) of two monkeys trained to grasp objects with pliers. Neuron activity was recorded during <b>the</b> <b>observation</b> and execution of grasping performed with the hand, with pliers and during observation of an experimenter spearing food with a stick. The results showed that virtually all neurons responding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>observation</b> of hand grasping also responded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>observation</b> of grasping with pliers and, many of them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>observation</b> of spearing with a stick. However, the intensity and pattern of the response differed among conditions. Hand grasping <b>observation</b> determined <b>the</b> earliest and the strongest discharge, while pliers grasping and spearing observation triggered weaker responses at longer latencies. We conclude that F 5 grasping mirror neurons respond <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>observation</b> {{of a family of}} stimuli leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same goal. However, the response pattern depends upon the similarity between the observed motor act and the one executed by the hand, the natural motor template...|$|R

2500|$|So {{that the}} distractions {{of a busy}} life should not {{interfere}} with Head's introspective analysis, {{it was decided that}} the experimentation should take place in Rivers's rooms. Here, as Head states, [...] "for five happy years we worked together on week-ends and holidays in the quiet atmosphere of his rooms at St. John's College." [...] In the normal course of events, Head would travel to Cambridge on Saturday, after spending several hours on the outpatient department of the London Hospital. On these occasions, however, he would find that he was simply too exhausted to work on the Saturday evening so experimentation would have to be withheld until the Sunday. If, therefore, a long series of tests were to be carried out, Head would come to Cambridge on the Friday, returning to London on Monday morning. At some points, usually during Rivers's vacation period, longer periods could be devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>observations.</b> Between the date of the operation and their last sitting on 13 December 1907, 167days were devoted to the investigation.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{hypotheses}} of {{extraterrestrial intelligence}} (ETI) and extradimensional intelligence (EDI), Hynek continued, [...] "There is sufficient evidence to defend both". As {{evidence for the}} ETI hypothesis, he mentioned the cases involving radar as good evidence of something solid, {{as well as the}} cases of physical evidence. Then he turned to defending the EDI hypothesis: in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>observations</b> of materialization and dematerialization, he cited the [...] "poltergeist" [...] phenomenon experienced by some people after a close encounter; the photographs of UFOs, sometimes in only one frame, and not seen by witnesses; the changing of form in front of witnesses; the puzzling question of telepathic communication; that in close encounters of the third kind, the creatures seem to be at home in Earth's gravity and atmosphere; the sudden stillness {{in the presence of the}} craft; levitation of cars or people; and the development by some of psychic abilities after an encounter. [...] "Do we have two aspects of one phenomenon or two different sets of phenomena?" [...] Hynek asked.|$|E
2500|$|McLuhan met Corinne Lewis (1912–2008) in St. Louis, {{a teacher}} and {{aspiring}} actress from Fort Worth, Texas, and they were married on August 4, 1939. They spent 1939–40 in Cambridge, where he completed his master's degree (awarded in January 1940) and began {{to work on his}} doctoral dissertation on Thomas Nashe and the verbal arts. While the McLuhans were in England, war had broken out in Europe. For this reason, he obtained permission to complete and submit his dissertation from the United States, without having to return to Cambridge for an oral defence. In 1940, the McLuhans returned to Saint Louis University, where he continued teaching and they started a family. He was awarded a Ph.D. in December 1943. [...] He next taught at Assumption College in Windsor, Ontario from 1944 to 1946, then moved to Toronto in 1946 where he joined the faculty of St. Michael's College, a Catholic college of the University of Toronto. Hugh Kenner was one of his students and Canadian economist and communications scholar Harold Innis was a university colleague who had a strong influence on his work.
