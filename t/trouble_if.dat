5|$|On 15 August, Lin {{issued an}} edict that {{prevented}} {{the sale of}} food to the British. Chinese labourers working for the British in Macao were withdrawn the next day. War junks arrived in coves along the Pearl River and notices above the fresh water springs warned that they were poisoned. On 24 August, the Portuguese Governor of Macao, Don Adraio Accacio da Silveira Pinto, announced that the Chinese had ordered him to expel the British from the colony. He warned Lancelot Dent of the British hong Dent & Co. that the Chinese planned to seize the British dwellings in Macao. On 25 August, former Superintendent John Astell proposed to Elliot that all British boats should evacuate to Hong Kong. By {{the end of the}} month, 2,000 people in over 60 ships were in Hong Kong harbour without fresh food or water. The ships held European merchants, lascars, and dozens of British families. The 28-gun frigate Volage of Captain Henry Smith sailed to Hong Kong on 30 August. Smith was an old friend of Elliot from their service in the West Indies Station. Elliot warned Kowloon officials that there was bound to be <b>trouble</b> <b>if</b> the embargo continued against the merchant fleet.|$|E

25|$|Using an {{emergency}} number recognized by a GSM phone like 112 instead of another emergency number may be advantageous, since GSM phones and networks give special priority to emergency calls. A phone dialing {{an emergency}} service number not recognized by it may refuse to roam onto another network, leading to <b>trouble</b> <b>if</b> {{there is no}} access to the home network. Dialing a known emergency number like 112 forces the phone to try the call with any available network.|$|E

25|$|He {{was sent}} to the Maze in April 1997. He demanded and was granted an LVF section in C and D wings of H-block 6 (H6) for himself and 26 fellow inmates. INLA prisoners were housed in the A and B wings, and the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP, the {{political}} wing of the INLA) warned there would be <b>trouble</b> <b>if</b> the prisoners were not kept segregated. In August 1997, LVF prisoners, led by Wright, rioted over their visiting accommodation in the Maze.|$|E
25|$|At one point, Garrett and his {{followers}} rounded up 30 head of cattle bearing Bogan's brand, stating they were stolen, whereas Bogan claimed they were mavericks. Bogan approached lawyer H. H. Wallace, who demanded that Oldham County, Texas officials pay $25,000 in damages, and fearing Bogan might have a case, the county settled for $800. By the fall of that year, indictments had been handed down against 159 cowboys, Bogan being one, and Garrett and his men set out to round them up. Garrett, however, did not disguise his movements, as he did want to avoid <b>trouble</b> <b>if</b> possible and would be satisfied if the cowboys merely left.|$|E
25|$|The {{journalist}} who {{reported on the}} event believed that most people who turned up for the meeting were not actually interested in votes for women at all, but had instead come to witness any <b>trouble</b> <b>if</b> there was any. The only violence {{on the day of}} the Dartford meeting, however, was a stone which was thrown at the wagon from a neighbouring backyard, but no damage was caused. At the end of the speech, Florence Conybeare invited Councillor W.H.D. King to give the vote of thanks. He said that he felt ashamed that he had the vote while they did not, but thanked the party for recognising Dartford as a place of importance worth visiting.|$|E

25|$|After Sun Yi's death, Sun He, a {{relative}} of Sun Quan's family, came to Wanling County (宛陵縣; present-day Xuancheng, Anhui), the capital of Danyang Commandery, to restore order. He blamed Gai Lan and Dai Yuan for Sun Yi's murder {{but was unable to}} exert control over the military forces in the commandery. Gai Lan and Dai Yuan became worried because Sun He, who had no blood relations with Sun Yi, was already so upset over Sun Yi's death. They believed that they would be in deeper <b>trouble</b> <b>if</b> Sun Quan (Sun Yi's brother) personally came to Danyang to pursue the matter, so they murdered Sun He as well. They then sent a messenger to Liu Fu, the Inspector (刺史) of Yang Province, and expressed their willingness to defect to Liu's side.|$|E
25|$|At the temple, {{the group}} {{encounters}} the remaining {{members of the}} Others who have taken refuge, including Flight 815 stewardess Cindy (Kimberley Joseph) and the two abducted children, Zack and Emma, who have been missing since they were taken in by the Others. The survivors are captured and brought before two men, Dogen (Hiroyuki Sanada), a Japanese man, and his translator, Lennon (John Hawkes). Hurley tells them that Jacob sent him, and offers the guitar case as proof. Inside is a wooden ankh, which Dogen breaks open, revealing a note that tells the Others they will all be in <b>trouble</b> <b>if</b> Sayid dies. Sayid is brought to a spring, noted to have gone murky, where he is held underwater until the time of an hourglass passes. Jack administers CPR, but Sayid does not respond. They believe Sayid has died. Sawyer and Miles are brought into the temple, having been captured after burying Juliet. Dogen questions Hurley in a separate room, where Hurley reveals Jacob is dead. Shocked by this news, the Others sound an alarm, prepare their defenses, and send fireworks into the air in preparation for an attack. Lennon insists on speaking with Jack privately. Jack refuses, leading to an altercation, when suddenly Sayid comes back to life.|$|E

When he returns, Marge tells him their marriage {{is in serious}} <b>trouble</b> <b>if</b> he values fishing more than her. To prove his love for her, he lets the fish (still alive) go and they return home. Once home, Marge congratulates Grampa on how clean the house is, to which he reveals his secret is [...] "pretending to cry". Grampa laughs as he reveals to a shocked Bart and Lisa that he tricked them as he leaves, and Bart swears he will never trust an old person again. At the bait shop, General Sherman is still uncaught, but tales are told of a near-mythical figure who almost succeeded: [...] "Went {{by the name of}} Homer. Seven feet tall he was, with arms like tree trunks. His eyes were like steel: cold, hard. Had a shock of hair, red, like the fires of Hell." ...|$|E

500|$|Artist V. Jeevananthan {{compared}} Aval Appadithan {{to other}} films whose central theme was women, such as Charulata (1964), Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), and Panchagni (1986), while also labelling them as [...] "classics {{that put the}} spotlight on women." [...] Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, in their book Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, say the film was also inspired by the 1972 film, Dhakam, which starred R. Muthuraman and Pandari Bai. They also note that Aval Appadithan uses a [...] "fluid narrative style" [...] and music to mix flashbacks with vox-pop and [...] "glossy pictorialism". The film is an exception on stereotypes of women, as shown by paralleling an independent woman, Manju, and a pious traditional woman: Manju gets into problems while Arun's wife is happy. The last lines of the film where Manju asks [...] "what {{do you think of}} 'women's liberation'", [...] Arun's wife answers, [...] "I don't know", [...] to which Manju says [...] "that is why you are happy", send the message that one will inevitably get into <b>trouble</b> <b>if</b> one exhibits assertive behaviour.|$|E
500|$|Romeo begs Friar Lawrence, a sea otter, to wed them. After some thought, the friar {{believes}} {{their marriage}} {{will end the}} feud between their families, and agrees. Romeo and Juliet are wed that morning and traverse the sea in their happiness. However, even the other sea and land animals strongly oppose their being together. A fish finds them a lovely couple, but warns them {{that they will be}} in big <b>trouble</b> <b>if</b> the Prince finds out. Back on the beach, Mercutio is telling many jokes, which leads to him making insulting jokes against the Capulets, and the Prince is headed in that direction. When he arrives, Mercutio mocks him as well. Romeo rushes to aid his friend, but after a struggle Mercutio falls off the cliff where Juliet met Romeo the previous evening, and everyone thinks that he is dead. The Prince, jealous of Juliet's affection for Romeo, exiles Romeo to Shark Island. In despair, Juliet seeks the Friar's help, and he gives her a potion to put her in a deathlike state. Mercutio is revealed to be alive and sees the whole thing, remarking, [...] "What a tangled web we weave." ...|$|E

2500|$|The day after, I {{asked my}} pilot, a cheerful young New Zealander, {{if he thought}} we really needed an escort. He said that, unless we had bad luck, he could {{probably}} get away from anything except a very up-to-date fighter. [...] I {{asked him if he}} would get into <b>trouble</b> <b>if</b> we went without an escort. He replied cheerfully that, if we came back safely, no one would say anything, and if we didn't, it wouldn't matter anyway. This seemed sound enough logic, and so we sent off a signal to Robin, announcing our arrival, and set off on our own.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{the union}} is in the field its members can keep it from growing if they know how, and our man knows how. Meetings can be set far apart. A {{contract}} can at once be entered into with the employer, covering a long period, and made very easy in its terms. However, these tactics may not be good, and the union spirit may be so strong that a big organization cannot be prevented. In this case our man turns extremely radical. He asks for unreasonable things and keeps the union embroiled in <b>trouble.</b> <b>If</b> a strike comes, {{he will be the}} loudest man in the bunch, and will counsel violence and get somebody in trouble.

[...] Johnny Behan testified that he tried to prevent the confrontation. I [...] "told them...I was down there for the purpose of disarming the Clantons and McLaurys.

[...] He said Cowboys had put up their hands or thrown open their coats to show they weren't armed, and that Doc Holliday had fired first.

2500|$|In 1987, Kramer was the {{catalyst}} {{in the founding}} of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), a direct action protest organization that chose government agencies and corporations as targets to publicize lack of treatment and funding for people with AIDS. ACT UP was formed at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Services Center in New York City. Kramer was asked to speak as part of a rotating speaker series, and his well-attended speech focused on action to fight AIDS. He began by having two-thirds of the room stand up, and told them they would be dead in five years. Kramer reiterated the points introduced in his essay [...] "1,112 and Counting": [...] "If my speech tonight doesn't scare the shit out of you, we're in real <b>trouble.</b> <b>If</b> what you're hearing doesn't rouse you to anger, fury, rage, and action, gay men will have no future here on earth.
