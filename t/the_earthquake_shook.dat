6000|$|... [212] Dr. Donne, {{the celebrated}} Dean of St. Paul's, had {{recently}} published a thesis, {{to prove that}} suicide, under some circumstances, was justifiable. Hopeful answers all his arguments, and proves {{it to be the}} foulest of murders. Bunyan, in his treatise on Justification, volume 1, page 314, thus notices the jailer's intent to commit suicide, when the doors of the prison in which Paul was confined were thrown open-"Even now, while <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> <b>shook</b> the prison, he had murder in his heart-murder, I say, and that of a high nature, even to have killed his own body and soul at once"-(ED).|$|E
6000|$|In {{all this}} {{relation}} {{here is not}} aught that can justify the jailer. For, 1. His whole life was idolatry, cruelty, and enmity to God. Yea, 2. Even now, while <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> <b>shook</b> the prison, he had murder in his heart--yea, and in his intentions too; murder, I say, and that of a high nature, even to have killed his own body and soul at once.[19] Well, 3. When he began to shake under the fears of everlasting burnings, yet then his heart was wrapped up in ignorance as to the way of salvation by Jesus Christ: 'What must I do to be saved?' He knew not what; no, not he. His condition, then, was this: he neither had righteousness to save him, nor knew he how to get it. Now, what was Paul's answer? Why, 'Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,' look for righteousness in Christ, 'and then thou shalt be saved.' This, then, still holdeth true, 'men are justified from the curse, {{in the sight of}} God, whilst sinners in themselves.' ...|$|E
50|$|High-magnitude ocean waves {{propagate}} at {{high speeds}} close to 25 meters per second, which meant that they traversed the 55-kilometer distance from the epicenter to Gavo in less than 20 minutes.

30|$|Gender and {{age were}} found to be {{correlated}} with risk perception. Specifically, men (r = − 0.10 /− 0.13) and older people (r =  0.15 / 0.16) were more likely to regard a Natech accident as a threat to their lives or property before the quake and just after <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> <b>shaking.</b> However, younger households felt more threaten by the Natech accident when they perceived its occurrence (r = − 0.17). In addition, the results also show that long-term residents had higher risk perception levels in terms of perceived likelihood just after <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> <b>shaking</b> (r =  0.10).|$|R

5000|$|A {{total of}} about 50,000 houses and over 50 temples were either {{destroyed}} by <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> <b>shaking</b> or subsequent fires. [...] The area burned down in Edo was about 2.3 km2.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>earthquake</b> <b>shaking</b> caused {{moderately}} severe damage, VIII on the Mercalli scale. The tsunami reached Okushiri between 2 and 7 {{minutes after}} <b>the</b> <b>earthquake.</b> A tsunami warning was given 5 minutes after <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> by <b>the</b> JMA. However, {{this was too}} late for the inhabitants of Okushiri. The quake caused fires to start in the town of Okushiri, adding greatly to the total damage.|$|R
50|$|Much of <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> {{damage was}} due to soil liquefaction, causing the {{collapse}} of houses {{and a number of}} road and rail accidents. The degree of liquefaction was the worst seen in Japan since <b>the</b> 1964 Niigata <b>earthquake.</b> <b>The</b> greatest effects were observed in areas underlain by loose Holocene aeolian and fluvial sands. Four people were killed by the effects of <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> <b>shaking.</b>|$|R
50|$|On March 11, 2011, the Great East Japan {{earthquake}} greatly {{affected the}} area. <b>The</b> <b>earthquake</b> <b>shook</b> {{large sections of}} Hamadōri with an intensity of shindo 6+, the second-highest level on the scale. Furthermore, a massive tsunami hit and flooded the coast. The combination of the powerful earthquake and subsequent tsunami resulted in both large-scale loss of life and massive damage to property and infrastructure. Notably, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant was heavily damaged by the tsunami, leading to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.|$|E
5000|$|On August 12, 2014 a {{magnitude}} 5.1 earthquake struck Ecuador 22 km west-southwest of Cayambe {{at a depth}} of 11.9 km. <b>The</b> <b>earthquake</b> <b>shook</b> Ecuador's capitol Quito 32 km away causing large dust clouds and prompting the temporary shutdown of Quito's Mariscal Sucre International Airport. [...] The earthquake killed at least 4 people including two men who were buried by a landslide in a local quarry. It also injured at least 8 others. Earthquakes are commonplace in Ecuador because of its position along the [...] "Ring of Fire," [...] an area of high seismic activity that encircles the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

30|$|To {{reproduce}} the landslide propagation, 3 D numerical simulation was conducted using the SPH model. The landslide mass, Aso Bridge and boundary were discretized {{into a series}} of SPH particles with a diameter of 7  m. The representative volume of each particle is the third power of the diameter, 343  m 3 in this case. The landslide particles were evenly spaced with an initial velocity of 0  m/s in the source area. The number of particles along depth is dependent on the depth of the sliding surface, and varies in different position. Note that the source area, the depth of the sliding surface, and the volume of the landslide mass could be estimated according to the topographical maps before and after <b>the</b> <b>earthquake.</b> <b>The</b> <b>earthquake</b> <b>shake</b> {{is one of the key}} factors influencing the initiation of landslides. However, this work aims to analyze the post-failure of the landslide mass. During the propagation of the landslides, it is difficult to make sure whether <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> <b>shake</b> still continues or not. Therefore, to simplify the calculation, the ground motion due to <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> was not included in the simulation of the landslide propagation.|$|R
30|$|Households {{were also}} more likely to {{evacuate}} after perceiving the Natech accident if: (1) they thought it very likely that their lives or property were threatened by the Natech accident before the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami and just after <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> shaking; and (2) they considered that the Natech would affect their lives and property to a very great extent just after <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> <b>shaking</b> and when they perceived it.|$|R
5000|$|Religious BeliefsCountry superstar Paul Brandt interviewed Callaway on his website, asking [...] "Do {{you care}} to share your {{religious}} beliefs?

25|$|One {{positive}} {{aspect of}} soil liquefaction is {{the tendency for}} <b>the</b> effects of <b>earthquake</b> <b>shaking</b> to be significantly damped (reduced) {{for the remainder of}} <b>the</b> <b>earthquake.</b> This is because liquids do not support a shear stress and so once the soil liquefies due to <b>shaking,</b> subsequent <b>earthquake</b> <b>shaking</b> (transferred through ground by shear waves) is not transferred to buildings at the ground surface.|$|R
