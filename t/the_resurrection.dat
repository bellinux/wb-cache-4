5|$|The {{description}} {{provided by}} Blake to Humphrey {{explains that the}} work depicts <b>the</b> <b>resurrection.</b> The top of the work depicts Christ on the Throne of Judgement with Heaven opened up across the painting. Behind Christ are the heads of infants which represent creation coming from Jesus. Christ is surrounded by the four Zoas and seven angels that have vials filled with God's wrath. An image of a tabernacle with a cross inside is depicted above Christ. An image of baptism is to Christ's right and the Last Supper is to Christ's left with both representing eternal life. Further to Christ's right is <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> of the just {{and to the left}} is <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> and subsequent fall of the wicked. Adam and Eve are below Christ, and Abraham and Moses are nearby. Below Moses is Satan wrapped by the Serpent and in the centre is the book of death. At the top is the book of life, and the Christian Church is the figure of a woman on top of the moon.|$|E
5|$|After Voldemort's death, Harry {{uses the}} Elder Wand to repair his {{original}} broken wand, saying {{he will return}} the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's tomb where its power may vanish if Harry dies undefeated and it may drop out of history. Harry {{does not intend to}} search for <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> Stone he dropped in the forest, but will keep the Invisibility Cloak he inherited. The wizarding world returns to peace once more.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the biblical}} scenes painted inside the Church of St Demetrius are the Ascension of Jesus, which adorns the altar vault, {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> of Lazarus and the Transfiguration of Jesus, which {{decorate}} the vault left of the apse. Images {{of a number of}} saints have also been preserved, including these of the patron saint Demetrius, Saint George riding a white horse, Saint Achillius of Larissa and Saint Nicholas.|$|E
5|$|Hermione {{identifies}} in Dumbledore's book {{a strange}} symbol also worn {{at the wedding}} by Xenophilius Lovegood. They visit him and are told the symbol represents the mythical Deathly Hallows, three objects from an old fairy tale titled The Tale of the Three Brothers: the Elder Wand, an unbeatable wand; <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> Stone, able to summon the dead; and an infallible Invisibility Cloak. Harry realises Voldemort is seeking (and later successfully obtains) the Elder Wand, won by Dumbledore after Grindelwald's defeat, believing it {{will allow him to}} overpower the connection between his own wand and Harry's. Harry also recognises <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> Stone as that found by Dumbledore which later become the second Hallow, and believes it to be hidden inside the Snitch Dumbledore left for him, but can't open it. The description of the third Hallow also matches that of his own inherited Invisibility Cloak.|$|E
5|$|In 1751, Francis Blomefield, in his Collectanea Cantabrigiensia, {{recorded}} StJames' {{as having}} a square tower, with four bells and a clock. The north aisle was leaded {{and there was a}} chantry chapel at the east end with a screen. He concludes this to be the Chancel of <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection.</b> At this time, the south aisle, nave and chancel were also recorded as leaded.|$|E

5|$|In 1864 Ge {{returned}} to Florence and would paint not only Herzen's portrait {{but also the}} Messengers of <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> and {{the first version of}} the Christ on the Mount of Olives. The new religious paintings at that time were not much of a success, and the Imperial Academy refused to exhibit them in its annual exhibition.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Thornton {{announced}} <b>The</b> <b>Resurrection</b> of Dr. Octagon, {{a proposed}} sequel to Dr. Octagonecologyst that would reintroduce the character. Los Angeles-based producer Fanatik J {{was chosen to}} create the music for the album. Thornton himself {{took part in the}} production of early material for the project, playing bass, guitar, and keyboards on many of the tracks.|$|E

5|$|Production of the Mellotron ceased in 1986, but it regained {{popularity}} in the 1990s, and was used by several notable bands. This led to <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> of the original manufacturer, Streetly Electronics. In 2007, Streetly produced the M4000, which combined {{the layout of the}} M400 with the bank selection of earlier models.|$|E
5|$|St. Rynagh's Church {{houses a}} {{work by the}} {{well-known}} German sculptor, Imogen Stuart, called The Madonna and Child, a mandorla carved in 1974.

5|$|The {{expansion}} Rise of the Zilart {{reveals that}} the Crystal War and <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> of the Shadow Lord had been masterminded by the Zilart princes Eald'Narche and Kam'lanaut, who survived the extinction of their race. The two Zilarts plan to become Gods by opening the path to paradise, and the player is charged with thwarting their plans.|$|E

5|$|The manner {{with which}} van der Weyden {{presents}} <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> {{of the dead}} across the five lower panels is reminiscent of a Gothic tympanum, specifically that at Autun Cathedral. Rolin would have been familiar with the Autun Cathedral entrances, which may have motivated his decision to commission a Last Judgement for the hospice from van der Weyden.|$|E
5|$|Varaha symbolizes <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> of {{the earth}} from a pralaya (dissolution of the universe) and the {{establishment}} of a new kalpa (aeon). Symbolism also attributes that evolution from water could relate to the geological phenomenon of the tectonic age. It could also represent the rescue of earth from “false cults”.|$|E
5|$|After disbanding, {{all four}} members of Bauhaus {{undertook}} various solo projects before Ash, David J and Kevin Haskins reformed as Love and Rockets in 1985. Bauhaus reformed for <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> Tour in 1998 and for a one-off concert in April 2005. Another reunion tour followed {{towards the end of}} 2005, before work started on a new album Go Away White, released in March 2008. The album charted poorly, only reaching No. 120 on the UK Albums Chart, but gave the band their first entry for a studio album on the U.S. Billboard 200 when it reached No. 105. Following the release of the album, Bauhaus disbanded again.|$|E

5|$|Church {{belief in}} <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> {{of the body}} led to a {{prohibition}} against cremation that was pastorally modified at the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s under limited circumstances, but those conditions have been largely ignored even by the clergy. According to the Catechism, burial of the dead is a corporal work of mercy that must treat the body with respect and love (e.g. scattering of cremated remains, burial in an unmarked grave, etc. are forbidden in the Catholic Church). Organ donation after death and organ transplants under certain terms, also autopsies for legal and scientific reasons are permitted.|$|E
5|$|Denning made {{sweeping}} {{changes to the}} Common Law, with <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> of equitable estoppel and his reform of divorce law. A common misconception {{is that most of}} his judgments were overturned in the House of Lords; many were, including the expansion to the doctrine of fundamental breach he set out in Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd, but they let many judgments stand and on occasion agreed with his judgment in situations where he dissented, such as in his final case George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd in 1983.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Thornton {{introduced}} {{the character of}} Dr. Dooom on the album First Come, First Served (1999). The album featured a track in which the character murdered Dr. Octagon. In 2002, Thornton announced <b>The</b> <b>Resurrection</b> of Dr. Octagon, a proposed sequel to Dr. Octagonecologyst that would reintroduce the character. The resulting album, The Return of Dr. Octagon released in 2006, was largely produced without Thornton's involvement, based upon three completed vocal tracks and reconstructed outtakes. Thornton later produced Dr. Dooom 2 in response to The Return of Dr. Octagon.|$|E
