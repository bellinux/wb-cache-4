5|$|The Governor of Oklahoma Brad Henry {{declared}} a State of Emergency in 17counties {{and described the}} outbreak as the worst natural disaster he had seen since becoming governor. On February 15, President Obama approved Henry's request for federal assistance in Carter, Logan and Oklahoma counties. A disaster recovery center {{was set up by}} the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on February20. Homeowners were allowed <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> $200,000 to repair damages to their home or find a temporary or permanent shelter. They were also allowed <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> up to $40,000 to replace lost property. Businesses were allowed <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> up to $2million for damage repair, property loss, and economic loss. By February23, about $781,000 had been given in federal grants. On February 25, FEMA approved Governor Henry's request for public assistance in Carter, Coal and Love counties. The estimated cost to clear the 7,000 tons of debris in Lone Grove was placed at $500,000, of which $90,000 has been paid for by FEMA. The Department of Homeland Security offered to assist with the reconstruction of homes and businesses and to support those who were left homeless. President Barack Obama passed along his condolences and best wishes to the victims of the tornado.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving into}} the Kirchherr family's house, Sutcliffe used <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> her clothes, as he was the same height as Kirchherr. He wore her leather pants and jackets, collarless jackets, {{oversized}} shirts, and long scarves. He also borrowed a corduroy suit with no lapels that he wore on stage, which prompted Lennon to sarcastically ask if his mother had lent him the suit.|$|E
5|$|In October 1927, Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was {{accepted}} for publication by Century, and Marquis was prompted to take down his medical practice sign. However, this was premature, {{as it would be}} some time before royalties were forthcoming. Lack of funds drove Marquis to continue seeing patients and carrying out insurance medical examinations. He also needed <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> money from relatives and cash in his war risk insurance policy. Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was published in April 1928 and received good reviews.|$|E

5|$|While the {{majority}} of Great Southern's activity was {{in the sale of}} managed investment schemes, in 2007 it diversified into funds management through the purchase of Rural Funds Management Ltd, retaining its diversified agricultural assets fund and offering a new share fund and a blended property fund. In addition to retailing MIS products to investors, Great Southern also provided loans to investors wanting <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> to invest. By 2009 its loan book comprised 14,500 loans with an average value of approximately A$50,000.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began on}} the canal in 1763. When water was let into {{the first section of}} the canal in 1764 the side walls of a lock chamber collapsed. Zacharie had <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> money to continue. In 1766, to satisfy his creditors, he prematurely opened the canal. The water broke the banks and the {{participants}} in the ceremony had to scramble to escape. Work was halted with the canal reaching only to Saint-Romain-en-Gier. In 1768, Zacharie died penniless of a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|A statewide {{referendum}} on the ballot that day continued the work begun by the new city charter in asking voters to consolidate {{the city and county}} governments in Philadelphia. In 1854, all of the municipalities in Philadelphia County had been consolidated into one city, but many county offices still existed, duplicating the efforts of city officials. The merger would also bring county offices under the civil service protections of the new city charter. Merging the city and county governments had been defeated in a 1937 referendum, but in 1951 the question was overwhelmingly approved. Two other ballot proposals authorized the city <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> $17 million for municipal improvements and $14 million for the gas works; both passed by a five-to-one margin.|$|E

5|$|After {{the first}} Brazilian dreadnought, Minas Geraes, was launched, the Brazilian {{government}} began an extended campaign {{to remove the}} third dreadnought from the contract because of political—backlash from the Revolt of the Lash coupled with warming relations with Argentina—and economic reasons. After much negotiating and attempts from Armstrong to hold the Brazilian government to the contract, the Brazilians relented, {{due in part to}} lower bond rates that made it possible for the government <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> the necessary money. Rio de Janeiro was laid down {{for the first time in}} March 1910.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{decides to}} invest in pumpkins, but loses his entire investment. Late on a {{mortgage}} payment and short on money, he tries <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> some, but to no avail. Homer keeps his money troubles secret from Marge. Meanwhile, Patty and Selma have received a promotion at the DMV. As a last resort, Homer asks the two if they will lend him the money, and they agree {{on the condition that}} he become their loyal servant. Marge finds out about the loan after she sees the IOU note, and her sisters tell her what happened.|$|E
5|$|In 1270 Roger Bigod, the 5th Earl, {{inherited}} the castle and undertook extensive renovations there whilst living in considerable luxury and style. Although still extremely wealthy, the Bigods were now having <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> increasing sums from first the Jewish community at Bungay and then, after {{the expulsion of}} the Jews, Italian merchants; {{by the end of}} the century, Roger was heavily in debt to Edward I as well. As a result, Roger led the baronial opposition to Edward's request for additional taxes and support for his French wars. Edward responded by seizing Roger's lands and only releasing them on the condition that Roger granted them to the Crown after his death. Roger agreed and Framlingham Castle passed to the Crown on his death in 1306.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Chia mooted {{the idea}} that Singaporeans should be able <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> from their own Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings to tide over periods of {{financial}} difficulty. His rationale was that if individuals could borrow from their own CPF accounts to buy depreciating property and money-losing stocks, {{there was no reason}} why they {{should not be allowed to}} do so to pay for bills. Dr. Ong Seh Hong, MP for Aljunied GRC, opposed the view, stating that it was important and for the good of Singapore that Singaporeans were independent individuals who could assume the risks and successes of their investments and be self-sufficient.|$|E
5|$|In December 1994, Alan Parker {{signed on}} to write and direct the film after being {{approached}} by Stigwood and Vajna. Parker also produced the film, with his Dirty Hands Productions banner enlisted as a production company. While drafting his own script, Parker researched Eva's life, compiling newspaper articles, documentaries and English-language books. He refused <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> elements from Stone's script or the stage play, instead opting to model his script after Rice and Lloyd Webber's concept album. Stone had a falling out with Parker over {{the content of the}} script, claiming that he had made significant contributions. A legal dispute and arbitration by the Writers Guild of America resulted in Parker and Stone sharing a screenwriting credit.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its offices in Illinois, the company had branch offices in Baltimore, Buffalo, Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis, New York City, Omaha, St. Louis, San Francisco and Seattle, all of which closed when Oliver shifted to mail order sales in March 1917. A minor recession in 1921–22 caused {{a large number of}} customers to default on their payments, resulting in the repossession of their typewriters. The company opted not <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> money and, in 1926, the board of directors voted to liquidate the company. Only one employee, Chester Nelson, was retained to oversee the company's liquidation.|$|E

5|$|In {{domestic}} matters, Scott advocated increased {{salaries for}} public officials, economic development measures, and heavy punishments for persistent criminals. While he desired a tax code that would preclude {{the need for}} the state <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> money, he encouraged legislators to keep taxes as low as possible. He also urged them to convert the militia into a youth army. The General Assembly routinely ignored his calls for reform but did pass a measure he advocated that allowed debtors a one-year stay on collection of their debts if they provided both bond and security.|$|E
5|$|In {{multiple}} steps during 2012–2013, the ECB {{lowered its}} bank rate to historical lows, reaching 0.25% in November 2013. Soon after the rates were shaved to 0.15%, then on 4 September 2014 {{the central bank}} shocked financial markets by cutting the razor-thin rates by a further two thirds from 0.15% to 0.05%, the lowest on record. The moves were designed to make it cheaper for banks <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> from the ECB, with the aim that lower cost of money would {{be passed on to}} businesses taking out loans, boosting investment in the economy. The lowered borrowing rates caused the euro to fall in relation to other currencies, which it was hoped would boost exports from the eurozone.|$|E
5|$|In {{the most}} celebrated episode of the Vita Sancti Paternus, King Arthur tries to steal St Padarn's tunic. King Arthur covets Padarn's tunic, and when he is refused, stamps the earth, at which Padarn calls on the earth to swallow him; it does so. Arthur has to beg {{forgiveness}} before he is released. This seems <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> {{the story of a}} different Padarn, Padarn Redcoat, whose coat was one of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain (Tri Thlws ar Ddeg Ynys Prydain). This story takes place about a century before Saint Padarn; it is, however, important because of the link drawn between Saint Padarn and the Romano-British King Arthur, the legendary British leader of the late fifth and early sixth centuries.|$|E
