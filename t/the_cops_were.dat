500|$|Musial was {{assigned}} to the Class AA Columbus Red Birds to begin 1941, though manager, Burt Shotton, and Musial himself quickly realized that the previous year's injury had considerably weakened his arm. He was reassigned to the Class C Springfield Cardinals as a full-time outfielder, and he later credited manager Ollie Vanek for displaying confidence in his hitting ability. During 87 games with Springfield, Musial hit a league-leading [...]379 before being promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. He was noted for his unique batting stance, a crouch in which his back was seemingly square to the pitcher. This stance was later described by pitcher Ted Lyons as [...] "a kid peeking around the corner to see if <b>the</b> <b>cops</b> <b>were</b> coming". According to a 1950 description by author Tom Meany, [...] "The bent knees and the crouch give him the appearance of a coiled spring, although most pitchers {{think of him as a}} coiled rattlesnake." [...] Musial continued to play well in Rochester—in one three-game stretch, he had 11 hits. He was called up to the Cardinals for the last two weeks of the 1941 season.|$|E
500|$|The Tactical Patrol Force (TPF) of the New York City Police Department {{arrived to}} free the police trapped inside the Stonewall. One officer's eye was cut, {{and a few others}} were bruised from being struck by flying debris. Bob Kohler, who was walking his dog by the Stonewall that night, saw the TPF arrive: [...] "I had been in enough riots to know the fun was over... <b>The</b> <b>cops</b> <b>were</b> totally humiliated. This never, ever happened. They were angrier than I guess they had ever been, because {{everybody}} else had rioted... but the fairies were not supposed to riot... no group had ever forced cops to retreat before, so the anger was just enormous. I mean, they wanted to kill." [...] With larger numbers, police detained anyone they could and put them in patrol wagons to go to jail, though Inspector Pine recalled, [...] "Fights erupted with the transvestites, who wouldn't go into the patrol wagon." [...] His recollection was corroborated by another witness across the street who said, [...] "All I could see about who was fighting was that it was transvestites and they were fighting furiously." ...|$|E
500|$|The police {{tried to}} {{restrain}} {{some of the}} crowd, and knocked a few people down, which incited bystanders even more. Some of those handcuffed in the wagon escaped when police left them unattended (deliberately, according to some witnesses). As the crowd tried to overturn the police wagon, two police cars and the wagon—with a few slashed tires—left immediately, with Inspector Pine urging them to return as soon as possible. The commotion attracted more people who learned what was happening. Someone in the crowd declared that the bar had been raided because [...] "they didn't pay off the cops", to which someone else yelled [...] "Let's pay them off!" [...] Coins sailed through the air towards the police as the crowd shouted [...] "Pigs!" [...] and [...] "Faggot cops!" [...] Beer cans were thrown and the police lashed out, dispersing some of the crowd who found a construction site nearby with stacks of bricks. The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600people, grabbed several people, including folk singer Dave Van Ronk—who had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: [...] "As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me, and that's why I stayed in... Every time you turned around <b>the</b> <b>cops</b> <b>were</b> pulling some outrage or another." [...] Ten police officers—including two policewomen—barricaded themselves, Van Ronk, Howard Smith (a writer for The Village Voice), and several handcuffed detainees inside the Stonewall Inn for their own safety.|$|E

60|$|It was on Thursday {{evening that}} Cork's {{seclusion}} became intolerable to him. Never a hart panted for water fountain {{as he did}} for the cool touch of a drifting stein, for the firm security of a foot-rail {{in the hollow of}} his shoe and the quiet, hearty challenges of friendship and repartee along and across the shining bars. But he must avoid the district where he was known. <b>The</b> <b>cops</b> <b>were</b> looking for him everywhere, for news was scarce, and the newspapers were harping again on the failure of the police to suppress the gangs. If they got him before Corrigan came back, the big white finger could not be uplifted; it would be too late then.

I got {{fourteen}} days without the option, because you see--well, the fact is, I'd done it before, and been warned. Bobby was a first offender and had the option; but the dear boy had no money left and wouldnt give you away by telling his name; and anyhow he couldnt have brought himself to buy himself off and leave me there; so hes doing his time. Well, it was two forty shillingses; and Ive only twenty-eight shillings in the world. If I pawn my clothes I shant be able to earn any more. So I cant pay the fine and get him out; but if youll stand 3 pounds I'll stand one; and thatll do it. If youd like to be very kind and nice you could pay the lot; but I cant deny that it was my fault; so I wont press you.|$|E
