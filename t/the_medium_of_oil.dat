25|$|From about 1450, {{with the}} arrival in Italy of the Flemish painter Rogier van der Weyden and {{possibly}} earlier, artists were introduced to <b>the</b> <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> paint. Whereas both tempera and fresco lent themselves to the depiction of pattern, neither presented a successful way to represent natural textures realistically. The highly flexibly medium of oils, which could be made opaque or transparent, and allowed alteration and additions for days after it had been laid down, opened a new world of possibility to Italian artists.|$|E
25|$|Van Eyck {{used the}} {{technique}} of applying layer after layer of thin translucent glazes to create a painting with an intensity of both tone and colour. The glowing colours also help to highlight the realism, and to show the material wealth and opulence of Arnolfini's world. Van Eyck {{took advantage of the}} longer drying time of oil paint, compared to tempera, to blend colours by painting wet-in-wet to achieve subtle variations in light and shade to heighten the illusion of three-dimensional forms. <b>The</b> <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> paint also permitted van Eyck to capture surface appearance and distinguish textures precisely. He also rendered the effects of both direct and diffuse light by showing the light from the window on the left reflected by various surfaces. It has been suggested that he used a magnifying glass in order to paint the minute details such as the individual highlights on each of the amber beads hanging beside the mirror.|$|E

5000|$|Henderson's {{painting}} style transitioned {{greatly from}} {{his early days}} favouring <b>the</b> <b>mediums</b> <b>of</b> <b>Oil</b> on Canvas; Oil on Paper; Watercolour; Gouache; Charcoal; Acrylic; Vitreous Enamel, using calligraphy in much of his work. His early vividly coloured geometric patterns were in the abstract contemporary style of the period. From the early 1980's his style developed into lyrical abstraction. Later with the transition to landscape scenes, typically of the Irish borders and coast, many layers of paint are used to build depth into each picture. In reference to these paintings Henderson says, [...] "In my paintings {{the time of day}} is indeterminable, the weather changeable, something has happened or is about to happen".|$|R

His exposure in the west came {{when he won the}} first prize in the Vienna Art Exhibition in 1873. Varma's paintings were also sent to the World's Columbian Exposition held in Chicago in 1893 and his work was awarded two gold medals. He is considered the first of the modernists, and, along with Amrita Sher-gil (1913-1941), the main exponents of Western techniques to develop a new aesthetic in the subjective interpretation of Indian culture with [...] "the promise <b>of</b> materiality in <b>the</b> <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>oils</b> and <b>the</b> reality-paradigm of the mirror/window format of easel painting".

50|$|He became {{interested}} in art {{at a young age}} and received his earliest artistic training, aged 10, under Dwardu Zammit, who introduced him to <b>the</b> <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> painting. In 1936 he started attending the Malta Government School of Art studying under Vincent Apap, Edward Caruana Dingli, Carmelo Mangion and Carmel Attard Cassar. This was briefly interrupted by the war when he was conscripted with the 2nd Regiment, King's Own Malta Regiment, however Camilleri continued to attend lessons, where possible, till 1947.|$|E
50|$|He {{graduated}} from Odessa State Art School in 1955, class of Dina Frumina and worked mainly in <b>the</b> <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil,</b> {{in his own}} picturesque manner, based on the coloristic nature of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. Some experts distinguish this artist first and foremost for his special gift of portrait painting. However, the major part of his paintings belongs to the genre of plein air (marine, urban and village) landscape which was a traditional genre of the South Russian School (Odessa School) of Painting.|$|E
5000|$|Although one of {{the first}} to settle in the Newlyn artists' colony Newlyn School, Langley {{initially}} benefited little from its growing fame, partly because of his working-class origins and partly because until 1892 he painted largely in watercolour rather than <b>the</b> more prestigious <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>oils.</b> His early training in lithography gives his paintings a detail and texture that show his technical skills.|$|R

5000|$|The Founding of the Nation {{was hailed}} as one <b>of</b> the {{greatest}} <b>oil</b> paintings ever by a Chinese artist by reviewers in that country, and more than 500,000 reproductions were sold in three months. Mao's praise helped boost the painting and its painter. Dong's techniques were seen as bridging the gap between <b>the</b> elitist <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> painting and popular art, and as a boost to Jiang's position that realistic art could be politically desirable. It was reproduced in primary and secondary school textbooks. The painting appeared {{on the front page}} of People's Daily in September 1953, and became an officially approved interior decoration. One English-language magazine published by the Chinese government for distribution abroad showed a model family in a modern apartment, with a large poster of The Founding of the Nation on the wall. According to Chang-Tai Hung, the painting [...] "became a celebrated propaganda piece".|$|R
5000|$|In {{terms of}} {{technique}} {{his work is}} at times traditional and at times highly original. Alivandi's early paintings, including those from the 1980s, use <b>the</b> now-traditional <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> on canvas, yet his aesthetic style, which recalls the stained glass of medieval churches, is highly personal. During the 1990s Alivandi continued to work in oils, but abandoned the traditional canvas, choosing instead to apply his paints directly to newspaper; a method pioneered by the cubists in the early 1900s.Since circa 2000, he increasingly works with the angelique pointillage technique (as seen in {{the image on the}} right), a unique method of painting with extremely small dots of ink which are then covered with a layer of veneer to lock and intensify the colours. This innovative pointillist technique has resulted in the many striking works that demonstrate the beauty of his composition and the power of his vision. According to one critic, his masterful blending of hues has earned him the title [...] "the magician of colours".|$|R
50|$|Wawro {{worked in}} <b>the</b> unusual <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> wax <b>oil</b> crayon, specialising in landscapes and seascapes that were {{acclaimed}} for their highly detailed and dramatic images of intense depth and colour. He used no models, but drew from images seen only once, {{such as in}} books or on television; his phenomenal memory enabled him to recall where he drew each picture and to date it precisely in his mind. Although possessing perfect recall, he often added his own touches to the images. He was particularly inspired by light, and the tones he used to capture light and shadows are considered masterly.|$|R
50|$|Using {{traditional}} forms and materials, Reza Abbasi (1565 - 1635) introduced new subjects to Persian painting—semi-nude women, youth, lovers. His painting and calligraphic style influenced Iranian artists {{for much of}} the Safavid period, which {{came to be known as}} the Isfahan school. Increased contact with distant cultures in the 17th century, especially Europe, provided a boost of inspiration to Iranian artists who adopted modeling, foreshortening, spatial recession, and <b>the</b> <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> painting (Shah Abbas II sent Muhammad Zaman to study in Rome). The epic Shahnameh ("Book of Kings"), a stellar example of manuscript illumination and calligraphy, was made during Shah Tahmasp's reign. (This book was written by Ferdousi in 1000 AD for Sultan Mahmood Ghaznawi) Another manuscript is the Khamsa by Nizami executed 1539-43 by Aqa Mirak and his school in Isfahan.|$|E

5000|$|Kush {{predominantly}} {{works in}} <b>the</b> <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> painting on canvas or board, {{with many of}} the original paintings also sold as limited edition giclée-on-canvas prints. His bronze-colored sculptures are small-scale and usually based on imagery from his paintings, such as Walnut of Eden and Pros and Cons. Although his style is frequently described as surrealist, Kush himself refers to it as [...] "metaphorical realism" [...] and cites the early influence on his style of Salvador Dalí's surrealist paintings as well as landscapes by the German romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich. Another influence on his work has been the 16th century Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch, known for his fantastic imagery and sometimes characterised as [...] "the pre-Surrealism Surrealist". Wings, ships, and color-saturated seascapes are frequent themes in his paintings, exemplified in the companion pieces, Arrival of the Flower Ship and Departure of the Winged Ship. Flowing water is another recurrent theme, exemplified by Breach and Current. Other works such as Three Graces and African Sonata merge human and animal forms with inanimate objects.|$|E
5000|$|Massurrealism is a {{development}} of surrealism {{that emphasizes the}} effect of technology and mass media on contemporary surrealist imagery. James Seehafer who is credited with coining the term in 1992 {{said that he was}} prompted to do so because there was no extant definition to accurately characterize the type of work he was doing, which combined elements of surrealism and mass media, the latter consisting of technology and pop art - [...] "a form of technology art." [...] He had begun his work by using a shopping cart, which [...] "represented American mass-consumerism that fuels mass-media", and then incorporated collages of colour photocopies and spray paint with <b>the</b> artist's traditional <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> paint.|$|R

Enrichment <b>of</b> <b>medium</b> with <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> refinery waste resulted in a 7.5 - 8.5 -fold greater concentration of glycolipids in comparison to <b>the</b> <b>medium</b> without addition <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> refinery waste. (Reis et al. 2004) investigated the production of biosurfactant by Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 using commercial sugar, sugarcane juice and cane molasses, sugarcane juice alcohol stillage, glycerol, mannitol, and soybean oil. Lower surface tension and higher emulsification indexes were achieved, indicating the feasibility to produce biosurfactants from a renewable and low-cost carbon source.|$|R
40|$|The project {{develops}} alternate {{forms of}} {{representation of the}} female body in <b>the</b> <b>mediums</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> and digital print. Representations of the body are central to contemporary art practice. Yet there are cogent arguments coming from feminist cultural theory that, in general women's bodies, and particularly the nude, cannot be portrayed other than through forms of representation that expose them to the male gaze. This poses a significant problem for women artists wishing to employ imagery of the female body. The project has explored alternative ways of depicting the female body; ways, which disrupt ocular-centric forms of representation that privilege the spectator by posing the body as displayed object. The following observations provided the background for this project: within contemporary approaches to representing the female body there is a marked shift away from the figuration of the external body; its depiction occurs less frequently within two-dimensional media; and, its prepositions tend to be of a less subjective nature. The project has sought to redress these shortfalls by seeking to re-vision the female body in two-dimensional painting and print-media. It has investigated alternatives to the symbolic body, enshrined within conventional pictures of female nudes, through explorations into embodied subjectivity - the specificities of lived, female experiences. Pictorially these impressions are representational, but the tactile dimensions of imagery, suggested through material surface quality, evoke a palpable sensuality that disrupts stereotypical patterns of looking. The relationship between tactility {{and the sense of}} touch dissolves the psychological and physical distance between the viewer and the picture. Pictorially, the representational framework varied from fragmented and cropped imagery of the female torso to direct illusionistic representations of the whole body. The outcomes of the research project, in the form of digital prints produced within the final phase, were chosen for exhibition. Initial investigations required the plasticity of paint media to convey the materiality of the imagery but advances, within both digital image layering processes and printing techniques resulted in a shift towards digital prints as principal output. The exhibition is, however, inclusive of key works, both prints and paintings, illuminating major developmental points encountered {{in the course of the}} project. The written exegesis includes documentation of practical and conceptual inquiries, together with an exploration of the underlying themes of the project placed in context through discussion of both historical and contemporary art...|$|R
