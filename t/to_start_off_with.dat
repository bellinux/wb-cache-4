25|$|An {{application}} was sent the government, {{at the time}} Mowinckel's Third Cabinet, with {{a proposal for a}} ten-year concessions using land planes. Routes were <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> a five-month service, and gradually increase to a full-year service from 1940. The company stated that it needed NOK500,000 annually in support from the state and Norway Post for the service. In 1933, the brothers Viggo Widerøe and Arild Widerøe—who would found Widerøe in 1934—also applied for routes in the same areas, but using sea planes on the route from Oslo via Kristiansand and Stavanger to Haugesund. Also Norske Luftruter applied, but a three-year concession was granted to Widerøe. The government stated that no airports had been built yet, and would not be in the immediate future, so it was better to start with sea plane services.|$|E

At the beginning, most students simply fail to appreciate the need for doing this. Accordingly, the real number system is introduced as an ordered field with the least-upper-bound property, and a few interesting applications of this property are quickly made. However, Dedekind's construction is not omitted. It is now in an Appendix to Chapter 1, where it may be studied and enjoyed whenever the time is ripe." [...] (p. ix) ...|$|E

500|$|The {{island has}} been {{structured}} {{to provide a}} fair mix of puzzle solving, exploration, and narrative elements while avoiding a [...] "paradox of choice" [...] by giving the player too much freedom and not knowing where to go next. According to artist Luis Antonio, {{one of the first}} things that Blow wanted the player to see was the mountain to make them aware as this being their ultimate goal. The game initially started the player in an abandoned bunker converted to living space, but as it was originally arranged, the player would exit the bunker not facing the mountain. Though they attempted to move and rotate the bunker space around to meet Blow's goal, it was ultimately scrapped in favor of a simpler space with interior elements that fit with other portions of the game, and which the player would climb out into the external environment with the mountain in full view. This introductory area was also meant to serve as the game's tutorial, helping players to understand fundamental mechanics of one must switch between solving puzzles and exploring the environment to find others, and Thekla spent a great detail of time fine-tuning the details to be clear without verbal explanation. The team's artists worked to support Blow's objective of guiding the player by using contrasts of color and of natural and man-made structures to highlight areas that the player would be drawn towards. Blow wanted the game's art <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> bright colors and high saturation, to present a type of optimism to the player, while later settings in the game would become less bright. He also wanted to make sure all elements of the game world stood out to avoid visual noise within the game that may have interfered with puzzle solving. To accomplish this, he and his team often had to review the game as if they were a new player to it, and identify what elements they were visually drawn to; this would often identify features of the island they had incorporated early on but were no longer appropriate for the final game.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1980s, the IRA in East Tyrone {{and other}} areas close to the border, such as South Armagh, were {{following}} a Maoist military theory devised for Ireland by Jim Lynagh, a high-profile member of the IRA in East Tyrone (but a native of County Monaghan). The theory involved creating [...] "no-go zones" [...] that the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) did not control and gradually expanding them. Lynagh's strategy was <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> one area which the British military did not control, preferably a republican stronghold such as east Tyrone. The South Armagh area {{was considered to be}} a liberated zone already, since British troops and the RUC could not use the roads there for fear of roadside bombs and long-range harassing fire. Thus it was from there that the IRA East Tyrone Brigade attacks were launched, with most of them occurring in east Tyrone in areas close to south Armagh, which offered good escape routes. The first phase of Lynagh's plan to drive out the British security forces from east Tyrone involved destroying isolated rural police stations and then intimidating or killing any building contractors who were employed to rebuild them. Lynagh's plans met strong criticism from senior brigade member Kevin McKenna, who regarded the strategy as [...] "too impractical, too ambitious, and not sustainable" [...] per journalist Ed Moloney. The IRA Northern Command, however, approved a scaled-down version of the strategy, aimed at hampering the repair and refurbishment of British security bases. Scottish-born journalist Kevin Toolis has written that from 1985 onward, the brigade led a five-year campaign that left 33 security facilities destroyed and nearly 100 seriously damaged.|$|E

50|$|One can {{structure}} retainage {{arrangements in}} any number of ways. Subject to state statutory requirements, 10% is the retainage amount most often used by contracting parties. Another approach is <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> a 10% retainage and to reduce it to 5% once the project is 50% complete. A third approach is to carve out material costs from a withholding requirement on the theory that suppliers, unlike subcontractors, may not accept retainage provisions in their purchase orders.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to give a {{comprehensive}} discussion of the four main approaches <b>to</b> budgeting, <b>starting</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> line item budgeting, program and performance budgeting, planning programming budgeting system and zero-base budgeting. The discussion covers the history, concept, procedures, advantages and disadvantages of each specified approach. The motivation behind this discussion was to seek a better understanding and familiarity with each of the various approaches to budgeting. None of them, however, can be regarded as a complete solution to budget problems. Each approach carries both strengths and weaknesses and thus cannot be applied indiscriminately to any given situation or financial environment. A solution for any budget problem depends on the nature of the organization affected and hence would require a thorough assessment of its operating environment before being carried out...|$|R
