A quantitative research approach was conducted to get a better understanding of the issues. The empirical data was collected from sixteen <b>Tejarat</b> <b>bank</b> (A famous governmental bank in Iran) branches in seven different cities (classified in to four zones) of Iran by the means of questionnaires.
