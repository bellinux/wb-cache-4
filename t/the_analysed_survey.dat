40|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1992, {{in order to do}} away with the ruins of the old communist system once and for all, radical economic reforms [...] 'shock therapy' [...] were introduced in Russia. However, there are winners and losers in the Russian transition from communism to market economy and democracy. The aim of the study is to investigate whether there are educational differences in self-rated health among the citizens of Taganrog in 1993 - 94. If there are indeed differences, the second aim is to investigate whether they can be explained by variations in specific social, economic and psychological circumstances, which are known to be affected by the present social and economic transformation in Russia. <b>The</b> <b>analysed</b> <b>survey</b> was carried out in a middle-sized Russian city, Taganrog, in late 1993 and early 1994. It was conducted by means of face-to-face interviews, with a sampling frame consisting of dwellings selected from an official register and stratified by type and size. The analysed sample consists of 2372 respondents, aged 25 - 54 years, in 1414 households. Data were analysed in logistic regressions with self-rated health as a dichotomised outcome variable. The results show that those with less than compulsory education reported poor health twice as often as the highest-educated group. Material prosperity and relations within the family were important for self-rated health and explained to a certain degree the educational health differences. Lower educational groups now live under conditions often characterised by economic hardship, family conflicts, etc., and consequently also poor health.

40|$|CONTEXTTechnology {{has played}} an {{important}} role in the provision of educational equity for learners inAustralian communities. Engaging off-campus students through technology resources is vital for avirtual learning environment in engineering education. To ensure a positive experience for thestudents in off-campus (virtual) learning, the use of modern technology is crucial for collaborative andactive learning. PURPOSEDesign based education is a combination of project based and problem based approaches. Throughsmall or big projects, students work in teams with combinations of off-campus and on-campusstudents. Integration of technology resources takes place within these groups through collaborativelearning and active learning. Even though the facilities and technology support are provided for offcampusstudents, there is always a gap in fulfilling the off-campus students’ learning expectations in avirtual learning environment. Technology plays an important role in providing student engagement insolving design problems, which is a need for the distance learner community in future. The purpose ofthis study is to evaluate students’ experiences on the use of technology in learning and teaching,which is delivered in off-campus mode. APPROACHThe cohorts of students involved in this online survey are from first year undergraduate engineering inTrimester 2, 2016. The online survey analysis of students’ perceptions will help teaching staff to betterunderstand and assess off-campus students’ experiences, challenges and barriers in a virtual learningenvironment. RESULTSThe distance learners’ experiences are analysed from an online survey. This online survey analysesthe students’ experiences on use of technology and how it supports and enhances students learning indistance mode. It also analyses the student learning experiences on project/design-based learningapproach in engineering. In this particular unit (Electrical Systems), students work in teams of 2 - 3 onlab work and other assignments. The analysed results also discuss the students’ perceptions onteamwork, communication, interaction and assessment. CONCLUSIONSThe aim of the engineering curriculum is to provide learning and teaching support equally for both oncampusand off-campus students. From <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> <b>survey</b> results, this study reveals that the use oftechnology plays a vital role in students learning from availability and accessibility of materials toassessment methods, lab tutorials, and online seminars. In a project/design based learningcurriculum, the distance learners have an equal opportunity to enhance the learning skills as the oncampusstudents experience in a study environment...|$|E
40|$|Population ageing {{has become}} one of the most burning issues on the agenda of the social {{policy-makers}} in the industrialised countries. In 2050, about a quarter of the population of Belgium will be aged 65 + and a tenth 80 +. This change in the population structure is associated with an increase in the demand for community care. Therefore, the organisation of a sustainable long-term care system is one of the main challenges to address. So far, the family seems to remain the first, the main and the most stable source of elderly care. But family care has its limitations (it is not available for the family-less elderly and may have detrimental consequences for the care-givers if long-term and/or heavy care is needed). Social policies should be developed in order to support or to substitute family care and to provide sustainable long-term care for the elderly in the community. To do that, the first step is to have a good knowledge of the determinants and the dynamics of the care provided to the elderly by their family. This dissertation focuses on the care provided by the spouse and the children (the family care-givers) in Belgium. The approach is quantitative and, using the Life Course as theoretical framework, the dissertation tries to explore the longitudinal and contextual aspects of the study phenomenon. The main originality is to carry out a longitudinal analysis of the elderly family care characteristics in a representative sample of Belgian elderly. The three main research questions are addressed: Who is receiving family care? What are the characteristics of the received family care? How do these characteristics evolve over time? But before starting the analyses and answering those questions, the context and the methodology should be specified. Therefore the dissertation has been divided into three parts. The contextual part starts with a discussion of the concept of care and a presentation of the Life Course approach, continues with the review of the literature, then describes the Belgian context and ends with a comparison of the existing surveys dealing with elderly family care in Belgium. The methodological part begins with a presentation of <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> <b>survey</b> (the Panel Study of Belgian Households-PSBH 1992 - 2002) and the study sample (the 1, 123 respondents of Belgian nationality, who have answered - at least - both to the first and the third wave and are aged 65 + in 1994), afterwards, the preparation of the analysis file is detailed and the used variables are presented. The analysis part includes three chapters (one for each of the research questions). The family elderly care is a complex phenomenon which is part of an existing relationship. The risk of under-declaration is highlighted from the presentation of the care concept onward and many efforts were done in the data preparation to correct this declaration bias. But it still appears in the analyses results and can, therefore be considered as a main finding because it shows that the current terminology and its related question wording should be revised. In the conclusion, close support is suggested as an alternative to family care. Being more positive and inclusive, it would favour care declaration and allow the development of more comprehensive preventive supportive policy measures. Another important finding is the presence of regional differences: elderly Flemish were more likely to receive intensive and long-term family care and Brussels inhabitants were the most likely to rely only on care services or to receive no care at all. These differences were explained by the differences in elderly care policy orientations which also reflect strong cultural differences. Finally, the longitudinal approach highlighted that once the family starts to care, it is often for a long time, and especially when the elderly is very old or if a child cares for a spouseless parent. In both cases, care services are often used in complement. The elderly having a spouse are less likely to use care services and this should be a major concern for social policy-makers: elderly couples are often both frail and, without external support, they would be at high risk of institutionalisation. nrpages: 596 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|How {{persistent}} and universal has the two child family ideal been in Europe {{during the last}} three decades? We analyse responses of women of reproductive age from 168 surveys conducted in 37 countries in 1979 - 2012. A two-child ideal has become nearly universal among women in all parts of Europe. Countries that used to display higher ideal family size have converged over time towards a two-child model. Six out of ten women in Europe consider two children as ideal and this proportion is very similar in different regions. The mean ideal family size has become relatively closely clustered around 2. 2 in most countries. Gradual shifts can be documented towards more women expressing an ideal of having one child (and, quite rarely, having no children) and a parallel decline in an ideal of three or more children. An increasing number of European countries saw their mean ideal family size falling to relatively low level around 1. 95 - 2. 15. But with an exception of one survey for eastern Germany and a few additional surveys not included in our study due to high nonresponse, none of <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> <b>surveys</b> suggests a decline of mean ideal family size to levels considerably below replacement, i. e., below 1. 9 children per woman.
