5|$|Vettel set {{the fastest}} {{time in the}} second part of {{qualifying}} as well, being two-tenths faster than second placed Daniil Kvyat. While Max Verstappen made it into Q3, his teammate Sainz hit the wall in turn 19 close to the end of the session, damaging his suspension and front wing, with parts of debris left on the track. With the session ending under yellow flags, both Force India and both McLaren drivers joined Sainz in elimination, with Nico Hülkenberg fastest in eleventh place on the grid. Everyone behind Sainz failed to finish <b>their</b> <b>laps,</b> including Mercedes drivers Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for twenty minutes and eliminated the cars that finished the session eighteenth or lower. The second part of qualifying lasted fifteen minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to seventeen. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race; these started the race fitted with the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times. It was held in overcast weather conditions. Tyre degradation on the soft compound tyres was heavy; the drivers set <b>their</b> <b>laps</b> on the hard tyres during the first session and switched to softs for the two remaining sessions.|$|E
5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on <b>their</b> <b>laps,</b> watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E

25|$|The two McLaren {{drivers were}} the first two drivers out on the track for the initial fuel burning phase, and initially, Alonso was the fastest on the track. After {{the first set of}} pit stops it looked like Alonso was going to take the pole. On the last set of laps, Alonso was on a faster time than he was before, but Räikkönen was on a faster. Both of them {{completed}} <b>their</b> <b>laps</b> and Räikkönen came out on top, despite an error coming out of the final corner. Hamilton who had been sitting in fourth did not look like he was very competitive during qualifying. In the last few seconds of the session he set the fastest lap and put himself on pole position, and {{he was the only one}} to break into the 1 minute 19 second margin.|$|E
25|$|Bristol {{races are}} often {{the scene of the}} highest number of yellow-flag caution laps in the NASCAR season; with so many cars in such a small space, contact is almost inevitable. Until the Beneficiary Rule was instituted in 2004 (the rule was instituted after the races at Bristol in 2003), the short lap length and the {{unpredictable}} nature of the racing meant that {{this was one of the}} few remaining NASCAR tracks at which it was feasible for a driver to come back to win a race from several laps down; at most modern tracks, especially superspeedways, that was almost impossible. The short lap length also cuts the other way; any unscheduled pit stop for reasons such as a cut tire will result in the driver going two or more laps down as it is almost impossible to get anything done to a car during the time taken to complete one circuit, especially under green-flag conditions (approximately 15seconds). Thus, the disadvantage of losing laps means the chances of earning a free pass under the Beneficiary Rule is harder, since a driver losing two laps under a green-flag pit stop would have to race their way past the leader before the caution waved to regain one of <b>their</b> <b>laps</b> back, unless there are no cars one lap behind.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Jake & Jim and grew from an idea the band had to record a video in Iceland {{at the start of}} 2003 which didn't come off. The video begins with a close up of a cardboard box featuring a logo of two apples with the title 'Golden'. The band is shown playing along to [...] "Golden Retriever" [...] inside the box with Gruff Rhys wearing a red sports visor. Bassist Guto Pryce and keyboardist Cian Ciaran are both sat on settees with guitars on <b>their</b> <b>laps</b> which they are not playing. As the chorus begins the band transform into yetis and all begin playing [...] "Golden Retriever", several members headbanging in time with the track. The group wear their regular clothes for the second verse before the yeti costumes reappear for the second chorus. As the video ends the camera zooms out to show a Golden Retriever approach the box in an alleyway. The Super Furries raise their hands in the air and look up at the dog who then urinates on the box and runs away.|$|E
500|$|According {{to initial}} police statements, {{at this point}} {{one or more of}} the {{suspects}} began firing with semiautomatic handguns and Trooper Foerster fired four times before falling mortally wounded. At Acoli's trial, Harper testified that the gunfight started [...] "seconds" [...] after Foerster arrived at the scene. At this trial, Harper said that Foerster reached into the vehicle, pulled out and held up a semi-automatic pistol and ammunition magazine, and said [...] "Jim, look what I found", while facing Harper at the rear of the vehicle. At this point, Assata Shakur and Zayd Shakur were ordered to put their hands on <b>their</b> <b>laps</b> and not to move; Harper said that Assata Shakur then reached down to the right of her right leg, pulled out a pistol, and shot him in the shoulder, after which he retreated to behind his vehicle. Questioned by prosecutor C. Judson Hamlin, Harper said he saw Foerster shot just as Assata Shakur was felled by bullets from Harper's gun. Harper testified that Acoli shot Foerster with a [...]38 caliber semiautomatic pistol and then used Foerster's own gun to [...] "execute him". According to the testimony of State Police investigators, two jammed semi-automatic pistols were discovered near Foerster's body.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{disastrous}} crashes at Daytona 500 qualifying, NASCAR {{implemented a}} single-car two round qualifying system for restrictor plate races. In round 1, each car goes out {{one at a}} time for one warm-up, one timed, and one cool down lap. NASCAR will release the next car to begin <b>their</b> <b>lap</b> while the current car is finishing <b>their</b> timed <b>lap</b> with the goal to have the next car start <b>their</b> timed <b>lap</b> no more than 20 seconds after the previous car finishes. The top 12 cars from round 1 will make a second run in the same format to determine the starting lineup for positions 1-12, with positions 13-43 (as well as any DNQs) determined by round 1 result.|$|R

2500|$|In [...] "Power Laps", a {{car that}} has {{underwent}} a review, often a supercar, hypercar, high-performance roadster, or hatchback, undergoes a timed lap of the Top Gear test track, {{in the hands of}} The Stig. The circuit that is used was designed by Lotus, to test the cars on speed, power, and handling. The segment is often used after the main review of an episode, and mainly involves the car(s) that was featured in the review; in the case of multiple cars being shown, the film either shows <b>their</b> <b>laps</b> one after the other, or alongside each other. Their times are then placed on a Power Lap Board, containing all the times of the cars that underwent a Power Lap. Abbreviations next to lap times, such as [...] "W" [...] for [...] "wet", highlight if they were conducted under certain track conditions.|$|E
2500|$|The Liana endured {{considerable}} {{abuse from}} the stars while undertaking <b>their</b> <b>laps.</b> In one incident, actor Michael Gambon clipped the final corner, taking the car onto two wheels. It was done in such a spectacular fashion that the corner was named [...] "Gambon Corner". When Lionel Richie drove the Liana, one of the front wheels fell off, invoking Clarkson to coin the term [...] "pulling a Lionel". Trevor Eve also lost a wheel. [...] The former British transport minister Stephen Ladyman added further injury to the Liana by denting the boot when he lost control during practice and slid backwards into a tyre wall. David Soul destroyed the gearbox of two Lianas during his time on the show due to his rough driving style. Patrick Kielty broke the Liana's front suspension during series 4 when he drove on the grass. Christopher Eccleston was the only celebrity to use a Liana with an automatic transmission, because a hesitant Eccleston admitted he was [...] "only qualified to drive an automatic." [...] To accommodate his needs, Top Gear succeeded in borrowing an automatic Liana, of which only 40 existed in the UK. As a reference to his role in Doctor Who, the automatic Liana was shown materialising onto the racing track, with a TARDIS materialisation sound effect played over it.|$|E
