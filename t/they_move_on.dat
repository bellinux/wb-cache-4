5|$|In {{the summer}} the {{fieldfare}} frequents mixed woodland of birch, alder, pine, spruce and fir, often near marshes, moorland or other open ground. It does not avoid {{the vicinity of}} humans and {{can be seen in}} cultivated areas, orchards, parks and gardens. It also inhabits open tundra and the slopes of hills above the tree line. In the winter, groups of fieldfares are chiefly found in open country, agricultural land, orchards and open woodland. They are nomadic, wandering wherever there is an abundance of berries and insects. Later in the year <b>they</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to pastureland and cultivated fields.|$|E
5|$|In each level, {{the player}} may come across one other player {{temporarily}} connected to their game. When players approach each other they charge one another's scarves. They cannot {{communicate with each}} other beyond patterns of singing. Players can help each other by activating strips of cloth or showing paths, but cannot hinder each other and are not necessary for completing any level. When two players finish a section {{at the same time they}} remain together into the next one; otherwise they are connected to new players when <b>they</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> While all of the figures generally look the same, without distinguishing characteristics, individual players can be told apart by unique symbols which are shown floating in the air when they sing and are displayed on their robes at all times. The entire game takes about two to three hours to complete.|$|E
5|$|Libby {{is still}} in the mental {{institution}} in the alternate timeline. One day she sees a Mr. Cluck's commercial with Hurley in it, and memories of her past life on the Island come flooding back to her. Later at a Mexican restaurant, Libby sees Hurley, and tells him she thinks they may be connected and be soul mates. Hurley later tracks her down, and she tells him of her visions and the fact in those visions Hurley was also in the mental institution. Hurley then invites her on a date. On the date they kiss and Hurley's memories of the Island come flooding back to him, and he assures Libby she isn't crazy. When the alternate time line is revealed to be a meeting place before the afterlife Libby reunites with many of the other characters in a church. She sits beside Hurley as <b>they</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> together into the afterlife.|$|E

5|$|When {{they return}} to Tokyo, thirty years have passed, and the world lies in ruins. Both demons and humans live in Tokyo, and two warring groups have formed: the Order of Messiah, who is {{building}} a cathedral and wants {{to bring about the}} Thousand-Year Kingdom, and the Ring of Gaea, who intends to summon Lucifer and wants freedom. While exploring the city, the Hero meets the Heroine, who has been reincarnated, and she joins the group. They keep traversing the ruins, until the Chaos Hero decides to leave, and fuses himself with a demon to gain power; <b>they</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> without him, until the Law Hero's soul gets taken by an attacking demon. The Chaos Hero joins the Ring of Gaea, while the Law Hero's soul gets reincarnated as the new Messiah. Both try to get the Hero to join their respective side; players can choose to support either, or to reject both. Regardless of what they choose, the Order of Messiah finishes building their cathedral, and a great flood appears, drowning people who were not inside the cathedral at the time. Survivors set up camps inside the cathedral; the Order of Messiah takes control of the top floors, while the Ring of Gaea occupies the basement floors.|$|E
25|$|The entire {{contingent}} {{is housed}} in Mount Vernon Camp, which is their one-stop location for {{work as well as}} personal life.

25|$|Saskatchewan's Tier II, Junior A men's teams {{compete in}} the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League. This league is a {{division}} of Canadian Junior A Hockey League. Currently, the SJHL consists of 12 teams from throughout the province, including one from Manitoba (the Flin Flon Bombers). The teams compete for the Credential Cup {{and the right to}} advance to the Anavet Cup against the Manitoba Junior Hockey League champion. If they win that series, <b>they</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to the Canadian championship called the Royal Bank Cup. The Prince Albert Raiders have won the tournament three times, the Weyburn Red Wings twice and the Notre Dame Hounds and Humboldt Broncos once each.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the war, the Japanese {{government}} continually rejected {{requests from}} the German government to establish anti-Semitic policies. Towards the end, Nazi representatives pressured the Japanese army {{to devise a}} plan to exterminate Shanghai's Jewish population and this pressure eventually became known to the Jewish community's leadership. However, the Japanese {{had no intention of}} further provoking the anger of the Allies and thus delayed the German request for a time, eventually rejecting it entirely. One Orthodox Jewish institution saved in this manner was the Lithuanian Haredi Mir yeshiva. The Japanese government and people offered the Jews temporary shelter, medical services, food, transportation, and gifts, but preferred that <b>they</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to reside in Japanese-occupied Shanghai.|$|E
25|$|The Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) is a {{national}} examination in Singapore that {{is administered by the}} Ministry of Education and taken by all students near the end of their sixth year in primary school before <b>they</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to secondary school. The examination tests students' proficiency in the English language, their respective mother tongue languages (typically Chinese, Malay, Tamil or other Indian language), mathematics and science. Students have around two hours to complete each subject paper except for certain components of language subjects. Students answer multiple choice questions by shading their responses on a standardised optical answer sheet (OAS) that uses optical mark recognition to detect answers or by writing their workings and/or answers on the question booklet itself for certain sections of the paper.|$|E

25|$|In {{those two}} weeks, the Brotherhood {{has been using}} the now-reactivated Liberty Prime to root out the {{remaining}} Enclave presence in the Capital Wasteland. The player joins them, only to watch Liberty Prime be destroyed by a devastating orbital strike. Taking out this new threat becomes the top priority. A short side-mission is arranged to equip the player with the powerful Tesla Cannon, after which <b>they</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> the Enclave's massive Mobile Crawler base, located outside of the Wasteland at Adams Air Force Base. After fighting through the base personnel, a control station at the top {{can be used to}} call an orbital strike on the base itself, destroying it. Alternatively, the Citadel can be destroyed, marking the player a traitor to the Brotherhood of Steel.|$|E

500|$|Eric Cartman attends South Park Elementary {{as part of}} Mr. Garrison's class. During the show's first 58 episodes, Cartman and {{the other}} main {{characters}} are in the third grade, after which <b>they</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to the fourth grade. He is an only child being raised by Liane Cartman, a promiscuous single mother. In [...] "Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut" [...] (1998), Liane Cartman {{claims to be a}} hermaphrodite when she also claims to be the father of Cartman and that she did not know the woman who gave birth to Cartman. However, the season 14 (2010) episode [...] "201" [...] later reveals that Liane actually is his mother, and that his true biological father is Jack Tenorman, a fictional former player for the Denver Broncos whom Cartman arranged to be killed in the season five (2001) episode [...] "Scott Tenorman Must Die", making Cartman and Scott Tenorman half-brothers and putting Liane's intersexual identity in question.|$|E
500|$|Emus forage in a {{diurnal pattern}} {{and eat a}} variety of native and {{introduced}} plant species. The diet depends on seasonal availability with such plants as Acacia, Casuarina and grasses being favoured. They also eat insects and other arthropods, including grasshoppers and crickets, beetles, cockroaches, ladybirds, bogong and cotton-boll moth larvae, ants, spiders and millipedes. This provides {{a large part of}} their protein requirements. In Western Australia, food preferences have been observed in travelling emus; they eat seeds from Acacia aneura until the rains arrive, after which <b>they</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to fresh grass shoots and caterpillars; in winter they feed on the leaves and pods of Cassia and in spring, they consume grasshoppers and the fruit of Santalum acuminatum, a sort of quandong. They are also known to feed on wheat, and any fruit or other crops that they can access, easily climbing over high fences if necessary. Emus serve as an important agent for the dispersal of large viable seeds, which contributes to floral biodiversity. One undesirable effect of this occurred in Queensland {{in the early twentieth century}} when emus fed on the fruit of prickly pears in the outback. They defecated the seeds in various places as they moved around, and this led to a series of campaigns to hunt emus and prevent the seeds of the invasive cactus being spread. The cacti were eventually controlled by an introduced moth (Cactoblastis cactorum [...] ) whose larvae fed on the plant, one of the earliest examples of biological control.|$|E
2500|$|Animals move through, or on, {{four types}} of environment: aquatic (in or on water), {{terrestrial}} (on ground or other surface, including arboreal, or tree-dwelling), fossorial (underground), and aerial (in the air).
