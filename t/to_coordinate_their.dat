However, he was wary of trying to seize Arnhem before the IJssel had been bridged further north.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are gregarious creatures; {{the basic}} social unit {{is a pair}} or small family group of {{about three or four}} birds, usually parents {{together}} with juvenile offspring, though some of such groups are unrelated. In the non-breeding season, they gather into large flocks, which appear to be many self-contained individual groups rather than a single social unit. Within the flock, families tend to remain separate and <b>to</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>their</b> activities with one another rather than with the flock as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Burnet was, however, {{unable to}} prove this experimentally. Peter Medawar, Rupert E. Billingham and Leslie Brent did find support for Burnet's {{hypothesis}} in 1953 when they showed that splenocytes could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other tissues from the donor but not from any other mouse strain. Burnet and Medawar were co-recipients of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work, as it provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance, thereby allowing the transplantation of solid organs. Burnet and Medawar were able <b>to</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>their</b> work effectively despite the rather different personalities and physical separation; Burnet was taciturn whereas Medawar was a young and urbane Englishman, but they greatly respected one another.|$|E

5|$|The British Parliament's {{efforts to}} levy new taxes {{following}} the French and Indian War were deeply unpopular in the colonies. In the House of Burgesses, opposition to {{taxation without representation}} was led by Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee, among others. Virginians began <b>to</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>their</b> actions with other colonies in 1773, and sent delegates to the Continental Congress the following year. After the House of Burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor in 1774, Virginia's revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the Virginia Conventions. On May 15, 1776, the Convention declared Virginia's independence from the British Empire and adopted George Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights, which was then included in a new constitution. Another Virginian, Thomas Jefferson, drew upon Mason's work in drafting the national Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|The Latin {{presence}} in the Balkans seriously undermined the Byzantines' ability <b>to</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>their</b> efforts against the Ottoman Turks. This is exemplified by Michael VIII Palaeologus, whose attempts to drive the Latins out of Greece led to the abandonment of the Anatolian borders which allowed several beyliks, {{as well as the}} Turks of Osman I to raid and settle former Byzantine lands. Andronicus II's campaigns in Anatolia, though it obtained some military success, was constantly thwarted by events in the west of the Empire. In any event, the Byzantines were forced to choose between Papal and Latin threat of attack or an unpopular union, which was exploited by numerous rival claimants as cause for a coup against the Byzantine Emperor.|$|E
5|$|The United Kingdom did {{not have}} the {{manpower}} or resources of the United States, and despite its early and promising start, Tube Alloys fell behind its American counterpart. The British considered producing an atomic bomb without American help, but it would require overwhelming priority, disruption to other wartime projects was inevitable, and it was unlikely to be ready in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe. At the Quebec Conference in August 1943, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and the President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, signed the Quebec Agreement, which merged the two national projects. The Quebec Agreement established the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust <b>to</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>their</b> efforts. The 19 September 1944 Hyde Park Agreement extended both commercial and military cooperation into the post-war period.|$|E

5|$|The ARBiH offensive, codenamed Autumn-94 (Jesen-94), {{started on}} 20 October, {{with the primary}} aim of {{advancing}} from Bugojno towards VRS-held Donji Vakuf, supported by a secondary attack towards Kupres aimed at disruption of the VRS defences and threatening a supply route to Donji Vakuf. The primary attacking force soon ground to a halt, shifting {{the focus of the}} operation to Kupres, where substantial reinforcements were deployed to ensure a gradual advance of the ARBiH. On 29 October, the HVO decided to attack, as it considered the ARBiH had directly threatened the strategic Kupres plateau. The HVO launched its offensive, codenamed Operation Cincar (Operacija Cincar), on 1 November. Following a brief lull in the ARBiH advance, thought to be brought on by a variety of causes and a direct request by the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina Alija Izetbegović to the ARBiH to cooperate with the HVO, commanding officers of the two forces met <b>to</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>their</b> operations {{for the first time since}} the Washington Agreement. Kupres itself was captured by the HVO on 3 November 1994.|$|E
5|$|The Székelys were a {{community}} of privileged border guards. They fought in the royal army, {{for which they were}} exempted from taxation. A royal official, the count of the Székelys, was their supreme leader, but the Székely seats were administered by elected officials. The Saxons also had the right to elect the magistrates of their seats. They enjoyed personal freedom and paid a lump sum tax to the monarchs. The wealthiest Saxon towns – Bistritz, Hermannstadt and Kronstadt (Bistrița, Sibiu and Brașov) – owned large estates which were cultivated by hundreds of peasants. Dozens of Saxons and Székely families held landed property in the counties, for which they also enjoyed the status of noblemen. Saxon and Székely leaders were occasionally invited to Torda to attend the general assemblies, which enabled the leaders of the three nations <b>to</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>their</b> actions.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} {{military}} mandarin from central Vietnam, Định moved south {{when his father was}} posted to Gia Định as the provincial commander. Định grew up to lead {{a military}} colony, overseeing the settlement and economic development of his constituency. He gained a reputation for being an able leader and land developer who cared for his people. When France began its invasion of southern Vietnam in 1859, Định organised local militia to reinforce the imperial army. As the regular army units suffered defeats on the battlefield, its remnants joined Định's partisans, and by 1861, he had around 6,000 men under his command. Định built his own resistance base and organised guerrilla attacks against the French. His success led Tự Đức to grant Định command of the southern partisans and to order the regular commanders <b>to</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>their</b> plans with him. Định's forces quickly gained the respect of the French. They focused on disrupting the French bureaucracy and military posts in addition to the transportation of rice. Their most notable attack was the sinking of L'Espérance in December 1861.|$|E

5|$|The warfare {{with the}} Prussians relied on guerilla raids {{in the border}} regions. Small groups of men, a dozen to a hundred, made quick raids on farms, villages, border posts, etc. This was a {{positional}} warfare where neither side could defeat the other, but the Teutonic Knights relied on future reinforcements from Germany and Europe, while Prussians were draining their local resources. After the massacre of surrendered Teutonic soldiers in the Battle of Krücken in 1249, the Knights refused {{to negotiate with the}} Prussians. The Prussians were also unable <b>to</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>their</b> efforts and develop a common strategy: while each clan had its own leader, {{there was no one to}} lead all the clans. The Natangians had to watch for attacks from Balga, Brandenburg, Wehlau, and Königsberg while the Warmians were threatened by garrisons at Christburg and Elbing. This way only Diwane and his Bartians were able to continue the war in the west. They made several minor expeditions to Culmerland each year.|$|E

Besides Tuđman and Izetbegović, the agreement was signed by President of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Krešimir Zubak, and the Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina Haris Silajdžić.
