25|$|Determined to trap Cafferty {{once and}} for all, Rebus uses his {{contacts}} {{to set up a}} sting operation, with child molester Andrew McPhail being used as the unwitting bait. Cafferty is caught red-handed attacking McPhail outside the Operation Moneybags surveillance, and is arrested. With Cafferty in jail, the police are able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look at his operation. A farm in the Borders is raided, where Cafferty used to personally execute his enemies. Deek Torrance is amongst those arrested there. In exchange for leniency, Eddie Ringan agrees to testify against Cafferty.|$|E
25|$|The general {{analysis}} strategy begins with high resolution cameras {{to look for}} features of interest. If a particular surface is of interest, Curiosity can vaporize {{a small portion of}} it with an infrared laser and examine the resulting spectra signature to query the rock's elemental composition. If that signature intrigues, the rover will use its long arm to swing over a microscope and an X-ray spectrometer <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look. If the specimen warrants further analysis, Curiosity can drill into the boulder and deliver a powdered sample to either the SAM or the CheMin analytical laboratories inside the rover.|$|E
25|$|Timekeeper {{announced}} that guests were {{just in time}} for a meeting between H.G. Wells and Jules Verne. Nine-Eye hid from the fair-goers but not so that Verne and Wells were hidden. After a brief conversation about their conflicting visions of the Future, Wells walked away, leaving Verne with a model of his Time Machine, which Verne had just criticized as impossible. After a sarcastic comment about time travel from Verne, Nine-Eye rebutted his claim and appeared to the author. Jules Verne decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look at her and tried to grab her. Timekeeper, seeing this, tried to bring her back to the present, but accidentally took Verne as well.|$|E

He quickly assembled two companies of grenadiers to lead toward the North Bridge himself. As these troops marched, they met the shattered remnants of the three light infantry companies running towards them.

When he saw the Minutemen in the distance behind their wall, he halted his two companies and moved forward with only his officers <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look. [...] One of the Minutemen behind that wall observed, [...] "If we had fired, I believe we could have killed almost every officer there was in the front, but we had no orders to fire and there wasn't a gun fired."

2500|$|The {{feminine}} {{categorization of}} Egypt, and subsequently Cleopatra, was negatively portrayed throughout early criticism. The story of Antony and Cleopatra was often summarised as either [...] "the fall {{of a great}} general, betrayed in his dotage by a treacherous strumpet, or else it {{can be viewed as}} a celebration of transcendental love." [...] In both reduced summaries, Egypt and Cleopatra are presented as either the destruction of Antony's masculinity and greatness or as agents in a love story. Once the Women's Liberation Movement grew between the 1960s and 1980s, however, critics began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look at both Shakespeare's characterization of Egypt and Cleopatra and the work and opinions of other critics on the same matter.|$|E
2500|$|John F. Montgomery, {{who served}} in Budapest as U.S. {{ambassador}} from 1933 to 1941, openly admired this side of Horthy's character and reported the following incident in his memoir: in March 1939, Arrow Cross supporters disrupted a performance at the Budapest opera house by chanting [...] "Justice for Szálasi!" [...] loud enough for the regent to hear. A fight broke out, and when Montgomery went <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look, he discovered that:two or three men were {{on the floor and}} he [...] had another by the throat, slapping his face and shouting what I learned afterward was: [...] "So you would betray your country, would you?" [...] The Regent was alone, but he had the situation in hand.... The whole incident was typical not only of the Regent's deep hatred of alien doctrine, but of the kind of man he is. Although he was around seventy two years of age, it did not occur to him to ask for help; he went right ahead like a skipper with a mutiny on his hands.|$|E

(M20) It was not unnatural that fault {{should be}} found {{with him for}} not making a more {{resolute}} effort to lighten the burden of that heavy mortgage which, {{under the name of}} the National Debt, we have laid upon the industry and property of the nation. In 1866 he was keenly excited by Jevons’s argument from the ultimate shrinkage of our coal supply, and he accepted the inference that we should vigorously apply ourselves by reduction of the debt to preparation for the arrival of the evil day. But, as he wrote to Jevons (March 16, 1866), “Until the great work of the liberation of industry was in the main effected, it would have been premature or even wrong to give too much prominence to this view of the subject. Nor do I regard that liberation as yet having reached the point at which we might say, we will now cease to make remission of taxes a principal element and aim in finance. But we are in my judgment near it. And I am most anxious that the public should begin <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> and more practical view of the topics which you have done so much to bring into prominence.” ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was above}} {{asserted}} that J. D. Harding is, after Turner, the greatest master of foliage in Europe; I ought, however, {{to state that}} my knowledge of the modern landscape of Germany is very limited, and that, even with respect to France and Italy, I judge rather from the general tendency of study and character of mind visible in the annual Exhibition of the Louvre, and in some galleries of modern paintings at Milan, Venice, and Florence, than from any detailed acquaintance with the works of their celebrated painters. Yet I think I can hardly be mistaken. I have seen nothing to induce me <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> survey; no life knowledge or emotion in any quarter; nothing but the meanest and most ignorant copyism of vulgar details, coupled with a style of conception resembling that of the various lithographic ideals on the first leaves of the music of pastoral ballads. An exception ought, however, {{to be made in}} favor of French etching; some studies in black and white may be seen in the narrow passages of the Louvre of very high merit, showing great skill and delicacy of execution, and most determined industry; (in fact, I think when the French artist fails, it is never through fear of labor;) nay, more than this, some of them exhibit acute perception of landscape character and great power of reaching simple impressions of gloom, wildness, sound, and motion. Some of their illustrated works also exhibit these powers in a high degree; there is a spirit, fire, and sense of reality about some of the wood-cuts to the large edition of Paul and Virginia, and a determined rendering of separate feeling in each, such as we look for in vain in our own ornamental works.[76] But the French appear to have no teaching such as might carry them beyond this; their entire ignorance of color renders the assumption of the brush instantly fatal, and the false, forced, and impious sentiment of the nation renders anything like grand composition altogether impossible.|$|E
