5|$|In Japan, <b>the</b> <b>Gin</b> Tama manga {{has been}} popular, selling over 50 million copies, {{making it one}} of the best-selling manga series. The anime and its DVDs have been featured, at various times, in Top Ten rankings of their {{respective}} media, while TV Tokyo has announced that the first Gin Tama anime was responsible for high sales overseas along with the anime adaptation from Naruto. Publications for manga, anime and others have commented on <b>the</b> <b>Gin</b> Tama manga. Positive responses have focused on the comedy and characters from the series, as well as its overarching plot and action choreography.|$|E

The location where he was killed in Franklin, Tennessee was reclaimed by preservationists and is now known as Cleburne Park. Though the small monument in the park is often perceived as a monument to Cleburne, it actually is a marker to show where The Carter Family Cotton Gin once stood (<b>the</b> <b>gin</b> being {{an integral part of the}} Battle of Franklin, and The Carter House itself being the headquarters of Union Brigadier General Jacob D.

5|$|In November 2008, an {{agreement}} was reached between TV Tokyo and the streaming video service Crunchyroll. Crunchyroll would stream English-subtitled episodes for free one week after they had aired in Japan. Paying subscribers can watch new episodes an hour after they air in Japan. On January 8, 2009, Crunchyroll uploaded their first episode (episode 129) to the service. Alongside new episodes each week, Crunchyroll also uploads episodes {{from the beginning of}} the series. The anime is licensed in North America by Sentai Filmworks, with distribution from Section23 Films. Section23 Films' Chris Oarr commented that only the first two seasons were licensed, with an option on the rest. The first collection containing thirteen English-subtitled episodes was released on DVD, April 27, 2010. Only 49 episodes were released before the releases stalled. However, shortly after licensing <b>the</b> <b>Gin</b> Tama film, Sentai Filmworks announced that based on the film's performance, they would consider releasing more of the series in North America, possibly with an English dub. An English subtitled version of the series began airing on Shorts HD on July 12, 2015. On July 1, 2016, Crunchyroll announced that they will re-release the series on Blu-ray and DVD with an English dub.|$|E

25|$|A Gin Pennant {{means that}} the wardroom is {{inviting}} officers from ships in company to drinks. The origins of <b>the</b> <b>Gin</b> Pennant are uncertain, {{but it seems to}} have been used since the 1940s and probably earlier. Originally it was a small green triangular pennant measuring approximately , defaced with a white wine glass, nowadays <b>the</b> <b>gin</b> pennant is a Starboard pennant defaced with a wine or cocktail glass. Its colour, size and position when hoisted were all significant as the aim was for the pennant to be as inconspicuous as possible, thereby having fewer ships sight it and subsequently accept the invitation for drinks. <b>The</b> <b>Gin</b> Pennant is still in regular use by Commonwealth Navies, such as the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Within the RAN it is common practice, whilst in port, for junior officers of one ship to attempt to raise <b>the</b> <b>Gin</b> Pennant on the halyard of another ship, thereby forcing that ship to put on free drinks for the officers of the ship that managed to raise the pennant. If, however the junior officers are caught raising the pennant, then it is their ship that must put on free drinks within their Wardroom. Usually this practice is restricted to Commonwealth Navies; however, prior to increased force protection, RAN officers have successfully raised <b>the</b> <b>Gin</b> Pennant on a number of units in the USN.|$|E
