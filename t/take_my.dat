5|$|Because I {{always try}} {{so hard to}} win and had my {{troubles}} in Boston, I was suspended. At playoff time it hurts {{not be in the}} game with the boys. However, I want to do what is good for the people of Montreal and the team. So that no further harm will be done, I would like to ask everyone to get behind the team and to help the boys win from the New York Rangers and Detroit. I will <b>take</b> <b>my</b> punishment and come back next year to help the club and the younger players to win the Cup.|$|E

5|$|Djajakusuma's next production, Terimalah Laguku (<b>Take</b> <b>My</b> Song; 1952), was {{a musical}} about an old, impoverished {{musician}} who sells his saxophone {{to help his}} former student's career. Though the film's technical quality was poor, {{when he returned to}} Indonesia in 1953 Ismail was pleased with the work, stating that the editing had been done well. Over the next year Ismail conveyed information he learned at UCLA to the Perfini staff; Djajakusuma followed these lessons closely. This was followed by Harimau Tjampa (Tiger from Tjampa) in 1953, a film about a man who attempts to avenge his father's death. Set amidst Minang culture, the film featured some of the first nudity in a domestic production and was a considerable critical success.|$|E

When I am found, which has already been done, please give this typewriter to Craig , and tell him that I hope that his child is a boy, it will (help) him in his work.

25|$|In 1950, CBS asked Ball to <b>take</b> <b>My</b> Favorite Husband to {{television}} with co-star Richard Denning. She, however, saw {{a television show}} as {{a great opportunity to}} work with Desi as it would keep them both in Hollywood, and perhaps save their shaky marriage. Lucy insisted that Desi play her husband, much to the dismay of CBS, which was reluctant because Arnaz was Cuban. Network executives believed that audiences would not believe the marriage between an all-American girl and a Latin man. To prove CBS wrong, the couple developed a vaudeville act, written by Carroll and Pugh, that they took on the road with Arnaz's orchestra. The act was a hit and convinced CBS executive Harry Ackerman that a Ball-Arnaz pairing would be a worthwhile venture. At the same time, rival networks NBC, ABC, and DuMont were showing interest in a Ball-Arnaz series, which Ackerman used to convince CBS to sign the duo.|$|E
25|$|Member of Parliament John H. Bryden {{put forward}} an {{amendment}} that would remove the sovereign from the oath altogether: In pledging allegiance to Canada, I <b>take</b> <b>my</b> place among Canadians, a people united by God whose sacred trust is to uphold these five principles: equality of opportunity, freedom of speech, democracy, basic human rights, {{and the rule of}} law. Bryden's proposal was defeated in a vote of 189 to 31, and Bill C-63 itself never received Royal Assent; after approval by the House of Commons and a second reading in the Senate, the bill was under consideration by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs when a federal election was called, resulting in the bill's demise on the Order Paper. Subsequent Bills C-16 (2000) and C-18 (2002) also proposed the same changes to the Oath of Citizenship; the former also died on the Order Paper due to the prorogation of parliament, while the latter never made it past second reading in the House of Commons.|$|E

The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to <b>take</b> <b>my</b> life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E
