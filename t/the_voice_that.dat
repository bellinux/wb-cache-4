5|$|At that point, {{the party}} reunites with Zola, who {{supplies}} a Mechat {{for them to}} pursue Nene. As the party goes after Nene in the Mechat, Nene initiates an ancient machine that splits the world into two hemispheres, with thousands of isolated cubes floating between the halves. The party follows Nene to the Primitive Cube {{at the core of}} the transformation. The party journeys through the cube eventually defeating General Szabo and ultimately engaging Nene. As the party weakens Nene, it is revealed that Zola was working for Nene all along, and she was <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> told the others to swallow the spheres. When Zola was too weak to defend herself, Nene had given her a shadow and sent her to Jibral as a spy. Zola betrays and kills Nene choosing her friends over him.|$|E
25|$|Despite their {{systematic}} oppression, a {{class of}} Hutu political intelligentsia influenced by contemporary communist thought emerged, forming a stance against elite rule of the proletariat masses, which was reinterpreted as Tutsi rule over the Hutu. This Hutu counter-elite exploded onto the political scene in the late 1950s as both Belgian colonial influence and their firm support of the Tutsi minority declined. The emerging Hutu counter-elite provided a voice to the majority “Hutu” people, via a series of political proclamations and, later, sweeping electoral victories. Yet <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> emerged was one embittered by decades of subjugation; one which championed Hutu nationalism and anti-Tutsi sentiment. The result was a “Hutu political consciousness” driven by populist and nationalistic forces, {{with the goal of}} dethroning the privileged Tutsi and driving a deeper wedge between their peoples.|$|E
500|$|Movement 3 {{presents}} two text elements interwoven, the recitative [...] "" [...] (The wish {{and will}} of mankind are of little use), and the interspersed four {{lines of the}} hymn's third stanza, [...] "" [...] (God, Holy Spirit, worthy Comforter). The recitative lines are sung by alternating voices alto and tenor, while the interspersed chorale lines are rendered by both voices in duet. In this duet, <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> enters sings the embellished hymn tune, while the other accompanies.|$|E

Lee stated that the character is “a happy-go-lucky guy. He does {{not like to be}} under the thumb of authority. He likes card games and women.” [...] Ealy described the character’s indifference: “I think Bishop is <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> doesn’t believe change is going to come, and doesn’t believe that he belongs over there fighting.” [...] Terrence Howard was originally in talks to play Bishop, prior to Ealy's casting.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Clarke {{published}} {{a collection of}} eight fairy tales presented {{as the work of}} several different writers, seven of which had been previously anthologized. The volume's focus on [...] "female mastery of the dark arts" [...] is reflected in the ladies of Grace Adieu's magical abilities and the prominent role needlework plays in saving the Duke of Wellington and Mary, Queen of Scots. The collection is a [...] "sly, frequently comical, feminist revision" [...] of Jonathan Strange. In tone, the stories are similar to the novel—"nearly every one of them is told in a lucid, frequently deadpan, bedtime-story voice strikingly similar to <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> narrates the novel." ...|$|E
500|$|Cumming came up {{with the}} idea that the Eternals would not blink and cast actors who she {{believed}} could provide detached performances. Cumming recalled Peter Sallis had played a similarly detached character in the 1974 BBC drama The Pallisers, and cast him in the role of Striker. Sallis was present during the rehearsals for the serial but when production was delayed he was unavailable for the new filming dates, being committed to filming Last of the Summer Wine and was forced to drop out of the production, being replaced by Keith Barron. [...] Lynda Baron was cast as Captain Wrack, having previously participated in Doctor Who in the 1966 serial The Gunfighters, as <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> sings the [...] "Ballad of the Last Chance Saloon" [...] heard throughout that story. Tony Caunter, who had previously played Thatcher in The Crusade and Morgan in Colony in Space was given the role of Jackson, with Christopher Brown and David Rhule being cast as Marriner and Wrack's sidekick Mansell respectively. Similarly to Sallis, David Rhule was unavailable for the revised filming dates in January, so singer Leee John replaced him at short notice, despite having no previous acting experience.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{typically}} reviewed [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] favorably. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly {{felt the}} song was [...] "not bad business for stationary cardio, but not the stuff year-end top tens are made of, either." [...] She said it didn't offer [...] "major sensations" [...] and found it similar to Christina Aguilera’s [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] (2010). Greenblatt was also disappointed with the song's rhyming in the lines, [...] "I'm not here to sell ya' / Or tell {{you to go to}} hell". Sonya Sorich of Ledger-Enquirer said that while she anticipated some negative reception, [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] was also a prime candidate for a guilty pleasure dance track." [...] Heather Phares of Allmusic referred to [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] as [...] "stomping" [...] and selected it as one of the album's best. Fraser McAlpine of BBC said that though the song has strong sexual undercurrents, Cyrus maintained classy throughout the track [...] [...] "If Miley's gonna weather the Ensexification Moment it'll be because she's doing it during a period of extrema GaGa, when videos are less about acreage of flesh and more about feathers and Victorian scientists. Oh, and because she's got the songs and <b>the</b> <b>voice,</b> <b>that</b> always helps", McAlpine concluded.|$|E

2500|$|In 1996, Garner's novel Strandloper was published. His {{collection}} of essays and public talks, <b>The</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>That</b> Thunders, contains much autobiographical material (including an account of his life with bipolar disorder), as well as critical reflection upon folklore and language, literature and education, the nature of myth and time. In <b>The</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>That</b> Thunders he reveals the commercial pressure placed upon him during the decade-long drought which preceded Strandloper to 'forsake [...] "literature", and become instead a [...] "popular" [...] writer, cashing in on my established name by producing sequels to, and making series of, the earlier books'. Garner feared that [...] "making series ... would render sterile the existing work, the life that produced it, and bring about my artistic and spiritual death" [...] and felt unable to comply.|$|E

2500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song talk about the people behind someone who laughs at another person: behind them is someone who further laughs at him, and someone who is sad.

In the final stanza, he feels that when he points to himself, he feels stuck with fear, but realises <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> can change everything is his own.|$|E

The two passages each describe the experience of Paul's traveling companions during the revelation, with Acts 9:7 (the author's description of the event) stating that Paul's traveling companions heard <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> spoke to him; and Acts 22:9 (the author's quotation of Paul's own words) traditionally stating they did not.|$|E

Wilkins said: [...] "Regardless of the fact that in his later years Dr. Du Bois chose another path, it is incontrovertible that {{at the dawn of the}} twentieth century his was <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> was calling you to gather here today in this cause.
