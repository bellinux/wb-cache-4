5|$|Each fusion {{event in}} the D-T fusion reactor gives off an alpha {{particle}} and a fast neutron with around 14MeV of kinetic energy. This is enough energy to cause fission in U-238, and many other transuranic elements as well. This reaction is used in H-bombs to increase the yield of <b>the</b> <b>fusion</b> section by wrapping it in a layer of depleted uranium, which undergoes rapid fission when hit by the neutrons from <b>the</b> <b>fusion</b> bomb inside. The same basic concept {{can also be used}} with a fusion reactor like LIFE, using its neutrons to cause fission in a blanket of fission fuel. Unlike a fission reactor, which burns out its fuel once the U-235 drops below a certain threshold value, these fission–fusion hybrid reactors can continue producing power from the fission fuel as long as <b>the</b> <b>fusion</b> reactor continues to provide neutrons. As the neutrons have high energy, they can potentially cause multiple fission events, leading to the reactor as a whole producing more energy, a concept known as energy multiplication. Even leftover nuclear fuel taken from conventional nuclear reactors will burn in this fashion. This is potentially attractive because this burns off many of the long lived radioisotopes in the process, producing waste that is only mildly radioactive and lacking most long-lived components.|$|E

The added tails allowed selective binding and release of [beta]-galactosidase in active form from Escherichia coli cell extract. The purification factors increased with fusion length. For BGCD 11, more than six fold enrichment in [beta]-galactosidase was obtained. The specific activity was comparable to that of commercial wild type and affinity-purified [beta]-galactosidase;The potential end use advantages of <b>the</b> <b>fusions</b> for immobilization was studied using flat sheet ion-exchange membranes. The added tails did not interfere with the kinetic behavior for lactose hydrolysis. The enhanced binding of BGCD 11 on the membrane enabled the enzyme to hydrolyze acid whey permeate at 0. 3 M ionic strength without leakage. An intregated separation and immobilization scheme was illustrated by the development of an immobilized enzyme reactor directly from cell extract;The protein retention behavior was investigated using high performance liquid chromatography with perfusion packings. The added tails promoted retention which increased with the tail length (charge) and were best utilized closer to the isoelectric point. The two parameters, Z and I, obtained from the stoichiometric displacement model were used to characterize the protein interaction with the ion-exchange surface. At pH 5. 7, the Z number increased with tail length (charge) and was 11. 5, 8. 5, 6. 9 and 5. 3 for BGCD 11, BGCD 5, BGCD 1 and BGWT, respectively. At these conditions, <b>the</b> <b>fusions</b> had very similar I values which were five times smaller than those of BGWT. However, the increase in Z numbers outweighed the decrease in I values and an overall enhanced retention was reported.
