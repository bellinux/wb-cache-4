5|$|Goffman's book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963) {{examines}} how, {{to protect}} <b>their</b> <b>identities</b> when they depart from approved standards of behavior or appearance, people manage impressions of themselves – mainly through concealment. Stigma {{pertains to the}} shame that a person may feel {{when he or she}} fails to meet other people's standards, and to the fear of being discredited – which causes the individual not to reveal his or her shortcomings. Thus, a person with a criminal record may simply withhold that information from fear of being judged by whomever that person happens to encounter.|$|E

Arafiles became aware of the complaint and spoke to Winkler County Sheriff Robert Roberts, alleging that the complaint amounted to harassment. The TMB issued a copy of the complaint to Roberts with the understanding that it would only be used to investigate criminal activity by Arafiles. Roberts sent the complaint to Arafiles and to WCMH administrator Stan Wiley. As WCMH was a small hospital, details from the letter identified Mitchell and Galle as the sources of the complaint.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims at {{reporting}} {{how teachers}} inoculate <b>their</b> students’ <b>identity</b> in <b>their</b> English {{as a foreign}} language (EFL) classes. It is empirically proved that teachers represent <b>their</b> <b>identity</b> and, at the same time, consciously influence their students. This is positively perceived by the students and they further explained that <b>their</b> teacher <b>identity</b> representation influences, to a certain extent, <b>their</b> <b>identity</b> building. However, from the previous studies, there is no yet empirical finding on how the teachers realize <b>their</b> <b>identity.</b> Therefore, investigating the teachers’ effort in inoculating <b>their</b> students’ <b>identity</b> in classroom is really worth doing. The data from the questionnaire and interviewed revealed that teachers have indicated to make any effort to build <b>their</b> students’ <b>identity</b> from the earlier stages of their teaching. It {{is interesting to note}} that these are done through various ways which tend to be sporadically and spontaneously done in classroom interactions. In many cases, the identity shaping functions more as ‘additional values’ which are attached to the material being taught. Some cultural factors are considered effective triggers for the teachers to explore chances to influence <b>their</b> students’ <b>identity.</b> However, a conclusion should be carefully made considering some limitations of the present study...|$|R

Although they are generally more urbanized than Indonesia's indigenous population, significant rural and agricultural communities exist throughout the country.

Emigration has contributed to a shrinking population, and communities have emerged in more industrialized nations {{in the second half of}} the 20th century.

Lewin was seated in 9B, and Suqami was directly behind him in 10B. The 9/11 Commission suggested that Suqami may have stabbed and killed Lewin after he attempted to stop the hijacking. Lewin {{is believed to be the}} first fatality in the 9/11 attacks. During a four-minute call to the American Airlines operations center, Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, lack of access to the cockpit, and passenger injuries.

5|$|Fred Gildersleeve, a Waco-based {{professional}} photographer, {{arrived at}} city hall shortly before the lynching, possibly at the mayor's request, and photographed the event. His photographs provide rare depictions of a lynching in progress, rather than typical lynching photography, which only shows dead victims. Gildersleeve's photographs include views of the crowd shot from a building and close images of Washington's body; some may have been taken by an assistant. Gildersleeve produced postcards featuring images of adolescents, some as young as twelve, gathered around Washington's body. The individuals in the photographs made no attempts to hide <b>their</b> <b>identities.</b> Berg believes that their willingness to be photographed indicates that they knew {{that no one would}} be prosecuted for Washington's death. Although some Waco residents sent the cards to out-of-town relatives, several prominent local citizens persuaded Gildersleeve to stop selling them, fearing that the images would come to characterize the town.|$|E
