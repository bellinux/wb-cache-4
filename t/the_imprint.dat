40|$|A sorbent showing {{specific}} {{affinity for}} nicotine was prepared by molecular imprinting technique, using nicotine as the template, methacrylic acid (MAA) as the functional monomer, ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (EDMA) as the crosslinker and chloroform as the porogen.

On 25 June 1606, the Stationers' Company admitted him as a member. That same day, the Company's court, which had the authority to resolve disputes between members, negotiated a settlement in a lawsuit Barley had brought against East concerning the copyrights on certain music books. East claimed that since he had lawfully entered the books into the Company's register, the rights of the works belonged to him. Barley disagreed, claiming that the works were his through his partnership with Morley, who had held the royal music patent. The court's compromise settlement recognised the rights of both, stipulating that if East were to print an edition of any of the books in question, he was to acknowledge Barley's name on <b>the</b> <b>imprint,</b> pay Barley 20 shillings, and supply him with six free copies. On the other hand, Barley could not publish any of the books without the consent of East or his wife.|$|E

It is soon revealed that the Master Builder is being brought up on charges and that the Halo weapons had been recalled, but one of the rings had gone missing. Bornstellar is called to a Forerunner core planet to testify against the Master Builder, who has been put on trial for crimes against The Mantle, a Forerunner philosophy that values the preservation of life over all else.

Its high selective adsorption and recognition to lysozyme demonstrated the separation ability of <b>the</b> magnetic <b>imprinted</b> material to template molecule, {{and it has been}} used for quick and direct separation of lysozyme from the mixture of standard proteins and real egg white samples under an external magnetic field. Furthermore, the elution of lysozyme from <b>the</b> <b>imprinted</b> material was achieved by PEG/sulphate aqueous two-phase system, which caused lysozyme not only desorption from <b>the</b> <b>imprinted</b> materials but also redistribution in the top and bottom phase of aqueous two-phase system.
