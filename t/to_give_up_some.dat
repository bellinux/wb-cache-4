5|$|In December 1917 the Bolsheviks {{were under}} intense {{pressure}} from the Germans to conclude peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, and Russia Bolshevism was in crisis, with a demoralized army {{and the fate of}} the October Revolution in doubt. Lenin calculated that the Bolsheviks could hold central parts of Russia but had <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> peripheral territories, including Finland in the geopolitically less important north-western corner. As a result, Svinhufvud and his senate delegation won Lenin's concession of sovereignty on 31 December 1917.|$|E
5|$|Later that evening, Jiminy and {{his parents}} {{convince}} a couple <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> goods {{in exchange for a}} tonic that will supposedly make them immune to a plague. He soon discovers that his father switched Rumpelstiltskin's tonic with the one they sold, and finds that the couple have been turned into dolls. Even worse, he then discovers that the couple were the parents of the young boy he spoke to earlier. Having realized what he has done, Jiminy makes a wish and receives an answer from The Blue Fairy, who shows up to give him his one true wish: becoming a cricket. Jiminy is also told that {{he has a chance to}} help someone in the future, starting with the young boy, who would grow up to be Gepetto. As for the cursed dolls, they end up as a collection at Mr. Gold's (Carlyle) pawn shop.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Nuremberg, Hess was {{reluctant}} <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> of his possessions, including samples of food he said had been poisoned by the British; he proposed to use these for his defence during the trial. The commandant of the facility, Colonel Burton C. Andrus of the United States Army, advised {{him that he would}} be allowed no special treatment; the samples were sealed and confiscated. Hess's diaries indicate that he did not acknowledge the validity of the court and felt the outcome was a foregone conclusion. He was thin when he arrived, weighing , and had a poor appetite, but was deemed to be in good health. As one defendant, Robert Ley, had managed to hang himself in his cell on 24 October, the remaining prisoners were monitored around the clock. Because of his previous suicide attempts, Hess was handcuffed to a guard whenever he was out of his cell.|$|E

50|$|To {{cope with}} {{increased}} demand for wireless broadband, increased spectrum would be needed. Studies began in 2009, and while some unused spectrum was available, it appeared broadcasters would have <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> at least <b>some</b> spectrum. This led to strong objections from the broadcasting community. In 2013, auctions were planned, and for now any action by broadcasters is voluntary.|$|R
5|$|Despite the Congress of London's {{verdict in}} 1830, the Dutch {{continued}} to resist Belgian independence {{for much of}} Leopold I's early reign. On 2 August 1831, days after Leopold's coronation, the Dutch launched an invasion known as the Ten Days' Campaign. The 50,000-strong Dutch force crossed the border and rapidly pushed the small Belgian army {{back as far as}} Leuven. Faced with a military disaster, the Belgian government appealed to the French for support. Without international support of their own and faced with an entire French army under General Étienne Gérard, the Dutch withdrew on 12 August. In 1832 the French pushed the Dutch out of Antwerp, their final garrison in Belgium. Much of the city was destroyed in the fighting. Sporadic skirmishes along the border continued until 1839, when the Dutch signed the Treaty of London. The Ten Days' Campaign revealed the fragility of the Belgian position, and although the Dutch finally recognized the independence of Belgium, the Belgians were forced <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> disputed territories, including Zeelandic Flanders and the Duchy of Limburg. Part of Luxembourg, equivalent to the modern state, remained as a semi-independent protectorate of the Dutch until 1890.|$|E
25|$|After several years, a {{deal was}} finally reached, and PennDOT {{acquired}} the necessary land via eminent domain to straighten the road. Homeowners near the campus {{as well as}} a local car wash sold their property to PennDOT for the new right-of-way, which in itself caused controversy. Opponents pointed out how Geneva refused <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> of its land (most of which at the time was underdeveloped) {{while at the same time}} doesn't have to pay taxes to the city.|$|E
25|$|Roanoke Island {{was the key}} {{to control}} of the Sounds.

If the Union established naval superiority there, all points on the mainland shores would be equally vulnerable to assault. The Confederate defenders would be forced into an impossible situation: they would either have <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> positions without a fight, or they would have to spread their assets too thin to be of any use.|$|E

25|$|The idea of freely debating {{rights to}} {{political}} representation took form during the Putney Debates of 1647. Beginning {{in the late}} 17th century, philosophers {{began to think of}} rights not as privileges to be granted by the government or the law, but as a fundamental part {{of what it means to}} be a person. John Locke (1632–1704), one of the most influential of Enlightenment thinkers, argued that property - which to him included life, liberty and possessions - was an unalienable human right, that is, one which cannot be taken away. He articulated that every person is created equal and free but, in return for the advantages of living in an organised society, a person may need <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> of this freedom.|$|E
25|$|On 8 July 2004 the Legislative Council {{passed the}} Education (Amendment) Bill. Under the New Ordinance, {{which would be}} {{effective}} on 1 January 2005, every aided school would be required before 2010 to form an incorporated management committee (IMC) whose members should include elected representatives of teachers, parents of students and alumni, {{as well as other}} independent persons, with a view to promoting a school-based management. It was the concern of the Church that, as a sponsoring body, she would no longer be empowered in the future to supervise the schools under her sponsorship, nor be able to achieve her goals and objectives in Catholic education. On 5 June 2005, Bishop Zen announced that, if the Legislative Council pass the donation to support schools to create incorporated management committees on 8 July 2005, he would appeal against the decision to the court. After the Government decided <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> main argued points, the Diocese decided to support the motion.|$|E
500|$|King Stephen {{had died}} in October 1154, {{bringing}} to an end the long dispute with the Empress Matilda which had helped Anarawd, Cadell and Maredudd to extend their rule in Deheubarth. [...] With disunity within the realm no longer a problem, the new king of England, Henry II, soon {{turned his attention to}} Wales. He began with an invasion of Gwynedd in 1157. This invasion was not entirely successful, but Owain Gwynedd was induced to seek terms and <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> territory in the north-east of Wales.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the great}} stress that existed in Israel in the 1930s, Hushi worried about the {{unemployed}} workers in his city. As {{the secretary of the}} council, Hushi persuaded the other members to establish a staff that would look after the unemployed workers, and provide them with temporary work. The staff would find places of employment and divide the work among the unemployed workers, meaning that full-time workers had <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> on <b>some</b> work time to allow the unemployed people to come in and work. This style of diving work differed from that used in other workers councils used throughout Palestine. Among other things, the organization forced young workers and workers with other options to relinquish their jobs to older, more seasoned workers, who had lost their places of employment.|$|R
40|$|Our {{teaching}} and learning habits are useful {{but they can also}} be deadly. They are useful when the conditions in which they work are predictable and stable. But what happens if and when the bottom falls out of the stable social world in and for which we learn? Is it possible that learning itself - learning as we have come to enact it habitually - may no longer be particularly useful? Could it be that the very habits that have served us so well in stable times might actually become impediments to social success, even to social survival? This paper explores reasons why we may need <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> on <b>some</b> of our deeply held beliefs about {{teaching and}} learning in order to better prepare young people for their social futures...|$|R

Rasul Khan consented, on condition that their lives be spared. Afonso agreed and he left Goa. He did spare the lives of the deserters, but had them horribly mutilated. One such renegade was Fernão Lopes, bound for Portugal in custody, who escaped at the island of Saint Helena and led a 'Robinson Crusoe' life for many years. After such measures the town became the most prosperous Portuguese settlement in India.|$|R
