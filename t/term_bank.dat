We select a sample of firms in the database DIANE and apply data analysis methods and Dissymetricial Correspondence Factorial Analysis. Our results show the interdependence between assets structure and financial structure of firms. Assets structures influence financial structures. Liquid and secured assets improve the access of firms to short <b>term</b> <b>banking</b> loans. Intangible assets are bound to high leverage and low liquidity firms finance more themselves with trade credit. Financial structures influence assets structures too.

50|$|Before {{the credit}} crunch of Summer 2008, several {{leveraged}} buy-outs have seen some secured second-lien <b>term</b> <b>bank</b> loans coming with PIK or, more frequently, PIK toggle features, {{in order to support}} the firm's ability to cover cash interest during the initial period after the leveraged buy-outs. If the acquired company performs well, the PIK toggle feature allows the equity sponsor to avoid giving extraordinary returns to the PIK debt, which might happen if the debt were strictly PIK. The PIK toggle largely disappeared in the wake of {{the credit crunch}}, though in early 2013 there were signs of a tentative comeback. Toward mid-year PIK toggle loans returned in force as the high yield bond market in the U.S. and - relatively speaking - Europe shifted into high gear.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes to}} elect {{the days to}} pay {{accounts}} payable determinants and our findings strongly support that the accounts payable problematic {{is closely related to}} short term financial decisions with a positive and significative influence of firmâ€™s profitability and size factors. The existence of a firmâ€™s negative working capital is confirmed to influence strongly the reduction of the trade credit obtained from suppliers in Western Europe countries in parallel with a joint contribution of short and long <b>term</b> <b>bank</b> financing as a substitute from trade debt. Firm characteristics related to negative working capital and fixed assets level, jointly or alone, give more importance to the role of short <b>term</b> <b>bank</b> financing on substituting or reducing the volume of trade credit obtained from suppliers. Negative working capital reinforces the role of long <b>term</b> <b>bank</b> financing. It seems to induce the presence of a corporate cost reduction strategy to preserve or increment the firmâ€™s market reputation and competition. The firmâ€™s return on assets implies an enlargement of the days to pay accounts payable in line with a rising creditworthiness. All interacted variables are responsible for the reduction of the days to pay accounts payable and the confirmation of the financial substitution effect introduces more financing discipline compatible with firmâ€™s cost reduction strategy and pricing motives included in a price discriminatio...|$|E

40|$|The {{allocation}} of credit by banks on 'soft' terms {{to friends and}} relatives - often termed cronyism - {{rather than on the}} basis of 'hard' market criteria in the years leading up to the Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 98 has been hypothesized as an important cause of the crisis. These practices had their basis in the implicit guarantees provided by the government to banks, which in turn percolated down to firms having 'crony' ties to banks as soft-budget constraints for projects of uncertain quality. Such soft-budget constraints should be reflected in preferential access to long <b>term</b> <b>bank</b> credit for firms with close ties to banks. Using pre-crisis data on borrowing patterns in Thailand we find that firms with crony ties to banks and politicians had greater access to long-term debt than firms without such ties. Surprisingly, we find that a broad range of standard firm characteristics suggested as important factors by the literature on firm finance play a much less significant role in explaining the {{allocation of}} long <b>term</b> <b>bank</b> credit. Consequently, it is difficult to avoid the interpretation that 'cronyism' was by far the main driver of pre-crisis lending patterns. ...|$|E
40|$|Credit {{rationing}} is by many Keynesian economists nowadays {{seen as one}} of {{the most}} important examples of market failure in a modern capitalistic economy. Credit rationing occurs if in equilibrium the demand for loans exceeds the supply at the ruling price (interest rate). Since (Belgian) SMEs heavily rely on bank finance, this restricted access to bank finance could have a negative effect on the investment in new profitable projects and growth of the economy. Due to the lack of empirical research in this domain, we study the empirical significance of credit rationing for SMEs in a Belgian (bank based) context for the period 1993 - 2001. The novelty of our research consists of the distinction we make between credit rationing for long and short <b>term</b> <b>bank</b> credit. Moreover, in contrast to the numerous previous studies, pioneered by Fazzari et al. (1988), we opt for an endogenous classification into â€˜credit rationed â€™ and â€˜non credit rationedâ€™ firms, allowing for switching between both groups throughout time. An extensive panel data set consisting of 2. 698 SMEs reporting data over the period 1993 - 2001 is used to estimate the demand-supply disequilibrium model for long and short <b>term</b> <b>bank</b> debt.

40|$|The {{allocation}} of credit by banks and financial institutions on 'soft' terms {{to friends and}} relatives {{rather than on the}} basis of 'hard' market criteria in the years leading up to the East Asian crisis of 1997 - 98 has been widely noted. Using a detailed dataset on Thai firms prior to the crisis period we examine whether business connections were in fact a good predictor of preferential access to long <b>term</b> <b>bank</b> credit. We find that firms with connections to banks and politicians had greater access to long-term debt than firms without such ties. Connected firms need much less collateral to obtain long term loans than those without connections. Such firms obtain more long term loans, and appear to use less short term loans. We do not find support for the existence of connections between banks and firms serving to reduce asymmetric information problems. Our results thus lend support to the hypothesis that the presence of connections was the most important factor determining access to long <b>term</b> <b>bank</b> debt prior to the financial crisis and are consistent with recent research implicating weak corporate governance in the extent and severity of the crisis.

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsAllen M. FeatherstoneThe Agriculture Equipment Manufacturing {{industry}} is a $ 42 billion dollar industry in the United States. The Agricultural Equipment {{industry is}} very competitive across all market segments, especially in the less than 100 horsepower category (< 100 hp). This tractor category consists of 4 sub categories: < 20 hp, 20 - 40 hp, 40 - 60 hp, and 60 - 100 hp. The < 100 hp tractor segment accounted for 170, 547 of the 207, 833 tractors that were sold during the 2014 year. Compared to the over 100 horsepower category (100 +hp) that has fewer competitors, the < 100 hp segment is more competitive with more manufacturers competing for market share. Company XYZ is a full line manufacturer of agricultural equipment, harvesters, and construction equipment. Company XYZ lost some ground in market share due to {{the increased competition from}} new entrants into the market place as well as established manufacturers increasing their presence. To be more competitive, Company XYZ is looking at industry best practices to see how they can increase market share. One of these practices is a <b>terms</b> <b>bank.</b> A <b>terms</b> <b>bank</b> allows a dealer to stockpile unused months of terms to be used at a later date on tractors with expired terms. This minimizes financial risk for dealers to stock inventory. The cost to stock inventory is a large expense that dealers must carefully manage. One of the biggest costs of stocking inventory is the interest paid for tractors that have exhausted their interest free <b>terms.</b> A <b>terms</b> <b>bank</b> may lower the amount of interest that a dealer pays. It also lowers the cost to stock inventory and allows the dealership to manage and reduce these costs and risks. Evaluating the factors associated with stocking inventory, especially interest rate, will help manage inventory costs and stocking levels. This thesis uses regression analyses to analyze the costs of stocking units and the effect it has on dealership revenues. A regression analysis will test the hypothesis that lowering the interest portion of the cost of stocking inventory will increase sales. Data were gathered for dealership groups in the Western United States on a monthly basis for the years 2008 â€“ 2014. The results supported the hypothesis that lowering the interest rate at dealerships was positively correlated with revenues. The reduced interest cost lowers the carrying cost of inventory and point to a <b>terms</b> <b>bank</b> being an effective tool for increasing Company XYZâ€™s market share...|$|R
