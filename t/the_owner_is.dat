5|$|Although it {{was found}} {{shattered}} into thousands of pieces and is now heavily corroded, the helmet still bears evidence of its original finely decorated design. It was plated with silver-gilt and decorated with images of goddesses and equestrian scenes. It would {{have been used by}} a Roman auxiliary cavalryman for displays and possibly in battle. The identity of <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> <b>is</b> not known but the helmet was discovered on a native British ceremonial site, buried alongside thousands of Iron Age British and Roman coins. It is possible that the helmet was owned by a Briton who fought alongside the Romans during the conquest of Britain.|$|E
5|$|Their {{high energy}} and drive make these dogs {{ideally suited to}} a number of {{different}} dog sports such as flyball or agility. Obedience classes are also recommended to potential owners, as Jack Russells can be stubborn at times and aggressive towards other animals and humans if not properly socialized. Despite their small size, these dogs are not recommended for the condominium or apartment dweller unless <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> <b>is</b> ready to take on the daunting task of providing the dog with the necessary amount of exercise and stimulation. They have a tremendous amount of energy for their size, a fact which can sometimes lead to trouble involving larger animals. They may seem never to tire and will still be energetic after their owner has called it a day. While socialised members of the breed are friendly towards children, they will not tolerate abuse even if it is unintentional.|$|E

50|$|This two-storey Baroque mansion {{was built}} {{in the first half of}} the 18th century on two parcels of medieval land.

25|$|A search {{concluded}} that there was no T. Keane missing in any English-speaking country and a nationwide circulation of the dry-cleaning marks also proved fruitless. In fact, all that could be garnered from the suitcase was that since a coat in the suitcase had a front gusset and featherstitching, it could have been made only in the United States, as this was the only country that possessed the machinery for that stitch. Although mass-produced, the body work is done when <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> <b>is</b> fitted before it is completed.

25|$|Where the finder is an employee, {{most cases}} hold that the find should be {{awarded to the}} {{employer}} {{if it has a}} heightened legal obligation to take care of its customers' property, otherwise it should go to the employee. A find occurring in a bank is generally awarded to the bank as <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> <b>is</b> likely to have been a bank customer and the bank has a fiduciary duty to try to reunite lost property with their owners. For similar reasons, common carriers are preferred to passengers and hotels to guests (but only where finds occur in guest rooms, not common areas). The view has been taken that such a rule is suitable for recently misplaced objects as it provides the best chance for them to be reunited with their owners. However, it effectively delivers title of old artefacts to landowners, since the older an object is, the less likely it is that the original depositor will return to claim it. The rule is therefore of little or no relevance to objects of archaeological value.|$|E

25|$|Pyometra (or a pus filled womb) ('Pyo' = pus; 'metra' = uterus or womb) is a {{life-threatening}} condition that requires emergency veterinary treatment. The {{risk of a}} non-spayed bitch developing pyometra by age 10 is 25% across all breeds, but can {{be as high as}} 54% in some breeds. The treatment of choice for a closed-pyometra (where the cervix is closed and the pus cannot drain) is admission to hospital, commencement on intravenous fluids and appropriate antibiotics and, once stable enough for the anaesthetic and surgery, emergency removal of the infected pus-filled uterus. Medical management can be attempted if the animal's condition allows (for example {{in the case of an}} 'open' pyometra where the pus drains per-vaginum from the uterus via the open cervix) or dictates (where the animal is too old or otherwise unwell to withstand surgery), if the owner wishes to keep the dog entire to breed or if <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> <b>is</b> unable to afford the veterinary fees associated with surgery. Emergency removal of the infected uterus carries a much higher degree of risk of death than a routine 'spay' operation. The risk of death from in dogs undergoing surgical treatment for pyometra is up to 17%. Thus the risk of death in entire female dogs from a pyometra, even if given correct veterinary attention can be up to 9% by 10 years of age (17% of 54%). This risk is reduced to virtually zero if spayed.|$|E
500|$|The owners or {{managers}} of a National Treasure {{are responsible for}} the administration and [...] restoration of the work. [...] Should the property be lost, destroyed, damaged, altered, moved, or ownership be transferred, they must advise the Agency for Cultural affairs. Alterations to the property require a permit, and the agency is to be notified 30 days in advance when repairs are conducted.(§43). [...] If requested, owners must supply information, and report to the commissioner of the Agency for Cultural Affairs, regarding the condition of the property (§54). If a National Treasure is damaged, the commissioner has the authority to order the owner or custodian to repair the property; if <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> <b>is</b> non-compliant, the commissioner may carry out repairs. If a National Treasure is to be sold, the government retains the first option to buy the item (§46). Transfers of National Treasures are generally restrictive, and export is prohibited.|$|E
500|$|Important {{cultural}} {{properties that}} show truly exceptional workmanship, a particularly high value for world cultural history, or an exceptional value to scholarship can be designated as [...] "National Treasures." [...] In {{order to achieve}} the designation, the owner of an important cultural property contacts or is contacted by the Agency for Cultural Affairs for information regarding the registration. In the latter case, the agency always asks the owner for consent beforehand, even though not required by law. The agency then contacts the Council for Cultural Affairs, which consists of five members appointed by the minister of education for their [...] "wide and [...] eminent views on and knowledge of culture." [...] The council may seek support from an investigative commission and eventually prepares {{a report to the}} Agency for Cultural Affairs. If they support the nomination, the property is placed on the registration list of cultural properties, <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> <b>is</b> informed of the outcome, and an announcement is made in the official gazette. The designation policy is deliberately restrained, keeping the number of designated properties low. In this respect the South Korean protective system {{is similar to that of}} Japan. In the 21st century, up to five properties were designated every year.|$|E
50|$|Lacking written {{evidence}} {{we can only}} guess at the identity of <b>the</b> various <b>owners</b> of <b>the</b> house during the 400 years or so of Roman occupation.

Moreover, <b>the</b> references to the sea in the figurative mosaics suggest that <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> possibly connected with the fish trade, for examples a fish exporter.

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from July 30, 1910. It states: [...] "John Gary runs a summer hotel at a charming spot on the seashore, {{but he has been}} unable to induce people to stop there, and {{at the opening of the}} picture he is seen lamenting the fact that there is not a single guest name on his hotel register. At this juncture his daughter Ethel returns from school. Ethel is an expert swimmer, and on reading in the paper the rumor that a mermaid has made several appearances in the water of the Atlantic, he decides to have his daughter pose as the mysterious lady of the sea. He wisely conjectures that a handy mermaid will bring guests. With Ethel clad in appropriate costume, and seated upon the rocks in true mermaid fashion, her father persuades the reporter of the local paper to take a look at the phenomenon. The newspaper man is greatly impressed with the spectacle and obtains a photo of the mermaid, which he publishes. The mermaid gains wide publicity - and vacationists arrive from near and far to see her. Tom, Dick and Harry, a trio of city sports, jump into bathing suits and the water, each bent on capturing the mermaid. She eludes them all, however, and the mystery is not cleared up until Ethel, in a pre-tailored suit, presents herself to the guests and explains the joke. By this time Gary's hotel is famous and <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> <b>is</b> certain of a big summer business." ...|$|E
