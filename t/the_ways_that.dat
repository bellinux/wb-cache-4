Congress shelved the report without much debate (except for Madison's objection to Hamilton's formulation of the General Welfare clause, which Hamilton construed liberally as a legal basis for his extensive programs).|$|E

40|$|This {{chapter is}} {{concerned}} with the dynamics of social norms, <b>that</b> is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> such norms change. In particular this chapter concentrates on the lifecycle that social norms go through, focusing on the generation of norms, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> norms spread and stabilize, and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> norms evolve. We also discuss the cognitive mechanisms behind norm compliance, the role of culture in norm dynamics, and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> trust affects norm dynamics...|$|R

It was evident that the gene must be ancient, dating back to the last common ancestor of bilateral animals (before the Ediacaran Period, which began some 635 million years ago).

For example, he published a meta-analysis showing that on average, homosexual men and women recall being much more gender nonconforming children, compared with heterosexual children. In contrast, he also showed that for many traits related to mating (such as interest in casual sex, and emphasis on a partner's physical attractiveness), homosexuals appear {{to be similar to}} heterosexuals of their own sex.

25|$|Materialist {{feminism}} {{has been}} criticized for assuming universal oppression of women. By focusing on capitalist relations combined with patriarchy, materialist feminism fails to include women of different classes, sexualities and ethnicities.

25|$|A major {{influence}} on modern spirituality was the Theosophical Society, which searched for 'secret teachings' in Asian religions. It has been influential on modernist streams in several Asian religions, notably Neo-Vedanta, {{the revival of}} Theravada Buddhism, and Buddhist modernism, which have taken over modern western notions of personal experience and universalism and integrated them in their religious concepts. A second, related influence was Anthroposophy, whose founder, Rudolf Steiner, was particularly interested in developing a genuine Western spirituality, and in <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> such a spirituality could transform practical institutions such as education, agriculture, and medicine.|$|E

Linguists call different ways of speaking language varieties, a term that encompasses geographically or socioculturally defined dialects as well as the jargons or styles of subcultures.
