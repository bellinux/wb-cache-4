The 53-count, 65-page {{indictment}} covers {{a broad range of}} financial crimes, including bank fraud, making false statements to banks and auditors, securities fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, conspiracy, and insider trading. United States District Judge Sim Lake had previously denied motions by the defendants to have separate trials and to relocate the case out of Houston, where the defendants argued the negative publicity concerning Enron's demise would make it impossible <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> trial. On May 25, 2006, the jury in the Lay and Skilling trial returned its verdicts. Skilling was convicted of 19 of 28 counts of securities fraud and wire fraud and acquitted on the remaining nine, including charges of insider trading. He was sentenced to 24 years and 4 months in prison. In 2013 the United States Department of Justice reached a deal with Skilling, which resulted in ten years being cut from his sentence.|$|E

[...] "The Clanton brothers and the McLowrys were a tough lot of rustlers who were the main perpetrators of the rascailly rife in that region.

60|$|It {{seemed that}} the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon {{speaking}} a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised {{of the existence of}} Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardor to encounter him; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity, despite all the archangel's denunciations and forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat. With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat's bow, and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale, and essaying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> chance for his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen.

They fired a couple of hundred shot altogether, and at midday they stopped--for dinner, I suppose--and did not begin again. I suspect they were running short of ammunition. Once, when the firing was hottest, thinking, I suppose, to catch us napping, an attempt was made to climb the ladder; but Dunlop, who was on watch, put a bullet through the first fellow's head, and by the yell that followed I suspect that in his fall he swept all the others off the ladder. Anyhow, there was no repetition of the trial.

40|$|Cue: Why is it {{that farmers}} in much of Africa find {{they have to pay}} five times the price for {{fertilizers}} than farmers {{in the rest of the}} world? It is certainly not because they are the most affluent! In <b>an</b> attempt <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairer</b> deal for farmers in Ghana ? in whichever region they are farming - an association of private sector dealers has been formed. It?s called the Ghana Agri-Inputs Dealers Association and it?s based in Tamale. You might think that such an association might be bad news for farmers but Mark Kamilung, its president, says that when farmers are in business, so are the input dealers. He tells Sarah Reynolds about the problems that association members face. IN:		?The major problem is that... OUT:		... we shall overcome the problems. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 57 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mark Kamilung of Ghana?s Agri-Inputs Dealers Association. Transcript Kamilung	The major problem is that they are lacking working capital, the business capital to expand their work. Because agricultural inputs are very costly and they are in bulk. So they need money to expand. And I think the second problem is that most of the members need technical knowledge in the inputs that they deal in. Especially they have to know their right pesticides, and then to dish it out to the farmers in the right quantities. These are some of the problems we are trying to address Reynolds	So your members are both large and small businesses are they? Kamilung	Yes, we have very large dealers and very small dealers. There are some dealers who even control up to one billion cedis worth of business and some control as small as about half a million cedi business but they are all growing up. And then we are aiming to create a very competitive market. What do I mean by a competitive market? That prices will be almost at the same at all places to all farmers and that inputs will be at the doorsteps of farmers. Reynolds	But that can?t happen surely when you?ve got some distributors up in Tamale which is a long way from the port ? which is where the fertilisers ? if we take fertilisers ? are coming in? Kamilung	Yes, that is the major constraint now. Yes, you are very, very right. Because of infrastructure development, roads are very bad so transportation cost is very high. If you take on a per tonne basis, the amount you pay from Europe to Africa or to the port at Tema is the same thing as from Accra to Tamale within the same country. Reynolds	That seems complete nonsense, doesn?t it? Kamilung	Yes it is. And the farmer is the loser at the end. Because every overhead, every handling cost is finally shifted to the farmer who is the final consumer and that is actually affecting agriculture. Reynolds	But it does sound though as if there are people between the importers and the farmers ? the users ? in other words your members, who are perhaps being a little bit greedy? Kamilung	Oh yes there are. They also do so. People capitalize on the lack of certain inputs in very far places in the country and over price. Sometimes they fix their margins which is very bad. And this is one of the big exercises that the association is trying to carry out ? to try to educate members at least to fix reasonable margins. It?s true. Some of the members are capitalizing on the situation. Reynolds	But what sanction have you got other than taking away their membership? Kamilung	Well we are liaising with the Ministry of Agriculture, governmental organizations that we can caution such members when they go outside our guidelines and then if they continue, with the help of government, we can ban them completely. Reynolds	Now the other big problem that I?ve always heard that the dealers are accused of ? or maybe it?s the importers, you must tell me ? is the question of timing. So that farmers in one region wanting to put fertilizers or other agricultural inputs ? crop protection materials ? on their crops ? and there is a small window of time in which they can do it - and the products are simply not available in the shops and stalls and markets for them <b>to</b> <b>get</b> there. Are you as an association doing anything to address this problem? Kamilung	It is very, very true. That is one of the reasons why the association has been formed. In the past it was so. Sometimes when farmers need to apply a compound and it doesn?t come at the right time. When it?s time to apply nitrogen fertilizer like urea or sulphate of ammonia ? the same thing. With the formation of the association we have created regional branches to make sure that at least the movement of inputs to farmers? doorsteps before the beginning of rains. We are also liaising with the big importers that they should always have some buffer stock especially at their regional warehouses so that it can be pushed very fast to our dealers who also push it to the farmers. This is one of the biggest reasons why we created the association. And we are working hand in hand with the big importers and we hope in time we shall overcome the problems. End of track.

40|$|Written by Whitlam, {{passed by}} Fraser, the Northern Territory Land Rights Act is falling victim to ill-considered amendments, writes Sean Brennan THERE are {{telltale}} signs when ideology overrides common sense in making new laws. Government tries to ram changes through quickly, {{under the radar}} of public and media scrutiny. The process looks dodgy and words in the law mean {{the opposite of what}} they say. Even long-term allies and kindred spirits cannot conceal their discomfort and unease. That is precisely what is going on this week with proposed amendments to the Northern Territory Land Rights Act. This is Australia’s high water mark in land rights legislation. Whitlam introduced it in 1975 and Fraser ensured it went through the following year. For a long time it enjoyed bipartisan support and both sides of politics are rightly proud of what the law has achieved, including the return of half the Territory to traditional ownership. The Howard government wants to make some of the most dramatic changes to that law in its thirty year life. Some of the amendments reflect the public policy process at its best. Some show a government using parliament like a doormat. It is ignoring advice on all sides to slow down and bring people on board over issues that everyone can agree on. The Bill proposes a range of reforms. Many result from extended consultation and negotiation. As a result, changes to streamline agreement-making about mining on Aboriginal land enjoy broad support. They show that land councils and miners are just as interested as governments in facilitating appropriate economic development for Aboriginal people on their land. Sadly other parts of the package have not been approached in the same spirit. The proposal to grant head leases over Aboriginal townships to government entities for 99 years is about improved housing and economic development, according to the Minister Mal Brough. These are objectives no one disagrees with. So it is unfortunate that the Commonwealth has reverted to a “government knows best” attitude, something that has failed in indigenous affairs almost every time it has been tried. Instead of adopting the partnership approach it took to mining changes, the government has simply bolted the leasing proposals onto the Bill. Brough says leasing is voluntary, but no one is buying that and indications to the contrary are already coming in from the Top End. Flaws in the process show up in the content of the law. The terms of the leasing deal are stacked against traditional owners, in favour of the government. On the floor of parliament Brough had to ditch his initial plan for an arbitrary limit on the rent Aboriginal people could charge. But other restrictions on the ability of traditional owners <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> deal remain. Why tie the hands of traditional owners in lease negotiations if the whole objective is to promote an enterprise culture? Meanwhile, last-minute changes of major proportions are still being made. The Northern Territory government, which is central to whole plan, had only three days to comment on the legislation. Like all cases of policy on the run you have to wonder what the rush is really about. The Bill also makes it possible for the Commonwealth minister to break up existing land councils into smaller, less powerful organisations. Again these are unilateral measures and reflect long-standing ideological views about the strength of existing Aboriginal organisations. They run counter to the Commonwealth’s drive elsewhere for consolidation and economies of scale in native title and Aboriginal legal services. That mismatch was pointed out by the Minerals Council of Australia. When the miners side with land councils against the government, it is a sure sign that government ideology about indigenous affairs is trumping workability and genuine stakeholder interest. When the government goes further and adopts the doublespeak of “delegation” to describe the stripping of core functions from land councils by the minister, it becomes even clearer that the Senate must not pass this law in its current form. The government used the guillotine procedure to cut off debate in the lower house, after less than three hours. A Senate committee had a one day hearing and a few days to write a report. Government senators said the process was “totally inadequate” and “such fundamentally important legislation should have bipartisan support with broad consensus among stakeholders affected”. At present half the Bill has that and the other half is nowhere near that point. The Bill is before the Senate. Either it should be split so that the consensus provisions can pass or the entire law should be deferred, so that more sensible proposals for achieving its objectives can be agreed upon by all stakeholders. • Sean Brennan is a project director at the Gilbert +Tobin Centre of Public Law at UNSW Law School.
