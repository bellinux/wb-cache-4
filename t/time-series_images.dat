In this study, a framework for data mining from a set of <b>time-series</b> <b>images</b> including moving objects was presented. <b>Time-series</b> <b>images</b> are transformed into time-series cluster addresses by using clustering by two-stage SOM (Self-organizing map) and time-dependent association rules were extracted from it. Semantically indexed data and extracted rules are stored in the object-relational database, which al-lows high-level queries by entering SQL through the user interface. This method was applied to weather satellite cloud images taken by GMS- 5 and its usefulness was evaluated. ...|$|E

Then the algorithm was applied to RADARSAT <b>time-series</b> <b>images,</b> and synchronous field surveying was performed for validation.

40|$|Abandonment of {{agricultural}} land {{is a global}} issue and a waste of resources and brings {{a negative impact on}} the local economy. It {{is also one of the}} key contributing factors in certain environmental problems, such as soil erosion and carbon sequestration. In order to address such problems related to land abandonment, their spatial distribution must first be precisely identified. Hence, this study proposes the use of multi-temporal Landsat imageries, together with crop phenology information and an object-oriented classification technique, to identify abandoned paddy and rubber areas. Results indicate that Landsat <b>time-series</b> <b>images</b> were highly beneficial and, in fact, essential in identifying abandoned paddy and rubber areas, particularly due to the unique phenology of these seasonal crops. To differentiate between abandoned and non-abandoned paddy areas, a minimum of three <b>time-series</b> <b>images,</b> mainly acquired during the planting seasons is required. For rubber, multi-temporal images should be examined in order to confirm the wintering season. The study demonstrates the advantages of using multi-temporal Landsat imageries in identifying abandoned paddy and rubber areas wherein an accuracy of 93. 33 % ± 14 % and 83. 33 % ± 1 %, respectively, were achieved...|$|E

The final model is trained by the selected large and high quality training dataset. We perform two comparison experiments with 38 25 -m resolution ENVISAT ASAR images. Using the proposed method, we achieved 90. 2 % minima accuracy and a 0. 725 minima Kappa coefficient, which are much higher than those of the three conventional methods. Thus, the accuracy and stability of built-up area extraction are significantly improved.

To {{demonstrate}} blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) of vascular oxygen-ation changes in normal, unanesthetized human retinas associ-ated with oxygen and carbogen challenge.

As the state of the system being monitored and many sensors are affected by the environmental conditions changing with time, the multi sensor fusion requires a correlation-dependent approach. The behavior of this approach should vary according to the correlation parameter. In this paper, we compare our possibilistic correlation-dependent fusion approach (PCDF) with the possiblistic combiner Dempster-Shafer. We focus in this paper on the mathematical background of this approach {{so that it can be}} used in many useful applications.

In this paper, {{we propose}} a generic {{framework}} for intersubject non-linear registration of 4 D <b>time-series</b> <b>images.</b> In this framework, spatio-temporal registration {{is defined by}} mapping trajectories of physical points as opposed to spatial registration that solely aims at mapping homologous points. First, we determine the trajectories we want to register in each sequence using a motion tracking algorithm based on the Diffeomorphic Demons algorithm. Then, we perform simultaneously pairwise registrations of corresponding time-points with the constraint to map the same physical points over time. We show this trajectory registration can be formulated as a multichannel registration of 3 D images. We solve it using the Diffeomorphic Demons algorithm extended to vector-valued 3 D images. This framework {{is applied to the}} inter-subject non-linear registration of 4 D cardiac CT sequences. ...|$|E

Methodology/Principal Findings: We developed a new optical imaging-based strategy for quantitative {{measurement of}} peripheral tissue perfusion by time-series analysis of local pharmacokinetics of the NIR fluorophore, indocyanine green (ICG). <b>Time-series</b> NIR fluorescence <b>images</b> were obtained after injecting ICG intravenously in a murine hindlimb ischemia model.

40|$|Most areas {{planted with}} {{sugarcane}} {{are located in}} southern China. However, remote sensing of sugarcane has been limited because useable remote sensing data are limited due to the cloudy climate of this region {{during the growing season}} and severe spectral mixing with other crops. In this study, we developed a methodology for automatically mapping sugarcane over large areas using time-series middle-resolution remote sensing data. For this purpose, two major techniques were used, the object-oriented method (OOM) and data mining (DM). In addition, time-series Chinese HJ- 1 CCD images were obtained during the sugarcane growing period. Image objects were generated using a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm, and DM was implemented using the AdaBoost algorithm, which generated the prediction model. The prediction model was applied to the HJ- 1 CCD <b>time-series</b> <b>image</b> objects, and then a map of the sugarcane planting area was produced. The classification accuracy was evaluated using independent field survey sampling points. The confusion matrix analysis showed that the overall classification accuracy reached 93. 6 % and that the Kappa coefficient was 0. 85.

It allows prediction at a finer spatial resolution than that of the input imagery, based on either (i) assumptions or prior knowledge about the character of the target spatial variation coupled with spatial optimisation, (ii) spatial prediction through interpolation or (iii) direct information on the relation between spatial resolutions {{in the form of a}} regression model. Two classes of goal can be distinguished based on whether continua are predicted (through downscaling or area-to-point prediction) or categories are predicted (super-resolution mapping), in both cases from continuous input data. This paper reviews a range of techniques for both goals, focusing on area-to-point kriging and downscaling cokriging in the former case and spatial optimisation techniques and multiple point geostatistics in the latter case. Several issues are discussed including the information content of training data, including training images, the need for model-based uncertainty information to accompany downscaling predictions, and the fundamental limits on the representativeness of downscaling predictions.
