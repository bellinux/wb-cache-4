Knox did not agree, and declined a suggestion that he go to Peking to view <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>on</b> the ground. Taft considered Roosevelt's minister there, William W. Rockhill, as uninterested in the China trade, and replaced him with William J. Calhoun, whom McKinley and Roosevelt had sent on several foreign missions. Knox did not listen to Calhoun on policy, and there were often conflicts. Taft and Knox tried unsuccessfully to extend John Hay's Open Door Policy to Manchuria.|$|E

500|$|According to Rives (1999), {{the fact}} that the ancient Germanic peoples claimed descent from an earth-born god was used by Tacitus to support [...] his {{contention}} that they were an indigenous population: the Latin word indigena was often used in the same sense as the Greek autochthonos, meaning literally ' the land itself'. Lindauer (1975) notes that, although this claim is to be judged as one made out of simple ignorance of <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>on</b> the part of Tacitus, he was not entirely wrong, as he made the judgement based on a comparison with the relatively turbulent Mediterranean region of his day.|$|E

Giving judgment in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, Lord Justice Harry Woolf held that an oral hearing may not always be the [...] "very pith of the administration of natural justice".

[...] The argument went on for months, but Helms finally OK'd a report saying that PAVN troop levels were 299,000 or less.

2500|$|Under heavy pressure, Sócrates {{provided}} {{his version}} of <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>on</b> Wednesday 11 April 2007 in a live broadcast interview for the RTP 1 TV channel and RDP radio. The Prime Minister stated he was not favoured by the Universidade Independente to obtain the degree, declared {{he had been the}} target of [...] "catty accusations", and defended the authenticity of the degree, though admitting he is not a fully chartered civil engineer. In his official biography at the Portuguese Government's official website Sócrates claimed to have already obtained the qualification of engineer. He later admitted that this was a [...] "lapse", and the government website altered his CV, downgrading [...] "civil engineer" [...] to [...] "diploma in civil engineering". In the interest of accuracy, he should have used [...] "licenciado em engenharia civil" [...] instead of [...] "engenheiro". Before he had been granted the degree, he presented himself as an [...] "engineer" [...] when he was solely a [...] "technical engineer". Portuguese Parliament documents with official information on Sócrates personal data were found, proving such inconsistencies. Sócrates and his staff replied to this by stating that it was probably a misunderstanding in the parliamentary services. After having the licenciatura diploma he used the title [...] "engineer" [...] in several official documents, despite the fact that his unaccredited degree in civil engineering from Universidade Independente was not legally recognized to allow {{for the use of the}} title [...] "engineer"; a profession which is regulated in Portugal by the Ordem dos Engenheiros.|$|E

60|$|Fallacies of Induction, where <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>on</b> {{which the}} {{induction}} proceeds are erroneous, may be termed Fallacies of Observation. The term is not strictly accurate, or, rather, not accurately co-extensive {{with the class}} of fallacies which I propose to designate by it. Induction is not always grounded on facts immediately observed, but sometimes on facts inferred; and when these last are erroneous, the error may not be, in the literal sense of the term, an instance of bad observation, but of bad inference. It will be convenient, however, to make only one class of all the inductions of which the error lies in not sufficiently ascertaining <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>on</b> which the theory is grounded; whether the cause of failure be malobservation, or simple non-observation, and whether the malobservation be direct, or by means of intermediate marks which do not prove what {{they are supposed to}} prove.
