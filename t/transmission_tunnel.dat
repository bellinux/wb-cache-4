The otherwise comfy seats move fore and aft, but the rake is fixed, which can be-and was for me-a real pain. Speaking of driver discomforts, there's no dead pedal for your left foot, and your right thigh gets a good grilling from the aluminum <b>transmission</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The snap-shut side curtains cannot be raised or lowered like conventional windows, so you're either freezing or sweltering." ...|$|E

50|$|From July 1981 to September 1982, German RS dealers marketed {{a limited}} edition, Zakspeed inspired, {{left-hand}} drive only, 'Werksturbo' model capable of 220 km/h. Based on the 3.0 S, this derivative featured widened Series X bodywork, {{front and rear}} 'Ford Motorsport' badged spoilers, deep 7.5j four-spoked RS alloy wheels fitted with Pirelli P7 235/60VR13 tyres and an RS badged engine. The engine {{was based on a}} normally aspirated carburetor equipped 2.8-litre Cologne V6, Ford Granada (Europe) engine using electronic ignition, a tuftrided crankshaft, heavy duty head gaskets and oil pump, an oil cooler and a single Garrett T4 turbocharger providing 5.4 psi of boost, a limited slip differential, Bilstein dampers all around, an anti dive kit, uprated RS anti roll bars and single rear leaf springs, the engine put out 188 Hp at 5500rpm.

2500|$|The entire car is {{essentially}} handmade, {{with the car}} being completely stripped and re-built from the chassis up. Engineers reinforced and stiffened the chassis seam welding in key {{areas such as the}} door seams and door frames and added carbon fibre to the strut towers and <b>transmission</b> <b>tunnel</b> and the engine bay, completely redesigning the suspension, drivetrain, engine, gearbox and other components so as to work at maximum efficiency and reliability as is expected of a road-going vehicle. Although Nismo planned on building 20 cars, they ceased production on only 19 (including 2 prototypes). The Z-tune is often regarded as the most expensive (prices for some have been known to exceed [...] ) street legal GT-R ever built.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the launch there had been {{speculation}} within the media that the Rover 75 used the BMW 5 Series platform, perhaps due to the overall size of the model, the apparent presence of a <b>transmission</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{and the use of the}} parent company's rear suspension system. This was in fact not the case: Rover engineers had used the concept of incorporating a central tunnel which had been explored by BMW as part of their own research into front-wheel-drive chassis design. As the 75 took shape, this core engineering was passed over to Rover and evolved into the Rover 75 structure [...] The tunnel concept, along with the rear suspension system, was also used by the Rover engineers for the design of the Mini.|$|E
2500|$|The rising {{commercial}} {{success of the}} Rally package made VAM ascend it to a trim level for 1972 and with that several improvements followed. The safety mechanism connecting the shifter to the ignition switch was discontinued, which meant the incorporation of a small safety lever {{on the side of}} the column to keep the ignition switch from accidentally turning into lock position with the vehicle in motion. The previously optional 8000 RPM tachometer became standard equipment along with AMC's new three-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central cylindrical button. Low-back, smaller more bucket-like front reclining seats replaced the wide units of the previous two years, which meant a free space between both units over the <b>transmission</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The round floor shift base shared with 1968-1969 Javelins departed in favor of a new squared design. The bright rear panel got an aluminum turned appearance and the taillight lenses featured a new larger backup light and side stripes. The grille was changed from aluminum to plastic and an updated hood latch appeared. Mechanically, the front sway bar was passed on to the standard equipment list, but the biggest change of the year was present under the hood. The 1972 Rally engine was the VAM 252 six producing [...] at 4,600 rpm, 9.5:1 compression ratio, with a high-flow Carter RBS-PV1 single-barrel carburetor and the 266 degree camshaft, which was originally used in 1969-1970 VAM Javelins. Due to this, the [...] "232 SIX" [...] emblems were removed in favor of new [...] "252" [...] units.|$|E

40|$|With the {{widespread}} commercial {{use of the}} Internet, secure data communications over the Internet has become {{an important aspect of}} business operations. Thus, it is an important study for information technology and management students. The Security Protocol Game is an interactive group activity for exploring secure data communication protocols. Using pen and paper, envelopes and game tokens, students simulate security protocols and possible attacks against them. The game provides simple and intuitive representations for cryptographic methods, including both public key and secret key techniques. Using these representations, students can simulate Internet application protocols such as Pretty Good Privacy (used to secure email) and Transport Layer Security (used for secure web transactions). They can explore well-known protocols for authentication, key exchange and blind signatures. Students can also develop and test their own protocols using public key certificates, encrypted key <b>transmission,</b> <b>tunnelling</b> and other well-known techniques. Through this learning activity, students gain a deep understanding of how security protocols operate and are designed. The game has been used in tertiary units of study for managers and information technology students...|$|R
2500|$|The {{government}} {{plans to}} tap the Awali River to the Southeast of Beirut to provide the growing capital with 90 million m3/year of additional water, {{more than double the}} current resources. The project involves the construction of a dam at Bisri, a 3km tunnel from the river to a new water treatment plant at Ouardaniye, and a second 22km tunnel to Khalde south of Beirut, from where water will be transported through two twin pipelines, one going North to the center of Beirut and the second northeast to Baabda. The Islamic Development Bank has agreed to finance the construction of Bisri dam in 2008, while the World Bank has approved a US$200m loan [...] in December 2010 to partly finance the <b>transmission</b> <b>tunnels</b> and pipelines. Lebanese critics of the project argue that the Awali River and especially the Litani River, from which water is diverted to the Awali River upstream of the planned intake, are highly polluted. They also say that less expensive alternatives, such as the less polluted Damour River that is also closer to Beirut, were not considered by the government and the World Bank. As of December 2013, less than 1 percent of the loan has been disbursed and no civil works contract has been awarded.|$|R

40|$|Interface {{roughness}} {{effects on}} electron <b>transmission</b> in <b>tunnel</b> junctions are investigated theoretically in {{the limit of}} thick barriers. The barrier roughness is described in terms of self-affine fractal scaling by the roughness exponent H, rms roughness amplitude w, and correlation length ξ. For realistic parameters diffuse transmission usually exceeds specular transmission. It is shown that for small roughness exponents (H< 0. 5) the transmission coefficient increases with decreasing ratio w/ξ. For large roughness exponents (or smoother interfaces at short wavelengths) the transmission coefficient has a maximum at a certain value of the ratio w/ξ. With increasing w/ξ the tunneling current behaves similarly as the transmission coefficient. ...|$|R

The centre console, dashboard, steering wheel, door cards and <b>transmission</b> <b>tunnel</b> were carried over unchanged. However, Proton did introduce several minor additions and cosmetic changes, the most prominent of which being the dual-tone colour scheme, a contrast from the all-black interior of the Iriz. The lower-half of the dashboard, <b>transmission</b> <b>tunnel,</b> handbrake, cup holders, pillars and inner sections of the door cards are finished in a light grey or beige colour, while the top-half of the dashboard and outer frame of the door cards are in matte black. The new colour scheme is said to increase the impression of space and perceived quality, while also paying homage to the old CM Persona. There are ten storage compartments and seven cup holders in the BH Persona.|$|E
