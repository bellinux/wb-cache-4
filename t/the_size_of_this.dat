5|$|Although {{the exact}} {{size of the}} two outer CO shells remains elusive, {{preliminary}} estimates suggest that one shell extends from about 1.5 to 4.0 arcseconds and the other expands as far as 7.0 arcseconds. Assuming the Jovian orbit of 5.5AU as the star radius, the inner shell would extend roughly 50 to 150 stellar radii (~300 to 800AU) with the outer one as far as 250 stellar radii (~1400AU). The Sun's heliopause is estimated at about 100 AU, so <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> outer shell would be almost fourteen {{times the size of}} the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The {{resonator}} {{shown in}} figure 12 is around 120 μm in length. Experimental complete filters with an operating frequency of 30GHz have been produced using cantilever varactors as the resonator elements. <b>The</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> filter is around 4×3.5mm. Cantilever resonators are typically applied at frequencies below 200MHz, but other structures, such as micro-machined cavities, {{can be used in}} the microwave bands. Extremely high Q resonators can be made with this technology; flexural mode resonators with a Q in excess of 80,000 at 8MHz are reported.|$|E

25|$|Diet has {{an effect}} on blood {{cholesterol}}, but <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> effect varies between individuals. Moreover, when dietary cholesterol intake goes down, production (principally by the liver) typically increases, so that blood cholesterol changes can be modest or even elevated. This compensatory response may explain hypercholesterolemia in anorexia. A 2016 review found tentative evidence that dietary cholesterol is associated with higher blood cholesterol. Trans fats have been shown to reduce levels of HDL while increasing levels of LDL. LDL and total cholesterol also increases by very high fructose intake.|$|E
25|$|These {{methods of}} {{retaining}} wall construction employ bored piling techniques, normally CFA or rotary. They provide special advantages where available working space dictates that basement excavation faces be vertical. Both methods offer technically effective and cost efficient temporary or permanent means of retaining {{the sides of}} bulk excavations even in water bearing strata. When used in permanent works, these walls can be designed to accommodate vertical loads in addition to moments and horizontal forces. Construction of both methods {{is the same as}} for foundation bearing piles. Contiguous walls are constructed with small gaps between adjacent piles. <b>The</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> space is determined {{by the nature of the}} soils.|$|E
25|$|The {{impeller}} (compressor) and {{compressor casing}} of the 1937 Power Jets WU jet engine {{was made from}} RR.56 and RR.55 respectively. In the subsequent Power Jets W.1 the compressor material was changed to RR.59. By 1943 the de Havilland Goblin, the first British production jet engine {{to be built in}} large numbers, was in development. The centrifugal compressor for this began as a 500lb 'cheese' of RR.50, the largest forging made of it. After machining, these were reduced to 109lbs. <b>The</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> forging was so great that cooling rates in its centre affected the metallurgical properties of the alloy; Devereux advised the reduction of the silicon content to below 0.25% and this low silicon RR.50 alloy was used throughout Goblin production.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. By the {{theoretical}} mechanics and mechanical principle simplifying {{the part of}} mechanical motion of the machine of rehabilitation for slider-crank mechanism, it can be inferred to obtain the calculation formula about rehabilitation exercise. The derivation {{is based on the}} motion trails, velocity and acceleration. According to the requirements <b>of</b> <b>this</b> machine, the analysis of the motion can be gained with MATLAB. So <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> each bar on the system of motion will be got based on the comparing analysis results. Moreover <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> machine <b>of</b> rehabilitation can be determined.

30|$|Although a {{statistically}} significant difference among language learners’ knowledge of formulaic sequences on different tests (pre-test, post-test, and follow-up test) was found, <b>the</b> effect <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> result also needs to be considered to be able to determine <b>the</b> exact <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> difference. In this regard, the value of interest is partial eta squared. The value of partial eta squared obtained for Test in this study is 0.98. Using the commonly used guidelines proposed by Cohen (1988), this result suggests a very large effect size. Expressed as a percentage, 98 % of variance in the change in language learners’ knowledge of formulaic sequences is explained by the treatment they received between the three tests.|$|R
25|$|The English rule in Aquitaine was by {{then under}} threat. Since 1370 {{large parts of}} the region had fallen under French rule and in 1372 Bertrand du Guesclin lay siege at La Rochelle. To respond {{to the demands of the}} Franco-Castilian {{alliance}} of 1368, the king of Castile, Henry II of Trastámara, dispatched a fleet to Aquitaine under Ambrosio Boccanegra, who was seconded by Cabeza de Vaca, Fernando de Peón and Rui Díaz de Rojas. <b>The</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> fleet is also uncertain. According to López de Ayala, it was composed of 12 galleys. Froissart, in his first relation, mentioned 40 sailing ships and 13 barges, but later reduced this numbers to 13 galleys. Quatre Premiers Valois and Chronique des Pays-Bas mention respectively 20 and 22 galleys.|$|E
25|$|When light {{traveling}} in an optically dense medium hits a boundary at a steep angle (larger than the critical angle for the boundary), {{the light is}} completely reflected. This is called total internal reflection. This effect is used in optical fibers to confine light in the core. Light travels through the fiber core, bouncing back and forth off {{the boundary between the}} core and cladding. Because the light must strike the boundary with an angle greater than the critical angle, only light that enters the fiber within a certain range of angles can travel down the fiber without leaking out. This range of angles is called the acceptance cone of the fiber. <b>The</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> acceptance cone {{is a function of the}} refractive index difference between the fiber's core and cladding.|$|E
25|$|According to the Herbarium of Western Australia’s records, {{there are}} 3,314 {{flowering}} plant species from 119 different families and over 4,200 different taxa (which includes undescribed species, subspecies, hybrids and varieties) recorded so far for the Great Western Woodlands. It {{is estimated that}} almost half of these species are endemic to the south west of Australia. This floristic diversity can be attributed {{in part to the}} wide range of habitats throughout the region, from heavy soil valley floors, to sandplain, salt lakes, granite hills, banded ironstone hills, greenstone belt mosaics and many others. Each of these environments provides the conditions for unique types of flora. The amount of plant diversity in the Great Western Woodlands is comparable to the plant diversity in Canada, a country more than 60 times <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> region.|$|E

25|$|Like {{others before}} and after him, he also noticed that the Moon has a {{noticeable}} parallax, i.e., that it appears displaced from its calculated position (compared to the Sun or stars), and the difference is greater when closer to the horizon. He knew that this is because in the then-current models the Moon circles {{the center of the}} Earth, but the observer is at the surface—the Moon, Earth and observer form a triangle with a sharp angle that changes all the time. From <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> parallax, the distance of the Moon as measured in Earth radii can be determined. For the Sun however, there was no observable parallax (we now know that it is about 8.8", several times smaller than the resolution of the unaided eye).|$|E
25|$|By far {{the most}} common object was a stone star with a hole through the middle. They were found {{everywhere}} between Ibarra and Riobamba. The majority have six rays (and none have more), proceeding symmetrically from the center, and the whole are fashioned alike upon each side. A certain number have only five rays, and occasional examples are irregular in shape. All are pierced by a hole, which has been drilled from the two sides, and <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> varies considerably. In dimensions they range from three to five inches in diameter and from three-quarters of an inch to two inches in thickness. Their weight is from five to twenty ounces. The larger part are made from basaltic rock and gabbro. Objects of this class were also cast in metal but these are now rarely found in Ecuador.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{keywords}} attribute, {{the description}} attribute {{is supported by}} most major search engines, like Yahoo! and Bing, while Google will fall back on this tag when information about the page itself is requested (e.g. using the related: query). The description attribute provides a concise explanation of a Web page's content. This allows the Web page authors to give a more meaningful description for listings than might be displayed if the search engine was unable to automatically create its own description based on the page content. The description is often, but not always, displayed on search engine results pages, so it can affect click-through rates. While clicks for a result can be a positive sign of effective title and description writing, Google does not recognize this meta element as a ranking factor, so using target keyword phrases in that element will not help a site rank better.

25|$|An early {{application}} of a DNA database was the compilation of a Mitochondrial DNA Concordance, prepared by Kevin W. P. Miller and John L. Dawson at the University of Cambridge from 1996 to 1998 from data collected as part of Miller's PhD thesis. There are now several DNA databases in existence around the world. Some are private, {{but most of the}} largest databases are government-controlled. The United States maintains the largest DNA database, with the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) holding over 9 million records as of 2011. The United Kingdom maintains the National DNA Database (NDNAD), which is of similar size, despite the UK's smaller population. <b>The</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> database, and its rate of growth, are giving concern to civil liberties groups in the UK, where police have wide-ranging powers to take samples and retain them even in the event of acquittal. The Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition partially addressed these concerns with part 1 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, under which DNA samples must be deleted if suspects are acquitted or not charged, except in relation to certain (mostly serious and/or sexual) offences.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{explosion}} of descriptions {{has more than}} doubled <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> genus, however, the history of these discoveries starts much earlier. In 1954, one of the associates of Círculo Paulista de Orquidófilos, an orchid society in São Paulo, presented a lecture where he talked informally about the innumerable varieties of Leptotes that he had collected throughout the years. This lecture was printed and distributed in the bulletin of the association.: Monografia do gênero Leptotes in Revista do Círculo Paulista de Orquidófilos Vol.11, pp. 53-63 e 64-72. São Paulo, 1954. In 2004, Eric Christenson identified {{at least two of the}} several varieties mentioned in the lecture to be existing in collections throughout the United States and decided to describe them formally as independent species. One of these plants, Leptotes harryphillipsii, is very similar to L. pauloensis already a problematic species by itself.: Leptotes harryphillipsii in Orchids South Africa Vol.35, pp. 53. Cape Town, 2004. The other one, L. mogyensis, is unknown to Brazilian scholars and collectors.
