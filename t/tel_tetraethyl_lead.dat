While use of <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>lead</b> is limited, the addition of special leaded fuels that increase the octane number is a requirement for many fuels. In this connection, {{the extent to which the}} action of <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>lead</b> through the addition of knock-resistant hydrocarbons to the base gasoline is influenced, is quite important. To the elucidation of this problem and of the storage stability of leaded fuels, the present report is dedicated...|$|R

40|$|Accidental human {{exposure}} to {{a high level of}} tetramethyl lead is described. Tetramethyl lead is blended with petrol as an antiknock agent, and it has similar physical properties to <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>lead.</b> The patient had high levels of lead in urine, averaging 4 - 75 mumol (983 mug) daily for the first four days after exposure and he continued to have raised levels of urinary lead for six months. He had no symptoms or physical signs of lead poisoning and comparisons are made between this case and previously reported cases of poisoning by <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>lead.</b> In the cases of <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>lead</b> poisoning all the patients had symptoms, some severe, yet in no instance did the urinary lead levels approach those described in this patient. The effects of chelation therapy with calcium disodium versenate are discussed and the results are similar to those found in <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>lead</b> poisoning. Blood lead levels of up to 3 - 91 mumol/l (81 mug/ 100 g) occurred but these levels were not raised commensurate with the urinary lead output. The levels of deltaaminolaevulinic acid (ALA) in the urine were not significantly raised and this report shows that the urinary lead levels give a better guide to the degree of absorption of tetramethyl lead compared with the blood lead or urinary ALA levels. The report illustrates that tetramethyl lead is less toxic to man than <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>lead...</b>|$|R

40|$|Desorption {{kinetics}} of <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>lead,</b> under changing pH {{and controlled}} temperature, Eh and dissolved oxygen, in a mining-impacted Mexican tropical river, was examined using samples {{placed in a}} closed system. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the potential environmental risk for local residents from the <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>lead</b> present in the water column. Statistical and geochemical methods elucidated the potential envi-ronmental threat of free <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>lead</b> (<b>TEL).</b> Specifically, analysis of water samples from three stations in the Taxco River basin indicated that altering pH caused signifi-cant changes in the concentration of TEL in the water column. Since this study was performed on a closed controlled system that contained sediments and water from the river, desorption from sediments caused by changing pH is the mechanism by which TEL increases in the river water. Since the samples used for this study are natural samples collected in the river, it is assumed that this behavior could be expected in the river if a suddenly decrease in pH occurs. It is probable that the processes of TEL desorption depend on several variables, since fitted curves, for changes in TEL release with time...|$|R

Before making the subject tests, it was supposed that the effect of adding <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>lead</b> would be to change the length of the delay period, at a given fuel-air ratio and compression ratio. These tests showed for compression ratios between 8. 0 and 14. 9 that varying the cmcentration of <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>lead</b> in isooctane has a very mall effect on the deley at fuel+ ratios between O.

Oxygenates also help gasoline burn more completely, reducing tailpipe emissions from pre-1984 motor vehicles; dilute or displace gasoline components such as aromatics (e.g., benzene) and sulfur; and optimize oxidation during combustion.
