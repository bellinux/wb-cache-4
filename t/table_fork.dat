By the 11th century, the <b>table</b> <b>fork</b> had become increasingly prevalent in the Italian peninsula. It gained a following in Italy before any other European region because of historical ties with Byzantium, and continued to gain popularity due to the increasing presence of pasta in the Italian diet. At first, pasta was consumed using a long wooden spike, but this eventually evolved into three spikes, a design better suited to gathering the noodles. In Italy, it became commonplace by the 14th century and was almost universally used by the merchant and upper classes by 1600. It was proper for a guest to arrive with his own fork and spoon enclosed in a box called a cadena; this usage {{was introduced to the}} French court with Catherine de' Medici's entourage.In Portugal, forks were first used at the time of Infanta Beatrice, Duchess of Viseu, King Manuel I of Portugal's mother around 1450. However, forks were not commonly used in Southern Europe until the 16th century when they became part of Italian etiquette. The utensil had also gained some currency in Spain by this time, Its use gradually spread to France. Nevertheless, most of Europe did not adopt use of the fork until the 18th century.|$|E

Shay gets eliminated when asked [...] "Which fork do you use to eat frog legs?", saying the <b>table</b> <b>fork.</b> MoNique then {{says it was a}} trick question and the answer was fingers. The three remaining girls are then given one hour to write a speech explaining what it would mean to them to win the money and to explain what they learned. MoNique acknowledged that Shay had been ganged-up on and convinced to come back and judge the ladies on their speeches to show that you can play a person one time, but have to need the person another time. Leilene and Becky both read their speeches on paper, but Saaphyri comes out and says that she does not have anything, and begins to speak [...] "off the top of her head". Leilene talks about using the money towards a better future for her and her kids. Becky says if she wins the money that she would repay Saaphyris kindness back by giving her $25,000, half the money prize. During Saaphyris speech, she says that the money would be used for her to have a place that she could call home, leaving MoNique and Shay in tears. Saaphyri and Shay reconcile and forgive each other and MoNique then tells Shay she must choose the final two. Shay first picks Saaphyri because her speech was from the heart and it moved her the most. However, Shay could not bring herself to choose between Becky and Leilene. Because of this, MoNique believes that Shay is now a grown woman, and makes the decision for her. MoNique chooses Leilene as the second finalist and eliminates Becky because she felt that she did not need the money as much as Leilene or Saaphyri did. MoNique tells the two remaining ladies that tomorrow they should get ready to have a make-over. During the final elimination ceremony Leilene was told she did not win but was given the opportunity to go into modeling thanks in part by Dean Keith. Saaphyri is crowned Charm School Queen and breaks down into tears, thanking God that he helped her.

6000|$|Mr. Lincoln's Inaugural Speech was of {{the kind}} usually called [...] "firm, but conciliatory,"--a policy {{doubtful}} in troublous times, since it commonly argues weakness, and more than doubtful in a crisis like ours, since it left the course which the Administration meant to take ambiguous, and, while it weakened the Government by exciting the distrust of all who wished for vigorous measures, really strengthened the enemy by encouraging the conspirators in the Border States. There might be a {{question as to whether}} this or that attitude were expedient for the Republican party; there could be none as to the only safe and dignified one for the Government of the Nation. Treason was as much treason in the beginning of March as in the middle of April; and it seems certain now, as it seemed probable to many then, that the country would have sooner rallied to the support of the Government, if the Government had shown an earlier confidence in the loyalty of the people. Though the President talked of [...] "repossessing" [...] the stolen forts, arsenals, and custom-houses, yet close upon this declaration followed the disheartening intelligence that the cabinet were discussing the propriety of evacuating not only Fort Sumter, which was of no strategic importance, but Fort Pickens, which was the key to the Gulf of Mexico, and to abandon which was almost to acknowledge the independence of the Rebel States. Thus far the Free States had waited with commendable patience for some symptom of vitality in the new Administration, something that should distinguish it from the piteous helplessness of its predecessor. But now their pride was too deeply outraged for endurance; indignant remonstrances were heard from all quarters, and the Government seemed for the first time fairly to comprehend that it had twenty millions of freemen at its back, and that forts might be taken and held by honest men as well as by knaves and traitors. The nettle had been stroked long enough; it was time to try a firm grip. Still the Administration seemed inclined to temporize, so thoroughly was it possessed by the notion of conciliating the Border States. In point of fact, the side which those States might take in the struggle between Law and Anarchy was of vastly more import to them than to us. They could bring no considerable reinforcement of money, credit, or arms to the rebels; they could at best but add so many mouths to an army whose commissariat was already dangerously embarrassed. They could not even, except temporarily, keep the war away from the territory of the seceding States, every one of which had a sea-door open to the invasion of an enemy who controlled the entire navy and shipping of the country. The position assumed by Eastern Virginia and Maryland was of consequence only so far as it might facilitate a sudden raid on Washington, and the policy of both these States was to amuse the Government by imaginary negotiations till the plans of the conspirators were ripe. In both States men were actively recruited and enrolled to assist in attacking the capital. With them, as with the more openly rebellious States, the new theory of [...] "Coercion" [...] was ingeniously arranged like a valve, yielding at the slightest impulse to the passage of forces for the subversion of legitimate authority, closing imperviously, so that no drop of power could ooze through in the opposite direction. Lord De Roos, long suspected of cheating at cards, would never have been convicted but for the resolution of an adversary, who, pinning his hand to the <b>table</b> with a <b>fork,</b> said to him blandly, [...] "My Lord, if the ace of spades is not under your Lordship's hand, why, then, I beg your pardon!" [...] It seems to us that a timely treatment of Governor Letcher in the same energetic way would have saved the disasters of Harper's Ferry and Norfolk,--for disasters they were, though six months of temporizing had so lowered the public sense of what was due to the national dignity that people were glad to see the Government active at length, even if only in setting fire to its own house.|$|R
