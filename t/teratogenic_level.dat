40|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} neurological disorders. In these circumstances, more than 25 % of the patients are women of reproductive age. The aim of our research was to analyze the effective-ness and safety of antiepileptic therapy in women with epilepsy during pregnancy and to analyze the pregnancies ’ outcomes. We included in our research 121 pregnancies of 101 women aged at the moment of childbearing about 26. 9 ± 4. 57 years old. Idiopathic forms of epilepsy were predo-minant among all causes— 47. 1 % (р < 0. 01). Of all cases, 65. 4 % remained seizure-free from gene-ralized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), including 69. 6 % of all idiopathic epilepsy cases and 68. 6 % among symptomatic ones. The antiepileptic drugs (AED) dosages were exceeding <b>teratogenic</b> <b>level</b> at the moment of conception in 54. 7 % of the cases. Worse control of epileptic seizures was asso-ciated with Benzobarbital (66. 7 %) and Lamotrigine (50. 0 %). Women with epilepsy did not re-ceive specialized neurological therapy before conception in most cases, which leaded to the usag...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEight {{distinct}} inherited disorders {{have been}} linked to different enzyme defects in the isoprenoid/cholesterol biosynthetic pathway following the finding of abnormally increased levels of intermediate metabolites in patients and confirmed by the demonstration of disease-causing mutations in genes encoding the implicated enzymes. Patients afflicted with these disorders are characterized by multiple morphogenic and congenital anomalies including internal organ, skeletal and/or skin abnormalities underlining an important role for cholesterol in human embryogenesis and development. The etiology of the underlying pathophysiology may involve multiple affected processes due to lowered cholesterol and/or the elevated, <b>teratogenic</b> <b>levels</b> of the intermediate sterol precursors...|$|R
40|$|Sodium arsenate induces {{developmental}} malformations in {{a variety}} of experimental animals. In the golden hamster, the intravenous (or intraperitoneal) administration of 20 mg/kg of sodium arsenate during day 8 to 9 of gestation induces a rather specific spectrum of congenital malformations. This period corresponds to the period of very rapid differentiation and major organogenesis in this animal. The spectrum of defects produced by arsenate in the hamster includes exencephaly, encephaloceles, skeletal defects, and malformations of the genito-urinary system. This teratogenic effect can be significantly reduced by the simultaneous administration of selenium. Recent studies in this laboratory have demonstrated the permeability of the placenta to 74 As during the early critical stages of embryogenesis and the distribution of this isotope in maternal, placental and embryonic tissues. We have also recently demonstrated the marked potentiation of the teratogenic effect of sodium arsenate by subjecting the mothers to short periods of hyperthermia immediately following the administration of subteratogenic or minimal <b>teratogenic</b> <b>levels</b> of arsenate...|$|R
40|$|Because {{of reports}} of the {{potential}} risk of maternal hyperthermia to a developing embryo or fetus, studies were done to determine {{the length of time}} a woman must stay in a hot tub or sauna before her temperature reaches 38. 9 °C. The vaginal temperatures of 20 nonpregnant women of childbearing age were recorded while they sat in hot tubs set at 39. 0 °C or 41. 1 °C and in a sauna with an average temperature of 81. 4 °C. Five women were able to remain in the 39. 0 °C tub and six in the 41. 1 °C tub until their temperature reached 38. 9 °C, but in none did their temperature reach that level before 15 minutes in the 39. 0 °C tub or 10 minutes in the 41. 1 °C tub. The remainder left in discomfort while their body temperatures were lower. This indicates that the usual use of hot tubs is unlikely to raise a woman's body temperature to potentially <b>teratogenic</b> <b>levels,</b> although prolonged use may. None of the women were able to remain in the sauna long enough for their temperature to reach 39. 9 °C...|$|R
40|$|The {{homozygous}} {{disruption of}} the mouse AP- 2 gene yields a complex and lethal phenotype that results from defective development of the neural tube, head, and body wall. The severe and pleiotropic developmental abnormalities observed in the knockout mouse suggested that AP- 2 may regulate several morphogenic pathways. To uncouple the individual developmental mechanisms that are dependent on AP- 2, we have now analyzed chimeric mice composed of both wild-type and AP- 2 -null cells. The phenotypes obtained from these chimeras indicate {{that there is an}} independent requirement for AP- 2 {{in the formation of the}} neural tube, body wall, and craniofacial skeleton. In addition, these studies reveal that AP- 2 exerts a major influence on eye formation, which is a critical new role for AP- 2 that was masked previously in the knockout mice. Furthermore, we also have uncovered an unexpected influence of AP- 2 on limb pattern formation; this influence is typified by major limb duplications. The range of phenotypes observed in the chimeras displays a significant overlap with those caused by <b>teratogenic</b> <b>levels</b> of retinoic acid, strongly suggesting that AP- 2 is an important component of the mechanism of action of this morphogen...|$|R
40|$|Acitretin has {{recently}} been introduced to replace etretinate {{in the treatment of}} severe psoriasis due to a considerable shorter terminal half-life. The previously recommended 2 -month anticonceptive period after acitretin treatment has been extended to 2 years after the detection of etretinate in certain acitretin recipients. In the present study, 10 patients with severe psoriasis were treated with 30 mg acitretin daily for 3 months. Seven patients had detectable mean steady- state plasma etretinate concentrations in the range of 2. 5 to 56. 7 ng/ml. Four of the patients showed <b>teratogenic</b> <b>levels</b> of plasma etretinate. Consumption of alcohol appeared to be an important contributing factor for the formation of etretinate. As judged from the dose- and body-weight-normalized AUC values (AUCcor) there was a great inter-individual variation (sixfold) in the systemic availability of acitretin. After discontinuation of therapy, the rate of elimination of both acitretin (t 1 / 2 range 1. 0 to 25. 4 d) and 13 -cis-acitretin (t 1 / 2 range 1. 5 to 25. 7 d) was found {{to be related to the}} observed mean steady-state level of etretinate as evidenced by a longer terminal t 1 / 2 of patients with high levels of etretinate in plasma. A mean terminal elimination half-life of etretinate was found to be 45. 7 d ± 10. 6 (mean ± SD; range 27. 0 to 59. 3 d). The risk of metabolic formation of etretinate in acitretin recipients makes it impossible to draw any definite conclusion with regard to recommendation of length of anticonceptive period following acitretin therapy in psoriatics. Monitoring of plasma etretinate levels in acitretin-treated fertile women is advisable...|$|R
