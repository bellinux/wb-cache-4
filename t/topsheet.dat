2500|$|Snowboards are {{generally}} constructed of a hardwood core which is sandwiched between {{multiple layers of}} fibreglass. Some snowboards incorporate the use of more exotic materials such as carbon fiber, Kevlar, aluminium (as a honeycomb core structure), and have incorporated piezo dampers. The front (or [...] "nose") of the board is upturned to help the board glide over uneven snow. The back (or [...] "tail") of the board is also upturned to enable backwards (or [...] "switch") riding. The base (the side of the board which contacts the ground) is made of Polyethylene plastic. [...] The two major types of base construction are extruded and sintered. [...] An extruded base is a basic, low-maintenance design which basically consists of the plastic base material melted into its form. [...] A sintered base uses the same material as an extruded base, but first grinds the material into a powder, then, using heat and pressure, molds the material into its desired form. [...] A sintered base is generally softer than its extruded counterpart, but has a porous structure which enables it to absorb wax. [...] This wax absorption (along with a properly done 'hot wax'), greatly reduces surface friction between the base and the snow, allowing the snowboard to travel on {{a thin layer of}} water. Snowboards with sintered bases are much faster, but require semi-regular maintenance and are easier to damage. The bottom edges of the snowboard are fitted with a thin strip of steel, just a couple of millimeters wide. [...] This steel edge allows the board to grab or 'dig into' hard snow and ice (like the blade of an ice skate), and also protects the boards internal structure. [...] The top of the board is typically a layer of acrylic with some form of graphic designed to attract attention, showcase artwork, or serve the purpose similar to that of any other form of printed media. Flite Snowboards, an early designer, pressed the first closed-molded boards from a garage in Newport, Rhode Island, in the mid-1980s. Snowboard <b>topsheet</b> graphics can be a highly personal statement and many riders spend many hours customizing the look of their boards. The top of some boards may even include thin inlays with other materials, and some are made entirely of epoxy-impregnated wood. [...] The base of the board may also feature graphics, often designed in a manner to make the board's manufacturer recognizable in photos.|$|E
5000|$|The theory behind speed glue {{is that it}} is {{soaked up}} by the sponge layer between the rubber <b>topsheet</b> and blade of a table tennis paddle. The sponge begins to expand, and {{consequently}} begins to stretch the attached rubber <b>topsheet</b> causing increased tension and creating a [...] "trampoline" [...] effect on the ball causing it to bounce back quicker.|$|E

50|$|In 2008, {{a number}} of {{complaints}} arose when Burton produced snowboards, some with <b>topsheets</b> illustrating self-mutilation and others with <b>topsheets</b> illustrating Playboy bunnies. As a result, the Burton Love was discontinued for the 2012 line and replaced by the Mr. Nice Guy.|$|R
5000|$|Lib Tech {{is known}} {{throughout}} the snowboard industry for their longtime commitment to environmental sustainability. [...] Mike Olson {{took the first}} steps towards sustainability early {{in the history of}} Lib Technologies; he replaced toxic ABS plastic with recyclable polyethylene in 1986, and introduced sustainable polymer <b>topsheets</b> and bamboo cores in 1995.|$|R
5000|$|Niche Snowboards, based out of Salt Lake City Utah {{is another}} {{snowboard}} manufacturer {{that has really}} been revolutionizing the industry. Founded {{with a focus on}} the relationships between materials, our environment, and ourselves, the company has an incredible line-up of ecologically-minded boards. Their technology includes: recycled materials, sustainably harvested wood cores, [...] "hemphop stringers" [...] (a carbon fiber substitute), Magma Fiber (a fiberglass substitute made from Basalt), Bio-resins (replacing petroleum-based alternatives), and bamboo <b>topsheets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Salomon {{released}} {{their first}} snowboard in 1997 {{after several years}} of development. The first board featured a simple single-color <b>topsheet</b> graphic and advanced technologies adopted from the resources of the ski experts. The company built a strong team of pro riders including Daniel Frank and Michelle Taggert.|$|E
50|$|The Head Standard was Howard Head's first {{successful}} ski design, and arguably {{the first modern}} downhill ski. The Standard used composite construction, with a plywood core sandwiched between aluminum outer skins, steel edges tapering into the core, and a hard plastic base, sidewalls and <b>topsheet.</b> The only major change in ski design since the Standard {{is the use of}} a fibreglass torsion box in place of the aluminum layers.|$|E
50|$|The {{new design}} was {{introduced}} in the winter of 1950-51. Head shipped pairs of skis on consignment all across the US, and took to the hills himself, selling them {{out of the back of}} his station wagon. By the end of the year, 300 pairs of the $85 skis were sold. One last problem needed to be solved; the mirror-like <b>topsheet</b> was distracting in the sun, so a thin sheet of black plastic was added to the top. The result was the Head Standard, which would remain largely unchanged for over a decade.|$|E
50|$|Backcountry {{freestyle}} skier Eric Pollard {{first met}} with Jason Levinthal in 1998. Sharing a common vision {{on the potential}} of freestyle skiing and the technology adaptations required, the two began a partnership that now includes over 10 ski pro models, the majority geared toward backcountry freestyle. Pollard is also artistically involved with Line, creating his own ski <b>topsheets</b> or graphics, and has contributed in Line’s outerwear design. Levinthal has since left Line Skis to begin his own company, J Skis.|$|R
5000|$|Currently, Lib Tech {{even has}} its own {{environmental}} task force, dubbed the “environMENTAL division,” which oversees the company’s sustainability measures. [...] Not only does Lib Tech incorporate environmentally friendly materials into their snowboards (such as water-based graphics, non petroleum-based bio-plastic <b>topsheets,</b> Volatile organic compound resin, renewable wood cores, and basalt fiber rather than fiberglass), but the company has also designed their factory with the environment (and the health of their employees) in mind. The factory’s heating system runs on canola-based bio-diesel, which Lib-Tech makes available to employees and local farmers through a bio-diesel co-op program. [...] Wood sawdust is recycled as a soil additive, scrap wood is repackaged as kindling, and scrap plastics are reground and reused. [...] Water-cleansed grinding systems reduce airborne particulate levels, and the factory’s air supply is constantly fresh due to a 2700% air-replacement ventilation system.|$|R
5000|$|However, it {{was during}} this period that the {{fibreglass}} torsion box design started to become popular, and improved rapidly. Head hated the concept and refused to consider studying it, claiming [...] "Fiberglass is a flash in the pan. It will be gone tomorrow." [...] But this attitude changed when Jean-Claude Killy continued winning races on the Dynamic VR-17, one of the first successful [...] "torsion box" [...] racing skis. Head responded by hiring Killy and his ski technician to help them tune a new fibreglass design of their own. The resulting Killy 800 almost killed the company when the plastic used on the new bright-red <b>topsheet</b> started cracking in dry climates. Worse, tuned by Killy the ski turned out to be far too stiff for the intermediate skier it was sold to. The product was improved and became the basis for Head ski designs in the 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{producers}} are generally reluctant {{to reveal the}} exact composition of their products, the main materials will usually be bleached rayon (cellulose made from wood pulp), cotton and plastics. In addition, fragrance and antibacterial agents can be included. The plastic parts are the backsheet and polymer powder as an additional powerful absorbent (superabsorbent polymers) that turns into a gel when moistened. [...] Procter & Gamble are advertising a proprietary material called infinicel as the core of their napkins.In general, the layering is as follows: [...] "an absorbent core material placed between a flexible liquid-pervious <b>topsheet</b> and a liquid-impervious plastic backsheet that has an adhesive on the outside for attaching the napkin to an undergarment". As {{is the case with}} disposable tampons and diapers recycling is difficult and rarely done due to cost reasons although proof-of-principle solution appear to exist. When not dumped in a landfill where the non-biodegradable parts may persist for thousands of years, conventional hygiene products can at best be [...] "thermally recycled" [...] (incinerated). Environmentally more friendly solutions can be found in 100% cotton pads.|$|E
5000|$|These early diapers were bulky, heavy {{products}} {{composed of}} fluff pulp with a rayon <b>topsheet,</b> polyethylene backsheet. In 1966, Pampers launched a 'wingfold' design and by 1969 started a [...] "third size". By this time, Pampers {{had become a}} national brand in the United States. Procter and Gamble replaced the pin-on design with tapes in 1971. Toddler and Premature Infant sizes were also introduced. In 1973, P&G developed elasticized single and double gussets around the leg and waist areas to aid in fitting and in containing urine or stool which had not been absorbed. In fact, the first patent {{for the use of}} double gussets in a diaper was in 1973 by P&G. In 1982, Pampers introduced an elasticized wingfold diaper with elastic leg gathers and refastenable tapes which was a cross between the early 1960s design and the modern hourglass shape, a feature that was first introduced on Luvs in 1976 and evolved into an industry standard in 1985. [...] In 1986, thin diapers made with absorbent gelling material were released. This made the average weight of a typical medium size diaper decrease by 50%. [...] In 1987, Pampers and Huggies both introduced frontal tape systems which allow repositioning of the lateral tape without tearing the diaper. In the 1990s Pampers introduced a thinner diaper known as Ultra Dry Thins.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSanitary pads for {{menstrual hygiene}} have a layered design {{consisting}} of a fluid permeable surface (<b>topsheet),</b> an absorbent core, and an impermeable backing with adhesive. Most sanitary pads employ cellulose-based cores. This describes the safety evaluation of a menstrual pad with an emollient-treated <b>topsheet</b> and a novel polymeric foam core. A quantitative risk assessment was performed, which included: (1) toxicological evaluation of the raw material components; (2) quantitative exposure assessments of pad constituents, accounting for the fluid handling properties of the product and pertinent conditions of use; and (3) risk characterization for exposure to raw materials (e. g., potential for skin irritation, contact sensitization, or systemic effects, if relevant) and to the physical article itself (potential effects on skin friction, etc.). No significant risk of adverse effects was found. Five years of post-market surveillance substantiates that the product is well-tolerated (1 health complaint reported per 2 million products shipped to market) and surpasses women's expectations for menstrual protection and overall comfort and dryness. This report illustrates how the classical risk assessment paradigm, informed by the impact of product design, functionality and pertinent use conditions, allowed the systematic safety evaluation of a personal hygiene product with a novel, non-cellulosic absorbent foam core technology...|$|E
40|$|AbstractModern {{disposable}} diapers {{are complex}} products and ubiquitous globally. A robust safety assessment for disposable diapers include two important exposure parameters, i) frequency of diaper use & ii) constituent transfer from diaper to skin from {{direct and indirect}} skin contact materials. This article uses published information and original studies to quantify the exposure parameters for diapers. Using growth tables {{for the first three}} years of diapered life, an average body weight of 10 – 11  kg can be calculated, with a 10 th percentile for females (8. 5 – 8. 8  kg). Data from surveys and diary studies were conducted to determine the frequency of use of diapers. The overall mean in the US is 4. 7 diapers per day with a 75 th, 90 th, and 95 th percentile of 5. 0, 6. 0, and 7. 0 respectively. Using diaper topsheet-lotion transfer as a model, direct transfer to skin from the <b>topsheet</b> was 3. 0 – 4. 3 % of the starting amount of lotion. Indirect transfer of diaper core materials as a measure of re-wetting of the skin via urine resurfacing back to the <b>topsheet</b> under pressure was estimated at a range of 0. 32 – 0. 66 % averaging 0. 46 %. As described, a thorough data-based understanding of exposure is critical for a robust exposure based safety assessment of disposable diapers...|$|E
40|$|A {{new model}} to {{calculate}} the key snowboard properties of bending and torsional stiffness has been developed. The code allows any composite sandwich structure to be evaluated for use within a snowboard, including consideration of fabric architecture on a micro level. A geometric unit-cell approach was utilised to predict the overall fibre volume fraction, average tow undulation and areal weight for ten common fabric configurations. Elastic properties of the composite layers are calculated using Hashin&# 039;s Cylinder Model, together with common coordinate transformations and volumetric averaging methods for the stiffness and compliance constants. The classical 2 -D laminate theory was applied {{to calculate the}} key stiffness properties along the chord for the full snowboard composite sandwich, including consideration of the <b>topsheet</b> and base layer. A simple validation of the model was undertaken to confirm its applicability to modern snowboard design...|$|E
40|$|Surface water runoff is a {{function}} of many interrelated factors that include, climate, soils, land use and the physiography of watersheds. Quantifying watershed basin characteristics would make possible to relate many of these factors to surface water runoff, leading to an improved understanding of drainage basin characteristics on surface water runoff. The quantification of watershed basin drainage characteristics is tedious and much time consuming if done manually. The use of Geographic Information System (GIS) for processing the digital data of the basin makes easier the characterization and analyses of more number of watersheds. Morphometric parameters, Basin geometrical parameters and relief parameters of Keralapura watersheds of Cauvery basin, Karnataka have been taken for the present work. This twin watersheds lies between Latitude 12 ° 15 ' 00 " N and 12 ° 45 ' 00 " N and Longitude 76 ° 05 ' 00 " E and 76 ° 15 ' 00 " E. Morphometric analysis provides the characteristics of watershed, which is required for better understanding and prioritization of the watersheds for development and management of water resources and landuse planning. Automatic drainage labelling morphometric analysis and characterization of watershed from existing database of Keralapura watersheds of Cauvery basin, Karnataka, India was carried out using the GIS software NRIS Geolawns in Arcinfo, Drainage network was extracted from 1 : 5000 <b>topsheet</b> by manual digitizing in Auto CAD and selection was done for the two watersheds separately. Elevation contours were also digitized from 1 : 5000 <b>topsheet.</b> Geo-morphometric analysis was done by giving the pour points in the Audrala module, Morphometric analysis - stream parameters and basin parameters using the STMPARA and BASEGEO module and the relief parameters appended to thit were used for complete analysis of the water sheds. The results were generated using the Geomorsis - Rort generating module. The results were used for the characterization of the watershed. Geo-morphometric analysis using GIS provides a reduction in time required for quantifying the basin characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Wettable {{nonwoven}} topsheets {{are traditionally}} spunbond polypropylene nonwoven fabrics. The fluid handling performance of hydroentangled greige cotton nonwovens was studied {{to determine their}} suitability for <b>topsheet</b> applications based upon analysis of fluid rewet, strikethrough, and acquisition properties; and the relative contributions of nonwoven cotton’s cellulosic and wax components to hydrophobic and hydrophilic fluid transport properties are addressed. It was observed that mechanically cleaned greige cotton nonwovens exhibit certain fluid handling properties {{that are similar to}} polypropylene spunbond-meltblown topsheets, {{partly as a result of}} the residual wax content. Subsequently, the surface polarity, swelling, and moisture uptake of 100 % greige cotton and 50 : 50 blends of greige cotton and polypropylene hydroentangled nonwovens were studied in comparison with the performance of a commercially available 100 % polypropylene spunbond-meltblown topsheets. The surface polarity, swelling, and wettability values obtained from electrokinetic and water contact angle analysis were found to be in agreement with the hydrophobic polypropylene topsheets. Additionally, comfort assessment was undertaken based upon fabric handle profiles using the Leeds University Fabric Handle Evaluation System, which is an objective evaluation based on the quantification of fabric buckling deformations. Of the fabrics studied in this work, 50 : 50 greige cotton/polypropylene hydroentangled fabrics were the softest as determined by the Leeds University Fabric Handle Evaluation System and exhibited fluid handling properties consistent with the requirements of commercial topsheets...|$|E
40|$|Various hygiene products, notably {{incontinence}} pads, bring nonwoven “topsheet” fabrics {{into contact}} with individuals’ skin. This contact can damage the skin in various ways, including abrading it by friction, a mechanism enhanced {{by the presence of}} moisture. In recent years skin-nonwoven friction {{has been the subject of}} significant experimental study in the Continence and Skin Technology Group, UCL, in the course of which methods have been developed which can detect differences in friction between a chosen nonwoven and equivalent skin sites on different individuals under fixed conditions. The reasons for these differences are unknown; their elucidation is one focus of this work. The other is to establish the influence of coarse geometry on the dynamics of a tense nonwoven sheet sliding over a substrate and interacting with it by friction. The first part of this work (“microfriction”) is primarily experimental in nature, and involves two separate experiments. The first involves using a microscope with a shallow depth of field to determine the length of nonwoven fibre in contact with a facing surface as a function of pressure; the second consists of measuring friction between chosen nonwovens and a skin surrogate at a variety of pressures and speeds whilst simultaneously observing the behaviour of the interface down a microscope. Both techniques were extensively validated, and the data from the two experiments were then compared. It had originally been intended to conduct the friction experiment on skin (the other experiment does not require it), and though all equipment was developed with this in mind and all relevant permission was sought and obtained, it was not eventually possible. Instead, a skin friction surrogate (Lorica Soft) established in the literature was used. Data from this show that Amontons’ law (with respect to load) is obeyed to high precision (R 2 > 0. 999 in all cases), though there is the suggestion of sublinearity at low loads. Detailed consideration of the friction traces suggests that two different friction mechanisms are important, and comparison with the contact data suggests tentatively that they may correspond to adhesion between two different populations of contacts, one “rough” and one “smooth”. Further work applying these techniques to skin is necessary. The second aspect of the work is “geometric friction”; that is, the relationship between the geometry of a surface (on the centimetre scale and upwards) and the friction experienced by a compliant sheet (such as nonwoven <b>topsheet)</b> laid over it in tension. A general equation of motion for slippage between sheet and surface has been derived which in principle allows for both objects to deform and interact according to any plausible friction law. This has then been solved in integral form for Amontons’ law and a low density strip exhibiting no Poisson contraction sliding over any surface with zero Gaussian curvature; closed form solutions for the specific cases of a prism and a circular cone have then been derived and compared. Experimental verification has been provided by a colleague, which shows very good agreement between theory and experiment. It has also been shown that, taking a naïve approach, the classic model for a rigid cylinder can be applied even to a quite extreme cone with experimentally negligible error.
