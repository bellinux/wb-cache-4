5|$|At Cape Canaveral, {{the space}} shuttle Discovery was {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> on its launching pad after concerns of unfavorable weather, and NASA rescheduled a liftoff the following week; however, shuttle managers eventually decided to begin moving Discovery from the launching pad to ride out the storm. In Miami, the Booker T. Washington Senior High School opened as a voluntary evacuation shelter for all pre-registered special needs residents. Also, the MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa evacuated its aircraft to McConnell Air Force Base near Wichita.|$|E
5|$|Atypical {{antipsychotics}} are modestly {{useful in}} reducing aggression and psychosis {{in people with}} Alzheimer's disease, but their advantages are offset by serious adverse effects, such as stroke, movement difficulties or cognitive decline.

With the mission accomplished, Bond and Romanova leave Venice on a romantic boat ride, in which course Bond throws Grant's blackmail film into the canal.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the raid}} on 29 August, the Home Fleet sailed west to cover Convoy RA59A which had sailed from {{northern}} Russia on 28 August bound from the UK. Due to fuel shortages, Indefatigable and three destroyers detached {{later that day}} to return to Scapa Flow and Formidable with two destroyers followed 24 hours later. Duke of York and six destroyers remained on station in the Arctic Sea until 11:00 am on 1 September when the convoy was judged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> from attack.|$|E

5|$|A {{position}} paper {{published by the}} American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2007 warns {{that there is no}} valid medical reason to perform the procedure, which is not considered routine or accepted by the College; and it has not been proven <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> or effective. The potential risks include sexual dysfunction, infection, altered sensation, dyspareunia, adhesions and scarring. The College position is that it is untenable to recommend the procedure. The procedure is also not approved by the Food and Drug Administration or the American Medical Association, and no peer-reviewed studies have been accepted to account for either safety or effectiveness of this treatment.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{questions}} {{over the new}} ships' nomenclature came uncertainty about their actual role due to their lack of protection. If they were primarily to act as scouts for the battle fleet and hunter-killers of enemy cruisers and commerce raiders, then the seven inches of belt armour with {{which they had been}} equipped would be adequate. If, on the other hand, they were expected to reinforce a battle line of dreadnoughts with their own heavy guns, they were too thin-skinned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> from an enemy's heavy guns. The Invincibles were essentially extremely large, heavily armed, fast armoured cruisers. However, the viability of the armoured cruiser was already in doubt. A cruiser that could have worked with the Fleet might have been a more viable option for taking over that role.|$|E
5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, whole-body extract immunotherapy {{was widely}} used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used for ant stings. However, fatal failures were reported, and this led to scientists to research for alternative methods of desensitisation. Before 1986 allergic reactions were not recorded and there was no study on Myrmecia sting venom; whole body extracts were later used on patients during the 1990s, but this was found to be ineffective and was subsequently withdrawn. In 2003, ant venom immunotherapy was shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> and effective against Myrmecia venom.|$|E
5000|$|Autopilots/Computer Aided Tasks (CATs) - From a {{security}} {{point of view}} the effects of making a task more computer driven is {{in the favor of}} technological advance because there is less reaction time required and computational error than a human pilot. Due to reduced error and reaction times flights on average, using autopilot, have <b>been</b> shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safer.</b> Thus the technology has a direct impact on people by increasing their safety, and society affects the technology because people want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safer</b> so they <b>are</b> constantly trying <b>to</b> improve the autopilot systems.|$|R

5|$|Dragon Quest X {{is set in}} {{the world}} of Astoltia, with the player {{character}} being initially human before an attack by the Lord of Hell Nelgel forces their soul into the body of another race. Following this, they must gather magical gems to seal Nelgel once again, while the player character's sibling is sent back in time <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> from Nelgel. Gameplay follows a combination of elements from the Dragon Quest and other contemporary MMORPGs, such as real-time combat in an open world environment and a job system tied to skills and abilities.|$|E
5|$|Soon, all {{the bodies}} except that of Alexey, which was never found, had been recovered. Those {{of the last}} three to die—De Long, Ambler and Ah Sam—were some {{distance}} from the rest, where they had evidently attempted to set up a final camp on higher ground. Melville's party wrapped all the bodies in canvas, and carried them to a hill high enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> from seasonal flooding. There they placed them in a large coffin improvised from driftwood, which they covered with rocks surmounted by a large wooden cross, inscribed with the names of the lost men. Melville's group left the site on April 7, 1882, then spent a further month in the delta, searching without success for signs of Chipp and his crew.|$|E
5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, {{whole body}} extract immunotherapy was widely used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used on ants. However, fatal failures were reported and this led to scientists researching for alternative methods of desensitisation. Whole body extract immunotherapy was later proven to be ineffective, and venom immunotherapy was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> and effective to use. Paul Clarke first drew medical attention to the jack jumper ant in 1986, and before this, there had been no history of records of allergic reactions or study on their sting venom. The identification of venom allergens began in the early 1990s in preparation for therapeutic use. Whole body extracts were first used to desensitize patients, but it was found to be ineffective and later withdrawn. Venom immunotherapy was shown {{to reduce the risk of}} systemic reactions, demonstrating that immunotherapy can be provided for ant-sting allergies.|$|E
50|$|In 2003 P. L. Jacobsen {{compared}} {{rates of}} walking and cycling, {{in a range}} of countries, with rates of collisions between motorists and cyclists or walkers. He found an inverse correlation. This inverse correlation can be explained by theories including (1) safer walking and cycling conditions cause more people to walk and cycle, (2) more people walking and cycling cause walking and cycling <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safer,</b> and (3) external factors cause walking and cycling to increase while simultaneously causing walking and cycling <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safer.</b> For further discussion, see for example Correlation does not imply causation.|$|R

5|$|Chlorine is {{produced}} from sodium chloride (common salt, NaCl) using electrolysis {{to separate the}} metallic sodium from the chlorine gas. Usually the salt is dissolved in water to produce a brine. By-products of any such chloralkali process are hydrogen (H2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which is commonly called caustic soda or lye. By far the largest use of mercury in the late 20th century was in the mercury cell process (also called the Castner-Kellner process) where metallic sodium is formed as an amalgam at a cathode made from mercury; this sodium is then reacted with water to produce sodium hydroxide. Many of the industrial mercury releases of the 20th century came from this process, although modern plants claimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> in this regard. After about 1985, all new chloralkali production facilities that {{were built in the}} United States used membrane cell or diaphragm cell technologies to produce chlorine.|$|E
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) holds {{a drawing}} to {{determine}} who will fill the park's hummingbird feeders, a job reviled by the parks and recreation department. Jerry (Jim O'Heir), who is often mocked by his co-workers, is chosen because everybody writes down Jerry's name instead of their own. Later, Leslie receives a call from Ann (Rashida Jones) that Jerry is {{in the hospital with}} a dislocated shoulder. Jerry claims to have been mugged in the park, and Leslie decides nobody should tease Jerry anymore. When Jerry returns, he acts particularly buffoonish during a slideshow presentation, and ends up farting and splitting his pants, but everyone holds back laughter at Leslie's request. Leslie meets with Carl Lorthner (Andy Samberg), a park security ranger who is incredibly loud but oblivious to the fact. Leslie suggests Carl get more help for the park <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe.</b> Meanwhile, Ron (Nick Offerman) teaches a self-defense course {{to the rest of the}} department so they don't end up like Jerry.|$|E
5|$|Sudirman and {{his troops}} {{continued}} {{to make their way}} through the jungles and forests, eventually arriving at Sobo, near Mount Lawu, on 18February. During the journey, Sudirman used a radio set to convey orders to local TNI troops if he believed that the region was secure. Feeling weaker because of the physical hardships he had faced, including travelling through the forests and a lack of food, and believing the area <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe,</b> Sudirman decided that Sobo would serve as his guerrilla headquarters. The local commander, Lieutenant Colonel Wiliater Hutagalung, served as his go-between with the other TNI leaders. Aware that international opinion, which was beginning to condemn Dutch actions in Indonesia, could bring Indonesia greater recognition, Sudirman and Hutagalung discussed possible terms of action, before agreeing on a large-scale assault. Meanwhile, the Dutch began to spread propaganda claiming that they had captured Sudirman; this claim was intended to break the morale of the guerrillas.|$|E
