40|$|AbstractApplying {{compression}} and shear combined loading to pure iron, pure titanium {{and stainless steel}} powders with different hardness, the densification effect <b>by</b> <b>shear</b> loading was compared. For all powder the large density improvement <b>by</b> <b>shear</b> loading was seen. The density increment <b>by</b> <b>shear</b> loading greatly depended on the density namely residual cavities before shear loading. Then the density increment <b>by</b> <b>shear</b> loading was large for high hardness powder on 700 MPa. However, on 300 MPa the density increment for stainless powder was smaller than for titanium powder although the density before shear loading was lowest. This was because the plastic deformation of high hardness powder was not easily promoted even <b>by</b> <b>shear</b> loading in low compression pressure. The densification effect <b>by</b> {{compression and}} <b>shear</b> combined loading depends on the density before giving shear loading and the ease of powder plastic deformation...|$|R

The strains assuming forming <b>by</b> <b>shear</b> are found to be (much) higher than in situations of forming by stretch. This affects notably more fundamental studies on material behaviour in incremental forming. The effects are illustrated using experimental data obtained with pre-stressed material...|$|R
