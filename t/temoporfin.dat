Materials & methods: NPs were characterized for their photophysical properties, <b>temoporfin</b> release, cellular uptake and intracellular localization, and dark and photocytotoxicities of <b>temoporfin</b> by using A 549, MCF 10 A neoT and U 937 cell lines. In vivo imaging was performed on athymic nude-Foxn 1 mice. Results: <b>Temoporfin</b> was highly aggregated within the NPs {{and the release of}} <b>temoporfin</b> monomers was faster from PEGylated PLGA NPs than from non-PEGylated ones. PEGylation significantly reduced the cellular uptake of NPs by the differentiated promonocytic U 937 cells, revealing the stealth properties of the delivery system. Dark cytotoxicity of <b>temoporfin</b> delivered by NPs was less than that of free <b>temoporfin</b> in standard solution (Foscan (R), Biolitec AG [Jena, Germany]), whereas phototoxicity was not reduced. <b>Temoporfin</b> delivered to mice by PEGylated PLGA NPs exhibits therapeutically favorable tissue distribution.

40|$|The in vivo and {{in vitro}} {{metabolism}} of <b>temoporfin</b> (m-THPC), {{one of the}} most potent photosensitizers for the treatment of cancer by photodynamic therapy, has been studied in detail by HPLC with fluorescence and spectrophotometric detection and on-line HPLC-electrospray mass spectrometry. The results showed that <b>temoporfin</b> was not metabolized in vivo and was excreted unchanged via the biliary system into the faeces. No <b>temoporfin</b> or metabolites were detected in the urine. In vitro incubation of <b>temoporfin</b> with human and rat liver microsomal preparations in the presence of NADPH resulted in no metabolite production, even after enzyme induction with cytochrome P- 450 isoenzyme inducers such as phenobarbitone, dexamethasone and 3 -methylcholanthrene. No conjugation of <b>temoporfin</b> by phase II cytosolic enzymes was observed. It is concluded that the possible 'metabolites' previously observed were artifacts generated by photochemical oxidation of <b>temoporfin</b> to hydroxylated derivatives during the sample administration, collection, preparation and extraction procedures or were impurities already present in the original drug before administration for metabolic studies.

Among photosensitizers, m-THPC (<b>Temoporfin),</b> seems to be the most promising one for the treatment of brain tumors, but, unfortunately, it causes problems of high skin photosensitivity. To by-pass this problem, we devised an intratumoral route of administration of this photosensitizer. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate and compare the uptake of m-THPC in brain tumor and normal tissue after systemic and intratumoral administration of the drug. 30 female Wistar rats received m-THPC 12 days after C 6 tumor implantation. <b>Temoporfin</b> was administered intratumorally in 24 rats at two different concentrations. 6 rats constituted the control group and received m-THPC by means of an intraperitoneal injection.

40|$|As {{more and}} more antibiotic-resistant organisms are {{emerging}} continuously, {{the development of new}} antibiotics falls behind the evolution of antibiotic-resistance. Thus there is an urgent need to search for alternative antibacterial drugs. Nowadays, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (APDT) has emerged as an efficacious modality to treat various kinds of microbial infections. Meanwhile, liposomes are shown to be an attractive drug delivery system in the treatment of infections and may improve the APDT efficiency. Therefore, the aims of this study are to develop bacteria-targeting liposomes to further improve APDT, and to develop a high-throughput method for screening a large number of photosensitizer-loaded liposomal formulations. In publication 1 and 2, a generation II photosensitizer (PS), <b>temoporfin,</b> was incorporated into liposomes for APDT, afterwards two bacteria-targeting ligands, the antimicrobial peptide WLBU 2 and the lectin Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) were successfully coupled to the surface of temoporfin-loaded liposomes, respectively, using an aminogroup-reactive functional lipid: NHS-PEG 2000 -DSPE. The delivery of <b>temoporfin</b> to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, thus demonstrating that more <b>temoporfin</b> was delivered to bacteria by the modified liposomes than by unmodified liposomes. Consequently, both of the two bacteria-targeting liposomes eradicated all MRSA and enhanced the photodynamic inactivation of P. aeruginosa in the in vitro photodynamic inactivation test. In particular, WLBU 2 seems to be a better bacteria-targeting ligand than WGA. These results demonstrate that the strategy of using bacteria-targeting liposomes is promising for improving the APDT efficiency against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in the local infections. To speed up the screening process of liposomal formulations and develop a method suitable for large-scale production of liposomes, a novel strategy for the fast and convenient high-throughput screening of liposomal formulations was developed in Publication 3, utilizing the automation of the ethanol injection method. This strategy was illustrated by the preparation and screening of the liposomal formulation library of <b>temoporfin.</b> To optimize the formulations, different parameters were investigated, including lipid types, lipid concentration, the ratio of ethanol to aqueous solution, the ratio of drug to lipid and the addition of functional phospholipids. Numerous formulations (261 samples) were screened quickly in a high-throughput way. The factors affecting the properties of liposomes were investigated step-by-step, where liposomes were prepared and characterized automatically, making it easy and fast to optimize the liposomal formulations of <b>temoporfin.</b> The obtained optimized liposomes were unilamellar spheres with a diameter of about 50 nm, and were very stable for over 20 weeks. What’s more, this high-throughput method is also applicable for preparing bacteria-targeting liposomes of different compositions, showing many advantages over the conventional methods. All the results demonstrate that this high-throughput screening strategy is fast, automated, materially efficient, labor-saving, time-saving, economic, facile, and highly reproducible. This approach is promising for the development of new formulations to enhance APDT; {{due to the nature of}} the process, the approach is readily amenable to scale-up of production. In conclusion, bacteria-targeting liposomes are useful drug delivery system for APDT, and the high-throughput method will facilitate the search for more suitable liposomal formulations.

40|$|Background: The {{treatment}} of persistent and recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains a challenge, especially in Indonesia. We investigated {{the safety and}} efficacy of <b>temoporfin</b> mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) for patients with local persistent and recurrent NPC. Material and methods: Twenty-two patients with persistent and recurrent NPC (maximum tumor depth < 10 mm) underwent PDT under local anesthesia with use of a nasopharyngeal light applicator. Three different drug doses and light intervals have been administered: treatment arm A: 0. 15 mg/kg Foscan (R); 96 h drug-light interval; B: drug dose of 0. 10 mg/, 48 h drug-light interval; C: drug dose of 0. 075 mg/kg, 24 h drug-light interval. Toxicity was measured by using the CTCAE 3. 1 scale. Results: Arm A consisted of eight patients, arms B and C consisted of seven patients. The treatment procedure was well tolerable under local anesthesia. The most common grade III toxicities for all groups is headache (n= 7; 33 %). No grade IV toxicity was seen. One patient died 2 days after treatment due to a misdiagnosed pneumonia. In 17 of the 22 patients a biopsy was performed after 40 weeks and showed no tumor in all biopsies. Arm A seems, in addition to comparable toxicity, clinically more effective than arms B and C.

40|$|Due to {{the ongoing}} {{development}} of clinical photodynamic therapy (PDT), the search continues for optimized photosensitizers that can overcome some of the side effects associated {{with this type of}} treatment modality. The main protagonists being: post-treatment photosensitivity, due to only limited cellular selectivity and post-treatment tumor regrowth, due to the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory agents within the tumor microenvironment. A photosensitizer that could overcome one or both of these drawbacks would be highly attractive to those engaged in clinical PDT.

40|$|Liposomes are {{frequently}} used as pharmaceutical nanocarriers to deliver poorly water-soluble {{drugs such as}} <b>temoporfin,</b> cyclosporine A, amphotericin B, and paclitaxel to their target site. Optimal drug delivery depends on understanding the release kinetics of the drug molecules from the host liposomes during the journey to the target site and at the target site. Transfer of drugs in model systems consisting of donor liposomes and acceptor liposomes is known from experimental work to typically exhibit a first-order kinetics with a simple exponential behavior. In some cases, a fast component in the initial transfer is present, in other cases the transfer is sigmoidal. We present and analyze a theoretical model for the transfer that accounts for two physical mechanisms, collisions between liposomes and diffusion of the drug molecules through the aqueous phase. Starting with the detailed distribution of drug molecules among the individual liposomes, we specify the conditions that lead to an apparent first-order kinetic behavior. We also discuss possible implications on the transfer kinetics of (1) high drug loading of donor liposomes, (2) attractive interactions between drug molecules within the liposomes, and (3) slow transfer of drugs between {{the inner and outer}} leaflets of the liposomes...|$|E
40|$|The main {{theme of}} this thesis {{is the use of}} {{fluorescence}} spectroscopy in biomedicine. The work presented in the thesis can be divided into three areas of applications. The first area involves the use of fluorescence to find the location of a deeply situated fluorophore within turbid media. Fluorescence emitted from the fluorophore will be attenuated when propagating through the medium, due to the optical properties of the surroundings. The fluorescence light will be more attenuated at some wavelengths as the tissue optical properties are wavelength-dependent, and this difference will be more pronounced the longer the light travels. An intensity ratio of fluorescence at two selected wavelengths can therefore provide information about the depth of the inclusion. This has been investigated with both simulations and experiments with tissue phantoms. A further step has been to incorporate this depth-dependent ratio into a reconstruction algorithm used in fluorescence tomography. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a local treatment modality of tumors, requiring light, oxygen and an administered photosensitizer, which preferably accumulates in tumor tissue. The second main area in this thesis has been the study of the pharmacokinetics of a liposomal formulation of the photosensitizer <b>Temoporfin</b> in different animal tumor models. Fluorescence measurements have been performed in order to estimate the quantity of photosensitizer within tumor and normal tissues following either topical or systemical administration of the drug. These quantities were compared to the drug concentrations obtained with chemical extraction. Time intervals of 2 - 8 hours between administration and measurements were investigated. Absorption spectroscopy was also performed when using topical application of the drug, yielding a good correlation of photosensitizer concentration compared to extraction data. Tumor selectivity of this liposomal <b>Temoporfin</b> formulation was shown at these short time intervals. Fluorescence measurements have also been performed in a first clinical PDT trial using topical application of this new formulation. The final application utilizing fluorescence was to measure temperature optically. Certain crystals change their fluorescence spectrum when the temperature is altered. By attaching a crystal to a fiber tip, the temperature can be monitored at the position of the fiber. An intensity ratio of detected fluorescence in two wavelength bands can provide an estimate of the temperature. The temperature was monitored during a 10 minutes long light illumination on skin of a volunteer, indicating a temperature increase. The technique was also tested interstitially in meat, showing a temperature increase during the entire illumination as no perfusion was present, which normally stabilizes the temperature...|$|E

The effect of a liposomal formulation, {{as an example of a}} widely-used delivery system, on all aspects of the drug delivery process, including the drug's behavior in blood and in the tumor, has to be considered when optimizing treatment with liposomal drugs, but that is rarely done. This article presents a comparison of conventional (Foslip®) and polyethylene glycosylated (Fospeg®) liposomal formulations of <b>temoporfin</b> (meta-tetra[hydroxyphenyl]chlorin) in tumor-grafted mice, with a set of comparison parameters not reported before in one model.

The use of whole-tumor multiphoton fluorescence macroscopy imaging is reported for visualization of the in vivo intratumoral distribution of the photosensitizer.

In the present study, mTHPC was encapsulated in polymeric micelles based on benzyl-poly(ε-caprolactone) -b-methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (Ben-PCL-mPEG) using a film hydration method, with loading capacity of 17 %. Because of higher lipase activity in RAW 264. 7 macrophages than in C 166 endothelial cells, the former cells degraded the polymers faster, resulting in faster photosensitizer release and higher in vitro photocytotoxicity of mTHPC-loaded micelles in those macrophages. However, we observed release of mTHPC from the micelles in 30 min in blood plasma in vitro which explains the observed similar in vivo pharmacokinetics of the mTHPC micellar formulation and free mTHPC. Therefore, we could not translate the beneficial macrophage selectivity from in vitro to in vivo. Nevertheless, we observed accumulation of mTHPC in atherosclerotic lesions of mice aorta's which is probably the result of binding to lipoproteins upon release from the micelles.

Tumor response (World Health Organization criteria), quality of life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer :EORTC - Quality of Life Questionnaire QLQ-C 30 and QLQ-H&N 35) were assessed on an intention-to-treat basis. Treatment related toxicity (Common Toxicity Criteria : CTC) was documented rigorously. Results: 54 % [95 % CI: 37 %; 70 %] of 39 patients showed an objective tumor response (OR) and 49 % [95 % CI: 32 %; 65 %] achieved a complete response (CR; intention-to-treat analysis). Looking only at 31 evaluable patients OR was 67. 7 % and CR was 61. 3 %. At 40 weeks, a 90. 5 % [95 % CI: 69. 6 %; 98. 8 %] survival was observed in responders as opposed to 38. 9 % [95 % CI: 17. 3 %; 64. 3 %] for non-responders. At that point in time, between 50 and 100 % of patients reported improvement in most domains of the EORTC QLQ-C 30 and EORTC QLQ-H&N 35.

40|$|The recent {{progresses}} {{offered by}} nanotechnology in {{the manipulation of}} matter {{lead to the development}} of several nanoparticles (NPs) and nanodevices for medical applications. In oncology, nanosized objects are particularly attractive as drug delivery systems since it is expected that engineered nanovehicles of appropriate size and functionalised with specific ligands/antibodies will improve the efficacy and selectivity of cancer therapies by exploiting both the passive and active mechanism of tumour targeting. The use of delivery systems is particularly appealing in those therapies in which the administration of the drug in aqueous formulations leads to drug aggregation with decreased activity or scarce bioavailability and tumour selectivity. This is the case of most of the photosensitizers used in photodynamic therapy (PDT), which display hydrophobicity and poor selective accumulation in malignant tissues. In the last decades, PDT is emerging as a promising cancer treatment modality in alternative to conventional therapies, which often demonstrate systemic drug toxicity and multidrug-resistance phenomena. PDT is based on the administration of a photosensitizer (PS) that accumulates in the tumour and after activation with light of appropriate wavelengths, reacts with surrounding molecular oxygen leading to the formation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) with consequent cellular and vasculature damages. In this PhD thesis, three different nanosystems, namely, liposomes, poly-(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles (PLGA NPs) and ORganically Modified SILica nanoparticles (ORMOSIL NPs) were considered for the delivery of the second generation PS meta-tetra(hydroxyphenyl) chlorin (m-THPC, <b>Temoporfin)</b> to cancer cells in vitro.

The effect of a liposomal formulation, {{as an example of a}} widely-used delivery system, on all aspects of the drug delivery process, including the drug&# 39;s behavior in blood and in the tumor, has to be considered when optimizing treatment with liposomal drugs, but that is rarely done. This article presents a comparison of conventional (Foslip®) and polyethylene glycosylated (Fospeg®) liposomal formulations of <b>temoporfin</b> (meta-tetra[hydroxyphenyl]chlorin) in tumor-grafted mice, with a set of comparison parameters not reported before in one model. Foslip® and Fospeg® pharmacokinetics, drug release, liposome stability, tumor uptake, and intratumoral distribution are evaluated, and their influence on the efficacy of the photodynamic treatment at different light–drug intervals is discussed. The use of whole-tumor multiphoton fluorescence macroscopy imaging is reported for visualization of the in vivo intratumoral distribution of the photosensitizer. The combination of enhanced permeability and retention-based tumor accumulation, stability in the circulation, and release properties leads to a higher efficacy of the treatment with Fospeg® compared to Foslip®. A significant advantage of Fospeg® lies in a major decrease in the light–drug interval, while preserving treatment efficacy.
