[...] The bill also contained a further extension of unemployment benefits and the Medicare reimbursement rates. [...] The cost of <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> was not offset by spending cuts, but the other provisions were offset by cuts in federal healthcare and pension programs.

[...] His reaction to criticism was often severe, prompting his political enemies to derisively refer to him as [...] "Emperor Julian." [...] During the final year of Carroll's term, Lt. Gov. Stovall, who was left as acting governor when Carroll had left the state on business, called a special session of the legislature to enact a tax cut that Carroll opposed but later endorsed.

500|$|Howard {{toured the}} {{province}} advocating {{for the federal}} government to enter into Open skies agreements with Asian nations. He also advocated for the Harmonized Sales Tax. Howard remained loyal to Premier Campbell, praising his October 2010 announcement of using the remainder of the budget to cut income tax by 15%, two weeks before the Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services was to deliver its report on public consultation for budget priorities. After Campbell resigned, and <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> undone, the 2011 BC Liberal leadership election ensued. Along with Richmond's other two MLAs, John Yap and Linda Reid, Howard endorsed Kevin Falcon to be the new party leader, citing Falcon's willingness to listen to all arguments and saying [...] "I think he can bring a new dynamic, a youthful energy to the discussion; he's a great speaker, a great debater." [...] Christy Clark eventually won the leadership and became premier but, like Campbell, did not include Howard in the executive council. In March 2012, Premier Clark promoted Howard to a parliamentary secretary position under the Ministry of Transportation and directed to focus on air services agreements where he served until September. In early 2013, Howard was selected by BC Liberal caucus chair, Gordon Hogg, to assist with the party's investigation into the party's alleged use of government resources and employees in partisan promotional efforts in certain ethnic communities.|$|E
50|$|Critics {{claim that}} <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> worsened <b>the</b> deficits {{in the budget}} of the United States government.

Supporters of <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> also argue, by using <b>the</b> Laffer curve, <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> increased economic growth and government revenue. That is hotly disputed, and critics note that the 6% rise in government income tax receipts was due to the 12% inflation rate, not <b>tax</b> <b>cuts,</b> and would have risen more if <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> had not occurred. <b>The</b> Office of <b>Tax</b> Analysis estimates that the act lowered federal income tax revenue by 13%, relative to where it {{would have been in the}} bill's absence.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{important}} reason for the recent expansion of the AMT {{is the effect of}} <b>the</b> 2001-2006 Bush <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> decreased marginal <b>tax</b> rates for all income tax brackets without making corresponding changes to AMT rates. <b>The</b> lower <b>tax</b> liabilities triggered AMT eligibility for many households.

500|$|On December 17, 2011, the Senate passed {{legislation}} {{to extend the}} Social Security payroll tax cut which had been previously enacted during the FY2011 budget negotiations. [...] That legislation had reduced the rate from 6.2% to 4.2% for the 2011 calendar year only. [...] The initial 2012 extension was for two months, rather than the full-year extension which had been sought; the legislation also extended unemployment benefits {{as well as a}} measure preventing a drop in rates for Medicare reimbursement; the spending for these was offset by enacting new fees on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. [...] Points of contention included a Democratic plan to fund <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> with a new surtax on income over $1 million, which was dropped in later stages of negotiation, as well as attempts by Republicans to insert language which would speed the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, which had recently been delayed by the Obama administration. [...] The bill was initially rejected in the House, whose leaders insisted on a full-year extension, {{despite the fact that the}} Senate had already adjourned for the year. [...] However, after criticism from other Republicans that the impasse would harm their prospects in the upcoming 2012 elections, the House leadership on December 23, 2011 announced that it would pass the Senate bill in return for Democrats promptly beginning negotiations on a full-year extension. [...] The bill, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2011, was passed by the House and signed by the President later that day.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, the United States Congressional Budget Office (CBO) {{released}} a paper called [...] "Analyzing the Economic and Budgetary Effects of a 10 Percent Cut in Income Tax Rates'. This paper considered {{the impact of}} a stylized reduction of 10% in the then existing marginal rate of federal income tax in the US (for example, if those facing a 25% marginal federal income tax rate had it lowered to 22.5%). Unlike earlier research, the CBO paper estimates the budgetary impact of possible macroeconomic effects of tax policies, that is, it attempts to account for how reductions in individual income tax rates might affect the overall future growth of the economy, and therefore influence future government tax revenues; and ultimately, impact deficits or surpluses. In the paper's most generous estimated growth scenario, only 28% of the projected lost revenue from the lower tax rate would be recouped over a 10-year period after a 10% across-the-board reduction in all individual income tax rates. In other words, deficits would increase by nearly the same amount as <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> in the first five years, with limited feedback revenue thereafter. Through increased budget deficits, the tax cuts primarily benefiting the wealthy will be paid for—plus interest—by taxes borne relatively evenly by all taxpayers. The paper points out that these projected shortfalls in revenue would have to be made up by federal borrowing: the paper estimates that the federal government would pay an extra US$200 billion in interest over the decade covered by the paper's analysis.|$|E

40|$|Since 2001 Congress {{has passed}} a major tax bill almost every year. Most have reduced taxes {{significantly}} and, since they were not accompanied by spending cuts, the resulting deficits have also increased the national debt.
