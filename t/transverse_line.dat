5|$|The Japanese sleeper ray has {{an almost}} {{circular}} pectoral fin disc wider than long. Two large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{under the skin}} {{on either side of}} the head. The small, protruding eyes are immediately followed by larger spiracles with prominently raised, smooth rims. The nostrils are small and placed close together, and between them is a curtain of skin that overlaps the mouth. The protrusible mouth forms a short, <b>transverse</b> <b>line</b> and is surrounded by a deep groove. There are fewer than 25 tooth rows in each jaw, arranged into bands; the teeth are small with oval bases and pointed crowns. Five pairs of short gill slits are located on the underside of the disc.|$|E
5|$|The cookiecutter shark has an elongated, cigar-shaped {{body with}} a short, bulbously rounded snout. The {{nostrils}} have a very short flap of skin in front. The large, oval, green eyes are placed forward on the head, though not {{so that there is}} extensive binocular vision. Behind the eyes are large spiracles, positioned on the upper surface of the head. The mouth is short, forming a nearly <b>transverse</b> <b>line,</b> and is surrounded by enlarged, fleshy, suctorial lips. There are 3037 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2531 tooth rows in the lower jaw, increasing with body size. The upper and lower teeth are extremely different: the upper teeth are small, narrow, and upright, tapering to a single, smooth-edged cusp. The lower teeth are also smooth-edged, but much larger, broader, and knife-like, with their bases interlocking to form a single saw-like cutting edge. The five pairs of gill slits are small.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{is similar}} to that of Madagascan Paratriaenops, but the premaxilla is longer. The rostrum (front part of the skull) is {{well-developed}} and contains a pronounced nasal swelling, which is less pronounced than in Paratriaenops; the depression behind the swelling is relatively shallow. Compared to other species of Triaenops, the rostrum is relatively narrow and short, similar to T.parvus; T.afer and T.persicus have a broader rostrum. The front margin of the rostrum is cast back between the left and right corners. A <b>transverse</b> <b>line</b> passes over the roof of the rostrum. The infraorbital foramen, an opening in the skull, is oblong in shape. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are not broadened towards the sides, are connected to the maxillaries by broad bones, and contain clear crests on their upper sides. In T.menamena, these crests are rectangular in form and larger than in Paratriaenops. The braincase is lower than in other species of Triaenops. The sagittal crest, which is on the roof of the braincase, is poorly developed. In the mandible, the coronoid process is blunt and rounded, but the angular process (both processes at the back of the bone) is small.|$|E

25|$|This species resembles Vanessa cardui but {{the ground}} colour is darker {{both on the}} uppersides and undersides, and the orange {{markings}} are deeper and richer in tint. It also differs as follows: underside forewing: the ochraceous orange-red on disc, and across cell proportionately of less extent, and uniform, not getting paler towards {{the apex of the}} cell; the upper four spots of the preapical transverse series on the black apical area minute. It is about 5inches (13cm) in length. Hindwing: the postdiscal transverse band much narrower and shorter, not extending below vein 1, margined inwardly by a series of broad black subcrescentic marks; the tornal angle with a small patch of violet scales bordered inwardly by a short black <b>transverse</b> <b>line.</b> Underside very much darker than in V. cardui, the orange red on the disc and in the cell on the forewing restricted as on the upperside; three small transversely placed blue spots beyond the cell. Hindwing: the mottling comparatively very dark, purplish blade, with slender white margins, shaded on disc with rich dark olive-brown; the postdiscal series of ocelli dark and somewhat obscure; an inner subterminal transverse series of blue, and an outer very much slenderer transverse series of black lunules. Cilia of both forewings and hindwings white, alternated with brown. Antenna black, tipped with pale ochraceous; head, thorax and abdomen with dark olive-brown pubescence; beneath, the palpi, thorax and abdomen pale ochraceous brown.|$|E

60|$|When the lobes, {{which are}} rather thick, close, {{no trace of}} {{wrinkling}} {{can be seen on}} any part of their upper [page 317] surfaces, It appears therefore that the cells must contract. The chief seat of the movement is evidently in the thick mass of cells which overlies the central bundle of vessels in the midrib. To ascertain whether this part contracts, a leaf was fastened on the stage of the microscope in such a manner that the two lobes could not become quite shut, and having made two minute black dots on the midrib, in a <b>transverse</b> <b>line</b> and a little towards one side, they were found by the micrometer to be 17/1000 of an inch apart. One of the filaments was then touched and the lobes closed; but as they were prevented from meeting, I could still see the two dots, which now were 15/1000 of an inch apart, so that {{a small portion of the}} upper surface of the midrib had contracted in a <b>transverse</b> <b>line</b> 2/1000 of an inch (.0508 mm.).|$|E

60|$|The wing-feathers, {{bearing the}} ocelli, {{are covered with}} dark stripes or rows of dark spots, each stripe or row running obliquely down the outer side of the shaft to an ocellus. The spots are {{generally}} elongated in a <b>transverse</b> <b>line</b> to the row in which they stand. They often become confluent, either {{in the line of}} the row—and then they form a longitudinal stripe—or transversely, that is, with the spots in the adjoining rows, and then they form transverse stripes. A spot sometimes breaks up into smaller spots, which still stand in their proper places.|$|E
60|$|I have {{carefully}} examined skulls of ten large lop-eared rabbits, and of five common domestic rabbits, which latter {{differ from}} the lop-eared only in not having such large bodies or ears, yet both larger than in the wild rabbit. First for the ten lop-eared rabbits: in all these the skull is remarkably elongated in comparison with its breadth. In a wild rabbit the length was 3.15 inches, in a large fancy rabbit 4.3; whilst {{the breadth of the}} cranium enclosing the brain was in both almost exactly the same. Even by taking as the standard of comparison the widest part of the zygomatic arch, the skulls of the lop-eared are proportionally to their breadth three-quarters of an inch too long. The depth of the head has increased almost in the same proportion with the length; it is the breadth alone which has not increased. The parietal and occipital bones enclosing the brain are less arched, both in a longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>line,</b> than in the wild rabbit, so that the shape of the cranium is somewhat different. The surface is rougher, less cleanly sculptured, and the lines of sutures are more prominent.|$|E
60|$|Cirri.--First pair lost. The {{arrangement}} of the spines on all is most abnormal, Pl. X, fig. 29: dorsal tuft long, arranged in a <b>transverse</b> <b>line</b> and seated in a deep notch; in the sixth cirrus, the spines on the lower segments are fine, those on the upper segments are thick and claw-like, mingled with some fine spines; in the four anterior cirri the spines of the dorsal tufts are even thicker and more claw-like. On the anterior faces, also, of all the segments the spines form a single row; they are shorter than those composing the dorsal tuft; hence the spines on each segment are arranged in a circle, interrupted widely on the two sides: this arrangement is common to all five posterior cirri. Second cirrus, with the anterior ramus one third longer and thinner than the posterior ramus (this is the reverse of the usual arrangement); this longer ramus equals in length the sixth cirrus. Third cirrus, with the anterior ramus considerably longer than the posterior ramus; in the three posterior pair of cirri, also, the anterior rami are {{a little longer than}} the posterior: except in length, there is little difference of any kind between the five posterior pair of cirri. Pedicels of the cirri long; rami rather short; segments elongated, not protuberant.|$|E

60|$|In {{the tenth}} chapter {{it was shown}} that the sensitive- [page 275] ness of the leaves appears to be wholly {{confined}} to the glands and to the immediately underlying cells. It was further shown that the motor impulse and other forces or influences, proceeding from the glands when excited, pass through the cellular tissue, and not along the fibro-vascular bundles. A gland sends its motor impulse with great rapidity down the pedicel of the same tentacle to the basal part which alone bends. The impulse, then passing onwards, spreads on all sides to the surrounding tentacles, first affecting those which stand nearest and then those farther off. But by being thus spread out, and from {{the cells of the}} disc not being so much elongated as those of the tentacles, it loses force, and here travels much more slowly than down the pedicels. Owing also to the direction and form of the cells, it passes with greater ease and celerity in a longitudinal than in a <b>transverse</b> <b>line</b> across the disc. The impulse proceeding from the glands of the extreme marginal tentacles {{does not seem to have}} force enough to affect the adjoining tentacles; and this may be in part due to their length. The impulse from the glands of the next few inner rows spreads chiefly to the tentacles on each side and towards the centre of the leaf; but that proceeding from the glands of the shorter tentacles on the disc radiates almost equally on all sides.|$|E
60|$|To {{test the}} {{correctness}} of this view, a small plant, growing in light peaty earth {{in a pot}} (only 4 1/2 by 4 1/2 inches outside measure) was copiously watered, and then kept without {{a drop of water}} in the hothouse. Two of the upper tubers were beforehand uncovered and measured, and then loosely covered up again. In a fortnight's time the earth in the pot appeared extremely dry; but not until the thirty-fifth day were the leaves in the least affected; they then became slightly reflexed, though still soft and green. This plant, which bore only ten tubers, would no doubt have resisted the drought for even a longer time, had I not previously removed three of the tubers and cut off several long rhizomes. When, on the thirty-fifth day, the earth in the pot was turned out, it appeared as dry as the dust on a road. All the tubers had their surfaces much wrinkled, instead of being smooth and tense. They had all shrunk, but I cannot say accurately how much; for as they were at first symmetrically oval, I measured only their length and thickness; but they contracted in a <b>transverse</b> <b>line</b> much more in one direction than in another, so as to become greatly flattened. One of the two tubers which had been measured was now three-fourths of its original length, and two-thirds of its original thickness in the direction in which it had been measured, but in another direction only one- third of its former thickness. The other tuber was one-fourth shorter, one-eighth less thick in the direction in which it had been measured, and only half as thick in another direction.|$|E
60|$|The latter (D) alone {{remain to}} be described; they present far more {{diversity}} in shape than do the thoracic ganglia; they are almost always seen in outline to be laterally distinct, and usually resemble two pears with their tapering ends cut off and united; in a <b>transverse</b> <b>line</b> they are {{as long as the}} infra-oesophageal ganglion, but are much less massive. In Lepas fascicularis (D), they are pear-shaped; in Pollicipes mitella they are globular, and separated by a third globular ganglion, which I believe is the ophthalmic ganglion, presently to be described; in Pollicipes spinosus, however, the ophthalmic ganglion is, as usual, placed in advance of the supra-oesophageal ganglion, which latter, in this one species, shows no sign of being formed of a lateral pair fused together. In Alepas cornuta the supra-oesophageal ganglion consists of two quite distinct ganglia, elongated in the longitudinal axis of the body, and separated from each other by the whole width of the mouth; the chord which unites them is of the same thickness {{as the rest of the}} collar. In all the genera, from the front of each of the two supra-oesophageal ganglia, a pair of nerves, (f, f,) united and together as large as the collar nerve, rises, and can be traced running unbranched, in a nearly straight line, for a length equalling the whole rest of the nervous chord, so as to supply the peduncle and the inside of the capitulum or sack. At the inner ends of these two same ganglia, from a central point where they are united, a little central branch runs in front to the adductor scutorum and other adjoining muscles; and still smaller fibrils run behind to the oesophageal muscles.|$|E

60|$|With {{respect to}} the nature of the motor impulse which is {{transmitted}} from the glands down the pedicels and across the disc, it seems not improbable that it is closely allied to that influence which causes the protoplasm within the cells of the glands and tentacles to aggregate. We have seen that both forces originate in and proceed from the glands within a few seconds of the same time, and are excited by the same causes. The aggregation of the protoplasm lasts almost as long as the tentacles remain inflected, even though this be for more than a week; but the [page 259] protoplasm is redissolved at the bending place shortly before the tentacles re-expand, showing that the exciting cause of the aggregating process has then quite ceased. Exposure to carbonic acid causes both the latter process and the motor impulse to travel very slowly down the tentacles. We know that the aggregating process is delayed in passing through the cell- walls, and we have good reason to believe that this holds good with the motor impulse; for we can thus understand the different rates of its transmission in a longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>line</b> across the disc. Under a high power the first sign of aggregation is the appearance of a cloud, and soon afterwards of extremely fine granules, in the homogeneous purple fluid within the cells; and this apparently is due to the union of molecules of protoplasm. Now it does not seem an improbable view that the same tendency--namely for the molecules to approach each other--should be communicated to the inner surfaces of the cell-walls which are in contact with the protoplasm; and if so, their molecules would approach each other, and the cell-wall would contract.|$|E
