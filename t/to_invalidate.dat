5|$|Fettering of {{discretion}} {{by a public}} authority {{is one of the}} grounds of judicial review in Singapore administrative law. It is regarded as a form of illegality. An applicant may challenge a decision by an authority on the basis that it has either rigidly adhered to a policy it has formulated, or has wrongfully delegated the exercise of its statutory powers to another body. If the High Court finds that a decision-maker has fettered its discretion, it may hold the decision to be ultra vires – beyond the decision-maker's powers – and grant the applicant a suitable remedy such as a quashing order <b>to</b> <b>invalidate</b> the decision.|$|E

5|$|For all {{the claims}} about the {{potential}} for violence, election day, November 7, remained mostly calm across the state. Fewer than a dozen people were arrested statewide. Voting returns were slow, and on election night, the race was still too close to call. When the official tally was announced, Taylor had won by a vote of 193,714 to 191,331. Former governor John Y. Brown, nominated by a dissident group of Democrats, had garnered 12,040 votes, and Populist candidate John G. Blair had captured 2,936. Though the Board of Elections was thought to be controlled by Goebel, it rendered a surprise 2–1 decision to certify the election results.

5|$|One of the {{few times}} a federal court was asked <b>to</b> <b>invalidate</b> a law or action on Third Amendment grounds was in Engblom v. Carey (1982). In 1979, prison {{officials}} in New York organized a strike; they were evicted from their prison facility residences, which were reassigned to members of the National Guard who had temporarily taken their place as prison guards. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled: (1) that the term owner in the Third Amendment includes tenants (paralleling similar cases regarding the Fourth Amendment, governing search and seizure), (2) National Guard troops count as soldiers {{for the purposes of the}} Third Amendment, and (3) that the Third Amendment is incorporated (that is, that it applies to the states) by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case was remanded to the district court, which dismissed the case on the grounds that state officials could not have been aware of this interpretation.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1956 {{the states}} of India were reorganised by language. Hyderabad state was split into three parts, which were merged with {{neighbouring}} states to form the modern states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The nine Telugu- and Urdu-speaking districts of Hyderabad State in the Telangana region were merged with the Telugu-speaking Andhra State to create Andhra Pradesh, with Hyderabad as its capital. Several protests, known collectively as the Telangana movement, attempted <b>to</b> <b>invalidate</b> the merger and demanded {{the creation of a}} new Telangana state. Major actions took place in 1969 and 1972, and a third began in 2010. The city suffered several explosions: one at Dilsukhnagar in 2002 claimed two lives; terrorist bombs in May and August 2007 caused communal tension and riots; and two bombs exploded in February 2013. On 30 July 2013 the government of India declared that part of Andhra Pradesh would be split off to form a new Telangana state, and that Hyderabad city would be the capital city and part of Telangana, while the city would also remain the capital of Andhra Pradesh for no more than ten years. On 3 October 2013 the Union Cabinet approved the proposal, and in February 2014 both houses of Parliament passed the Telangana Bill. With the final assent of the President of India in June 2014, Telangana state was formed.|$|E

40|$|Serum immunoreactive {{erythropoietin}} (EPO) {{was measured}} sequentially in 8 patients with thalassaemia major. The EPO levels were distinctly increased before transfusion; {{they did not}} significantly change just after transfusion, but subsequently decreased. Pretransfusion EPO levels {{were similar to those}} observed in patients with non renal non inflammatory anaemias of the same severity. Our results show that production of EPO is appropriately increased in thalassaemia major and confirm that stimulation of endogenous erythropoiesis is not completely suppressed by the hypertransfusion regimen commonly used in this disease. As hyperstimulated ineffective erythropoiesis may lead <b>to</b> <b>invalidating</b> complications, we suggest that serum EPO measurements, which are now easily and reliably performed, should be used in monitoring the therapy of thalassaemia major.

5|$|Although Democratic-Republicans held {{a narrow}} {{majority}} in the Senate, the Federalist senators were both experienced and devoted their cause. Breckinridge acted as floor leader for the Democratic-Republicans and newly elected president, Thomas Jefferson. His proposed repeal of the Federalist-supported Judicial Act of 1801, which had {{increased the number of}} federal courts and judges, was particularly controversial. On January 4, 1802, he presented caseload data to argue that the new courts and judges were unnecessary. Federalist leader Gouverneur Morris countered that the proposal was unconstitutional; once established, courts were inviolate, he maintained. On January 20, Federalist Jonathan Dayton moved to return the bill to a committee to consider amendments. South Carolina's John E. Colhoun, a Democratic-Republican, voted with the Federalists, and the result was a 15–15 tie. Empowered to break the tie, Jefferson's vice president, Aaron Burr, voted with the Federalists. The five-man committee consisted of three Federalists, enough to prevent the bill's return to the floor, but when Vermont Senator Stephen R. Bradley, who had traveled home because of a family illness, returned to the chamber, the Democratic-Republicans regained a majority and introduced a successful discharge petition. In one last attempt to derail the legislation in debate, Federalists argued that the judiciary would strike down the repeal as unconstitutional; Breckinridge denied the notion that the courts had the power <b>to</b> <b>invalidate</b> an act of Congress. On February 3, the Senate repealed the act by a vote of 16–15, with the House concurring a month later.|$|E

Likewise, Goldstein stated that the critique that the liberal justices are more likely <b>to</b> <b>invalidate</b> acts of Congress, show inadequate deference to the political process, and be disrespectful of precedent, also lacked merit: Thomas has most often called for overruling prior precedent (even if long standing) that he views as having been wrongly decided, and during the 2009 term Scalia and Thomas voted most often <b>to</b> <b>invalidate</b> legislation.|$|E
40|$|With {{the wide}} support for object {{serialization}} in object-oriented programming languages, persistent objects have become common place and most large object-oriented software systems rely on extensive amounts of persistent data. Such systems also evolve over time. Retrieving previously persisted objects from classes whose schema {{has changed is}} however difficult, and may lead <b>to</b> <b>invalidating</b> {{the consistency of the}} application. The ESCHER framework addresses these issues through an IDE-integrated approach that handles class schema evolution by managing versions of the code and generating transformation functions automatically. The infrastructure also enforces class invariants to prevent the introduction of potentially corrupt objects. This article describes a model for class attribute changes, a measure for class evolution robustness, four empirical studies, and the design and implementation of the ESCHER system.

5000|$|Versata {{challenged}} {{the authority of}} the USPTO <b>to</b> <b>invalidated</b> CBM patents under § 101. It argued that the AIA limits invalidation to issues of prior art and obviousness under 35 U.S.C. §§ 102-103; the AIA permits invalidation as to a “condition of patentability,” but patent ineligibility under § 101 involves issues that the patent statute does not classify as a condition of patentability. The USPTO argued, however, that the legislative history made it clear that “the very purpose of the special CBM process was to permit the USPTO to reconsider the validity of a salient category of business method patents.” The court agreed with the USPTO: “It would require a hyper-technical adherence to form rather than an understanding of substance to arrive at a conclusion that § 101 is not a ground available to test patents.” ...|$|R
