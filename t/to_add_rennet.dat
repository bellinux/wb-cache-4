It is named after the city of Olomouc where it was originally sold. It is made from skim cow's milk without <b>adding</b> <b>rennet,</b> colourings, flavourings and stabilizers, and contains only 0.6% of fat.|$|R
50|$|The {{cheese is}} made by inoculating warmed cow milk with {{mesophilic}} bacteria, then <b>adding</b> <b>rennet</b> and allowing the mixture to coagulate. The curd is then cut into roughly 1 cm (1/2 inch) cubes, salted, and transferred to low cylindrical camembert molds. The molds are turned every six to twelve hours to allow the whey to drain evenly from the cut curds; after 48 hours, each mold contains a flat, cylindrical, solid cheese mass weighing generally 250 grams (about 9 oz). At this point the fresh cheese is hard, crumbly, and bland.|$|R

5000|$|Sweden: Swedish-style cheesecake differs {{greatly from}} other cheesecakes. A Swedish cheesecake is not layered and is {{traditionally}} produced by <b>adding</b> <b>rennet</b> <b>to</b> milk {{and letting the}} casein coagulate. It is then baked in an oven and served warm. Since the process of curdling milk is somewhat complicated, alternative recipes intended for home cooking instead use cottage cheese as a base to simulate {{the texture of the}} dessert. Swedish-style cheesecake is traditionally served with jam and whipped cream. There are two different types of Swedish cheesecake from different regions in Sweden. To avoid confusion with other cheesecakes, Swedish cheesecake is usually called ostkaka.|$|R
40|$|The National Dairy School in Mamirole, Doubs (France) has {{developed}} a simple and inexpensive procedure to transform milk powder into cheese and thus help to improve both the food and health situation in Third World countries. The procedure consists of mixing the milk powder with {{only half of the}} water normally used to make milk. One <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> this <b>rennet,</b> calcium salts and lactic fermentation agents. The mixture is then left to stand for about twelve hours. It is then poured into a container simultaneously with water heated to 80 - 85 oC. Coagulation is immediate and the curds float to the surface. It is then moulded and results in a cheese similar to Gouda. It takes about a year to train a technician to master this process, but the equipment is simple to use. The school in Mamirolle has created a technical assistance service to help set up such processing centres, the first of which is to be established in Mali.

5000|$|It {{is created}} by <b>adding</b> <b>rennet</b> <b>to</b> buttermilk, {{resulting}} in curd production. This is then formed and cut, before being pressed lightly into a cylindrical mould. These rounds are then submerged in a bath of brine for 24 hours to cause {{the production of a}} rind. Rice flour is used to dust the outside of the cheese, resulting in a white colour for the rind. The cheese ripens quickly, in as little as two weeks. The acid production of the cheese is initially slow, but builds up. This and the low temperature used during production mean that the acid naturally dries out the curd, causing the crumbly texture. The cheese is nicknamed [...] "The Crumblies".|$|R

5000|$|A {{required}} step in cheesemaking is {{separating the}} milk into solid curds and liquid whey. Usually {{this is done}} by acidifying (souring) the milk and <b>adding</b> <b>rennet.</b> The acidification can be accomplished directly {{by the addition of}} an acid, such as vinegar, in a few cases (paneer, queso fresco). More commonly starter bacteria are employed instead which convert milk sugars into lactic acid. The same bacteria (and the enzymes they produce) also play a large role in the eventual flavor of aged cheeses. Most cheeses are made with starter bacteria from the Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, or Streptococcus families. Swiss starter cultures also include Propionibacter shermani, which produces carbon dioxide gas bubbles during aging, giving Swiss cheese or Emmental its holes (called [...] "eyes").|$|R
5000|$|Mizithra is {{made from}} raw, whole ewe's or goat's milk in the {{simplest}} way possible: milk is brought to a slow boil {{for a few minutes}} and then curdled by <b>adding</b> <b>rennet</b> or whey from a previous batch (see below) or else some acidic substance such as lemon juice, vinegar or even a fresh broken fig tree sprig. As soon as curds have formed they are poured into a cheesecloth bag and hung to drain. The whey dripping out of the bag can be used to curdle the next batch of mizithra. After a few days mizithra forms a sweet, moist, soft mass molded in the shape of the hanging bag with a rounded bottom and a conical, wrinkly top. At this stage it is called [...] "sweet" [...] or [...] "fresh mizithra" [...] and may be eaten or, often, baked in pies.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the process of cheesemaking of Serra cheese, the most famous traditional Portuguese cheese manufactured with raw ewes' milk at farm level, several cheeses were produced according to a second-order composite factorial design using temperature of coagulation, amount of plant <b>rennet</b> <b>added</b> and amount of salt <b>added</b> <b>to</b> fresh cheese as the manipulated technological variables. Sensory, microbiological, physicochemical and biochemical analyses were carried out for all experimental cheeses and for two cheeses manufactured by traditional practices. The amount of salt <b>added</b> <b>to</b> fresh cheese affected significantly the sensory, microbiological and biochemical characteristics of 60 day-old Serra cheese, whereas the amount of plant <b>rennet</b> <b>added</b> and the coagulation temperature affected significantly only the sensory and microbiological attributes. None of the three technological parameters at the levels tested played a statistical role at the 5 % significance level in the chemical composition of the cheese. It was found that 0. 3 g of plant <b>rennet</b> <b>added</b> per litre of milk, a coagulation temperature of 28 °C, and 0. 05 g of salt added per cm 2 of fresh cheese surface provide the best quality of cheese in terms of highest sensory scores and lowest numbers of viable enterococci and coliforms...|$|R
50|$|Curds are a {{dairy product}} {{obtained}} by coagulating {{milk in a}} process called curdling. The coagulation {{can be caused by}} <b>adding</b> <b>rennet</b> or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to sit. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid masses, or curds. Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheeses are produced this way. Producing cheese curds {{is one of the first}} steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey proteins, is the whey. In cow's milk, 80 percent of the proteins are caseins.|$|R
50|$|When {{during the}} {{fermentation}} the cheesemaker has gauged that sufficient lactic acid has been developed, <b>rennet</b> is <b>added</b> <b>to</b> cause the casein to precipitate. Rennet contains the enzyme chymosin which converts κ-casein to para-κ-caseinate (the main component of cheese curd, {{which is a}} salt of one fragment of the casein) and glycomacropeptide, which is lost in the cheese whey. As the curd is formed, milk fat is trapped in a casein matrix. After <b>adding</b> the <b>rennet,</b> the cheese milk is left to form curds {{over a period of}} time.|$|R
50|$|Picodon is {{made from}} milk with only a small {{quantity}} of <b>rennet</b> <b>added</b> before being poured into small moulds dotted with tiny holes. Lactic protein, frozen curd, and concentrated or powdered milk are all prohibited by regulation. The cheese is twice salted using fine, dry salt. The cheese is left to dry for at least fourteen days, although four weeks is more common.|$|R
5000|$|In general, {{the milk}} is raw milk (whole or 3.3%). The milk must be [...] "ripened" [...] before <b>adding</b> in the <b>rennet.</b> The term {{ripening}} means allowing the Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to turn lactose into lactic acid, which lowers the pH of the solution, greatly aiding in the coagulation of the milk.
