5|$|The game also {{includes}} vehicle sections, where Drake must protect the jeep he and Elena are in using a mounted turret, and where Drake and Elena ride a jet ski along water-filled routes while avoiding enemy fire and explosive barrels. While players direct Drake in driving the jet ski, {{they may also}} switch to Elena by aiming <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> order to use her weapon — either the grenade launcher or the Beretta, depending on the chapter — in defense, or to clear the barrels from their path.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{testing of}} the {{prototype}} QF 25-pounder Short was completed in early December 1942. The 2/1st Field Regiment also trialled <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> New Guinea during early 1943. Large-scale production began in early 1943, after minor modifications {{were made to the}} design, and the Army placed an initial order for 112 guns. A second order was later placed for 100 more. This lot incorporated the Mark II carriage, which had larger wheels and tyres to prevent the problem with wheel bounce encountered by the first lot. Altogether, 213 guns were manufactured by the time production ceased in 1944. As completed, the gun's full designation was Ordnance QF 25-pounder Short (Aust) Mark I, but it was nicknamed the 'snort' by Australian soldiers.|$|E

Its armament {{consisted of two}} 12-inch breech-loading rifles on disappearing carriages. The battery was decommissioned in 1923. The Army removed the breechblocks and plugged the breeches before abandoning <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> place. <b>The</b> Army scrapped <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1940s.|$|R

5|$|Shay {{was found}} dead in a Kansas City hotel room on December 1, 1927. He was found with a gunshot wound to the head. Police {{officials}} initially said that the manner of death could have been either suicide or murder. Shay stayed in his room on the day that he died. A porter went to check on him that evening and found him on the floor with a pistol a few inches from his right hand. When physicians examined Shay's body, they found that a bullet had entered the right ear and exited the back of the head. Shay had lost the use of his right arm and hand after a stroke. Police said that if Shay were holding <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> his left hand, {{it would not have been}} easy for him to shoot himself in the right side of the head.|$|E
5|$|The {{police at}} first {{believed}} that Sheila, diagnosed with schizophrenia, had fired the shots then turned {{the gun on}} herself. But weeks after the murders Jeremy Bamber's ex-girlfriend told police that he had implicated himself. The prosecution argued that, motivated by a large inheritance, Bamber had shot the family with his father's semi-automatic rifle, then placed <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> his unstable sister's hands {{to make it look}} like a murder–suicide. A silencer the prosecution said was on the rifle would have made it too long, they argued, for Sheila's fingers to reach the trigger to shoot herself. Bamber was convicted of five counts of murder in October 1986 by a 10–2 majority, sentenced to a minimum of 25 years, and informed in 1994 that he would never be released. The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict in 2002.|$|E
5|$|On 11 September, the {{division}} {{returned to the}} line near Gouzeaucourt; the Germans had dug in along a ridge line from Épehy to Trescault intending to delay the British from reaching the Hindenberg Line. The Fourth Army was tasked with clearing these positions. On 18 September, the Battle of Épehy was fought. The division attacked at 05:40 with the 113th and 114th Brigades. For his role during the assault, William Allison White earned the VC. Alone, he assaulted a machine gun post that was hindering the advance, killing the defenders and capturing the gun. He then launched a second attack, accompanied by two others who were killed, to seize another German machine gun position killing a further five and again capturing <b>the</b> <b>gun.</b> <b>In</b> a third action, White led a small group to overwhelm a German defensive position that was also holding up the advance. He proceeded to organise the defence of the position, and fought off a German counterattack with heavy losses using captured machine guns. Both brigades were able to reach their objectives despite flanking fire, and fought off numerous counter-attacks. Despite this, the Germans were able to cling on to Gouzeaucourt. The battle cleared the German outposts {{in front of the}} Hindenburg Line, preparing the way for future operations. On 20 September, {{the division}} was pulled off the line for a period of rest.|$|E

50|$|She {{was built}} at Chatham, on a slipway {{adjoining}} that on which , who would precede her into service by some seven months, was being built. She was designed {{at a time}} when the shortcomings of the traditional broadside battery - limited axial fire, low command, inactivity of half <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> single-ship duels, heavy crew and difficulty <b>in</b> working <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> seaway - were stimulating designers to develop improvements in artillery deployment.|$|R

25|$|Apart from {{a control}} that engaged the cam {{follower}} and fired <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> one movement, this gear was based closely {{on the original}} Fokker Stangensteuerung gear.

Wanger was booked and fingerprinted, and {{underwent}} lengthy questioning.|$|E
25|$|The {{layout of}} both Scout and Triplane was {{determined}} {{largely by the}} Admiralty requirement to carry a quick-firing, recoilless Davis gun that used 2lb (1kg) shells. At the time, {{there was no way}} of synchronising such a weapon with the propeller, or of mounting it elsewhere than the fuselage, so a pusher configuration was necessary, the pilot sitting in a nacelle with <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> its nose.|$|E

25|$|Noten's work The Pistol Saints (2003) {{is part of}} the Design Against Crime project.

This inspired him to copy what he called the soul of <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> pieces of jewellery the owner could wear instead of the gun. The Pistol Saints consists of twelve golden brooches with imprints of a gun. On the brooches the gun markings can be clearly distinguished.|$|E

During the Boer advance, Holland kept the Boer soldiers at bay with his carriage mounted Colt machine gun despite the position becoming increasingly dangerous due to the proximity of the enemy.
