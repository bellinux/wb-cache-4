It seems certain that institutions who participate in TARP will have to publicly disclose information pertaining to their participation, including the number of assets they sold to TARP, what <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> were sold, and at what price.

The Quran does not provide specific guidelines on which types of wealth are taxable under the zakat, nor does it specify percentages to be given. But the customary practice is that the amount of zakat paid on capital assets (e.g. money) is 2.5% (1/40). Zakat is additionally payable on agricultural goods, precious metals, minerals, and livestock at a rate varying between 2.5% and 20% (1/5), {{depending on the type of}} goods.|$|E

50|$|The {{extension}} to incomplete markets was first conjectured by Andreu Mas-Colell in 1986. To do this he remarks that Walras' law and Homogeneity of degree zero {{can be understood}} as the fact that the excess demand only depends on the budget set itself. Hence, homogeneity is only saying that excess demand is the same if the budget sets are the same. This formulation extends to incomplete markets. So does Walras law if seen as budget feasibility of excess-demand function. The first incomplete markets Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu type of result was obtained by Jean-Marc Bottazzi and Thorsten Hens (1996). Other works expanded the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> beyond the popular real assets structures like Chiappori and Ekland (1999). All such results are local.|$|E
50|$|When a {{bad bank}} {{has gone through}} its credit {{work-out}} process, {{the remains of the}} bad bank is often asset ownership. Therefore, the bad bank in its life span changes dramatically from being at the outset basically a bank with a large number of loans to later in life a large asset-owning company. A common mistake is to think of this last phase of the bad bank as a kind of investment company. An investment company has very well defined objectives regarding what <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> they want to acquire. They choose the assets they want to acquire. A bad bank gets all the assets that are left after the credit work-out process.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fund manager}} makes a profit in the {{difference}} between the purchase price of the unit or offer price and the sale value of units or the bid price. This difference is known as the bid-offer spread.

The trust deed often gives the manager the right to vary the bid-offer spread to reflect market conditions, with the purpose of allowing the manager to control liquidity. In some jurisdictions the bid-offer spread {{is referred to as the}} [...] "bid-ask spread".|$|E

50|$|In {{a letter}} dated 16 October 2009, Eurostat gave a {{preliminary}} view. The letter stated that NAMA {{is to be}} treated as part of the government sector, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> to be purchased cannot be expanded without approval of the European Commission, that it be a temporary scheme and that the size of potential losses be small relative to the total liabilities. Eurostat noted that the Minister for Finance will examine at the end of 2012 whether NAMA has met its objectives and decide if its continuation is justified. It suggested that a rather detailed analysis has to be carried out, especially of the guarantee arrangements. It made no judgement on the draft NAMA business plan but stated that the presence of market investors is reassuring to it (those providing 51% of the equity in the SPV). Their preliminary conclusion is that the Master SPV may be classified as a financial corporation. However, this is a preliminary view and subject to revision.|$|E

A reverse auction means that bidders (that is, the potential sellers of the troubled assets) will place bids with the Treasury for the right to sell a specified <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets.</b> The sale price will be the lowest price at which the bid will provide the required quantity of the item. Theoretically, the system creates a market price because the bidders will want to sell at the highest price they can get, but they also {{want to be able to}} make a sale, so they must set a low enough price to be competitive. The Treasury is required to publish its methods for pricing, purchasing, and valuing troubled assets no later than two days after the purchase of their first asset.|$|E

40|$|In many {{industrial}} countries, ownership rates <b>of</b> risky <b>assets</b> {{have increased}} {{during the past}} decade. The two main <b>types</b> <b>of</b> risky financial <b>assets</b> held by Dutch private households are mutual funds and stocks of individual firms. We analyze the dynamics of ownerhsip <b>of</b> these two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> risky <b>assets.</b> We use dynamic binary choice panel data models with random effects. Extending existing univariate models to the multivariate case, we take account of interactions between the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets.</b> The models are estimated on data from the 1993 - 1998 waves of the Dutch CentER household survey.

However, the use of customized benchmarks that reflect the specific objectives set by particular funds is increasing.

The outcome tends to be herding and closet index matching. The main alternatives to peer-group benchmarks are: single-index benchmarks with time-varying coefficients, multiple-index benchmarks and fixed benchmarks. The first two alternatives have recently been discussed in the academic literature but have yet to catch on in the practitioner community. There are also benchmarks based on liabilities. These are generally related to real earnings or consumption growth or to the discount rate on liabilities. Explicit liability-based benchmarking is currently not very common, but is likely to become so in the light of both the increasing maturity of pension funds, various regulatory and financial reporting developments, and the Myners Review of Institutional Investment. Liability-driven performance attribution explicitly takes the liabilities into account. Performance benchmarks for institutional investors 109 The US has similar external asset-class and peer-group benchmarks as the UK. Other countries tend to use fixed or bond-based benchmarks. In conclusion, we find that benchmarks are important, but so are fee structures. They can either provide the right incentives for fund managers or they can seriously distort their investment behaviour. 5. ...|$|E
