40|$|<b>Tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> (Spiriva®) {{is used as}} a {{bronchodilator}} {{in chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, clinical evidence suggests that <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> may improve COPD by mechanisms beyond bronchodilation. We hypothesized that <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> may act as an anti-inflammatory agent by inhibiting monocyte chemotaxis, a process that {{plays an important role in}} the lung inflammation of COPD. To test this hypothesis monocytes were pretreated with <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> prior to exposure to chemotactic agents and monocyte chemotactic activity (MCA) was evaluated with a blind chamber technique. <b>Tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> inhibited MCA in a dose- and time- dependent manner (respectively, p< 0. 01) by directly acting on the monocyte. Acetylcholine (ACh) challenge increased MCA (p< 0. 01), and <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> effectively reduced (p< 0. 01) the increase in MCA by ACh. The inhibition of MCA by <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> was reversed by a muscarinic type 3 (M 3) -muscarinic receptor antagonist (p< 0. 01), and was not effected by an M 2 receptor antagonist. Furthermore, a selective M 3 receptor agonist, cevimeline, and Gq protein stimulator, Pasteurella multocida toxin, significantly increased MCA (P < 0. 01), and <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> pretreatment reduced (p< 0. 01) the increase in MCA induced by these agents. These results suggest that tiotropium might regulate monocyte chemotaxis, in part, by interfering with M 3 -muscarinic receptor coupled Gq protein signal transduction.

40|$|In chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) patients <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> {{has been shown}} to improve forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and inspiratory capacity (IC). We investigated whether the mechanism leading to these improvements is related to small airways ventilation heterogeneity, assessed by multiple breath washout tests. Forty stable tiotropium-free COPD patients (FEV 1 : 27 %– 78 % predicted) were studied before and 90 min after administration of <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> on visit 0, and following 3 and 6 weeks of <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> treatment (visit 3 wks, visit 6 wks). After study completion, COPD patients were classified into two subgroups according to degree of hyperinflation at visit 0 (Hyp−, Hyp+). The Hyp+ group showed significant increases in trough (ie, pre-dose) FEV 1 and IC after 3 and 6 weeks of <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> and the 90 min <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> responses of FEV 1 and IC were significant at visit 0 (p ≤ 0. 001 for both) but not during subsequent visits. The Hyp- group showed significant FEV 1 increases 90 min after <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> on all three visits (all p < 0. 005) but no sustained increase in trough values. In both COPD subgroups, the grossly abnormal ventilation heterogeneity barely showed any significant improvements with <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> in the conductive airways (without changes in trough value) and no changes at all in the acinar airways. We conclude that the sustained improvements in trough IC and FEV 1 with <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> predominantly observed in COPD patients with considerable hyperinflation, are unrelated to small airways ventilation heterogeneity...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> (Ba 679 BR) {{is a novel}} potent and {{long-lasting}} muscarinic antagonist {{that has}} been developed {{for the treatment of}} chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD). Binding studies with [3 H]tiotropium bromide in human lung have confirmed that this is a potent muscarinic antagonist with equal affinity for M 1 -, M 2 - and M 3 -receptors and is approximately 10 -fold more potent than ipratropium bromide. <b>Tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> dissociates very slowly from lung muscarinic receptors compared with ipratropium bromide. In vitro <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> has a potent inhibitory effect against cholinergic nerve-induced contraction of guinea-pig and human airways, that has a slower onset than atropine or ipratropium bromide. After washout, however, <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> dissociates extremely slowly compared with the dissociation of atropine and ipratropium bromide. Measurement of acetylcholine (ACh) release from guinea-pig trachea shows that <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> ipratropium bromide and atropine all increase ACh release on neural stimulation and that this effect is washed out equally quickly for the three antagonists. This confirms binding studies to transfected human muscarinic receptors which suggested that <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> dissociates slowly from M 3 -receptors (on airway smooth muscle) but rapidly from M 2 autoreceptors (on cholinergic nerve terminals). Clinical studies with inhaled <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> confirm that it is a potent and long-lasting bronchodilator in COPD and asthma. Furthermore, it protects against cholinergic bronchoconstriction for > 24 h. This suggests that <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> will be a useful bronchodilator, particularly in patients with COPD, and may be suitable for daily dosing.

Although neutrophilic airway inflammation is generally accepted {{to be a major}} factor in the pathogenesis of COPD, the influence of the agents used for the treatment of COPD on neutrophil functions such as chemotaxis is not fully understood. Purpose: The present study aimed to examine the influence of <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> on the production of interleukin (IL) - 8 from human airway epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts (LFs) after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in vitro. Methods: BEAS- 2 B cells, human bronchial epithelial cell line, and LFs, at a concentration of 5 &times; 105 cells/mL, were stimulated with LPS in the presence of various concentrations of <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> IL- 8 in culture supernatants was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). IL- 8 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The influence of <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> on LPS-induced signaling pathways was also analyzed by examining nuclear factor-kappa (NF-&kappa;) B activation and signaling protein phosphorylation by ELISA. Results: <b>Tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> at &gt; 15 pg/mL inhibited IL- 8 production from both BEAS- 2 B cells and LFs after LPS stimulation. <b>Tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> also suppressed IL- 8 mRNA expression through the inhibition of NF-&kappa;B activation and signaling protein, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, phosphorylation. Conclusion: The present results strongly suggest that <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> exerts the inhibitory effect on neutrophilic inflammation through the suppression of IL- 8 production from epithelial cells and LFs by interfering with LPS-mediated signaling pathways and thus may contribute to lower cellular inflammation in COPD, which is responsible for favorable modification of the disease.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{perform a}} pharmacoeconomic {{analysis}} on the treatment of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) with the addition of <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> MethodsPharmacoeconomic modeling was performed utilizing the efficacy of <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> from the literature on different settings and severity of COPD. Reductions in exacerbations, hospitalizations, and number of exacerbation days per year were derived from these studies. Cost of drug treatment, exacerbations, hospitalization, and loss of income were derived from local data in Singapore and reported in Singapore dollars (US$ 1 =S$ 1. 71). A model was constructed to calculate the impact of one-year treatment with <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> and the results were reported for the total incremental cost per year, cost per year needed to reduce one hospitalization in one year, and cost-savings from hospitalizations in one year. Sensitivity analysis were performed for different number of patients treated per year, differing cost of hospitalization, different cost for <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> different impact of <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> on clinical outcomes, and the different amount of substitution drug utilized in the comparator group. ResultsUsing the different clinical effects and looking at the impact on treating 1000, 2000, and 10, 000 patients per year, most of the results showed a high level of decrease in overall cost per year that ranged from S$ 145. 40 to S$ 840. 37 per patient treated. Cost per year needed to reduce one hospitalization in one year ranged from S$ 3217. 31 to S$ 18, 148. 92.

Previously it was shown that anticholinergic drugs reduce the release of non-neuronal paracrine mediators, which modulate inflammation in the airways. On this basis, we investigated the ability of the long-acting anticholinergic <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> to inhibit a) alveolar macrophage (AM) -mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils, and b) cellular release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Method AM and neutrophils were collected from 71 COPD patients. Nanomolar concentrations of <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> were tested in AM cultured up to 20 h with LPS (1 μg/ml). AM supernatant was tested for TNFα, IL 8, IL 6, LTB 4, GM-CSF, MIPα/β and ROS. It was further used in a 96 -well chemotaxis chamber to stimulate the migration of fluorescence labelled neutrophils. Control stimulants consisted of acetylcholine (ACh), carbachol, muscarine or oxotremorine and in part PMA (phorbol myristate acetate, 0. 1 μg/ml). Potential contribution of M 1 - 3 -receptors was ascertained by a) analysis of mRNA transcription by RT-PCR, and b) co-incubation with selective M-receptor inhibitors.

40|$|Chronic {{inflammation}} in {{asthma and}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} drives pathological structural remodelling of the airways. Using <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> acetylcholine was recently identified as playing a major regulatory role in airway smooth muscle remodelling in a guinea pig model of ongoing allergic asthma. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate other aspects of airway remodelling and to compare the effectiveness of tiotropium to the glucocorticosteroid budesonide. Ovalbumin-sensitised guinea pigs were challenged for 12 weeks with aerosolised ovalbumin. The ovalbumin induced airway smooth muscle thickening, hypercontractility of tracheal smooth muscle, increased pulmonary contractile protein (smooth-muscle myosin) abundance, mucous gland hypertrophy, an increase in mucin 5 subtypes A and C (MUC 5 AC) -positive goblet cell numbers and eosinophilia. It was reported previously that treatment with tiotropium inhibits airway smooth muscle thickening and contractile protein expression, and prevents tracheal hypercontractility. This study demonstrates that tiotropium also fully prevented allergen-induced mucous gland hypertrophy, and partially reduced the increase in MUC 5 AC-positive goblet cell numbers and eosinophil infiltration. Treatment with budesonide also prevented airway smooth muscle thickening, contractile protein expression, tracheal hypercontractility and mucous gland hypertrophy, and partially reduced MUC 5 AC-positive goblet cell numbers and eosinophilia.

It represents a growing burden of health care cost, both from societal and economic perspectives. Short- and long-acting bronchodilators remain the mainstay of therapy in COPD patients. New fixed-dose combination inhalers with novel pharmacological combinations of long-acting β 2 -agonists and muscarinic antagonists and delivered once-daily {{through a variety of}} devices are currently being developed and licensed for the treatment of COPD. There is mounting research suggesting that combining a fixed dose of a β 2 -agonist and a muscarinic antagonist achieves better bronchodilation and clinical outcomes compared with either agent alone. These once-daily dosing inhalers are anticipated to impact favorably on patient preference and compliance. This review examines the fixed-dose combination of <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> and olodaterol delivered by a Respimat® Soft Mist™ inhaler at doses of 2. 5 / 5  µg and 5 / 5  µg in moderate-to-very-severe COPD, and its potential role in COPD compared with other long-acting β 2 -agonist with long-acting muscarinic antagonist combinations and delivery devices.

40|$|Bronchoconstriction {{has been}} {{proposed}} to underlie airway remodelling. However, the mechanisms involved are still poorly understood. An important contributor to airway remodelling, in particular airway smooth muscle remodelling is the multifunctional cytokine TGF-β, which can facilitate airway smooth muscle maturation by inducing the expression of contractile proteins. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop an in vitro model which allows investigation of mechanisms involved in the bronchoconstriction-induced airway remodelling. To this aim, precision cut lung slices of guinea pigs were used. Lung slices were viable for at least 2 days. Stimulation with either methacholine or TGF-β 1 augmented the expression of contractile proteins makers including sm-myosin, sm-β-actin and calponin after 2 days. The expression of sm-myosin was particularly enhanced in the peripheral airways (400 μM). Inhibition of actin polymerization by Latrunculin A or of TGF-β receptor kinase by SB 431542 prevented the methacholine effects and the effects of other bronchoconstricting agents including histamine and KCl on contractile protein expression. This indicates the release of biologically active TGF-β in response to bronchoconstriction, ensuing contractile protein expression and thus airway smooth muscle remodelling. The anticholinergic <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> inhibited the methacholineinduced contractile protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Collectively, bronchoconstriction induces the release of biologically active TGF-β and promotes remodelling. Muscarinic receptor induced remodelling can be counteracted by the use of the anticholinergic <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> Precision cut lung slices are a valid in vitro model to study mechanisms involved in airway remodelling induced for example, by bronchoconstriction...|$|E

40|$|Background: Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{respiratory}} disease effecting 24. 6 million children and adults in the United States. Current treatment guidelines recommend the use of inhaled corticosteroids and both short and long acting beta agonists. Several systematic reviews have evaluated the use of anticholinergics with mixed results. <b>Tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> became available in the United States in 2004, yet {{there have been few}} studies utilizing this long acting anticholinergic for the treatment of asthma patients. Purpose: This paper evaluates the current literature on the improvements in pulmonary function in asthmatics with the use of tiotropium in addition to an ICS. GRADE was used to rate the quality of evidence. Method: An exhaustive search of the available literature using Medline, Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Systematic Reviews and CINHAL. The keywords used included “tiotropium”, “asthma” and “adults” individually and in combination. Results: Four articles were found to be relevant to the topic of this paper. Two randomized clinical trials showed statistically improved lung function with the addition of tiotropium to an ICS. One observational study showed that 33 % of patients demonstrated a response of ≥ 15 % improvement in FEV 1 with the addition of tiotropium. A case report also demonstrated improvements in PEF and a decrease in oral steroid use in a chronic asthma patient. Conclusion: <b>Tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> in conjunction with an ICS provides statistically significant improvement in lung function for adult patients with chronic asthma. This conclusion is based on a moderate grade of evidence using the GRADE analysis...|$|E
40|$|Bronchodilators, {{generally}} administered via metered dose or {{dry powder}} inhalers, are the mainstays of pharmacological treatment of stable COPD. Inhaled long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) and anticholinergics are the bronchodilators primarily {{used in the}} chronic treatment of COPD. Anticholinergics act as muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists and are frequently preferred over betaagonists for their minimal cardiac stimulatory effects and greater efficacy in most studies. Their therapeutic efficacy {{is based on the}} fact that vagally mediated bronchoconstriction is the major reversible component of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD. However, bronchodilators are effective only on the reversible component of airflow obstruction, which by definition is limited, as COPD is characterized by a fixed or poorly reversible airflow obstruction. Inhaled anticholinergic antimuscarinic drugs approved for the treatment of COPD include ipratropium bromide, oxitropium bromide and <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> Ipratropium bromide, the prototype of anticholinergic bronchodilators, is a short-acting agent. Oxitropium bromide is administered twice a day. <b>Tiotropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> the only long-acting antimuscarinic agent (LAMA) currently approved, is administered once a day. Newer LAMAs including aclidinium bromide and glycopyrrolate bromide are currently in phase III development for treatment of COPD. Some new LAMAs, including glycocpyrrolate, are suitable for once daily administration and, unlike tiotropium, have a rapid onset of action. New LAMAs and their combination with ultra-LABA and, possibly, inhaled corticosteroids, seem to open new perspectives in the management of COPD. Dualpharmacology muscarinic antagonist-beta 2 agonist (MABA) molecules present a novel approach to the treatment of COPD by combining muscarinic antagonism and beta 2 agonism in a single molecule...|$|E
40|$|Despite current {{guidelines}} {{and the range}} of available treatments, over a half of patients with asthma continue to suffer from poor symptomatic control and remain at risk of future worsening. Although a number of non-pharmacological measures are crucial for good clinical management of asthma, new therapeutic controller medications will have a role in the future management of the disease. Several long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators are under investigation or are available for the treatment of respiratory diseases, including <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> aclidinium bromide, glycopyrronium bromide, glycopyrrolate and umeclidinium bromide, although none is yet licensed for the treatment of asthma. A recent Phase III investigation demonstrated that the once-daily long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> improves lung function and reduces the risk of exacerbation in patients with symptomatic asthma, despite the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta(2) -agonists (LABAs). This has prompted the question of what the rationale is for long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators in asthma. Bronchial smooth muscle contraction is the primary cause of reversible airway narrowing in asthma, and the baseline level of contraction is predominantly set by the level of 'cholinergic tone'. Patients with asthma have increased bronchial smooth muscle tone and mucus hypersecretion, possibly as a result of elevated cholinergic activity, which anticholinergic compounds are known to reduce. Further, anticholinergic compounds may also have anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, evidence suggests that long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators might offer benefits for the maintenance of asthma control, such as in patients failing to gain control on ICS and a LABA, or those with frequent exacerbations...|$|E

40|$|Ching Kuo Tan, Gui Quan Say, James B Geake Department of Respiratory Medicine, Lyell McEwin Hospital, Elizabeth Vale, SA, Australia Abstract: <b>Tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> is a long-acting inhaled muscarinic {{antagonist}} used {{in patients}} with chronic respiratory disease. It has been available since 2002 as a single-dose dry powder formulation via the HandiHaler® dry powder inhaler (DPI) device, and since 2007 as the Respimat® SoftMist™ Inhaler (SMI). The latter is a novel method of medication delivery that utilizes a multidose aqueous solution to deliver the drug as a fine mist. Potential benefits include more efficient drug deposition throughout the respiratory tract, reduced systemic exposure, and greater ease of use and patient satisfaction compared {{with the use of}} HandiHaler DPI. Although <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> delivered via the HandiHaler DPI has been clearly shown to improve lung function, dyspnea, and quality of life and to reduce exacerbations {{in patients with}} chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), there is accumulating evidence regarding the use of tiotropium HandiHaler in other respiratory diseases characterized by airflow limitation, such as asthma and cystic fibrosis. Developed more recently, tiotropium delivered via the Respimat SMI appears to have a similar efficacy and safety profile to the HandiHaler DPI, and early data raising the possibility of safety concerns with its use in COPD have been refuted by more recent evidence. The benefits over the HandiHaler DPI, however, remain unclear. This paper will review the evidence for tiotropium delivered via the Respimat SMI inhaler, in particular {{as an alternative to the}} HandiHaler DPI, and will focus on the safety profile for each of the chronic lung diseases in which it has been trialed, as well as an approach to appropriate patient selection.

40|$|IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Anticholinergic {{agents are}} of {{noteworthy}} {{value in the}} treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but concerns have been raised about a possible association between their use and cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. In this review, we have examined whether and why an anticholinergic agent, and in particular tiotropium, might cause CV risks. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: We first examine the potential pharmacological mechanisms that justify the CV risk with an anticholinergic agent, and then the main clinical trials, observational (cohort or case-control) studies, descriptive reviews and meta-analyses that have looked at the CV risks associated with long-term tiotropium, which are available in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register databases, using the following MeSH, full text and keyword terms: <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> OR Spiriva AND COPD OR chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The almost absolute confidence that there is no real increased risk for death or CV morbidity during treatment with this inhaled anticholinergic agent in patients with COPD because of the results of a large 4 -year trial and a robust and extensive analysis of > 19, 000 patients participating in placebo-controlled tiotropium clinical trials. Nonetheless, because high-risk patients such as those with coronary artery disease, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, hypoxemia requiring daytime oxygen therapy and a creatinine > 2 mg/dl were excluded from Phase III clinical trials, it is impossible to exclude these patients from an increased risk of drug-related cardiac events in a real-world setting. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Despite the recently raised concerns about an excess risk of CV adverse events with inhaled short-acting anticholinergic agents, the risk:benefit ratio of <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> appears still favorable, although it is not known whether high-risk patients are at an increased risk of drug-related CV events...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundInhaled {{bronchodilators}} {{are first}} line {{drugs in the}} treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). <b>Tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> is a recently introduced long-acting anticholinergic agent able to reduce dyspnoea and COPD exacerbations and to improve pulmonary function and quality of life. We designed a study to compare the short-term efficacy of <b>tiotropium</b> <b>bromide</b> with that of oxitropium bromide in improving pulmonary function in patients with COPD. MethodsEighty patients were randomized either to continue oxitropium 800 mcg/day or to receive tiotropium 18 mcg/day. Seventy-six (39 in the tiotropium and 37 in the oxitropium group) completed the study. Plethysmography was performed at baseline and after 72 h in all patients. The changes in functional parameters in the two groups were compared by the Mann–Whitney U-test. ResultsThere were no {{differences between the two groups}} regarding age (72. 5 vs. 74. 2 years), male/female ratio (25 / 14 vs. 23 / 14) and pulmonary function at baseline. The changes in spirometric parameters were significantly greater in tiotropium- than in oxitropium-treated patients: mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) increased significantly by 15 % vs. 3 % (P= 0. 017), mean FVC by 10. 5 % vs. 2. 2 % (P= 0. 044), and FEF 25, 50, and 75 by 34 % vs. 14 % (P< 0. 05), 33 % vs. 7 % (P< 0. 05), and 50 % vs. 6 % (P< 0. 0001), respectively; mean FRC and RV decreased nonsignificantly by 7. 5 % and 10 % with tiotropium vs. 4. 3 % and 6. 5 % with oxitropium, respectively. ConclusionThe replacement of oxitropium with tiotropium significantly increases pulmonary function in patients with COPD. The improvement involves also small airways that have not been investigated thus far...|$|E
