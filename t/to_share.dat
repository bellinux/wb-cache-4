5|$|Although Tito's headquarters, {{along with}} several other Partisan organisations, was {{temporarily}} disrupted and key staff were lost during the operation, all Partisan organisations were quickly re-located and resumed operation.

The operation was a failure, as Tito, his principal headquarters staff and the allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar {{at the time of the}} airborne assault. The operation failed due to a number of factors, including Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar. The failure of the various German intelligence agencies <b>to</b> <b>share</b> the limited intelligence available on Tito's exact location also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans, and this failure <b>to</b> <b>share</b> intelligence was compounded by a lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German airborne force.|$|E
