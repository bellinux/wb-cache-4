5000|$|Gas {{operation}} {{is a system}} of operation used to provide energy to semi-automatic and fully automatic firearms. In gas-operation, a portion of high pressure gas from the cartridge being fired is <b>tapped</b> <b>through</b> a <b>hole</b> in the barrel and diverted to operate the action. There are three basic types: long stroke gas piston (where the gas piston goes the same distance as the operating stroke of the action parts, and is often attached to the action parts), short stroke gas piston (where the gas piston travels a shorter distance than the operating stroke of the action parts), and direct impingement (AKA [...] "direct gas", [...] "gas impingement", {{where there is no}} piston, and the gas acts directly on the action parts). A fourth type, now considered obsolete and ineffective, are those systems based on the Bang rifle that utilize a muzzle cap to capture gas after the bullet has left the barrel. While this system is successful in boosting the operating power of recoil operated guns, it is insufficient and too susceptible to fouling for use as the primary operating system.|$|R

The package allows accurate positioning of beam transport components in areas where liquid lubrication is not possible. The use of hexagonal lattice metals prevents galling or seizing of the rolling surfaces. The actuator translates rotary motion and torque supplied by a commercial radiation-resistant stepping motor into linear motion and force. Two actuators are in operation with a 7. 5 cm output travel. Reproducibility is to-+l step or 0. 0015 cm. The shaft encoder resolves the turns of the motor in 1024 increments with cams and microswitches.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} if copper nanoparticles could be utilized for two types of <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> plating in printed circuit boards, namely: as a catalytic material to initiate the electroless copper deposition process; and as a “conductive” layer which is coherent and conductive enough to allow “direct” electroplating of the <b>through</b> <b>hole.</b> The employment of nanoparticles means that an effective method of dispersion is required and this paper studies the use of mechanical agitation and ultrasound for this purpose. Design/methodology/approach – The paper utilized drilled, copper clad FR 4 laminate. The <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> were functionalized using a commercially available “conditioner” before being immersed in a solution of copper nanoparticles which were dispersed using either a magnetic stirrer or ultrasound (40 kHz). When the copper nanoparticles were utilized as a catalytic material for electroless copper plating, the efficacy of the technique was assessed using a standard “backlight” test which allowed the plating coverage of the <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> to be determined. As a control, a standard palladium catalysed electroless copper process was employed. The morphology of the electroless copper deposits was also analysed using scanning electron microscopy. In the “direct plate” approach, after immersion in the copper nanoparticle dispersion, the <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> were electroplated at 3 [*]Adm− 2 for 15 [*]min, sectioned and examined using an optical microscope. The distance that the copper electroplate had penetrated down the <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> was then determined. Findings – The paper has shown that copper nanoparticles can be used as a catalytic material for electroless copper plating. The coverage of the electroless copper in the <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> improves as the copper nanoparticle concentration increases and, at the highest copper nanoparticle concentrations employed, good, but not complete, electroless copper coverage is obtained. Dispersion of the copper nanoparticles using ultrasound is critical to the process. Ultrasonically dispersed copper nanoparticles achieve some limited success as a conductive layer for “direct” electroplating with some penetration of the electroplated deposit into the <b>through</b> <b>hole.</b> However, if mechanical agitation is employed to mix the nanoparticles, no <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> plating obtaines. Originality/value – The paper has demonstrated the “proof of concept” that copper nanoparticles can be utilized to catalyse the electroless copper process, as well as their potential to replace costly palladium‐based activators. The paper also illustrates the potential for copper nanoparticles to be used as a “direct plate process” and the necessity for using ultrasound for their dispersion in either process...|$|R

40|$|In this report, Silicon wafer based multi-layered {{print circuit}} board is presented. The {{developed}} stacked circuit board {{will lead to}} realization of 3 dimensional MEMS packaging. The <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> and trenches were formed by ICP Si deep etching and the stacked layered structure was prepared with Si fusion bonding of ICP etched wafers. Metal was filled into ICP fabricated <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> and trenches to make electrical feed through. Four Silicon wafers with ICP <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> are aligned and successfully joined by fusion bonding. The target application of this work is multi-layered Silicon based print circuit board. The electrical feed through was fabricated by injecting the Ag (80 wt%) + Cu(20 wt %) mixed with binder, low melting temperature metal, and Ag electrical conductive paste into the small diameter <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> and trenches in oxidized Silicon wafer stacked structure. A multi-component binder system comprising of EVA (Ethylene Vinyl Acetate 35 wt%) + PW (Paraffin Wax 65 wt%) was used. Super critical debinding method is applied prior to final sintering process. The ratio of metal powder and binder was optimized. Low melting point metal and electrical conductive paste filling methods were also tried by injection and vacuum extraction. SEM observation shows that the <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> are filled with metal for a single wafer. However we have still difficulty in filling the metal into four wafers stacked layer.
