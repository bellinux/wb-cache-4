The New Street Gateway Steering Committee, chaired by Mike Whitby, is a committee dedicated to getting the plans to materialise. The council's project manager for Gateway Plus is David Pywell, who was also the Strategic Director of Development for Birmingham City Council before retiring in September 2006. Network Rail announced in 2005 {{that it will be}} setting up an entrepreneurial team <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> with developers and investors working on the project.

25|$|While {{this method}} greatly {{improves}} {{the chances that}} an attack will be successful, it is not without problems. Exploits using this technique still must rely on some amount of luck that they will guess offsets on the stack that are within the NOP-sled region. An incorrect guess will usually result in the target program crashing and could alert the system administrator to the attacker's activities. Another {{problem is that the}} NOP-sled requires a much larger amount of memory in which to hold a NOP-sled large enough to be of any use. This can be a problem when the allocated size of the affected buffer is too small and the current depth of the stack is shallow (i.e. there is not much space {{from the end of the}} current stack frame to the start of the stack). Despite its problems, the NOP-sled is often the only method <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> for a given platform, environment, or situation; as such it is still an important technique.|$|E
500|$|In side plots, Nina has {{recovered}} different translations of the tomes about the First People, including one from William Bell's personal safe, and realizes {{that they all}} {{say the same thing}} in different languages. She identifies the name of the author of each book as an anagram of the name [...] "Sam Weiss", the bowling alley owner who she had directed Olivia to after her initial return from the parallel universe. She approaches Sam, who does not deny he wrote the books, and who explains that the doomsday device being constructed can either create or destroy a universe; how <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> will depend on Peter, who is biologically tuned to the device. Sam posits that Peter will most likely save the universe from which the Olivia he loves originates. The episode ends with Olivia reading the note from Simon, which states that Peter still has feelings for Fauxlivia.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} mixed reviews, {{some critics}} praised [...] "Say You'll Be There" [...] as a catchy song, others dubbed it {{as merely a}} bid for credibility. Dele Fadele of NME {{said that it is}} [...] "another monstrously catchy tune from the fledging pop starlets", and called it [...] "state-of-the-art pop music for '96". Time magazine's Christopher John Farley commented that the song's [...] "groove is penetrating, but the whole thing sounds suspiciously like an Earth, Wind and Fire song that's just on the tip of one's tongue". Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times-Dispatch commented that the song [...] "is a harmless, mid-tempo foot-tapper <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> just fine on Top 40 radio". Edna Gundersen of the USA Today said that Spice [...] "is assembly-line dance-pop", adding that [...] "only the funky 'Say You'll Be There' and touchingly cornball 'Mama' hint at depth". Steve Dollar of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said of the song [...] "it's all pure confection more sugar really than spice", adding that it [...] "even includes a Wonderesque harmonica solo among other obvious sources".|$|E

500|$|Tittle {{threw the}} ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, {{something}} novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness—for which he was frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "Bald Eagle"—he made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that {{he became one of the}} best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. [...] "Tittle has the attitude of a high school kid, with the brain of a computer," [...] said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl two years ago, and I discovered he's quite a guy... He and John, however, are entirely different types... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> on account of something he saw happen on a previous play... The way he puts it, you're convinced it's a good idea and maybe it will work.

Gardner's theory argues that students will be better served by a broader vision of education, wherein teachers use different methodologies, exercises and activities to reach all students, not just those who excel at linguistic and logical intelligence.

2500|$|In March 2008, it was {{reported}} the American network NBC had bought the rights to produce an American remake from Baby Cow Productions. Initial ideas according to Corden were to have Gavin coming from New Jersey and Stacey from South Carolina, meeting up in New York City. In December 2008 however, Jones stated [...] "There was a script written for NBC. They optioned it, but then that went away. I read the script and it wasn't great {{to be honest with}} you.

2500|$|In {{response}} to this apparent [...] "puzzle," [...] Peter D. Feaver laid out an agency theory of civil-military relations, which he argued should replace Huntington's institutional theory. Taking a rationalist approach, he used a principal-agent framework, drawn from microeconomics, to explore how actors in a superior position influence those in a subordinate role. He used the concepts of [...] "working" [...] and [...] "shirking" [...] to explain {{the actions of the}} subordinate. In his construct, the principal is the civilian leadership that has the responsibility of establishing policy. The agent is the military <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> – carry out the designated task – or shirk – evading the principal's wishes and carrying out actions that further the military's own interests. Shirking at its worst may be disobedience, but Feaver includes such things as [...] "foot-dragging" [...] and leaks to the press.|$|E

The attack was credited by the acting chancellor of UCLA as helping to shape the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act. Animal liberation press officer Jerry Vlasak said of the attack: [...] "force is a poor second choice, but if that's the only thing <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> ... there's certainly moral justification for that." [...] As of 2008, activists were increasingly taking protests to the homes of researchers, staging [...] "home demonstrations", which can involve making noise during the night, writing slogans on the researchers' property, smashing windows, and spreading rumors to neighbors.|$|E

Her comments relate to the issues that surround ICANN’s accountability and transparency that have been lacking in its own processes. She notes that the US Exceptionalism should be reconsidered in this regard to protect foreign governments from interfering, and if ICANN is defending its transition based on this principle, thus arguing in another public commentary in that there is [...] "No legal basis for IANA transition" [...] in the post-mortem analysis of the Senate Committee hearing that took place on Feb 25 2015 ...|$|E
2500|$|Special {{effort has}} been made to build {{accessibility}} features into digital projection systems (see digital cinema). Through SMPTE, standards now exist that dictate how open and closed captions, as well as hearing-impaired and visually impaired narrative audio, are packaged {{with the rest of the}} digital movie. This eliminates the proprietary caption distributions required for film, and the associated royalties. SMPTE has also standardized the communication of closed caption content between the digital cinema server and 3rd-party closed caption systems (the CSP/RPL protocol). As a result, new, competitive closed caption systems for digital cinema are now emerging <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> with any standards-compliant digital cinema server. These newer closed caption devices include cupholder-mounted electronic displays and wireless glasses which display caption text in front of the wearer's eyes. [...] Bridge devices are also available to enable the use of Rear Window systems. As of mid-2010, the remaining challenge to the wide introduction of accessibility in digital cinema is the industry-wide transition to SMPTE DCP, the standardized packaging method for very high quality, secure distribution of digital movies.|$|E
2500|$|Vince Aletti from Rolling Stone {{also gave}} an {{unfavorable}} review, stating [...] "the formula is more rigorously locked in than before, {{and the range}} so tightly circumscribed that Houston's potential seems to have shrunk rather than expanded" [...] and the record is [...] "smug, repressive and ridiculously safe." [...] Also, he made some sarcastic comments about the first single, [...] "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)", calling it [...] "How Will I Know II", spoken at Hollywood's blockbuster sequels. Robert Hilburn, in his review for Los Angeles Times, regarded the album as [...] "another commercial blockbuster", writing that the record is [...] "a series of highly accessible selections <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> {{on a variety of}} radio formats." [...] However, he expressed his considerable disappointment that Whitney did precious little to define the singer's vision, adding that she had a sensational voice but didn't assert much vocal character on it. Dolores Barclay of The Associated Press complimented Houston on her vocal ability: [...] "Whitney Houston has a fine instrument and uses it well. Her voice takes us to places we know and to places we might want to forget and to places we dream about." [...] But she, like other critics, was critical of the song material on the record, commenting [...] "There is no depth, and not much excitement. Nor does this talented song stylist and Grammy winner take risks and try something just a little daring." [...] St. Petersburg Times showed a favorable attitude toward her new album at large, stating [...] " [...] is, first and foremost, a product. It has been carefully designed, manufactured and packaged. As such, it's easy to be cynical about. But as products go, this is a pretty good one." [...] They also praised her vocals as follows: [...] "Houston's voice sounds good, real good. [...] She's firmer, more confident." ...|$|E
