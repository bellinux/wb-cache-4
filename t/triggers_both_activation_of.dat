40|$|AbstractThe {{ability of}} {{interleukin}} 2 (IL- 2) to stimulate p 72 syk activity in intact porcine peripheral blood lymphocytes was examined. We demonstrated that IL- 2 activated p 72 syk in a time- and dose-dependent number, for which its peak time and maximum responsive dose were 5 min and 100 U/ml, respectively. This activation was observed only in cytosolic fractions {{and not in}} membrane ones. However, IL- 2 failed to induced calcium mobilization. Moreover, IL- 2 -inducible p 72 syk activation was not affected when extra and intracellular calcium was depleted. These {{data suggest that the}} IL- 2 signaling pathways through p 72 syk in peripheral blood lymphocytes is different, at least in part, from other agonist, such as concanavalin A in polymorphonuclear neutrophils which can <b>trigger</b> <b>both</b> the <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> p 72 syk and intracellular calcium mobilization...|$|R
40|$|The {{intestinal}} epithelium {{regulates the}} transit of molecules from {{and into the}} organism. Several agents act as absorption enhancers inducing changes in both transcellular and paracellular routes. Chitosan is a non-toxic biocompatible polysaccharide widely used as dietary supplement and mucosal delivery. Chitosan <b>triggers</b> <b>both</b> the <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> intestinal epithelial cells {{and the release of}} regulatory factors relevant for its immunomodulatory activity. Yet, the interaction of chitosan with intestinal epithelial cells is poorly characterized. We studied the uptake of this polysaccharide, and we evaluated its effects in both the net water and ion movements across human and rat colon samples and the epithelial permeability. Herein, we demonstrate that chitosan increases the transcellular permeability to ions, water and protein markers in human and rat intestinal mucosa and decreases the water permeability across the paracellular pathway. These findings are relevant to understand the activity of the polysaccharide in the mucosal environment.

To test the hypothesis that tissue factor (TF) plays an integral role in this process, we investigated the expression of TF by human mesothelial cells (HMC) both in vivo and in vitro, and measured the effect of serum on HMC expression of TF in vitro. In vivo TF expression was not detected in HMC of normal pleura, but was detected in HMC of pleura overlying inflamed lung. In vitro, quiescent HMC demonstrated negligible levels of TF expression; however, upon serum stimulation there was a marked induction in both TF protein level and activity, peaking at 8 – 9 h. In contrast, treating quiescent HMC with plasma resulted in a further small, but significant, decrease in TF expression. This serum-induced rise in TF was also reflected in TF mRNA levels and did not require de novo protein synthesis. These results suggest that induction of HMC TF expression may be important in <b>triggering</b> <b>both</b> the intrapleural <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> prothrombin and the deposition of fibrin characteristic of inflammatory effusions.

40|$|Bim is a {{significant}} pro-apoptotic member of Bcl- 2 family of proteins; it is {{proved to be an}} important regulator of apoptosis: over the years it has been shown to play a pivotal role for the development and maintenance of homeostasis in many cellular systems and tissues. The Bcl- 2 family of proteins is a group of key regulators of the mitochondrial, or intrinsic, pathway of apoptosis. It contains anti-apoptotic proteins, which promote cell survival, and pro-apoptotic ones, which induce cell death through the release of apoptotic factors from mitochondria. Proteins of the subfamily of BH- 3 only proteins, which includes Bim, are important regulators of this process. Bim, as well as Bid were shown to bind the majority of anti-apoptotic and proapoptotic Bcl- 2 family members and are believed to induce oligomerization of Bax and Bak proteins, which results in the outer membrane permeabilization and release of pro-apoptotic factors initiating cell death. In spite of its importance for different aspects of T-cell biology, regulation of Bim expression and activity by T-cell receptor (TCR) triggering is poorly understood. The focus of this work was to analyze how different modes of TCR-triggering affect Bim expression in human T-cells at different stages of their differentiation with particular emphasis on effector CD 8 + cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). We showed that expression of Bim is upregulated in activated antigen-specific human CTLs upon polyclonal or specific TCR <b>triggering.</b> <b>Both</b> <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> protein kinase C and induction of calcium influx appear to be necessary and sufficient for Bim upregulation after TCR-ligation. We also showed that Bim expression is differentially regulated by MHC:peptide ligands of different agonistic potency. Ligands which failed to induce Bim expression, failed to induce apoptosis, while induction of Bim accompanied by inefficient upregulation of Bcl-XL was associated with death receptor-independent activation induced cell death (AICD) triggered by partially agonistic ligands in specific CTLs. Cyclosporine A blocked Bim upregulation and rescued CTLs from death receptor independent AICD while rapamycin did not exhibit these activities, in accordance with known effects of the drugs on T-cell deletion in transplant recipients. These results defined a new pathway of Bim regulation, strongly implicated Bim as a mediator of AICD and suggested that Bim upregulation can be targeted to influence the outcome of specific immune responses. We also investigated in more detail the regulation of altered peptide ligands (APL) activity by immunologic help. We analyzed the capacity of exogenous IL- 2 and IL- 15, which are physiologically produced by cells of the adaptive and innate immune system, respectively, to modulate proliferation, responsiveness to repeated stimulation and apoptotic programs triggered in specific CTL by either fully or partially agonistic peptide ligands. We show that signals induced by the lymphokines synergize with weak TCR signaling induced by partially agonistic APL, converting many of these peptides from inhibitory to stimulatory ligands. Some APL partially suppress the responsiveness of specific CTL to secondary stimulation, while this inhibitory effect is diminished if APLstimulated cells are cultured in the presence of either of the lymphokines. We also demonstrate that IL- 2 and IL- 15 suppress up-regulation of Bim and induction of a death receptor-independent apoptotic program triggered by partially agonistic APL. Our results suggest that under conditions of insufficient immunologic help, partially agonistic APL may actively suppress specific CTL responses and become especially advantageous for immune escape of tumors or viruses. We analyzed the expression of Bim in total peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and different subpopulations of ex vivo isolated human T-lymphocytes from healthy donors or patients with infectious mononucleosis. We showed that the majority of freshly isolated PBLs express relatively low levels of Bim, which are not modulated by TCRcrosslinking. However, TCR triggering induced significant Bim upregulation in some PBL samples. Longitudinal analysis demonstrated that responsiveness to TCR triggering, as revealed by Bim upregulation, varies over time in PBLs isolated from the same individual. Memory or naive T-cells enriched on the basis of CD 45 RO or CD 45 RA expression did not differ in their capacity to upregulate Bim in response to receptor crosslinking and were comparable, in this respect, to freshly isolated total lymphocytes. In contrast, lymphocytes isolated from patients with acute stage IM containing characteristic massive expansions of antigenspecific effector CD 8 + T-cells expressed increased levels of Bim, which could not be accounted for by increased proportion of CD 8 + cells. Moreover, lymphocytes from {{at least half of the}} analyzed IM patients exhibited strong upregulation of all major Bim isoforms in response to TCR triggering. These results support the notion that the activity of Bim in human CD 8 + T-cells is regulated at the level of protein expression and the regulation of Bim promoter changes along with the process of Tlymphocyte differentiation enabling them to respond to TCR triggering by Bim upregulation. Our data support an important role of Bim in the regulation of T-cell homeostasis and T-cell mediated immunity and suggest that interference with TCR induced Bim upregulation may affect the outcome of natural immune responses, vaccination, autoimmunity and development of transplant tolerance...|$|R

Sich überlappende synthetische Peptide aus dem Bereich der HBcAg-Bindungsdomäne im C-Terminus der PreS 1 -Region und dem TLM, sind nach Internalisierung vor allem im Kern lokalisiert. Die Aminosäuren 101 - 115 der PreS 1 -Region interagieren mit dem Nukleokapsid, während die PreS 2 -Domäne keine Interaktion mit dem Nukleokapsid eingeht. Mit den synthetischen Peptiden konnte Einfluss auf die Sekretion viraler Partikel genommen werden. Die Lokalisation von HBcAg als Interaktionspartner in HBV-produzierenden Zellen verändert sich bei Inkubation mit den synthetischen Peptiden, es tritt vermehrt im Kern auf. Rekombinante Proteine ähnlich den synthetischen Peptiden aber mit der vollständigen PreS 2 -Region, sind nach Internalisierung im Zytosol nachweisbar. Die Sekretion viraler Partikel wurde partiell inhibiert. Das HBV-Genom kodiert zwei virale Aktivatoren, das HBx und die PreS 2 -Region im LHBs. Beide aktivieren den c-Raf- 1 /MEK-Signalweg. Durch die selektive Inhibierung der Effektoren (Ras oder Proteinkinase C) von HBx oder PreS 2 im LHBs konnte kein Effekt auf die Genexpression/ Sekretion nachgewiesen werden. Durch simultane Inhibierung der Signalkaskade so kommt die Virussekretion fast vollständig zum Erliegen. Die Ursache hierfür ist in einer reduzierten Neusynthese von viralen Proteinen zu finden und nicht in der Akkumulation der Proteine in der Zelle. Zur Untersuchung des Einflusses der Funktionalität der beiden Aktivatoren wurden HBx- bzw. PreS 2 - und HBx/PreS 2 -defiziente HBV-Expressionsplasmide generiert. Die Einzelmutanten zeigten nur einen geringen reduzierenden Einfluss auf die Genexpression/Virussekretion. Beim Einsatz der Doppelmutante wurde die Genexpression/Virussekretion fast vollständig inhibiert. HBx und PreS 2 im LHBs sind für die Virusreplikation von Bedeutung aber sie können einander ersetzen. Assembly of HBV {{particles}} and subsequent secretion of mature virus requires {{the interaction of}} the nucleocapsid with defined domains of the surface proteins. Overlapping synthetic peptides covering the C-terminal part of the PreS 1 domain and the cell permeable domain of PreS 2 (TLM) were shown to localize most of all in the nucleus. Based on these peptides aa 101 - 115 of PreS 1 were found to be essential for the interaction with the nucleocapsid, while the PreS 2 domain does not interact with the nucleus. Presence of the peptides that compete the nucleocapsid surface protein interaction a block of HBV and antigen secretion was achieved. HBcAg as natural interaction partner of the surface proteins then arises increased in the nucleus. Recombinant proteins similar to the synthetic peptides but with the whole PreS 2 domain localize in the cytoplasm and block HBV and antigen secretion. The genome of HBV encodes two transcriptional activators: the HBx protein and the PreS 2 activator LHBs. <b>Both</b> <b>trigger</b> <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> c-Raf- 1 /MEK kinase cascade. To evaluate the importance of both activators for viral replication selective inhibitions of signal transduction cascades were performed and do not result in a decrease of viral replication. Simultaneous inhibition of both activators abolished viral secretion. It is due to a reduced de novo synthesis and not to an accumulation of viral proteins in cells. The relevance of activator function was tested by mutated HBV genome defective for HBx and / or PreS 2 activator function. After transfection single mutants show no significant reduced HBV expression whereas at the double mutated HBV genome a strong reduced virus expression could be observed. The HBx protein and the PreS 2 activator LHBs are important for viral replication but they can replace each other...|$|R

Here we examined the involvement of tyrosine kinases in this pathway in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC 12 cells. Tyrphostin A 25, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked neurite retraction and cell rounding induced by <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> the EP 3 receptor, however, it failed to block neurite retraction and cell rounding induced by microinjection of constitutively active RhoA, RhoAV 14, indicating that a tyrphostin-sensitive tyrosine kinase {{was involved in the}} pathway from the EP 3 receptor to Rho activation. On the other hand, genistein, another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked neurite retraction and cell rounding induced by <b>both</b> <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> the EP 3 receptor and microinjection of RhoAV 14. However, genistein did not block neuronal morphological changes induced by microinjection of a constitutively active mutant of ROKalpha. These results indicate that two different tyrosine kinases, tyrphostin A 25 -sensitive and genistein-sensitive kinases, are involved in the EP 3 receptor-mediated neurite retraction acting upstream and downstream of Rho, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{vascular}} rejection {{represents a}} formidable barrier to clinical xenotransplantation {{and it is}} known that this type of rejection can also be initiated by xenoreactive antibodies that have limited complement-activating ability. Using a sophisticated mouse model, a recent study has provided in vivo evidence for the existence of an IgG(1) -mediated vascular rejection, which uniquely depends on <b>both</b> the <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> complement and interactions with FcgammaRIII on natural killer (NK) cells...|$|R
