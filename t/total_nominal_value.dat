It is an elaborate set of nesting weight pieces, with a total metric weight of 12.238kg. The set is now shown in the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris. The <b>total</b> <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> of the set is 50 marcs de Troyes or marcs de Paris, a mark being 8ounces. The ounce poids de marc had therefore a metric equivalent of 30.59g. The poids de marc was used as a national French standard for trading, for gold, silver and jewels, and for weighing medicine. It was also used in international communications between scientists. In the time before the French Revolution, the civil pound also played the role of the apothecaries' pound in the French apothecaries' system, which otherwise remained a standard system of the Romance (24 grains per scruple) type.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{tolerance}} synthesis, which involves {{the allocation of}} the specified assembly tolerances among the component dimensions of an assembly to ensure a specified yield. Even though the issue of tolerance synthesis has been discussed widely, most research often assumes that component alternatives have equal <b>nominal</b> <b>values.</b> Therefore, the <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> are negligible. However, there may be situations where the <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> are different. In such cases, the <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> should be considered. This paper attempts to include stackup and component <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> to the deterministic tolerance synthesis. The objective {{of this paper is}} to integrate the <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> of aomponent and assemblies within the framework of tolerance synthesis.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the degree}} of competition in the euro area services sector {{and its effects on}} labour productivity and relative prices in that sector over the period 1980 - 2003. The importance of the euro area services sector has significantly increased over time; it now accounts for around 70 % of the euro area’s <b>total</b> <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> added and employment. Labour productivity growth across the euro area services industries appears to be characterised by a high degree of diversity and the level of services inflation is on average higher than aggregate inflation. Investigating several proxies of market competition for the non-financial business services, the paper finds that limited competition in services tends to hamper labour productivity growth in the services sector. Moreover, results tend to suggest that measures aimed at increasing services market competition may have a dampening impact on relative price changes in some services sectors and thus temporarily on aggregate inflation.

40|$|The Law on Extraordinary Loans Amounting to 200 Million Dinars and the Minting of Silver and Nickel Coins in 1916 was {{the legal}} basis for minting the 5 -, 10 -, and 20 -para nickel coins of the Kingdom of Serbia {{featuring}} the year 1917 as their minting year. Some authors {{believe that these}} coins were minted in the Minting House in Paris, whereas the others agree that they were certainly minted in France, but in a still unidentified minting house. There are authors who in recent reference literature underline the possibility of their minting in the USA Gorham Company, in Providence, Rhode Island. These coins had all {{the characteristics of the}} nickel coins of the Kingdom of Serbia from 1883, 1884, 1904 and 1912. Although, according to the Law, the Minister of Finance was authorized to mint 10 million dinars of these nickel coins, only 5 million pieces in each denomination were actually minted, in the <b>total</b> <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> of just 1, 750, 000 dinars. The general opinion is that after the war only a small amount of these nickel coins reached Serbia, because the ships transporting the Serbian coins from the minting house sank on their way. The only varying aspect in this explanation is the location from which the ships were sailing towards Corfu, i. e. from the USA or from France.

These were in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 1, 2, 3 and 5 kopecks in copper; 10, 15, 20 kopecks in base-alloy silver; and 50 kopecks and 1 ruble in silver. Copper coins of the smallest <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> of half kopeck were minted in 1925 - 1928.In 1923, the first Soviet gold coin (1 chervonets in <b>nominal</b> <b>value)</b> was minted. This conformed in all its features to the gold coin worth of 10 rubles of Russian Empire. It almost never appeared in circulation and was only used in foreign trade transactions.Starting from 1926, coins in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 1, 2, 3 and 5 were made of bronze; starting from 1931, coins in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 10, 15 and 20 kopecks were made of cuprum-nickel alloy.There has been a great variety of the first Soviet banknotes. In circulation were the Soviet chervonets (10 rubles) and the rubles designed to portray the symbols of the Soviet ideology. The types of banknotes of this period were often replacing each other.A monetary reform was passed in 1947 with a key objective to promote to a quick recovery of the war-suffered economy, withdrawal of counterfeit money from circulation and replacement of the old samples with new ones.The monetary reform of 1961 was aimed to change the price scale (10:1), improve the money cycle and issue banknotes of new design. New series of coins in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50 kopecks and 1 ruble {{were put into}} circulation. The series of banknotes consisted of 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 rubles in nominal value.In 1991, to regulate the money cycle, banknotes in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 50 and 100 rubles were withdrawn from circulation and substituted by new ones - banknotes of the 1991 series in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 50 and 100 rubles (two different types). Later on, banknotes of the 1991 series in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 1, 3, 5, 10, 200, 500 and 1000 rubles were put into circulation. Since February 1992, prices were liberalized, which led to the rise in prices and devaluation of the ruble.

40|$|Research PaperBefore 1991, the Department of Fisheries was {{the sole}} formal {{fisheries}} management authority in Sierra Leone. This authority's management of the fisheries resulted, however, in less than 10 % of the estimated annual resource rent accruing to government and in increasing the importance of resource over-exploitation. To improve stock conservation and rent collection the fisheries management functions of the marketing of industrial fishing licences, monitoring, control and surveillance were privatised in 1991 to a Joint Venture Company, owned by the Government (51 %) and private investors (49 %). This management experiment, however, collapsed in 1993, and political interference has often been cited as a major contributing factor. This paper {{is part of an}} on-going assessment of the economic efficiency of the fisheries management contract of the Joint Venture Company in order to bring out the importance of this determinant in the demise of the Company and lessons for improving management. Conditions under which efficiency might be improved are also discussed. It mainly relies on the use of estimated indices as proxy for the financial viability of the management contract. Preliminary analysis is indicative of the inefficiency of the contract and enforcement system, despite the improvement in entry control and upward trend in the <b>total</b> <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> of the collected annual access fees. The consequent attempt to adjust the management contract in order to improve its net returns failed, leading to its eventual collapse. The dependence of the fisheries management revenue on multi-factors such as the demand for fishing licences and resource supply suggests the need for the contract to be flexible and profitable...|$|E
