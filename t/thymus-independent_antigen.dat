40|$|The {{effect of}} anti-mu and {{anti-delta}} on the primary in vitro IgM response of murine splenocytes to thymus-dependent (trinitrophenylated erythrocytes) and thymus-independent (trinitrophenylated brucella) forms of trinitrophenyl was studied. The {{results indicate that}} either anti-mu or anti-delta can block the response of adult splenocytes to the thymus-dependent antigen. The thymus-dependent responses of neonatal splenocytes that bear a low concentration of IgD were also abrogated by treatment with anti-delta. In contrast, anti-mu, but not anti-delta, blocked the response of adult splenocytes to the <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigen</b> used. These results indicate that both IgM and IgD are receptors required for triggering cells by a thymus-dependent antigen but that only IgM receptors are required for triggering by the <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigen</b> used...|$|E

40|$|As {{has been}} found for spleen cells from ageing NZB x NZW (B/W) mice, ageing NZB mice were also found to make no {{antibody}} when stimulated in vitro with the polyclonal B cell activators (PBA) LPS and PPD. This immune defect was not due to the action of suppressor cells, since old NZB and B/W spleen cells did not suppress the PBA response of young spleen cells. Spleen cells from aged NZB mice {{were not able to}} generate antibody-forming cells when stimulated with the <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigen,</b> TNP-LPS, but were able to produce antibody in response to another <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigen,</b> TNP-AECM-Ficoll, thereby implying that there is a selective functional deletion of a B cell subpopulation in ageing New Zealand mice. The failure of B/W and NZB spleen cells to generate antibody in response to PBA is interpreted as a consequence of a continuing in vivo polyclonal B cell activation accompanying the development of autoimmune disease, leading to a scarcity of B cells available for activation by PBA and by some thymus-independent antigens in vitro...|$|E

Further, non-adherent spleen-cell and T-cell depleted spleen cells induced in vitro anti-DNP antibody responses to DNP-histone H 1 {{to the same extent}} as normal spleen cells. These results suggest that anti-DNP antibody responses to DNP-histone H 1 are macrophage- and thymus-independent. It was also observed that IgG-type anti-DNP antibodies to DNP-histone H 1 were produced although most <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigens</b> were shown to induce predominantly IgM type antibodies but little, if any, IgG type antibodies.

40|$|The bird's {{antibody}} {{response to}} a thymus-dependent antigen (sheep erythrocytes) (SRBC) and a <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigen</b> (SALMONELLA ADELAIDE O antigen) were characterized: whereas the former proceeded through a brief 19 S {{response to a}} declining 7 S response, the latter failed to switch from 19 S TO 7 S for several weeks and consisted in repeated excursions of 19 S antibodies. When injected intravenously and simultaneously an injection of S. adelaide-killed organisms and SRBC interact, so that {{the response to the}} latter fails to switch from 19 S TO 7 S and consists of repeated excursions of 19 S antibodies. The changed character of the SRBC response is interpreted to be due to the relative lack of 7 S antibody: passive 7 S antibody to S. adelaide O antigen or 7 S anti-SRBC produces a negative feedback inhibition of their respective responses, so that only one excursion of 19 S antibody is observed. The effect is not, however, symmetrical; the <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigen</b> is dominant. Thus, whereas 7 S antibody to S. adelaide produces the same negative feedback inhibition on the response to S. adelaide and the response to SRBC (when injected with adlaide), 7 S antibody to SRBC inhibits only the response to SRBC and not the response to S. adelaide. These results are discussed relation to current hypotheses of antibody biosynthesis and mechanisms of adjuvant action. They are also discussed in relation to the function of the germinal centres of the spleen which may function to mediate the negative feedback of 7 S antibody on the antibody response...|$|E

40|$|The immune {{response}} to most antigens requires cooperation between thymusderived and bone marrow cells (1 - 3).

40|$|Carrageenan, a sulphated polysaccharide, and rabbit anti-mouse {{macrophage}} serum, {{were used}} to inhibit macrophage function in BALB/c mice {{as well as to}} deplete macrophages from spleen cell cultures in an attempt to determine the requirement for macrophages in the immune response to several <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigens.</b> Carrageenan inhibited macrophage function and was cytotoxic at low concentrations. The ability of T and B lymphocytes to undergo mitogen-induced proliferation in the presence of PHA and PLS, respectively, was not affected by in vitro exposure of lymphoid cells to carrageenan. BALB/c mice injected with carrageenan demonstrated a suppressed immune response to SRBC, a thymus-dependent antigen, but not to E. coli LPS, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone or dextran B- 1355 S, all of which are known to be thymus independent antigens. The sensitivity of the in vivo immune response to SRBC after depletion of macrophages by carrageenan treatment was confirmed in vitro using the Marbrook [...] Diener culture system. The in vitro immune response to TNP-LPS was unaffected by either carrageenan treatment or treatment of BALB/c spleen cells with AMS and complement. The results of experiments which utilized the two anti-macrophage reagents, carrageenan and AMS, both in vivo and in vitro systems, suggest that the immune response to <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigens</b> does not require the participation of macrophages...|$|R

It is concluded that HRBC acts in the axolotl as a <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigen.</b> The enhanced response in early as well as in adult thymectomized animals can be interpreted by the presence of a suppressor T-cell activity on anti-HRBC synthesis.

Evidence is presented indicating that both sIgD positive and sIgD negative cells can respond to all types of antigen tested. However, although the presence of sIgD was necessary for the response of sIgD positive cells to thymus-dependent antigens, the presence of this isotype was not obligatory for the response of the sIgD positive population to thymus independent antigens.

40|$|The {{effects of}} mitoclomine, an anti-tumour agent, and of {{cortisone}} acetate on the antibody response of mice to thymus-dependent and <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigens</b> were compared.

Mitoclomine, at low doses, depressed thymus-independent responses the most; this effect can be explained if the drug is more active against B than T cells. Cortisone acetate at low doses, while depressing thymus-dependent responses, increased thymus-independent responses; this can be explained if the drug is more active against T than B cells. Thus three different patterns of immunosuppression (for X-rays, mitoclomine and cortisone acetate) can be interpreted in terms of effects simply on T or B cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary and}} {{secondary}} immune responses to thymus-dependent and -independent antigens were evaluated in normal male and female mice and in castrated male mice. Both IgM antibody production in the primary response and IgG antibody production in the secondary response were enhanced in females vs. males of equivalent age. Castration of the male converted this animal to a female in terms of responsiveness to the thymus-dependent group of antigens, while inducing equivalent or even greater enhanced responsiveness over the female to the <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigen,</b> polyvinylpyrrolidone. Further characteristics {{of the changes in}} lymphoid organs were determined in the castrated animal vs. normal males and females. It was shown that the spleen and thymus became markedly hyperplastic, the organ weights exceeding the female, which in turn were greater than in the male. The enhanced weight of the thymus was shown to be due to increased numbers of cortisone-sensitive cells, the absolute number of cortisone-resistant cells remaining equivalent to normal males and females. Thus, the increased thymic weight of the female also resided in the cortisone-sensitive population. Peripheral lymphocyte counts in castrated animals exceeded both normal males and females. Further experiments in gonadectomized males provided evidence that increased thymic cell activity per se played a role in enhanced response to thymus-dependent antigens, but that a thymic-derived hormone mediated the enhanced effect to the <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigen</b> in the castrated animal. The capacity for loss of androgenic hormone-producing tissue to generate enhanced differentiation of stem cells was denoted by experiments in which numbers of spleen colonies and uptake of 59 Fe, employed as an index of hematopoiesis 1 wk after reconstitution of lethally irradiated castrated and normal recipients, were enhanced in gonadectomized male animals. Thus, in summary, changes in sex hormone levels exerted a marked influence on immune responsiveness and stem cell differentiation, by increasing numbers of functioning cells, by promoting cellular differentiation, as well as by promoting cellular function via hormonal effects...|$|E

Tolerance following 1 mg native levan began to break by 80 days, whereas mice remained specifically unresponsive 150 days after 10 mg. Effects attributable to long persistence of antigen have been demonstrated. The following main features of levan tolerance were established by transfer of spleen cells to 900 R-irradiated recipients: (1) the induction period is very short—less than 24 hours. (2) No detectable immunity accompanies or precedes induction. (3) The fall in immunogenicity with reduction in molecular weight (mol. wt) of levan is not accompanied by loss of tolerogenicity. An effectively tolerogenic, non-immunogenic fraction (mol. wt< 10, 000) was found. (4) There is no rapid loss of tolerance following cell transfer (reactivity is only regained after 50 days), arguing against the existence of tolerant cells in this model...|$|E
40|$|The {{cellular}} {{basis of}} the antibody response to dinitrophenylated levan (DNP-LE) was investigated {{using a combination of}} in vivo and in vitro techniques. The results indicated that the induction of the primary response to DNP-LE is independent of the function of macrophages or T cells. However, these cells may regulate the response to DNP-LE (as for other T-independent antigens), as suggested by the prolongation of the response by adjuvants. No evidence of collaboration between carrier (LE) -reactive and hapten (DNP) -reactive B cells in the induction of the response to DNP-LE was obtained (either by inducing tolerance to LE (in vivo or in vitro) or culturing in the presence of excess LE). Thus DNP-LE, like other <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigens</b> (e. g., DNP-polymerized flagellin, DNP-Ficoll) may trigger B cells directly. © 1975...|$|R
40|$|The lack of {{specific}} T-cell help in immune responses to <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigens</b> results in weak, predominantly immunoglobulin M-mediated immunity {{with little or}} no memory. In the work presented here we show how the exogenous stimulation of CD 40 by monoclonal antibodies can mimic T-cell help, resulting in enhanced immune responses which are protective against bacterial infection. Antigens are classified into three groups: thymus (T) -depen-dent, T-independent type 1 (TI- 1), and TI- 2 antigens. T-de-pendent antigens, including most proteins, induce secondary immune responses characterized by immunoglobulin G (IgG) production due to specific T-cell help. TI antigens, however, lack this specific T-cell help and thus induce weak, predomi-nantly IgM-mediated responses, with an inefficient induction of isotype switching, affinity maturation, and little or no booster effect after the second exposure to the antigen. TI- 1 antigens have inherent mitogenic activity and include bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), whereas TI- 2 antigens such as bac...|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} role of suppressor {{cells in the}} control of the immune response has now been recognized. This phenomenon may soon be considered an essential aspect of immunity. The role of antigen-specific and nonspecific suppressor lymphocytes in the regulation of antibody production has been demonstrated (1).

40|$|Many {{attempts}} have been made to study the induction of specific immunological unresponsiveness in vitro. In general, success has only been achieved with a special class of antigen, the polymeric, multivalent, <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigen,</b> examples of which are lipopolysaccharide (LPS) I from Escherichia coli (1) and polymerized flagellin (POL) (2), or dinitrophenyl (DNP) conjugates of POL (3). Attempts to induce unresponsiveness in dissociated immunocyte populations in vitro, using serum proteins or oligovalent haptenated serum proteins have been unsuccessful (3 - 5). However in instances where lymphoid cells have been treated in vitro and then transferred to irradiated hosts a degree of unresponsiveness has been induced with oligovalent antigens (6), though this form of unresponsiveness has been rather readily reversible (6). In vitro tolerance induction by soluble oligovalent antigens is of considerable interest since such antigens have a greater resemblance to many self-antigens than do the thymus-independent antigens, that are mainly of microbial or artificial origin. Additionally, the mechanism is likely to differ in the case of thymus-dependent and thymus-independent antigens since the latter substance...|$|E
40|$|Antigen-induced {{activation}} of bone marrow-derived (B) lymphocytes involves interactions between specific antigenic determinants and immunoglobulin receptors on the lymphocyte surface (1). Soluble antigens such as serum proteins can trigger B lymphocytes only if thymus-derived (T) cells are provided (2), thus implying {{a requirement for}} some element besides a simple antigen-receptor interaction. Triggering may result from the presentation to the B cell of a multivalent configuration of identical antigenic determinants produced on, or through the action of, the T cell (3, 4). Alternatively, it has been postulated that, {{as well as the}} binding of antigen by receptors, the B cell must react with a second substance, this second signal being some product of collaborating T cells (5). The first hypothesis has been supported by the observation that antigens not requiring T cell help to activate B cells share a common polymeric structure (3, 6), enabling them to directly form multiple receptor-antigen bonds. The experiments to be reported offer an alternative explanation for the role of one such <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigen,</b> polymerized flagellin (POL) (6) in B cell triggering.

The mutually exclusive induction of depolarization in T and B cells by concanavalin A (Con A) ~ and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) respectively, {{and the failure of}} LPS-unresponsive C 3 H/ HeJ B cells exposed to LPS (5) to undergo membrane depolarization suggests that changes in ion flux manifest by decreased membrane potential may be important in mitogenesis. In other somatic cell systems (6 - 9), plasma membrane depolarization has been demonstrated to be important for activation and entry into cell cycle, and has further been postulated to be an initial and critical event in these processes.

40|$|The {{intensity}} of reticuloendothelial blockade by carrageenan, silica and ethyl stearate was measured {{and its effect}} studied on the susceptibility to tolerance induction by polysaccharide antigens in mice. The most intense RE depression reduced the tolerance threshold dose of levan only by 3 -fold and that of dextran B 512 not at all. The genetic resistance of BALB/c mice to tolerization with the alpha 1 - 3 glucose epitope of dextran B 1355 was not overcome by carrageenan blockade which did however, render them normally susceptible to tolerance induction by human gamma-globulin. PFC responses to immunization by the polysaccharides were diminished by blockade, relative to its intensity and to the antigen itself. These and other data suggest that severe RE blockade (a) can promote tolerance by suppressing the active role(s) of the macrophages in immune induction rather than by sustaining circulating antigen, and (b) depresses responses to <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigens,</b> probably by an immunosuppressive influence mediated by damaged macrophages...|$|R
40|$|Many {{features}} of the induction of immunological tolerance are still unclear (for review, see reference 1). The actual mechanism by which immunocompetent cells are made tolerant is unknown. Some studies suggest that tolerance means the killing of imnmnocompetent cells (2 - 4), others that paralyzed cells exist in the organism (5 - 8). The finding of an increased number of antigen-binding cells in animals tolerant to <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigens,</b> such as Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (9, 10) and pneumococcal polysaccharide (11), as compared to normal, unimmunized animals may be interpreted {{as the presence of}} paralyzed cells, in this case with persisting receptors for the antigen. Antigen-binding cells also exist in animals tolerant against thymusdependent antigens, although their number is not increased (12 - 14).

To address the role of CD 40 L in humoral immunity, we created, through homologous recombination, mice deficient in CD 40 L expression. These mice exhibited no gross developmental deficiencies or health abnormalities and contained normal percentages of B and T cell subpopulations. CD 40 L-deficient mice did display selective deficiencies in humoral immunity; basal serum isotype levels were significantly lower than observed in normal mice, and IgE was undetectable. Furthermore, the CD 40 L-deficient mice failed to mount secondary antigen- specific responses to immunization with a thymus-dependent antigen, trinitrophenol-conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (TNP-KLH). By contrast, the CD 40 L-deficient mice produced antigen-specific antibody of all isotypes except IgE {{in response to the}} <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigen,</b> DNP-Ficoll.

However, when the PnC antigen was presented as a complex with TEPC- 15 or McPC- 603 antibodies (which are specific for PnC), a vigorous immune response occurred in which the Tg mice produced 10 - 50 -fold more anti-PnC antibody than when immunized with antigen alone. Interestingly, MOPC- 167, which expresses the VH and VL regions used to encode the transgene antibody, {{was found to be}} a relatively poor 'carrier' for PnC, eliciting a weak anti-PnC antibody response in M 167 (mu, kappa) Tg mice. In vivo administration of anti-CD 4 antibody dramatically reduced the response to TEPC- 15 /PnC complexes, suggesting that the response is mediated by immunoglobulin (idiotype) -dependent helper T cells.

This response was of short duration, and the specific antibodies were rapidly cleared from the circulation. The secondary responses were similar in magnitude, kinetics, IgM predominance, and IgG distribution. Nevertheless, a threefold IgG increase, a correlation between IgM and IgG levels, and dose-dependent secondary responses were observed. Hyperimmunization considerably reinforced these responses: 10 -fold for IgM and 300 -fold for IgG. This favored isotype switch was accompanied by a progressive change in the subclass distribution to IgG 3 (62 %) and IgG 1 (28 %), along with the possible generation of B-cell memory. The results indicate that CpsB is being strictly thymus independent and suggest that unresponsiveness to purified CpsB is due to tolerance...|$|E
40|$|The xid (X-linked immunodeficiency) {{mutation}} in the CBA/N mouse strain {{has been used}} extensively in studies of the functional and lineage relationships of B lymphocyte subpopulations (1 - 7). Defects associated with CBA/N (xid/xid) mice include the inability to respond to some <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigens,</b> hyporesponsiveness to some B cell mitogens and unresponsiveness to others, and inability to produce B lymphocyte colonies in soft agar after mitogen stimulation (8 - 12). These functional defects {{have been associated with}} the absence of at least one subset of mature B cells, first detected in the spleens of normal mice at 2 - 3 wk of age and characterized by expression of Lyb- 5 antigens (12), minor lymphocyte-activating determinants (13, 14), a high concentration of membrane Ig (mIg) 1 S chains and a low concentration of membrane j chains (12, 15). The successful maturation of donor B cells in CBA/N mice given normal B cell progenitors suggests that the defect is intrinsic to affected B cells, rather than humoral or microenvironmental (16). Other subpopulations of m 1 g-bearing B cells and pre-B cells are present i...|$|R
40|$|The CBAJN mouse, a mutant of CBA/H, {{carries an}} X-linked {{recessive}} defect, reflected {{in part by}} its inability to respond to Type III pneumococcal polysaccharide, a ~thymus-independent antigen " (1). This defect has been studied extensively by Scher and his colleagues (2 - 10), who have confirmed that the defective gene is X linked and recessive and have also shown that the defective phenotype is expressed in B lymphocytes. This defective phenotype is associated with two major abnormalities of immune function: (a) inability to produce significant antibody responses to certain <b>thymus-independent</b> <b>antigens</b> (1, 2, 5, 9) and (b) failure to produce at least some sets of high affinity antibodies after immunization with sheep erythrocytes (11). Since all CBA/N T-cell responses which have been examined are normal (3), {{and there is no}} evidence that abnormal suppressor T-cell activity accounts for these defective B-cell responses (2), it has been suggested that these abnormal immune responses reflect a B-cell maturation defect (10). Analyses of the surface properties of CBA/N B cells have indicated that CBAfN B cells (a) fail t...|$|R
40|$|Interaction of the TCR complex with self- {{or foreign}} {{peptides}} {{is a central}} event in the immune responses. Upon TCR stimulation, a protein–tyrosine kinase (PTK), ZAP- 70, is recruited to signaling units of the TCR complex, such as TCRz, to play {{an essential role in}} T cell activation. Here, we find that mice lacking adaptor proteins Dok- 1 and Dok- 2 show augmented responses to thymus-dependent, but not <b>thymus-independent,</b> <b>antigens,</b> and that their T cells show elevated responses to TCR stimulation, including the activation of ZAP- 70 and subsequent proliferation and cytokine production. Furthermore, the forced expression of Dok- 1 or Dok- 2 in a CD 31 CD 41 T cell clone inhibited the activation of ZAP- 70 upon TCR stimulation. Interestingly, the Dok- 1 and Dok- 2 COOH-terminal moieties bearing the src homology 2 target motifs were dispensable for this negative regulation, even though they are crucial for the known adaptor function of Dok-family proteins. Thus, by an as yet unidentified mechanism, Dok- 1 and Dok- 2 play an essential role in the negative regulation of TCR signaling. Consistently, all mice lacking these proteins exhibited elevated titers of antibodies to double-stranded DNA and developed lupus-like renal disease...|$|R
