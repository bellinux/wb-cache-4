5|$|Perry Como {{never forgot}} Canonsburg either. One of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> did {{to give a}} helping hand to his home town was to {{convince}} RCA to open a record-pressing plant there. Those who needed {{to raise funds for}} local projects like Boys' and Girls' Clubs found him always ready to do whatever was needed.|$|E
5|$|Upon Irataba's {{return from}} Washington D.C., {{he met with}} the Mohave while dressed in his major general's uniform, with medals. He wore a European-style hat and carried a long Japanese sword, and he told the Mohave about all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> had seen. He tried to {{convince}} them that peace with the United States was in their best interests, and that war against them was futile, stressing their dominant military capabilities. Many Mohave were skeptical of his reports, and reacted with disbelief.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows a}} tragic course in which Dream, having {{learned a great}} deal from his imprisonment, tries to correct <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> has done wrong in the past. Ultimately, this causes him to mercy kill his own son, which leads to his own death {{at the hands of the}} Furies. Dream, having found himself a {{replacement}} early on in Daniel Hall, dies in issue No. 69 (July 1995). The remaining issues deal with Dream's funeral, Hob Gadling choosing to remain immortal in spite of Dream's death, and two stories from the past. The series wraps with the story of William Shakespeare creating his other commission for Dream, The Tempest, his last work not in collaboration with other writers.|$|E
60|$|To a {{man like}} Paul Déroulède, a man of thought, of purpose, and of action, {{the idea of being}} false to <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> loved, of hate and love being interchangeable, was {{absolutely}} foreign and unbelievable. He had never hated <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> loved or loved <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> hated. A man's feelings in these respects are so much less complex, so much less contradictory.|$|R

Even after the sensational news he had heard inside, the sight {{was something of a}} sensation.|$|R
5|$|Homer {{decides to}} take his family to the new sushi bar, The Happy Sumo. After {{sampling}} most of {{the items on the}} menu, he tries sushi made from fugu. The chef in charge is busy making love with Edna, so his apprentice has to slice the fish, of which certain parts are toxic. He tries to do it carefully, but Homer becomes impatient, only to have it served and become unsure if the poisonous portions have been removed. Homer considers it a treat, but the chef soon returns and believes that the fish has not been prepared correctly and tells Homer that he may have been poisoned. Homer and Marge go to the hospital, where Dr. Hibbert informs Homer that based on a chat he had with the sushi chef, Homer is found out that he has increased likeliness of death and has 22 hours left to live. At night with Marge by his side, he decides not to tell his children about the bad news and makes a list of all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> wants to do before death.|$|E

50|$|The film sparked {{enormous}} controversy {{when first}} aired in 1988, {{in part because}} it conveyed the flat indifference shown by government, society and public to the returning wounded from the Falkands War - this content forms much of the story, as Lawrence struggles {{to come to terms with}} his terrible injuries, and to face a life in which <b>he</b> cannot do <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> is trained to do, <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> loves: soldiering.|$|R

25|$|In 1923 Sundar Singh {{made the}} last of his regular summer visits to Tibet and came back exhausted. His preaching days were {{apparently}} over, and in the next years, in his own home or those of his friends in the Simla hills he gave himself to meditation, fellowship, and writing some of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> had lived to preach.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before his}} inauguration, he had {{traveled}} to Europe to study social democracy and the labor movement, {{and he tried to}} implement <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> had learned there in Mexico.

25|$|Jerry Only and Doyle, meanwhile, {{moved to}} Vernon, New Jersey {{to work at}} their father's machine parts factory full-time.

25|$|Immediately after Thrilla in Manilla, Ali summoned Frazier's son Marvis to his {{dressing}} room and apologized for <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> {{had said about}} Frazier. When Marvis conveyed Ali's contrition to him, Frazier commented that Ali should have communicated this to him directly. After returning to the US, Ali called Butch Lewis, and asked for Frazier's private number, saying he wanted to apologize to Frazier. Lewis then conveyed this request to Frazier, but was told not {{to share it with}} Ali, according to Lewis.|$|E
25|$|Fred Astaire {{performed}} {{dance in}} four ways. He performed romantic ballroom duets, tap duets, solos, and solos with props. He also usually danced with a partner, for example Ginger Rogers. A {{very well known}} duet with Rogers that he did was “Cheek to Cheek” which is a beautiful dance that looks almost like they are gliding across the dance floor together. He didn’t just perform romantic duets with Rogers. He also did many tap duet numbers with her, like the dance “Let Yourself Go” in Follow the Fleet. Astaire’s tap solos, however, {{seemed to be the}} most popular. People were amazed at <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> could dance with while performing. From coat trees to drum sets, Astaire could do it all.|$|E
25|$|In the Millennium special, S.Baldrick {{constructs}} a fake {{time machine}} from Leonardo da Vinci's sketches, despite {{his inability to}} read (combating this with his experience of constructing Airfix models). Baldrick's intelligence has risen {{to the level of}} the second Baldrick again and accidentally makes a real time machine. After a time-travel adventure, Lord Blackadder find England an extension of France, William Shakespeare having designed the ballpoint pen and no knowledge of Robin Hood whatsoever. Edmund takes all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> gained on his journey (besides Elizabeth I's crown) and after another adventure, gets the idea to alter the timeline to become King. Predictably, Baldrick becomes his Prime Minister, finally becoming what he desired (as did Edmund) and is the second Baldrick to rise to upper class (although after Blackadder's alterations there may be more).|$|E

25|$|There were no {{poor people}} {{in the land of}} Oz, because {{there was no such thing}} as money, and all {{property}} of every sort belonged to the Ruler. Each person was given freely by his neighbors whatever he required for his use, which is as much as anyone may reasonably desire. Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play, because it is good to be occupied and to have something to do. There were no cruel overseers set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them. So each one was proud to do all he could for his friends and neighbors, and was glad when they would accept <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> produced.|$|E
25|$|On February 7, 1981, the Beechcraft Bonanza A36TC Wozniak was {{piloting}} crashed {{soon after}} takeoff from the Sky Park Airport in Scotts Valley, California. The plane stalled while climbing, then bounced down the runway, went through two fences, {{and crashed into}} an embankment. Wozniak and his three passengers—then-fiancée Candice Clark, his brother, and his girlfriend—were injured. Wozniak sustained severe face and head injuries, including losing a tooth, and also suffered for five weeks after the crash from anterograde amnesia, the inability to create new memories. He had no memory of the crash, and did not remember {{his name in the}} hospital or <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> did after he was released. He would later state that Apple II computer games are what helped him regain his memory. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation report cited premature liftoff and pilot inexperience as probable causes of the crash.|$|E
