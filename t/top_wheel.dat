50|$|To {{address this}} problem, some {{wheeling}} machines {{have a hand}} adjuster close beneath the anvil yoke (also known a wheel holder) so such panels can curve underneath unobstructed. This type of machine typically has a diagonal lower 'C' shaped frame that curves lower to the floor, with a hand operated adjuster close to the anvil wheel holder, instead of the horizontal and long vertical hand adjuster shown in the above picture. A third type of adjuster moves the <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> {{up and down with}} the bottom anvil wheel left static.|$|E
50|$|The {{depth of}} the C-shaped frame is called the throat. The largest {{machines}} have throat sizes of 120 cm (48 inches), while smaller machines have throat sizes of about 60 cm (24 inches). The C stands vertically and {{is supported by a}} frame. The throat size usually determines the largest size of metal sheet that the operator can place in the machine and work easily. On some machines, the operator can turn the <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> and anvil 90 degrees to the frame to increase the maximum size of the work piece. Because the machine works by an amount of pressure between the wheels through the material, and because that pressure changes as the material becomes thinner, the lower jaw and cradle of the frame that holds the anvil roller is adjustable. It may move with a hydraulic jack on machines designed for steel plate, or a jackscrew on machines designed for sheet metals. As the material thins, the operator must adjust the pressure to compensate.|$|E
5000|$|After the presoak {{application}}, a {{car wash}} tunnel's layout can vary greatly. In some car washes, presoak application {{is followed by}} an empty space, or idle zone. This provides time for the presoak to loosen dirt on the car. In many cases, wheel cleaning equipment, such as sill brushes or high pressure wheel blasters, are placed in the idle zone. A sill brush (also known as a wheel brush or tire brush) consists of an 8-foot-long brush assembly which is pushed against the car's wheels and door sill area. Sill brushes are typically use flagged bristle, as dirt is usually most heavily concentrated on the lower parts of the car. The material on a sill brush may have alternating lengths or use material which is intentionally mounted off-center to allow wheel surfaces of various depths to be cleaned. Sill brushes rely on the rotation of a customer's car's wheels {{in order to achieve}} complete wheel contact. Similarly to the CTAs, wheel brushes often only activate when the customer buys a wheel cleaning upgrade. Some car washes use wheel-rim disc brushes in addition to or in place of sill brushes. These assemblies extend out towards the wheel and follow it at the same speed as the conveyor while rotating at high speeds to clean the wheels. These devices are popular in car washes that use belt conveyors, as a belt conveyor prevents the wheels of a customer's car from rotating and thus renders sill brushes useless for wheel cleaning. Some car washes feature multiple sets of wheel brushes and offer multiple levels of wheel cleaning. Tracking high pressure wheel blasters consist of assemblies with multiple nozzles that follow a car's wheel over a distance. While following a car's wheel, a wheel blaster directs high-pressure water at the wheel. The following motion may be achieved by having the nozzles pivot to face the wheel or by having the nozzles move alongside the car at the same speed as the conveyor. At the end of a car wash's presoak idle zone is often a high pressure arch. High pressure arches direct high pressure water at a vehicle's surface. This may be done [...] "V-jet" [...] nozzles, rotating [...] "turbo" [...] nozzles, spinning manifolds, and oscillating and/or pivoting manifolds. Some high pressure systems maintain a constant distance from the vehicle to provide more consistent results. Separate high pressure <b>top,</b> <b>wheel,</b> and/or side blasters may be present in place of or supplementary to a high pressure arch.|$|E

40|$|The {{responsiveness}} of {{the strain}} system of a bandmill {{is a critical}} factor for bandsaw performance and maintenance. The strain system applies the force, usually through the <b>top</b> <b>wheel,</b> that pulls that blade tight and gives the blade its stiffness. This paper discusses some experimental measurements of {{the movement of the}} <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> during operation, and the implications related to design and maintenance. Strain System Functions The strain system, or <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> assembly, has three functions: 1. Provide enough movement of the <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> to change blades. 2. Apply the strain force to the blade. 3. Allow the <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> to move as the blade length changes. but effectively still maintaining the same strain. Strain, guide position and blade thickness are the threc main factors that affect blade stiffness. The tighter the blade is pulled, the stiffer it will become. Strain also affects the tracking stability of the band on the wheels. The feed force bends the blade back during cutting. causing the band to track backwards. The more the blade bends the faster it moves on the wheels, so increasing th...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Environmental technologyGas hydrate {{formation}} posses {{a notorious}} {{concern for the}} oil and gas industry, and it only gets bigger because of that the never-ending pursuit of oil and gas compels the industry into deeper and colder waters. Here gas hydrate can from and agglomerate into plugs, jeopardizing pipelines and process equipments. Therefore a variety of methods have been developed to inhibit gas hydrate formation, one of them being to utilize low dosage hydrate inhibitors, which consists of kinetic hydrate inhibitors and anti-agglomerants. Low dosage hydrate inhibitors are relatively expensive, and it is therefore important to determine effective concentrations in laboratory apparatuses. Test apparatuses and methods are numerous, and the majority are THF rigs, rocker rigs, autoclaves, pipe wheels and flow loops. Prior methods for assessing hydrate inhibitors performance concentration tend to suffer form not being repeatable in addition to be inconsistent. Thus there are always possible for new hydrate inhibition test methods and apparatuses. A prototype table <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> was developed for testing low dosage hydrate inhibitors. It consisted of a wheel submerged in a water bath. Unique features of the table <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> was its small size, the acrylic top disk and the mode of moving the liquid in the apparatus. A swirling circular motion made the liquid move based on the "Euler disk" mechanical movement, hence no pumps or internal equipment for propelling the liquid was utilized. Preliminary tests were conducted to approve the apparatus for future experimental work, by providing a gas hydrate formation method of a consistent manner. The result for the same anti-agglomerant range in both 1. 5 wt% NaCl solution and distilled water, obtained in the table <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> was compared to the rocker rig RCS 20. This was done to confirm if this apparatus indeed could be used to rank inhibitors, thus a validation of the apparatus. It was confirmed that the table <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> result for the same anti-agglomerant range in both 1. 5 wt% NaCl solution and distilled water had the same trend as the results from the rocker rig. The table <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> was thereby validated and approved at least for this anti-agglomerant range. However, the concentration required for an adequate inhibition was higher in the table <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> compared to the rocker rig, hence the table <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> was a more conservative test apparatus than the rocker rig. Unfortunately the table <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> could not be operated safely after 59 pressurized experiments, due to cracks in the acrylic top disk. This was a severely design flaws which must be sorted out for the apparatus to progress. However, as far as being a prototype the table <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> approved to be adequate. It yielded reliable and predictable test results and provided a consistent method for both hydrate formation and inhibitor testing...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the assessment of an experimental setup for grinding experiments with a <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> speed of 250 m/s. Among other considerations, high speed grinding is widely considered as a way for enhancing material removal rates by utilising large depths of cut and/or high workspeeds. Performing high speed grinding operations, however, presents challenges to the setup due to the high wheel speeds involved. An experimental setup was established in this study for high speed grinding of hardened nodular cast iron and steel using vitrified CBN wheels. This setup was assessed prior to grinding for wheel balancing and guarding, wheel core expansion and temperature rise, grinding fluid delivery, and idle power consumptions. It was found that high speed wheel rotations caused wheel expansion and temperature rise. A significant portion of the total power was consumed on actions other than material removals. The preliminary grinding tests indicated that the setup met the requirements for high speed grinding in general. Copyright 9 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.
