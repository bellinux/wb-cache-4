5|$|In 1942 Oppenheimer {{attempted}} to recruit Rabi and Robert Bacher {{to work at}} the Los Alamos Laboratory on a new secret project. They convinced Oppenheimer that his plan for a military laboratory would not work, since a scientific effort would need to be a civilian affair. The plan was modified, and the new laboratory would be a civilian one, run by the University of California under contract from the War Department. In the end, Rabi still did not go west, but did agree to serve as a consultant to the Manhattan Project. Rabi attended the Trinity test in July 1945. The scientists working on Trinity set up a betting pool on the yield of the test, with predictions ranging from total dud to 45 kilotons of <b>TNT</b> <b>equivalent</b> (kt). Rabi arrived late and found the only entry left was for 18 kilotons, which he purchased. Wearing welding goggles, he waited for the result with Ramsey and Enrico Fermi. The blast was rated at 18.6 kilotons, and Rabi won the pool.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{number of}} {{explosive}} attacks on civilian buildings has recently increased and {{the pattern of}} damage inflicted on structures when an explosion takes place at altitude remains quite difficult to predict. The primary aim of the work reported here was to enhance the understanding of how blast waves from an explosion at altitude interact with the ground and with a structure. Small-scale experiments were conducted using a propane-oxygen stoichiometric mixture as explosive. This approach is original because it models high-explosive detonation in terms of gaseous charge explosion using <b>TNT</b> <b>equivalents.</b> Several non-dimensional laws are expressed and validated by experiments. These relationships allow determination of the propagation of a blast wave and its interaction with a structure {{as a function of}} the position of the explosive charge when the explosion occurs at altitude. Then, from knowledge of the blast loading, using Hopkinson's scaling law and <b>TNT</b> <b>equivalents,</b> we can predict the interaction of blast waves with the ground and a structure on a real scale. Simulations were performed using the Autodyn code, and good correlation with the experimental results was obtained...|$|R
50|$|The SI unit {{of energy}} is the joule. Assuming that a TNT {{explosion}} releases 1,000 small (thermochemical) calories per gram (4.2 kJ/g), one tonne of <b>TNT</b> is <b>equivalent</b> to 4.2 gigajoules.|$|R
2500|$|The {{devices were}} boosted fission weapons using {{military-grade}} plutonium, yielding 60.1% {{of the first}} tests performed two days earlier. The Theoretical Physics Group (TPG) calculated that the blast yield was 20kt of <b>TNT</b> <b>equivalent.</b> Although the American Physical Society estimated the yield at [...] based on data received by their computer, Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan confirmed the TPG blast calculations {{in an interview in}} 1998.|$|E
2500|$|One {{particularly}} dangerous warhead was Livermore's W47, {{designed for}} the Polaris submarine missile. The last test before the 1958 moratorium was a one-point test of the W47 primary, which had an unacceptably high nuclear yield of [...] of <b>TNT</b> <b>equivalent</b> (Hardtack II Titania). With the test moratorium in force, {{there was no way}} to refine the design and make it inherently one-point safe. Los Alamos had a suitable primary that was one-point safe, but rather than share with Los Alamos the credit for designing the first SLBM warhead, Livermore chose to use mechanical safing on its own inherently unsafe primary. The result was a safety scheme consisting of a boron-coated wire inserted into the hollow pit at manufacture. The warhead was armed by withdrawing the wire onto a spool driven by an electric motor. Once withdrawn, the wire could not be re-inserted. [...] The wire had a tendency to become brittle during storage, and break or get stuck during arming, preventing complete removal and rendering the warhead a dud. It was estimated that 50-75% of warheads would fail. This required a complete rebuild of the W47 primaries. The oil used for lubricating the wire also promoted corrosion of the pit.|$|E
50|$|A <b>TNT</b> <b>equivalent</b> is {{a measure}} of energy {{released}} in the detonation of trinitrotoluene. A tonne of <b>TNT</b> <b>equivalent</b> is approximately 4.184 gigajoules or 1,163 kilowatt hours.|$|E
50|$|Strategic {{nuclear weapons}} are used {{primarily}} {{as part of a}} doctrine of deterrence by threatening large targets, such as cities. Weapons meant for use in limited military maneuvers, such as destroying specific military, communications, or infrastructure targets, are known as tactical nuclear weapons. In terms of explosive yields, nowadays the former have much larger yield than the latter, even though it is not a rule. The bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 (with <b>TNT</b> <b>equivalents</b> between 15 and 22 kilotons) were weaker than many of today's tactical weapons, yet they achieved the desired effect when used strategically.|$|R
40|$|The Quantity Distance Measurement Tool is a GIS BASEP {{computer}} program that aids safety engineers by calculating quantity-distance (Q-D) relationships for vessels that contain explosive chemicals used in testing rocket engines. (Q-D relationships are standard relationships between specified quantities of specified explosive materials and minimum distances {{by which they}} must be separated from persons, objects, and other explosives to obtain specified types and degrees of protection.) The program uses customized geographic-information-system (GIS) software and calculates Q-D relationships in accordance with NASA's Safety Standard For Explosives, Propellants, and Pyrotechnics. Displays generated by the program enable the identification of hazards, showing the relationships of propellant-storage-vessel safety buffers to inhabited facilities and public roads. Current Q-D information is calculated and maintained in graphical form for all vessels that contain propellants or other chemicals, the explosiveness of which is expressed in <b>TNT</b> <b>equivalents</b> [amounts of trinitrotoluene (<b>TNT)</b> having <b>equivalent</b> explosive effects].

40|$|International audienceSeveral {{formulations}} {{have been}} published to define the characteristic parameters of an incident blast wave. In almost all previous work, the charge examined has been TNT explosive and overpressure has been the main parameter examined. In this paper, we describe an investigation based on three explosives, TNT, PETN and ANFO, which has been conducted by considering three parameters: overpressure, duration and impulse of the positive blast wave phase. Calculations of the three parameters were conducted using TM 5 - 855 through the tool CONWEP and AUTODYN. The positive overpressures were calculated using the new forensic software ASIDE. The evolution of these blast wave parameters is expressed by combining the laws of two approaches: the forensic approach and the security approach. <b>TNT</b> <b>equivalents</b> are {{expressed in terms of}} pressure and impulse for the comparisons of ANFO and PETN...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{explosion}} of {{liquid carbon dioxide}} tanks are extremely rare in the world, {{this article describes the}} 125 m 3 liquid carbon dioxide tank explosion that happened on a ship. This paper gives a comprehensive analysis and calculation on the explosion energy and hazard radius as well as the causes of the accident, with the explosion energy being converted to <b>TNT</b> <b>equivalents.</b> Tank explosion radiuses leading to death, serious injury and different degrees of destructions are also obtained via theoretic calculation. According to the calculation, this article points out that the direct cause of explosion is that the designer confuses the concept of " Low-temperature vessels " with the concept of " Low-temperature and Low-vessels Low Stress vessels". The reasons of the tank explosion accident are not only the mistaken design but also the operating violation. Finally the article also makes a reflection from four different perspectives...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Avalanche hazard {{mitigation}} programs routinely use explosive {{charges to}} release ava-lanches and test slope stability, but fundamental understanding of snowpack response to explosive deto-nations is lacking. This project, conducted in southwest Montana, aimed to verify past findings and further {{develop an understanding}} of snow explosive interactions, particularly for hard slab conditions. Past re-search collected dynamic snow responses 10 - 100 m from the detonation site while the current study placed an instrumentation suite within 3 - 5 m of the detonation. Pentolite cast boosters (0. 9 kg) were deto-nated from 0. 0 m to 2. 0 m above the hard slab snow surface. An array of six orthogonally paired accel-erometers, inserted into the snowpack at three different depths at two locations from the blast, recorded snow accelerations. High pressure sensors, located at and above the snow surface, measured air over-pressures. Distances, radial and horizontal, from the explosives and charge height were scaled to <b>TNT</b> <b>equivalents</b> to aid in explosive placement comparisons. A substantial advantage was recorded in maxi-mum snow accelerations due to elevating the explosive. Vertical and radial attenuation functions within the snowpack were determined from accelerometer data. Using the attention functions, predictions for depth and range of affected snow were developed. While the depth of affected snow did not increase substantially with a raised explosive, the range did show significant increases yielding an 80 - 100 % in-crease in the volume of snow impacted by the explosive. The data also demonstrated that there was vir-tually no penalty in shockwave attenuation from raising the explosive...|$|R

40|$|Between June 1946 and October 1958, Enewetak and Bikini Atolls {{were used}} by the United States as testing grounds for 66 nuclear devices. The {{combined}} explosive yield from these tests was 107 Mt (Mt <b>TNT</b> <b>equivalents).</b> This testing produced close-in fallout debris that was contaminated with quantities of radioactive fission and particle activated products, and unspent radioactive nuclear fuel that entered the aquatic environment of the atolls. Today, the sediments in the lagoons are reservoirs for 10 's of TBq of the transuranics and some long-lived fission and activation products. The larger amounts of contamination are associated with fine and coarse sediment material adjacent to {{the locations of the}} high yield explosions. Radionuclides are also distributed vertically in the sediment column to various depths in all regions of the lagoons. Concentrations greater than fallout background levels are found in filtered water sampled over several decades from all locations and depths in the lagoons. This is a direct indication that the radionuclides are continuously mobilized to solution from the solid phases. Of particular importance {{is the fact that the}} long-lived radionuclides are accumulated to different levels by indigenous aquatic plants and organisms that are used as food by resident people. One might anticipate finding continuous high contamination levels in many of the edible marine organisms from the lagoons, since the radionuclides associated with the sediments are not contained and are available to the different organisms in a relatively shallow water environment. This is not the case. We estimate that the radiological dose from consumption of the edible parts of marine foods at Enewetak and Bikini is presently about 0. 05 % of the total 50 -year integral effective dose from all other exposure pathways that include ingestion of terrestrial foods and drinking water, external exposure and inhalation.
