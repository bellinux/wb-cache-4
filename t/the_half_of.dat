5|$|The lack of {{decisive action}} on the Virginia Peninsula spurred President Abraham Lincoln to order McClellan's army to move into {{positions}} close to Richmond. By May30, McClellan had begun moving troops across the Chickahominy River, the only major natural barrier that separated his army from Richmond. However, heavy rains and thunderstorms {{on the night of}} May30 caused the water level to swell, washing away two bridges and splitting the Federal army in two across the Chickahominy. In the subsequent Battle of Seven Pines, Confederate general-in-chief Joseph E. Johnston sought to capitalize on the bifurcation of McClellan's army, attacking <b>the</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the Union Army that was stuck south of the river. Johnston's plan fell apart, and McClellan lost no ground. Late in the battle, Johnston was hit in the right shoulder by a bullet and in the chest by a shell fragment; his command went to Maj. Gen. Gustavus W. Smith. Smith's tenure as commander of the Army of Northern Virginia was short. On June1, after an unsuccessful attack on Union forces, Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederacy, appointed Robert E. Lee, his own military adviser, to replace Smith as the commander-in-chief of the Confederate armies.|$|E

40|$|Interpretation of freeze-fracture and thin-section results {{shows that}} fusion of the {{peripheral}} vesicle with the plasmalemma of a Phytophthora palmivora zoospore occurs at several discrete sites {{and results in}} the formation and expansion of a particle-free bilayer membrane diaphragm and in {{the appearance of a}} polymorphic network of membrane-bounded tunnels, the lumina of which are continuous with the cytoplasm. <b>The</b> outer <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bilayer membrane diaphragm appears continuous with <b>the</b> outer <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plasma membrane; <b>the</b> inner <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bilayer membrane diaphragm with <b>the</b> inner <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peripheral vesicle membrane; and <b>the</b> inner <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plasmalemma with <b>the</b> outer <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peripheral vesicle membrane. Interpretation of our results leads us to formulate a hypothesis for a sequence of several intermediate stages involved in membrane fusion. The initial fusion event is viewed as a local catastrophe (Thom, R. 1972. Stabilite Structurelle et Morphogenese. W. A. Benjamin Inc., Reading, Mass.) involving the sudden reorganization of apposed elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plasmalemma and <b>the</b> outer <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peripheral vesicle membrane. Fusion of apposed components at the rim of the perimeter of fusion results in the formation of a toroid hemi-micelle which provides continuity between <b>the</b> inner <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plasmalemma and <b>the</b> outer <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peripheral vesicle membrane. Simultaneously, apposed components at the site of fusion may reorganize into an inverted membrane micelle. A bilayer membrane diaphragm is then formed by apposition and flowing of components form <b>the</b> outer <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plasmalemma and <b>the</b> inner (exoplasmic) <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peripheral vesicle membrane. The existence of large areas of membrane contact before fusion may lead to several fusion events and the formation of a polymorphic network of membrane- bound tunnels...|$|R
