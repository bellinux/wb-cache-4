As a discriminant analysis is easily modeled with a bayesian network, we will show that we we can consider the multivariate T² and MEWMA control charts as particular cases of the discriminant analysis. So, we give the structure of the bayesian network as well as the parameters of the network in order to detect faults in the multivariate space in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>manners</b> <b>as</b> if we used multivariate control charts.

5|$|Approximately 1 {{percent of}} tornadoes rotate in an {{anticyclonic}} {{direction in the}} northern hemisphere. Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending rear flank downdraft (RFD) in a cyclonic supercell. On rare occasions, anticyclonic tornadoes form {{in association with the}} mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> <b>as</b> the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.|$|E
5|$|As a Postelsia alga grows, its stipe thickens in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> <b>as</b> a tree's trunk. The cells {{beneath the}} epidermis, called the meristoderm, divide rapidly to form rings of growth, again, like a tree. However, the greater {{flexibility}} of Postelsia stipe over {{that of a}} woody tree makes for some distinct differences. Postelsia must be thicker than a tree of equal height {{in order to support}} itself. However, the stipe is very much more suited to the coastal habitat, as it allows the seaweed to bend with the constant wave action. Such an environment would cause the inflexible, woody tree to break.|$|E

5|$|Gimsa et al. (2015) {{suggest that}} the dorsal sail of Spinosaurus was {{homologous}} to the dorsal fins of sailfish and served a hydrodynamic purpose. Gimsa and others point out that more basal, long-legged spinosaurids have otherwise round or crescent-shaped dorsal sails, whereas in Spinosaurus, the dorsal neural spines form a shape that is roughly rectangular and similar in shape to the dorsal fins of sailfish. They therefore argue that Spinosaurus used its dorsal neural sail in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> <b>as</b> sailfish, and that it also employed its long narrow tail to stun prey like a modern thresher shark.|$|E
