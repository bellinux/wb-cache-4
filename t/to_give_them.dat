5|$|Chromium oxides {{are also}} used as a green color in glassmaking and as a glaze in ceramics. Green {{chromium}} oxide is extremely light-fast and as such is used in cladding coatings. It is also the main ingredient in infrared reflecting paints, used by the armed forces, to paint vehicles, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> the same IR reflectance as green leaves.|$|E
5|$|Pedro Orozco, {{the leader}} of the Sacatepéquez Mam of San Marcos department, lent willing help to the Dominicans in their {{campaign}} to peacefully subject the inhabitants of Verapaz. On 1 May 1543 Carlos V rewarded the Sacatepéquez Mam by issuing a royal order promising never <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> in encomienda.|$|E

5|$|The British Empire had {{received}} the Christmas present the Prime Minister had wanted <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them,</b> along with the moral prestige of effecting a Christian occupation of Jerusalem. It was a huge blow to the Ottoman Empire, which had suffered the loss of yet another Muslim Holy Place (having already lost Mecca and Baghdad).|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the murders, the Ministry of Interior {{announced}} its deliberation about making the gun license registry accessible to psychiatrists in order <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> the ability to report to police possible changes of mental state of their patients having an impact on their eligibility to possess firearms. This was, however, rejected by psychiatric associations. They argued that psychiatrists' main goal is to cure patients, and that potential patients {{may be more likely to}} avoid psychiatric treatment for fear of losing their gun license.|$|E
5|$|After {{purchasing}} a drum set and acquiring a piano from Joey's mother, Jimmy secures {{the remainder of}} the band's musical equipment from Duffy, a black market dealer. The band rehearses on the second floor above a snooker hall, and after much practice, they convince a local church community centre <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a gig, under the pretence of it being an anti-heroin campaign. Jimmy then hires Mickah Wallace, a hot-tempered bouncer, to act as the band's security. The band draws a good crowd, but after Deco inadvertently hits Derek with his microphone stand, the amplifiers explode, resulting in a power outage.|$|E

6000|$|... "I suppose we'd have <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>'em</b> regular {{soldiers}} fare," [...] was Andy's dry comment. [...] "Salt pork and baked beans {{and things like}} that," [...] and he grinned.|$|R
5|$|After {{their first}} {{victory of the}} season, the Flyers were {{challenged}} by the Muncie Offers More AC. The game was labelled as the Muncie City Championship. Since {{most of the other}} local teams' seasons were finished, both Muncie teams hired as many as 20 players for the game. The field was muddy, which caused Offers More AC to fumble the ball several times. In the third quarter, the Flyers scored two touchdowns <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a 14–0 lead going into the fourth quarter. The Flyers added 10 more points—a touchdown and a field goal—in the final quarter to win the Championship 24–0.|$|E
5|$|As Melbourne was {{the only}} ship of her size (both in {{dimensions}} and ship's company) in the RAN, the carrier underwent a regular rotation of commanding officers <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> experience. Commanding officers were changed on average every fifteen months, with few remaining on board {{for more than two}} years. The majority of Melbournes commanders later reached flag rank. The carrier was also called on to perform underway replenishments and command and control functions.|$|E
5|$|Damon hit a {{home run}} to right field in the first at-bat of the game on a 2-1 count to give the Red Sox the lead in the first inning for the fourth {{straight}} game; it proved to be the game-winning run. Ramírez singled in the third inning to give him a hit in 17consecutive postseason games. Doubles by David Ortiz to right and Trot Nixon to center, who narrowly missed a grand slam after swinging on a 3-0 count, scored two more runs for the Red Sox <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a three-run lead.|$|E

5|$|Ernuszt and {{his younger}} brother, John Ernuszt, made several {{attempts}} to regain the estates that Matthias Corvinus had confiscated from their father in the early 1470s. They persuaded him <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> their father's former copper mines at Besztercebánya (now Banská Bystrica in Slovakia) in 1494. Soon after, they leased the mines to John and George Thurzó for 10 years. They also regained Szklabonya (Sklabiná in Slovakia) from Anton Poki, a retainer of John Corvinus. The Ernuszt brothers, who held more than 3,500 peasant households, were among the wealthiest landowners in Hungary in 1494.|$|E
5|$|Heskey {{suffered}} a suspected broken metatarsal in September 2007, {{and made his}} return for Wigan in a 2–0 defeat to Arsenal in November. He picked up an ankle injury during Wigan's 5–3 victory against Blackburn in December 2007. On 14 April 2008, Heskey scored a 90th minute equalising goal against Chelsea, which damaged their hopes of winning the Premier League. He went on to score Wigan's equaliser against Tottenham in the following match <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a 1–1 draw, which proved to be his last goal of 2007–08, which he finished with 4 goals in 30 appearances.|$|E
5|$|In the 11th century, William the Conqueror {{brought the}} Talbot hound to Britain. The Talbot was a {{predominantly}} white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound {{derived from the}} St. Hubert Hound which had been developed in the 8th century. At some point the English Talbots were crossed with Greyhounds <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> an extra turn of speed. Long extinct, the Talbot strain probably {{gave rise to the}} Southern Hound which, in turn, is thought to be an ancestor of the modern-day beagle.|$|E

5000|$|It was an {{open door}} to the abuse of authority; it {{required}} that the parties in question {{could be said to}} have acted independently, which in the end was tantamount <b>to</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> license <b>to</b> act independently.|$|R
5|$|In {{the third}} act, Jekyll's servant, Poole, gives Dr. Lanyon a powder and liquid with {{instructions}} from Jekyll <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> {{to a person}} who will request them. While he waits, Lanyon speaks with Newcome, Rebecca, Agnes and Mrs. Lanyon. After the others leave, Hyde arrives for the powder and liquid. After arguing with Lanyon, he mixes them into a potion and drinks it; he immediately transforms into Jekyll.|$|E
5|$|In {{their meeting}} against the North Texas Mean Green, Alabama outgained their {{opponent}} 586 to 169 yards of total offense in Alabama's 41–0 victory. After a 26-yard Jeremy Shelley field goal gave the Crimson Tide a 3–0 lead, Trent Richardson scored their first touchdown {{of the evening}} on Alabama's second offensive possession <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a 10–0 lead {{at the end of}} the first period. The Crimson Tide extended their lead to 20–0 by halftime after a 43-yard Eddie Lacy touchdown run and a 37-yard Shelley field goal in the second quarter.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is perpetually {{covered with}} clouds {{composed}} of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds {{are located in}} the tropopause and are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued zones and darker belts. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. Wind speeds of 100m/s (360km/h) are common in zonal jets. The zones have been observed to vary in width, color and intensity from year to year, but they have remained sufficiently stable for scientists <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> identifying designations.|$|E

5|$|Lake Waiau {{provided}} {{drinking water}} for the workers. Native chiefs would also dip the umbilical cords of newborn babies in its water, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> {{the strength of the}} mountain. Use of the quarry declined between this period and contact with Americans and Europeans. As part of the ritual associated with quarrying, the workers erected shrines to their gods; these and other quarry artifacts remain at the sites, most of which lie within what is now the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{she lets}} them outside again, but this time, Russetfur walks in on them.

Later on, Sasha goes out hunting and the kits go out to find Ken {{because they want to}} make their mother happy.|$|E
5|$|Nomura {{said that}} Spira {{deviates}} from {{the worlds of}} past Final Fantasy games most notably {{in the level of}} detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have made a conscious effort to maintain during the design process. Fumi Nakashima, the sub-character chief designer, concentrated on giving characters from different regions and cultures distinct styles of clothing. Nakashima wanted the machine-oriented society of the Al Bhed to stand out and had them wear masks and goggles <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a strange and eccentric appearance.|$|E
