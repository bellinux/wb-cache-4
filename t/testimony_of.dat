5|$|In Hindu philosophy, yoga is {{the name}} of one of the six {{orthodox}} (which accept the <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> Vedas) philosophical schools. Karel Werner, author of Yoga And Indian Philosophy, believes that the process of systematization of yoga which began in the middle and Yoga Upanishads culminated with the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.|$|E

5|$|A few sculptures, {{including}} Epimetheus and Pandora, {{have been}} attributed to El Greco. This doubtful attribution is based on the <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> Pacheco (he saw in El Greco's studio a series of figurines, but these may have been merely models). There are also four drawings among the surviving works of El Greco; three of them are preparatory works for the altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo and the fourth is a study for one of his paintings, The Crucifixion.|$|E
5|$|A {{fragment}} {{of the film}} footage of the demolition was discovered five decades later by the film director Lordan Zafranović during research for his 1993 documentary feature, Decline of the Century: <b>Testimony</b> <b>of</b> L. Z.; 41 seconds of the film survives. This footage was also shown in Mira Wolf's documentary, The Zagreb Synagogue 1867-1942 (1996), produced by Croatian Radiotelevision.|$|E
5|$|Chairman Joseph S. Clark {{suggested}} that the subcommittee travel to Mississippi to verify Wright's <b>testimony.</b> <b>Of</b> the subcommittee's nine members, Senators Robert F. Kennedy, Jacob Javits, George Murphy agreed to the idea and accompanied him. Kennedy dispatched his aide Peter Edelman to get an advanced view on the situation. Edelman spoke extensively with Wright, whom he would marry 15 months later.|$|E

5|$|Defense {{accounts}} contradicted the <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> Behan, Claiborne and Allen, who {{all said}} that a man had fired a nickel-plated pistol first. Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun. (Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the film, Spielberg founded the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, a nonprofit {{organization}} with the goal of providing an archive for the filmed <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> as many survivors of the Holocaust as possible, to save their stories. He continues to finance that work. Spielberg used proceeds from the film to finance several related documentaries, including Anne Frank Remembered (1995), The Lost Children of Berlin (1996), and The Last Days (1998).|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>{{testimony}}</b> <b>of</b> Seymour, Power, and Williams, {{it became}} clear the jury could not convict Williams based on witness testimony alone. There was, however, some circumstantial evidence: an empty holster found by the police among Williams' possessions showed evidence of a revolver recently being inside it. The police enlisted the aid of {{an expert in the}} new science of forensic ballistics, Robert Churchill; {{it was one of the}} first times the police made use of ballistics in a case.|$|E

5|$|In {{the later}} {{days of the}} trial, Quisling's health suffered, {{largely as a result}} of the number of medical tests to which he was subjected, and his defence faltered. The prosecution's {{powerful}} final speech placed responsibility for the Final Solution being carried out in Norway at the feet of Quisling, using the <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> German officials. The prosecutor Annæus Schjødt called for the death penalty, using laws introduced by the government-in-exile in October 1941 and January 1942.|$|E
5|$|Leslie was a Confederate sympathizer {{during the}} Civil War, but began {{to adopt a}} more {{progressive}} position during his gubernatorial campaign against Harlan. Though he opposed ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, he used his influence as governor to effect passage of laws admitting the <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> blacks in court and providing for an educational system for recently freed slaves. He also helped quell violence perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan {{in many areas of}} the state.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other matters}} were also raised, {{relating}} to particular {{parts of the}} evidence (specifically, relating to the witness <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> Yahya Goba, one of the Buffalo Six), but these matters had little bearing on the final outcome of the case, and were dealt with only briefly by the court. The central argument raised was that, with regard to all the circumstances, Thomas did not actually have a practical choice whether to speak or not.|$|E

5|$|Six months later, {{a second}} trial {{took place in}} Orlando for the {{abduction}} and murder of Kimberly Leach. Bundy was found guilty once again, after less than eight hours' deliberation, due principally to the <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> an eyewitness who saw him leading Leach from the schoolyard to his stolen van. Important material evidence included clothing fibers with an unusual manufacturing error, found in the van and on Leach's body, which matched fibers from the jacket Bundy was wearing when he was arrested.|$|E
5|$|Taylor v. Illinois, , is a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} {{in which the}} Court held that defense witnesses can be prevented from testifying under certain circumstances, even if that hurts the defense's case. Taylor was the first case to hold {{that there is no}} absolute bar to blocking the <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> a surprise witness, even if that is an essential witness for the defendant, a limitation of the broad right to present a defense recognized in Washington v. Texas.|$|E
5|$|The seven-week trial {{included}} the <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> 366 witnesses. All {{of the defendants}} were found guilty on June 30. Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt were sentenced to death by hanging; Samuel Mudd, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlen were {{sentenced to life in}} prison. Edmund Spangler was sentenced to six years. After sentencing Mary Surratt to hang, five jurors signed a letter recommending clemency, but Johnson refused to stop the execution; he later claimed he never saw the letter.|$|E
