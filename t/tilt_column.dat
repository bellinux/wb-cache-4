A systematic study of the mechanical properties is carried out by comparing the hardness and the Young's modulus determined by nanoindentation for thin films prepared at different deposition angles and characterized by a tilted nanocolumnar structure and others where the nanocolumns are perpendicular to the substrate or are arranged as zig-zag stacked layers.

Differences in the results are discussed {{in view of the}} cross section images obtained by focused ion beam and of the deformed areas.

At tilt α = 1.0 ^∘, the errors have changed very little compared to the untilted crystal, though {{the appearance of the}} image have changed in the central part of particle, this is due to an effective diminishing of the projected potential, as have been reported elsewhere [49]. The errors stay small up to a tilt α = 2.0 ^∘, but increase sharply in the centre of the nanoparticle between α = 2.0 ^∘ and α = 3.0 ^∘. The error introduced by tilt is very dependent on the height of the atomic columns, since the length of the footprint of the projection of a <b>tilted</b> <b>column</b> increases linearly with its height.

40|$|Zonal {{flows in}} rapidly-rotating {{celestial}} {{objects such as}} the Sun, gas or ice giants form {{in a variety of}} surface patterns and amplitudes. Whereas the differential rotation on the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn features a super-rotating equatorial region, the ice giants, Neptune and Uranus harbour an equatorial jet slower than the planetary rotation. Global numerical models covering the optically thick, deep-reaching and rapidly rotating convective envelopes of gas giants reproduce successfully the prograde jet at the equator. In such models, convective columns shaped by the dominant Coriolis force typically exhibit a consistent prograde tilt. Hence angular momentum is pumped away from the rotation axis via Reynolds stresses. Those models are found to be strongly geostrophic, hence a modulation of the zonal flow structure along the axis of rotation, e. g. introduced by persistent latitudinal temperature gradients, seems of minor importance. Within our study we stimulate these thermal gradients and the resulting ageostrophic flows by applying an axisymmetric and equatorially symmetric outer boundary heat flux anomaly (Y_ 20) with variable amplitude and sign. Such a forcing pattern mimics the thermal effect of intense solar or stellar irradiation. Our results suggest that the ageostrophic flows are linearly amplified with the forcing amplitude q^ leading to a more pronounced dimple of the equatorial jet (alike Jupiter). The geostrophic flow contributions, however, are suppressed for weak q^, but inverted and re-amplified once q^ exceeds a critical value. The inverse geostrophic differential rotation is consistently maintained by now also inversely <b>tilted</b> <b>columns</b> and reminiscent of zonal flow profiles observed for the ice giants.

Generally these compounds have flat or nearly flat cores and surrounded by four to eight long chain substituents. A vast majority of these compounds exhibit the columnar mesophase. This phase {{is characterized by a}} structure in which the disc shaped molecules are stacked {{one on top of the}} other to form columns, the different columns constituting a two-dimensional lattice. Several variants of the columnar structure have been identified–upright <b>columns,</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>columns,</b> hexagonal lattice, rectangular lattice, etc. The stacking of the discs within the column could be on the one extreme, liquid-like or on the other have a true long range order. Although X-ray measurements on quite a few compounds exhibiting these different structures have been reported, the temperature dependence of the various structural parameters does not seem to have received much attention. We have used an image plate detector to carry out detailed X-ray studies of several compounds exhibiting the columnar phase. Analysis of the X-ray patterns yields, apart from information on the structural symmetry in terms of the planar space groups, quantitative data on (i) the ordering of the chains and the cores of the mesogens, (ii) the core-core correlation length along the column axis and (iii) the intercolumnar spacing. In particular, it is seen that the extent of ordering of the discs within the columns has significant temperature dependence. Data collected as a function of temperature will be presented and questions regarding ordering within the columns addressed, particularly in two compounds, one of which exhibits a columnar to a plastic phase transition and the other, a columnar to a helical phase transition...|$|R

We discuss four different materials: 1) <b>Tilted</b> <b>columns</b> of aluminum-oxide 2) Gold particles in aluminum-oxide 3) Cadmium sulpho-selenide particles in aluminum-oxide 4) Silver particles in zinc-sulphide. We begin {{with a description of}} the vacuum system and some the techniques used to characterize the optical and structural properties of the films. This leads to our study of second-harmonic generation (SHG) in aluminum-oxide thin films deposited at an angle to the evaporant source. We show that SHG is very sensitive to the non-isotropic microstructure that results from such a deposition. and the behavior of the SHG signal with sample orientation provides insight to the symmetry properties of the microstructure. In a related study we show that AU/Al₂O₃ composite films produce a large SHG signal. We investigate the dependence of the strength of the SHG signal with fill-fraction of gold and show that it increases quadratically. in agreement with theory. The third material we discuss is cadmium sulpho-selenide doped aluminumoxide. We describe attempts at nucleating semiconductor crystallites in a variety of hosts through a process of co-deposition and subsequent annealing. We also deposit alternate layers of CdS-Se and Al₂O₃ with the semiconductor layer thin enough that interspersed crystallites form. This results in suspended. isolated crystallites similar to the doped-glass materials of interest to nonlinear optics. A waveguide of a CdS/Al₂O₃ "sandwich" demonstrates optical nonlinearity through a power-dependent prism coupling experiment, and the degree of nonlinearity is much greater than undoped glass, though less than doped glass. The final section of the dissertation is a theoretical description of nonlinear optical behavior in a novel composite material consisting of metal particles in a nonlinear dielectric host. We assume the enhanced field around the resonating particles drives the host locally nonlinear through either a Kerr-type or thermal nonlinearity. We calculate the change in optical properties of the medium due to this effect and show that for a system of silver in zinc-sulphide the nonlinearity can be significant...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanics}} of room-temperature creep fracture on the nanoscale was evaluated on Ti oblique nanocolumns grown on a Si substrate using glancing angle deposition. An experimental method for the nanocolumn arrays using a micro-brick specimen (2 μm high and 2 μm wide) {{was used for}} the creep experiments. To clarify whether the nanoscale stress concentration dominated the creep fracture, two types of specimens were prepared: a forward specimen (loading with the <b>column</b> <b>tilt</b> direction) and a reverse specimen (loading against the <b>column</b> <b>tilt</b> direction), where the reverse specimen had a higher stress singularity at the interface edge than the forward specimen. The Ti nanocolumns deformed in a time-dependent manner under a constant applied force and then fractured at the interface. The forward specimens required a higher applied force than the reverse specimens for a similar fracture life. The local stress distribution along the Ti/Si interface during the creep experiments was analyzed using finite element method. The Mises stresses near the edge in the region of about 5 nm were very close in forward and reverse specimens with similar fracture lives. This suggested that the local stress field in the nanoscale region dominated the creep fracture. In addition, the room temperature creep of the nanocolumns greatly accelerated in comparison with their bulk counterparts...|$|R
