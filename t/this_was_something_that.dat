5|$|The bill {{received}} Royal Assent on 13 August 1888 with Hanley listed {{among those}} places {{to be granted}} county borough status. The corporation of Hanley vacillated for several months as to how best to proceed, then in February 1889 opted for Hanley to take its county borough status, effectively killing both the county proposal and the county borough proposal. Why Hanley corporation made such a decision is not recorded, but it {{was reported in the}} Staffordshire Sentinel of 5 February 1901 that it was because Stoke Corporation insisted that the administrative centre of the new county be in Stoke, not Hanley, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> Hanley could not agree too.|$|E
25|$|This was no fashionable affectation; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> belonged at {{the heart}} of what it was to be Dorian, and {{therefore}} Macedonian, and had more in common with the Theban Sacred Band than with Athens.

25|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to make accurate generalizations about reverse imagery, as <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> varied by emperor, some trends do exist. An example is reverse types of the military emperors {{during the second half of}} the third century, where virtually all of the types were the common and standard personifications and deities. A possible explanation for the lack of originality is that these emperors were attempting to present conservative images to establish their legitimacy, something that many of these emperors lacked. Although these emperors relied on traditional reverse types, their portraits often emphasized their authority through stern gazes, and even featured the bust of the emperor clad in armor.|$|E

Maslen is godfather to Womack's two {{children}} and she is godmother to Maslen's son, Zak. They often go on holiday together with their children, which Womack revealed during an appearance on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross in January 2008. In late 2007 Maslen joined the cast of EastEnders as Jack Branning, who has a relationship with Womack's character, Ronnie. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> both Maslen and Womack were initially uncomfortable with when they read the scripts, with Maslen commenting in various interviews that having to kiss Womack was like having to kiss his sister.|$|E
25|$|With stylometric {{approaches}} it {{is possible}} to identify certain characteristics which are very typical of Shakespeare, {{such as the use of}} particular poetic techniques or the frequency with which various common words are used, and these have been used to argue that Marlowe could not have written Shakespeare's works. In every case so far where these data have been plotted over time, however, Marlowe's corpus has been found to fit just where Shakespeare's would have been, had he written anything before the early 1590s as all of Marlowe's were. On the other hand, whereas stylometry might be useful in discerning where two sets of work are not by the same person, it can be used with less confidence to show that they are. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> T.C. Mendenhall, whose work some Marlovians have nevertheless thought proves their theory, was at pains to point out.|$|E
25|$|Ancient sources mention {{what brought}} Pompey into the alliance, but are silent on what {{interests}} might have brought Crassus into the fold. There are only mentions of Caesar bringing Pompey and Crassus together, which Plutarch {{described as a}} reconciliation. Cassius Dio thought that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> required skill—almost {{as if it were}} a reconciliation of the irreconcilable. In the writings of Suetonius and Plutarch and in some letters and a speech of Cicero, we find clues about both what the interests of Crassus may have been, and indications that Crassus and Pompey might have been less irreconcilable that their portrayals suggest and that the three men of the triumvirate had collaborated before. It could be argued that the formation of the first triumvirate was the result of the marginalisation of an enemy (Caesar) and an outsider (Pompey) and the rebuttal of interests associated with Crassus by the optimates who held sway in the senate.|$|E

25|$|The {{legislative}} act {{was the result}} of a great deal of negotiation between Waterloo College, Waterloo College Associated Faculties, and St. Jerome's College, another denominational college in the City of Waterloo. While the agreements sought to safeguard the existence of the two denominational colleges, they also aimed at federating them with the newly established University of Waterloo. Due to disagreements with Waterloo College, the College was not formally federated with the new university. The dispute centred on a controversially worded section of the University of Waterloo Act, 1959, in which the College interpreted certain sections as a guarantee that it would become the Faculty of Art for the new university. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> the Associated Faculties was not prepared to accept. As a result of the controversy, Waterloo College's entire Department of Mathematics broke away from the College to join the newly established University of Waterloo, later joined by professors from the Economic, German, Modern Languages, and Russian departments. Despite this controversy, until 1960 Hagey hoped that a last-minute compromise between Waterloo College and the University could be achieved. Ultimately, however, the University created its own Faculty of Arts in 1960. It later established the first Faculty of Mathematics in North America on 1 January 1967. In 1967, the world's first department of kinesiology was created. The present {{legislative act}} which defines how the university should be governed, the University of Waterloo Act, 1972 was passed on 10 May 1972.|$|E
25|$|The SDS June 1969 Convention is best {{described}} as a clash between three major factions of the organization: the Revolutionary Youth Movement (RYM), the Worker Student Alliance (WSA) {{also known as the}} Progressive Labor Party (PL), and the Revolutionary Youth Movement II (RYM II). The three factions could be described with PL on one end, RYM on the other, and RYM II somewhere in between the two. PL (aka WSA) took a very strictly traditional Maoist-Marxist line. Lead by communist Jeff Gordon, PL saw themselves separate of the counterculture, and did not “smoke dope or wear their hair long”. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> RYM and RYM II disliked about the Maoist faction; the fact that SDS was of and for the counterculture was one of its most distinguishing traits, thus the two other factions felt that PL was disrespecting this feature of the college-based organization. WSA “saw race as divisive and promoted a staid and conservative view of the working class”. They did not back African-American nationalism as the RYMs did, and described their purpose as class struggle, appealing to the working class proletariat of America. PL’s platform centered around “the old left notion that black nationalism was a diversion from the all-important class struggle”. This was a stark contrast from RYM, who saw America’s faults in terms of race and imperialism. PL vied for control of SDS in order to expel these other schools of thought and bring in the working-classes of America. However, their conflict with RYM and RYM II at the convention was both poorly timed and not enough to size full control.|$|E
500|$|In most ways Mosney was {{identical}} to the existing successful camps, but in Ireland <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was seen to be feared, rather than embraced. A number of complaints appeared in the Catholic Standard, warning that holiday camps were an English idea that was not desirable in Catholic Ireland. Like the other camps, Mosney was designed [...] to have a church and reassurances were given {{that it would be}} a Catholic chapel with a resident priest. Reassurances were also given that Irish nationals would have priority over British tourists in booking holidays. In July 1948 the camp was finally opened by William Norton, the Minister for Social Welfare, and it operated successfully as a Butlin's camp until the early 1980s.|$|E

500|$|Purnell was {{the first}} proponent {{of the idea that}} two atomic attacks, one {{following}} quickly after the other, would be required to end the war. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> Groves and Purnell discussed a number of times. [...] "I knew that with him and Farrell on the ground at Tinian," [...] Groves wrote. [...] "There would be no unnecessary delay in exploiting our success" [...] after the bombing of Hiroshima. The main difficulty with the second mission, then scheduled for 11 August, was the weather, which was predicted to be good until 9 August but bad for at least five days starting on 10 August. Parsons agreed to work the assembly team around the clock to get the Fat Man bomb ready by the evening of 8 August.|$|E
500|$|Gitter {{played the}} album for other Roadrunner {{employees}} and stated [...] "The feeling was <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> touched upon classic metal, pulls it up through hardcore, and creates something fairly new and completely exciting. When their music started circulating around the office, {{there was an}} immediate 'Holy... this is great!' feeling about it. People weren't halfway about it." [...] Gitter offered to sign the band to the label and felt that signing Killswitch Engage was the label's last chance to have any heavy metal bands on the roster. The band was apprehensive at first, judging by the artist roster of Roadrunner at the time, but after nearly six months of deliberation, Killswitch Engage signed to Roadrunner due to the opportunities it provided for them. After signing, the band began work on their major label debut, which would become Alive or Just Breathing. Gitter has claimed that signing Killswitch Engage was the most gratifying signing of his career.|$|E
500|$|The {{birth of}} the Federation was first hinted at during part two of [...] "Shockwave", which opened the second season. When Manny Coto was made show runner for the fourth season, he decided that {{the focus of the}} series should be to link to that event. With this in mind, his {{intention}} was for this season to move towards that goal. Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens were hired as writers on Enterprise because they wrote the non-canon novel Federation and after it was suggested by producer Mike Sussman. The episodes for the fourth season were intended to lay the framework for the later creation of the Federation. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> the cast said that they would have liked to see more of, with Scott Bakula later saying [...] "I {{would have loved to have}} been able to explore that journey to the Federation and their creation of it... to a greater extent. And I think that would have been, um, just more fun for the audience... just better, longer storytelling." ...|$|E

500|$|Rathborne {{chose to}} open the episode with a shot {{centered}} on Sherilyn Fenn, finding the actress to be [...] "seductive" [...] and [...] "absorbing" [...] {{in a similar manner}} to screen icon Marilyn Monroe. Rathborne had initially worried that the episode featured too many static scenes of characters sitting and talking, with little action, and asked Lynch if she could borrow some of the imagery of the previous episode's surreal dream sequence to keep these conversations more interesting, adding brief snippets of footage as Cooper discussed the dream with the others. Rathborne has noted that this dream-centric approach to the character of Cooper is rooted in Carl Jung's theories of analytical psychology. She felt <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> had not been seen on television before, and credits Lynch with introducing it to the series. She has also described the narrative, both of [...] "Episode 3" [...] and of Twin Peaks as a whole, as a [...] "Bildungsroman" [...] showing Cooper's development into a more rounded and enlightened person.|$|E
