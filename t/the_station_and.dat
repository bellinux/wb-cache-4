5|$|After {{operating}} {{only during}} peak hours {{for more than}} 30years, the closure announcement came on 4 January 1993. The original 1907 lifts required replacement {{at a cost of}} £3million. This was not considered justifiable in relation to the passenger numbers using <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>and</b> it was losing London Regional Transport £150,000 per year. The Secretary of State for Transport granted permission on 1 September 1994 to close <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>and</b> the branch closed on 30 September. Recognising the station's historical significance as a mostly unaltered station from the early 20th century, the station was given Grade II listed building status in 2011.|$|E

5|$|After {{a lengthy}} public {{debate over whether}} to place the station to the east or west of the Wallkill River, {{it was built in}} 1870 on the east bank, within the village of New Paltz. The rail line was {{formally}} opened during a large ceremony on December20, 1870. A decade later the station had become a popular departure point for the Mohonk Mountain House by many vacationers, including two U.S. presidents. In the late 19th century, over a dozen stagecoaches ran between <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>and</b> Mohonk daily.|$|E
5|$|After {{operating}} {{only during}} peak hours {{for more than}} 30years, the closure announcement came on 4 January 1993. The original 1907 lifts at Aldwych required replacement {{at a cost of}} £3million. This was not justifiable as only 450 passengers used the station each day and it was losing London Regional Transport £150,000 per year. The Secretary of State for Transport granted permission on 1 September 1994 to close <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>and</b> the branch closed on 30 September.|$|E

5|$|An Italian officer entered <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> <b>and</b> {{informed}} {{the medical staff}} they were now prisoners of war. But since they were treating casualties from both sides, {{they were allowed to}} remain and continue operating. Treatment of the wounded continued all day, and by 22:00 the surgeons had carried out 21 surgical operations and were looking after 62 British and 29 German or Italian patients. At 18:30, in the darkness, Lathbury led the remainder of his men to join the 2nd Parachute Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Angel's former {{superiors}} beg him {{to return}} to London, as the crime rate has risen in his absence, but Angel remains in Sandford. As the officers process the paperwork, Tom Weaver, the last NWA member, attempts to kill Angel. Danny takes a bullet for Angel, and in the process Weaver accidentally activates the confiscated naval mine, destroying <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>and</b> killing him. One year later, Angel and Danny are in charge of the Sandford Police as Inspector and Sergeant, respectively.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} project, parking {{capacity}} at {{the transit}} center would be reduced by spaces eliminated for <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>and</b> a new bus station {{to the west of}} the current one.

30|$|The sensitivities of <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> <b>and</b> their {{positions}} {{are such that}} every station can receive signals from all sources. Consequently—unlike {{in the case of}} wireless agent localization—the measurements consist only of direct distance measurements between <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sources. This generally reduces error propagation during localization and simplifies the problem formulation, as out-of-range agents {{do not need to be}} considered.|$|R
5|$|Beacon Hill {{station is}} also served by three bus routes {{operated}} by King County Metro that use bus stops {{adjacent to the}} station: Route 36, an electric trolleybus route, runs along Beacon Avenue from Othello station to the International District and Downtown; Route 60 runs between West Seattle, Georgetown, Beacon Hill, First Hill and Capitol Hill; and Route 107, which terminates at <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>and</b> travels southeasterly to Georgetown, Rainier Beach station, Skyway and Renton.|$|E
5|$|Berg {{station has}} seen many {{accidents}} and almost-accidents. In 1965, a deadly accident occurred between Ullevål and Berg stations, when a train ran over a 33-year-old man {{walking in the}} tracks. In 2002, a 24-year-old man was {{run over by a}} metro train approaching the station. The man survived the accident with minor wounds. In 2008, a 21-year-old drunk man was found crawling around on the tracks between the platforms. The police removed him from <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>and</b> sent him home in a taxi.|$|E
5|$|By 1870, a track {{had been}} added to the east of <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>and</b> two sidings {{had been added}} to the west; one of the western sidings was a bay {{platform}} for passenger trains, which was accessed from the platform adjoining the upper floor.

5|$|Construction of {{the light}} rail {{extension}} began in 2012 and will be completed in 2021. Construction on the station began in 2016 and will be completed in 2020; a $174 million contract was awarded to Absher Construction in August 2016 to build <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>and</b> approaching elevated guideway. On January 13, 2017, Sound Transit broke ground on the station, beginning construction with the demolition of two parking lots.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the station}} started in 1918 and was {{finished}} in 1921. The station, excluding its water tower and restaurant, cost 117,062 Norwegian krone (NOK) to build and took 26,883 man-hours. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> <b>and</b> axillary buildings were designed by Gudmund Hoel of NSB Arkitektkontor. The station opened with {{the first part of}} the Rauma Line on 19 November 1921. It remained the terminus until 25 November 1923, when the next section, to Verma Station, opened.|$|E
5|$|Disused {{parts of}} <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>and</b> the running tunnels were used during both world wars to shelter artworks from London's public {{galleries}} and museums from bombing.

5|$|However, after further consideration, the Coast Guard {{announced}} in April 2013 {{that the museum}} was to be located at Union Station. The main portion of the museum is to be located east of the tracks, with a new 500-passenger ferry terminal likely integrated into the four-story, 54,300-square-foot glass-faced building.

5|$|In 2506, {{during the}} End War, the Daelaam {{under the command}} of Hierarch Artanis came to Cybros to reactivate the purifiers. Clolarion acted as their {{spokesman}} and leader during the mission, and ordered the Purifiers to engage the zerg on <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> <b>and</b> then purified the surface of Endion, the forest moon Cybros orbited. With the battle over, Artanis asked the purifiers to join the Daelaam in the war against Amon. Clolarion questioned his sincerity and only accepted an alliance on the condition of Talandar being their ambassador.|$|E
5|$|In November 2015, King County Metro {{agreed to}} sell Convention Place station to the Washington State Convention Center in a $147 million deal.
