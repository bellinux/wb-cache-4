50|$|On {{the basis}} of {{experience}} during World War I, the Admiralty instituted trade convoys in United Kingdom coastal waters from September 1939. Anti-submarine escorts were allocated on {{the basis of}} perceived threat. Early German Type II submarines from bases in Germany were unable to operate effectively beyond European coastal waters. Following acquisition of bases in Norway and France, German Type IX submarines and German Type VII submarines refuelled by German Type XIV submarines operated in the mid-Atlantic beyond the range of patrolling aircraft. Many anti-submarine escorts lacked the endurance to accompany convoys through the mid-Atlantic. HX 129 left Halifax on 27 May 1941 as the first convoy <b>to</b> receive <b>escort</b> for the entire trip. Escorts based in Halifax Harbour handed HX 129 off <b>to</b> <b>escorts</b> based in Newfoundland who subsequently transferred HX 129 <b>to</b> <b>escorts</b> based in Iceland who in turn delivered HX 129 <b>to</b> <b>escorts</b> based in the Western Approaches.|$|R
