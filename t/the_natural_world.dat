5|$|Although Massachusetts was {{the first}} slave-holding colony {{dating back to the}} early 1600s, in the years leading up to the American Civil War, Massachusetts was a center of progressivist and {{abolitionist}} activity. Horace Mann made the state's school system a national model. Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson made major contributions to American philosophy. Members of the transcendentalist movement emphasized the importance of <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world</b> and emotion to humanity.|$|E
50|$|At 1620, Francis Bacon repudiated mere {{experience}} and enumerative induction, {{and sought to}} couple those with neutral and minute and many varied observations before to uncover <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world's</b> structure and causal relations beyond the present scope of experience via his method of inductivism, which nonetheless required enumerative induction as a component.|$|R

5|$|At {{this point}} in his life, Beebe was forming a close {{friendship}} with then-president Theodore Roosevelt, which would last until Roosevelt's death in 1919. Beebe admired Roosevelt's skill as a field naturalist as well as his advocacy of conservation, and Roosevelt's fame made his support highly valuable in Beebe's scientific endeavors. Roosevelt in turn admired Beebe's writing and his respect for <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world.</b> Roosevelt frequently provided praise for Beebe's books, and went on to write introductions to Beebe's books Tropical Wild Life and Jungle Peace.|$|E
5|$|Clathrus ruber was {{illustrated}} in 1560 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner in his Nomenclator Aquatilium Animantium—Gesner mistook the mushroom for a marine organism.

5|$|Helen Beatrix Potter {{was born}} on 28 July 1866 in London to {{barrister}} Rupert William Potter and his wife Helen (Leech) Potter. She was educated by governesses and tutors, and passed a quiet and solitary childhood reading, painting, drawing, tending a nursery menagerie of small animals, and visiting museums and art exhibitions. Her interests in <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world</b> and country life were nurtured with holiday trips to Scotland, the English Lake District, and Camfield Place, the Hertfordshire home of her paternal grandparents.|$|E
5|$|On {{his trip}} to Germany, Ruisdael {{encountered}} water mills which he turned into a principal subject for painting, the first artist to ever do so. Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice, dated 1653, is a prime example. The ruins of Egmont Castle near Alkmaar were another favourite subject of Ruisdael's and feature in The Jewish Cemetery, of which he painted two versions. With these, Ruisdael pits <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world</b> against the built environment, which has been overrun by the trees and shrubs surrounding the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Patterns {{in nature}} are visible regularities of form found in <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world.</b> These {{patterns}} recur in different contexts and {{can sometimes be}} modelled mathematically. Natural patterns include symmetries, trees, spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tessellations, cracks and stripes. Early Greek philosophers studied pattern, with Plato, Pythagoras and Empedocles attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.|$|E

50|$|Natural laws, so called, are {{statements}} of humans' observations, thus are epistemological—concerning human knowledge—the epistemic.

Blurring epistemic with ontic—as by incautiously presuming a natural law {{to refer to a}} causal mechanism, or to trace structures realistically during unobserved transitions, or to be true regularities always unvarying—tends to generate a category mistake.|$|R
5|$|Priestley {{eventually}} {{decided to}} return to his theological studies and, in 1752, matriculated at Daventry, a Dissenting academy. Because he had already read widely, Priestley was allowed to skip {{the first two years of}} coursework. He continued his intense study; this, together with the liberal atmosphere of the school, shifted his theology further leftward and he became a Rational Dissenter. Abhorring dogma and religious mysticism, Rational Dissenters emphasised the rational analysis of <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world</b> and the Bible.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to future}} history works by other authors such as Isaac Asimov, Le Guin's fictional works {{set in the}} Hainish {{universe}} explore the idea of human society expanding across the galaxy. Books like The Dispossessed, The Left Hand of Darkness, and The Word for World is Forest also explore the effects of various social and political systems. Le Guin's later Hainish novels also challenge contemporary ideas about gender, ethnic differences, the value of ownership, and human beings' relationship to <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most common {{objections}} to evolution dispute whether evolution can truly account for all the apparent complexity and order in <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world.</b> It is argued that evolution is too unlikely or otherwise lacking to account for various aspects of life, and therefore that an intelligence, such as God of the Abrahamic religions, must at the very least be appealed to for those specific features.|$|E

5|$|Although Beebe {{attempted}} {{to ensure that}} Barton would receive credit as the Bathysphere's inventor and Beebe's fellow diver, the popular media tended to ignore Barton and pay attention only to Beebe. Barton was often resentful of this, believing Beebe to be deliberately hogging the fame. Beebe in turn lacked patience for Barton's unpredictable moods, and felt that Barton did not display the proper respect for <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world.</b> Still, Beebe and Barton both had something the other needed: Beebe for {{his experience as a}} marine biologist, and Barton for his mechanical skill. Out of pragmatic concern for the success of their dives, they managed to resolve their disagreements well enough to work together at Nonsuch Island, although they did not remain on good terms afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Beebe {{described}} his religious beliefs {{as a combination}} of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His religion was largely the result of seeking to combine his sense of awe and wonder at <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>world</b> with a scientific understanding of its workings. He was highly critical of efforts to use science to justify political ideologies, such as socialism or the belief that women were inferior to men. Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries at the zoo, although this was largely {{out of fear that}} these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.|$|E
