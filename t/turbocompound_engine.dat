40|$|Two turbocompound {{diesel engines}} were {{installed}} in Class VIII heavy-duty vehicles {{to determine the}} fuel consumption potential and performance characteristics. One turbocompound powered vehicle was evaluated at the Cummins Pilot Center where driveability, fuel consumption, torsional vibration, and noise were evaluated. Fuel consumption testing showed a 14. 8 % benefit for the <b>turbocompound</b> <b>engine</b> in comparison to a production NTC- 400 used as a baseline. The <b>turbocompound</b> <b>engine</b> also achieved lower noise levels, improved driveability, improved gradeability, and marginally superior engine retardation. The second <b>turbocompound</b> <b>engine</b> was placed in commercial service and accumulated 50, 000 miles on a cross-country route without malfunction. Tank mileage revealed a 15. 92 % improvement over a production NTCC- 400 which was operating on the same route...|$|E

The results indicate that a screw compressor-expander system is feasible up to at least 750 HP, dry operation of the rotors is feasible, cost and producibility are uncertain, and the system will yield about 4 % improvement in brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) over the advanced <b>turbocompound</b> <b>engine...</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of Bryton Bottoming Systems (BBS) as {{waste heat recovery}} devices for future adiabatic diesel engines in heavy duty trucks is presented. Parametric studies were performed to evaluate the influence of external and internal design parameters on BBS performance. Conceptual design and trade-off studies were undertaken to estimate the optimum configuration, size, and cost of major hardware components. The potential annual fuel savings of long-haul trucks equipped with BBS were estimated. The addition of a BBS to a turbocharged, nonaftercooled adiabatic engine would improve fuel economy {{by as much as}} 12 %. In comparison with an aftercooled, <b>turbocompound</b> <b>engine,</b> the BBS-equipped turbocharged engine would offer a 4. 4 % fuel economy advantage. If installed in tandem with an aftercooled <b>turbocompound</b> <b>engine,</b> the BBS could effect a 7. 2 % fuel economy improvement. The cost of a mass-produced 38 Bhp BBS is estimated at about $ 6460 or 170 /Bhp. Technical and economic barriers that hinder the commercial introduction of bottoming systems were identified.

40|$|In the Advanced Adiabatic Development program, the {{following}} technology {{were identified as}} critical: piston development for oil-less, adiabatic engine; positive displacement compounding and charge system; experimental evaluation of the preheat concept; combustion system with positive ignition assist; and ceramic manufacturing technology. Of these five areas, ceramic manufacturing technology is the pacing item, and is already being addressed by several organizations. Therefore the four remaining areas need immediate attention. Since the lead time involved in engine development and production is long, this technology development should be done concurrently with the AAD engine development. A four year program is outlined which will simultaneously study these first four areas.

40|$|Turbocompounding {{has been}} a {{development}} on heavy diesel engines to improve the utilisation of exhaust heat energy. This system, however, introduces additional pumping losses and exhaust back pressure. Previous {{research has shown that}} the introduction of a divided exhaust period (DEP) to the <b>turbocompound</b> <b>engine</b> using staggered timing on exhaust valves feeding individual manifolds lowers the exhaust back pressure, improving engine breathing and behaviour. Exhaust flow is divided into two distinct flow paths beginning at the exhaust valves – through the turbocharger (blowdown), and bypassing it (scavenging). However, research showed that using one exhaust valve for each flow path can significantly lower the effective flow areas for exhaust gases at higher engine speeds. This leads to highly choked flow and consequently reduced engine output. A solution proposed was the division of the flow paths external to the exhaust port, henceforth named external DEP (ExDEP). In this solution, both exhaust valves open identical to those of the original engine, but the gas flow is divided downstream with the use of independent valves. By the use of ExDEP on a turbocompounded diesel engine the above research resulted in a brake specific fuel consumption benefit of up to 4 % over a regular turbocharged engine. This thesis project, conducted at the Advanced Technology and Research division of Volvo Group Trucks Technology in association with the Combustion department of Chalmers University, aims to implement and evaluate the effects of ExDEP on an existing GT-SUITE simulation model of a two-stage turbocompounded Volvo HDE 13 engine. Various flow components (valve types) and architectures are modelled. The effect of timing and phasing of the ExDEP valves on engine performance is investigated. Resizing of the existing turbine is investigated due to the altered gas flow. Rough CAD models are prepared to determine the feasibility of physically incorporating such systems on existing engines. A further adaptation to the existing engine model is the incorporation of CAD data of a novel engine concept currently being developed at Volvo GTT, in order to study the feasibility of ExDEP with this engine. With the implementation of ExDEP, a primary advantage foreseen is that the exhaust flow into the turbines can be constantly controlled. This eliminates the need for variable geometry turbochargers, bringing large reductions in system cost and complexity. It can enable other innovative technologies such as Miller cycle operation, air hybrid operation when an air tank is coupled to the exhaust manifold...|$|E

The studies are executed by the model, created on the base of generalized numerical method of calculation of diesel engine performance, complemented by authors for the presence of power turbine. By using different combinations of minimum cross sections of power turbine and turbine compressor of 8 ЧВН 15 / 16 diesel engine, the possibility of maximum gain receipt according to ge about 7. 7 g/(kWt × h) using reduction gear box with coefficient of efficiency about 0. 95 is shown.

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation of the turbocharged <b>turbocompounded</b> direct-injection diesel <b>engine</b> system {{was developed in}} order to study the performance characteristics of the total system as major design parameters and materials are varied.

The master cylinder model describes the reciprocator intake, compression, combustion and exhaust processes in sufficient detail to define the mass and energy transfers in each subsystem of the total engine system. Appropriate thermal loading models relate the heat flow through critical system components to material properties and design details. From this information, the simulation predicts the performance gains, and assesses the system design trade-offs which would result from the introduction of selected heat transfer reduction materials in key system components, over a range of operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Engine {{boosting}} via turbocharging is {{a method}} to increase the engine power output with minimal or no increase in engine parasitic, frictional and pumping losses. Turbocharging in conjunction with engine down-sizing and down-speeding allows a reduction of engine fuel consumption, while maintaining a high engine power output. However, turbocharging introduces a lag in engine transient response, caused by the finite amount of time required by the turbocharger to accelerate, which has to be minimized. Electric turbocharger assistance consists of coupling an electric motor/generator to a standard turbocharger. The scope of the motor/generator {{is to increase the}} power available to accelerate the rotor assembly, so that the time to boost is reduced. The motor/generator could also be utilized to brake the turbocharger to control boost and avoid over-speeds, thus replacing the conventional waste-gate. Furthermore, electric assistance allows turbocompounding to be implemented. <b>Turbocompounding</b> improves the <b>engine</b> efficiency by utilizing the turbine and motor/generator to recuperate additional exhaust flow energy. In this thesis, the electric turbocharger assistance impact on the turbocharger and engine performance is studied. An electrically assisted turbocharger prototype has been developed by industrial partners and it has been tested by the author of this thesis. The performance of the turbocharger turbine and motor/generator has been characterized over the full speed range and the impact of the electric assistance on the turbine flow has been investigated experimentally. It has not been possible to characterize the turbine up to choking conditions, so the data has been extrapolated via a mean-line model. The performance data obtained has been utilized to generate a model of the assisted turbocharger, which has been coupled to a one-dimensional model of a non-highway 7 -litre diesel engine. This model has been utilized to study the impact of electric turbocharger assistance on the engine transient performance. The electrical machine characterization revealed that the switched reluctance motor/generator operates efficiently up to a speed of 135, 000 rev/min, {{making it one of the}} fastest running switched reluctance machines of this size.
