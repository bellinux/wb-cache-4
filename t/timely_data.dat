In addition, because the PGP demonstration relied on the fee-for-service model, PGPs had little control over where attributed patients chose to seek care.

5000|$|Data {{warehouse}} (DW) is {{a repository}} of an organization's electronically stored data. Data warehouses are designed to manage and store the data. Data warehouses differ from business intelligence (BI) systems, because BI systems are designed to use data to create reports and analyze the information, to provide strategic guidance to management. Metadata is an important tool in how data is stored in data warehouses. The purpose of a data warehouse is to house standardized, structured, consistent, integrated, correct, [...] "cleaned" [...] and <b>timely</b> <b>data,</b> extracted from various operational systems in an organization. The extracted data are integrated in the data warehouse environment to provide an enterprise-wide perspective. Data are structured {{in a way to}} serve the reporting and analytic requirements. The design of structural metadata commonality using a data modeling method such as entity relationship model diagramming is important in any data warehouse development effort. They detail metadata on each piece of data in the data warehouse. An essential component of a data warehouse/business intelligence system is the metadata and tools to manage and retrieve the metadata. Ralph Kimball describes metadata as the DNA of the data warehouse as metadata defines the elements of the data warehouse and how they work together.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Health {{information}} technology (HIT) may improve health care quality and outcomes, {{in part by}} making information available in a timelier manner. However, there are few studies documenting the changes in <b>timely</b> availability of <b>data</b> {{with the use of}} a sophisticated electronic medical record (EMR), nor a description of how the <b>timely</b> availability of <b>data</b> might differ with different types of EMRs. We hypothesized that <b>timely</b> availability of <b>data</b> would improve with use of increasingly sophisticated forms of HIT. Methods We used an historical observation design (2004 – 2006) using electronic data from office visits in an integrated delivery system with three types of HIT: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. We calculated the monthly percentage of visits using the various types of HIT for entry of visit diagnoses into the delivery system's electronic database, and the time between the visit and the availability of the visit diagnoses in the database. Results In January 2004, when only Basic HIT was available, 10 % of office visits had diagnoses entered on the same day as the visit and 90 % within a week; 85 % of office visits used paper forms for recording visit diagnoses, 16 % used Basic at that time. By December 2006, 95 % of all office visits had diagnoses available on the same day as the visit, when 98 % of office visits used some form of HIT for entry of visit diagnoses (Advanced HIT for 67 % of visits). Conclusion Use of HIT systems is associated with dramatic increases in the timely availability of diagnostic information, though the effects may vary by sophistication of HIT system. <b>Timely</b> clinical <b>data</b> are critical for real-time population surveillance, and valuable for routine clinical care. </p...|$|R

50|$|The {{technology}} behind Audience Screening is not new, {{but it does}} {{represent the}} evolution of traditional behavioral targeting. Behavioral targeting allows the publisher to identify and bucket groups of impressions together based on the audience profile and past traffic experience. Once an advertiser identifies the audience they are looking to reach, publishers can sell this inventory accurately. The problem with this model {{is that it is}} not as fluid and flexible as the web appears to be. The experiences and the profiles of the audience change quickly and are reactive to the environment around them, so the past behavior of an audience, though relatively accurate, is still flawed. The Audience Screen model actually identifies this information in real time and can be updated faster and with more detailed accuracy. Audience Screening takes into account audience profile data, preferably in conjunction with industry reliable sources such as Claritas or Simmons, and merges this with data referring to the page where the ad is shown, the category of the site and more recent events (i.e. News, etc.). In this way the audience member being potentially show the advertisements is evaluated based on more recent, <b>timely</b> <b>data</b> and positioned as either more or less desirable to an advertiser or more or less likely to become a customer. In addition, we can overlay the traditional targeting metrics such as frequency caps and successive messaging to determine the most effective model for reaching and converting customers while limiting budget exposure. It’s a higher reward, lower risk model which is becoming more effective as time moves forward.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{wireless}} sensor network (WSN) applications demand <b>timely</b> <b>data</b> delivery. However, existing WSNs are designed to conserve energy and not to support <b>timely</b> <b>data</b> transmission. This paper shows how WSNs can be dimensioned, deployed and operated such that both reliable and <b>timely</b> <b>data</b> delivery is ensured while scarce energy is preserved. The presented solution employs a novel Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol that incorporates topology control mechanisms to ensure <b>timely</b> <b>data</b> delivery and reliability control mechanisms to deal with inherently fluctuating wireless links. An industrial process automation and control scenario at an oil refinery in Portugal is used to define protocol requirements. The paper details a TinyOS implementation of the protocol and its evaluation in a testbed. Under high traffic load, the protocol delivers 100 % of data in time using a maximum node duty cycle as little as 2. 48 %. In an idle network a maximum node duty cycle of only 0. 62 % is achieved. This proposed protocol is thus an extremely energy efficient solution for time-critical data delivery...|$|E
