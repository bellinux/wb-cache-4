40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} <b>tumor</b> <b>responses</b> {{in patients}} treated with anti-angiogenic agents for {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) by assessing intratumoral changes using a dual-energy CT (DECT) (based on Choi’s criteria) and {{to compare it}} to traditional Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Materials and Methods: Ten NSCLC patients treated with bevacizumab underwent DECT. <b>Tumor</b> <b>responses</b> to anti-angiogenic therapy were assessed and compared with the baseline CT results using both RECIST (size changes only) and Choi’s criteria (reflecting net tumor enhancement). Kappa statistics was used to evaluate agreements between <b>tumor</b> <b>responses</b> assessed by RECIST and Choi’s criteria. Results: The weighted κ value for the comparison of <b>tumor</b> <b>responses</b> between the RECIST and Choi’s criteria was 0. 72. Of 31 target lesions (21 solid nodules, 8 lymph nodes, and two ground-glass opacity nodules [GGNs]), five lesions (16 %) showed discordant responses between RECIST and Choi’s criteria. Iodine-enhanced images allowed for a distinction between tumor enhancement and hemorrhagic response (detected in 14 % [4 of 29, excluding GGNs] of target lesions on virtual nonenhanced images). Conclusion: DECT may serve as a useful tool for response evaluation after anti-angiogenic treatment in NSCLC patients by providing information on the net enhancement of target lesions without obtaining non-enhanced images...|$|R

Since it failed to achieve <b>tumor</b> <b>responses</b> resulting in progression, he was given interferon-alpha and capecitabine. After 2 courses of combination therapy with IFN-alpha and capecitabine, significant <b>tumor</b> <b>responses</b> were obtained; two out of four pulmonary metastatic sites disappeared completely, one site showed over 50 % decrease in size, and the remaining one site did no change in size. The regimen was well tolerated and toxicity observed was World Health Organization grade 1 anorexia. His disease status was maintained as stable disease by the repeated treatment with interferon-alpha and capecitabine for 17 months after <b>tumor</b> <b>responses</b> were obtained. However, tumor progression was observed thereafter. He is at present under treatment with sorafenib. This is the first case report of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, which showed different responses to two types of 5 -fluorouracil prodrugs in combination with interferon-alpha, suggesting the biochemical modulation of capecitabine by interferon-alpha as a possible mechanism underlying the antitumor effect of the combination of interferon-alpha and capecitabine at the clinical setting.

Little is known about skin reactions in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients during immunotherapy. Here, we retrospectively investigated immune-related adverse skin reactions (irAEs) in 40 patients with metastatic NSCLC treated with the anti-PD- 1 antibody nivolumab. 7 out of 40 patients (17 %) developed an irAEs. Skin irAEs correlated with <b>tumor</b> <b>responses</b> in 5 of 12 responders (42 %) as compared to 2 of 27 non-responders (7 %).

In this study, we applied multiple modality molecular imaging techniques to pre-clinical monitoring of early <b>tumor</b> <b>responses</b> to Doxil, focusing on imaging of apoptosis. Methods: Mice bearing UM-SCC- 22 B human {{head and neck}} squamous cancer tumors received either PBS or 1 to 2 doses of Doxil&# 174; (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection) (10 mg/kg/dose). Bioluminescence signals from an apoptosis-responsive reporter gene were captured for apoptosis evaluation. Tumor metabolism and proliferation were assessed by 18 F-FDG and 3 '- 18 F-fluoro- 3 '-deoxythymidine (18 F-FLT) positron emission tomography. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) was performed to calculate averaged apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) for the whole tumor volume. After imaging, tumor samples were collected for histological evaluation, including terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), anti-CD 31, and Ki- 67 immunostaining. Results: Two doses of Doxil significantly inhibited tumor growth. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) indicated apoptosis of tumor cells after just 1 dose of Doxil treatment, before apparent tumor shrinkage. 18 F-FDG and 18 F-FLT PET imaging identified decreased tumor metabolism and proliferation at later time points than those at which BLI indicated apoptosis. MRI measurements of ADC altered in response to Doxil, but only after tumors were treated with 2 doses. Decreased tumor proliferation and increased apoptotic cells were confirmed by changes of Ki- 67 index and apoptotic ratio. Conclusion: Our study of <b>tumor</b> <b>responses</b> to different doses of Doxil demonstrated that {{it is essential to}} combine apoptosis imaging strategies with imaging of other critical biological or pathological pathways, such as metabolism and proliferation, to improve clinical decision making in apoptosis-related diseases and interventions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the association between response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1. 1 and 1. 0, and to explore the utility of thyroglobulin (Tg) measurements in assessing <b>tumor</b> <b>responses</b> to sorafenib in patients with radioactive iodine (RAI) -refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). In total, 23 patients with RAI-refractory DTC were enrolled. A comparison of RECIST 1. 1 and 1. 0 was performed in all patients with measurable disease. Following the exclu-sion of patients who were positive for anti-Tg antibody, the correlation between RECIST 1. 1 and Tg was investigated in patients with measurable disease, and the concordance of the change in Tg between these patients and the patients with non-measurable disease only was analyzed over time. <b>Tumor</b> <b>responses,</b> assessed by RECIST 1. 1 and 1. 0, were concordant in 96 % of the 23 records. However, the number of target lesions, according to RECIST 1. 1, was significantly lower than when using RECIST 1. 0. Progressive disease (PD) was identified in one of the five patients who under-went fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) /computed tomography (CT) scanning. A corre-lation between the Tg levels and the sum of the diameters of the target lesions was verified, with the percentage decrease in Tg levels significantly greater than that in the radiograph, demonstrating shrinkage. Furthermore, the percentage change in Tg levels was consistent between the patients with measurable disease and the subjects with non-measurable disease only. In conclusion, in patients with RAI-refractory DTC, RECIST 1. 1 is highly concordant with RECIST 1. 0 in the assessment of responses to sorafenib treatment, with the advantage of simplified procedures and the complemen-tary use of FDG-PET. Tg measurements, in concordance with RECIST 1. 1, are valuable in the evaluation of <b>tumor</b> <b>responses...</b>|$|R
