Offensive counter-terrorist operations may include direct action and hostage recovery. A capability to board ships at anchor, ships underway and off-shore gas and oil platforms is also maintained. TAG (West) is kept at high readiness for a period of 12 months, before being replaced by another squadron in this role.

5|$|Adult mockingbirds {{can fall}} victim to birds of prey such as the great horned owl, screech owl and sharp-shinned hawk, though their {{tenacious}} behavior makes them less likely to being captured. Scrub-jays also have killed and eaten mockingbirds. Snakes rarely capture incubating females. Fledgelings have been prey <b>to</b> <b>domestic</b> cats, red-tailed hawks, and crows. Eggs and nestlings are consumed by blue jays, fish crows and American crows, red-tailed hawks, swallow-tailed kites, snakes, squirrels, and cats.

5|$|Ethylene glycol {{has been}} shown to be toxic to humans and is also toxic <b>to</b> <b>domestic</b> pets such as cats and dogs.

That is roughly 16 mL of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80kg adult and 4 mL for a 20kg child. Poison control centers often use more than a lick or taste in a child or more than a mouthful in an adult as a dose requiring hospital assessment.|$|E

40|$|In {{the growth}} literature, {{there is a}} {{nonlinear}} relationship between economic growth and government size, {{which is similar to}} an inverted U-shaped curve. This curve can be used to determine the optimum share of government expenditures. This paper, using threshold panel approach, attempts to investigate this nonlinear effect for 15 European countries, empirically. For the size of government, four measures are considered as follows: (i) total expenditures <b>to</b> gross <b>domestic</b> product, (ii) final consumption expenditures <b>to</b> gross <b>domestic</b> product, (iii) current expenditures other than final consumption <b>to</b> gross <b>domestic</b> product and (iv) government gross fixed capital formation <b>to</b> gross <b>domestic</b> product. Estimation results show that the inverted U-shaped curve is approved for four measures. The estimated optimum shares are 41. 7 %, 15. 8 %, 19. 4 % and 2. 5 %, respectively. ...|$|R

At the end of the season, Key was named the new county captain following the resignation of David Fulton, a role he took on in order to help his chances of regaining a place in the England side.|$|E
5|$|Governments are {{particularly}} concerned with zoonoses, diseases that humans may acquire from animals. Wild animal populations may harbour diseases {{that can affect}} domestic animals which may acquire them {{as a result of}} insufficient biosecurity. An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating flying foxes, their faeces and urine. The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans. Avian flu H5N1 is present in wild bird populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily transmissible <b>to</b> <b>domestic</b> poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, farm animals and humans include rabies, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis and trichinosis.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} medical issues, lesbians are {{referred}} to as women who have sex with women (WSW) because of the misconceptions and assumptions about women's sexuality and some women's hesitancy to disclose their accurate sexual histories even to a physician. Many self-identified lesbians neglect to see a physician because they do not participate in heterosexual activity and require no birth control, which is the initiating factor for most women to seek consultation with a gynecologist when they become sexually active. As a result, many lesbians are not screened regularly with Pap smears. The U.S. government reports that some lesbians neglect seeking medical screening in the U.S.; they lack health insurance because many employers do not offer health benefits <b>to</b> <b>domestic</b> partners.|$|E

5|$|Innovations to the {{mechanical}} clock continued, with miniaturization leading <b>to</b> <b>domestic</b> clocks in the 15th century, and personal watches in the 16th.

Although Galileo studied the pendulum as early as 1582, he never actually constructed a clock based on that design. The first pendulum clock was designed and built by Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, in 1656. Early versions erred by less than one minute per day, and later ones only by 10seconds, very accurate for their time.|$|E
