5|$|After bee populations dropped 23% in {{the winter}} of 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Agriculture formed a task force to address <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> six years leading up to 2013, more than 10 million {{beehives}} were lost, often to CCD, nearly twice the normal rate of loss. However, according to Syngenta and the F.A.O., the total number of beehives worldwide continues to grow. An insecticide produced by Syngenta was banned by the European Commission in 2013 for use in crops pollinated by bees. Syngenta together with Bayer is challenging this ban in court.|$|E

5|$|After {{three years}} of dating, they {{eventually}} decided to marry while discussing <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> couple's favorite booth at Chasen's, a restaurant in Beverly Hills. They married on March 4, 1952, at the Little Brown Church in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, in a simple and hastily arranged ceremony designed to avoid the press. The only people in attendance were fellow actor William Holden (the best man) and his wife, actress Brenda Marshall (the matron of honor). Nancy was already pregnant during the ceremony; the couple's first child, Patricia Ann Reagan (later better known by her professional name, Patti Davis), was born less than eight months later on October 21, 1952. Their son, Ronald Prescott Reagan (later better known as Ron Reagan) was born six years later on May 20, 1958. Reagan also became stepmother to Maureen Reagan (1941â€“2001) and Michael Reagan (born 1945), the daughter and adopted son of her husband's first marriage to Jane Wyman.|$|E

5|$|At present, it is {{not clear}} what {{evidence}} the President may rely on to be satisfied that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence of a majority of MPs, as the Singapore courts have not yet had to decide <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Sarawak case of Stephen Kalong Ningkan v. Tun Abang Haji Openg, decided on provisions similar to those in the Singapore Constitution, the court found that the phrase ceased to command the confidence of a majority of the Members of Parliament was a term of art which had to be signified by a formal vote of no confidence taken by the legislature. In contrast, a Sabah court held in Datuk Amir Kahar v. Tun Mohd Said bin Keruak, Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sabah that loss of confidence could be assessed on the basis of evidence other than a legislative vote. This might include, for instance, media reports or letters addressed to the President.|$|E
5|$|Being low-lying {{and largely}} {{surrounded}} by water, Norfolk is {{particularly vulnerable to}} rising sea levels. In addition, the land on which it is built is slowly subsiding.

5|$|During William's {{last years}} he {{attempted}} to reform St Martin's, Dover. The king had granted the church to the archbishop and the diocese of Canterbury in 1130, and William had a new church building constructed near Dover. The archbishop had planned to install canons regular into the church, and on William's deathbed dispatched a party of canons from Merton Priory to take over St Martin's. However, the party of canons, who had been accompanied by two bishops and some other clergy, were prevented from entering by a monk of Canterbury Cathedral, who claimed that St Martin's belonged to the monks of the cathedral chapter. The canons from Merton did not press <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of the Canterbury chapter's appeal to Rome, and after William's death, the cathedral chapter sent 12monks to St Martin's instead.|$|E

5|$|In April 1955, a Caltrans {{official}} {{announced that}} US 80 {{would be built}} as a freeway for its entire length in California, {{as it was to}} be included in the Interstate Highway System. In the meantime, while plans moved further along on US 101, the mayor of San Diego asked the California Highway Commission to keep the US 80 project on track. However, the construction was put on hold because of lower traffic levels on US 80, compared to other local highways. State Assemblyman Hegland raised <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Assembly Highway subcommittee in December, stating that the construction of the freeway would help the economy and the Port of San Diego. State Senator Collier went even further and blamed the delay on San Diego County officials, in addition to linking the delay to damaging the program to develop the port. The bridge over the Colorado River was replaced in 1956, at a cost of $1.2 million, and was in use until 1978, when the I-8 bridge was built.|$|E

It passed the Senate a second time in 1828, but again, the House failed to act on it, and the measure died for some years, owing to Johnson's exit from the Senate the next year.|$|E
