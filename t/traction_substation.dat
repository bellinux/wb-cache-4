Various plans, {{including}} turning it into a monorail or abandoning the eastern extremities and turning the rest into part of the New York City Subway, had been proposed. On January 20, 1965, the purchase of the Long Island Rail Road by the State of New York was decided. Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller set in motion work that was need to draft the enabling legislation, to determine a realistic value for the property. The Pennsylvania Railroad submitted a very high initial estimate, and the result of negotiations was a direct payment of $65 million and a similar amount of relief for unpaid taxes. In return, all shares of stock were surrendered to the State along with the property, rolling stock, and infrastructure. The organization that was formed to acquire the railroad from the PRR in August 1966 was the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Authority (now the MTA). However, trimming the LIRR from its system did not provide the relief the PRR sought; after the 1968 merger into Penn Central Transportation it was bankrupt in 1970.The MCTA set out to improve the LIRR by instituting massive capital improvements {{in the form of a}} strengthened electric <b>traction</b> <b>substation</b> system, accelerated track improvements, and new rolling stock.|$|E

40|$|Urban rail {{systems such}} as subways and trams {{transport}} millions of people every day, oering {{a high level of}} service. Most of these systems are fed by direct current (DC). The design of the power supply network of DC electried transit railways is of great importance and requires the use of simulation models. The power supply network is composed of a high voltage network (fed with AC) linked to a traction network (fed with DC) by <b>traction</b> <b>substations.</b> Many simulation models ignore the high voltage network in the design process whereas it has a signicant inuence on the results. A Newton-Raphson algorithm is implemented to solve the AC load ow in the high voltage network, and coupled to the existing simulation software Symphonie. Three dierent high voltage network architectures are simulated, and the simulation results are analyzed. The results show that the voltage drop at the AC side of <b>traction</b> <b>substations</b> and the load sharing between them varies signicantly from one architecture to another. In particular, when several <b>traction</b> <b>substations</b> are connected to the same high voltage loop, voltage drops can be signicant for some <b>traction</b> <b>substations.</b> In conclusion, the design of the power supply network of DC electried transit railways requires the simulation of the high voltage network when several substations are connected to the same high voltage loop.
