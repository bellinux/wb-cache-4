Although his stint {{with the}} band would be short-lived, Iommi made an appearance with Jethro Tull on The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV show. Unsatisfied with the direction of Jethro Tull, Iommi returned to Earth in January 1969. [...] "It just wasn't right, so I left", Iommi said. [...] "At first I thought Tull were great, but I didn't much go for having {{a leader in the}} band, which was Ian Anderson's way. When I came back from Tull, I came back with a new attitude altogether. <b>They</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> that to get on, you got to work for it." ...|$|E

He became a regular bouncer for clubs until he was arrested after a fight that left two patrons injured, {{one of whom was}} rendered unconscious. After a trial, he was sentenced to one year of probation. He also worked as a lifeguard before pursuing a career in bodybuilding. He credits bodybuilding with potentially saving his life.|$|E

2500|$|According to the BBC, at one time, Heaney's books made up {{two-thirds of}} the sales of living poets in the UK. His work often deals with the local {{surroundings}} of Ireland, particularly in Northern Ireland, {{where he was born}} and lived until young adulthood. Speaking of his early life and education, he commented, [...] "I learned that my local County Derry experience, which I had considered archaic and irrelevant to 'the modern world', was to be trusted. <b>They</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> that trust and helped me to articulate it." [...] Death of a Naturalist (1966) and Door into the Dark (1969) mostly focus on the details of rural, parochial life.|$|E

60|$|I was in Switzerland. I {{had come}} out of Italy, over one of the great passes of the Alps, and had since wandered with a guide among the by-ways of the mountains. If those awful solitudes had spoken to my heart, I did not know it. I had found sublimity and wonder in the dread heights and precipices, in the roaring torrents, and the wastes of ice and snow; but as yet, <b>they</b> had <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> nothing else.|$|R
60|$|In {{the same}} way, apparently, {{the hero of}} the popular novel, finding himself {{stranded}} in a foreign land, suddenly recollects that once upon a time he met a refugee, and at once begins to talk.

And when I saw they were full of kindness, I took heart, and I resolved to bring away with me report of all that I saw.

6000|$|Thou know'st how guiltless first I met thy flame, When Love approach'd {{me under}} Friendship's name; [...] 60 My fancy form'd thee of angelic kind, Some {{emanation}} of the all-beauteous Mind. Those smiling eyes, attempering every ray, Shone sweetly lambent with celestial day. Guiltless I gazed; Heaven listen'd while you sung; And truths divine came mended from that tongue. From lips like those, what precept fail'd to move? Too soon <b>they</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> 'twas no sin to love: Back through {{the paths of}} pleasing sense I ran, Nor wish'd an angel whom I loved a man.

A Legion's pace is {{altogether}} different. It is a long, slow stride, that never varies from sunrise to sunset. [...] "Rome's Race--Rome's Pace," [...] as the proverb says. Twenty-four miles in eight hours, neither more nor less. Head and spear up, shield on your back, cuirass-collar open one hand's breadth--and that's how you take the Eagles through Britain.' ...|$|E
60|$|I here make {{acknowledgment}} to {{the trail}} and the trail-makers. <b>They</b> have <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> much. I have lifted the latch-string of the lonely shack, and broken bread with the red hunter. I know the varied voices of the coyote, wizard of the mesa. The trail has strung upon it, as upon a silken cord, opalescent dawns and ruby sunsets. My camping-places return in the music of gold and amber streams. The hunter, the miner, the prospector, have been my companions and my tutors--and what they have given me I hold with jealous hand.|$|R

The horse-shoe sign; for there it is, right {{opposite}} the gold. And what's the horse-shoe sign? The lion is the horse-shoe sign-- the roaring and devouring lion. Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Though I thought I {{was alone}} in the world," [...] she said, after a pause, [...] "I have thought of these things. <b>They</b> have <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> always that {{strength}} was almost a sin, that it was better to be little than great, that all true religion was to shelter the weak and little, encourage the weak and little, help them to multiply and multiply until at last they crawled over one another, to sacrifice all our strength in their cause. But ... always I have doubted the thing they taught." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{days after}} that were spent in study. I must find this subtle poison which {{was strong enough to}} undo the elixir.

Alas! <b>they</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> little. Here and there some hint or stray expression would raise hope in my bosom, but no good ever came of it. Still, month after month, I struggled on. When my heart grew faint I would make my way to the tomb by the palm-trees. There, standing by the dead casket from which the jewel had been rifled, I would feel her sweet presence, and would whisper to her that I would rejoin her if mortal wit could solve the riddle.|$|E
60|$|To give {{an account}} of one's reading is in some sort to {{give an account}} of one's life; and I hope that I shall not offend those who follow me in these papers, if I cannot help {{speaking}} of myself in speaking of the authors I must call my masters: my masters not because <b>they</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> this or that directly, but because I had such delight in them that I could not fail to teach myself from them whatever I was capable of learning. I do not know whether I have been what people call a great reader; I cannot claim even to have been a very wise reader; but I have always been conscious of a high purpose to read much more, and more discreetly, than I have ever really done, and probably it is from the vantage-ground of this good intention that I shall sometimes be found writing here rather than from the facts of the case.|$|E

I was the favorite pet and plaything of the poor actors. <b>They</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> to sing and to dance {{at an age when}} other children are just beginning to learn to read. At five years old I was in what is called 'the profession,' and had made my poor little reputation in booths at country fairs. As early as that, Mr. Holmcroft, I had begun to live under an assumed name--the prettiest name they could invent for me 'to look well in the bills.' It was sometimes a hard struggle for us, in bad seasons, to keep body and soul together. Learning to sing and dance in public often meant learning to bear hunger and cold in private, when I was apprenticed to the stage. And yet I have lived to look back on my days with the strolling players as the happiest days of my life! ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{other men}} in the gang were not {{agreeable}} or congenial companions. <b>They</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> their established modes of intercommunication, and told me several facts about themselves, which did not tend to endear them to me. One of them, 1247, was put in for the manslaughter of his wife by kicking; he was a low-browed, brutal London drayman, and he occupied the next cell to mine, where he disturbed me much in my sleepless nights by his loud snoring. Another, a much slighter and more intelligent-looking man, was a skilled burglar, sentenced to fourteen years for [...] "cracking a crib" [...] in the neighbourhood of Hampstead. A third was a sailor, convicted of gross cruelty to a defenceless Lascar. They all told me {{the nature of their}} crimes with a brutal frankness which fairly surprised me; but when I explained to them in return that I had been put in upon a false accusation, they treated my remarks with a galling contempt that was absolutely unsupportable. After a short time I ceased to communicate with my fellow-prisoners in any way, and remained shut up with my own thoughts in utter isolation.|$|E
60|$|All my life, from boyhood up, I {{have had}} the habit of reading a certain set of anecdotes, written in the quaint vein of The World's ingenious Fabulist, for the lesson <b>they</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> and the {{pleasure}} they gave me. They lay always convenient to my hand, and whenever I thought meanly of my kind I turned to them, and they banished that sentiment; whenever I felt myself to be selfish, sordid, and ignoble I turned to them, {{and they told me}} what to do to win back my self-respect. Many times I wished that the charming anecdotes had not stopped with their happy climaxes, but had continued the pleasing history of the several benefactors and beneficiaries. This wish rose in my breast so persistently that at last I determined to satisfy it by seeking out the sequels of those anecdotes myself. So I set about it, and after great labor and tedious research accomplished my task. I will lay the result before you, giving you each anecdote in its turn, and following it with its sequel as I gathered it through my investigations.|$|E

40|$|In {{teaching}} Ethics or Professional Responsibility, I {{want to do}} {{more than}} teach students the law of the course. While it is important that students become familiar with and able to navigate the rules of professional responsibility, my clinical teaching has helped me develop additional educational objectives that I believe will affect their lives as future lawyers. I categorize my objectives in a three-credit classroom professional responsibility course as three-fold: 1) teaching the law of lawyering; 2) exploring professionalism issues; 20 and 3) critically examining the profession. I will discuss a few of my experiences teaching in the clinic and how <b>they</b> have <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> why a three-credit course on Professional Responsibility should expand its teaching goals beyond the law of the course...|$|R
