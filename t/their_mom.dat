500|$|Ferb was devised as a {{character}} devoid of ill will. Marsh explained, [...] "It was important to us that [...] never did anything with any animosity.

[...] Instead, he and his brother create things for the sheer enjoyment of it or to help out others ("and for the ladies"); for example, Ferb and Phineas carve Candace's face into Mount Rushmore for her birthday, set up a roller derby for a rematch race with his Grandmother Betty Jo's old rival, create a haunted house for their friend Isabella to cure her hiccups and make a super-computer to find out what to do for <b>their</b> <b>mom</b> after being so kind to them.|$|E

When the band is at the record company, Phineas, following the steps his mother gave him, throws a diva tantrum and leaves, unaware that the CEO plans to use a videotape of the band's performance to carry on the band's legacy.|$|E
