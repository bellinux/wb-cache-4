The aim of this work is the proposal to increase performance levels of technological unit in which the micro-turbine is applied. The work presents various ways to increase performance and efficiency of circulation. The possible options are compared {{with each of the}} technological and economic terms. Based on these criteria was selected variant feeding additional water into the circulation. For this design was the work of a mathematical model based on, which was established as the economic balance of the selected variants. The thesis also proposes a technological scheme, which is already incorporated the selected variant and an outline of the verification tests...|$|E
40|$|Rotor-to-stator rub is a {{very common}} topic in rotor {{dynamics}} and several models have been proposed in the literature. Anyhow these models are often able to explain only the experimental dynamical behaviour of simple test rigs, which are deliberately reproducing a Jeffcott rotor. On the contrary case, histories related to real machines are seldom presented and analysed. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present an actual case history of a large <b>turbogenerator</b> <b>unit</b> that was subjected to partial arc rubs. The experimental results are shown and discussed along with the model-based diagnostic strategy employed to identify the fault severity and the location of the shaft cross-sections where the heaviest rubs occurred. Comparisons between experimental data and simulated vibrations caused by the identified fault are shown to validate the proposed methodology...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} two experiences of {{application of a}} model-based fault identification method on real machines. The first case presented is an unbalance identification on a 320 -MW <b>turbogenerator</b> <b>unit</b> operating in a fossil power plant. In the second case, concerning a machine {{of the same size}} but of a different manufacturer, the Low Pressure (LP) turbine was affected by a rub in the sealings and this time, the fault was modeled by local bows. The identification of the faults is performed by means of a model-based identification technique in frequency domain, suitably modified in order to take into account simultaneous faults. The theoretical background of the applied method is briefly illustrated and some considerations also are presented about the best choice of the rotating speed set of the run-down transient to be used for an effective identification and about the appropriate weighting of vibration measurements at the machine bearings...|$|E
