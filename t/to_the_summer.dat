5|$|Athens is home <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> {{music festival}} Athfest, , the Athens Popfest {{and the late}} spring Athens Human Rights Festival and North Georgia Folk Festival. The college radio station WUOG (90.5 FM), the {{low-power}} (100.7) FM WPPP-LP and the free weekly Flagpole are the city's most prominent modern music media. Athens has never produced a major local label like many similar indie rock towns; the most important label of the 1970s and 1980s was DB Records, based out of Atlanta, though jangle pop pioneers Kindercore Records and Wuxtry Records were also Athens-based.|$|E

5|$|Glover's pika (Ochotona gloveri) is {{a species}} of mammal in the family Ochotonidae. It was first {{described}} in 1922, by Michael Rogers Oldfield Thomas. The summer dorsal pelage is grayish rufous, grayish brown, or tea brown in colour. The winter pelage is similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> pelage, but is lighter in tone. Endemic to China, it is found in high altitudes of northeastern Tibet, southwestern Qinghai, western Sichuan, and northwestern Yunnan. It is a generalist herbivore, and is known to construct haypiles. It is rated as {{a species of}}least concernby theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature. It is also regionally red listed as least concern in China.|$|E
5|$|Grapico {{was first}} sold in 1914 in New Orleans, Louisiana by J. Grossman's Sons. In the Summer of 1917, {{businessman}} R. R.

Present Grapico distributor Buffalo Rock, an independent Pepsi bottler based in Birmingham, Alabama, purchased the Grapico business in 1981. The J.

5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks {{whether or not}} he should compare his beloved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> season, and argues that he should not because the {{comparison}} does not properly express the depths of his emotion. He also states that his beloved will live on forever through the words of the poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Leading up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> Olympics, Solo {{received}} a public warning from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) after a June 15 urine test concluded the banned substance Canrenone had been detected.

She cooperated with the USADA and provided them with the necessary information to prove that it was a mistake. Her story checked out and she was cleared with a public warning. The positive test did not require Solo to withdraw from any pre-Olympic matches.|$|E

5|$|The {{brightest}} {{star in the}} night sky, Sirius is recorded in the earliest astronomical records. Every year, it disappears for seventy days {{before returning to the}} night sky just before sunrise. Its displacement from the ecliptic causes this heliacal rising to be remarkably regular compared to other stars, with a period of almost exactly 365.25 days holding it constant relative to the solar year. This occurs at Cairo on 19July (Julian), placing it just prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> solstice and the onset of the annual flooding of the Nile during antiquity.|$|E
5|$|Through {{connections}} that Cohen had with record producer Samuel Charters, the group signed a recording contract with Vanguard Records in December 1966, {{just as the}} label, which had primarily released folk music, was attempting to branch out into the growing psychedelic rock scene. While the band waited to record their debut album, they were present at the Human Be-In, along with other influential San Francisco musical acts, including Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Quicksilver Messenger Service. The event was a prelude <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> of Love and helped publicize counterculture ideals such as ecology, free-love {{and the use of}} illicit drugs.|$|E

He missed the Iraq's 5–1 win over Pakistan and the quarterfinal with Saudi Arabia which ended in a 1–1 draw, leading the match to {{penalties}} where Iraq lost 9–8. Saeed appeared in all of Iraq's matches in the 1988 Summer Olympics qualifiers and scored four goals: three against Jordan and one against Qatar, getting qualified <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> Olympics {{for the third time}} in the row where they were knocked out again from the group stage after finishing 3rd in the Group B table. 1988 was the first year where Saeed didn't score any goal since his debut year in 1976.|$|E
5|$|By the mid 1890s, {{the station}} was {{frequently}} overcrowded and North Philadelphia and the northern suburbs grew in population. The completion of the Delair Bridge in 1896 allowed passengers to ride trains directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> resorts of southern New Jersey (rather than taking a ferry to Camden) further increased traffic on the line. George B. Roberts, president of the railroad, used his social connections to hire Theophilus Parsons Chandler, Jr. to construct a new station. The new station was constructed on a former freight yard {{on the south side}} of the tracks (across from the previous station), where there was more space for the station. The site also provided better connections for passengers using newly electrified streetcars on Glenwood Avenue and North Broad Street to reach the station.|$|E
5|$|Leblanc first {{participated in}} an {{international}} tournament when he played for the Canadian national junior team at the 2008 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in August 2008. He led the team with three goals and added two assists for five points as Canada won the gold medal. Leblanc was then invited {{to try out for}} the national junior team prior to the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, but {{was one of the last}} players cut from the team. There was speculation that his participation in the NCAA rather than the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) hindered his chances of making the team, as CHL players had played considerably more games than those in the NCAA. Leblanc also had university exams scheduled around the time of the camp. He was invited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> camp the following year in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, and was one of the top scorers at the camp.

5|$|The {{progress}} of the war from September 1939 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> of 1941, with a few exceptions, seemed to validate the Luftwaffes pre-war focus on the offensive use of its fighter arm. The success of the Luftwaffe in the Norwegian Campaign and the battles of the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia, and Greece had vindicated this method. The Luftwaffe had defended German airspace by driving away enemy air power from Germany's borders and defeating their enemies in their own skies. The occupation of its opponent's territory denied Germany's enemies the bases to effectively strike at German targets by air. German daylight defences were rarely tested during this time. This run of events, and {{the knowledge that the}} RAF was only capable of short penetrations over France in daylight, led the Luftwaffe to believe Germany was invulnerable to attack. To maintain the offensive on the front line, bomber production dominated the air industry while the production of fighters was given less priority.|$|E
5|$|The revolting nobility had thus chosen Uroš {{as their}} {{candidate}} for king; from 1242 to spring 1243, a {{war for the}} throne was fought, which ended with Vladislav being forced {{to give up the}} crown in favour of Uroš. It seems that Uroš quickly captured Vladislav and held him in prison. The main resistance against Uroš was led by Vladislav's wife, Beloslava. Beloslava spent some time exiled in Ragusa. The fact that she was the organizer of the resistance against Uroš is known from an edict dated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> of 1243, in which the Ragusans swore to King Uroš that they would not support Beloslava's resistance work. Since Vladislav is not mentioned anywhere, it means that he was likely imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|While {{development}} is now tightly controlled {{in the vicinity}} of the Forbidden City, throughout the past century uncontrolled and sometimes politically motivated demolition and reconstruction has changed the character of the areas surrounding the Forbidden City. Since 2000, the Beijing municipal government has worked to evict governmental and military institutions occupying some historical buildings, and has established a park around the remaining parts of the Imperial City wall. In 2004, an ordinance relating to building height and planning restriction was renewed to establish the Imperial City area and the northern city area as a buffer zone for the Forbidden City. In 2005, the Imperial City and Beihai (as an extension item <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> Palace) were included in the shortlist for the next World Heritage Site in Beijing.|$|E
