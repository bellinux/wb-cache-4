5|$|Netball is {{most popular}} in Commonwealth countries, {{and the most}} popular women's spectator sport in Australia and Tanzania and the effort to {{increase}} media attention and participation for women's sport often goes to Olympic sports with low participation rates, low rates of interest and few facilities.

30|$|We tested, for {{the first}} time, the {{association}} between ACTN 3 R 577 X polymorphism and <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> athletic status in Italian athletes. Our results indicate that <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> athletes have a lower 577 RR than 577 XX genotype frequency, compared to sprint/power athletes (p[*]=[*] 0.044). No {{significant difference in the}} ACTN 3 R 577 X polymorphism genotype distribution was found between the <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> athletes, endurance athletes, and control group. Furthermore, the ACTN 3 R 577 X genotype distribution was similar between elite-level and national-level <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> athletes, suggesting that this polymorphism is not influential among <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> athletes.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{our results}} confirm, for the Italian population, the recent data {{published}} by Eynon et al. [26] that ACTN 3 R 577 X polymorphism is not {{significantly associated with}} <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> athletic status, when <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> athletes are compared to endurance athletes and non-athletic controls, and the 577 RR genotype is overrepresented in power/sprint athletes compared to <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> athletes.|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of organizations in South Africa are introducing formal organizational <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> activities, without any scientific knowledge on whether participation in these activities holds benefits {{for the management of}} diversity in the organization. The purpose of this research was to identify the indicators of an organizational <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> intervention that contributes to the effective management of a diverse workforce. The qualitative exploratory study was conducted among 63 sport participants of 9 financial organizations that participate in organizational <b>team</b> <b>sport.</b> The data were collected by means of focus group interviews. The results indicate that organizational <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> interventions hold benefits such as competitiveness, same goals, open communication, friends, trust and respect, learn from one another, commitment, and less stereotyping. The benefits that organizational <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> interventions hold for the company are better client service, employees work in harmony, they are healthier and motivated, they have good interpersonal relationships, and the company is more profitable and can make social investments. Therefore, organizational <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> contributes towards an organization’s requirements for an effective workforce. The findings of this study contribute valuable new knowledge to the literature on organizational <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> as an intervention for diversity management. Human Resource Managemen...|$|R

30|$|Participation in <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> is {{challenged}} by social comparisons with colleagues and superiors, the organisational {{culture and the}} facilities available within the workplace [15], and psychological barriers relating to autonomy, competence and relatedness [15, 16]. Self-determination theory (SDT) [17] suggests supporting people’s innate needs for autonomy (i.e. feeling free and fully volitional to engage in <b>team</b> <b>sport),</b> competence (i.e. feeling capable to complete a skill in <b>team</b> <b>sport)</b> and relatedness (i.e. feeling supported, understood and valued by a social group) through the provision of an activity (e.g. <b>team</b> <b>sport)</b> may promote wellbeing and autonomous motivation [14 – 16]. Good evidence indicates supporting basic needs is an effective behaviour change strategy within a workplace, sports and exercise setting [15 – 17]. For these reasons, workplace <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> interventions should be underpinned by behaviour change theories {{with a focus on}} the social environment [15 – 17].|$|R

Employees’ work values, i. e. self-actualisation, security and relationships improved which, in turn, led to perceptions of increased productivity.

40|$|Abstract <b>Team</b> <b>sport</b> {{has become}} driven by {{commercial}} drivers, and increasingly clubs operate as limited companies. In sport there are obviously other drivers than just pure economic success {{that are also}} present in the environment. However, {{it seems to be}} extremely difficult to operate profitably in <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> business. In general Finnish <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> businesses seem to underperform in business terms, and therefore the topic is particularly relevant. Indeed, relatively little academic research has been made in this field. This research is looking for insight in how consumer customer relations could be enhanced in <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> leading to more sustainable business operations. The research strategy A literature review is included in the research, which pays attention particularly on three subjects. The characteristics of <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> products are discussed. This is followed by review of team sports’ customers. Then special features of customer relations in a sport context are explored. Based on the review, a theoretical framework is constructed, which identifies five facets explaining different fans’ motivation to attend games. Also central elements in fans’ management are noticed. The framework is tested in a quantitative survey research. Based on survey results one strategy to classify fans is presented and elements explaining their attendance-motivations are discussed. The results provide views for customer relation enhancement in <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> context. Implications The study identifies features which particularly explain the behavior of specific fan classes, and considers how their relations could be enhanced. In the end, the research suggests that building strong club identity and inclusive strategies are central in the enhancement of <b>team</b> <b>sport</b> customer relations...|$|R
