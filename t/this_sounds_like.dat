LAUNCHcast's James Poletti called the song a [...] "perfectly competent Bond theme", but [...] "the formula seems a little too easy.

[...] Melody Maker stated, [...] "You know what <b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> before you hear it. If the people in charge want Garbage, then why not let them do what Garbage do?"

500|$|The year 1968 {{marked the}} start of what Dylan himself later termed his [...] "amnesia", {{referring}} {{to a form of}} writer's block he experienced post-John Wesley Harding (1967), when painting had replaced songwriting as his preferred creative outlet. Well known for his unsophisticated musical approach, particularly in comparison to Harrison's broader [...] "harmonic palette", author Simon Leng suggests, Dylan was now eager to learn some more-advanced chords. Harrison began demonstrating various major seventh, diminished and augmented chord shapes – [...] "all these funny chords people showed me when I was a kid", as he later put it.

Bennington commented on the collaborations, stating that [...] "We really felt like {{if we need to}} be inspired and move in another direction. I think when we got Page in, Mike had written this chorus and sang it, and his voice had this tone, and it was unlike anything I'd heard from him before. And I was like, [...] "Dude this is crazy, <b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a Helmet song! It's cool!" [...] And we were like, [...] "Dude, why don't we {{see if we can get}} like Page in here?"

He was awarded the Medal for Merit in 1946 for his contribution to the Manhattan Project. Fermi was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1950. The Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence, known as the Temple of Italian Glories for its many graves of artists, scientists and prominent figures in Italian history, has a plaque commemorating Fermi. In 1999, Time named Fermi on its list of the top 100 persons of the twentieth century. Fermi was widely regarded as an unusual case of a 20th-century [...] physicist who excelled both theoretically and experimentally. The historian of physics, C. P. Snow, wrote that [...] "if Fermi had been born a few years earlier, one could well imagine him discovering Rutherford's atomic nucleus, and then developing Bohr's theory of the hydrogen atom.

500|$|Timberlake {{described}} [...] "SexyBack" [...] as [...] "an experiment gone {{right from}} the sort of synthesizer influence to the distorted vocals", adding that it was [...] "one of the songs that the more you listen to it its just hook after hook after hook. Its {{just one of those}} 'flow off the top of your head' tracks, in terms of melody. We wanted to keep it loose and not too rehearsed, it's one of those very experimental records though." [...] Timberlake revealed that he went [...] "left", regarding going more rock, not in how he developed the song, but in the way he sang the song. [...] "I wanted to sing the song like a rock and roll singer, not an R singer. That's the approach." [...] The day before recording, Timberlake and Timbaland had listened to David Bowie's [...] "Rebel Rebel" [...] and the Rapture's [...] "House of Jealous Lovers". Timberlake wanted to achieve the songs' [...] "raw energy". Timberlake said that he modeled himself on Bowie and Prince, and described the song as Bowie and David Byrne [...] "covering" [...] James Brown's 1970 song [...] "Sex Machine". Timberlake said that the song [...] "doesn't qualify as rock or straight funk" [...] and that he was happy with the description [...] "club funk". He was [...] "keen for a new musical direction" [...] following the release of his first album, Justified. [...] "I listened to the radio for a few months and thought, 'All <b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> shit, what do I want to hear?'. That's really all I did.

But I actually have more footnotes than I have pages in the book. That’s because I want people to check my sources." ...|$|E
2500|$|If {{they are}} not secured, the loops of a knitted course will come undone when their yarn is pulled; {{this is known as}} ripping out, {{unravelling}} knitting, or humorously, frogging (because you 'rip it', <b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a frog croaking: 'rib-bit'). To secure a stitch, at least one new loop is passed through it. Although the new stitch is itself unsecured ("active" [...] or [...] "live"), it secures the stitch(es) suspended from it. A sequence of stitches in which each stitch is suspended from the next is called a wale. To secure the initial stitches of a knitted fabric, a method for casting on is used; to secure the final stitches in a wale, one uses a method of binding/casting off. During knitting, the active stitches are secured mechanically, either from individual hooks (in knitting machines) or from a knitting needle or frame in hand-knitting.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, {{when it was}} {{announced}} that both Ricky and Bianca were being reintroduced, executive producer Diederick Santer described them as [...] "a hugely popular and well-loved partnership on the show". Other media sources branded them two of [...] "the most popular characters on the soap" [...] and an [...] "iconic couple". However, Hazel Davis of The Guardian was critical about their reintroduction. She commented, [...] "It's a no-brainer on the show's part. Last year, ratings for EastEnders were at an all-time low. But, just for once, wouldn't it be nice if a soap opera actually introduced new characters with verve and staying power rather than digging up the oldies?". Conversely, Mark Wright from The Stage said that the decision to bring these much-loved characters back [...] "is very welcome". He comments, [...] "Previous returns have been all about the numbers and not about the story, which is the cardinal sin in this game. While there is, of course, the resultant publicity that comes with any new or returning soap character being announced, the storyline possibilities for Ricky and Bianca arriving back in the Square are good. Bianca is turning up with a brood of kids in tow, all belonging to different fathers (how many of them can we expect to see {{over the next couple of}} years?). Like it! Ricky arrives with a glamorous WAG [...] on his arm. [...] I sense friction along the way, especially when Ricky realises he never got over Bianca (how could he?).

2500|$|Executive {{producer}} Ronald D. Moore {{points out}} that the Cylons and Al Qaeda are not necessarily intended to be allegorical: [...] "They have aspects of Al Qaeda and they have aspects of the Catholic Church and they have aspects of America" [...] and in contrast, with the New Caprica storyline the show's humans have been discussed as an allegory not for an America under attack but for an occupied people mounting an insurgency and turning to suicide bombings as a tactic. There is a consensus that with [...] "its third season, the show has morphed into a stinging allegorical critique of America’s three-year occupation of Iraq" [...] as the [...] "cameras record Cylon occupation raids on unsuspecting human civilians with the night-vision green familiar to any TV news viewer. The reasoning of the Cylons is horrifically familiar, they would prefer not to be brutal but they won't accept the failure of a glorious mission." [...] According to Slate [...] "If <b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> Iraq, it should", and [...] "In unmistakable terms, Battlestar Galactica is telling viewers that insurgency (like, say, the one in Iraq) might have some moral flaws, such as the whole suicide bombing thing, but is ultimately virtuous and worthy of support." [...] The [...] "really audacious stroke of this season was showing us a story about a suicide bomber {{from the point of view}} of the bomber and his comrades... because the cause of this terrorist was unquestioningly our own. We sympathize with the insurgents wholeheartedly."

2500|$|The second quatrain {{continues}} {{this trend}} of excuses with subtler wording. [...] "Gentle thou art" [...] {{suggests that the}} youth is of noble birth, and courted by many as a result. [...] Alexander writes that it also suggests that the youth is not [...] "rough and uncouth, but kind," [...] and is therefore more likely to attract sexual attention and be too kind to turn it away. [...] Note the proverb used twice by Shakespeare, [...] "She's beautiful; and therefore to be Wooed: /She is a Woman; therefore to be Wonne," [...] (Henry VI, 5.3.78-79) and [...] "Shee is a woman, therefore may be woo'd, /Shee is a woman, therefore may be wonne," [...] (Titus Andronicus, 2.1.83-84) altered slightly in lines 5-6 of the sonnet. [...] Atkins calls lines 5-6 here, [...] "An intensified (not 'woo' but assail) and significantly perverse variant on the topic (women) and order (first woo then win) of a popular proverb." [...] The final excuse for the youth's infidelity is that no man can resist the advances of a woman. [...] Alexander argues that the observation that end the first eight lines of the poem is much more pointed than that. [...] "To imply that men cannot be expected to resist women because their mothers were women is such nonsense {{that it is an}} excuse which excuses nothing." [...] Most early editors emend the [...] "he" [...] to [...] "she" [...] in line eight, with the suggestion by Thomas Tyrwhitt that [...] "the lady, and not the man, being in this case supposed the wooer, the poet without doubt wrote...she." [...] However, modern editors follow more in line with Martin Seymour-Smith who notes: [...] "The man 'prevails' in the sexual sense...so that the usual emendation 'she' for 'he' is unnecessary and wrong. [...] The woman wants the man to prevail." [...] Regarding lines 7-8, Duncan-Jones remarks: [...] "Though <b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> an obvious truism, Shakespeare's first published work, (Venus and Adonis), described a 'woman's son', Adonis, who refuses the advances of the goddess of love." ...|$|E
