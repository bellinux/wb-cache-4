25|$|Indeed, as {{a result}} of the war and <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> were learned about the {{potential}} of airpower in the region, following the war, the Chief of the Air Staff, Sir Hugh Trenchard, proposed controlling the frontier by air power alone. This plan had proved highly successful in Mesopotamia, Aden and the Transjordan, however, due to the uniqueness of the North-West Frontier and also due to inter-service politics the plan was not accepted until later. In 1937, it was eventually decided that should another war break out with Afghanistan, or in the event of a major tribal uprising, the RAF would take the offensive, while the ground forces would act defensively.|$|E

[...] He also felt it was about not [...] "being afraid of who you are" [...] and Ste was [...] "refreshingly accepting" [...] of his feelings towards a man. Richardson revealed he was shocked to discover the details of the plot. He felt it was interesting to see how Ste coped with the being the victim of domestic violence.|$|E

500|$|Whether {{or not the}} characters' simple speech helps build basic {{language}} skills has been debated. Los Angeles Times critic Lynne Heffley commended the interactive aspects of the show but mentioned that the simplified dialogue can distract from the educational content. She writes, [...] "the repetition of single words and use of incomplete sentences ... offer a mixed result: at times seeming too babyish, at other times effectively underscoring concepts, ideas and vocabulary." [...] In her Common Sense Media review, Andrea Graham stated that the language [...] "should {{not be seen as}} detrimental to a child's speech development – rather, it's a language that young children understand and appreciate." [...] Jaime Egan of Families.com wrote negatively of the dialogue but felt that it did not divert from the educational value. She wrote that [...] "even though the characters do not speak in complete sentences ... <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> this show teaches can be invaluable." [...] The hosts of Ray William Johnson's Equals Three criticized the simplified language, stating that the puppets [...] "didn't even use full sentences. They just said enough words to make themselves understood." [...] Amy Sohn of New York magazine expressed her opinion that the language ruined the show as a whole, calling the characters [...] "speech-impaired." [...] The Star Tribunes James Lileks deemed the series [...] "brain-rotting," [...] and Pete Vonder Haar of the Houston Press called Oobis writers [...] "lazy" [...] for using such a simple concept.|$|E
500|$|Collider.com writer Matt Goldberg {{referred}} to Anna {{as a character}} who [...] "can go from cute to melancholy to odd to defiant and never miss a beat". Emma Koonse of Christian Post described her and Elsa as the [...] "most lovable and charismatic characters yet", while Tony Hicks of San Jose Mercury News wrote that both Anna and Elsa were depicted as devoted from the start, and [...] " [...] confusion and Elsa's anguish as she shuts herself away from the world—and her sister—is palatable." [...] Deepanjana Pal from First Post commented that Anna [...] "is very much a child who needs {{to grow up and}} she does {{in the course of the}} film." [...] The Wall Street Journal suggested that the character become more endearing for being [...] "exactly the free spirit she seems to be". Noah Lee of The Coast News was impressed by the heroine duo Anna and Elsa, and said, [...] "I never lost interest in the drastic measures Anna took or the tribulations Elsa faced." [...] Travis Bean, a reviewer of Community Newspaper Group put emphasis on <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> kids could perceive from the film, saying, [...] "Children can also root for Anna to race through the forest and break through Elsa's icy walls and prove that love conquers all fears." [...] Linda Barnard, Toronto Star film critic, described the sisters as [...] "engaging female characters", particularly praised Anna for her funny and iron-willed characteristics. Sabina Ibarra from Geek Exchange commended that the directors had crafted two very real girls [...] "who come into their own and also come together in this amazing tale." ...|$|E
500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You have your own ideas. We do not want that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I suppose you were made so!... Had you chosen a name which we could approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so. I am sorry but you make your own difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as well as your own. Perhaps in time you will learn <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> we all have to learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become a worry for Pankhurst as well. She decided that Adela should move to Australia, and paid for her relocation. They never saw one another again.|$|E

2500|$|From a {{technical}} point of view, however, the design was entirely sound and highly accurate over long periods. Arnold evidently learned <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> Harrison had learned before him—using a large, quickly oscillating balance (18,000 beats per hour) with small pivots. Arnold's detent escapement provided minimal {{interference with the}} controlling helical balance spring, since the temperature compensation was in the balance itself. Harrison had suggested this as a prerequisite, though he never developed the idea.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{gave the}} song {{positive}} reviews. Jac Chebatoris of Newsweek considered it [...] "the CD's standout tune", and remarked that Parton's {{voice on the}} track is [...] "still powerful and clear after all these years." [...] Allmusic was somewhat less enthusiastic, deeming the song [...] "cloyingly wise", but [...] "catchy enough". Chris Jones, writing for the BBC's online service, remarked on the song's feminist undertones, characterizing it as [...] "a strident ode to <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> Parton's learned in a lifetime spent in an arena where men most definitely are {{men and women are}} expected to be grateful." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{transition}} from innocence to experience {{is shown in}} transformations in Ellie’s thinking and her changing notions towards leadership and courage as the series progresses. Ellie’s reasons for chronicling her experiences also develop throughout the series. She starts out recording for the group who don’t want to die unnoticed and forgotten and continues writing for herself to better understand her own thoughts and feelings. Later on she writes to recreate the past {{which has become a}} lost world to her and preserve <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> she has learnt from it. The Australian bush becomes [...] "a symbol of stability in a world that seems to be disintegrating". Its presence gives hope to the characters throughout the series.|$|E
2500|$|This term 'scaffolding' is {{a useful}} metaphor {{that is used to}} symbolise the process of {{supporting}} a learner {{in the early stages of}} the learning process – as the walls get higher – until there is sufficient evidence of knowledge and skills having been acquired, to then be able to remove that scaffolding so the learner is able to 'stand alone', or be effectively independent enough to continue learning 'alone'. In a similar way, there is a gradual dismantling of the scaffolding as the 'job' becomes more secure and so there is a gradual release of responsibility from the teacher to the learner. As scaffolding is temporary, so too are <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> are constructed to help students as they embark into unfamiliar thinking. As noted by Pearson and Gallagher, [...] "The critical stage of the model is the 'guided practice,' the stage in which the teacher gradually releases task responsibility to the students." [...] As such, these lessons eventually fade away as students become gradually more comfortable with the learning and are able to work without the necessary guidance of the teacher.|$|E
2500|$|A major {{influence}} on Woolf from 1912 onward was Russian literature as Woolf adopted the aesthetic conventions of Russian literature. The style of Fyodor Dostoyevsky with his {{depiction of a}} fluid mind in operation helped to influence Woolf's writings about a [...] "discontinuous writing process", through Woolf objected to Doestoyevsky's obsession with [...] "psychological extremity" [...] and the [...] "tumultuous flux of emotions" [...] in his characters together with his right-wing, monarchist politics as Dostoyevsky was an ardent supporter of the autocracy of Imperial Russia. In contrast to her objections to Dostoyevsky's [...] "exaggerated emotional pitch", Woolf found much to admire {{in the work of}} Anton Chekhov and Leo Tolstoy. Woolf admired Chekhov for his stories of ordinary people living their lives, doing banal things and plots that had no neat endings. From Tolstoy, Woolf drew lessons about how a novelist should depict a character's psychological state and the interior tension within. From Ivan Turgenev, Woolf drew <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> there are multiple [...] "I's" [...] when writing a novel, and the novelist needed to balance those the multiple versions of himself/herself to balance the [...] "mundane facts" [...] of a story vs. the writer's overreaching vision, which required a [...] "total passion" [...] for art.|$|E

2500|$|The {{price of}} the early volumes was set at 21 Shillings (21s) and another 21s for {{accompanying}} map cases but this was considered too costly for professional officers. In 1923, the price was cut to 12s 6d but this left no surplus for advertising and no incentive for booksellers to display them prominently; publishers also set a maximum number of pages per volume, a constraint that led the Committee for Control in 1924 to advise a price increase to 15s. In March 1933, Edmonds showed copies of French, German and Austrian histories to demonstrate their [...] "elaborate and voluminous" [...] nature. The comprehensive nature {{of the project was}} also determined by finance and proposals made by government departments from 1922 to 1939, for histories beyond the Western Front. In 1931, the War Office asked for a volume on the East African Campaign, because of lessons offered by a campaign in such a climate, at such a distance from Britain. The Treasury refused and suggested that the Colonial Office pay, as it had done for the West African volume. East Africa Part I was eventually published in 1941 with Colonial Office money. At the same meeting, the Foreign Office asked for a volume on the Blockade of Germany at their expense, because of <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> could be learned and its utility in conferences on international law; by being labelled Confidential it could be written frankly. Several volumes were financed by interested departments but Edmonds retained supervision and maintained the same editorial control as for the other volumes.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 June {{the same}} year, a small Scots force was beaten by George Dunbar, the Earl of March's son, at the Battle of Nesbit Moor. Douglas led a punitive raid with Murdoch of Fife, Albany's son, {{as far as}} Newcastle to avenge the battle. At the head of 10,000 men he laid waste to the whole of Northumberland. March persuaded Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, and his son Harry [...] "Hotspur" [...] Percy to lie in wait for the {{returning}} Scots at Wooler. Once Douglas' men had made camp at Millfield, relatively low ground, the English army rushed to attack. The Scots did however have keen sentries and the army was able to retreat to the higher ground of Homildon hill, and organised into traditional Schiltron formations. Douglas had not learnt <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> had defeated his great uncle at the Battle of Halidon Hill seventy years previously. The Schiltrons presented a large target for the English Longbowmen, and the formations started to break. A hundred men, under Sir John Swinton of the Swintons of that Ilk, chose to charge the enemy saying: [...] "Better {{to die in the}} mellay than be shot down like deer". [...] All perished. It has been suggested that Douglas hesitated to signal the advance of his main force, and when he did, it was too little too late. Douglas' mauled army met the as yet unbloodied English men at arms, and were routed. Many of Douglas' leading captains were captured, including his kinsman George Douglas, 1st Earl of Angus, Thomas Dunbar, 5th Earl of Moray and Murdoch of Fife. Douglas himself was captured having been wounded five times, including the loss of an eye. This wounding was {{despite the fact that it}} is alleged Douglas' armour had taken three years in its construction.|$|E
