5|$|Cristina Kirchner is {{considered}} to be a populist leader and, like other contemporary populists in Latin America, built a system of propaganda to legitimize her actions: the Relato K. This propaganda works around a number of usual themes: the glorification of the state to the detriment of the individual rights; use of conspiracy theories to explain mistakes as attacks from others; blaming neoliberalism for the poverty; and glorifying democracy in speeches while maintaining only the appearance of it (procedural democracy). The political world is divided in two halves, the people and those against the people, with the Kirchners described as the saviors of the people. Under this vision, the people are treated like a homogeneous group, with a unified collective will, that the leader interprets beyond the boundaries of parliaments and parties. Kirchnerite writer Ernesto Laclau considers this the perfect form of democracy. This division is used to justify the rejection of <b>those</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> being against the people, and to polarize the population. The problems caused by her policies, such as inflation, are always explained as the result of class conflict and imperialism. Economic activity is described as a zero-sum game, where any wealth is the result of the exploitation of someone else, which justifies economic interventionism. Kirchner's victory in the 2011 election was used to justify authoritarian policies, as those policies would be the general will; opposition and criticism was often described as antidemocratic or even as the plotting of a coup d'état. Laclau's vision of the people has been criticized by other writers because it left little room for opposition or criticism, and because the citizen is actually reduced to a mere spectator unable to contest government policies.|$|E

25|$|Pseudoscience {{consists}} of statements, beliefs, or {{practices that are}} claimed to be scientific and factual {{in the absence of}} evidence gathered and constrained by appropriate scientific methods. Pseudoscience is often characterized by the following: contradictory, exaggerated or unfalsifiable claims; reliance on confirmation bias rather than rigorous attempts at refutation; lack of openness to evaluation by other experts; and absence of systematic practices when developing theories. The term pseudoscience is often considered pejorative because it suggests something is being presented as science inaccurately or even deceptively. <b>Those</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> practicing or advocating pseudoscience often dispute the characterization.|$|E

2500|$|The late 1960s saw the old {{tensions}} {{boil over}} into an eruption {{of violence in}} Northern Ireland. Haughey was generally seen as coming from the pragmatist wing of the party, and was not believed to have strong opinions on the matter, despite having family links with Derry. Indeed, many presumed {{that he had a}} strong antipathy to physical force Irish republicanism; during his period as Minister for Justice he had followed a tough anti-IRA line, including using internment without trial against the IRA. The hawks in the cabinet were seen as Kevin Boland and Neil Blaney, both sons of founding fathers in the party with strong Old IRA pasts. Blaney was also a TD for Donegal; a staunchly Republican area which bordered Derry. They were opposed by <b>those</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> the [...] "doves" [...] of the cabinet; Tánaiste Erskine Childers, George Colley and Patrick Hillery. A fund of £100,000 was set up to give to the Nationalist people in the form of aid. Haughey as Finance Minister would have {{a central role in the}} management of this fund.|$|E

5000|$|Survey {{research}} suggests that believers do tend to hold different views than non-believers {{on a variety of}} social, ethical and moral questions. According to a 2003 survey conducted in the United States by The Barna Group, <b>those</b> who <b>described</b> themselves <b>as</b> believers were less likely than <b>those</b> <b>describing</b> themselves <b>as</b> atheists or agnostics to consider the following behaviors morally acceptable: cohabitating with someone of the opposite sex outside of marriage, enjoying sexual fantasies, having an abortion, sexual relationships outside of marriage, gambling, looking at pictures of nudity or explicit sexual behavior, getting drunk, and [...] "having a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex." ...|$|R

50|$|Among several Eritrean {{opposition}} groups, Dr. Selassie {{is viewed}} as a force for progressive change, free speech, and an alternative to the government of Isaias Afewerki in Eritrea.

5000|$|Persons who {{are closely}} related to peers are also more {{correctly}} <b>described</b> <b>as</b> gentry than as nobility, since the latter term, in the modern British Isles, is synonymous with [...] "peer". However, this popular usage of 'nobility' omits the distinction between titled and untitled nobility. The titled nobility in Britain are the peers of the realm, whereas the untitled nobility comprise <b>those</b> here <b>described</b> <b>as</b> gentry.|$|R

5000|$|Nematoctonus (the name {{of which}} means 'nematode murderer') was a genus of fungi in the Pleurotaceae family, {{which is now}} {{considered}} a synonym of Hohenbuehelia. Originally the generic name —an anamorphic form of Hohenbuehelia—has a widespread distribution and contains 16 species. [...] Under the one fungus - one name convention, the correct name for the group is Hohenbuehelia and species where the fruitbodies have not been discovered or that are older names for <b>those</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> fruitbodies have all been transferred to Hohenbuehelia.|$|E
50|$|Allium sphaerocephalon {{produces}} egg-shaped bulbs. Small bulblets {{are present}} under the outer {{layer of the}} stem (making the plant potentially invasive when grown in gardens). Flowers are borne on a scape up to 50 cm in height, in a spherical to egg-shaped umbel, 1-6 cm in diameter, tightly packed with many flowers crowded together. The relatively small size of the umbel relative to {{the height of the}} stem makes this one of <b>those</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> 'drumstick alliums'. Individual flowers are reddish-purple and are occasionally replaced by bulbils (again making this a potentially invasive species).|$|E
5000|$|The {{portrait}} of Campbell is recorded {{as having been}} donated to the Mitchell Library in 1938 by E. Knowles. The second eldest daughter, also named Caroline, married Louis William Knowles so {{this appears to be}} a relative. This portrait also has some historical interest. In 1829 before the couple came to Australia it was in an Exhibition of the Royal Academy. Listed as a Portrait of Campbell Riddell Esq by J. Partridge it was favourably mentioned and was one of <b>those</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "very clever portrait".|$|E
5000|$|The name {{is taken}} from the star Antares in the {{constellation}} Scorpius. The genus name was created in 1984 by Wells and Wellington in a revision of Children's pythons, <b>those</b> previously <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a single species in the genus Liasis. Despite a petition to suppress the taxonomic work of these authors, it gained wide acceptance and publication in 1991.|$|R
5000|$|An October 20 poll {{commissioned}} by KING-TV and conducted by SurveyUSA showed Joe Mallahan ahead with 43% to Michael McGinn's 36% with {{a margin of}} error of 4.1%. Mallahan held a lead among college graduates, Democrats, Republicans, Independents and <b>those</b> <b>describing</b> themselves <b>as</b> moderates and conservatives. McGinn was shown to hold a lead among Asian-Americans, younger voters and <b>those</b> that <b>describe</b> themselves <b>as</b> liberals. McGinn changed his position on the Deep Bore Tunnel that same day with following statement, [...] "If I'm elected mayor, though I disagree with this decision, it will be my job to uphold and execute this agreement," [...] McGinn said. [...] "It is not the mayor's job to withhold the cooperation of city government in executing this agreement." [...] It was enough to push McGinn ahead of Mallahan by election day.|$|R
5000|$|... “West Brit” came to {{prominence}} in the land struggle of the 1880s. D. P.

It was synonymous with <b>those</b> he <b>described</b> <b>as</b> “Sourfaces”, who mourned {{the death of the}} Queen Victoria. It included virtually all Church of Ireland Protestants and those Catholics who did not measure up to his definition of “Irish Irelanders”.|$|R
