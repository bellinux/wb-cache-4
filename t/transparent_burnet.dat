50|$|Notable insects present {{include the}} {{butterfly}} the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), brown hairstreak (Thecla betulae), marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) and wood white (Leptidea sinapis); the moths, the burren green (Calamia tridens), Irish annulet (Odontognophos dumetata) and <b>transparent</b> <b>burnet</b> (Zygaena purpuralis); and the hoverfly Doros profuges.|$|E
50|$|Scottish National Heritage has {{designated}} Talisker as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The designation {{is based}} in part on Talisker's geological features (described above), but in part also on the presence of two rare species of Zygaenidae, the Talisker burnet moth and the <b>transparent</b> <b>burnet</b> moth.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the more}} than 30 species of {{butterflies}} and moths found in Ireland only two are not present in The Burren. Notable insects present in The Burren include the butterflies the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), brown hairstreak (Thecla betulae), marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) and wood white (Leptidea sinapis); the moths, the Burren green (Calamia tridens, which is only present in Ireland in this area), Irish annulet (Gnophos dumetata) and <b>transparent</b> <b>burnet</b> (Zygaena purpuralis); the hoverfly Doros profuges and the water-beetle Ochthebius nilssoni. This last species is known from just five sites in the world, its type locality in northern Sweden and four marl lakes in The Burren.|$|E
50|$|The island {{supports}} arctic, Mediterranean and alpine plants side by side, due to {{the unusual}} environment. Like the Burren, the Aran islands {{are known for their}} unusual assemblage of plants and animals.The grikes (crevices) provide moist shelter, thus supporting a wide range of plants including dwarf shrubs. Where the surface of the pavement is shattered into gravel, many of the hardier Arctic or alpine plants can be found. But when the limestone pavement is covered by a thin layer of soil, patches of grass are seen, interspersed with plants like the gentian and orchids.Insects present include the butterfly the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), brown hairstreak (Thecla betulae), marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) and wood white (Leptidea sinapis); the moths, the burren green (Calamia tridens), Irish annulet (Gnophos dumetata) and <b>transparent</b> <b>burnet</b> (Zygaena purpuralis); and the hoverfly Doros profuges.|$|E
