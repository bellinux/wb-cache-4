25|$|Holy Week in the Christian year is {{the week}} {{immediately}} before Easter. The earliest allusion to the custom of marking <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>as</b> a whole with special observances {{is to be found}} in the Apostolical Constitutions (v. 18, 19), dating from the latter half of the 3rd century and 4th century. In this text, abstinence from flesh is commanded for all the days, while for the Friday and Saturday an absolute fast is commanded. Dionysius Alexandrinus in his canonical epistle (AD 260), refers to the 91 fasting days implying that the observance of them had already become an established usage in his time.|$|E
500|$|... "Helping Hand" [...] {{received}} overwhelming positive reviews. Of the episode, Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic said, [...] "As I'm {{realizing how}} much I'm thoroughly enjoying the characters on Body of Proof, [...] "Helping Hand" [...] has Megan finally noticing how little she knows about them. The best part is, she does something {{to try and}} change that {{and the results are}} both comical and touching". Orlando praised the scenes between Megan and Curtis, calling them [...] "great" [...] and saying, [...] "Nothing makes you a part of the team like falling for a well-meaning office prank". On the Megan and Bud scenes she said that Megan was [...] "sweet" [...] and [...] "funny" [...] but called her attempts at consoling Bud [...] "clumsy", adding; [...] "Neither completely trusts the other but their growing professional respect has the potential to also become a personal friendship". On this, she said that Bud had some of the best lines in the episode, calling them [...] "the best". She hoped that Peter and Megan's relationship will be explored further and wanted to know [...] "just how these two became partners". Finally, she was glad it was not too [...] "gory" [...] and summarized, [...] "On Body of Proof I'm more interested in the characters than the graphic medical details. Thankfully they continue to give me plenty of what I want". TV OverMind Carissa Pavlica said she was [...] "really enjoying" [...] the relationship between Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) and Megan. Pavlica explained, [...] "In the Pilot, the other medical examiners seemed to hope they could somehow get rid of Megan by tattling on things to Kate. <b>This</b> <b>week,</b> <b>as</b> she saw Megan struggle in her connection with the living, she attempted to reach out and give advice". Of the plot of the episode, Pavlica said; ...|$|E

2500|$|Romney opposes {{legalization of}} {{marijuana}} for medicinal use {{at both the}} state and federal level. He told attendees at a town hall forum in 2007, “I have the same position <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>as</b> I had last week: If you elect me President, I'm not going to allow legalization of marijuana. I'm going to fight it tooth and nail." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode an [...] "A", calling {{it one of}} his [...] "favorite kind of Adventure Time episode" [...] because it is [...] "a metaphor that speaks to the {{difficulty}} of growing up while embracing the unbridled fun of being a kid." [...] Sava complimented the fact that the series was willing to deal with subjects such as puberty and sexuality in dreams. He was also complimentary towards the climactic battle between Flame Princess and Ice King, describing it as a [...] "Kaiju Flame Princess vs. Kaiju Ice King battle". Ultimately, Sava concluded that the episode is proof that [...] "Adventure Time isn’t afraid of changing its characters, and Finn has a major learning experience <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>as</b> he sabotages his relationship." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2013 {{interview}} with Martha Raddatz of ABC News, Greenwald said {{that members of}} Congress are being [...] "blocked" [...] from getting [...] "the most basic information about what NSA is doing... and what the FISA court has been doing....", and specifically referenced Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD), a ranking member of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence ("House Intelligence Committee"). Ruppersberger, who was a guest on the show, responded, [...] "We have rules {{as far as the}} committee and what you can have and what you cannot have. However, based on that, that statement I just made, is that since this incident occurred with Snowden, we've had three different hearings for members of our Democratic Caucus, and the Republican Caucus.... And we will continue to do that because what we're trying to do now is to get the American public to know more about what's going on." [...] Rep. King, who was also a guest on <b>This</b> <b>Week</b> <b>as</b> a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, stated: [...] "o me it's unprecedented to have all of these top people from an administration during this time of crisis still come in and answer question after question after question. So anyone who says that Congress is somehow being stonewalled is just wrong and [...] is generally, I think, raised by {{people who are trying to}} make a name for themselves." ...|$|E

I'm sure I looked forward to <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>as</b> one of unmixed trouble and torment; but I was very wrong to do so. It has given me a great deal of unmixed satisfaction." ...|$|E

60|$|My dear Brown--I {{ought to}} be off {{at the end of}} <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>as</b> the cold winds begin to blow towards evening;--but I will wait till I have your answer to this. I am to be introduced, before I set out, to a Dr. Clark, a {{physician}} settled at Rome, who promises to befriend me in every way there. The sale of my book is very slow, though it has been very highly rated. One of the causes, I understand from different quarters, of the unpopularity of this new book, is the offence the ladies take at me. On thinking that matter over, I am certain that I have said nothing in a spirit to displease any woman I would care to please; but still {{there is a tendency to}} class women in my books with roses and sweetmeats,--they never see themselves dominant. I will say no more, but, waiting in anxiety for your answer, doff my hat, and make a purse as long as I can.|$|E
6000|$|Never, they said, {{had there}} been such a generous brother. The town was astir about this poor man's gifts to the lucky bride. There were rumours that among the {{articles}} was a silver coal-scuttle, but {{it proved to be}} a sugar-bowl in that pattern. Three bandboxes came for her to select from; somebody discovered who was on the watch, but may I be struck dead if more than one went back. Yesterday it was bonnets; to-day she is at Tilliedrum again, trying on her going-away dress. And she really was to go away in it, a noticeable thing, for in Thrums society, though they usually get a going-away dress, they are too canny to go away in it The local shops were not ignored, but the best of the trousseau came from London. [...] "That makes the second box <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>as</b> I'm a living sinner," [...] cries the lady on the watch again. When boxes arrived at the station Corp wheeled them up to Elspeth without so much as looking at the label.|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{it must be}} {{said that}} at Miss Marlett's school, by an unusual and {{inconsistent}} concession to comfort and saniitary principles, the elder girls were allowed to have fires in their bed-rooms at night, in winter. But seeing that these fires resembled the laughter of the wicked, inasmuch as they were brief-lived as the crackling of thorns under pots, the girls were driven to make predatory attacks on fuel wherever it could be found. Sometimes, one is sorry to say, they robbed each other's fireplaces, and concealed the coal in their pockets. But this conduct--resembling what is fabled of the natives of the Scilly Islands, that they [...] "eke out a precarious livelihood by taking in each other's washing"--led to strife and bickering; so that the Stoker for the week (as the girl appointed to collect these supplies was called) had to infringe a little on the secret household stores of Miss Marlett. <b>This</b> <b>week,</b> <b>as</b> it happened, Margaret Shields was the Stoker, and she so bore herself in her high office as to extort the admiration of the very housemaids.|$|E

60|$|I want {{to write}} you while I am here--and it helps me (thus putting pen to paper does) to conjure away the {{darkness}} of this black anniversary--just a little. I have been dreading this day--as I have been living through <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>as</b> you and Peg will have done, and Bill not less, {{under the shadow of}} all the memories and pangs of a year ago--but there is a strange (strange enough!) kind of weak anodyne of association in doing so here, where thanks to your support and unspeakable charity, utterly and entirely, I got sufficiently better of my own then deadly visitation of misery to struggle with you on to Nauheim. I met here at first on coming down a week--nine days--ago (quite fleeing from the hot and blighted Rye) the assault of all that miserable and yet in a way helpful vision--but have since been very glad I came, just as I am glad that you were here then--in spite of everything.... I am adding day to day here, as you see--partly because it helps to tide me over a bad--not physically bad--time, and partly because my admirable and more than ever wonderful hostess puts it so as a favour to her that I do, that I can only oblige her in memory of all her great goodness to us--when it did make such a difference--of May 1910. So I daresay I shall stay on for ten or twelve days more (I don't want to stir, for one thing, till we have had some relief by water. It has now rained in some places, but there has fallen as yet no drop here or hereabouts--and the earth is sickening to behold.) I have my old room--and I have paid a visit to yours--which is empty.... Mrs. Swynnerton is doing an historical picture for a decorative competition--the embellishment of the Chelsea Town Hall, I believe: Queen Elizabeth taking refuge (at Chelsea) under an oak during a thunder-storm, and she finds the great oak here and Mrs. Hunter, in a wonderful Tudor dress and headgear and red wig, to be admirably, though too beautifully, the Queen: with the big canvas set up, out of doors, by the tree, where her marvellous model still finds time, on top of everything, to pose, hooped and ruffled and decorated, and in a most trying queenly position. Mrs. S. is also doing--finishing--the portrait of me that she pushed on so last year.|$|E
