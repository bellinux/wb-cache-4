50|$|In 2005, {{the pacific}} <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> {{could be found}} in small {{population}} sizes along old-growth forests. Their small populations are scattered along the river, because of heightened water temperatures. These temperature highs are above the level for egg development during the summer when these frogs oviposit under stream substrates. The pacific <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> are also endangered, because they have morphological adaptations and biophysical constraints with temperatures so they’re ecologically dependent.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 To {{effectively}} manage for biodiversity at broad, ecosystem scales, {{the influences}} of habitat structure at multiple spatial scales on vertebrate species must be understood. There are few studies on the broad-scale habitat requirements of stream amphibians despite their importance in streams in forest ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) as predators and prey, and potentially as indicators of ecosystem health. In particular, studies {{on the influence of}} forest structure at landscape scales on stream amphibians are lacking. I examined stream amphibian-habitat relationships for Pacific giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus), larval and metamorphosed <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> (Ascaphus truei), and torrent salamanders (Rhyacotriton spp.) at four spatial scales (2 -m sample unit, intermediate, sub-drainage, and drainage). Over two field seasons (1998 and 1999), I captured 1, 568 amphibians in 702 sample units in 16 randomly chosen drainages in the Oregon Coast Range. I used an information theoretic approach of analysis to rank sets of a priori candidate models that described habitat relationships at each spatial scale. At the 2 -m sample unit scale, all species of interest were negatively associated with fine sediments and were positively associated with either stream width or elevation. At the intermediate spatial scale, Pacific giant salamanders, metamorphosed <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs,</b> and torrent salamanders were positively associated with the presence of a 150 -ft. forested band {{on each side of the}} stream, and larval <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> were positively associated with the presence of forest > 105 years old on at least one side of the stream. At the sub-drainage and drainage scales, all species were positively associated with the proportion of stream length in a sub-drainage or drainage with a 150 -ft. forested band on each side of the stream. Heat load index (aspect) was also important for Pacific giant salamanders and larval <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> at the intermediate and sub-drainage scales. Results at all spatial scales suggest that Pacific giant salamanders and larval <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> occur lower in the drainage network, and metamorphosed <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> and torrent salamanders occur higher in the drainage network. This study demonstrates the importance of examining headwater stream amphibian habitat at multiple spatial scales, provides insights on linkages between amphibian responses across spatial scales, and shows that broad-scale variables (e. g., the presence of forested bands or the percentage of stream length with forested bands) can be used to assess management approaches for stream amphibian communities. Geophysical characteristics such as stream aspect may also help identify areas that should not be harvested if protection of amphibian habitat is an objective...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> are {{two species}} of frogs in the genus Ascaphus, the only taxon in the family Ascaphidae [...] The [...] "tail" [...] in the name is {{actually}} {{an extension of the}} male cloaca. The tail is one of two distinctive anatomical features adapting the species to life in fast-flowing streams. These are the only North American frog species that reproduce by internal fertilization.|$|R
5000|$|The {{existence}} of the visible [...] "tail" [...] appendage makes this frog family distinct from all other frogs. Thus, its wider classification is difficult. It is usually classified in the Archaeobatrachia suborder of ancient frogs, though some say {{it should be a}} sister to all other frogs. The [...] "tail" [...] is found only in males, and is actually part of the cloaca, used to insert sperm into the female during mating. This anatomical feature improves breeding success by minimizing loss of sperm in the turbulent, fast-flowing streams inhabited by this species. Thus, the <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> exhibit internal fertilisation, rather than the external fertilisation found in other frogs.|$|R
500|$|With a few exceptions, frogs use {{external}} fertilisation. The male grasps {{the female}} tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or {{in front of}} the back legs, {{or in the case of}} Epipedobates tricolor, around the neck. They remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm. Roughened nuptial pads on the male's hands aid in retaining grip. Often the male collects and retains the egg mass, forming a sort of basket with the hind feet. An exception is the granular poison frog (Oophaga granulifera) where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously. The <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> (Ascaphus truei) exhibits internal fertilisation. The [...] "tail" [...] is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female. This frog lives in fast-flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs. The sperm may be retained in storage tubes attached to the oviduct until the following spring.|$|E

40|$|Stream {{ecosystems}} harbor many secretive and imperiled species, {{and studies}} of vertebrates in these systems face {{the challenges of}} relatively low detection rates and high costs. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has recently been confirmed as a sensitive and efficient tool for documenting aquatic vertebrates in wetlands and in a large river and canal system. However, {{it was unclear whether}} this tool could be used to detect low-density vertebrates in fast-moving streams where shed cells may travel rapidly away from their source. To evaluate the potential utility of eDNA techniques in stream systems, we designed targeted primers to amplify a short, species-specific DNA fragment for two secretive stream amphibian species in the northwestern region of the United States (Rocky Mountain <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs,</b> Ascaphus montanus, and Idaho giant salamanders, Dicamptodon aterrimus). We tested three DNA extraction and five PCR protocols to determine whether we could detect eDNA of these species in filtered water samples from five streams with varying densities of these species in central Idaho, USA. We successfully amplified and sequenced the targeted DNA regions for both species from stream water filter samples. We detected Idaho giant salamanders in all samples and Rocky Mountain <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> in four of five streams and found some indication that these species are more difficult to detect using eDNA in early spring than in early fall. While the sensitivity of this method across taxa remains to be determined, the use of eDNA could revolutionize surveys for rare and invasive stream species. With this study, the utility of eDNA techniques for detecting aquatic vertebrates has bee...|$|R

40|$|Prolactin (PRL) {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the juvenile hormone of anuran tadpoles and to counteract the effects of thyroid hormone (TH), the hormone that controls amphibian metamorphosis.

In this study, we show that overexpression of ovine or Xenopus laevis PRL in transgenic X. laevis does not prolong tadpole life, establishing that PRL does not {{play a role in the}} life cycle of amphibians that is equivalent to that of juvenile hormone in insect metamorphosis. However, overexpression of PRL produces <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> by reversing specifically some but not all of the programs of tail resorption and stimulating growth of fibroblasts in the tail.

40|$|We used a {{molecular}} genetic technique, the quantitative {{polymerase chain reaction}} (qPCR), to assess the occupancy of species (coastal <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> and Pacific giant salamanders) on Snoqualmie Pass. Traditional methods of detecting amphibians involve visual encounter surveys, trapping, or hand capturing. Detection can be challenging because amphibians are cryptic and can vary their use of habitat seasonally. Aquatic species shed DNA into the environment. Therefore, we used an environmental DNA (eDNA) approach to non-invasively detect amphibians at four sites on Snoqualmie Pass. For each site, we collected four replicate samples by filtering one liter of water for each and a distilled water control {{for a total of}} 20 samples. Then DNA was extracted and then quantitative PCR reactions conducted using species-specific primers for the mtDNA cytrochrome b gene.

40|$|Abstract Background Female sperm storage {{has evolved}} {{independently}} multiple times among vertebrates to control reproduction {{in response to}} the environment. In internally fertilising amphibians, female salamanders store sperm in cloacal spermathecae, whereas among anurans sperm storage in oviducts is known only in <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs.</b> Facilitated through extensive field sampling following historical observations we tested for sperm storing structures in the female urogenital tract of fossorial, tropical caecilian amphibians. Findings In the oviparous Ichthyophis cf. kohtaoensis, aggregated sperm were present in a distinct region of the posterior oviduct but not in the cloaca in six out of seven vitellogenic females prior to oviposition. Spermatozoa were found most abundantly between the mucosal folds. In relation to the reproductive status decreased amounts of sperm were present in gravid females compared to pre-ovulatory females. Sperm were absent in females past oviposition. Conclusions Our findings indicate short-term oviductal sperm storage in the oviparous Ichthyophis cf. kohtaoensis. We assume that in female caecilians exhibiting high levels of parental investment sperm storage has evolved in order to optimally coordinate reproductive events and to increase fitness. </p...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary and {{historical}} processes interact to structure genetic variation, however discerning between {{these can be}} difficult. Here, we analyze range-wide variation at 13 microsatellite loci in 2098 Rocky Mountain <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs,</b> Ascaphus montanus, collected from 117 streams across the species distribution in the Inland Northwest (INW) and interpret that variation in light of historical phylogeography, contemporary landscape genetics, and the reconstructed paleodistribution of the species.

Genetic structure has a strong spatial signature that is precisely congruent with a deep (~ 1. 8 MY) phylogeographic split in mtDNA when we partition populations into 2 clusters (K  =  2), and is congruent with refugia areas inferred from our paleorange reconstructions.

40|$|Extensive {{timber harvest}} has {{occurred}} over the last 100 years in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), resulting in {{a high proportion of}} early-successional forest and forest edge. Prior studies indicate that several PNW amphibian species are associated with habitat conditions found primarily in old-growth stands. However, it is unknown whether increasing amounts of forest edges in the PNW might further reduce the abundance and distribution of those amphibian species. In a recent study, USGS scientist Bruce Bury and collaborators at the University of Montana investigated the abundance of terrestrial and stream-dwelling amphibians on the interface of recent clearcuts and mature forest in the Siskiyou Mountains, southern Oregon. They assessed relative abundance of terrestrial amphibians on four clearcut-forest transects. The most frequent terrestrial species were ensatina and Del Norte salamanders. There were no statistically significant differences in abundance associated with distance to forest edge for either species. Large amounts of downed wood in the clearcuts may have ameliorated harvest effects. In contrast, they found that the abundance of larvae of <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> and Pacific giant salamanders in five headwater streams was markedly lower in clearcuts compared to mature forest stands downstream...|$|R
30|$|Population {{connectivity}} {{is often}} critical for recovery of stream species. There are several examples of fishes getting extirpated from stream reaches after wildfire, {{but in most}} cases they recolonize within one or two years, and populations recover to pre-fire levels within several years (Dunham et al. 2003). One important difference between stream fishes and amphibians is that recovery of many amphibians is expected to occur slowly. For example, experimental removal of Pacific giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus Baird and Girard) from stream reaches 25 m to 40 m long showed that recolonization from adjacent areas within streams could take up to 42 months (Ferguson 2000). Recent evidence also indicates that the amount of terrestrial versus aquatic dispersal could strongly influence connectivity and recolonization. Giant salamanders that are more closely tied to their streams (Cope’s giant salamander [Dicamptodon copei Nussbaum], Idaho giant salamander [Dicamptodon aterrimus Cope]) experience less gene flow among populations than the more terrestrial Pacific giant salamander (Steele et al. 2009, Mullen et al. 2010). <b>Tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> and torrent salamanders are likely weaker dispersers than Pacific giant salamanders and could take longer to recolonize habitats, or may experience reduced gene flow if wildfire makes the terrestrial environment less hospitable (Nijhuis and Kaplan 1998, Miller et al. 2006, Spear and Storfer 2008).|$|R

40|$|Timber {{harvest in}} the Pacific Northwest has {{resulted}} in a highly fragmented landscape, but there is no information on responses of amphibians to forest edges for this region. We investigated abundance of terrestrial and stream-dwelling amphibians on the interface of recent clearcuts and mature forest in the Siskiyou Mountains, Oregon, in summer and fall of 1998. We assessed relative abundance of terrestrial amphibians on four clearcut-forest transects with a combination of pitfall trapping and manual searches. Ensatinas and Del Norte salamanders, the most frequently recorded species, were found on all four sites. While we commonly captured ensatinas using both techniques, we caught most Del Norte salamanders during manual searches. For both species we found no differences in abundance associated with distance to forest edge. Lack of differences in salamander abundance among clearcut and adjacent forests may be related to large amounts of small woody debris that remained in the clearcuts. The abundance of larvae of <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> and Pacific giant salamanders in five headwater streams was markedly lower in clearcuts than in downstream mature forest stands. No obvious differences existed for stream habitat variables across transects, but abundance of metamorphosed individuals and recruitment may be reduced in clearcut areas due to hotter and drier conditions during the summer.
