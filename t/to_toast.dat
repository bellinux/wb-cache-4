25|$|The toaster is {{typically}} a small electric kitchen appliance designed <b>to</b> <b>toast</b> multiple types of bread {{products such as}} sliced bread, bagels, and English muffins. Although {{not the first to}} invent the toaster, the pop-up toaster was invented by Charles Strite in 1919, consisting of a variable timer and springs in order to prevent burnt toast. Strite received a patent for his invention on May 29, 1919.|$|E
25|$|The Scots Greys, {{along with}} certain other regiments of the British Army, handled the loyal toast differently. Since the Glorious Revolution, {{officers}} were required <b>to</b> <b>toast</b> {{the health of}} the reigning sovereign. Typically, this meant standing and giving a toast to the monarch. The Scots Greys, however, did not stand for the toast. It is said that this tradition of giving the loyal toast while seated started during the reign of George III. During his reign, George III would often dine with the regiment; however, because of his health, he was unable to stand during the toasts. Since he could not, he allowed the officers to remain seated during the loyal toasts.|$|E
25|$|At the 1993 Indianapolis 500, winner Emerson Fittipaldi, {{who owned}} and {{operated}} an orange grove, notoriously drank orange juice instead of milk during the televised winner's interview. He eventually relented and also drank from the milk bottle later in the post-race ceremonies after the broadcast was over, but the public relations damage had already been done. The snub led to Fittipaldi being booed at the next ChampCar race, the Milwaukee Mile, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the heart of dairy country, and by some, {{as late as the}} 2008 Indianapolis 500 in which he drove the pace car. In the 2016 Indianapolis 500, as a promotion, the track gave out commemorative bottles of milk to 100,000 attendees <b>to</b> <b>toast</b> the winner with milk after the race.|$|E

25|$|Peabody {{frequently}} entertained {{and provided}} letters of introduction for American businessmen visiting London, and became {{known for the}} Anglo-American dinners he hosted in honor of American diplomats and other worthies, and in celebration of the Fourth of July. In 1851, when the US Congress refused to support the American section at the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace, Peabody advanced £3000 to improve the exhibit and uphold {{the reputation of the}} United States. In 1854, he offended many of his American guests at a Fourth of July dinner when he chose <b>to</b> <b>toast</b> Queen Victoria before US President Franklin Pierce; Pierce's future successor, James Buchanan, then Ambassador to London, left in a huff. At around this time, Peabody began to suffer from rheumatoid arthritis and gout.|$|E

On August 30, 2013, The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Harry Connick, Jr. signed a deal to join the panel as the third judge and that Simon Fuller held a party the night before with all three judges on hand <b>to</b> <b>toast</b> the forthcoming announcement. On September 3, 2013, Lopez and Connick Jr. were officially announced as judges for this season along with the confirmation of Jackson being the new mentor.

It was also later reported that Idol alumni Adam Lambert and Chris Daughtry would be assisting Jackson in mentoring the contestants.|$|E

500|$|In 1953, Hobbs was knighted, {{the first}} {{professional}} cricketer {{to be so}} honoured. He was reluctant to accept and only did so when convinced {{that it was an}} honour to all professional cricketers, not just himself. In the same year, John Arlott formed the [...] "Master's Club", a group of Hobbs' friends who met regularly <b>to</b> <b>toast</b> him. Hobbs remained active into the 1960s, including working in his shop. By the late 1950s, Ada was wheelchair-bound and Hobbs {{spent most of his time}} caring for her. She died in March 1963. Hobbs' health began to fail shortly afterwards and he died on 21 December 1963 at the age of 81. He left £19,445 in his will and was buried in Hove Cemetery. A memorial service was held at Southwark Cathedral in February 1964.|$|E

500|$|On St George's Day in 1684 {{at around}} 10pm, an {{explosion}} in the magazine destroyed the interior of Clifford's Tower entirely. The official explanation was that the celebratory salute from the guns on the roof had set fire to parts of the woodwork, which later ignited the magazine. Most historians, however, believe the explosion was not accidental. At the time, it was common in the city <b>to</b> <b>toast</b> the potential demolition of the [...] "Minced Pie", as the castle was known to locals; suspiciously, some members of the garrison had moved their personal belongings to safety just before the explosion, and no-one from the garrison was injured by the event. The heat of the fire turned the limestone of the tower to its current, slightly pink, colour. The now-ruined tower was returned fully to private ownership, eventually forming part of the lands of the neighbouring house and gardens belonging to Samuel Waud.|$|E
500|$|Russula virescens is an edible {{mushroom}} {{considered to}} be one of the best of the genus Russula, and is popular in Europe, particularly in Spain. In an 1875 work on the uses of fungi, English mycologist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke remarked about the mushroom that [...] "the peasants about Milan are in the habit of putting [...] over wood embers <b>to</b> <b>toast,</b> and eating [...] afterwards with a little salt." [...] The mushroom is often sold as a dried product in Asia, and in China, it can be found in roadside markets. Its smell is not distinctive, but its taste has been described as mild, nutty, fruity, or even sweet. Old specimens may smell of herrings. Drying the mushrooms enhances the nutty flavor. Mushrooms can be sautéed (the green color disappears with cooking), and young specimens that are prepared this way have a potato taste that pairs well with shallots. They are also fried or grilled, or used raw in salads. [...] Young specimens are pale and can be hard to identify, but the characteristic pattern of older fruit bodies makes them hard to confuse with other species. When collecting R.virescens for consumption, caution is of vital importance to avoid confusion with the dangerously poisonous Amanita phalloides (known as the death cap), a mushroom that can be most easily identified by its volva and ring.|$|E
500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{decides to}} throw a garden party at Schrute Farms to impress his parents and Robert California (James Spader), and exhaustively {{explains}} party manners to the office workers. Andy is jealous {{at the amount of}} attention his younger brother Walter Bernard, Jr. (Josh Groban) receives from his father, and thinks that by throwing an elaborate party he can ensure his father's blessings. At first, the party goes along smoothly. Andy makes a toast to Robert in order to get his fellow employees <b>to</b> <b>toast</b> him, as if to show to his parents and California that he is valued by his employees. His plan backfires, however, and instead more people toast Robert. To get everybody's mind off of Robert, Andy decides to sing [...] "More Than Words" [...] as a duet with his father. This too goes awry as his father corrects his playing and singing, and ultimately decides to sing a duet with Walter Jr. instead of Andy. Upset, Andy takes his guitar and storms off. His father confronts him privately about his outburst, and when Andy admits to trying to win his father's affection, he reacts with annoyance. This conversation is overheard by the other staff on the baby monitor Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) brought for their daughter, and Pam quickly turns off the monitor to let Andy save face. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) confide to the camera that they now understand why Andy feels he needs to prove himself to everyone. After his family leaves, a dejected Andy, feeling unwanted by his family and co-workers, says goodbye to the office staff as they turn the garden party into a barbecue. Darryl and Oscar, however, convince Andy to stay with a cheeseburger and a beer.|$|E
