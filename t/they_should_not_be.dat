5|$|White dwarfs {{have low}} {{luminosity}} and therefore occupy a strip {{at the bottom}} of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, a graph of stellar luminosity versus color (or temperature). <b>They</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> confused with low-luminosity objects at the low-mass end of the main sequence, such as the hydrogen-fusing red dwarfs, whose cores are supported in part by thermal pressure, or the even lower-temperature brown dwarfs.|$|E

She cautions that children may even <b>be</b> deprived <b>should</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> <b>not</b> exposed to them.

5|$|Dewi Zephaniah Phillips defended Wittgenstein's theory {{by arguing}} that {{although}} religious language games are autonomous, <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> treated as isolated because they make statements about secular events such as birth and death. Phillips argued that because of this connection, religions can still be criticised based on human experiences of these secular events. He maintained that religion cannot be denounced as wrong {{because it is not}} empirical.|$|E
5|$|Engine {{anti-ice}} {{was turned}} {{on for the}} two engines during taxi. The captain announced to passengers that the flaps would remain up during taxi, and <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> worried seeing them in the retracted position. He placed an empty coffee cup on the flap handle {{as a reminder of}} the position of the flaps, a procedure used by many flight crews. The captain told the first officer they would use standard USAir contaminated runway procedures that included the use of 18 degrees flaps, and also decided that they would take off with a reduced V1 speed of 110 knots.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Chia mooted {{the idea}} that Singaporeans {{should be able to}} borrow from their own Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings to tide over periods of {{financial}} difficulty. His rationale was that if individuals could borrow from their own CPF accounts to buy depreciating property and money-losing stocks, there was no reason why <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> allowed to do so to pay for bills. Dr. Ong Seh Hong, MP for Aljunied GRC, opposed the view, stating that it was important and for the good of Singapore that Singaporeans were independent individuals who could assume the risks and successes of their investments and be self-sufficient.|$|E

500|$|On 10 January, one {{of their}} lawyers, Manohar Lal Sharma, said in a media {{interview}} that the victims {{were responsible for the}} assault because <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> using public transportation and, as an unmarried couple, <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> on the streets at night. He went on to say: [...] "Until today I have not seen a single incident or example of rape with a respected lady. Even an underworld don would not like to touch a girl with respect." [...] He also called the male victim [...] "wholly responsible" [...] for the incident because he [...] "failed in his duty to protect the woman".|$|R
5|$|Powers {{of search}} and seizure are covered by Section 3, which also {{repealed}} the Obscene Publications Act 1857. This section allows a Justice of the Peace, if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe obscene publications are kept on certain premises for profit, to issue a warrant for that location. This warrant allows a police officer to enter the premises, search them and remove any suspect publications; if such publications are found, the officer can also take records relating to the businesses trade. The articles must then be brought before a magistrate and either forfeited by the owners or returned. The owner, author or publisher of the articles, or the person from whom they were seized, may appear before the magistrate to argue why <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> forfeited.|$|E
5|$|Scholar-officials {{who entered}} civil service through {{examinations}} acted as executive officials {{to a much}} larger body of non-ranked personnel called lesser functionaries. They outnumbered officials by four to one; Charles Hucker estimates that they were {{perhaps as many as}} 100,000 throughout the empire. These lesser functionaries performed clerical and technical tasks for government agencies. Yet <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> confused with lowly lictors, runners, and bearers; lesser functionaries were given periodic merit evaluations like officials and after nine years of service might be accepted into a low civil service rank. The one great advantage of the lesser functionaries over officials was that officials were periodically rotated and assigned to different regional posts and had to rely on the good service and cooperation of the local lesser functionaries.|$|E
5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} (or {{phospholipid}} bilayer) {{is a thin}} polar membrane made of two layers of lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell membranes of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be.</b> Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, {{even though they are}} only a few nanometers in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps.|$|E

5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} start {{painting}} her mural in the warehouse, {{but has a}} hard time getting started as she is afraid of it not being perfect. Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the complaints are already in the computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses them to build a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper meaning for the employees when Pete points out that it is composed of failures made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> ashamed of their failures. They decide {{to try to make it}} go all the way to the ceiling, but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a blank card as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and hangs up. The client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over getting that last complaint and disappointed over losing a client. After celebrating the completion of the card tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what others think, further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E

25|$|Head {{and neck}} markers are very visible, {{and may be}} used in species where the legs are not {{normally}} visible (such as ducks and geese). Nasal discs and nasal saddles can be attached to the culmen with a pin looped through the nostrils in birds with perforate nostrils. <b>They</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> used if they obstruct breathing. <b>They</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> used on birds that live in icy climates, as accumulation of ice on a nasal saddle can plug the nostrils. Neck collars made of expandable, non-heat-conducting plastic are very useful for larger birds such as geese.|$|E
