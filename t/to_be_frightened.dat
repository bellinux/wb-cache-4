25|$|Initially, the Romani were herded into {{so called}} ghettos, {{including}} the Warsaw Ghetto (April–June 1942), where {{they formed a}} distinct class {{in relation to the}} Jews. Ghetto diarist Emmanuel Ringelblum speculated that Romani were sent to the Warsaw Ghetto because the Germans wanted:...to toss into the Ghetto everything that is characteristically dirty, shabby, bizarre, of which one ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>frightened,</b> and which anyway has to be destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Underneath the bay on the {{far left}} is the bronze statue of Perseus by Benvenuto Cellini. It shows the mythical Greek hero holding his sword in his right hand and holding up the Medusa's severed head in his left. The well-proportioned muscular body of Perseus stands poised on the right leg. Perseus is {{reflecting}} and he seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>frightened</b> by his same action. Blood is gushing from the head and the neck of the dead Medusa. The richly decorated marble pedestal, also by Cellini, shows four graceful bronze statuettes of Jupiter, Mercurius, Minerva and Danaë. The bas-relief on the pedestal, representing Perseus freeing Andromeda, is a copy of the one in Bargello.|$|E

25|$|During {{the last}} few years of his rule in Tuscany, Leopold had begun <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>frightened</b> by the {{increasing}} disorders in the German and Hungarian dominions of his family, which were the direct result of his brother's strict methods. He and Joseph II were tenderly attached to one another and met frequently {{both before and after the}} death of their mother. The portrait by Pompeo Batoni in which they appear together shows that they bore a strong personal resemblance to one another. But it may be said of Leopold, as of Fontenelle, that his heart was made of brains. He knew that he had to succeed his childless eldest brother in Austria, and he was unwilling to inherit his unpopularity. When, therefore, in 1789 Joseph, who knew himself to be dying, asked him to come to Vienna and become co-regent, Leopold evaded the request.|$|E
500|$|Although The Marble Index was {{generally}} unnoticed {{when it was}} released, it was praised by the countercultural East Village Other and International Times; however, most critics found [...] "her desolate soundscapes inaccessible." [...] Anne Marie Micklo of Rolling Stone gave the album a positive review, calling side two [...] "a really worthwhile venture into musical infinity". A cult following emerged around it, which included music journalist Lester Bangs, who wrote in a 1978 article entitled [...] "Your Shadow Is Scared of You: An Attempt Not <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Frightened</b> by Nico": [...] "The Marble Index is the greatest piece of 'avant-garde classical', 'serious' music of {{the last half of}} the 20th century so far." [...] Although Bangs praised the album, he also wrote that it [...] "scared the shit out of [...] " [...] and described the listening experience as [...] "self-torture".|$|E
500|$|Several {{songs and}} {{scenes from the}} show address racial issues.

At the end of his song, he tells the tribe that the [...] "boogie man" [...] will get them, as the tribe pretends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>frightened.</b> [...] "Dead End", sung by black tribe members, is a list of street signs that symbolize black frustration and alienation. One of the tribe's protest chants is [...] "What do we think is really great? To bomb, lynch and segregate!" [...] "Black Boys/White Boys" [...] is an exuberant acknowledgement of miscegenation; the U.S. Supreme Court had struck down laws against the practice in 1967.

500|$|In their {{analysis}} of the case, the journalists Simon Freeman and Barry Penrose state that Thorpe probably formed {{the outline of a}} plan to silence Scott early in 1974, after the latter's re-emergence became a matter of increasing concern. Holmes later said that Thorpe was insistent that Scott be killed: [...] " [...] he would never be safe with that man around". Uncertain how to proceed, late in 1974 Holmes approached a business acquaintance, a carpet salesman named John Le Mesurier (not {{to be confused with the}} actor of that name). Le Mesurier introduced Holmes to George Deakin, a fruit machine salesman who, he thought, would have contacts with people who might be prepared to deal with Scott. Holmes and Le Mesurier concocted a story involving a blackmailer who needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>frightened</b> off; Deakin agreed to help. In February 1975 Deakin met Andrew Newton, an airline pilot, who said he was willing to deal with Scott for an appropriate fee—between £5,000 and £10,000 was suggested. Deakin put Newton in touch with Holmes. Newton always said that he had been hired to kill, not frighten, citing the size of the fee that he was offered—too much, he said, simply to scare someone.|$|E
500|$|... "Dead Celebrities" [...] makes {{frequent}} {{mention of}} the Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant chain, describing the food as extremely tasty, but claiming it resulted in bloody stool. Shortly after the episode first aired, a Chipotle spokesperson said via a Twitter message that the claim was false. In the episode's commentary, Trey Parker and Matt Stone admitted that they loved Chipotle, but found it funnier to use a restaurant with a healthy reputation rather than a place like McDonald's or Taco Bell. Ike's ability to see the spirits of dead celebrities serves as a parody of the 1999 thriller film The Sixth Sense, which stars Haley Joel Osment {{as a young boy}} who can see ghosts. Ike's line, [...] "I see dead celebrities", is a reference to that film's most famous line, [...] "I see dead people." [...] The old lady psychic with a very high-pitched voice is a reference to the character played by Zelda Rubinstein in the 1982 horror film, Poltergeist. Another film reference is made to The Exorcist when the medium is flung from the window. [...] "Dead Celebrities" [...] also mocks the Syfy reality television series Ghost Hunters by featuring the show's stars attempting to contact the celebrity spirits, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>frightened</b> and run away. Finally, the episode also parodies children's beauty pageants and the tendency of stage mothers to become unhealthily obsessed with their children winning such contests.|$|E
500|$|Eaton's combat {{career began}} inauspiciously, {{when he was}} shot down three times in the space of ten days. On the first occasion, his P-40 Kittyhawk was hit by 20mm cannon shells from an enemy fighter that he never saw. He later recalled, [...] "I was too busy getting the kite down <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>frightened.</b> But my God was I surprised." [...] Eaton brought his {{crippled}} aircraft in for a forced landing at El Hamma—in the midst of a tank battle between German and New Zealand forces. After the fighting had died down he made his way over to the New Zealanders, who gave him a lift back to his air base. The second time he was shot down, his plane was struck by 88mm anti-aircraft fire, necessitating another crash landing, this time behind enemy lines. Sympathetic Arab tribesmen smuggled him past the Germans and back to his airfield. Two days later, his P-40 was hit by fire from an Me109 that dived at him from out of the sun. He was able to glide back to base, [...] away, but on arriving found that it was under attack by German bombers. He decided he had no other option than to land the damaged plane among the exploding bombs, and managed to do so without mishap. His series of narrow escapes engendered a spirit of fatalism, and a habit of keeping his emotions severely in check while on duty: [...] "I just couldn't see myself living when so many were dying. It was something which, at the time, didn't bear much dwelling on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cornelius was {{relatively}} conservative in his musical tastes and was admittedly {{not a fan}} of the emerging hip hop genre, believing that the genre did not reflect positively on African-American culture (one of his stated goals for the series). Even though Cornelius would feature rap artists on Soul Train frequently during the 1980s, he publicly would admit (to the artists' faces such as Kurtis Blow) that the genre was one that he did not understand; as rap continued to move further toward hardcore hip hop, Cornelius would admit <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>frightened</b> by the antics of groups such as Public Enemy. Rosie Perez testified in the 2010 VH1 documentary Soul Train: The Hippest Trip in America that Cornelius also disliked seeing the show's dancers perform sexually suggestive [...] "East Coast" [...] dance moves. Cornelius admittedly had rap artists on the show only because the genre was becoming popular among his African-American audience, though the decision alienated middle-aged, more affluent African Americans like himself. This disconnect (which was openly mocked in an In Living Color sketch where Cornelius and the show were lampooned as extremely old and out of touch) eventually led to Cornelius's stepping down as host in the early 1990s and the show's losing its influence.|$|E

Suddenly it became quite dark, a blast of wind from the open door blew out the flame of the candles which were lit in front of the iconostasis, there was a long clap of thunder, louder than before, and I suddenly saw a fiery ball flying from the window straight towards the head of the Emperor. The ball (it was of lightning) whirled around the floor, then passed the chandelier and flew out through the door into the park. My heart froze, I glanced at my grandfather– his face was completely calm. He crossed himself just as calmly as he had when the fiery ball had flown near us, and I felt that it was unseemly and not courageous <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>frightened</b> as I was. I felt that one had only to look at what was happening and believe in the mercy of God, as he, my grandfather, did. After the ball had passed through the whole church, and suddenly gone out through the door, I again looked at my grandfather. A faint smile was on his face, and he nodded his head at me.
