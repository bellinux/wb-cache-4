25|$|It was the Manx Government's {{position}} <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom {{had decided}} {{to participate in the}} euro, then it would be likely that the Island would also choose to participate. Primarily this was because most of the Island's trade is with the United Kingdom and other countries of Europe, and the break-up of the existing currency union with the UK would cause economic harm to the Island. There was also concern that the island's economy is not large enough to withstand attack by currency speculators if the Manx pound became a stand-alone free-floating currency.|$|E

25|$|At a White House Meeting on April 1, 1964 Secretary of State Dean Rusk {{claimed that}} the Ambassador to Brazil, Lincoln Gordon was not advising that the United States should support Brazil at the time. Despite the proclamation, {{the two men had}} {{previously}} agreed to provide Brazil support. Instead this declaration was intended to signal that the United States would not overtly support Brazil. This was {{due to the fact that}} Rusk was concerned <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States intervened in Brazil, that would provide Goulart with a reason to become opposed to the United States. However the rebel residents of Sao Paulo - referred to as the Paulistas - had asked the United States for aid, but had not requested specific items or funds.|$|E
25|$|Assad {{believed}} that Syria {{would have no}} chance in a war against Israel without Egyptian participation. He believed <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Arab Republic had not collapsed, the Arabs would already have liberated Palestine. For a war against Israel, Syria needed to establish another front. However, by this time Syria's relations with Egypt and Jordan were shaky at best. Planning for war began in 1971 with an agreement between Assad and Anwar Sadat. At the beginning, the renewed Egyptian–Syrian alliance was based upon the proposed Federation of Arab Republics (FAR), a federation initially encompassing Egypt, Libya, Sudan (which left soon after FAR's first summit) and Syria. Assad and Sadat used the FAR summits to plan war strategy, and by 1971 they had appointed Egyptian General Muhammad Sadiq supreme commander of both armies. From 1972 to 1973, the countries filled their arsenals and trained their armies. In a secret meeting of the Egyptian–Syrian Military Council from 21 to 23 August 1973, the two chiefs of staff (Syrian Yusuf Shakkur and Egyptian Sad al-Shazly) signed a document declaring their intention {{to go to war}} against Israel. During a meeting of Assad, Sadat and their respective defense ministers (Tlass and Hosni Mubarak) on 26–27 August, the two leaders decided to go to war together.|$|E
500|$|British foreign {{minister}} George Canning {{was concerned that}} {{in the event of}} a Spanish restoration in Latin America, his nation would lose the trade which it had gained there since the Spanish had been ousted. [...] In 1823, he proposed to the American minister to Great Britain, Richard Rush, that their two nations issue a joint statement against the retaking of the former Spanish colonies by force. [...] Rush asked for instructions from President James Monroe. The President consulted with his predecessors, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who favored the joint statement, as an alliance with Britain would protect the United States. [...] Nevertheless, Monroe's Secretary of State, future president John Quincy Adams, felt <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States was going to set forth its principles, it should speak for itself and not seem to be following the lead of powerful Britain. [...] Accordingly, Rush was instructed to decline the opportunity to enter into a joint statement, although he was to inform the British that the two nations agreed on most issues.|$|E

500|$|Athletic {{competition}} between the Soviet Union and United States had grown intense during the 1950s. Their opposing ideologies and interests in nations such as East and West Germany, China and North and South Korea created a delicate situation as the 1960 Winter Games approached. Of particular interest was {{the question of whether}} China would be allowed to participate. [...] Chinese athletes last competed at the 1952 Summer Games but had since withdrawn from the IOC due to a dispute over Taiwan's participation as a separate country. The United States supported Taiwan while the Soviet Union stood behind China. Given the fact that the 1960 Games were to be held in America, there was concern among IOC members that the United States would not allow China or any other Communist country to participate. In 1957 IOC president Avery Brundage, himself an American, announced <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States refused entry to any country recognized by the IOC, then they would revoke Squaw Valley's invitation to host the Games and he would resign the presidency. Bowing to international pressure, the United States allowed athletes from Communist countries to participate. China continued to demand that Taiwan be expelled from the IOC, demands that were refused until China broke off relations ending any hope that they would participate in 1960.|$|E
500|$|The coin {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from the nation's senators. In {{an interview with}} Associated Press columnist Suzanne Gamboa, Republican Senator Phil Gramm of Texas described United States currency as [...] "crummy". Gramm, {{who was one of}} the senators who voted for the bill containing the legislation that authorized it, praised the design of the Sacagawea dollar as being an improvement over the other coin designs then in production. Despite his praise of the design, Gramm condemned the Mint's approach to marketing the coin, stating <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States Mint were the Franklin Mint, they would be [...] "sued for deceptive advertisement." [...] He also noted his belief that the Mint had repeated the earlier mistakes of the Susan B. Anthony dollar by issuing a coin that was tailored to the requests of the vending machine industry rather than the average consumer. Texas Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison criticized both the Sacagawea design as well the coin's size in relation to the other coins in circulation at the time. Hutchison felt that the new coin lacked the necessary heft to easily distinguish it from the lower denominations, and that the dollar, as well as the other coins and currency then in circulation [...] "looks like play money." [...] Senators Mike DeWine of Ohio and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, Republican and Democrat respectively, praised the design and the distinctiveness of the golden color.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese Army and Navy {{had their}} own {{independent}} atomic-bomb programs and therefore the Japanese understood enough to know how very difficult building it would be. Therefore, many Japanese {{and in particular the}} military members of the government refused to believe <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States had built an atomic bomb, and the Japanese military ordered their own independent tests to determine the cause of Hiroshima's destruction. Admiral Soemu Toyoda, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, argued <b>that</b> even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States had made one, they could not have many more. American strategists, having anticipated a reaction like Toyoda's, planned to drop a second bomb shortly after the first, to convince the Japanese that the U.S. had a large supply.|$|R

Roosevelt also placed an embargo on oil exports to Japan. Over 80% of Japan's need was being met through American imports, therefore on 31 July, the navy informed the Emperor that Japan's oil stockpiles {{would be completely}} depleted in two years.

2500|$|The operation, {{aimed at}} {{taking control of}} the Suez Canal, Gaza, and parts of Sinai, was highly {{successful}} for the invaders from a military point of view, but was a disaster from a political point of view, resulting in international criticism and diplomatic pressure. Along with the Suez crisis, the United States was also dealing with the near-simultaneous Hungarian revolution. Vice President Richard Nixon later explained: [...] "We couldn't on one hand, complain about the Soviets intervening in Hungary and, on the other hand, approve of the British and the French picking that particular time to intervene against Nasser".

Many media outlets, including USA Today, Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, NPR, The Los Angeles Times, and MSNBC, cited the analysis in news and opinion articles.|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{power is}} a {{relatively}} familiar method of generating electricity in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, but <b>the</b> process remains controversial because of high-level radioactive waste.
