40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} characteristics affecting the technological and consumer’s properties of tobacco, tobacco products, including tobacco for hookah, is humidity. Methods for determining the moisture content in hookah tobacco do not exist. The review of literature on the existing methods for humidity determination of food and tobacco products has been carried. In order to adapt existing in tobacco industry methods for determining humidity in hookah tobacco their review has also been carried. The purpose of researches was studying the various drying regimes for obtaining objective information on humidity of tobacco for a hookah. Two temperature regimes of 95  °C and 105  °C with various drying duration has been studied. Statistical analysis of experimental data, confirming the accuracy of the experiments has been carried. It has discovered that curing duration at studies temperatures of hookah tobacco samples does not affect greatly the content determination, but temperature of curing affects greatly. Method of continuous drying at ambient temperature is considered to be the most accurate, and has been taken as a comparison. It was found that the experimental results of moisture content determination in hookah tobacco greatly differ from the comparison; this can be probably explained by the peculiarities of the composition of hookah tobacco. Hookah tobacco includes hot only <b>tobacco</b> <b>particles</b> but also honey, sugar beet molasses, volatile compounds (flavorings and glycerin). Glycerin is non-volatile at ambient temperature, but at higher temperatures it begins to evaporate rapidly.

40|$|This paper {{predicts the}} {{reductions}} in the indoor mass concentrations of particles attainable from use of filters in building supply airstreams and also from use of stand-alone fan-filter units. Filters with a wide efficiency range are considered. Predicted concentration reductions are provided for indoor-generated particles containing dust mite and cat allergen, for environmental <b>tobacco</b> smoke <b>particles,</b> and for outdoor-air fine mode particles. Additionally, this paper uses a simple model and available data to estimate the energy and total costs of the filtration options. Predicted reductions in cat and dust-mite allergen concentrations range from 20 % to 80 %. To obtain substantial, e. g., 50 %, reductions in indoor concentrations of these allergens, the rate of airflow through the filter {{must be at least}} a few indoor volumes per hour. Increasing filter efficiencies above approximately ASHRAE Dust Spot 65 % does not significantly reduce predicted indoor concentrations of these allergens. For environmental <b>tobacco</b> smoke <b>particles</b> and outdoor fine mode particles, calculations indicate that relatively large, e. g., 80 %, decreases in indoor concentrations are attainable with practical filter efficiencies and flow rates. Increasing the filter efficiency above ASHRAE 85 % results in only modest predicted incremental decreases in indoor concentration. Energy costs and total costs can be similar for filtration using filters {{with a wide range of}} efficiency ratings.

40|$|Deposition on indoor {{surfaces}} is {{an important}} removal mechanism for <b>tobacco</b> smoke <b>particles.</b> We report measurements of deposition rates of environmental <b>tobacco</b> smoke <b>particles</b> in a room-size chamber. The deposition rates were determined from the changes in measured concentrations by correcting {{for the effects of}} coagulation and ventilation. The air flow turbulent intensity parameter was determined independently by measuring the air velocities in the chamber. Particles with diameters smaller than 0. 25 {micro}m coagulate to form larger particles of sizes between 0. 25 - 0. 5 {micro}m. The effect of coagulation on the particles larger than 0. 5 {micro}m was found to be negligible. Comparison between our measurements and calculations using Crump and Seinfeld's theory showed smaller measured deposition rates for particles from 0. 1 to 0. 3 {micro}m in diameter and greater measured deposition rates for particles larger than 0. 6 {micro}m at three mixing intensities.

Using quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs) installed into the module, we were able to assess <b>tobacco</b> smoke <b>particle</b> deposition in real-time. We compared regional deposition across the module positions and doses delivered by six VC 10 s in four independent laboratories: two in the UK, one in Germany and one in China.

In order to elucidate the biological function of AvrLm 4 - 7 {{and understand the}} specificity of recognition by Rlm 4 and Rlm 7, the AvrLm 4 - 7 protein was produced in Pichia pastoris and its crystal structure was determined. It revealed the presence of four disulfide bridges, but no close structural analogs could be identified. A short stretch of amino acids in the C terminus of the protein, (R/N) (Y/F) (R/S) E(F/W), was well-conserved among AvrLm 4 - 7 homologs. Loss of recognition of AvrLm 4 - 7 by Rlm 4 {{is caused by the}} mutation of a single glycine to an arginine residue located in a loop of the protein. Loss of recognition by Rlm 7 is governed by more complex mutational patterns, including gene loss or drastic modifications of the protein structure. Three point mutations altered residues in the well-conserved C-terminal motif or close to the glycine involved in Rlm 4 -mediated recognition, resulting in the loss of Rlm 7 -mediated recognition.

An automatic multiple smoking machine was used to generate EC aerosols under controlled conditions. Using a dilution chamber, we targeted nicotine concentrations similar to that of exposure in a general indoor environment. The selected toxic compounds were extracted from EC aerosols into a solid or liquid phase and analyzed with chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. ResultsWe found that EC aerosols contained toxic compounds including nicotine, fine and nanoparticles, carbonyls, and some toxic VOCs such as benzene and toluene. Higher mass and number concentrations of aerosol particles were generated from tobacco-flavored ECs than from menthol-flavored ECs. ConclusionWe found that diluted machine-generated EC aerosols contain some pollutants. These findings are limited by the small number of ECs tested and the conditions of testing.

Moreover the arrangement of virus particles in these cells resembled that of a systemic virus infection. Cells in local lesions of Chenopodium amaranticolor contained large numbers of virus particles both as packets and in the loose arrangement characteristic of systemic infection. Neither the number of particles nor their arrangement was affected in this host by detaching the leaf or by changing the air temperature. It is suggested that there may be two types of localized virus infections, one of which produces virus in low concentration and is amenable to changes in virus concentration and arrangement as a result of environmental manipulation...|$|R
