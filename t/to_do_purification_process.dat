40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>Purification</b> of the Glutaminase enzyme {{produced}} from free cells of Erwinia species at flask level. Glutaminase can be isolated from a number of sources such as plants, animals and microorganisms. Glutaminase is an important enzyme that serves many functions. It plays a key role in the energy and nitrogen metabolism of mammalian cells. Glutaminase is very important food enzyme used in food industries for flavor enhancement. Glutaminase, in combination with or as an alternative to asparaginase could be of great significance in enzyme therapy for cancer especially acute lymphocytic leukemia. Glutaminase enzyme was produced from free cells of Erwinia under optimized conditions such as Temperature, pH, Time, Inducer concentrations etc. After production of Glutaminase enzyme, Partial purification of enzyme was done with Ammonium Sulphate precipitation method. After isolation, the Glutaminase enzyme was purified with Gel filtration Chromatography & Ion Exchange chromatography. After purification by both methods, Purified samples were analyzed for enzyme activity & protein content. Enzyme activity was determined by Nessler's method & protein content was determined by Bradford method. It was found that after purification of crude sample by both methods, Gel Filtration chromatography shows maximum enzyme activity and specific activity than the samples purified with Ion Exchange Chromatography. Also %age recovery (97. 59 %) & purification fold (1. 70) obtained was found maximum from the samples purified with Gel Filtration Chromatography. From above results it was concluded that Gel filtration method is Better method for the purification of Glutaminase enzyme than Ion exchange Chromatography...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the efficacy of <b>purification</b> <b>processes</b> at the Rand Water Zuikerbosch treatment plant near Vereeniging. Raw water is abstracted via a canal and gravity pipeline from the Vaal Dam (in the upper Vaal River) and purified to ensure it meets the stringent standards set for drinkable water. The first step was to determine the ecological status of the raw water and it was done by measuring chemical, physical and biological variables as well as to identify and enumerate the different algal groups that occur in the raw water. The turbidity of the raw water was low but the phosphorous and ortho–phosphate levels were high. The Cyanophyceae (blue–green bacteria) especially Anabaena species were dominant in the raw water for the duration of the study. Potential problems such as relatively high alkalinity, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total dissolved solids (TDS) as well as potentially hazardous chemicals such as cadmium and lead were observed in the raw water. The Zuikerbosch Water Treatment Plant (ZWTP) is a conventional water treatment plant which involves the following stages: coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, sand filtration and chlorination. The use of pre–treatment chemicals ensures better water quality and effective removal of particles from the water. Only five of the variables (methylisoborneol (MIB); geosmin; chlorophyll–a; chlorophyll– 665 and total organic carbon (TOC) were measured before filtration, after filtration and in the final water. Samples from the raw water, before and after filtration, as well as final water were collected weekly for a period of two years to measure the environmental variables as well as <b>to</b> <b>do</b> algal identification and enumeration. The <b>purification</b> <b>processes</b> at ZWTP were not able to remove MIB, geosmin, chlorophyll–a and TOC from the final water. Algal concentration was reduced but not totally removed by the <b>purification</b> <b>processes.</b> Although some variables were not totally removed by the <b>purification</b> <b>processes,</b> ZWTP produce potable water that complies with the Rand Water guidelines.
