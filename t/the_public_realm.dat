5|$|One {{day after}} the report was released, Metropolitan Herman {{resigned}} from his position as Metropolitan. That November, the OCA elected a new Primate at its 15th Annual All-American Council. Metropolitan Jonah (Paffhausen) was chosen because he had recently been appointed as a bishop (only 11 days prior) and was viewed to not be involved with the previous financial scandal. Metropolitan Jonah immediately took a strong stance against the previous scandal and became a very public metropolitan, seeking to repair damage done by the previous scandal and bring the OCA into <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>realm.</b> Metropolitan Jonah also sought to improve relations with non-Orthodox groups and especially sought to repair {{the relations between the}} OCA and traditional Anglican groups. He was invited twice to speak at the conference of the Anglican Church of North America, in 2009 and 2012.|$|E

25|$|Instead, {{scholars}} like Fish {{suggest that the}} humanities offer a unique kind of pleasure, a pleasure based on the common pursuit of knowledge (even if it is only disciplinary knowledge). Such pleasure contrasts with the increasing privatization of leisure and instant gratification characteristic of Western culture; it thus meets Jürgen Habermas' requirements for the disregard of social status and rational problematization of previously unquestioned areas necessary for an endeavor which {{takes place in the}} bourgeois public sphere. In this argument, then, only the academic pursuit of pleasure can provide a link between the private and <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>realm</b> in modern Western consumer society and strengthen that public sphere that, according to many theorists, is the foundation for modern democracy.|$|E
25|$|Women's {{suffrage}} {{was achieved}} in 1920, and early 20th century antifeminism was primarily focused on fighting this. Suffragists scoffed at antisuffragists. Anna Howard Shaw, {{president of the}} National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) from 1904 to 1915, presumed, perhaps unfairly, that the antisuffragists were merely working {{under the influence of}} male forces. Later historians tended to dismiss antisuffragists as subscribing to the model of domestic idealism, that a woman's place is in the home. This undermines and belittles the true power and numbers behind the antisuffrage movement, which was primarily led by women themselves. Arguments employed by antisuffragists {{at the turn of the}} century had less to do with a woman's place in the home as much as it had to do with a woman's proper place in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>realm.</b> In fact, leaders of the movement often encouraged other women to leave the home and participate in society. What they opposed was women participating in the political sphere.|$|E

25|$|Given lack of {{information}} on political preferences of his parents {{it is not clear}} whether Arellano inherited the Carlist outlook from his ancestors; it appears to be the case as most of the siblings got involved in Traditionalism. It is also neither known whether he was engaged in any of the three Traditionalist streams prior to their re-unification in the early 1930s. He is probably first noted as active within <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>realm</b> during the first electoral campaign of the Republic in 1931; engaged in Juventud Tradicionalista, he kept delivering harangues in favor of Carlist candidates in small locations like Sangüesa in Eastern Navarre. Already the following year he was recorded busy in Carlist propaganda beyond his native region, speaking at various meetings during Gran Setmana Tradicionalista in Catalonia. During that period he must have approached Tomás Domínguez Arévalo, the Carlist national political leader, 24 years his senior but native of Villafranca, just 9km away from Caparroso. When discussing the 1933 events scholars already refer to Arellano as Arévalo's protégé; indeed conde Rodezno remained Arellano's mentor for the next 20 years.|$|E

2500|$|In this sense, {{some have}} read Nietzsche as an anti-political thinker.

Early socialization through patriarchal sexual discipline is extended by the later socialization through the institutional architecturalization of our bodies. Thus the spirit of the father never dies, continuously living as it does in the building which was, is, and will be embodying, structuring, mastering, representing, and reproducing his ‘eternal’ and ‘universal’ presence as a patriarchal wisdom-body of power.” ...|$|E

2500|$|An early {{example of}} science {{emanating from the}} {{official}} institutions into <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>realm</b> was the British coffeehouse. With the establishment of coffeehouses, a new public forum for political, philosophical and scientific discourse was created. In the mid-16th century, coffeehouses cropped up around Oxford, where the academic community began {{to capitalize on the}} unregulated conversation that the coffeehouse allowed. The new social space began to be used by some scholars as a place to discuss science and experiments outside of the laboratory of the official institution. Coffeehouse patrons were only required to purchase a dish of coffee to participate, leaving the opportunity for many, regardless of financial means, to benefit from the conversation. Education was a central theme and some patrons began offering lessons and lectures to others. The chemist Peter Staehl provided chemistry lessons at Tilliard’s coffeehouse in the early 1660s. As coffeehouses developed in London, customers heard lectures on scientific subjects, such as astronomy and mathematics, for an exceedingly low price. [...] Notable Coffeehouse enthusiasts included John Aubrey, Robert Hooke, James Brydges, and Samuel Pepys.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to general support tasks, women possessed gender-specific abilities {{that allowed them}} to carry out clandestine tasks that would have proved difficult for men. [...] Though women used these capabilities in both the urban and rural arenas of the war, it was the nature of the urban dimension of the war that contained the highest concentration, both in number and frequency, of covert activities by females. [...] The best documented example of this is in the Battle of Algiers. [...] In this battle male FLN operatives, driven underground by the French, stayed out of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>realm,</b> avoiding detention and interrogation, while the women who helped to keep them hidden were able to move about freely and smuggle weapons and other sensitive materials {{as a result of their}} manipulation of personal appearance. [...] The manner in which women did this was twofold; first by the religious practice of wearing the veil, which the French saw as above suspicion, or, adopting a European appearance seeming to demonstrate their adherence to French values and way of life. Women like Djamila Bouhired, due to the incapacitation of men, were also charged with carrying out terrorist attacks ordered by FLN leadership and did so by again using changes in dress to their advantage.|$|E
2500|$|Describing the {{emergence}} of the public sphere in the 18th century, Jürgen Habermas noted that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>realm,</b> or sphere, originally was [...] "coextensive with public authority", while [...] "the private sphere comprised civil society in the narrower sense, that is to say, the realm of commodity exchange and of social labor". Whereas the [...] "sphere of public authority" [...] dealt with the state, or realm of the police, and the ruling class,or the feudal authorities (church, princes and nobility) the [...] "authentic 'public sphere, in a political sense, arose at that time from within the private realm, specifically, in connection with literary activities, the world of letters. This new public sphere spanned the public and the private realms, and [...] "through the vehicle of public opinion it put the state in touch with the needs of society". [...] "This area is conceptually distinct from the state: it [...] a site for the production and circulation of discourses that can in principle be critical of the state." [...] The public sphere [...] "is also distinct from the official economy; it is not an arena of market relations but rather one of the discursive relations, a theater for debating and deliberating rather than for buying and selling". These distinctions between [...] "state apparatuses, economic markets, and democratic associations...are essential to democratic theory". The people themselves came to see the public sphere as a regulatory institution against the authority of the state.
