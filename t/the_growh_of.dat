40|$|The {{mortality}} of pine seedling in nursery {{was caused by}} damping off. Damping off disease is caused by soil borne pathogenic fungus Fusarium subglutinans. To get an effective method in controlling the diseases, {{is important to understand}} the effectiveness of biocontrol agent Trichoderma harzianum. The purpose of this research was to comprehend the inhibition mechanism of T. harzianum against F. subglutinans and its effectiveness. The research methods include (1) in vitro application of T. harzianum with Green Fluorescent Protein [GFP] using dual culture method, and (2) in planta application by inoculating T. harzianum with GFP four days before F. subglutinans inoculation, inoculating T. harzianum and F. subglutinans at the same time, and inoculating of T. harzianum four days after F. subglutinans inoculation. The results of this research showed that Trichoderma harzianum is effective to inhibit the growth of F. subglutinans in planta. The mechanism of T. harzianum to inhibit <b>the</b> <b>growh</b> <b>of</b> F. subglutinans is by nutrient competition...|$|E
40|$|Dependence of {{precipitation}} hardening on {{the distance from}} specimen surface and effect of the surface layer on the fatigue strength of an Al- 1. 2 mass% Si alloy were studied by microhardness test, transmission electron microscopy and repeated tension fatigue test. Rate of age-hardening was slower {{in the vicinity of}} surface than in the interior of the specimen aged at 423 K after quenching from 853 K. The result of the electron microscopy was that the size ot Si precipitates formed in the vicinity of surface was smaller than in the interior of specimen aged for 6 ks at 423 K. This difference was considered to be caused by the effect of the surface as vacancy sinks which slowed down <b>the</b> <b>growh</b> <b>of</b> Si precipitates {{in the vicinity of the}} specimen surface. A specimen surface layer whose hardness was different from that of the specimen interior was formed at the vicinity of the surface when the specimen was aged at relatively low temperature such as 423 K.

40|$|TIn our {{previous}} study we demonstrated that {{high doses of}} ascorbic acid prolonged the survival of mice with experimental mammary carcinoma. In this work we studied, ussing the same model, pathohistological characteristics of the tumor and phenotypic changes of lymphocyte subsets in the spleen. Experiments were performed on CBA/H mice. <b>The</b> <b>growh</b> <b>of</b> experimental tumor was induced by injection of mammary adenocarcinoma cells intramuscularly at the femoral region of mice. The animals were divided into control group and three experimental groups (I, II and III). Mice from experimental groups were treated peroraly with 10, 100 and 1000 mg/kg body mass (b. m.) of ascorbic acid, respectively, whereas control mice received physiological saline. Mice were sacrified after 7, 14 and 21 days {{from the beginning of}} the experiment. Total tumor mass and its pathohistological characteristics, spleen mass and cellularity as well as relative and total numbers of T cells, B cells and T cell subsets (CD 4 + and CD 8 +) in the spleen, were analyzed. High doses of ascorbic acid decreased tumor mass, stimulated proliferation of fibroblasts and formation of capsula arround the tumor, induced tumor necrosis and increased the number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Changes of lymphocyte subsets and their numbers varied depending on the applied dose of ascorbic acid and the time elapsed following tumor induction. The most prominent changes, manifested by an increase in the number of CD 4 + T cells were observed on the 14 th day in II experimental group. Our results suggest that the beneficial effect of ascorbic acid on experimental tumorogenesis in our model was the consequence of its influence on the tumor and on the immune system...|$|E
40|$|In this experiment, {{the authors}} obserbed {{the effect of}} Pretiron (TSH) on the {{transplantation}} and growth of three kinds of trnsplantable tumors of animals. 1) Ehrlich Ascites Tumor Mice weighing approximately 20 g were used. All mice were transplanted with Ehrlich Ascites Tumor intraabdominally. Pretiron (TSH) was intramuscularly injected daily {{for the period of}} 23 days, beginning 3 days prior to the transplantation of tumor. In the Pretiron (TSH) treated group, the growth of free ascites tumor cells was markedly inhibited and the survival days of these mice were prolonged (20 - 50 days). In the ascites of this group of mice, the infiltration of numerous lymphocyte-like cells was recognized. On the other hand, the survival days of the control group of mice were less than 20 days and the marked growth of free ascites tumor cells was obserbed. 2) Fibrosarcoma 58. The growth of transplanted tumor in the Pretiron (TSH) treated group is moderately inhibited. In the tumor tissue of Pretiron treated group, the more maked infiltration of lymphocyte-like cells was seen than iu the control group. 3) Mammary Carcinoma in R Strin of Mice <b>The</b> <b>growh</b> <b>of</b> transplanted tumors of Pretiron (TSH) treated group was markedly inhibited and thelmajority of these tumors disappeared. Histologicaly, numerous lymphocyte-like cells was found to infiltrating in the stroma of the tumor tissues. On the contrary, in the control group, the transplanted tumors grew well in all mice. From these findings it is concluded that Pretiron (TSH) has an inhibitory action on these tumors. Although the mechanism of antitumor action of Pretiron (TSH) is unknown, it is interestinh that Pretiron (TSH) promotes the infiltration of lymphocyte-like cells in tumor tissues as obserbed in this experiment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: All known {{pyrimidine}} and pyrimidine-derived secondary producs {{originate from}} uracil or its precursor, uracil- 6 -carboxylic acid. The biosynthesis {{of these products}} has been suggested to be uracil detoxication mechanisms. The possible toxic effects of uracil on <b>the</b> germination and <b>growh</b> <b>of</b> Pisum sativum L. cultivar Meteor, Lathyrus tingitanus L. in which pyrimidine-derived secondary products occur naturally, and of Phaseolus aureus Roxb. and Glycine max (L.) Merr., in which these compouns do not occur, were examined. The {{results show that the}} germination and growth of the P. aureus and G. max seeds under investigation were considerably inhibited by exogenous uracil. The effect of uracil was obvious on the non-producer group of experimental plants, especially on G. max. However, there was not any noticeable effect of uracil either on P. sativum, or on L. tingitanus in the experimental periods of germination and growth. These results show that uracil accumulation is most probably toxic to plants and that the production of these pyrimidine-derived secondary compounds from uracil is therefore a detoxication mechanism...|$|R
40|$|To form meter-sized pre-planetesimals in protoplanetary discs, dust {{aggregates}} have {{to decouple}} {{from the gas}} at a distance far enough from the central star so they are not accreted. Dust grains are affected by gas drag, which results in a vertical settling towards the mid-plane, followed by radial migration. To {{have a better understanding}} of the influence of growth on the dust dynamics, we use a simple grain growth model to determine the dust distribution in observed discs. We implement a constant growth rate into a gas+dust hydrodynamics SPH code and vary <b>the</b> <b>growh</b> rate to study the resulting effect on dust distribution. The growth rate allows us to determine the relative importance between friction and growth. We show that depending on the growth rate, a range of dust distribution can result.
