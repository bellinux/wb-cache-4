5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E
5|$|Adam Michael Goldstein {{was born}} on March 30, 1973, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents, Andrea and Herbert – {{both of whom were}} Jewish – had been unable to {{conceive}} children naturally, and they had adopted Goldstein's older sister Lana a year before his birth. Goldstein's mother left her husband temporarily after she caught him having extramarital sex with a man. During this time she had an affair herself, and she found out she was pregnant with Adam after returning to her husband. While heavily pregnant, she discovered her husband had been adulterous a second <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> she angrily disclosed to him that he was not the biological father of her baby.|$|E

5|$|During the trip, Homer {{falls asleep}} and wakes up {{abruptly}} {{at the wheel}} of the truck due to taking a combination of pep pills and sleeping pills that he bought at a general store. He awakes to discover that the truck drove by itself with its Navitron Autodrive System. He informs other truck drivers, who inform him that he cannot let anyone know about the Autodrive system because it would make all truck drivers lose their jobs. However, Homer tells the passengers of a passing bus about the system, which causes an angry mob of truckers to go after Homer. But even after the Autodrive system ejects itself from Homer's semi, Homer is able to escape from the angry trucker mob. Homer and Bart arrive in Atlanta to finish Red's shipment on <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> commandeer a train full of napalm so they can return to Springfield.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the team's poor 2003 record, Johnson {{retained}} Edwards as head coach and extended his contract through 2007. With a healthy Pennington at quarterback, the Jets began their season at 5–0 for the first <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> lost two of their next three games. During the team's second meeting with the Bills, Pennington suffered a tear in his rotator cuff that caused him to miss three starts. Pennington returned in a 29–7 rout of the Houston Texans. The team struggled {{toward the end of}} the regular season, winning only one of its final four games. Despite a final-game loss to the St. Louis Rams, the Jets reached the playoffs. The team traveled to San Diego to play the Chargers in the wild card round and upset them 23–20 on a Doug Brien field goal in overtime. The win sent the Jets to the divisional round against the 15–1 Pittsburgh Steelers. The Jets again took their opponent to overtime, as Brien missed a field goal with two minutes remaining and the score tied. He missed a second field goal in overtime. Pittsburgh kicker Jeff Reed proved more accurate, and the Steelers beat the Jets, 20–17.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Las Vegas Strip {{shooting}} on the evening of October 1, 2017, approximately 300 people fleeing from the concert venue entered the airfield after breaking down the security fence surrounding McCarran while seeking shelter from the gunfire. Since they had entered an active airfield, airport officials suspended operations on 01L/19R and 01R/19L at 10:15p.m. local <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> shut down 08L/26R and 08R/26L one hour later. Airfield operations resumed at 12:40a.m. on October 2, and the security fence was repaired by 1:10a.m. During the suspension of operations, 25 flights were diverted to other airports in the region, primarily to Phoenix but also to Los Angeles, Ontario, Bullhead City, Salt Lake City, and Denver. Two bullets struck and damaged, but did not ignite, a large fuel tank {{on the grounds of the}} airport.|$|E
5|$|They {{dropped the}} tag team {{title to the}} CM Punk and Colt Cabana at ROH's Chicago-area debut, ROH Reborn: Stage Two, working in ROH {{for the first time}} as outward heels. At the next show, Round Robin Challenge III, the title {{switched}} three times among the teams in the round robin challenge, the Second City Saints (Punk and Cabana), the Briscoe Brothers, and the Prophecy team of Dan Maff and B.J. Whitmer. The Briscoes defeated Maff and Whitmer in the fourth match of the night to win the title for a second <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> lost it back to Punk and Cabana in the main event. The Brothers both participated in ROH's inaugural Survival of the Fittest tournament, with Mark going over Alex Shelley in his qualifier and Jay falling to Homicide. Mark did not, however, win the elimination final. After losing a two out of three falls tag team title match to Punk and Cabana at Death Before Dishonor II Part 1, ending that feud, they lost in separate singles matches to members of The Rottweilers the next night. Between that and their victory in tag team action at Testing the Limit, it is likely that a feud was planned between the Briscoes and the Rottweilers.|$|E
5|$|This {{species has}} a {{courtship}} flight conducted above the trees. The pair fly on a strongly oscillating path with one bird ascending {{while the other}} is descending, both calling constantly. After display, the birds land on a branch for a mating ritual which starts with locking bills, followed by the female hanging upside-down for a variable period of <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> copulation while the male holds the female's neck. The flight and mating rituals have been recorded for three-coloured and red-throated parrotfinches, and may be typical for the genus. The nest is built with fresh grass blades, and is domed with a side entrance. It is always hidden in thick foliage, but can be at any height from the ground. The normal clutch is four spherical whitish eggs. Chicks are naked and have pinkish skin; the distinctive gape has blue nodular spots technically termed as papillae or tubercles at {{the upper and lower}} corners, and the yellow palate has a ring of five black spots. Most young estrildid finches beg for food with their wings held against the side, but juvenile parrotfinches lift the wing on the side away from the feeding parent. This behaviour may restrict competition for food from other nestlings.|$|E

5|$|Charles {{turned down}} a new {{contract}} with Ebbsfleet to sign for newly promoted League Two club Stevenage on a two-year contract for a compensation fee on 18 May 2010. He made his Stevenage debut in the club's 3–1 home victory against Stockport, playing 78 minutes of the match. The following week, he started against Aldershot Town, but was taken off after 38 minutes after struggling with injury. Charles returned to the starting eleven on 18 September 2010, starting in a 0–0 draw against Torquay United, Stevenage's first clean sheet of 2010–11. He scored his first goal for the club in Stevenage's 1–1 draw with Milton Keynes Dons in an FA Cup first round replay in November 2010. Charles' goal came in the fifth minute of stoppage time, taking the match to extra <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> to a penalty shoot-out, which Stevenage won 7–6. Charles received a straight red card for a professional foul on John Johnson in Stevenage's 1–0 home loss to Northampton Town on 11 December 2010, just ten minutes after coming on as a substitute. He scored his second goal for Stevenage in the club's fourth round FA Cup tie against Championship team Reading, cutting inside and curling the ball past the outstretched arm of Adam Federici to restore parity in a match that Stevenage went on to lose 2–1. Charles scored his first league goal of 2010–11 with a shot from 12yards in Stevenage's 2–1 home win against Bradford City on 2 April 2011. He provided the assist for Joel Byrom's goal after flicking a right-wing cross in Stevenage's 2–0 play-off victory over Accrington Stanley, a match in which he also hit the crossbar with a strike from 30yards out. Charles started upfront for Stevenage in the 2011 League Two play-off Final, played at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011. Charles' pass through to John Mousinho resulted in the only goal of the match, as a 1–0 victory over Torquay United meant Stevenage were promoted to League One. He played 33 matches for Stevenage during 2010–11, scoring four goals.|$|E
