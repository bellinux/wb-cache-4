5|$|Gibson's Brigade {{continued}} south, waking the 37th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry. This unit fled in all directions, and Gibson's men did {{not need}} to shoot. This left the 36th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry, between Gibson's Brigade and General Johnson's headquarters at the McNeill house. The 36th offered the best resistance Gibson had faced so far, but the surprised Confederates were forced to retreat toward the McNeill farm. Near the McNeill house the men from the Confederate Baltimore Battery attempted to fire canister from their two guns, but the unit and guns were captured by the 8th Ohio Cavalry before they could be fired. General Johnson was nearly captured when his headquarters was partially surrounded by Union cavalry. He escaped out <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> jumped on a horse—racing south to the 8th Virginia Cavalry.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} three {{soldiers}} entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains {{and out of the}} second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy behind the rest of his team. Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into the room, to take cover. Much of the operation {{at the front of the}} embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video. As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards the back door of the embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, {{she sends}} Lauren {{a message and}} meets her outside the police station, looking rough, as she has been arrested for shoplifting. Whitney opts to live with Dot Branning (June Brown) instead of her close family, but Dot convinces her {{to move back to}} Ricky's. When Ryan returns from a holiday, he learns of Whitney's ordeal and urges her to go to the police and get tested for sexually transmitted infections. She says she is not ready to go to the police but agrees to the test, which shows she has a chlamydia infection. When Whitney starts a relationship with a man named Lee (Mitchell Hunt), it is revealed that he is a friend of Rob's, and when Whitney agrees to meet Lee by text, Rob takes control of Lee's mobile phone. She allows Rob to take her home but then tells him to wait outside while she escapes through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> hitches a lift to Southend-on-Sea with friends. She leaves him a voicemail message not knowing that he has followed her. He finds her in her hotel room and tells her how much he loves her, but when Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) comes in, Rob attacks him, so Whitney tells him to leave. Fatboy calls Ryan, who comes to Southend to look for Rob. When he finds him, they fight and fall {{over the edge of the}} pier. The next day, a body is recovered from the sea, and is later revealed to be Rob who has died. Whitney thinks Ryan may also be dead until he appears. She tells him she has told the police everything about Rob, including Ryan's fight with him, and Ryan tells Whitney he has to leave. They say an emotional farewell.|$|E

25|$|Frechette, in her {{harboring}} trial testimony, {{said that}} she told Dillinger {{that the police had}} showed up after speaking to Cummings. Upon hearing Van Meter firing at Coulter, Dillinger opened fire through the door with a Thompson submachine gun, sending Cummings scrambling for cover. Dillinger then stepped out and fired another burst at Cummings. Cummings shot back with a revolver, but quickly ran out of ammunition. He hit Dillinger in the left calf with one of his five shots. He then hastily retreated {{down the stairs to the}} front entrance. Once Cummings retreated, Dillinger and Frechette hurried down the stairs, exited through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> drove away in the Hudson.|$|E
25|$|The trams were {{originally}} constructed with an entrance through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> exit {{through the middle}} and front doors. The conductor was seated at the back and the passengers would enter a platform before passing by the conductor. This was opposite on the trailers, which had the entrance at the front. This allowed for a common boarding area, which had the psychological effect of encouraging passengers {{to a greater extent}} board the trailer. The vehicles were equipped with blinker doors. MBO consisted of double doors at the front and back, and a single door in the middle. The first two TO units had the same design, while the remaining trailers had only single exit doors. The vehicles were not built with compartments.|$|E
25|$|In the Battle of Germantown on 4 October 1777, Proctor's {{guns were}} {{commanded}} by Captain-Lieutenant Brewer and Lieutenants Barker and Ritter. During the fighting, British {{soldiers of the}} 40th Foot took refuge in the Chew House. Two of Proctor's guns and two captured 6-pound guns began firing at the house. They quickly blasted open the front doors, but unknown to the gunners, {{the front of the}} house was buttressed by two feet of stonework that resisted their round shot. The gunners also fired grapeshot at the second floor in an attempt to suppress the return fire. The 1st and 3rd New Jersey Regiments repeatedly tried to storm the building but they were driven off with heavy losses. During the action, four cannons from Brigadier General William Woodford's Virginia Brigade opened fire on the other side of the house, blowing open <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> causing much damage. Some cannonballs passed entirely through the house by the windows, causing the Americans to believe that the defenders had their own artillery. The British successfully defended the Chew House and were rescued when the American army retreated.|$|E

50|$|A {{modified}} version of the JA platform called JX debuted in 1996 as the Chrysler Sebring convertible. Changes for the JX were the removal of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> roof, stiffening <b>the</b> chassis to compensate for the loss of a solid top, and lengthening of the front and rear clips. The JX also had larger rear brake drums, ceramic brake pads, and a cooler thermostat to compensate for the increased weight of the reinforcements to the unibody. The available engines and transmissions are identical to that of the Chrysler Cirrus. Unlike the sedans, the convertibles were assembled in Mexico.|$|R
25|$|On March 2, 2002 Louisville Mayor David L. Armstrong fired Police Chief Gene Sherrard due to {{a banquet}} honoring {{officers}} for exceptional valor. Two officers being honored for facing immediate danger were controversial as to what constituted immediate danger to these officers. The suspect {{in the case of}} these two officers, Desmond Rudolph, had left the house the officers went to through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> went to a stolen vehicle. Rudolph, who was unarmed, attempted to drive off, but there are conflicting statements as to if the car was operable or not. The view of the policemen involved was that the car was operable and, believing they may be struck by the vehicle, constituted a danger to their lives, while the opposing view is that the policemen did not follow proper police procedure by failing to secure the rear exit and that the car was inoperable and did not pose any danger to the officers. Rudolph was shot by the two officers 22 times and Rudolph died from his wounds. After the firing of the chief of police, many Louisville policemen marched in front of Louisville City Hall to protest the firing of Sherrard and demanded the resignation of Mayor Armstrong.|$|E
500|$|Duchess is {{left alone}} before Ribby's fire, and discovers her ham and veal {{pie in the}} oven. [...] "Then I must have been eating MOUSE! ... No wonder I feel ill," [...] she muses. Knowing she cannot {{adequately}} explain her ham and veal pie to Ribby, she puts it outside the back door intending to sneak back and carry it home after she leaves for home. Ribby and Dr. Maggoty arrive and, after much fuss, Duchess takes her leave, {{only to find that}} the magpie (who has left by <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door)</b> <b>and</b> a couple of jackdaws have eaten her ham and veal pie.

500|$|By chance, Johnson {{and three}} of his men, Lieutenant Daniel Toler and Sergeants Love and Miller, were still awake and {{discussing}} tactics. [...] Mexican troops {{had been told that}} the house where Johnson was quartered was one of their targets, yet a lamp burned in the window, signalling that this was the home of a loyalist. [...] Out of an abundance of caution, a group of troops knocked on the door. [...] Before the Texians could open the door, they heard the gunfire from the town square. [...] Toler looked out a window and saw uniformed troops on the porch. [...] Without opening the door, he told the soldiers, in Spanish, that there were no troops there, but he would open the door momentarily. [...] The fighting moved into the street, and soldiers who had been guarding {{the back door of the}} house rushed around to the front. [...] Johnson, Toler, Love, and Miller dashed out <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> escaped.|$|E

500|$|On January 1, 1923, the Taylors' {{neighbor}} {{reported that}} she heard a scream {{while it was still}} dark, grabbed her revolver and ran next door to find Fannie bruised and beaten, with scuff marks across the white floor. Taylor was screaming that someone needed to get her baby. She said a black man was in her house; he had come through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> assaulted her. The neighbor found the baby, but no one else. Taylor's initial report stated her assailant beat her about the face but did not rape her. Rumors circulated—widely believed by whites in Sumner—that she was both raped and robbed. [...] The charge of rape of a white woman by a black was inflammatory in the South: the day before, the Klan had held a parade and rally of over 100 hooded Klansmen [...] away in [...] Gainesville under a burning cross and a banner reading, [...] "First and Always Protect Womanhood".|$|E
500|$|Germans {{entered the}} home that Creger and Slape were using as an {{observation}} post. Slape {{climbed into the}} attic, while Creger only had time to hide behind a door. He pulled the pin on a grenade as the door knob jammed into his ribs. Bullets from the I&R platoon struck the building, and the Germans suddenly left. Creger and Slape exited by <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> ducked into a nearby cowshed. They crossed a field and then {{found themselves in a}} minefield. Picking their way forward, they circled through the woods until they encountered a handful of Germans. Opening fire, they killed them. Creger and Slape spotted Bouck and Milosevich across the road and sprinted towards them, drawing German fire. They made it back to their ridge-top position and Bouck called Regimental Headquarters. He requested artillery support, but when he reported the German column advancing on his position, the {{voice on the other end}} of the radio told him [...] "he must be seeing things". Bouck told them he had 20-20 vision and demanded artillery fire on the road in front of his unit.|$|E

2500|$|The final B-body Caprice was {{not well}} {{received}} by critics and did not hold on to high sales numbers. The car's styling was criticized with car aficionados calling it a [...] "beached whale" [...] and [...] "an upside-down bathtub". For 1993 there were some revisions, the most obvious being {{the removal of the}} skirted rear wheel wells in favor of more conventional, open wheel wells. This applied only to the sedan model; station wagons retained the skirted wheel wells. A final appearance tweak appeared on the 1995 Caprice sedan {{in the form of a}} restyled side window between <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> C pillar (windows on Caprices of the generation through 1994 were triangular, but the 1995 window had 4 sides and lacked the sharp corner pointed toward the rear), and the wagon was given the same mirrors as the sedan. In 1996 the Impala SS was exported to Middle Eastern markets badged as the Caprice SS, with the car being identical to its American counterpart except for the side fonts on the rear quarter panel & the badge on the dashboard saying Caprice SS.|$|E
2500|$|The episode [...] "Company Man" [...] {{begins with}} the hostage-taking of the Bennet family by Sprague and Parkman, who are in search of answers. Noah Bennet has revelations about his company during this situation, showing that he {{initially}} came to work for [...] "The Company" [...] {{under the supervision of}} a man named Thompson, and partnered with Claude. He is eventually ordered to kill Claude, because Claude apparently was hiding [...] "one of them" [...] from The Company. During the confrontation with Sprague, Thompson comes through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> shoots Ted, who goes into an uncontrolled radioactive state. Noah Bennet and Matt escape the house, while Claire tranquilizes Sprague. After this, Matt and Ted are taken to the paper factory. Thompson asks Bennet when Claire should be showing up at the factory. It is at that moment that Bennet realizes he's too attached to Claire. The graphic novel [...] "Family Man" [...] reveals that, at this point, Noah Bennet decides that he must do what he can to save Claire and [...] "bring down the people [...] work for." [...] Having noticed that he is being followed by someone from The Company, Noah Bennet drives to a cybercafé and sends a message to Hana asking for help, which she agrees to do. The episode ends with Noah Bennet taking Claire to the same bridge on which he shot Claude so many years ago. The Haitian shows up, and Bennet instructs the Haitian to shoot him in the stomach, then [...] "Go deep" [...] and wipe anything out of his memory that could lead [...] "them" [...] to Claire. The Haitian follows the order, then takes Claire away to protect her, as instructed.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the moments}} after Regina {{encouraged}} Zelena {{to pursue a}} relationship with Hades, the move has the outsiders, especially Hook, unhappy with this new development. But before tensions start to reach a boiling point, Hades appears and informs them that Zelena had been kidnapped by Gold and Peter Pan. A note Hades produces makes clear Gold and Pan are using Zelena as leverage in a trade deal for the contract on Gold's unborn child. Hades asks Emma for help by arranging a deal in which she will help him get Zelena back in exchange for Hades erasing the outsiders' names from their gravestones so they can leave the Underworld. At the diner, Hades closes up the place so he can meet with Gold and Pan. Zelena, who has been cuffed and prevented from using magic, is with them. Hades agrees to Gold's demands and rips up the contract, only to have Pan add that he will take Zelena's heart {{as part of his}} plan to return to the living. As Pan attempts to rip out Zelena's heart, Emma breaks in through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> blasts him with Light Magic, stopping Pan. Gold and Pan leave separately during the confrontation, and without complete satisfaction. As Hades and Zelena are reunited, Hades frees Zelena by removing the cuff, and the two share a kiss. Suddenly Hades' heart begins to beat once again, resulting in a new level of fulfillment in Hades' vision for a [...] "normal" [...] life and leaving the Underworld with Zelena. As part of the arranged deal with Emma along with Hades' new freedom, a portal to Storybrooke can open which will close at sunset. As promised, Hades wipes the outsiders' names off the gravestones. Before the portal opens, Emma attempts to give half her heart to Hook so he can live again and travel through the portal safely, but the process doesn't work. Hades explains that Hook's soul {{might not be able to}} return to a decaying body, because he has been in the Underworld too long. Emma's insistence on a way to bring Hook back leads to Hades telling of a rumor of the only time when someone was able to bring the dead back to life from the Underworld: the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. According to what worked in that tale, Hook must acquire Ambrosia, the food of the gods, to restore his body and be reunited safely with his body; but in order to get to the Ambrosia, Emma has to go deep into the Underworld, and face a test to determine whether her love for Hook is true, by testing her heart. Before Emma and Hook go on their quest, Hades removes Emma's heart so that she can bring it with her for the test that she and Hook will face. The others promise her that they will wait for their return, but must leave by sunset in case Emma and Hook do not succeed.|$|E
