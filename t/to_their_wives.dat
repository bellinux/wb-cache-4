5|$|By early 1844, a rift {{developed}} between Smith {{and a half}} dozen of his closest associates. Most notably, William Law, Smith's trusted counselor, and Robert Foster, a general of the Nauvoo Legion, disagreed with Smith about how to manage Nauvoo's economy. Both also said that Smith had proposed marriage <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>wives.</b> Believing the dissidents were plotting against his life, Smith excommunicated them on April 18, 1844. These dissidents formed a competing church and the following month, at Carthage, the county seat, they procured indictments against Smith for perjury and polygamy.|$|E
5|$|During Team Canada's stay in Moscow, the team's {{treatment}} {{was the source}} of numerous complaints by the players. When leaving Sweden, the team was informed that the players would stay at one hotel, their wives at another. The players threatened not to go, and the arrangements were changed to keep the players and wives together at the Intourist Hotel. The players' wives were fed sub-standard food and the players would smuggle some of their food <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>wives.</b> The team had contracted to have Canadian beer and steaks delivered to them in Moscow. The beer was lost at the airport, while the steaks were cut in half. At a practice after game six, the Soviets tried to cut short the Canadians' practice.|$|E
5|$|Historian Ban Zhao (45116 CE) {{wrote in}} her Lessons for Women that, like the {{opposite}} and complementary forces of yin and yang, men's great virtues were strength and rigidity, while a woman's great virtues were respect and compliance. Throughout her life, a Han woman was to bend {{to the will of}} first her father, then her husband, and then her adult son (三從四德). However, there are many recorded deviations from this rule, as some Han women are written to have engaged in heated arguments with their husbands over concubines (sometimes beating concubines out of jealousy and to punish the husband), wrote essays and letters for husbands serving as government officials, and sometimes husbands turned <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>wives</b> for advice on political affairs of the court. When a father died, the eldest son was theoretically the senior member of the family, yet as hinted in various works of Han literature, they still had to obey the will of their mother and she could even force them to kowtow to her when apologizing for an offense. Deviations from common customs regarding gender were especially pronounced in the imperial family. The empress was able to give orders to her male relatives (even her father) and if they disobeyed her, she could publicly reprimand and humiliate them.|$|E

5000|$|In {{criminal}} cases, {{however, the}} common law long held that wives were not in general competent to give evidence against their husbands (i.e. for the prosecution).

5|$|Prior to his suicide, Joseph Goebbels finally {{released}} Misch {{from further}} service; {{he was free}} to leave. Misch and mechanic Johannes Hentschel were two of the last people remaining in the bunker. They exchanged letters <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>wives</b> in case anything happened to either of them. Misch then went upstairs through the cellars of the Reich Chancellery to where Schädle had his office to report one last time. According to Hentschel, by that time Schädle's shrapnel leg wound had turned gangrenous. Misch told Schädle that Goebbels had released him. Schädle told Misch of the route he should take to try to get through the Soviet encirclement of the area. After helping Misch, Schädle shot himself. Misch fled the bunker in the early morning of 2 May, only hours before the Red Army seized it. He met up with some other soldiers and they travelled north through the U-Bahn tunnels. Shortly thereafter, they were taken prisoner by Red Army soldiers. Misch was brought to Lubyanka Prison in Moscow, where he was tortured by Soviet NKVD officers in an attempt to extract information regarding Hitler's last days. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was extremely interested in learning of Hitler's fate and theories about possible escape. Misch spent eight years in Soviet forced labour camps.|$|E

500|$|The {{penetration}} of the bride's infibulation takes anywhere from 3 or 4 days to several months. Some men are unable <b>to</b> penetrate <b>their</b> <b>wives</b> at all (in my study over 15%), and the task is often accomplished by a midwife under conditions of great secrecy, since this reflects negatively on the man's potency. Some who are unable <b>to</b> penetrate <b>their</b> <b>wives</b> manage <b>to</b> get them pregnant {{in spite of the}} infibulation, and the woman's vaginal passage is then cut open to allow birth to take place.... Those men who do manage <b>to</b> penetrate <b>their</b> <b>wives</b> do so often, or perhaps always, {{with the help of the}} [...] "little knife". This creates a tear which they gradually rip more and more until the opening is sufficient to admit the penis.|$|R

25|$|While it {{is widely}} assumed that the problem lies {{primarily}} in men refusing to grant a get <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>wives</b> {{and that it is}} a widespread issue, in Israel, figures released from the chief rabbinate show that women equally refuse to accept a get and that the numbers are a couple of hundred on each side.

25|$|Unlike {{other groups}} which formed yeshivas in pre-war Poland, Belz {{maintained}} a unique yoshvim program, developed by Rabbi Yissachar Dov, which produced many outstanding Torah scholars. The yoshvim were married and unmarried men {{who remained in}} the synagogue all day to study the Talmud, pray, and derive inspiration from their Rebbe. They were supported by local businessmen, and their food and other necessities were brought to them so they wouldn't {{have to leave the}} synagogue for even a short time. Some yoshvim even slept in the synagogue on benches. They typically remained in this program until the Rebbe would tell them to return home <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>wives</b> and families.|$|E
25|$|A second graph-theoretic {{description}} {{of the problem is}} also possible. Once the women have been seated, the possible seating arrangements for the remaining men can be described as perfect matchings in a graph formed by removing a single Hamiltonian cycle from a complete bipartite graph; the graph has edges connecting open seats to men, and the removal of the cycle corresponds to forbidding the men to sit in either of the open seats adjacent <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>wives.</b> The problem of counting matchings in a bipartite graph, and therefore a fortiori the problem of computing ménage numbers, can be solved using the permanents of certain 0-1 matrices. In the case of the ménage problem, the matrices arising from this view of the problem are circulant matrices.|$|E

25|$|Most {{accounts}} of the scandal begin with the visit of {{the king and queen}} of England to the queen's father in France during 1313. During the visit, Louis and Charles had had a satirical puppet show put on for their guests, and after this Isabella had given new embroidered purses both to her brothers and <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>wives.</b> Later in the year, Isabella and Edward held a large dinner in London to celebrate their return and Isabella apparently noticed that the purses she had given to her sisters-in-law were now being carried by two Norman knights, Gautier and Philippe d'Aunay. Isabella concluded that the pair must have been carrying on an illicit affair, and appears to have informed her father of this during her next visit to France in 1314.|$|E
25|$|In the Calcutta {{scene of}} {{the mid to late}} nineteenth century, Ramakrishna was opinionated on the subject of Chakri. Chakri can be {{described}} as a type of low-paying servitude done by educated men—typically government or commerce-related clerical positions. On a basic level, Ramakrishna saw this system as a corrupt form of European social organisation that forced educated men to be servants not only to their bosses at the office but also <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>wives</b> at home. What Ramakrishna saw as the primary detriment of Chakri, however, was that it forced workers into a rigid, impersonal clock-based time structure. He saw the imposition of strict adherence to each second on the watch as a roadblock to spirituality. Despite this, however, Ramakrishna demonstrated that Bhakti could be practised as an inner retreat to experience solace in the face of Western-style discipline and often discrimination in the workplace.|$|E
