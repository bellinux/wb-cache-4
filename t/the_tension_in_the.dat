5|$|In 1962, Ray {{directed}} Kanchenjungha. Based on {{his first}} original screenplay, {{it was his first}} film in colour. The film tells of an upper-class family spending an afternoon in Darjeeling, a picturesque hill town in West Bengal. They try to arrange the engagement of their youngest daughter to a highly paid engineer educated in London. He had first conceived shooting the film in a large mansion, but later decided to film it in the famous hill town. He used the many shades of light and mist to reflect <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> drama. Ray noted that while his script allowed shooting to be possible under any lighting conditions, a commercial film contingent present {{at the same time in}} Darjeeling failed to shoot a single scene, as they only wanted to do so in sunshine.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Clairmont {{became a}} lover of the Romantic poet Lord Byron, and Mary Godwin and Shelley had a second child on 24 January 1816, who was named William after Godwin. In February, Imlay went to visit the Shelleys, who had settled in Bishopsgate. Godwin's debts {{continued}} to mount, and while he demanded money from Shelley, Godwin still refused to see either him or his daughter. At this time, Charles Clairmont (Imlay's step-brother), frustrated with <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Godwin household, left for France and refused to help the family any further. At around the same time, Claire Clairmont, Mary Godwin, and Shelley left for the Continent, seeking Byron. Godwin was aghast. He relied on Shelley's money, and the stain on his family's reputation only increased when the public learned that the group had left to join the rakish Byron.|$|E

25|$|Newton {{examined}} {{this problem}} himself using rotating spheres, {{as shown in}} Figure 2 and Figure 3. He pointed out that if the spheres are not rotating, <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tying string is measured as zero in every frame of reference. If the spheres only appear to rotate (that is, we are watching stationary spheres from a rotating frame), the zero tension in the string is accounted for by observing that the centripetal force is supplied by the centrifugal and Coriolis forces in combination, so no tension is needed. If the spheres really are rotating, the tension observed is exactly the centripetal force required by the circular motion. Thus, measurement of <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> string identifies the inertial frame: {{it is the one}} where <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> string provides exactly the centripetal force demanded by the motion as it is observed in that frame, and not a different value. That is, the inertial frame is the one where the fictitious forces vanish.|$|E

25|$|A {{classic example}} of fictitious force in {{circular}} motion is the experiment of rotating spheres tied by a cord and spinning around their center of mass. In this case, as with the linearly accelerating car example, the identification of a rotating, non-inertial frame of reference can be based upon the vanishing of fictitious forces. In an inertial frame, fictitious forces are not necessary to explain <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> string joining the spheres. In a rotating frame, Coriolis and centrifugal forces must be introduced to predict the observed tension.|$|E
25|$|Some steel arch bridges (such as the Navajo Bridge) {{are built}} using pure {{cantilever}} spans from each side, with neither falsework below nor temporary supporting towers and cables above. These are then joined with a pin, usually after forcing the union point apart, and when jacks are removed and the bridge decking is added the bridge becomes a truss arch bridge. Such unsupported construction is only possible where appropriate rock {{is available to}} support <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper chord of the span during construction, usually limiting this method to the spanning of narrow canyons.|$|E
25|$|Topoisomerase inhibitors are {{drugs that}} affect the {{activity}} of two enzymes: topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II. When the DNA double-strand helix is unwound, during DNA replication or transcription, for example, the adjacent unopened DNA winds tighter (supercoils), like opening {{the middle of a}} twisted rope. The stress caused by this effect is in part aided by the topoisomerase enzymes. They produce single- or double-strand breaks into DNA, reducing <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DNA strand. This allows the normal unwinding of DNA to occur during replication or transcription. Inhibition of topoisomerase I or II interferes with both of these processes.|$|E

25|$|By {{determining}} an object's {{acceleration and}} integrating over time, {{the velocity of}} the object can be calculated. Integrating again, position can be determined. The simplest accelerometer is a weight that is free to move horizontally, which {{is attached to a}} spring and a device to measure <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring. This can be improved by introducing a counteracting force to push the weight back and to measure the force needed to prevent the weight from moving. A more complicated design consists of a gyroscope with a weight on one of the axes. The device will react to the force generated by the weight when it is accelerated, by integrating that force to produce a velocity.|$|E
25|$|In {{suspension}} bridges, large main cables (normally two) hang {{between the}} towers and are anchored {{at each end}} to the ground. This {{can be difficult to}} implement when ground conditions are poor. The main cables, which are free to move on bearings in the towers, bear the load of the bridge deck. Before the deck is installed, the cables are under tension from their own weight. Along the main cables smaller cables or rods connect to the bridge deck, which is lifted in sections. As this is done, <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cables increases, as it does with the live load of traffic crossing the bridge. The tension on the main cables is transferred to the ground at the anchorages and by downwards tug on the towers.|$|E
25|$|For the {{treatment}} of trauma patients every minute counts. Patients with severe bleedings after car accidents, explosions, gunshot wounds or aortic dissections, etc. need immediate care due to the life-threatening blood loss. In a hybrid operating room both open and endovascular treatment of the patient can be performed. For example, <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain due to a severe haemorrhage can be relieved and the aneurysm can be coiled. The concept of placing the emergency patient on an operating table as soon as he/she enters the hospital, if stable perform a trauma scan in the CT or if instable immediate procedure in the hybrid operating room without having to reposition the patient can save valuable time and reduce risk of further injury.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, timpani were hand-tuned; that is, {{there was a}} {{sequence}} of screws with T-shaped handles, called taps, which altered <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head when turned by players. Thus, tuning was a relatively slow operation, and composers had to allow {{a reasonable amount of}} time for players to change notes if they were called to tune {{in the middle of a}} work. The first 'machine' timpani, with a single tuning handle, was developed in 1812. The first pedal timpani originated in Dresden in the 1870s and are called Dresden timpani for this reason. However, since vellum was used for the heads of the drums, automated solutions were difficult to implement since the tension would vary unpredictably across the drum. This could be compensated for by hand-tuning, but not easily by a pedal drum. Mechanisms continued to improve in the early 20th century.|$|E

25|$|The central concept {{around which}} this play is built is {{the dilemma of}} what to do with Harry and Edna. Their {{situation}} is the focal point for all the characters, including Harry and Edna themselves. Albee uses this dilemma to cause emotions to rise. As his characters try to figure out what to do about the Harry and Edna, they have a series of discussions or debates that slowly rise in emotional temperature. Each character has his or her definition of what the dilemma is, as well as a means for resolving it. <b>The</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> play rises with the rise of emotions as the characters move toward a climax or a moment of truth. This moment is played out most specifically by Tobias and Harry in the conversation that defines their friendship: one that is built on rights and responsibilities rather than love and affection. In the end, Harry and Edna decide to go back home, thus solving, or at least releasing some of the tension of the dilemma.|$|E

25|$|Colditz: The Full Story (1984) : While {{the first}} two books {{can be read as}} {{adventure}} narratives, and have a distinctly ‘Battler Briton’ ethos of ‘sticking one up to the goons’ this book takes a more analytic approach, and covers a number of previously suppressed details. For example, Reid describes some of the ways prisoners obtained contraband material, and how British prisoners communicated clandestinely with <b>the</b> authorities <b>in</b> London. He also gives a full account of how prisoners discovered the 'Singen Escape Route'. He also deals with some of <b>the</b> <b>tensions</b> and tragedies of wartime Europe, for example <b>the</b> <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> French contingents between Gaullists and supporters of Pétain. <b>The</b> <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Polish contingent are still skated over however. The book was written while Poland was still a Communist state (indeed while the 1981 state of emergency was still operating). Having been schooled at Clongowes, Reid's comments on individuals seem to show sympathy for the 'Conservative Catholic Patriot' officers at Colditz, without giving enough background to allow readers to assess whether there were any continuing controversies around some of these positions.|$|R
25|$|In Newton's {{time the}} fixed stars were invoked as a {{reference}} frame, supposedly at rest relative to absolute space. In reference frames that were either at rest {{with respect to the}} fixed stars or in uniform translation relative to these stars, Newton's laws of motion were supposed to hold. In contrast, in frames accelerating with respect to the fixed stars, an important case being frames rotating relative to the fixed stars, the laws of motion did not hold in their simplest form, but had to be supplemented by the addition of fictitious forces, for example, the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force. Two interesting experiments were devised by Newton to demonstrate how these forces could be discovered, thereby revealing to an observer that they were not in an inertial frame: the example of <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cord linking two spheres rotating about their center of gravity, and the example of the curvature of the surface of water in a rotating bucket. In both cases, application of Newton's second law would not work for the rotating observer without invoking centrifugal and Coriolis forces to account for their observations (tension {{in the case of the}} spheres; parabolic water surface in the case of the rotating bucket).|$|E

For this launch method, the glider's main wheel rests in a small concrete trough. The hook normally used for winch-launching is instead attached to the middle of the bungee. Each end is then pulled by three or four people. One group runs slightly to the left, the other to the right. Once <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bungee is high enough, the glider is released and the glider's wheel pops out of the trough.
