5|$|Later on {{the evening}} of 7 August, she asked Bamber whether he had done it. He said no, but that a friend of his had, whom he named; the man was a plumber the family had used in the past. Bamber {{allegedly}} said he had told <b>this</b> <b>friend</b> how he could enter and leave the farmhouse undetected, and that one of his instructions had been for the friend to telephone him from the farm on one of the phones in the house that had a memory redial facility, so that if the police checked it, it would give him an alibi. Everything had gone as planned, he said, except that Nevill had put up a fight, and the friend had become angry and shot him seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Bamber said. The friend then placed the Bible on her chest so she appeared to have killed herself in a religious frenzy. The children were shot in their sleep, he said. Mugford said Bamber claimed to have paid the friend £2,000.|$|E

In November 2008, lead singer Chester Bennington said the new record was a concept album; he said it [...] "sound a little daunting to me, so, I think my confidence level will drop, but when it was presented to us by <b>this</b> <b>friend</b> of ours, we liked the idea.

The expatriate West End actor was given the role of Alan on the recommendation of his friend, Holliday: [...] "They were having great difficulty casting the part of Alan as they wanted a certain sound for him, being the youngest brother.

500|$|Mrs. Mason's {{amalgam of}} tales and {{teaching}} excursions dominates the text; although the text emphasizes the girls' moral progress, the reader learns {{very little about}} the girls themselves. The work consists largely of personal histories of people known to Mrs. Mason and of moral tales for the edification of Mary and Caroline and the reader. For example, [...] "The History of Charles Townley" [...] illustrates the fatal consequences of procrastination. Mrs. Mason takes the girls to Charles Townley's ruined mansion to tell them the cautionary tale of a [...] "boy of uncommon abilities, and strong feelings"; unfortunately, [...] "he ever permitted those feelings to direct his conduct, without submitting to the direction of reason; I mean, the present emotion governed him ... He always indeed intended to act right in every particular to-morrow; but to-day he followed the prevailing whim" [...] (emphasis Wollstonecraft's). Charles wants to help those in need, but he is easily distracted by novels and plays. He eventually loses all of his money but his one remaining friend helps him regain his fortune in India. Yet even when <b>this</b> <b>friend</b> needs assistance, Charles cannot act quickly enough and, tragically, his friend is imprisoned and dies and his friend's daughter is forced to marry a rake. When Charles returns to England, he is overcome with guilt. He rescues the daughter from her unhappy marriage, but both she and he have gone slightly insane {{by the end of the}} story, she from her marriage and he from guilt.|$|E

This correspondence introduced Freud to the concept of the [...] "oceanic feeling" [...] that Rolland had developed through his study of Eastern mysticism. Freud opened his next book Civilization and its Discontents (1929) with a debate on the nature of this feeling, which he mentioned had been noted to him by an anonymous [...] "friend". <b>This</b> <b>friend</b> was Rolland.

George tells Nick about a time that he went to a gin-mill with some {{boarding}} school classmates, one of whom had accidentally killed his mother by shooting her. <b>This</b> <b>friend</b> was laughed at for ordering [...] "bergin". The following summer, the friend accidentally killed his father while driving, was committed to an asylum, and never spoke again. George and Nick discuss the possibility of having children and eventually argue and insult each other. After they rejoin the women in the house, Martha and Nick dance suggestively. Martha also reveals the truth about George's creative writing escapades: he had tried to publish a novel about a boy who accidentally killed both of his parents (with the implication that the deaths were actually murder), but Martha's father would not let it be published. George responds by attacking Martha, but Nick separates them.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1992, Fred {{asked his}} 13-year-old {{daughter}} {{to bring some}} bottles to a room {{on the first floor}} of their home. Rose was not present in the home at the time. Shortly thereafter, the girl's siblings heard her scream, [...] "No, don't!" [...] Later, Fred returned downstairs. The girl was found by her siblings writhing in pain, sobbing that her father had raped and sodomised her, at one stage partially strangling her. When Rose returned home, the girl confided in her mother that she had been raped by Fred, although Rose simply replied, [...] "Oh well. You were asking for it." [...] Over the following weeks, the girl was raped on three further occasions, with Rose personally witnessing one of these rapes before following her distressed and bleeding daughter into the bathroom and asking the child, [...] "Well, what did you expect?" [...] Fred also filmed one of these rapes. Several weeks later, the girl garnered the courage to confide in a close friend what her father had done; <b>this</b> <b>friend</b> would divulge what had happened to her own mother on 4 August. In response, the friend's mother anonymously informed the police.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Late Night host David Letterman was {{preparing}} to leave, prompting executive producer Lorne Michaels {{to search for a}} new host. Michaels approached O'Brien to produce; then-agent Gavin Polone stressed that O'Brien wanted to perform, rather than produce. He arranged with Michaels that O'Brien would do a test audition on the stage of The Tonight Show. Jason Alexander and Mimi Rogers were the guests, and the audience was composed of Simpsons writers. Wolodarksky recalled the experience: [...] "Seeing <b>this</b> <b>friend</b> of yours, this guy that you worked with, walk out from behind that curtain and deliver a monologue was like something you could only dream up that you couldn’t ever imagine actually happening." [...] The performance was beamed by satellite to New York, where Lorne Michaels and NBC executives watched. O'Brien was picked as the new host of Late Night on April 26, 1993. As the writers headed to the voice record for [...] "Homer Goes to College", O'Brien {{received a phone call from}} Polone informing him of the decision. [...] "He was passed out facedown into this horrible shag carpet. He was just quiet and comatose down there on that carpet," [...] recalled postproduction supervisor Michael Mendel.

2500|$|A week later, on February 23, the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee {{convened a}} meeting to invite Fluke to speak. Fluke offered {{testimony}} in support of President Obama's ruling that religiously affiliated institutions such as universities and hospitals should provide insurance plans that cover all costs for medicinal contraceptives. During her testimony, Fluke stated, [...] "We did not expect that women would be told in the national media {{that we should have}} gone to school elsewhere" [...] to receive contraception coverage. [...] "We refuse to pick between a quality education and our health," [...] she said. Fluke further stated that 40% of Georgetown Law School's female population suffered financial hardship as a result of birth control not being covered by the student health insurance plan, and that the lack of contraception coverage in the university insurance plans would induce many low-income students to go without contraceptives. She said that the women of Georgetown, other religious schools, and employees of religious institutions such as hospitals have endured [...] "financial, emotional and medical burdens because of this lack of contraceptive coverage". She mentioned friends affected by such policies, citing a friend with polycystic ovary syndrome. Fluke stated <b>this</b> <b>friend</b> needed contraceptive hormones costing over $100 per month to treat the disease, and that while PcOS was [...] "covered by Georgetown insurance", the insurance company repeatedly denied contraceptives because they suspected the purpose of the medication was for contraceptive uses.|$|E
