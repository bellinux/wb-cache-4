5|$|Habitat loss. Gopher <b>tortoises</b> (Georgia, Florida's {{official}} tortoise) {{have been}} {{impacted by the}} loss of 97% of the Southeast's longleaf pine forest.|$|E
5|$|Painted turtles defend {{themselves}} by kicking, scratching, biting, or urinating. In contrast to land <b>tortoises,</b> painted turtles can right themselves {{if they are}} flipped upside down.|$|E
5|$|The large {{populations of}} <b>tortoises</b> and marine turtles on Rodrigues {{resulted}} in the export of thousands of animals, and cats were introduced to control the rats, but the cats attacked the native birds and <b>tortoises</b> as well. The Rodrigues starling was already extinct on the mainland by this time. Rats are adept at crossing water, and inhabit almost all islets off Rodrigues today. At least five species of Aplonis starlings have become extinct in islands of the Pacific Ocean, and rats also contributed to their demise.|$|E

5000|$|Hermann's <b>tortoise</b> (Testudo hermanni) {{is one of}} five <b>tortoise</b> species {{traditionally}} placed in the genus Testudo, the others being the marginated <b>tortoise</b> (T. marginata), Greek <b>tortoise</b> (T. graeca, or spur-thighed <b>tortoise),</b> Russian <b>tortoise</b> (T. horsfieldii [...] ), and Kleinmann's <b>tortoise</b> (T. kleinmanni, or Egyptian <b>tortoise).</b> Two subspecies are known: the western Hermann's <b>tortoise</b> (T. h. hermanni [...] ) and the eastern Hermann's <b>tortoise</b> (T. h. boettgeri [...] ). Sometimes mentioned as a subspecies, T. h. peleponnesica is not yet confirmed to be genetically different from T. h. boettgeri.|$|R
25|$|The {{angonoka}} <b>tortoise</b> (Astrochelys yniphora) is {{a critically}} endangered species of <b>tortoise</b> endemic to Madagascar. It {{is also known}} as the angonoka, ploughshare <b>tortoise,</b> Madagascar <b>tortoise,</b> or Madagascar angulated <b>tortoise.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the spring}} in 1795, Surcouf took {{command of the}} 180-ton, {{privateer}} schooner Modeste, renamed Émilie, with a 32-man crew and four 6-pounder guns, armed by Malroux and Levaillant. Governor Malartic refused to provide a lettre de marque and ordered Émilie {{to go to the}} Seychelles to purchase <b>tortoises</b> as food for Isle de France.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the broad-billed parrot may have depended on dodos and Cylindraspis <b>tortoises</b> to eat palm fruits and excrete their seeds, which became food for the parrots. Anodorhynchus macaws depended on now-extinct South American megafauna in the same way, but now rely on domesticated cattle for this service.|$|E
5|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} {{is known}} from several groups of animals {{both in the}} sea and on land (see table). Cleaners include fish, shrimps and birds; clients include a much wider range of fish, marine reptiles including turtles and iguanas, octopus, whales, and terrestrial mammals. Cleaning symbioses with reptile clients include fish cleaning the teeth of American crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus), geckos eating mosquitoes on Aldabra giant <b>tortoises</b> (Geochelone gigantea) and scarlet crabs (Grapsus grapsus), and three species of Galapagos finches removing ticks from marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus).|$|E
5000|$|The spur-thighed <b>tortoise</b> (or Greek <b>tortoise)</b> (Testudo graeca) {{is one of}} five {{species of}} Mediterranean <b>tortoise</b> (genus Testudo, family Testudinidae). The other four species are the Hermann's <b>tortoise</b> (Testudo hermanni), Russian <b>tortoise</b> (Testudo horsfieldii), Egyptian <b>tortoise</b> (Testudo kleinmanni), and marginated <b>tortoise</b> (Testudo marginata). The spur-thighed <b>tortoise</b> is a very long lived animal, {{achieving}} a lifespan of upwards of 125 years, with some unverified reports of up to 200 years.|$|R

5|$|Four genera are {{represented}} with different {{species in the}} list. Terrapene (box turtles) has Terrapene ornata (Kansas) along with Terrapene carolina (Missouri, North Carolina, and Tennessee). Under Gopherus (gopher <b>tortoises),</b> there are Gopherus polyphemus (Georgia's state reptile and Florida's state tortoise) and Gopherus agassizii (California and Nevada). Under Crotalus (one of two rattlesnake genera), Arizona named Crotalus willardi willardi, while West Virginia chose Crotalus horridus. With Phrynosoma (horned lizards), Wyoming specified the entire genus, but Texas specified Phrynosoma cornutum.|$|E
5|$|Hypogeomys australis {{is one of}} {{only three}} extinct rodents known from Madagascar (the others are Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis and Nesomys narindaensis from northwestern Madagascar). In general, few small animals became extinct on Madagascar, except for these rodents, two species of Plesiorycteropus, and the shrew tenrec Microgale macpheei; in contrast, large animals such as subfossil lemurs, the {{carnivore}} Cryptoprocta spelea, Malagasy hippopotamuses, Dipsochelys <b>tortoises,</b> and Aepyornis and Mullerornis birds all became extinct around the time that humans arrived.|$|E
5|$|Next, Cuvier {{identifies}} the taxonomic {{divisions of the}} group, in this case four orders of reptiles, the chelonians (<b>tortoises</b> and turtles), saurians (lizards), ophidians (snakes) and batracians (amphibians, now considered a separate class of vertebrates), describing each group in a single sentence. Thus the batracians {{are said to have}} a heart with a single atrium, a naked body (with no scales), and to pass with age from being fish-like to being like a quadruped or biped.|$|E

5|$|The rapid {{disappearance}} of the Rodrigues rail may {{have been caused by}} introduced cats, but {{it is also possible that}} deforestation by tortoise hunters may have contributed significantly; from 1735, these hunters burned off forests so they could collect giant Cylindraspis <b>tortoises</b> for their meat and oil. The French astronomer Alexandre Guy Pingré, who visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, wrote in 1763 that the bird was extinct by the time of his visit.|$|E
5|$|The stouter {{build and}} more bent {{shape of the}} {{mandible}} shows that the Rodrigues starling used greater force than the hoopoe starling when searching and perhaps digging for food. It probably also {{had the ability to}} remove objects and forcefully open entrances when searching for food; it did this by inserting its wedge-shaped bill and opening its mandibles, as other starlings and crows do. This ability supports Tafforet's claim that the bird fed on eggs and dead <b>tortoises.</b> It could have torn dead, presumably juvenile, turtles and <b>tortoises</b> out of their shells. Tafforet did not see any Rodrigues starlings on the mainland, but he stated that they could easily be reared by feeding them meat, which indicates that he brought young birds from a breeding population on Île Gombrani. Tafforet was marooned on Rodrigues during the summer and was apparently able to procure juvenile individuals; some other Rodrigues birds are known to breed at this time, so {{it is likely that the}} starling did the same.|$|E
5|$|Unusual for a {{television}} series, the sound team receives {{a rough cut}} of a full season and approaches it as a ten-hour feature film. Although seasons one and two had different sound teams, one team has {{been in charge of}} sound since then. For the show's blood-and-gore sounds, the team often uses a chamois. For dragon screams, mating <b>tortoises</b> and dolphin, seal, lion and bird sounds have been used.|$|E

5|$|As, {{according}} to Bulgarian mythology {{and some other}} traditions, <b>tortoises</b> were the only beings who knew {{the appearance of the}} herb and the location where it grows, such people would try to obtain the raskovnik by deceiving a tortoise. They would find a tortoise nesting site and hem it in with a fence while the tortoise is away. When it returns, the tortoise would be unable to access its eggs, so it would return with a raskovnik in order to breach the fence. Thus, the tortoise would reveal the herb and people would acquire it from the tortoise, which does not need it anymore.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of evolution, the skull has been {{modified}} in most diapsids from the original version evident in the fossil record. However, all the original features are preserved in that of the tuatara; it has two openings – a temporal fenestra {{on each side of}} the skull, with complete arches. In addition, the upper jaw is firmly attached to the skull. This makes for a very rigid, inflexible construction. Testudines (turtles and <b>tortoises)</b> have anapsid skulls – they lack any temporal fenestrae, are sometimes considered to be the most primitive among amniotes, though evidence strongly indicates they may have lost the temporal openings rather than never having had them.|$|E
5|$|The fruits {{produced}} by cacti after the flowers have been fertilized vary considerably; many are fleshy, although some are dry. All contain {{a large number}} of seeds. Fleshy, colorful and sweet-tasting fruits are associated with seed dispersal by birds. The seeds pass through their digestive systems and are deposited in their droppings. Fruit that falls to the ground may be eaten by other animals; giant <b>tortoises</b> are reported to distribute Opuntia seeds in the Galápagos Islands. Ants appear to disperse the seeds of a few genera, such as Blossfeldia. Drier spiny fruits may cling to the fur of mammals or be moved around by the wind.|$|E
50|$|Forsten's <b>tortoise</b> (Indotestudo forstenii) is one {{of three}} <b>tortoise</b> species placed in the genus Indotestudo, the others being the {{elongated}} <b>tortoise</b> (I. elongata), and travancore <b>tortoise</b> (I.travancorica).|$|R

50|$|The yellow-footed <b>tortoise</b> is {{also called}} the yellow-foot or yellow-legged <b>tortoise,</b> the Brazilian giant <b>tortoise,</b> or South American forest <b>tortoise,</b> {{as well as local}} names such as morrocoy, woyamou or wayamo, or some {{variation}} of jabuta. Many of the local names are shared with the similar red-footed <b>tortoise.</b>|$|R
5|$|The park's 36 reptile species include desert <b>tortoises,</b> diamondback rattlesnakes (one of {{the more}} {{commonly}} seen snakes), coral snakes, Gila monsters, short-horned lizards, spiny lizards, and zebra-tailed lizards. Despite the aridity, three amphibian species inhabit the park: the canyon tree frog, the lowland leopard frog, and Couch's spadefoot, which lives in underground burrows, emerging to breed during summer rains. Forest fires, which create erosion-prone burned areas, have destroyed many of the leopard frog's breeding pools, which fill with sediment. The Arizona Game and Fish Department lists the lowland leopard frog as a species of special concern.|$|E
5|$|Candi Sukuh {{temple of}} Ngancar, East Java, {{was built in}} the 10th century and is {{dedicated}} to Shiva and is evidence of Tantric ritual in Hinduism and the fertility cult practiced at the time and preoccupation with the lingga. The temple has numerous reliefs graphically depicting sexuality and fertility including several stone depictions of a copulating penis and vagina. It consists of a pyramid with reliefs and statues at the front. Among them is a male statue clutching his penis, with three <b>tortoises</b> with flattened shells. The temple once had a striking 1.82 metre (5'11.5ft) representation of lingga with four testicles; this is now housed in the National Museum of Indonesia. Phallic references were also made in Khmer architecture in Cambodia, and several Khmer temples depict the phallus in reliefs.|$|E
5|$|In 1725, the French sailor Julien Tafforet was marooned on the Mascarene {{island of}} Rodrigues for nine months, and his report {{of his time}} there was later {{published}} as Relation d'île Rodrigue. In the report, he described encounters with various indigenous species, including a white and black bird which fed on eggs and dead <b>tortoises.</b> He stated that it was confined to the offshore islet of Île Gombrani, which was then called au Mât. François Leguat, a Frenchman who was also marooned on Rodrigues from 1691 to 1693 and had written about several species there (his account was published in 1708), {{did not have a}} boat, and therefore could not explore the various islets as Tafforet did. No people who later traveled to the island mentioned the bird. In an article written in 1875, the British ornithologist Alfred Newton attempted to identify the bird from Tafforet's description, and hypothesised that it was related to the extinct hoopoe starling (Fregilupus varius), which formerly inhabited nearby Réunion.|$|E
50|$|With {{an average}} length of 40 cm (15.75 in) and the largest known {{specimen}} at 94 cm (37 in), this is the sixth-largest <b>tortoise</b> species on Earth, after the Galapagos <b>tortoise,</b> the Aldabra <b>tortoise,</b> the African spurred <b>tortoise</b> (Geochelone sulcata, typical size 76 cm (30 in)), the leopard <b>tortoise</b> (Stigmochelys pardalis), and the Asian forest <b>tortoise</b> (Manouria emys emys, typical size 60 cm (23.6 in)).|$|R
50|$|Red <b>tortoise</b> cake molds are an {{important}} tool when making red <b>tortoise</b> cakes. Apart from molding the red <b>tortoise</b> cakes into perfectly round or oval shapes, these molds are also used to imprint patterns onto the surfaces of the red <b>tortoise</b> cakes. Usually carved out of wood or molded from plastics, {{there are many different}} types of red <b>tortoise</b> cake molds available on the market. There are also red <b>tortoise</b> molds that create floral patterns instead of the <b>tortoise</b> shell pattern seen on traditional red <b>tortoise</b> cakes. These molds are used to enhance the aesthetic value of red <b>tortoise</b> cakes and there is no cultural significance attached to the differing designs on these molds.|$|R
50|$|The Russian <b>tortoise</b> (Agrionemys horsfieldii), also {{commonly}} known as Horsfield's <b>tortoise</b> or the Central Asian <b>tortoise,</b> is a threatened species of <b>tortoise.</b> Human activities in its native habitat contribute to its threatened status.|$|R
