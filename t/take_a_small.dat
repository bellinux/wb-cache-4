25|$|After {{sitting for}} early {{graduation}} exams at age 17, Ledger left school {{to pursue an}} acting career. With Trevor DiCarlo, his best friend since he was three years old, Ledger drove across Australia from Perth to Sydney, returning to Perth to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> role in Clowning Around (1992), {{the first part of}} a two-part television series, and to work on the TV series Sweat (1996), in which he played a gay cyclist. From 1993 to 1997, Ledger also had parts in the Perth television series Ship to Shore (1993); in the short-lived Fox Broadcasting Company fantasy-drama Roar (1997); in Home and Away (1997), one of Australia's most successful television shows; and in the Australian film Blackrock (1997), his feature film debut. In 1999, he starred in the teen comedy 10 Things I Hate About You and in the acclaimed Australian crime film Two Hands, directed by Gregor Jordan.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} Vincejo came to intercept, {{after a long}} chase and a warning shot, a large (6-700 ton (bm)) vessel. She {{turned out to be}} the Hercules, of Boston, and hence neutral, with no {{apparent}} cargo. The American captain explained to Long that Hercules had taken cargo to Leghorn, sold it there, and then had agreed to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> number of invalid French officers to a French port where he might find a return cargo for the United States. Long was suspicious and ordered Hercules to accompany him overnight in Long's hope that they might encounter Cockburn and that he would decide what to do with the American vessel. Next day, when it turned out that Minerve was nowhere in sight, Long released the American vessel, which sailed off to Nice. Later, the British learned that Hercules had been ballasted with brass guns (violating her neutrality), and had hidden aboard her French plunder in the form of statues, pictures, plate, and the like.|$|E

He had his first serious romantic relationship, living with John Perry, an {{unsuccessful}} actor, later a writer, who remained a lifelong friend after their affair ended. Morley makes the point that, like Coward, Gielgud's principal passion was the stage; both men had casual dalliances, but were more comfortable with [...] "low-maintenance" [...] long-term partners who did not impede their theatrical work and ambitions.|$|E
500|$|Cambridge's trial {{boats were}} named Fuerte and Listo (strong and clever in Spanish) with the club's {{president}} Henry Hoffstot occupying the latter's number seven seat. [...] Fuerte made the better start but by Barn Elms, the crews were level. [...] With the umpire having to warn both crews for encroaching into each other's water at Fulham, Fuertes Luke Juckett caught a crab, allowing Listo to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> lead. [...] Fuerte regained the advantage under Hammersmith Bridge and were a length ahead by Chiswick Eyot. [...] Taking {{advantage of the}} clear water, Fuerte moved across in front of Listo, and rowed on to win by four lengths.|$|E
500|$|After {{the crew}} had made it to Elephant Island, Shackleton decided to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> crew and make for South Georgia, {{where there was a}} {{possibility}} that they would find crews from the whaling ships to help effect a rescue {{for the rest of the}} men. McNish was called upon by Shackleton to make the James Caird seaworthy for the long voyage and was selected as part of the crew, possibly because Shackleton was afraid of the effect he would have on morale if left behind with the other men. For his part, McNish seemed happy to go; he was unimpressed by the island and the chances of survival for the men overwintering there: ...|$|E

500|$|The Texian cavalry joined their infantrymen. [...] Burleson's father, James Burleson, led a cavalry {{advance on}} the Mexican position, yelling, [...] "Boys, we have but once to die, {{they are here}} in the ditch. [...] Charge them!" [...] The Mexican {{artillery}} fired three times, driving the Texians back. [...] Three times the Mexican cavalry attempted to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> rise to give the artillery better position; they were repulsed. [...] The Mexican infantry then attacked. [...] Rusk wrote of the Mexican attack: [...] "These men advanced with great coolness and bravery under a destructive fire from our men, preserving... strict order and exhibiting no confusion." [...] The infantry abandoned their charge when they realized that Texian James Swisher had led a band of cavalry {{to try to take}} the Mexican cannon. [...] The Mexican forces then withdrew towards Béxar.|$|E
500|$|As a result, Wham!'s [...] "Club Tropicana" [...] {{was shot}} at the hotel in 1983. The video was {{directed}} by Duncan Gibbins with scenes shot of George Michael, the lead singer of the band and his fellow band member Andrew Ridgeley and their backing singers Dee C. Lee and Shirlie Holliman. The scenario saw George Michael [...] "floating about on a lilo in his Speedoes and shades", relaxing with the boys by Pike’s pool sipping cocktails. The scene of the trumpet-playing {{took place in the}} pool itself. Tony Pike got on well with the band and he was persuaded to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> part in the video as the barman in one of the scenes. The success of the video and Wham!'s status at the time firmly placed Pike’s Hotel in the circles of the music industry and within a short time the hotel was attracting other stars and people connected to the industry.|$|E
500|$|In Book Three, Ocean Continents, the Wanli Emperor {{launches}} {{an invasion}} against Nippon (Japan) but the huge fleet is swept {{out to sea}} by the Kuroshio Current and they are set adrift on the unexplored Pacific Ocean. The fleet hopes to be brought back to China eventually by the great circular currents of the Pacific, but they accidentally discover the New World. The sailors make landfall on the West coast of North America and {{make contact with the}} indigenous population (the peaceful Miwok people), but quickly leave once Admiral Kheim discovers they have inadvertently infected the indigenous people with devastating diseases. They <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> girl with them (who they have taught Chinese and named [...] "Butterfly") and sail south where they meet another civilization rich in gold. There they narrowly escape being ritually sacrificed by using their flintlock firearms, something the natives have never seen before. They eventually return to China and tell the Emperor that he could easily conquer this new land and gain its great wealth.|$|E

500|$|It {{quickly became}} {{apparent}} that Elephant Island, [...] of rock and ice with little shelter, was not a welcoming environment particularly with winter approaching {{and most of the}} expedition members weakened by their ordeal. Furthermore, the expedition could not be expected to be spotted by search parties or passing whalers. Within days of landing on Elephant Island, Shackleton decided to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> party and sail the largest lifeboat, the James Caird, named for one of the expedition's sponsors, to South Georgia, [...] away. From there he would obtain a ship and return for the remainder of his men. [...] Worsley, whose navigational skills had impressed Shackleton, volunteered to accompany him. [...] The James Caird, originally built to Worsley's specifications, was about [...] long and the expedition's carpenter, Harry McNish, immediately set about improving its seaworthiness. On 24 April, the weather dawned clear and after being provisioned with 30 days of supplies, the boat left Elephant Island. Worsley was faced with the task of navigating the Southern Ocean to South Georgia. There was no margin for error as the James Caird would sail into the South Atlantic if he missed the island; this would mean almost certain death for those in the lifeboat but also those remaining on Elephant Island. [...] Fortuitously, the weather was fine on the day of departure from the island and this allowed Worsley to obtain a sun sighting to ensure that his chronometer was rated.|$|E
500|$|Leigh's friends {{suggested}} she <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{role as a}} schoolgirl in the film Things Are Looking Up, which was her film debut, albeit uncredited as an extra. She engaged an agent, John Gliddon, who believed that [...] "Vivian Holman" [...] was not a suitable name for an actress. After rejecting his many suggestions, she took [...] "Vivian Leigh" [...] as her professional name. Gliddon recommended her to Alexander Korda as a possible film actress, but Korda rejected her as lacking potential. She was cast in the play The Mask of Virtue, directed by Sidney Carroll in 1935, and received excellent reviews, followed by interviews and newspaper articles. One such article was from the Daily Express, in which the interviewer noted [...] "a lightning change came over her face", {{which was the first}} public mention of the rapid changes in mood which had become characteristic of her. John Betjeman, the future poet laureate, described her as [...] "the essence of English girlhood". Korda attended her opening night performance, admitted his error, and signed her to a film contract. She continued with the play but, when Korda moved it to a larger theatre, Leigh was found to be unable to project her voice adequately or to hold the attention of so large an audience, and the play closed soon after. In the playbill, Carroll had revised the spelling of her first name to [...] "Vivien".|$|E

2500|$|A {{loss leader}} {{is a product}} that has a price set below the {{operating}} margin. Loss leadering is widely used in supermarkets and [...] budget-priced retail outlets where {{it is intended to}} generate store traffic. The low price is widely promoted and the store is prepared to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> loss on an individual item, with an expectation that it will recoup that loss when customers purchase other higher priced-higher margin items. In service industries, loss leadering may refer to the practice of charging a reduced price on the first order as an inducement and with anticipation of charging higher prices on subsequent orders.|$|E
2500|$|The dungeoneer then enters Treguard's partly computer-generated, partly {{hand-drawn}} fantasy dungeon {{which was}} accomplished through blue screen chroma key — hence {{the need for}} the helmet, as the dungeoneer otherwise just sees a large blue room. The team watches the dungeoneer from a screen in the antechamber, and guides the player using hurried descriptions and shouted instructions, overcoming a variety of puzzles and traps in the dungeon. The instructions might be [...] "Sidestep left, walk forward, <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> step to your right, pick up the key", much like many text-based computer games (for example the appropriately named [...] "multi-user dungeons") which rely on description and commands rather than any visuals.|$|E

On {{the left of the}} division, the 89th Brigade attacked on the right with the 2nd Bedfordshire, which tried to bomb up the Gird trenches but were only able to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> length of Bite Trench. On the left, the 7th King's Liverpool was stopped by enfilade fire from the north-west, the preliminary bombardment having failed to suppress the German machine-guns, which were dispersed over a wide area.|$|E
