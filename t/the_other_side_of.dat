5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach {{the doors of the}} Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate {{at the top of the}} steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E

5000|$|Thor {{frequently}} crosses {{rivers in}} the mythology; John Lindow suggests {{this is due}} to the large amount of time he spends in the realms of the jötnar, [...] "who live on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> boundaries", and points to a symbolic connection between jötnar and water, citing the ocean-dwelling Jörmungandr as an example.|$|R
