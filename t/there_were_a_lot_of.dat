Among the visitors who came to see the Xian Wall were American captain (later general) Stilwell in 1922 and the Czech sinologist Jaroslav Průšek (1906–1980) in 1933. In 1983, the administration of the Xi'an municipality carried out more renovations and additions to the wall. At that time, the Yangmacheng tower, the Zhalou sluice tower, the Kuixinglou dipper tower, the Jiaolou corner tower and the Dilou defense tower were all refurbished; the crumbling parts of the rampart were changed into gates; and the moat was restored. In May 2005, all of Xi'an's ramparts were inter-connected.|$|E

For Normandy, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> {{fluctuations}} {{relative to the}} politics of the Duchy. The Norman revenues were only £6,750 in 1180, then they reached £25,000 a year in 1198, higher than in England. What was more impressive was the fact the Norman population was considerably smaller than England's, an estimated 1.5 million as opposed to England's 3.5 million. This period has become known as the 'Norman Fiscal Revolution' due to this increase in revenue.|$|E

25|$|Jean de Mailly, a French Dominican at Metz, {{places the}} story in the year 1099, in his , which dates from {{approximately}} 1250 and gives what is almost certainly the earliest authentic account of the woman who became known as Pope Joan. His compatriot Stephen of Bourbon acknowledges this by placing her rule at approximately 1100. Also, Rosemary and Darrell Pardoe, authors of The Female Pope: The Mystery of Pope Joan. The First Complete Documentation of the Facts behind the Legend, are assuming that a more plausible time-frame would be 1086–1108, when <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> antipopes, and the reign of the legitimate popes Victor III, Urban II, and Paschal II was not always established in Rome, since this city was occupied by Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and later sacked by the Normans.|$|E

Thirdly, left-arm spinner Maninder Singh was the best bowler for India with 14 wickets and was the best spinner of the tournament, coming at 4th place among the tournament's highest wicket takers, with only fast bowlers Craig McDermott, Imran Khan and Patrick Patterson above him.

500|$|In 2006, Laurie Olin {{said the}} Halprin's Portland {{sequence}} was [...] "a huge influence on even becoming a landscape architect. I {{had gone off}} to Europe and saw them published there.

[...] "I had just worked on a show on another network [...] we had a show where <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> notes from executives", Jean said of the inspiration for the scenes. The episode would originally have a different ending, but it was changed to its current iteration after the writers did not find the original ending humorous enough.

[...] The creator's second stance of choosing her over another singer was because he observed that fans from the first Kingdom Hearts associated Utada with the franchise. Regarding the songs concept and connection with the game, Utada derived her inspiration from the worlds and characters in Kingdom Hearts and received in-depth explanations and clues from Nomura. Conversely, Nomura noticed that Utada's theme song [...] "Hikari" [...] influenced several factors in creating the games.|$|E
