2500|$|Each Galileo {{satellite}} has two master passive {{hydrogen maser}} atomic clocks and two secondary rubidium atomic clocks which {{are independent of}} one other. As precise and stable space-qualified atomic clocks are critical components to any satellite-navigation system, the employed quadruple redundancy keeps Galileo functioning when onboard atomic clocks fail in space. The onboard passive hydrogen maser clocks' precision is four times better than the onboard rubidium atomic clocks and estimated at 1 second per 3 million years (a <b>timing</b> <b>error</b> of a nanosecond or 1 billionth of a second (10âˆ’9 or 1/1,000,000,000 s) translates into a [...] positional error on Earth's surface), and will provide an accurate timing signal to allow a receiver to calculate {{the time that it}} takes the signal to reach it. The Galileo satellites are configured to run one hydrogen maser clock in primary mode and a rubidium clock as hot backup. Under normal conditions, the operating hydrogen maser clock produces the reference frequency from which the navigation signal is generated. Should the hydrogen maser encounter any problem, an instantaneous switchover to the rubidium clock would be performed. In case of a failure of the primary hydrogen maser the secondary hydrogen maser could be activated by the ground segment to take over within a period of days as part of the redundant system. A clock monitoring and control unit provides the interface between the four clocks and the navigation signal generator unit (NSU). It passes the signal from the active hydrogen master clock to the NSU and also ensures that the frequencies produced by the master clock and the active spare are in phase, so that the spare can take over instantly should the master clock fail. The NSU information is used to calculate the position of the receiver by trilaterating the difference in received signals from multiple satellites.|$|E

40|$|A parallel-processing {{algorithm}} and {{a hardware}} architecture {{to implement the}} algorithm have been devised for timeslot synchronization in the reception of pulse-position-modulated (PPM) optical or radio signals. As {{in the cases of}} some prior algorithms and architectures for parallel, discrete-time, digital processing of signals other than PPM, an incoming broadband signal is divided into multiple parallel narrower-band signals by means of sub-sampling and filtering. The number of parallel streams is chosen so that the frequency content of the narrower-band signals is low enough to enable processing by relatively-low speed complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronic circuitry. The algorithm and architecture are intended to satisfy requirements for time-varying time-slot synchronization and post-detection filtering, with correction of <b>timing</b> <b>errors</b> independent of estimation of <b>timing</b> <b>errors.</b> They are also intended to afford flexibility for dynamic reconfiguration and upgrading.

40|$|Iterative decoders such as Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) and turbo decoders have an {{inherent}} capability {{to correct the}} transmission errors that originate during communication over a hostile wireless channel. This capability has engendered {{the widespread use of}} LDPC and turbo decoders in current communications standards. As a result, signficant research efforts have been made in order to conceive efficient Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) implementations of both LDPC and turbo decoders. Typically, these efforts have focused on optimizing only one of the various trade-offs associated with the hardware implementation of iterative decoders, such as the chip area, latency, throughput, energy efficiency or Bit Error Ratio (BER) performance. However, tolerance to <b>timing</b> <b>errors</b> that occur during the iterative decoding processing are typically not considered in these implementations. Owing to this, the BER performance and hardware efficiency of the proposed designs may be severely degraded, if <b>timing</b> <b>errors</b> occur during the iterative decoding process. Against this background, this thesis demonstrates that iterative decoders are capable of exploiting their inherent error correction capability to correct not only transmission <b>errors,</b> but also <b>timing</b> <b>errors</b> caused by overclocking and power supply variations. Moreover,we propose modifications to the iterative decoders designs, which further enhance their inherent tolerance to <b>timing</b> <b>errors.</b> We achieve this by considering the close relationship between the different trade-offs associated with the hardware implementation of iterative decoders, with the aim of achieving Pareto optimality, where none of these trade-offs can be further improved without degrading {{at least one of the}} others. Owing to this, our proposed timing-error-tolerant design methodology simultaneously considers the design constraints and parameters that affect not only the BER performance, but also the hardware efficiency of each implementation. We first investigate the benefits of stochastic computing in iterative decoders, by characterizing the inherent timing-error tolerance of Stochastic LDPC Decoders (SLDPCDs) and Stochastic Turbo Decoders (STDs). Moreover, we propose modifications to the SLDPCD and STD in order to further improve their inherent tolerance to <b>timing</b> <b>errors.</b> This is achieved by performing extensive transistor-level and post-layout simulations, in order to develop different timing analyses for determining the causes and effects of <b>timing</b> <b>errors</b> in these stochastic decoders. Following this, we propose a novel Reduced-Latency STD (RLSTD), which improves the latency of the state-of-the-art STD by an order of magnitude, without increasing its chip area or energy consumption. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed RLSTD achieves ultra-low-latencies required by next-generation Mission-Critical Machine-Type Communication (MCMTC). We also investigate the inherent tolerance to <b>timing</b> <b>errors</b> of a recently-proposed Fully-Parallel Turbo Decoder (FPTD). Furthermore, we propose a novel Reduced-Critical-Path Fully-Parallel Turbo Decoder (RCP-FPTD) algorithm and the employment of Better-Than-Worst-Case (BTWC) design techniques in FPTD and RCP-FPTD implementations, for the sake of improving their throughput and their tolerance to <b>timing</b> <b>errors</b> caused by overclocking. We demonstrate that the FPTD and RCP-FPTD implementations improve the throughput of the state-of-the-art turbo decoder by an order of magnitude. Finally, despite operating in the presence of <b>timing</b> <b>errors,</b> our proposed Better-Than-Worst-Case Reduced-Critical-Path Fully-Parallel Turbo Decoder (BTWC-RCP-FPTD) achieves throughputs on the order of tens of Gbps, which may be expected to be a requirement in next-generation wireless communication standards...|$|R
