5|$|Under the Köppen climate {{classification}} system, Manila has {{a tropical}} savanna climate (Köppen climate classification Aw). Together {{with the rest}} of the Philippines, Manila lies entirely within the tropics. Its proximity to the equator means that the temperature range is very small, rarely going below 20°C or above 38°C. <b>Temperature</b> <b>extremes</b> have ranged from 14.5°C on January 11, 1914, to 38.6°C on May 7, 1915.|$|E
5|$|The Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{is a key}} factor in sustaining the ecosystem. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. The ozone layer {{plays an important role in}} depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily <b>temperature</b> <b>extremes.</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} <b>extreme</b> <b>temperature</b> and <b>extreme</b> {{precipitation}} changes in Guangxi Province of south China, which has experienced increased numbers of climate disasters in recent years. In this paper, {{spatial and temporal}} changes in <b>extreme</b> <b>temperature</b> and <b>extreme</b> precipitation were reconstructed for the period 1960 - 2009. The method of FFT filtering was used to smooth time series of <b>extreme</b> <b>temperature</b> and <b>extreme</b> precipitation, linear regression to calculate linear fits, and spline interpolation to interpolate station data and estimate linear changes. The {{results show that the}} annual <b>extreme</b> <b>temperature</b> increased in most of the area during 1960 - 2009, especially in the northeast. The greatest increase was the <b>extreme</b> <b>temperature</b> in winter, compared to that in autumn, summer and spring in order from high to low across most of the study area. The annual extreme precipitation changed little in the first three decades and increased significantly in the last two decades, and varied with region and season. Spatially, the annual trend of extreme precipitation increased across most of the province, except in some areas of the southeast. The seasonal change trend of extreme precipitation varied greatly across different areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Regardless of origin, {{climate and}} culture {{ultimately}} created the Arabian. The desert environment required a domesticated horse {{to cooperate with}} humans to survive; humans were the only providers {{of food and water}} in certain areas, and even hardy Arabian horses needed far more water than camels in order to survive (most horses can only live about 72hours without water). Where there was no pasture or water, the Bedouin fed their horses dates and camel's milk. The desert horse needed the ability to thrive on very little food, and to have anatomical traits to compensate for life in a dry climate with wide <b>temperature</b> <b>extremes</b> from day to night. Weak individuals were weeded out of the breeding pool, and the animals that remained were also honed by centuries of human warfare.|$|E
5|$|The {{complex of}} {{refining}} and chemical companies is called Chemical Valley and located south of downtown Sarnia. While in 2011 {{the city had}} {{the highest level of}} particulates air pollution of any Canadian city, it has since dropped down to 30th. About 60 percent of the particulate matter, however, comes from the neighboring United States. Lake Huron is cooler than the air in summer and warmer than the air in winter; therefore, it moderates Sarnia's humid continental climate, which makes <b>temperature</b> <b>extremes</b> of hot and cold less evident. In the winter, Sarnia occasionally experiences lake-effect snow from Arctic air blowing across the warmer waters of Lake Huron and condensing to form snow squalls once over land.|$|E
5|$|Dry land is also {{important}} as it provides opportunities for basking, nesting, and escaping from <b>temperature</b> <b>extremes.</b> Gaping allows evaporation of moisture from the mouth lining and has a cooling effect, and several species make use of shallow burrows on land to keep cool. Wallowing in mud can also help prevent them from overheating. Four species of crocodilians climb trees to bask in areas lacking a shoreline. The type of vegetation bordering the rivers and lakes inhabited by crocodilians is mostly humid tropical forest, with mangrove swamps in estuarine areas. These forests are of great importance to the crocodilians, creating suitable microhabitats where they can flourish. The roots of the trees absorb water when it rains, releasing it back slowly into the environment. When the forests are cleared {{to make way for}} agriculture, rivers tend to silt up, the water runs off rapidly, the water courses can dry up in the dry season and flooding can occur in the wet season. Destruction of forest habitat is probably a greater threat to crocodilians than is hunting.|$|E
