40|$|Abstract-The {{white pine}} cone beetle, Conophthorus coniperda, {{exhibited}} dose and enantiospecific responses to a-pinene in stands of mature eastern white pine, Pinus strobus, in a seed orchard near Murphy, North Carolina, USA. (-) -IX-Pinene significantly increased catches of cone beetles <b>to</b> <b>traps</b> baited with (f) -trans-pityol. (+) -a-Pinene {{did not increase}} catches of beetles <b>to</b> pityol-baited <b>traps</b> and interrupted the response of beetles <b>to</b> <b>traps</b> baited with (f) -rruns-pity 01 and (-) -cu-pinene. Maximal attraction of cone beetles <b>to</b> pityol-baited <b>traps</b> was obtained with lures releasing (-) -a-pinene {{at a rate of}} 103 mg/day at 23 °C. Lures releasing (-) -c~-pinene at rates lower or higher than 103 mg/day resulted in reduced catches <b>to</b> <b>traps</b> baited with (f) -trans-pityol. The sex ratio in all catches was heavily male biased. Attraction of the clerid predator, Thanasimus dubius, <b>to</b> <b>traps</b> baited with (f) -trans-pity 01 increased significantly with the presence of cY-pinene, irrespective of enantiomeric composition. Maxima 1 attraction of 7 : dubius <b>to</b> pityol-baited <b>traps</b> occurred with devices releasing (-) -a-pinene at the highest rate tested, 579 mg/d at 23 % a sub optima 1 rate for cone beetles.

5|$|Net-casting spiders weave {{only small}} webs, but then {{manipulate}} them <b>to</b> <b>trap</b> prey. Those {{of the genus}} Hyptiotes and the family Theridiosomatidae stretch their webs and then release them when prey strike them, but do not actively move their webs. Those of the family Deinopidae weave even smaller webs, hold them outstretched between their first two pairs of legs, and lunge and push the webs as much as twice their own body length <b>to</b> <b>trap</b> prey, and this move may increase the webs' area {{by a factor of}} up to ten. Experiments have shown that Deinopis spinosus has two different techniques for trapping prey: backwards strikes to catch flying insects, whose vibrations it detects; and forward strikes to catch ground-walking prey that it sees. These two techniques have also been observed in other deinopids. Walking insects form most of the prey of most deinopids, but one population of Deinopis subrufa appears to live mainly on tipulid flies that they catch with the backwards strike.|$|E

5|$|The {{batteries}} in OR–7's Global Positioning System tracking unit expired in October 2015. Officials decided {{to replace the}} collar {{in order to keep}} track of the pack, which is protected under Oregon law and the federal Endangered Species Act. However, attempts <b>to</b> <b>trap</b> OR-7 or other members of the pack failed, and further tracking of OR-7 depended on trail cameras and live sightings. A trail camera in the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest captured an image of OR-7 and one of his offspring in early 2016. After four steers were killed by wolves in Wood River Valley in western Klamath County (immediately east of Jackson County) near where OR–7 was last seen, biologists said efforts <b>to</b> <b>trap</b> and re-collar the wolf would likely resume and that tracking could alert ranchers concerned about their livestock. On October 3, 2017, biologists caught and collared OR-54, another Rogue Pack wolf, thought to be OR-7's daughter, traveling with the pack in Wood River Valley. In lieu of another tracking device on OR-7, the collar on OR-54 will allow officials to track the movements and behaviors of the pack.|$|E
