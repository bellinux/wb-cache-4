40|$|We here {{present a}} {{system based on}} {{multiple}} cues for object recognition containing a new method for color contour selection using color prototype modeled by fuzzy sets. In addition an object representation <b>is</b> presented <b>that</b> enables predictions for an active vision system. The design of the system <b>is</b> motivated by <b>two</b> <b>evaluations</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> also presented here. The extraction of color contours is motivated by an evaluation of a local shape descriptor, shape context, and a local photometric descriptors, SIFT, performance in object recognition on two different data sets. The use of fuzzy color membership functions enables selection of contours by backprojecting the membership function and detecting edges in the membership map. The utility {{of this approach is}} tested by its use in contour recognition, using shape context, in cluttered environments. ...|$|R

40|$|Utility {{computing}} {{has been}} anticipated {{to be the}} next generation of computing usage. Users have the freedom to easily switch to any commercial computing service to complete jobs whenever the need arises and simply pay only on usage, without any investment costs. A commercial computing service however has certain objectives or goals that it aims to achieve. In this paper, we identify three essential objectives for a commercial computing service: (i) meet SLA, (ii) maintain reliability, and (iii) earn profit. This leads to the problem of whether a resource management policy implemented in the commercial computing service is able to meet the required objectives or not. So, we also develop <b>two</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods <b>that</b> <b>are</b> simple and intuitive: (i) separate and (ii) integrated risk analysis to analyze the effectiveness of resource management policies in achieving the required objectives. Evaluation results based on five policies successfully demonstrate the applicability of separate and integrated risk analysis to assess policies in terms of the required objectives. 1...|$|R

40|$|Two {{methods are}} {{commonly}} used by transmission system operators to evaluate the stability performance of a power system stabilizer (PSS). However, cases have been encountered where the <b>two</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods do not agree. This is problematic since it may affect {{the stability of the}} power system. In this study it is investigated and suggested which of <b>two</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods <b>that</b> <b>is</b> better to use when evaluating the stability performance of a PSS. This study is based on dynamic simulations of the Nordic 32 -system where PSS 2 Bs are placed at different synchronous machines <b>that</b> <b>are</b> located at different buses in the power system; then, the impact of tuning the PSS 2 Bs according to the <b>two</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods is analyzed by the traditional method of eigenvalue analysis. The eigenvalue analysis shows that tuning of the PSS 2 Bs according to the evaluation method used by Statnett results in higher increases in the damping ratios of the complex eigenvalues with imaginary parts in the range of 0. 6 - 6. 3 rad/s compared with tuning of the PSS 2 Bs according to the evaluation method used by National Grid. Therefore, for the specific cases simulated, it <b>is</b> suggested <b>that</b> the <b>evaluation</b> method used by Statnett is better to use for purposes of evaluating the stability performance of a PSS...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} rating {{instruments}} that evaluate {{the quality of}} practice guidelines have been published. Application of these instruments can be difficult and time-consuming. In a literature review, we identified <b>two</b> <b>evaluation</b> instruments <b>that</b> <b>are</b> comprehensive, have clearly defined constructs, and have undergone validation/testing—the Guidelines Quality Assessment Questionnaire (GQAQ) and the Appraisal Instrument for Clinical Guidelines (AICG). Overall, the AICG is more comprehensive. The AICG addresses the implementability of a guideline, which is not evaluated by the GQAQ. However, the GQAQ is more amenable to computerization. GEM-Q is a Guideline Elements Model (GEM) -derived application intended to facilitate automated evaluation of guideline quality {{using one of the}} published instruments. To develop GEM-Q, various items in the GQAQ were mapped to corresponding elements in the GEM hierarchy and a customized XSL stylesheet was designed based on this mapping. GEM-Q selectively extracts text components of the guideline relevant to quality evaluation and displays the results in HTML format. GEM-Q was applied to a set of six guidelines to test its reliability. It ranked two guidelines as of “good ” quality, two as “intermediate”, and two as “poor”. In all six instances, GEM-Q ranked guidelines in the same order of quality as the experts who validated the GQAQ.

40|$|We present BEAMER: a new {{spatially}} exploitative {{approach to}} learning object detectors which shows excellent results when applied {{to the task of}} detecting objects in greyscale aerial imagery in the presence of ambiguous and noisy data. There are four main contributions used to produce these results. First, we introduce a grammar-guided feature extraction system, enabling the exploration of a richer feature space while constraining the features to a useful subset. This is specified with a rule-based generative grammar crafted by a human expert. Second, we learn a classifier on this data using a newly proposed variant of AdaBoost which takes into account the spatially correlated nature of the data. Third, we perform another round of training to optimize the method of converting the pixel classifications generated by boosting into a high quality set of (x, y) locations. Lastly, we carefully define three common problems in object detection and define <b>two</b> <b>evaluation</b> criteria <b>that</b> <b>are</b> tightly matched to these problems. Major strengths of this approach are: (1) a way of randomly searching a broad feature space, (2) its performance when evaluated on well-matched evaluation criteria, and (3) its use of the location prediction domain to learn object detectors as well as to generate detections that perform well on several tasks: object counting, tracking, and target detection. We demonstrate the efficacy of BEAMER with a comprehensive experimental evaluation on a challenging data set...|$|R

Method: Functional evaluations of stroke cases were performed with total FIM and FIM motor tests of functional independence scale (FIM) and cognitive evaluations were performed with mini-mental state evaluation (MMSE) and FIM cognitive tests. Results: No statistical difference was found between normal and impaired MMSE groups according to age, gender, education and lesion side (p> 0. 05). There was difference between normal and impaired MMSE groups in terms of FIM motor and FIM total evaluations (p= 0. 00). There was {{a significant relationship between}} MMSE and FIM motor and FIM total evaluations. There was a significant relation between FIM cognitive test and FIM total evaluation. There was a significant relation between MMSE and cognitive FIM test. Coclusion: In stroke patients impaired cognitive function affects functional state negatively.

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{technological}} advances in grid computing enable the virtualization and dynamic delivery of computing services on demand to realize utility computing. In utility computing, computing services {{will always be}} available to the users whenever the need arises, similar to the availability of real-world utilities, such as electrical power, gas, and water. With this new outsourcing service model, users are able to define their service needs through Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and only have to pay when they use the services. They do not have to invest on or maintain computing infrastructures themselves and are not constrained to specific computing service providers. Thus, a commercial computing service will face two new challenges: (i) what are the objectives or goals it needs to achieve in order to support the utility computing model, and (ii) how to evaluate whether these objectives are achieved or not. To address these two new challenges, this paper first identifies four essential objectives <b>that</b> <b>are</b> required to support the utility computing model: (i) manage wait time for SLA acceptance, (ii) meet SLA requests, (iii) ensure reliability of accepted SLA, and (iv) attain profitability. It then describes <b>two</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods <b>that</b> <b>are</b> simple and intuitive: (i) separate and (ii) integrated risk analysis to analyze the effectiveness of resource management policies in achieving the objectives. Evaluation results based on simulation successfully demonstrate the applicability of separate and integrated risk analysis to assess policies in terms of the objectives. These evaluation results which constitute an a posteriori risk analysis of policies can later be used to generate an a priori risk analysis of policies by identifying possible risks for future utility computing situations...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{generated}} research data is growing exponentially. Following this trend, many universities and research institutes require their researchers to plan research data management before commencing a new research project. Research data {{is a valuable}} product of research process. Without proper management, the value of research data cannot be utilized properly. As the largest university in Finland {{in the field of}} engineering, Aalto University has defined its research data management policy. The policy aims to make research data management easier and it requires Aalto University to find the most suitable platforms to be used for its research data management. Currently Aalto University has four available options for its research data management platform and EUDAT services are considered {{as one of the best}} candidate for Aalto University research data management platform. EUDAT is a pan European project which offers common data services and it is funded by European Union. However, it is still unclear how useful EUDAT services would be for researchers in Aalto University. This thesis evaluates the current state of usability and user experience of four EUDAT services: B 2 DROP, B 2 SHARE, B 2 FIND, and B 2 ACCESS. In addition to that, this thesis also evaluates the functionalities <b>that</b> <b>are</b> available on those services. There <b>are</b> <b>two</b> usability <b>evaluation</b> methods <b>that</b> <b>are</b> used to evaluate EUDAT services: feature inspection and usability testing. The results from those <b>two</b> <b>evaluations</b> show <b>that</b> B 2 DROP and B 2 FIND have few usability problems and the available functionalities are good enough for researchers in Aalto University. On the other hand, the results show that B 2 SHARE and B 2 ACCESS need to be improved significantly before it can be widely used by researchers in Aalto University. This mainly caused by existing usability problems with significant impact <b>that</b> need to <b>be</b> fixed first...|$|R

This work aimed at evaluating the effect of 6 - and 10 -MV photon energies on intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment plan outcome in different selected diagnostic cases. For such purpose, 19 patients, with different types of non CNS solid tumers, were selected. Clinical step-and-shoot IMRT treatment plans were designed for delivery on a Siemens Oncor accelerator with 82 leafs; multi-leaf collimators (MLCs). To ensure that the similarity or difference among the plans is due to energy alone, the same optimization constraints were applied for both energy plans. All the parame-ters like beam angles, number of beams, were kept constant {{to achieve the same}} clinical objectives. The Comparative evaluation was based on dose-volumetric analysis of both energy IMRT plans. Both qualitative and quantitative meth-ods were used. Several physical indices for Planning Target Volume (PTV), the relevant Organs at Risk (OARs) as mean dose (Dmean), maximum dose (Dmax), 95 % dose (D 95), integral dose, total number of segments, and the number of MU were applied. Homogeneity index and conformation number <b>were</b> <b>two</b> other <b>evaluation</b> parameters <b>that</b> <b>were</b> considered in this study.

40|$|The {{benefits}} {{of physical activity}} for adolescent children are well understood. Despite this, within much of the Western World, children fail to achieve the recommended guidelines for physical activity participation, {{spending too much time}} on sedentary activities. Thanks to recent progressions in ubiquitous technologies, exergames - exercise video games - have emerged as a potential solution to the problem. By facilitating physical activity, and encouraging behavioural change within an enjoyable and motivating context, exergames have the potential to remove some of the barriers preventing many adolescents from sufficient physical activity participation. There are, however, few studies of exergame systems that have looked at the impact of the system over time. Additionally, many systems are not evaluated within ecologically valid contexts. The result of this is a lack of real understanding on the efficacy of exergame systems and their feasibility as a valid solution. This thesis investigates the design, development, and evaluation of a locationaware exergame for adolescent children: iFitQuest. Through analysis of two prolonged use school-based evaluations, this research provides evidence on the ability of exergames to facilitate physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour, when targeted at adolescent children within a school context. The results of <b>two</b> <b>evaluations</b> suggest <b>that</b> iFitQuest <b>was</b> enjoyable, motivating, and physically demanding, with the ability to promote physical activity of all intensities in players with a range of attitudes towards physical activity, their own physical activity abilities, and physical activity participation backgrounds. The primary contribution of this thesis is the indepth evaluation of the exergame user experience. Looking beyond the general success of the system, the experience of individual players was analysed through the lens of Bandura's theory of self-efficacy. Through a mixed-methods case study analysis, self-efficacy was established as an accurate method to explain and understand in-game behaviour, in particular with respect to goal setting and game selection habits. By influencing and moderating the players' motivation, attitude and in-game behaviour, self-efficacy was established as a useful tool for future exergame practitioners. Guidelines on the application of self-efficacy are provided, with respect to both analysis and design. Additionally, through a naturalistic and prolonged evaluation, a number of logistical and contextual lessons for the evaluation of exergames were established. In particular, the use of a user-centred design approach for the development of similar systems is validated through a series of design guidelines, which account for the importance and influence of the evaluation context...|$|R
