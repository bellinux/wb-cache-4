5|$|Historian James C. Klotter has speculated that, had John C. Breckinridge's father, Cabell, lived, {{he would}} have steered his son to the Whig Party and the Union, rather than the Democratic Party and the Confederacy, but the Kentucky Secretary of State and former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives died of a fever on September 1, 1823, months before his son's third birthday. Burdened with her husband's debts, widow Mary Breckinridge and her {{children}} moved to her in-laws' home near Lexington, Kentucky, where John C. Breckinridge's grandmother taught him the political philosophies of his late grandfather, U.S. Attorney General John Breckinridge. John Breckinridge believed {{the federal government was}} created by, and subject to, the co-equal governments of the states. As a state representative, he introduced the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 and 1799, which denounced the Alien and Sedition Acts and asserted that states could nullify them and other federal laws that they deemed unconstitutional. A strict constructionist, he held that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> only exercise powers explicitly given to it in the Constitution.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745 (1966), the Supreme Court {{overruled}} Chief Justice White's {{conclusion that}} <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> protect {{the right to}} travel only against state infringement.|$|E
25|$|Local {{and state}} {{government}} officials started to understand, after several surveys made during {{the latter part of}} the 19th century, that only action by <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> provide water resources needed to support the development of the West. Starting in 1902, Congress passed a series of acts authorizing the establishment of the United States Bureau of Reclamation to oversee water development projects in seventeen western states.|$|E

25|$|Justice White {{concluded}} that {{nothing in the}} record showed that the United States intended to withdraw the riparian water rights of the landholders when it built Water Street and cut the landholders off from the Potomac River. White also engaged in a lengthy discussion of the laying out of the city's boundaries, and the conveyance of private property to <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government.</b> There <b>could</b> be no doubt, White argued, that the private landowners intended to give all of their riparian rights to <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government,</b> and there <b>could</b> {{be no doubt that}} <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> intended to give all riparian rights to those to whom it sold the land. The majority's argument led to a tautology in which no riparian rights existed.|$|R
50|$|Efforts {{to locate}} a {{permanent}} aerodrome site in the city had been proceeding {{for a number of}} years in the 1920s. The City Council and <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government,</b> however, <b>could</b> not come to an arrangement as to a suitable site. Prior to 1930, a number of locations within the city had been used for the operation of aircraft, all on a non-official basis and none suitable for long term use.|$|R
25|$|In {{spite of}} shortcomings, the various colonial militias became {{indispensable}} {{to the cause}} of American independence. They were the back-up for General Washington's Continental Army, providing large numbers of armed men when needed on short notice, and they assured the authority of colonial governors against British sympathizers. Later, the United States Constitution and Militia Act of 1792 provided for continuation of a state-based militia system. <b>The</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> employ the militia for purposes of national security, but its organization was left with the individual states.|$|E
25|$|DADT was {{upheld by}} five federal Courts of Appeal. The Supreme Court, in Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc. (2006), {{unanimously}} held that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> constitutionally withhold funding from universities, {{no matter what}} their nondiscrimination policies might be, for refusing to give military recruiters access to school resources. An association of law schools had argued that allowing military recruiting at their institutions compromised their ability to exercise their free speech rights in opposition to discrimination based on sexual orientation as represented by DADT.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} {{allocation}} of powers to the United States Congress under the United States Constitution, the Constitution of Australia grants a number of specified powers to the Parliament of Australia, while leaving unassigned powers to the state parliaments. Most of the powers granted to the federal parliament can also be exercised by the state parliaments, though because of section 109 of the Australian Constitution federal laws will prevail in case of inconsistency. This arrangement resulted in a constitutional dispute as to whether <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> be subject to state laws, and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|In 1895 the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council {{ruled that}} <b>the</b> Canadian <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> pass {{remedial}} legislation to overrule the Manitoba Schools Act (see Disallowance and reservation). Therefore, in February 1896 Tupper introduced this remedial {{legislation in the}} House of Commons. The bill was filibustered {{by a combination of}} extreme Protestants led by McCarthy and Liberals led by Wilfrid Laurier. This filibuster resulted in Tupper's abandoning the bill and asking for a dissolution.|$|R
50|$|On May 1, 1871, the Court ruled 5-4 to {{overturn}} Hepburn v Griswold (1870), {{and to find}} the Legal Tender Act Constitutional, for both pre-existing debt and in the general concept that <b>the</b> US <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> not only mint coin, but print money. The remaining members on the Court from the majority in Hepburn were the four dissenters in Knox v Lee (1871). The two new justices appointed by President Grant were the deciding factor.|$|R
25|$|The {{amendments}} {{enacted in}} Taft–Hartley added {{a list of}} prohibited actions, or unfair labor practices, {{on the part of}} unions to the NLRA, which had previously only prohibited unfair labor practices committed by employers. The Taft–Hartley Act prohibited jurisdictional strikes, wildcat strikes, solidarity or political strikes, secondary boycotts, secondary and mass picketing, closed shops, and monetary donations by unions to federal political campaigns. It also required union officers to sign non-communist affidavits with the government. Union shops were heavily restricted, and states were allowed to pass right-to-work laws that ban agency fees. Furthermore, the executive branch of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> obtain legal strikebreaking injunctions if an impending or current strike imperiled the national health or safety.|$|E
25|$|Combs {{held that}} the state's sedition law was unconstitutional and petitioned the federal {{judiciary}} to overturn it. Combs said he had reached an agreement with Ratliff not to seek indictments for the McSurelys until {{the constitutionality of the}} sedition law was settled; however, Judge James B. Stephenson instructed the grand jury that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> not stop them from investigating and returning an indictment. The trial dragged on for years, with Combs appearing as a witness on the couple's behalf in 1982. The sedition law was eventually found unconstitutional, and on January 7, 1983, a federal jury awarded the McSurelys $2 million for violation of the Fourth Amendment rights against illegal search and seizure.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these findings, some detractors {{have pointed out that}} the Davis–Bacon Act requirements were rendered moot by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). At the time that Davis–Bacon Act was passed, legal scholars were divided on the question about whether <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> regulate labor costs and conditions. The Davis–Bacon Act was seen as a legitimate way to control labor wages and conditions on federal projects since there was clear jurisdiction on those. However, as the Depression rolled on, especially after the West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish ruling in 1937, the Roosevelt Administration succeeded in establishing a federal authority to dictate wages, including a federal, universal minimum wage. In the view of some reviewers, this superseded the need for a prevailing wage law specific to federal contracts.|$|E
40|$|This article {{argues that}} the {{socio-economic}} integration of North America is undermining Canadian unity. Continental integration need not produce a North American political union, but it is complicating the "re-constitution" of Canada in response to Quebec's demands for greater autonomy. While the country's fundamental economic and social characteristics are not compatible with a more highly-centralized union, a "bottom up" definition of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government's</b> role <b>could</b> still result in significant central powers. To this extent, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government's</b> proposed amendments to sections 91 and 121 of The Constitution Act, 1982 seem both realistic and desirable. ...|$|R

It examines the strategies of two levels of government, national and local, during a constitutional revision process on the new division of powers. The author shows how the perspective of a fundamental change in the division of powers in Canada can shape the strategy of opposing political groups. Their analysis suggests that, in order to minimize risks of electoral defeat, <b>the</b> Canadian <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> have <b>the</b> incentive to abandon Quebec in favor of the preferences of the Canadian citizens outside Quebec. ...|$|R

The settlers built several towns and forts {{over the next}} few months. They also wrote and ratified their own constitution, indicating the permanent intention of their endeavor. With little overt opposition from the Creek, they were taking control of the lands before <b>the</b> state or <b>federal</b> <b>governments</b> <b>could</b> react.|$|R
25|$|Parliament may invoke {{emergency}} powers under the emergency branch of POGG. This began in 1882, when the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (then the supreme authority over Canadian law) ruled in Russell v. The Queen that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> legislate {{with regard to}} alcohol, because even though this {{would probably have been}} considered provincial jurisdiction in ordinary circumstances, the federal government was acting to ensure order in Canada. This concept further evolved during the 1920s, when in the 1922 Board of Commerce case, it was stated that POGG could be invoked in times of war and famine, to allow Parliament to intervene in matters of provincial jurisdiction. POGG was later used this way in the Anti-Inflation Reference of 1976, when the Supreme Court of Canada allowed Parliament to regulate inflation {{on the grounds that it}} posed a considerable economic problem for Canada. In that case, a great degree of deference was exercised in accepting what the federal government deemed to be an emergency.|$|E
25|$|Some representatives mistrusted {{proposals}} to enlarge federal powers, {{because they were}} concerned about the inherent risks of centralizing power. Federalists, including James Madison, initially argued that a bill of rights was unnecessary, sufficiently confident that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> never raise a standing army powerful enough to overcome a militia. Federalist Noah Webster argued that an armed populace would have no trouble resisting the potential threat to liberty of a standing army. Anti-federalists, on the other hand, advocated amending the Constitution with clearly defined and enumerated rights providing more explicit constraints on the new government. Many Anti-federalists feared the new federal government would choose to disarm state militias. Federalists countered that in listing only certain rights, unlisted rights might lose protection. The Federalists realized there was insufficient support to ratify the Constitution without a bill of rights and so they promised to support amending the Constitution to add a bill of rights following the Constitution's adoption. This compromise persuaded enough Anti-federalists to vote for the Constitution, allowing for ratification. The Constitution was declared ratified on June 21, 1788, when nine of the original thirteen states had ratified it. The remaining four states later followed suit, although the last two states, North Carolina and Rhode Island, ratified only after Congress had passed the Bill of Rights and sent it to the states for ratification. James Madison drafted what ultimately became the Bill of Rights, which was proposed by the first Congress on June 8, 1789, and was adopted on December 15, 1791.|$|E

Although Banc One could obtain failed banks at a discount that were subsidized by <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>government,</b> they <b>could</b> also be stuck with loans in which borrowers could later default on if the economic crises worsens.|$|R

The refinery would refine bitumen into eight different products. There were no plans for bitumen from the proposed Northern Gateway pipeline to be refined before shipping. This was a separate project, which has been rejected by NB <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government.</b> Black <b>could</b> have refined bitumen from Northern Gateway, {{but there was no}} deal between Black and Enbridge, the proposed pipeline's developer.

500|$|After {{reviewing}} the facts, Andrews began {{by arguing that}} there were many ways to extinguish aboriginal title. He said: [...] "It is material to observe that there was no uniform procedure {{on the part of the}} purchasers from Massachusetts in acquiring the Indian title," [...] and gave examples of conveyances he believed to have been implicitly ratified by the federal government. As to the Seneca argument that, after the ratification of the Constitution, only <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> extinguish aboriginal title, Andrews noted that: ...|$|E

Fourth, the Court {{rejected the}} statute limiting the time in which the government could challenge the validity of its land patents, holding that did not apply to suits on behalf of Indians. Fifth, the Court rejected estoppel: [...] "Since these Indians with the implied consent of the government had acquired such rights of occupancy as entitled them to retain possession as against the defendants, no officer or agent of the government had authority to deal with the land upon any other theory." [...] Finally, however, the Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's voiding of the entire patents, holding that only the portions possessed by the Indians should be void.|$|E
500|$|On October 3, 2013, Harper {{announced}} {{the nomination of}} supernumerary Federal Court of Appeals Marc Nadon {{to the supreme court}} to replace the retiring Morris Fish. The appointment was challenged by both Ontario lawyer Rocco Galati and the provincial government of Quebec as being contrary to the appointment criteria of section 6 of the Supreme Court Act. In response, Harper referred the criteria issue to the supreme court, as well as {{the question of whether the}} government's amendments to the criteria were constitutional. [...] The supreme court subsequently ruled in Reference re Supreme Court Act, ss. 5 and 6 that the Nadon appointment was invalid, and that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> not unilaterally amend the Supreme Court Act. [...] Harper subsequently nominated Clement Gascon to the position instead.|$|E

50|$|A {{component}} of President Lincoln's preliminary {{plans for the}} postwar reconstruction of the South, this proclamation decreed that a state in rebellion against <b>the</b> U.S. <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> be reintegrated into the Union when 10% of the 1860 vote count from that state had taken an oath of allegiance to the U.S. and pledged to abide by Emancipation. Voters could then elect delegates to draft revised state constitutions and establish new state governments. All southerners except for high-ranking Confederate army officers and government officials would be granted a full pardon. Lincoln guaranteed southerners that he would protect their private property, though not their slaves. By 1864, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Arkansas had established fully functioning unionist governments.|$|R

Legislators also approved construction of a canal around the Cumberland Falls and improvements along the Tradewater River.|$|R
500|$|Crow Dog had a {{tremendous}} impact on tribal sovereignty. [...] The decision recognized two distinct concepts in addition to those related to criminal law. First, Justice Matthews had noted that under Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, (1831) the Brulé tribe had a right to its own law in Indian country. Part of this ruling was based on American constitutional tradition – at that time, Indians were not U.S. citizens and according to Matthews did not have a [...] "voice in the selection of representatives and the framing of the laws." [...] The case held that Indian tribes retain sovereignty, and is still valid law. For example, United States v. Lara, (2004) cited Crow Dog when holding that both a tribe and <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> prosecute Lara, as they were separate sovereigns. Subsequent cases have supported the concept [...] "that tribal Indians living in Indian country are citizens of the United States first (under the plenary power doctrine), the tribes second, and the states third, and then {{only to the extent that}} Congress chooses." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{an eye to}} {{a presidential}} bid in 1860, Seward tried to appear a statesman who could be trusted by both North and South. Seward did not believe <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> mandate {{emancipation}} but that it would develop by action of the slave states as the nation urbanized and slavery became uneconomical, {{as it had in}} New York. Southerners still believed that he was threatening the forced end of slavery. While campaigning for Republicans in the 1858 midterm elections, Seward gave a speech at Rochester that proved divisive and quotable, alleging that the U.S. had two [...] "antagonistic system [...] are continually coming into closer contact, and collision results.… It is an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces, and it means that the United States must and will, sooner or later, become entirely either a slave-holding nation, or entirely a free-labor nation." [...] White southerners saw the [...] "irrepressible conflict" [...] speech as a declaration of war, and Seward's vehemence ultimately damaged his chances of gaining the presidential nomination.|$|E
500|$|Functioning as the Senate's {{presiding}} officer, Breckinridge's {{participation in}} the chamber's debates was also restricted, but he won respect for presiding [...] "gracefully and impartially." [...] On January 4, 1859, {{he was asked to}} deliver the final address in the Old Senate Chamber; in the speech, he expressed his desire that the Congress find a solution that would preserve the Union. During its half century in the chamber, the Senate had grown from 32 to 64 members. During those years, he observed, the Constitution had [...] "survived peace and war, prosperity and adversity" [...] to protect [...] "the larger personal freedom compatible with public order." [...] Breckinridge expressed hope that eventually [...] "another Senate, in another age, shall bear to a new and larger Chamber, this Constitution vigorous and inviolate, and that the last generation of posterity shall witness the deliberations of the Representatives of American States, still united, prosperous, and free." [...] Breckinridge then led a procession to the new chamber. Breckinridge opposed the idea that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>could</b> coerce action by a state, but maintained that secession, while legal, was not the solution to the country's problems.|$|E
50|$|The series {{brought in}} fairly good {{ratings for the}} CBC and it was {{expected}} the show would be renewed for a second season; however, the show was cancelled after the Canadian Television Fund's budget was cut by <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> and CBC <b>could</b> only afford to keep its more popular shows, like Royal Canadian Air Farce, on the air. Six half-hour episodes plus an hour-long pilot were produced.|$|R

2500|$|The {{passage of}} the tariff brought {{increased}} sectional tensions to the U.S., tensions that were agitated by then Vice President John C.

The exposition espoused the idea of nullification, a doctrine first articulated in the U.S. by Madison and Jefferson that held that states were sovereign entities and held ultimate authority over {{the limits of the}} power of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government,</b> and <b>could</b> thus [...] "nullify" [...] any act of the central government they deemed unconstitutional. While for a time the tensions increased by Calhoun's exposition lay beneath the surface, they burst forth when South Carolina Senator Robert Young Hayne opened the 1830 Webster–Hayne debate.|$|R
