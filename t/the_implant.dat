5|$|Placement {{of dental}} {{implants}} is a surgical procedure and carries the normal risks of surgery including infection, excessive bleeding and necrosis of the flap of tissue around <b>the</b> <b>implant.</b> Nearby anatomic structures, {{such as the}} inferior alveolar nerve, the maxillary sinus and blood vessels, can also be injured when the osteotomy is created or <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> placed. Even when {{the lining of the}} maxillary sinus is perforated by an implant, long term sinusitis is rare. An inability to place <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> in bone to provide stability of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> (referred to as primary stability of <b>the</b> <b>implant)</b> increases the risk of failure to osseointegration.|$|E
5|$|The {{platform}} between <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> and the abutment can be flat (buttress) or conical fit. In conical fit abutments, {{the collar}} of the abutment sits inside <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> which allows a stronger junction between implant and abutment and a better seal against bacteria into <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment collar, a narrowed collar on the abutment is used, referred to as platform switching. The combination of conical fits and platform switching gives marginally better long term periodontal conditions compared to flat-top abutments.|$|E
5|$|Placement of the implant: <b>The</b> <b>implant</b> screw {{is placed}} {{and can be}} self-tapping, {{otherwise}} the prepared site is tapped with an implant analog. It is then screwed into place with a torque controlled wrench at a precise torque {{so as not to}} overload the surrounding bone (overloaded bone can die, a condition called osteonecrosis, which may lead to failure of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> to fully integrate or bond with the jawbone).|$|E
30|$|Of all <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> studied, <b>the</b> average {{initial torque}} of {{insertion}} was 31  Ncm on <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> with NanoTec™ surface and 39  Ncm on <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> with Vellox® surface.|$|R

The hand-held device establishes electromagnetic coupling with a low radiating radio frequency power inductor in <b>the</b> <b>implanted</b> sensor at a predefined separation and the antenna geometry allows for the antenna to power, interrogate and retrieve data from <b>the</b> <b>implanted</b> sensor without strapping the hand-held device to a human body housing <b>the</b> <b>implanted</b> sensor <b>The</b> hand-held device optionally allows for activation of <b>the</b> <b>implanted</b> sensor only during interrogation and data retrieval...|$|R

5|$|The gingiva {{surrounding}} a tooth has a 2–3mm band of bright pink, very strong attached mucosa, then a darker, larger area of unattached mucosa that folds into the cheeks. When replacing a tooth with an implant, {{a band of}} strong, attached gingiva is needed to keep <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> healthy in the long-term. This is especially important with implants because the blood supply is more precarious in the gingiva {{surrounding a}}n implant, and is theoretically more susceptible to injury because of a longer attachment to <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> than on a tooth (a longer biologic width).|$|E
5|$|The {{relevance}} of primary implant stability decreases gradually with regrowth of bone tissue around <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> {{in the first}} weeks after surgery, leading to secondary stability. Secondary stability {{is different from the}} initial stabilization, because it results from the ongoing process of bone regrowth into <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> (osseointegration). When this healing process is complete, the initial mechanical stability becomes biological stability. Primary stability is critical to implantation success until bone regrowth maximizes mechanical and biological support of <b>the</b> <b>implant.</b> Regrowth usually occurs during the 3–4 weeks after implantation. Insufficient primary stability, or high initial implant mobility, can lead to failure.|$|E
5|$|An implant {{is tested}} between 8 and 24 weeks to {{determine}} if it is integrated. There is significant variation in the criteria used to determine implant success, the most commonly cited criteria at <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> level are the absence of pain, mobility, infection, gingival bleeding, radiographic lucency or peri-implant bone loss greater than 1.5mm.|$|E
30|$|In group 2, {{the same}} {{procedures}} were applied as in group 1. However, unlike <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> in group 1, <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> in group 2 were sterilized by autoclave treatment at 121  °C for 30  min. Afterwards, <b>the</b> sterilized <b>implants</b> were {{inserted in the}} contralateral side of the mandible of the same dog from which <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> were retrieved. After a 3 -month osseointegration period, the animals were sacrificed with a high dose of pentobarbital (i.v.).|$|R
40|$|Ti 6 Al 4 V {{was treated}} by oxygen plasma-based ion {{implantation}} at the voltage pulses of - 30 and - 50 kV with a constant fluency of 0. 6 x 10 (17) O/cm(2). After implantation, the annealing in vacuum {{was applied to}} <b>the</b> <b>implanted</b> samples to control phase structure of <b>the</b> <b>implanted</b> layer. <b>The</b> higher voltage implantation forms nano-size rutile in <b>the</b> <b>implanted</b> layer, but <b>the</b> subsequent annealing at 600 degrees C induces {{the resolution of the}} previous ruitile. Although, the lower voltage implantation does not lead to rutile, the annealing can precipitate anatase and rutile in <b>the</b> <b>implanted</b> layer. <b>The</b> higher voltage implantation results in a higher hardness of <b>the</b> <b>implanted</b> layer. <b>The</b> annealing at 500 degrees C leads to an apparent increase in hardness of <b>the</b> <b>implanted</b> layer, but <b>the</b> annealing at 600 degrees C induces a rapid decrease in hardness.

30|$|Assessing {{the results}} after 12  months, five of <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> in <b>the</b> PTG group {{and five of}} <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> in <b>the</b> OFD group had {{progression}} of radiographic defect depth height.|$|R
5|$|However, later {{research}} suggests that the initial stability of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than a certain period of healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 Ncm) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months. The corollary is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk of initial failure.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, for an implant to look esthetic, {{a band of}} full, plump gingiva {{is needed}} {{to fill in the}} space on either side of implant. The most common soft tissue {{complication}} is called a black-triangle, where the papilla (the small triangular piece of tissue between two teeth) shrinks back and leaves a triangular void between <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> and the adjacent teeth. Dentists can only expect 2–4mm of papilla height over the underlying bone. A black triangle can be expected if the distance between where the teeth touch and bone is any greater.|$|E
5|$|For an implant {{to become}} {{permanently}} stable, the body must grow bone {{to the surface}} of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> (osseointegration). Based on this biologic process, it was thought that loading an implant during the osseointegration period would result in movement that would prevent osseointegration, and thus increase implant failure rates. As a result, three to six months of integrating time (depending on various factors) was allowed before placing the teeth on implants (restoring them).|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} studies of brain transplantation, the fate of <b>the</b> <b>implanted</b> glial cells has been investigated separately; that is, the interest has been focused either on the astroglia or on the oligodendroglia. However, the two populations of implanted glial cells may interact with each other, for example by secreting species-specific factors or by inducing reactions by the host. We have used two different models of brain transplantation: one that allows the identification of <b>the</b> <b>implanted</b> astrocytes, and another that allows the identification of <b>the</b> <b>implanted</b> oligodendroglia. <b>The</b> present model {{is a combination of}} both; it consists of the grafting of embryonic rabbit brain fragments into the brains of neonatal Shiverer mice.

40|$|The {{electrical}} properties of room-temperature Si implants in GaAs have been studied. The implantations were done at 300 keV with doses ranging from 1. 7 × 10 ^ 13 to 1. 7 × 10 ^ 15 cm^– 2. <b>The</b> <b>implanted</b> samples were annealed with silicon nitride encapsulants in H 2 atmosphere for 30 min at temperatures ranging from 800 to 900 °C to electrically activate <b>the</b> <b>implanted</b> ions. Results show that <b>the</b> <b>implanted</b> layers are n type, which {{implies that the}} Si ions preferentially go into Ga sites substitutionally. For low-dose implants, high (~ 90 %) electrical activation of <b>the</b> <b>implanted</b> ions is achieved and the depth distribution of the free-electron concentration in <b>the</b> <b>implanted</b> layer roughly follows a Gaussian. However, for high-dose <b>implants,</b> <b>the</b> activation is poor (< 15 % for a 900 °C anneal) and the electron concentration profile is flat and deeper than the expected range...|$|R
5|$|Integration {{failure is}} rare, {{particularly}} if a dentist's or oral surgeon's instructions are {{followed closely by}} the patient. Immediate loading implants may have {{a higher rate of}} failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, but the difference with proper care and maintenance is well within statistical variance for this type of procedure. More often, osseointegration failure occurs when a patient is either too unhealthy to receive <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including smoking or drug use.|$|E

5|$|Soft tissue reflection: An {{incision}} is {{made over}} the crest of bone, splitting the thicker attached gingiva roughly in half so that the final implant will have a thick band of tissue around it.

30|$|The {{patients}} evaluated only showed normal {{signs and}} symptoms of post-operatory swelling. According to the distribution of <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> on <b>the</b> mandibular region, 2 cases of <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> with NanoTec™ surface were placed on the canine region, 9 on the premolar region, and 9 on the molar region.

50|$|After {{being placed}} in a {{surgical}} procedure, dental implants undergo osseointegration, during which time the surrounding bone grows into intimate contact with the surface of <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> and <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> become fused to the bone. When this process has been deemed to have occurred to a sufficient extent, <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> are fitted with restorative abutments {{in order to allow}} dental restorations (e.g. crowns, dentures, etc.) to be cemented on, screwed down or otherwise attached.|$|R
5|$|The {{design of}} {{implants}} has {{to account for}} a lifetime of real-world use in a person's mouth. Regulators and the dental implant industry have created a series of tests to determine the long-term mechanical reliability of implants in a person's mouth where <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> is struck repeatedly with increasing forces (similar in magnitude to biting) until it fails.|$|E
5|$|The final {{prosthetic}} can {{be either}} fixed, where a person cannot remove the denture or teeth from their mouth, or removable, where they can remove the prosthetic. In each case an abutment is attached to <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> fixture. Where the prosthetic is fixed, the crown, bridge or denture is fixed to the abutment either with lag screws or with dental cement. Where the prosthetic is removable, a corresponding adapter {{is placed in the}} prosthetic so that the two pieces can be secured together.|$|E
5|$|To {{achieve an}} {{adequate}} width and height of bone, various bone grafting techniques have been developed. The {{most frequently used}} is called guided bone graft augmentation where a defect is filled with either natural (harvested or autograft) bone or allograft (donor bone or synthetic bone substitute), covered with a semi-permeable membrane and allowed to heal. During the healing phase, natural bone replaces the graft forming a new bony base for <b>the</b> <b>implant.</b>|$|E

Mulder shows Scully more photos of the victims and, having found more implants in them, believes <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> in Scully {{may be able to}} answer all of their questions. The Syndicate meets over the capture of the Rebel. The Well-Manicured Man informs them of the existence of the Russian vaccine, believing that this makes resistance to the Colonists possible. If the vaccine is ineffective he proposes avoiding handing over the Rebel and instead forming an alliance with the Rebels, but the other Syndicate members believe this would be a suicidal course of action.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, stock {{abutments}} {{are used}} to retain dentures using a male-adapter attached to <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> and a female adapter in the denture. Two common types of adapters are the ball-and-socket style retainer and the button-style adapter. These types of stock abutments allow movement of the denture, but enough retention {{to improve the quality}} of life for denture wearers, compared to conventional dentures. Regardless of the type of adapter, the female portion of the adapter that is housed in the denture will require periodic replacement, however the number and adapter type does not seem to affect patient satisfaction with the prosthetic for various removable alternatives.|$|E
