40|$|Part 2 : WorkshopInternational audienceBoth dynamic binary {{translation}} {{systems and}} optimization systems store the translated or optimized code {{in the software}} maintained code cache for reuse. The performance of the code cache is crucial. Translated code is usually organized as code blocks in the code cache and each code block transfer control {{to the next one}} through a control transfer instruction. As the target address of a control transfer instruction {{is in the form of}} its source program counter, the conventional code cache system has to check the address mapping table for the translated target address to find the required target code block, which will cause considerable performance degradation. Control <b>transfer</b> <b>instructions</b> can be divided into two categories as direct control <b>transfer</b> <b>instructions</b> and indirect control <b>transfer</b> <b>instructions.</b> For indirect control <b>transfer</b> <b>instructions,</b> the target address is hold in the register or memory element whose content can be changed during the execution of the program. It is difficult to chain the indirect control <b>transfer</b> <b>instructions</b> with a fixed translated target address through pure software approaches. A novel indirect control transfer chaining approach is proposed in this paper. The principle of the technique is to insert custom chaining instructions into the translated code block while translating the indirect control <b>transfer</b> <b>instructions</b> and execute those chaining instructions to implement dynamical chaining. Some special hardware and software assists are proposed in this paper. Evaluation of the proposed approach is conducted on a code cache simulator. Experiment results show that our hardware assisted indirect control transfer instruction chaining approach can improve the performance of the code cache system dramatically...|$|E

We have continued working on our new concept, topological testing, and demonstrated several applications in the area of multiprocessor testing. Topological testing uses graph theoretic optimization methods, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem, the Chinese Postman Problem, coloring, path covering and partitioning to minimize the test time. The topological testing techniques can be applied to test a system's behavior and its organization at each level of the system's hierarchy; namely, circuit, logic, register <b>transfer,</b> <b>instruction</b> and processor-memory-switch levels. Specifically, the topological testing approach was demonstrated by developing tests for the multistage interconnection network and the hypercube network.

30|$|Two-step marker {{injection}} Injecting markers into program {{binary code}} may alter {{the address of}} program text, and it skews the target address of control <b>transfer</b> <b>instructions.</b> Thus, binary rewriting requires a painful job to update all the address of control <b>transfer</b> <b>instructions</b> even in the position-independent code (PIC). This {{is the reason why}} binary rewriting on a code is being used in limited ways. In order to avoid the problem, we first inject empty slots to a source code to prepare space for the semantics markers and compile the source code. At the binary code, the slots will then occupy spaces for markers. We fill the slots by computing semantics markers for that position. Since space for markers already exists at compile time, no address of the program code needs to be changed; thus, no additional binary rewriting is required.|$|E
