5000|$|<b>Twist-on</b> wire {{connectors}} are not generally recommended {{for use with}} aluminum wire. [...] The US Consumer Product Safety Commission does not approve of their use with aluminum wire, and approves of only two (alternative) methods of connection. [...] In spite of this, several companies manufacture <b>twist-on</b> connectors which they claim are designed specifically for, and rated for, use with aluminum conductors.|$|E
50|$|A {{connector}} {{more closely}} resembling the present-day <b>twist-on</b> type was not patented in Canada by Marr until 1931, {{and in the}} US until 1933.|$|E
50|$|It is {{most often}} used to prevent rust, but is also {{commonly}} applied {{to the ends of}} stranded wire used as electrical conductors to prevent oxidation (which increases electrical resistance), and to keep them from fraying or unraveling when used in various wire connectors like <b>twist-ons,</b> binding posts, or terminal blocks, where stray strands can cause a short circuit.|$|R
50|$|Ordinary <b>twist-on</b> {{connectors}} are {{not rated}} for wet use (such as exposed outdoors or buried underground). Special gel-filled connectors {{must be used}} in this circumstance.|$|E
50|$|This table {{shows the}} de facto {{standard}} color coding various manufacturers use to indicate the range of sizes of conductors that may be joined with <b>twist-on</b> wire connectors.|$|E
5000|$|Special <b>twist-on</b> {{connectors}} (or [...] "wire nuts") {{are available}} for joining aluminum to copper wire, which are pre-filled with a special antioxidant compound in a low-residue polybutene base with a zinc dust added to the compound, intended to abrade the wires and prevent corrosion of the connection. As of 2014 {{there was only one}} <b>twist-on</b> connector rated or [...] "UL Listed" [...] for connecting aluminum and copper branch circuit wires in the U.S., which is the Ideal No. 65 [...] "Twister Al/Cu wire connector". These special <b>twist-on</b> connectors have a distinctive purple color, have been UL Listed for aluminum to copper branch circuit wire connections since 1995, and according to the manufacturer's current literature are [...] "perfect for pig-tailing a copper conductor onto aluminum branch circuit wiring in retrofit applications". The CPSC still considers the use of <b>twist-on</b> connectors, including the Ideal No. 65 [...] "Twister Al/Cu wire connector", to be a temporary repair. According to the CPSC, even using (listed) <b>twist-on</b> connectors to attach copper pigtails to older aluminum wires as a temporary repair requires special installation procedures, including abrading and pre-twisting the wires. However, the manufacturer's instructions for the Ideal No. 65 Twister only recommends pre-twisting the wires, and does not state it's required. Also the instructions do not mention physically abrading the wires as recommended by the CPSC, although the manufacturer current literature states the pre-filled [...] "compound cuts aluminum oxide". Some researchers have criticized the UL listing/tests for this wire connector, and there have been reported problems with tests (without pre-twisting) and installations. However, it is unknown if the reported installation problems were associated with unqualified persons attempting these repairs, or not using recommended special installation procedures (such as abrading and pre-twisting the wires as recommended by the CPSC for older aluminum wire, or at least pre-twisting the wires as recommended by Ideal for their connectors).|$|E
50|$|<b>Twist-on</b> {{connectors}} {{are also}} known as wire nuts, wire connectors, cone connectors, or thimble connectors. One trade name for such connectors, Marrette, {{is derived from the}} name of their inventor (see History).|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Two light {{switches}} and wiring, as {{installed in the}} United States. Switches are fastened in a non-metallic box, then a cover plate is installed. This installation uses non-metallic-sheathed cable and <b>twist-on</b> wire connectors.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Twist-on</b> wire {{connectors}} are {{a type of}} electrical connector used to fasten two or more low-voltage (or extra-low-voltage) electrical conductors. They are widely used in North America in residential, commercial and industrial building power wiring.|$|E
50|$|A common {{application}} of the lineman's pliers in gripping and twisting wires together, preparatory to installing a <b>twist-on</b> wire connector. Pliers may also be used in pulling a fish-tape, to crimp metals, and to pull nails and other fasteners.|$|E
50|$|<b>Twist-on</b> {{connectors}} are {{not often}} used on wire gauges thicker than AWG #10 (5.26 mm²), because such solid wires are too stiff to be reliably connected with this method. Instead, set screw connectors, clamps or crimp connectors are used.|$|E
5000|$|In North American {{building}} wiring, <b>twist-on</b> {{wire connectors}} are frequently used in low-voltage power circuits for wires {{up to about}} #10 AWG in size. These allow wire connections in electrical boxes that are more quickly installed than the obsolete practice of soldering and taping wires.|$|E
50|$|<b>Twist-on</b> wire {{connectors}} are commonly color-coded {{to indicate the}} connector size and, hence, their capacity. They are commonly used {{as an alternative to}} terminal blocks or the soldering of conductors together, since they are quicker to install and, unlike soldered connections, allow easy subsequent removal for future modifications.|$|E
50|$|The {{process was}} {{time-consuming}} and potentially dangerous. Marr was injured when he spilled molten solder on himself. Seeking a safer, more efficient connection method, Marr, {{working in his}} home workshop, developed the first pressure-type wire connector. In 1914, he produced a set-screw version, the forerunner of the present-day <b>twist-on</b> connector used throughout North America.|$|E
5000|$|... "Pig-tailing" [...] which {{involves}} splicing a short length of copper wire (pigtail) {{to the original}} aluminum wire, and then attaching the copper wire to the existing electrical device. The splice of the copper pigtail to the existing aluminum wire can be accomplished with special crimp connectors, special miniature lug-type connectors, or approved <b>twist-on</b> connectors (with special installation procedures).|$|E
50|$|<b>Twist-on</b> wire {{connectors}} are typically installed by hand. They may have external grooves {{to make them}} easier to handle and apply. Winglike extensions are commonly molded into higher quality connectors to reduce operator muscle fatigue when installing {{a large number of}} the connectors. Such extensions also allow these connectors to be installed with a common nut driver or a specialized tool.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>twist-on</b> {{design has}} slots {{on the lid}} {{engaging}} with flanges on the body, similar to a lid on a glass jar, that works by placing the lid on the pot and twisting it about 30° to lock it in place. A common modern design, it has easily implemented locking features that prevent {{the removal of the}} lid while under pressure.|$|E
50|$|Each pen needle is {{embedded}} in a plastic hub that can attach to the pen {{by means of a}} <b>twist-on</b> fitting or a click-on. Two protective caps (outer and inner caps) protect the user and the needle. The peel foil protects the sterility of the needle and holds information such as lot number, and needle length and gauge. Pen needles vary by needle length and diameter(gauge).|$|E
5000|$|Special {{feedthrough}} <b>twist-on</b> {{wire connectors}} differ from standard wire connectors {{in that they}} have an additional opening {{at the top of the}} insulated cap. This allows a single-conductor bare wire to be pushed through the hole, forming a [...] "pigtail" [...] section which can be attached to a grounding screw. These feedthrough connectors are typically green, and are also called [...] "screw-on grounding connectors".|$|E
5000|$|Knob Creek {{comes in}} a {{rectangular}} bottle with a corked or <b>twist-on</b> cap and wax-sealed top. The bourbon has a dark, golden-brown color.According to the company, {{this is due to}} the relatively long aging process, which allows it to absorb more sugar from the wood than is the case for the other Jim Beam Small Batch brands. The company describes the flavor as [...] "rich, sweet, woody, full-bodied, almost fruity", and the aroma as [...] "toasted nuts, grain, oak".|$|E
50|$|This {{common and}} simple splice {{is not very}} strong mechanically. It can be made {{stronger}} by coating it with solder, {{or it can be}} twisted and then held in place by the internal metal spring or threads of a <b>twist-on</b> wire connector, also called a wire nut. Because it is not very strong, the splice is not meant to connect wires that will be pulled or stressed. Rather, it is intended for wires that are protected inside an enclosure or junction box.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Twist-on</b> wire {{connectors}} {{are available in}} a variety of sizes and shapes. While their exterior covering is typically made from insulating plastic, their means of connection is a tapered coiled metal insert, which threads onto the wires and holds them securely. When such a connector is twisted onto the stripped and twisted-together ends of wires, the wires are drawn into the connector's metal insert and squeezed together inside it. Electrical continuity is maintained by both the direct twisted wire-to-wire contact and by contact with the metal insert.|$|E
50|$|Another {{specialized}} connector {{version has}} a permanently attached wire pigtail {{protruding from the}} top of the insulated cap. The pigtail may be unterminated, or it may end in a preinstalled spade lug. If colored white, it typically may be used for splicing neutral wires in a device box, while leaving a pigtail free for connection to a device (such as a receptacle). If colored green, the assembly is intended to be used as a grounding pigtail, similar to the feedthrough <b>twist-on</b> wire connectors described in the previous paragraph.|$|E
50|$|Usually, {{computerized}} sets {{cannot be}} connected end-to-end. However, some newer sets contain special miniature plugs - a female jack {{is located at}} the end of the set, and a male plug is located between the control box and the beginning of the actual lights. By disconnecting the control box from one set, it can now be plugged into the end of an identical chasing set to produce a longer strand of chasing lights. These plugs generally have a <b>twist-on</b> locking feature similar to that found on garden hoses.|$|E
5000|$|In 1972, the 429CJ & SCJ's {{were dropped}} from the lineup, and {{horsepower}} dropped across the board due to the switch to new SAE net horsepower calculations. The following year also produced the fewest Mach 1 sales of the 1971-73 generation. There are no major differences in the '71 and '72 Mustangs externally, other than {{the addition of a}} [...] "Mustang" [...] script {{on the right side of}} the trunk panel (excluding Mach 1). The '72 Mach 1 also saw deletion of the pop-open gas cap, which was replaced with the standard <b>twist-on</b> cap found on the other Mustang models that year. The 302 Windsor remained as the base Mach 1 engine, with the 2 or 4 barrel 351 Clevelands as the only options.|$|E
5000|$|The {{diameter}} of the needle is indicated by the needle gauge. Various needle lengths are available for any given gauge. There {{are a number of}} systems for gauging needles, including the Stubs Needle Gauge and the French Catheter Scale. Needles in common medical use range from 7 gauge (the largest) to 33 (the smallest) on the Stubs scale. 21-gauge needles are most commonly used for drawing blood for testing purposes, and 16- or 17-gauge needles are most commonly used for blood donation, as the resulting lower pressure is less harmful to red blood cells (it also allows more blood to be collected in a shorter time). Although reusable needles remain useful for some scientific applications, disposable needles are far more common in medicine. Disposable needles are embedded in a plastic or aluminium hub that attaches to the syringe barrel by means of a press-fit or <b>twist-on</b> fitting. These are sometimes referred to as [...] "Luer Lock" [...] connections, referring to the trademark Luer-Lok.|$|E
50|$|Contrary {{to popular}} misconception, {{wobbling}} will not cause a ceiling fan to fall. Ceiling fans are secured by clevis pins locked with either split pins or R-clips, so wobbling won't {{have an effect}} on the fan's security, unless of course, the pins/clips were not secured. To date, there are no reports of a fan wobbling itself off the ceiling and falling. However, a severe wobble can cause light fixture shades or covers to gradually loosen over time and potentially fall, posing a risk of injury to anyone under the fan, and also from any resulting broken glass. It is also worth mentioning that when the MythBusters were designing a fan with the goal of chopping off someone's head, Scottie used an edge finder to find the exact center of their blades with the aim of eliminating potentially very dangerous wobbling of their steel blades. It is important that, when installing the fan, the installer closely follows the manufacturer's instructions with regard to using proper mounting screws. It is also important that all screws (especially the set screws which hold <b>twist-on</b> downrods in place) be tight, and any ceiling fan light fixtures are properly assembled with their shades and covers securely attached.|$|E
