5|$|As Secretary Upshur {{accelerated}} the secret treaty discussions, Mexican diplomats learned that US-Texas talks were taking place. Mexican {{minister to the}} U.S. Juan Almonte confronted Upshur with these reports, warning him that if Congress sanctioned a treaty of annexation, Mexico would break diplomatic ties and immediately declare war. Secretary Upshur evaded and dismissed <b>the</b> <b>charges,</b> <b>and</b> pressed forward with the negotiations. In tandem with moving forward with Texas diplomats, Upshur was secretly lobbying US Senators to support annexation, providing lawmakers with persuasive arguments linking Texas acquisition to national security and domestic peace. By early 1844, Upshur was able to assure Texas officials that 40 of the 52 members of the Senate were pledged to ratify the Tyler-Texas treaty, more than the two-thirds majority required for passage. Tyler, in his annual address to Congress in December 1843, maintained his silence on the secret treaty, {{so as not to}} damage relations with the wary Texas diplomats. Throughout, Tyler did his utmost to keep the negotiations secret, making no public reference to his administration's single-minded quest for Texas.|$|E

5|$|Ions {{typically}} pack into extremely regular crystalline structures, in {{an arrangement}} that minimizes the lattice energy (maximizing attractions and minimizing repulsions). The lattice energy is the summation of the interaction of all sites with all other sites. For unpolarizable spherical ions only <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> distances are required to determine the electrostatic interaction energy. For any particular ideal crystal structure, all distances are geometrically related to the smallest internuclear distance. So for each possible crystal structure, the total electrostatic energy {{can be related to}} the electrostatic energy of unit charges at the nearest neighbour distance by a multiplicative constant called the Madelung constant that can be efficiently computed using an Ewald sum. When a reasonable form is assumed for the additional repulsive energy, the total lattice energy can be modelled using the Born–Landé equation, the Born–Mayer equation, or in the absence of structural information, the Kapustinskii equation.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2008–09 season, on 18 July 2008, Evra was charged with four {{separate}} counts of improper conduct by the FA. The charges were related to an incident that occurred during the 2007–08 season when Evra had an altercation with a Chelsea groundsman during a warm-down following a match on 26 April. The defender denied <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> was supported by several members of the club's staff, who commented that the player was racially abused by the groundsman prior to the confrontation. Evra remained free to play for United up to the date of the hearing despite the charges being made in July 2008. He began the campaign in similar fashion to last season as Manchester United won the Community Shield following the team's 3–0 victory over Portsmouth on penalties. Evra was ever-present in Manchester United's first 22 competitive matches of the season, starting 19 of them. At the hearing on 5 December, Evra was found guilty of improper conduct, and handed a four-match ban – due to start on 22 December 2008 – and a £15,000 fine.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{perturbations}} against a Q-ball solution are considered. It is shown {{that if we}} calculate <b>the</b> U(1) <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> energy of the modes, which are solutions to linearized equations of motion, {{up to the second}} order in perturbations, we will get incorrect results. In particular, for the time-dependent modes we will obtain nonzero terms, which explicitly depend on time, indicating the non-conservation over time of <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> energy. It is shown that, as expected, this problem can be resolved by considering nonlinear equations of motion for the perturbations, providing second-order corrections to the solutions of linearized equations of motion. It turns out that contributions of these corrections to <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> energy can be taken into account without solving explicitly the nonlinear equations of motion for the perturbations. It is also shown that the use of such nonlinear equations not only recovers the conservation over time of <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> energy, but also results in the additivity of <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> energy of different modes forming the perturbation.

In September that year 44 European psychiatrists wrote to The Times (London) expressing grave doubts about the diagnoses of the six people concerned. At a meeting in November 1971, the World Federation for Mental Health called on its members to investigate <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> defend the right to free opinion where it was threatened. These responses were carefully documented by the dissident human rights periodical Chronicle of Current Events, which also recorded the many statements made by Bukovsky's friends and fellow rights activists in his defence.

5|$|By October 1991, Ferraro {{was ready}} to enter {{elective}} politics again, {{and ran for the}} Democratic nomination in the 1992 United States Senate election in New York. Her opponents were State Attorney General Robert Abrams, Reverend Al Sharpton, Congressman Robert J. Mrazek, and New York City Comptroller and former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman. Abrams was considered the early front-runner. The D'Amato campaign feared facing Ferraro the most among these, as her Italian ancestry, effective debating and stump speech skills, and her staunch pro-choice views would eat into several of D'Amato's usual bases of support. Ferraro emphasized her career as a teacher, prosecutor, congresswoman, and mother, and talked about how she was tough on crime. Ferraro drew renewed attacks during the primary campaign from the media and her opponents over Zaccaro's finances and business relationships. She objected that a male candidate would not receive nearly as much attention regarding his wife's activities. Ferraro became the front-runner, capitalizing on her star power from 1984, and using the campaign attacks against her as an explicitly feminist rallying point for women voters. As the primary date neared, her lead began to dwindle under <b>the</b> <b>charges,</b> <b>and</b> she released additional tax returns from the 1980s to try to defray the attacks.|$|E

Mitchell pleaded guilty on March 8, 2013, to one count of conspiring to file a false tax claim with the federal government. At a hearing on October 24, 2013, in Orlando, Florida, he claimed that his crime stemmed from concussions he suffered during his career in the NFL, adding that he suffers from headaches, insomnia, and memory loss. That memory loss was cited as a possible reason for his failing to pay child support in that case as well. His attorneys asked the judge in the case that Mitchell only be sentenced to community service and probation. On October 29, he was sentenced to serve 37 months in prison. He began his sentence on December 6.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Marshall {{departed}} for Philadelphia, the temporary national capital, George Muter and Benjamin Sebastian, both justices of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, published a pamphlet stating that Marshall had perjured {{himself in a}} Court of Appeals case between himself and James Wilkinson.

Marshall, being out of the state, was unable to reply immediately to <b>the</b> <b>charges,</b> <b>and</b> his enemies in the General Assembly drafted a memorial to the U.S. Senate requesting an investigation of the charges. On December 16, 1795, the memorial was approved by the General Assembly and transmitted to the Senate. The Senate appointed a committee to recommend action on the memorial, and the committee found that the charges against Marshall were not specific, that the authors had provided no evidence upon which to evaluate the charges, that no one was empowered to prosecute the charges in the Senate, and that further action by the Senate was inappropriate. On March 22, 1796, the Senate approved the committee's report by a vote of 168. Muter and Sebastian never filed formal charges against Marshall for perjury.|$|E
5|$|Re Lim Chor Pee, {{ex parte}} Law Society of Singapore (1985) {{is another example}} of a case where a {{mandatory}} order was granted by the High Court. The appellant, Lim Chor Pee, who was an advocate and solicitor, had been convicted of several income tax offences and had been found to have tampered with a witness. On 16 July 1982, the Attorney-General wrote to the President of the Law Society of Singapore, providing information on the appellant's conviction and other records. Following a report by the Society's Inquiry Committee that a formal inquiry into the appellant's conduct was necessary, a Disciplinary Committee was appointed. The appellant successfully applied to the Disciplinary Committee to delete certain paragraphs of the statement of case which had been formulated against him by the Council of the Law Society, on the ground that the facts in those paragraphs did not appear in the Inquiry Committee's report. Consequently, three of the six charges against the appellant and a major portion of one other charge did not require investigation by the Disciplinary Committee. Dissatisfied with this decision, the Law Society applied to the High Court for an order of mandamus to direct the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate all the six charges against the appellant. The High Court granted the application, holding that under the Legal Profession Act, the Inquiry Committee's only function was to consider the matters before it and decide whether or not there should be a formal investigation by a Disciplinary Committee. It was the duty of the Council of the Law Society to draw up <b>the</b> <b>charges,</b> <b>and</b> the duty of the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate the charges properly before the Committee in the statement of case. Thus, the appellant could not object that some of the charges against him were based on facts not mentioned in the Inquiry Committee's report. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.|$|E

5|$|The {{criminal}} trial continued {{for most of}} the summer and Carrouges, Le Gris and Marguerite were all called on to give evidence. Marguerite was by this time visibly pregnant, although medieval medical knowledge claimed that children could not be conceived as a result of rape and her condition therefore was determined to have no bearing on the case. Adam Louvel and at least one of Marguerite's maidservants also gave evidence and, as was the custom of the day for people of low birth, they were tortured to test the veracity of their testimony. During this process neither produced evidence incriminating Le Gris, although Louvel was subsequently challenged to a duel himself by Marguerite's cousin, Thomin du Bois. In his evidence, Carrouges statement primarily repeated and supported his wife's testimony, while Le Gris accused Carrouges of inventing <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> beating his wife into making the accusations against the squire. In his statement, Le Gris painted a picture of a man driven wild with anger and jealousy who sought to restore his family fortune by concocting false accusations against his most significant rival. Le Gris also offered alibis for his whereabouts during the entire week the crime {{was supposed to have been}} committed and attempted to explain that it was not possible for him to have ridden the twenty-five miles which supposedly separated him from Marguerite on the morning in question. A rebuttal from Carrouges emphasised the shame the trial had brought to his family as a reason against its invention and offered a counter demonstration of horsemanship indicating that the suggested fifty mile round trip was not impossible even if Le Gris's alibi was true. Le Gris' alibi was compromised some days later when the man providing it, a squire named Jean Beloteau, was arrested for committing rape in Paris even as the trial progressed. On 15 September, with the King in Flanders preparing for an invasion of England, the parlement handed down its verdict: As they had been unable to determine the guilt in the case, the two men would fight a duel to the death on 27 November 1386.|$|E
