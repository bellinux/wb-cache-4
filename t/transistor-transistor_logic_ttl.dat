5|$|The Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) was a joint US/NATO {{development}} program. RSIP {{enhances the}} operational {{capability of the}} E-3 radars' electronic countermeasures, and dramatically improve the system's reliability, maintainability, and availability. Essentially, this program replaced the older <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (<b>TTL)</b> and emitter-coupled logic (MECL) electronic components, long-since out of production, with off-the-shelf digital computers that utilised a High-level programming language instead of assembly language. Significant improvement came from adding pulse compression to the pulse-Doppler mode, replacing the old 8-bit FFT with 24-bit FFTs, and the 12-bit A/D (Sign + 12-bits) with a 15-bit A/D (Sign + 15-bits). These hardware and software modifications improve the E-3 radars' performance, providing enhanced detection with an emphasis towards low radar cross-section (RCS) targets.|$|E
25|$|The above logic ICs {{were built}} from {{standard}} components, with sizes and configurations {{defined by the}} technological process, and all the diodes and transistors on one IC were of the same type. The use of different transistor types was first proposed by Tom Long at Sylvania in 1961–1962. In late 1962, Sylvania launched the first family of <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (<b>TTL)</b> ICs, which became a commercial success. Bob Widlar from Fairchild made a similar breakthrough in 1964–1965 in analog ICs (operational amplifiers).|$|E
2500|$|Phase {{noise is}} {{another type of}} jitter {{observed}} in PLLs, and {{is caused by the}} oscillator itself and by elements used in the oscillator's frequency control circuit. [...] Some technologies are known to perform better than others in this regard. [...] The best digital PLLs are constructed with emitter-coupled logic (ECL) elements, at the expense of high power consumption. To keep phase noise low in PLL circuits, it is best to avoid saturating logic families such as <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (<b>TTL)</b> or CMOS.|$|E
5000|$|... 7400 series {{parts were}} {{constructed}} using bipolar transistors, forming what {{is referred to}} as <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> or <b>TTL.</b> Newer series, more or less compatible in function and logic level with the original parts, use CMOS technology or {{a combination of the two}} (BiCMOS). Originally the bipolar circuits provided higher speed but consumed more power than the competing 4000 series of CMOS devices. Bipolar devices are also limited to a fixed power supply voltage, typically 5 V, while CMOS parts often support a range of supply voltages.|$|R
50|$|The first {{implementation}} was the TS1, {{a central}} processing unit built from discrete <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (74F <b>TTL)</b> devices. Later implementations were multi-chip VLSI designs fabricated in NMOS processes (NS1 and NS2) and CMOS (CS1 and PCX).They were first used in {{a new series of}} HP 3000 machines in the late 1980s - the 930 and 950, commonly known at the time as Spectrum systems, the name given to them in the development labs. These machines ran MPE-XL. The HP 9000 machines were soon upgraded with the PA-RISC processor as well, running the HP-UX version of UNIX.|$|R
5000|$|Differential TTL {{is a type}} of binary {{electrical}} signaling {{based on}} the <b>TTL</b> (<b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic)</b> standard. Normal <b>TTL</b> signals are single-ended, which means that each signal consists of a voltage on one wire, referenced to a system ground. The [...] "low" [...] voltage level is zero to 0.8 volts, and the [...] "high" [...] voltage level is 2 volts to 5 volts. A differential TTL signal consists of two such wires, also referenced to a system ground. The logic level on one wire is always the complement of the other. The principle {{is similar to that of}} low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS), but with different voltage levels, and even more similar to the RS-422 standard.|$|R
2500|$|In 1986, Commodore {{released}} the last revision {{to the classic}} C64 motherboard. It was otherwise identical to the 1984 design, except for the two 64 kilobit × 4 bit DRAM chips that replaced the original eight 64 kilobit × 1 bit ICs. After {{the release of the}} Commodore 64C, MOS Technology began to reconfigure the original C64's chipset to use HMOS production technology. The main benefit of using HMOS was that it required less voltage to drive the IC, which consequently generates less heat. This enhanced the overall reliability of the SID and VIC-II. The new chipset was renumbered to 85xx to reflect the change to HMOS. In 1987, Commodore released a 64C variant with a highly redesigned motherboard commonly known as a [...] "short board". The new board used the new HMOS chipset, featuring a new 64-pin PLA chip. The new [...] "SuperPLA", as it was dubbed, integrated many discrete components and <b>transistor–transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (<b>TTL)</b> chips. In the last revision of the 64C motherboard, the 2114 color RAM was integrated into the SuperPLA.|$|E
5000|$|The IBM 5151 was a 12" [...] <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (<b>TTL)</b> {{monochrome}} monitor, shipped {{with the}} original IBM Personal Computer.|$|E
50|$|The 7400 {{series of}} <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (<b>TTL)</b> chips, {{developed}} by Texas Instruments in the 1960s, popularized {{the use of}} integrated circuits in computer logic. The military grade version of this was the 5400 series.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} logic {{families}} with different characteristics (power consumption, speed, cost, size) such as: RDL (resistor-diode logic), RTL (resistor-transistor logic), DTL (diode-transistor <b>logic),</b> <b>TTL</b> (<b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic)</b> and CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor). There are also sub-variants, e.g. standard CMOS logic vs. advanced types using still CMOS technology, {{but with some}} optimizations for avoiding loss of speed due to slower PMOS transistors.|$|R

50|$|AOI gates are {{similarly}} efficient in <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (<b>TTL).</b> The TTL 7400 line included {{a number of}} AOI gate parts, such as the 7451 dual 2-wide 2-input AND-OR-invert gate and the 7464 4-2-3-2-input AND-OR-invert gate.|$|E
50|$|The {{first of}} these {{machines}} was the Dolphin, built with <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (<b>TTL)</b> technology. The complexity of the software eventually overwhelmed its limited configuration. At one time in Star's development, {{it took more than}} half an hour to reboot the system.|$|E
50|$|<b>Transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (<b>TTL)</b> is a {{class of}} digital {{circuits}} built from bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) and resistors. It is called transistor-transistor logic because transistors perform both the logic function (e.g., AND) and the amplifying function (compare with resistor-transistor logic (RTL) and diode-transistor logic (DTL)).|$|E

50|$|A similar <b>logic</b> family, direct-coupled <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic,</b> {{is faster}} than ECL.|$|R
50|$|<b>Transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (<b>TTL)</b> {{was a great}} {{improvement}} over these. In early devices, fanout improved to 10, and later variations reliably achieved 20. TTL was also fast, with some variations achieving switching times as low as 20 ns. TTL is still used in some designs.|$|E
50|$|The {{memory system}} {{consists}} of three major parts, a memory controller, a <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (<b>TTL)</b> bus and one to eight memory array modules. The memory controller is implemented with ECL gate arrays and resides on an NMI bus module. It implements a TTL bus to which memory array modules are connected. Two memory modules were available for the VAX 8800: a 4 MB module and a 16 MB module. The 4 MB array module is an eight-layer printed circuit board populated by metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) {{dynamic random access memory}} (DRAM) devices and medium-scale integration (MSI) FAST <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (<b>TTL)</b> devices in roughly equal numbers. The 16 MB array module is similar to the 4 MB module, but contains eight surface-mounted daughter boards, each containing 2 MB of memory built from DRAMs.|$|E
50|$|The 7400 {{series of}} <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (<b>TTL)</b> {{integrated}} circuits {{are the most}} popular family of TTL integrated circuit logic. Quickly replacing diode-transistor logic, it was used to build the mini and mainframe computers of the 1960s and 1970s. Several generations of pin-compatible descendants of the original family have since become de facto standard electronic components.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> {{family of}} {{integrated}} circuits {{was introduced by}} Sylvania as Sylvania Universal High-Level Logic (SUHL) in 1963. Texas Instruments introduced the 7400 Series TTL family in 1964. <b>Transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> uses bipolar transistors to form its integrated circuits. TTL has changed significantly over the years, with newer versions replacing the older types.|$|R

50|$|Furthermore, Fairchild's DTL {{technology}} was being overtaken by Texas Instruments's faster <b>TTL</b> (<b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic).</b>|$|R
50|$|Later systems (the PDP-8/I and /L, the PDP-8/E, /F, and /M, and the PDP-8/A) {{returned}} to a faster, fully parallel implementation but use much less costly <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (<b>TTL)</b> MSI logic. Most surviving PDP-8s are from this era. The PDP-8/E is common, and well-regarded because so many types of I/O devices were available for it. It was often configured as a general-purpose computer.|$|E
5000|$|The VAX-11/780, code-named [...] "Star", was {{introduced}} on 25 October 1977 at DEC's Annual Meeting of Shareholders. It {{is the first}} computer to implement the VAX architecture. The VAX-11/780 central processing unit (CPU) is built from <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (<b>TTL)</b> devices and has a 200 ns cycle time (5 MHz) and a 2 kB cache. Memory and I/O are accessed via the Synchronous Backplane Interconnect (SBI).|$|E
5000|$|Third {{generation}} computers use Integrated Circuits, {{the main}} difference between hardware in computers of the 1960s and today being the density of transistors in each IC (beginning with Small Scale Integration chips like the <b>Transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (<b>TTL)</b> SN7400 gates with 20 transistors, through Medium Scale Integration and Large Scale Integration to Very-large-scale integration (VLSI) with over ten billion transistors in a single IC [...] "chip".|$|E
5000|$|Common fixed {{voltages}} are 1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3.3 V (both for low-voltage CMOS logic circuits), 5 V (for <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> circuits) and 12 V (for communications circuits and peripheral {{devices such}} as disk drives).|$|R
5000|$|HCT {{stands for}} {{high-speed}} CMOS with <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> voltages. These devices {{are similar to}} the HCMOS types except they will operate at standard TTL power supply voltages and logic input levels. This allows for direct pin-to-pin compatible CMOS replacements to reduce power consumption without loss of speed.|$|R
50|$|Diode-transistor logic (DTL) is a {{class of}} digital {{circuits}} that is the direct ancestor of <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic.</b> It is called so because the logic gating function (e.g., AND) is performed by a diode network and the amplifying function is performed by a transistor (in contrast with RTL and TTL).|$|R
50|$|IBM {{referred}} to PALM as a microprocessor, though they used that term {{to mean a}} processor that executes microcode to implement a higher-level instruction set, rather than its conventional definition of a complete processor on a single silicon integrated circuit. The PALM processor was an entire circuit board containing 13 square metal-can bipolar gate arrays, 3 conventional DIP <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (<b>TTL)</b> parts and 1 round metal can part.|$|E
50|$|A {{solid state}} {{contactor}} is a heavy-duty solid state relay, including the necessary heat sink, used where frequent on/off cycles are required, such as with electric heaters, small electric motors, and lighting loads. There are no moving parts {{to wear out}} {{and there is no}} contact bounce due to vibration. They are activated by AC control signals or DC control signals from Programmable logic controller (PLCs), PCs, <b>Transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (<b>TTL)</b> sources, or other microprocessor and microcontroller controls.|$|E

50|$|Another early system, the Kenbak-1, was {{released}} in 1971. Like the Datapoint 2200, it used discrete <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> instead of a microprocessor, but it functioned like a microcomputer in some ways. It was marketed as an educational and hobbyist tool, {{but it was not}} a commercial success; production ceased shortly after introduction.|$|R
50|$|A {{logic probe}} is a {{hand-held}} pen-like test probe used for analyzing and troubleshooting the logical states (Boolean 0 or 1) of a digital circuit.
