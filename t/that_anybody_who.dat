25|$|When initial {{assessments}} {{were being}} made for the feasibility of restoring the observatory, both the telescope and observatory were in a poor condition {{as a result of}} years of neglect and an arson attempt by some local children. The telescope is made predominantly from brass and thus suffered minimal corrosion and damage. Most importantly the lens of the telescope survived unscathed allowing for restoration. This was carried out at first by several dedicated parents and governors of the school, amongst them Syd Little. Soon after the basic restoration ideas were raised for a larger project allowing the teaching of astronomy on a larger scale. After getting clearance from the original owners of the telescope {{to go ahead with the}} project, Rossall was given funds from the Lawrence House Trust, an educational charity, to go forward with their plans. The centre had an official opening on 26 September 2006 with Old Rossallian and former Astronomer Royal Sir Francis Graham Smith in attendance. The centre's motto is 'Astronomy For All' meaning that it offers courses to Rossall Students but also at a small cost to the general public. Courses also range from beginner to advanced to ensure <b>that</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> wishes to study Astronomy can do so.|$|E

However, the producers did not know how to fill in episode two, so the death was moved up. According to Wolstencroft, the inclusion of Helen's death was to give the audience the message that [...] "the world of Spooks isn't the world where the cavalry always arrive, because in reality these people [...] do risk their lives on our behalf and they do get into sticky situations with genuinely nasty people." [...] The producers also wanted main characters to die on occasion rather than on a weekly or bi-weekly basis; otherwise it would show MI5 officers as not doing their jobs properly. Although Spooks is a serious show, the writers add occasional humour from the characters. According to Wolstencroft, he felt <b>that</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> works in such an occupation with high responsibilities tends to have humour around, and that those people make jokes even though they have seen [...] "heinous things".

2500|$|Lord Dilhorne, who had polled the Cabinet {{for their}} preferences, had listed Macleod as [...] "voting" [...] for Home.

Macmillan's official biographer Alistair Horne believed that Macleod's description of 17 October as “the key day” is evidence that he “changed his mind”, having not previously had a particularly firm opinion. Macmillan’s view was “well, you know … Macleod was a Highlander!” Others (e.g. Macmillan's biographer D.R.

He replied, [...] "Well I believe it would be—just like lying is sinful and stealing is sinful. There {{are a lot of}} things that are sinful. It doesn't mean that a person is a horrible person. It means that they engage in behavior that is outside the norms of those boundaries of our traditional view of what's right and what's wrong.

2500|$|The Church {{does not}} espouse {{a belief in}} Satan as an entity who {{literally}} exists, and LaVey did not encourage the worship of Satan as a deity. In an interview with David Shankbone, High Priest Peter H. Gilmore stated [...] "My real feeling is <b>that</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> believes in supernatural entities on some level is insane. Whether they believe in the Devil or God, they are abdicating reason". Gilmore defines the word [...] "Satan" [...] as [...] "a model or a mode of behavior", noting that in Hebrew the word means [...] "adversary" [...] or [...] "opposer", which {{can be regarded as}} [...] "one who questions". [...] Gilmore describes Satanism as beginning with atheism, and taking the view that the universe is indifferent: [...] "There’s no God, there’s no Devil. No one cares!" [...] LaVey sought to cement his belief system within the secularist world-view that derived from natural science, thus providing him with an atheistic basis with which to criticize Christianity and other supernaturalist beliefs. He legitimized his religion by highlighting what he claimed was its rational nature, contrasting this with what he saw as the supernaturalist irrationality of established religions.|$|E

[...] According to Michael, just about every anti-Jewish book printed in the Third Reich contained references to and quotations from Luther. Heinrich Himmler (albeit never a Lutheran, having been brought up Catholic) wrote admiringly of his writings and sermons on the Jews in 1940. The city of Nuremberg presented a first edition of On the Jews and their Lies to Julius Streicher, editor of the Nazi newspaper Der Stürmer, on his birthday in 1937; the newspaper described it as the most radically anti-Semitic tract ever published. It was publicly exhibited in a glass case at the Nuremberg rallies and quoted in a 54-page explanation of the Aryan Law by Dr. E.H. Schulz and Dr. R. Frercks.|$|E

We really went in with very little, and focused during that time we were in the studio. Will Yip’s direction and aura in the studio is unbelievable. There is an album title, but we’re not 1,000 percent on it yet; there is a tentative release date, but I can’t say what it is. It’s definitely the most aggressive Circa record we’ve ever made. It’s the first record of ours I’ve been able to listen to front to back without having that song that I’m like, 'Yeah, I could’ve done better here.'

Leibovitz had refused to let them veto any of the photos, which included one of Ronstadt sprawled across a bed in her underpants.
