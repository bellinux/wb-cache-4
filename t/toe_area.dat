25|$|The {{birth of}} the modern pointe shoe is often {{attributed}} to the early 20th-century Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, {{who was one of}} the most famous and influential dancers of her time. Pavlova had particularly high, arched insteps, which left her vulnerable to injury when dancing en pointe. She also had slender, tapered feet, which resulted in excessive pressure on her big toes. To compensate for this, she inserted toughened leather soles into her shoes for extra support and flattened and hardened the <b>toe</b> <b>area</b> to form a box.|$|E
25|$|With modern strap bindings, {{the rider}} wears a boot {{which has a}} thick but {{flexible}} sole, and padded uppers. The foot is held onto the board with two buckle straps – one strapped {{across the top of}} the <b>toe</b> <b>area,</b> and one across the ankle area. They can be tightly ratcheted closed for a tight fit and good rider control of the board. Straps are typically padded to more evenly distribute pressure across the foot. While nowhere near as popular as two-strap bindings, some people prefer three-strap bindings for more specialized riding such as carving. The third strap tends to provide additional stiffness to the binding.|$|E

30|$|Jumping as a {{fundamental}} motion in sports frequently leads to lower limb injuries, primarily due to the rapid shock to lower limbs at landing (Vint and Hinrichs 1996; Doherty et al. 2014). Ankle sprain has been considered {{as one of the}} most common injuries in various sports with frequent jump motion such as volleyball, basketball and soccer. According to the survey, there are approximately 5600 incidences of ankle sprain per day in the UK, a mere between 3 and 5 % of all Emergency Department visits (Pijnenburg et al. 2000). Larger plantar loading at forefoot and <b>toes</b> <b>areas</b> in take-off and landing may increase the risk of metatarsal injuries. However, whether there are differences in ankle motion and plantar loading between habitually barefoot populations and habitually shod populations in jumping remained to be unclear.|$|R
50|$|To improve {{motorcycle}} safety many countries mandate {{the wearing of}} personal protective equipment such as protective clothing and helmets. Protective clothing may include certain types of jackets, gloves, boots, and pants. Jackets meant for motorcyclists are typically made of leather or specialized man-made fabrics like cordura or Kevlar. These jackets typically include heavy padding on the elbow, spine, and shoulder regions. Gloves are generally made of leather or Kevlar and some include carbon fiber knuckle protection. Boots, especially those for sport riding, include reinforcement and plastic caps on the ankle and <b>toe</b> <b>areas.</b> Pants are usually leather, cordura, or Kevlar. Except for helmets, none of these items are required by law in any state in the USA, or {{in any part of}} the UK but are recommended by many of those who ride.|$|R

40|$|Background: To study ground {{reaction}} force (GRF) patterns in stroke patients with {{various degrees of}} motor recovery, using plantar dynamic analysis. Methods: Forty-three people with hemiplegic stroke and 20 healthy subjects {{were enrolled in the}} study. Motor impairment (motor recovery and muscle tone) and plantar dynamic data (GRF patterns, peak pressure, and walking speeds) were analyzed. GRF patterns were categorized into four patterns based on the force magnitude (spatial features) through time (temporal features) of the vertical GRF. Then stroke patients were classified into good (patterns III and IV) and poor groups (patterns I and II). Results: Patients with hemiplegic stroke showed characteristic GRF patterns which could be categorized from bimodal (pattern IV) to pathological shapes (I-III). The peak pressures on the paretic side in the metatarsal and <b>toe</b> <b>areas</b> were reduced in stroke patients compared with those in healthy subjects. Walking speeds were higher in the good group than in the poor group (p < 0. 05). The peak pressures on both sides in the metatarsal and midfoot areas were lowe...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} foot vein incompetence {{in a group of}} patients with chronic venous insufficiency and to assess the association of this, with venous ulceration located on the forefoot. MethodsA total of 20 consecutive patients (21 limbs) with active or healed venous ulceration was prospectively studied with duplex ultrasound of the superficial and plantar foot veins. In these, four extremities had venous ulceration involving the forefoot. Specifically, the superficial venous arch near the metatarsal heads, the foot portion of the great and small saphenous veins, the anterior arch veins on the foot dorsum, and the plantar veins were interrogated with a 12 -MHz probe. ResultsReflux was found in 32 % of pedal vein segments in CEAP C 5, C 6 legs, with ulceration involving only the gaiter area (mean number of incompetent foot segments, 1. 6 ± 1. 2). Pedal reflux was present in 65 % of foot vein segments when forefoot ulceration was present (mean number of incompetent foot segments, 3. 3 ± 1. 3). Student t-test for the difference in the mean number of incompetent foot vein segments was significant (P <. 004). ConclusionsVenous ulceration can affect the forefoot and <b>toe</b> <b>areas</b> and is associated with reflux in the pedal vein segments...|$|R

Conclusions: GRF patterns, correlated with walking speeds, indicate underlying motorcontrol of hemiplegic or hemiparetic gait. Knee motor control may be themost important factor in determining walking performance.

We have modeled tissue freezing in a finger in order to predict combinations of wind speed and temperature {{likely to lead to}} frostbite. Our model incorporates different tissue layers in the finger, sources of heat, transient properties, and heat transfer through convection and conduction. Such a model is valuable because it accurately predicts the existence and extent of tissue freezing. The model uses two tissue layers in the finger because of their disparaging material properties. It also contains a region attached to the finger to simulate heat flux from the hand to the finger. Heat generation was ignored, and heat transfer to the finger from blood flow was accounted for by a source term. The model is axi-symmetric, with radial heat flow into the finger. The edges of the finger have a convection boundary condition, and the region attached to the finger was perfectly insulated. The far edge of the region attached to the finger was set to a constant temperature equal to average body temperature. Each simulation was performed for a time span of thirty minutes for each set of ambient conditions. We then noted whether or not the conditions were conducive to frostbite.

40|$|Custom shoes {{manufacturing}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} challenges facing the footwear industry today. A shoe for everyone: it is a change in the production model in which each individual’s foot is the main focus, replacing traditional size systems based on population means. This paradigm shift represents a major effort for the industry, for which the design and not production becomes the main bottleneck. It is therefore necessary to accelerate the design process by improving the accuracy of current methods. The starting point for making a shoe that fits the client’s foot anatomy is scanning the surface of the foot. Automated foot model reconstruction is accomplished through the use of the self-organising growing neural gas (GNG) network, which is able to topographically map the low dimension of the network to the high dimension of the manifold of the scanner acquisitions without requiring a priori knowledge of the structure of the input space. The GNG obtains a surface representation adapted to the topology of the foot, is accurate, tolerant to noise, and eliminates outliers. It also improves the reconstruction in “dark” areas where the scanner does not obtain information: the heel and <b>toe</b> <b>areas.</b> The method reconstructs the foot surface 4 times more accurately than other well-known methods. The method is generic and easily extensible to other industrial objects that need to be digitized and reconstructed with accuracy and efficiency requirements.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the past}} few years, several studies have tried to {{identify}} clinical limitations of patients suffering from end-stage ankle osteoarthritis. However, very few have attempted to assess foot and ankle function in a more objective biomechanical way, and in particular, using dynamic pedobarography. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore plantar pressure distribution characteristics in a large cohort of patients with end-stage ankle osteoarthritis. METHODS: 120 patients (female, 54; male, 66; 120 cases) suffering from posttraumatic end-stage ankle osteoarthritis were included. The clinical examination consisted of an assessment of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society hindfoot score, a pain score, the range of motion for ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion, and the body mass index. Radiological parameters included the radiological tibiotalar alignment and the radiological ankle osteoarthritis grading. Plantar pressure distribution parameters were assessed using dynamic pedobarography. FINDINGS: Intra-individual comparison between the affected and the opposite feet revealed significant differences for several parameters: maximum force and contact area were decreased in the whole osteoarthritic foot. Peak pressure in the hindfoot and <b>toes</b> <b>area</b> was decreased as well. No correlations could be found between pedobarographic data and clinical parameters, such as hindfoot score, pain score, and range of motion. However, results indicated a positive correlation between dorsiflexion and the pedobarographic parameters. INTERPRETATION: In conclusion, posttraumatic end-stage ankle osteoarthritis leads to significant alterations in plantar pressure distribution. These might be interpreted as an attempt of the patient to reduce the weight-bearing load on the painful ankle. Other explanations include bony deformity and ankle malalignment, as a consequence of either the initial trauma or of the degenerative process itself, pain related disuse atrophy of surrounding muscles, or scarred soft tissue...|$|R

When viewed from the front, the line passes through the knee, ankle joint, and the joints of the second toe or middle <b>toe</b> or the <b>area</b> between those <b>toe</b> joints. In cases of unusually high instep or metatarsal joint flexibility, it is sometimes necessary to flex the toes to achieve proper alignment.|$|R

40|$|Tree frogs {{are able}} to climb smooth, {{vertical}} substrates using specialised toe pads which adhere via an area-based wet adhesive mechanism. Although the link between pads and arboreality in frogs is well-established, few studies have investigated the influence of morphology on adhesion. Trinidadian tree frogs from the genus Hyla are geometrically similar. There is a tendency towards comparatively reduced mass in larger species, but <b>toe</b> pad <b>area</b> increases as expected with isometry. As adhesion is area-dependent, forces are affected directly by the increase in mass relative to pad area, {{and there is a}} decrease in the ability of larger species to adhere to smooth rotation platforms. However, there is an increase in force per unit area that suggests larger species have more efficient toe pads. Toe pad structure is very similar though there are variations in the details of a number of features. Crucially, although differences in morphology appeared small they had demonstrable effects on adhesive efficiency of the pads. Epithelial cell area correlates positively with frog length and adhesive efficiency, related features of cell density and intercellular channel length correlate negatively. These findings are discussed in relation to the different forces involved in the tree frogs’ wet adhesive system...|$|R
40|$|This {{allometric}} {{study of}} adhesion in 15 Trinidadian tree frog species investigates how relationships between length, area and mass limit {{the ability of}} adult frog species of different sizes to adhere to inclined and overhanging surfaces. Our experiments show that hylid frogs possess an area-based wet adhesive system in which larger species are lighter than expected from isometry and adhere better than expected from their <b>toe</b> pad <b>area.</b> However, {{in spite of these}} adaptations, larger species adhere less well than smaller species. In addition to these adhesive forces, tree frogs also generate significant shear forces that scale with mass, suggesting that they are frictional forces. Toe pads detach by peeling and frogs have strategies to prevent peeling from taking place while they are adhering to surfaces, including orienting themselves head-up on slopes. The scaling of tree frog adhesion is also used to distinguish between different models for adhesion, including classic formulae for capillarity and Stefan adhesion. These classic equations grossly overestimate the adhesive forces that tree frogs produce. More promising are peeling models, designed to predict the pull-off forces of adhesive tape. However, more work is required before we can qualitatively and quantitatively describe the adhesive mechanism of tree frogs...|$|R
