5|$|Bound for Glory IV {{took place}} on October 12, 2008 at <b>the</b> <b>Sears</b> Centre in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, where it {{featured}} eight professional wrestling matches. The maximum capacity of <b>the</b> <b>Sears</b> Centre is about 11,800, however, only 5,000 were in attendance for the event. All four of TNA's active championships {{at the time were}} defended at the event. The main event featured Sting defeating TNA World Heavyweight Champion Samoa Joe to become the new champion. Another featured match was Jeff Jarrett versus Kurt Angle with Mick Foley as the Special Guest Enforcer, which Jarrett won. Other matches on the card included a Four-Way Tag Team Monster's Ball match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship with Steve McMichael as the Special Guest Referee, which was won by Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm), who were accompanied by Jacqueline, over the teams of Abyss and Matt Morgan, Brother Ray and Brother Devon—known as Team 3D—and The Latin American Xchange (Homicide and Hernandez); a match involving three competitors, also known as a 3-Way Dance or a Three Way match, resulting in Booker T defeating Christian Cage and A.J. Styles; and Sheik Abdul Bashir defeating Consequences Creed to retain the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E
2500|$|On {{pulling the}} trigger of a wheellock firearm, <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> effects a slight {{rotation}} as described above. The end of <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> arm (that has hitherto locked the wheel and prevented it from turning) is disengaged, leaving the wheel free to turn under the tension of the mainspring. There is a subtlety here that is of vital importance: the [...] "hole" [...] {{in the side of}} the wheel into which <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> engages, is not a parallel-sided shaft. If it were, then under the tremendous tension of the mainspring, it would require a huge force on the trigger to disengage <b>the</b> <b>sear.</b> Nor is <b>the</b> tip of <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> arm cylindrical, which would have a similar effect. Rather, the [...] "hole" [...] is a depression in the wheel (like a small crater), and <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> has a rounded end: the wheel is locked by reason of lateral force on the shaft of the wheel rather than vertical force on <b>the</b> <b>sear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The trigger uses several {{components}} {{that make it}} safe, and yet simple to maintain. Within the trigger there is the long silver-colored AccuRelease lever mounted within the trigger body and sharing the trigger's pivot point in the housing. When at rest, the forward {{upper end of the}} AccuRelease is positioned directly behind <b>the</b> <b>sear,</b> where it will block <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> should any external force cause it to jar out of the trigger notch. In normal operation, the trigger finger will first take up and depress the AccuRelease lever so that its forward tip drops out of the path of <b>the</b> <b>sear,</b> allowing <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> to move fully backward when released by the trigger at whatever weight you have adjusted the trigger pull to be.|$|R

Invisible behind the wheel bracket is the chain linking the end of the mainspring with the eccentric on the wheel shaft. Also not visible are <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> spring (hidden behind <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> arm itself) and <b>the</b> secondary <b>sear</b> (<b>the</b> end can just be seen to the right of the end of <b>the</b> main <b>sear</b> arm). Note <b>the</b> [...] "nose" [...] of <b>the</b> main <b>sear</b> going through a hole in the lock plate where it engages with the wheel on the other side.|$|R
5|$|Prior {{to being}} under State control, the section between Sears Point and Vallejo {{was known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Sears</b> Point Toll Road, a toll road managed by Golden Gate Ferry that was built over an ancient Native American trail. When it was {{purchased}} by the State in 1938, tolls were removed; it then became signed as State Route 48 until 1964.|$|E
5|$|The former Twin Towers of the World Trade Center {{were located}} in Lower Manhattan. At , the 110-story {{buildings}} were the world's tallest from 1972 until they were surpassed by {{the construction of the}} Willis Tower in 1974 (formerly known as <b>the</b> <b>Sears</b> Tower, located in Chicago). One World Trade Center, a replacement for the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, is currently the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|The game's city {{environment}} is modeled after Chicago, including {{many of its}} landmarks, such as the 'L', the Willis Tower (then known as <b>the</b> <b>Sears</b> Tower), Wrigley Field, and Soldier Field. The streets feature a number of objects into which the player can crash, including trash bins, parking meters, mailboxes, and traffic lights. In Checkpoint, other vehicles move in accordance with traffic lights, but the player is {{under no obligation to}} obey them.|$|E
5000|$|After a full {{magazine}} is inserted, the slide is fully retracted and released. This action cocks the hammer, strips a cartridge from the magazine, and chambers it. Rotating the three-position safety lever fully downward, exposing a red warning dot between {{the receiver and}} the hammer pivot pin, renders the pistol ready to fire. Rotating the lever upward to its center position covers the red dot and engages <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> block (allowing [...] "cocked and locked" [...] carry). Finally, rotating the safety lever fully upward decocks the hammer by releasing <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> and intercepting <b>the</b> hammer's forward movement. This position allows safe carry of the pistol with a round in the chamber.The hammer must then be cocked manually and the safety disengaged before a round can be fired. As the trigger is pulled in this state, the trigger bar rotates <b>the</b> <b>sear,</b> a lug on <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> disengages <b>the</b> firing pin safety located directly above it, and {{the opposite side of}} <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> releases <b>the</b> hammer. The hammer then impacts the firing pin, the firing pin impacts the primer of the cartridge, and the shot is fired.|$|R
5000|$|The {{key element}} {{apparently}} added by Marin le Bourgeoys was <b>the</b> vertically acting <b>sear.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sear</b> is a [...] "catch" [...] or [...] "latch" [...] which holds the mechanism {{in a position}} ready to fire; the trigger acts upon, or is part of, <b>the</b> <b>sear,</b> releasing it and allowing a strong spring {{to act on the}} mechanism to fire the gun. Previously <b>the</b> <b>sear,</b> located within <b>the</b> lock, had acted {{through a hole in the}} lockplate to engage the cock on the outside of the plate. <b>The</b> vertically acting <b>sear</b> acted on a piece called the tumbler, on the inside of the lock which was mounted on the same rotating shaft as the cock. This design proved to be the most efficient in terms of cost and reliability.|$|R

A statue of Roy Rogers and a Bona Allen saddle-maker saddling Trigger is located in downtown Buford. The Bona Allen Company thrived during the Great Depression in the 1930s, likely {{as a result of}} the Depression forcing farmers to choose horses over expensive tractors, thereby increasing the demand for saddles, collars, bridles, and other leather products.|$|E
5|$|Bound for Glory IV was a {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion that took place on October12, 2008 at <b>the</b> <b>Sears</b> Centre in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. It was the fourth event under the Bound for Glory name and the tenth event in the 2008 TNA PPV schedule. The show was promoted as TNA's premier PPV event and their equivalent to the rival World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) WrestleMania. Eight professional wrestling matches and one untelevised match were featured on the event's card, four of which were for championships.|$|E
5|$|Bushnell and Gene Lipkin, Atari's {{vice-president}} of sales, approached toy and electronic retailers to sell Home Pong, but were rejected. Retailers felt {{the product was}} too expensive and would not interest consumers. Atari contacted <b>the</b> <b>Sears</b> Sporting Goods department after noticing a Magnavox Odyssey advertisement in the sporting goods section of its catalog. Atari staff discussed {{the game with a}} representative, Tom Quinn, who expressed enthusiasm and offered the company an exclusive deal. Believing they could find more favorable terms elsewhere, Atari's executives declined and continued to pursue toy retailers. In January 1975, Atari staff set up a Home Pong booth at a toy trade fair in New York City, but was unsuccessful in soliciting orders {{due to the fact that}} they did not know that they needed a private showing.|$|E
50|$|The trigger assembly, mounted {{inside the}} receiver, is {{operated}} by the mainspring and suitable for automatic fire. It has no single shot mode. The manual rotating type safety locks <b>the</b> <b>sear,</b> which engages <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> notch of <b>the</b> bolt carrier assembly, and the trigger lug does not allow the bolt earner assembly {{to go all the}} way back.|$|R

50|$|In a firearm, <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> is <b>the</b> part of {{the trigger}} {{mechanism}} that holds the hammer, striker, or bolt back until the correct amount of pressure {{has been applied to}} the trigger; at which point the hammer, striker, or bolt is released to discharge <b>the</b> weapon. <b>The</b> <b>sear</b> may be a separate part or can be a surface incorporated into the trigger.|$|R
5|$|Dominating the {{appearance}} of the house from the street is a large verandah-style porch, supported by large stone columns, on the southern-facing front of the house; an enclosed porch, smaller but two stories high and supported by wooden pillars, is located on the rear portion of the house's east side. Projecting {{from the front of the}} house, above the porch, is a small wing with a gable, semicircular window, and elaborate cornice. The house is built in a combination of styles; it includes many Italianate details, but its design appears to have been influenced by the architecture of <b>the</b> <b>Sears</b> Modern Homes.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{conclusive}} evidence explaining why the Dibbles chose to place Gothic {{windows on the}} upper level. The windows {{are believed to have}} been purchased through <b>the</b> <b>Sears</b> catalog. There are two commonly accepted theories: the Dibbles may have wanted the windows to beautify their home at a time when rural life in Iowa was a struggle, or they could have been following a trend in which extravagant details were desirable in residences in the late nineteenth century, and the Dibbles chose windows whose costs would have been relatively reasonable at the time.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} {{reported}} attendance figures for Bound for Glory IV, {{with the initial}} attendance figure being 5,000 people before being retracted and updated {{to a total of}} 5,500 people by The Wrestling Observer Newsletter. This was lower than the maximum seating capacity available at <b>the</b> <b>Sears</b> Centre of between 11,000 and 11,800 people for festival style events. However, the Bound for Glory IV setup caused the event to only hold a maximum capacity of 8,000 people. Of the 5,500 that attended the show, only 4,500 of them were paid tickets. Despite this, it was seen as one of the largest paid crowds in the company's history {{and one of the most}} responsive crowds the company has had as well. The Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that 35,000 people bought the event.|$|E
5000|$|The {{poor design}} of the breech allowed the Type 94 Nambu to be fired unintentionally. <b>The</b> <b>sear</b> bar on <b>the</b> Type 94 Nambu {{converts}} the forward pull of the trigger into a lateral movement that frees the hammer. Because <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> bar is {{on the outside of}} the pistol, it could be jarred loose during engagement if the pistol was cocked and handled carelessly. The forward end of <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> bar would need to be depressed approximately 2mm to cause the weapon to fire. The ability to fire the Type 94 without pulling the trigger gave rise to war stories of Japanese soldiers surrendering, only to fire the pistol, earning the pistol monikers such as the [...] "suicide special" [...] and the [...] "surrender pistol". These stories are widely discredited because of the difficulty to fire the weapon by squeezing <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> bar. If <b>the</b> safety is engaged on the Type 94 it is impossible for the weapon to discharge unintentionally.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the slide}} of the pistol enters battery, the striker engages <b>the</b> <b>sear.</b> At this point, <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> is held {{back in a}} {{partially}} cocked condition. When the trigger of the M&P is pulled, the trigger bar first engages the firing pin safety plunger, lifting it upward, and releasing firing pin safety. At the rearward extreme of the trigger bar's travel, it engages <b>the</b> <b>sear.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sear</b> is rotated downward by the trigger bar, fully cocking, then releasing the striker. The striker makes contact with the primer of the chambered round, which in turn ignites the gunpowder and propels the bullet forward. According to renowned M&P gunsmith Dan Burwell, the angle on the rear face of <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> creates a camming action against the striker. This camming action moves the striker to the rear very slightly during the trigger pull, thus finishing the [...] "cocking". This system {{is similar to the}} partially tensioned striker found in the Glock series of pistols. When the pistol cycles for the next shot, the striker will be automatically pre-set in a 98% cocked position. Because the striker is only 98% cocked prior to the trigger being pulled, Smith & Wesson classifies the M&P's action as [...] "striker fired (double action only)".|$|R
5000|$|When {{the hammer}} is pulled {{backwards}} the internal spring compresses, exerting exponential pressure against the hammer's continued backwards motion. As the hammer and spring mechanism reaches {{the far end}} of its backwards range of travel, it is caught and locked in place by a metal catching device known as <b>the</b> <b>sear.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sear</b> holds <b>the</b> hammer in place, allowing the kinetic energy of the bolt's forward motion to be released whenever <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> is depressed. As the trigger is pulled, <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> becomes depressed and allows the hammer to be propelled forward by the spring. The hammer collides with the valve releasing gas from the external pressurized tank into the internal bolt chamber. The ensuing burst of gas channels out {{the front end of the}} bolt, propelling the paintball down the barrel. The rest of the gas pushes backwards on the hammer, pushing both it and the bolt backwards until the mechanism is once again caught on <b>the</b> <b>sear.</b> Once caught, <b>the</b> hammer is ready to repeat the blowback process. In cases where the pressure from the storage vessel drops under the minimum required to complete the action's cycle, the marker may [...] "runaway" [...] firing rapidly without additional trigger pulls required.|$|R
5|$|Home Pong was {{an instant}} success {{following}} its limited 1975 release through Sears; around 150,000units were sold that holiday season. The game became Sears' most successful product at the time, which earned Atari a Sears Quality Excellence Award. Similar to the arcade version, several companies released clones {{to capitalize on the}} home console's success, many of which continued to produce new consoles and video games. Magnavox re-released their Odyssey system with simplified hardware and new features, and would later release updated versions. Coleco entered the video game market with their Telstar console; it features three Pong variants and was also succeeded by newer models. Nintendo released the Color TV Game 6 in 1977, which plays six variations of electronic tennis. The next year, it was followed by an updated version, the Color TV Game 15, which features fifteen variations. The systems were Nintendo's entry into the home video game market and the first to produce themselves—they had previously licensed the Magnavox Odyssey. The dedicated Pong consoles and the numerous clones have since become varying levels of rare; Atari's Pong consoles are common, while APF Electronics' TV Fun consoles are moderately rare. Prices among collectors, however, vary with rarity; <b>the</b> <b>Sears</b> Tele-Games versions are often cheaper than those with the Atari brand.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Sears Holdings Corporation {{introduced}} <b>the</b> <b>Sears</b> Essentials store format, {{which was}} supposed be like a Sears store and a Kmart store mixed together.
