40|$|Aim It is {{uncertain}} whether hypocalcaemia {{is associated with}} an increased risk of bleeding. This study assessed the dose-related relationship between ionised calcium concentrations and in vitro clot strength measured by maximum amplitude (MA) on the <b>thromboelastograph</b> (TEG). Methods A total of 610 patients who were at risk of bleeding or had active bleeding between 2010 and 2014 were considered in this retrospective cohort study. A scatter plot with Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and multiple linear regression was used to assess the dose-related relationship between ionised calcium concentrations and MA on the TEG.

40|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether reactive thrombocytosis {{is associated with}} an increased risk of thrombosis. This prospective case-control study assessed the in vitro thrombotic tendency of patients with reactive thrombocytosis. Forty-eight patients with reactive thrombocytosis, defined by platelet count > 500 × 109 /l and 55 similar, randomly selected critically ill patients who did not have reactive thrombocytosis were considered. In vitro thrombotic tendency in both groups of patients was assessed using maximal amplitude (normal range 54 to 72 mm) and alpha angle (normal range 47 to 74 °) on the <b>thromboelastograph.</b> The associations between reactive thrombocytosis and C-reactive protein, the coagulation profile and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score were also evaluated. Patients with reactive thrombocytosis had an associated increased in vitro thrombotic tendency (maximal amplitude 77 vs 69 mm, mean difference 8 mm, 95 % confidence interval 4. 9 to 10. 9, P= 0. 001), a higher fibrinogen concentration (7. 2 vs 5. 8 g/l, P= 0. 003), and a higher incidence of infection requiring antibiotics (50 vs 27 %, P= 0. 025) compared to patients without thrombocytosis. Platelet count had a relatively linear relationship with the maximal amplitude and the alpha angle of the <b>thromboelastograph</b> tracing (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0. 53, P= 0. 001). In the multivariate analysis, only reactive thrombocytosis (odds ratio 5. 9, 95 % confidence interval 1. 3 - 27. 8, P= 0. 025) and activated partial thromboplastin time (odds ratio 0. 93 per second increment, 95 % confidence interval 0. 87 to 0. 99, P= 0. 016) were significantly associated with a strong in vitro thrombotic tendency. In summary, reactive thrombocytosis was associated with infection requiring antibiotics and evidence of increased in vitro thrombotic tendency in critically ill patients...|$|E
40|$|Trauma {{patients}} {{are at a}} high risk of both bleeding and thromboembolism. This study assessed whether conventional coagulation blood tests were reliable predictors of an increased in vitro thrombotic and bleeding tendency of trauma and non-trauma patients. Conventional coagulation blood tests and thromboelastographs of 63 trauma and 63 randomly selected, critically ill non-trauma patients were compared. Increased in vitro thrombotic and bleeding tendencies were defined by a maximum amplitude> 72 mm or an angle> 74 ° on the <b>thromboelastograph</b> and a maximum amplitude 1. 5) and activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (> 40 seconds) were, however, not significantly associated with an increased in vitro thrombotic or bleeding tendency. In conclusion, in vitro thrombotic tendency was more common than bleeding tendency in critically ill trauma and non-trauma patients.

Additional Keyphrases: fibrinolysis #{ 149 }streptokinase thera-py #{ 149 }clot lysis inhibition #{ 149 }thermistor Currently, the study of fibrinolysis is beset by problems of methodology (1).

40|$|The {{tissue factor}} (TF) /factor (F) VIIa complex {{is the primary}} {{initiator}} of coagulation in vivo. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is the physiological inhibitor of the TF/FVIIa complex. Deficiencies of either TF or TFPI have not been reported in humans, and a complete absence of either of these two proteins in mice is embryonically lethal. To maintain normal hemostasis, levels of TF and TFPI need to be balanced. Increased levels of TF can overwhelm the inhibitory capacity of TFPI, resulting in thrombosis. Decreased levels of TF are associated with bleeding. Global assays of coagulation are defined as tests capable of evaluating all components of the clotting cascade that are present in plasma. In these tests the thrombogenic surface is either provided by platelets or exogenous phospholipids. Clotting assays currently used in clinical practice are not designed to measure endogenous levels of TF and TFPI. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop sensitive and specific assays for measuring levels of functional TF and TFPI in whole blood and plasma. These assays could be useful in patient management in many scenarios. Keywords Tissue factor; tissue factor pathway inhibitor; thrombosis; <b>thromboelastograph...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Prasugrel {{is a novel}} {{antiplatelet}} prodrug of {{the same}} thienopyridine class as clopidogrel and ticlopidine. Metabolism of prasugrel generates the active metabolite R- 138727, an antagonist of the platelet P 2 Y(12) adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor, leading to inhibition of ADP-mediated platelet activation and aggregation. ADP also enhances the platelet response to collagen, and these two agonists contribute to the generation of platelet procoagulant activity. We therefore examined whether R- 138727 inhibits ADP- and collagen-triggered platelet procoagulant activities. METHODS AND RESULTS: As shown by whole blood flow cytometry, R- 138727 inhibited surface phosphatidylserine expression on ADP plus collagen-stimulated platelets and tissue factor (TF) expression on ADP-, collagen-, and ADP plus collagen-stimulated monocyte-platelet aggregates. R- 138727 reduced monocyte-platelet aggregate formation, thereby further inhibiting TF expression. ADP, collagen, and ADP plus collagen accelerated the kinetics of thrombin generation in recalcified whole blood and R- 138727 significantly inhibited this acceleration. Clot strength in a modified <b>thromboelastograph</b> system was also inhibited by R- 138727 (IC 50 0. 7 +/- 0. 1 microM). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to its previously known inhibitory effects on platelet activation and aggregation, the active metabolite of prasugrel, R- 138727, inhibits platelet procoagulant activity in whole blood (as determined by phosphatidylserine expression on platelets and TF expression on monocyte-platelet aggregates), resulting in the functional consequences of delayed thrombin generation and impaired clot development...|$|E
40|$|Deep venous {{thromboembolism}} and {{pulmonary embolism}} are still underdiagnosed in the ICU. Thromboelastography (TEG) has shown considerable variability in {{sensitivity and specificity}} {{as a predictor of}} venous thromboembolism (VTE). We designed a prospective double-blind observational study to predict the risk of VTE using TEG in a cohort of critically ill patients. Seventy-two hours after admission in the ICU and consequent prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin, we performed compressive color-Doppler ultrasound and diagnosed deep venous thrombosis. Computed tomography scan was performed for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism if pulmonary embolism was suspected based on physical examination and transthoracic echocardiography. Whole blood samples were obtained from central venous lines 6 - 8  h after subcutaneous administration of low-molecular-weight heparin. Native TEG and modified heparinase TEG were performed using a <b>Thromboelastograph</b> Coagulation Analyzer. Fifty-seven patients were consecutively enrolled of which six (10. 5 %) developed deep venous thrombosis; two (3. 5 %) also developed pulmonary embolism. The native thrombodynamic ratio (TDR) was an independent predictor of the odds of thrombosis (odds ratio 1. 016, P <  0. 05, 95 % confidence interval 1. 008 - 1. 047), with a 0. 93 area under the ROC curve. Using 10. 6 as the lower cut-off point, TDR showed 100 % sensitivity and 0 negative likelihood ratio (95 % confidence interval 0 - 0. 4) in excluding the clinical diagnosis of VTE.

Our findings are in agreement with those reported by other investigators, who demonstrated that a TDR less that 10 is associated with prophylactic levels of anti-Xa...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedBackground: The <b>thromboelastograph</b> (TEG) is a point-of-care global {{hemostasis}} assay {{that measures}} clot formation and their physical properties, and is licensed {{for use in}} monitoring coagulation during complex surgical procedures, but has recently been investigated to monitor patients with bleeding disorders. Although {{attempts have been made}} to use the TEG to detect hypercoagulable states, the results have been inconsistent.; Objectives: To develop novel methods utilizing the TEG which are sensitive to detecting hypercoagulability by demonstrating that baseline TEG parameters can be consistently changed so that they will be sensitive to hypercoagulable conditions.; Patients/Methods: To make the TEG more sensitive to detecting hypercoagulability, several pre-analytic modifications were tested on whole blood from healthy adult volunteers with the goal of prolonging the standard clot initiation and clot propagation times. Methods, which resulted in consistent and reliable desired changes, utilized corn trypsin inhibitor (CTI), a contact pathway inhibitor, and blood samples that were not activated. In order to demonstrate that these methods are sensitive to detecting hypercoagulability, increasing concentrations of recombinant human thrombin were added.; Results: The novel methods were able to consistently and statistically significantly change the baseline TEG parameters of R time, K time, and MA in the desired direction. In addition, the novel methods were able to detect increasing concentrations of thrombin.; Conclusions: We describe novel TEG methods which are sensitive to the presence of increasing concentrations of thrombin in vitro.

40|$|ObjectiveWe evaluated, in a {{randomized}} controlled trial, {{the safety and}} effectiveness of intraoperative cell salvage and autotransfusion of washed salvaged red blood cells after first-time coronary artery bypass grafting performed on the beating heart. MethodsSixty-one patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery were prospectively randomized to autotransfusion (n = 30; receiving autotransfused washed blood from intraoperative cell salvage) or control (n = 31; receiving homologous blood only as blood-replacement therapy). Homologous blood was given according to unit protocols. ResultsThe groups were well matched with respect to demographic and comorbid characteristics. Patients in the autotransfusion group had a significantly higher 24 -hour postoperative hemoglobin concentration (11. 9 g/dL; SD, 1. 41 g/dL) {{than those in the}} control group (10. 5 g/dL; SD, 1. 37 g/dL) (mean difference, 1. 02 g/dL; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 60 - 0. 44 g/dL; P =. 0007), as well as a 20 % reduction in the frequency of homologous blood product use (11 / 31 vs 5 / 30; P =. 095). Autotransfusion of washed red blood cells was not associated with any derangement of <b>thromboelastograph</b> values or laboratory measures of clotting pathway function (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen levels), increased postoperative bleeding, fluid requirements, or adverse clinical events. There was no statistical difference between groups in the total operation, hospitalization, and management costs per patient (median difference, $ 1015. 90 [US dollars]; 95 % confidence interval, −$ 2260 to $ 206; P =. 11).

40|$|Background: Bleeding {{complications}} in {{cardiac surgery}} {{may lead to}} increased morbidity and mortality. Traditional blood coagulation tests are not always suitable to detect rapid changes in the patient's coagulation status. Point-of-care instruments such as the TEG (<b>thromboelastograph)</b> and RoTEM (thromboelastometer) {{have been shown to}} be useful as a guide for the clinician in the choice of blood products and they may lead to a reduction in the need for blood transfusion, contributing to better patient blood management. Methods: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of the TEG, RoTEM and Sonoclot instruments to detect changes in hemostasis in elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and to investigate possible correlations between variables from these three instruments and routine hematological coagulation tests. Blood samples from thirty-five adult patients were drawn before and after surgery and analyzed in TEG, RoTEM, Sonoclot and routine coagulation tests. Data were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance and Pearson's test for linear correlation. Results: We found significant changes for all TEG variables after surgery, for three of the RoTEM variables, and for one variable from the Sonoclot. There were significant correlations postoperatively between plasma fibrinogen levels and variables from the three instruments. Conclusions: TEG and RoTEM may be used to detect changes in hemostasis following cardiac surgery with CPB. Sonoclot seems to be less suitable to detect such changes. Variables from the three instruments correlated with plasma fibrinogen and could be used to monitor treatment with fibrinogen concentrate. © 2014 Espinosa et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

40|$|Background. The {{development}} of hydroxyethyl starches (HES) with low impact on blood coagulation but higher volume effect {{compared with the}} currently used HES solutions is of clinical interest. We hypothesized that high molecular weight, low-substituted HES might possess these properties. Methods. Thirty pigs were infused with three different HES solutions (20 ml kg− 1) with {{the same degree of}} molar substitution (0. 42) but different molecular weights (130, 500 and 900 kDa). Serial blood samples were taken over 24 h and blood coagulation was assessed by Thromboelastograph® analysis and analysis of plasma coagulation. In addition, plasma concentration and in vivo molecular weight were determined and pharmacokinetic data were computed based on a two-compartment model. Results. <b>Thromboelastograph</b> analysis and plasma coagulation tests did not reveal a more pronounced alteration of blood coagulation with HES 500 and HES 900 compared with HES 130. In contrast, HES 500 and HES 900 had a greater area under the plasma concentration-time curve [1542 (142) g min litre− 1, P< 0. 001, 1701 (321) g min litre− 1, P< 0. 001] than HES 130 [1156 (223) g min litre− 1] and alpha half life (emptyt_α^ 1 / 2) was longer for HES 500 [53. 8 (8. 6) min, P< 0. 01] and HES 900 [57. 1 (12. 3) min, P< 0. 01] than for HES 130 [39. 9 (10. 7) min]. Beta half life (emptyt_β^ 1 / 2), however, was similar for all three types of HES [from 332 (100) to 381 (63) min]. Conclusions. In low-substituted HES, molecular weight is not a key factor in compromising blood coagulation.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{assessed}} the effects of changes in pH, temperature, and their combination in whole blood on thromboelastographic variables. Blood was collected from six healthy volunteers. <b>Thromboelastograph</b> (TEG series 5000; Haemoscope Corporation, Illinois, USA) channels were set at temperatures of 32, 37, and 39 degrees C and each was filled with artificially acidified, alkalified, and neutral blood, respectively. Acidification (pH 6. 95) significantly impairs thromboelastographic variables reaction time r (from 23. 3 to 33. 7 min; P = 0. 0280), kinetic time k (from 8. 7 to 16. 1 min; P = 0. 028), angle a (from 24. 3 degrees to 13. 8 degrees; P = 0. 028), prothrombin time (from 11. 4 to 12. 1 s; P = 0. 044), and {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (from 29. 3 to 45. 0 s; P = 0. 028). A temperature drop from 37 to 32 degrees C in blood of neutral pH significantly impaired k (from 8. 7 to 10. 2 min; P = 0. 028) and alpha (from 24. 3 degrees to 21. 0 degrees; P = 0. 027), whereas maximum amplitude ma significantly increased (from 46. 5 to 52. 5 mm; P = 0. 027). A temperature rise from 37 to 39 degrees C at pH 7. 37 did not affect any of the TEG variables. Artificial alkalization (pH 7. 68) at a temperature of 37 degrees C had no effect on any of the measured variables. Acidosis causes a significant impairment of clot formation and clot strength. Hypothermia had the same effects, but to a lesser extent. These findings emphasize the need for correction of acidosis and hypothermia to normalize haemostasis.

40|$|Neonatal alloimmune {{thrombocytopenia}} (NAIT) {{is caused}} by maternal alloantibodies against fetal platelet antigens inherited from the father and which are absent from maternal platelets. In Caucasians, antibodies against the Leu 33 (HPA- 1 a) polymorphism of integrin β 3 (part of the platelet αIIbβ 3 complex) account for > 70 % of cases. Antenatal screening for these antibodies does not currently {{take place in the}} UK, partly because of the absence of sensitive, predictive tests. We hypothesized that the poor sensitivity and predictive abilities of current assays are due to the use of β 3 in an inappropriate conformation, resulting in sub-optimal binding of HPA- 1 a antibodies. We hypothesized firstly that in vitro induced changes to αIIbβ 3 might alter accessibility of the HPA- 1 a epitopes to alloantibodies, thus reducing assay sensitivity. Secondly, we hypothesized that HPA- 1 a antibodies are stimulated by, and preferentially recognise, β 3 in association with αv, a molecule present on placental syncytiotrophoblasts, and that reactivity against platelet αIIbβ 3 reflects only cross-reactivity with αvβ 3. Our first hypothesis was proven by demonstrating that use of the cation chelating compound EDTA, used by many diagnostic laboratories as a component of assay reagents or present in blood samples as anticoagulant, resulted in significantly reduced assay sensitivity. These findings were confirmed in an international workshop. Support for our second hypothesis was provided by demonstrating enhanced reactivity of a small panel of examples of anti-HPA- 1 a against αvβ 3 compared to αIIbβ 3 and by molecular modelling data. We also showed that HPA- 1 a antibodies can inhibit platelet function by using a novel application of the ROTEM® delta <b>thromboelastograph</b> and an immunofluorescence assay in which we demonstrated blocking of platelet function using a monoclonal antibody, PAC- 1, that binds only to activated αIIbβ 3. These studies provide possible explanations for the poor sensitivity and predictive abilities of current assays and suggest further areas for research.

40|$|Background: Homozygous or double {{heterozygous}} factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency {{is characterized}} by soft tissue hematomas, intracranial and delated spontaneous bleeding. Alterations of thromboelastographic (TEG) parameters in these patients have been reported. The aim {{of the study was}} to show results of TEG, TEG Lysis (Lys 60) induced by subthreshold concentrations of streptokinase (SK), and to compare them to the clot solubility studies results in samples of a 1 year old girl with homozygous or double heterozygous FXIII deficiency. Materials and Methods: Case: A one year girl with history of bleeding from umbilical cord. During her first year of live several hematomas in soft upper limb tissue after punctures for vaccination and a gluteal hematoma appeared. One additional sample of a heterozygous and three of acquired FXIII deficiency were also evaluated. Materials and Methods: clotting tests, von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen and activity,  plasma FXIII-A (pFXIII-A) subunit were measured by an immunoturbidimetric assays in a foto-optical coagulometer. Solubility tests were performed with Ca 2 +- 5 M urea and thrombin- 2 % acetic acid. Basal and post FXIII concentrate infusion samples were studied. TEG was performed with CaCl 2 or CaCl 2 + SK (3. 2 U/mL) in a <b>Thromboelastograph.</b> Results: Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time, fibrinogen, factor VIIIc, vWF and platelet aggregation were normal. Antigenic pFXIII-A subunit was 16 hours) 1 day post FXIII infusion. Analysis of FXIII deficient and normal plasma mixtures (< 2 - 102 % of pFXIII-A), showed that Ca-urea solubility was abnormal at pFXIII-A < 9 %, thrombin-acetic acid at pFXIII-A< 18 %, but TEG MA and elasticity at 23 % and Lys 60 with SK at pFXIII-A< 40 %. Conclusions: TEG parameters MA and elasticity, and Lys 60 in TEG with Ca 2 + and in TEG Ca 2 + and SK are more sensitive to low levels of pFXIII than solubility tests. The increased Lys 60 induced by subthreshold concentration of SK could probably reflect the clot characteristics “in vivo” in many patients with pFXIII levels between 5 - 40 % and could be potentially considered as screening test...|$|E
40|$|Background Low {{molecular}} weight heparin is routinely used for thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy and the puerperium. Consensus guidelines recommend waiting 10 – 12 h after administration of a thromboprophylactic dose of low {{molecular weight}} heparin before performing a neuraxial block or removing an epidural catheter. Thromboelastography (TEG®) {{has been reported to}} be sensitive to the effects of enoxaparin 4 h after administration. The purpose of this study was to use TEG to examine coagulation changes in the first 10 h after a thromboprophylactic dose of tinzaparin in an attempt to ratify the current consensus guidelines about timing of neuraxial blockade and epidural catheter removal. Methods Twenty-four women who had undergone caesarean delivery and were classified as low or intermediate risk of thrombosis were recruited. Blood samples were taken before subcutaneous administration of tinzaparin 4500 IU, and at 4, 8 and 10 h post-dose. Standard TEG analyses were performed using plain and heparinase cuvettes and samples were also sent for laboratory anti-Xa assay. <b>Thromboelastograph</b> profiles were analysed for a {{low molecular weight}} heparin effect. Results Analysis revealed no significant differences in R time, K time, alpha angle or maximum amplitude between plain and heparinase samples at any time point. Apart from a small statistically significant (P= 0. 033) decrease in maximum amplitude of 2. 8 % (95 % CI 0. 3 to 5. 4 %) at 4 h, there were no significant changes in coagulation for any TEG parameter. Anti-Xa levels were virtually undetectable in all patients over the 10 h period (median 0. 00 U/mL; range 0. 00 – 0. 13 U/mL). Conclusion A thromboprophylactic dose of tinzaparin 4500 IU had little detectable effect on coagulation as assessed by TEG and anti-Xa assay. These findings support consensus guidelines which state that it is acceptable to perform neuraxial blockade or remove an epidural catheter 10 – 12 h after a thromboprophylactic dose of tinzaparin. Rather than suggesting a lack of anticoagulant activity, the findings indicate that TEG may not have the sensitivity to detect a tinzaparin effect when this dose is used in this patient group...|$|E
40|$|Background & objectives: Coagulation and {{haemostasis}} are dynamic processes. The haemostatic {{changes in}} liver disease affect {{all aspects of}} coagulation. The prothrombin time (PT) / international normalized ratio (INR) was developed to monitor oral anticoagulant therapy and the {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} to investigate inheritable single factor deficiencies. Viscoelastic tests such as thromboelastogram (TEG) give information about dynamics of clot formation (coagulation factor and anticoagulant activity), clot strength (platelets and fibrinogen) and clot stability (finbrinolysis and factor XIII). Administration of blood products before invasive procedures is still guided by INR and platelet count in patients of liver disease. This study was aimed to evaluate the validity of TEG to predict post-procedural bleed after central venous cannulation in patients with cirrhosis. Methods: Ninety patients aged 20 - 70 yr diagnosed with liver cirrhosis requiring elective central venous catheter (CVC) insertion were studied. Platelet count, INR, serum creatinine, TEG and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score were recorded before the procedure. Right-sided internal jugular vein was cannulated. On the basis of presence or absence of post-procedural bleed, patients were divided into bleeding and non-bleeding groups. The CTP score, component of TEG (R - reaction time, K - coagulation time, MA - maximum amplitude and α - angle) and laboratory parameters of both the groups were compared. Results: Bleeding was seen more when CTP scores were ≥ 10 (P= 0. 05). The K time of 3. 05 min or more on <b>thromboelastograph</b> {{was a significant predictor of}} bleeding [area under the curve (AUC) 0. 694, P= 0. 047]. MA of 48. 8 mm or more was a significant predictor of non-bleeding. INR ≥ 2. 6 was a significant predictor of bleeding (AUC 0. 765, P= 0. 005). K time had a low-positive predictive value of 20 per cent and the positive and negative likelihood ratios of 1. 87 and 0. 48, respectively.

40|$|SUMMARY P 2 Y 12 {{receptor}} antagonists including clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor {{in addition}} toaspirin are {{the standard of}} care for the treatment in acute coronary syndrome andpercutaneous coronary intervention. The benefit of this therapy {{is based on the}} balance between the reduction of ischaemic events and minimising bleeding risk. Therefore, it isimportant to have strategies to both ensure the optimal inhibition of the P 2 Y 12 receptor andthe effective prevention and treatment of bleeding events. These form the basis for our three studies. In the first study, we demonstrated in 241 patients after an acute coronary syndrome, thefeasibility of individualised P 2 Y 12 receptor antagonist therapy based on rapid genotyping to identify common CYP 2 C 19 polymorphisms associated with clopidogrel metabolism. Our findings show that this strategy, when combined with follow up point-of-care platelet function testing, almost eliminated high on-treatment platelet reactivity (2. 9 %) and allowed the more judicious use of prasugrel therapy, thereby minimising both thrombotic and bleeding risk. In the latter two studies, we examined in an ex-vivo and in-vivo model the biological efficacy of platelet transfusion in the restoration of platelet function in patients on P 2 Y 12 receptor antagonists. In 35 patients receiving loading doses of clopidogrel and prasugrel for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) we demonstrated that increasing proportions of platelets are needed reverse stronger P 2 Y 12 inhibition. In the ex-vivo model, we showed that in 33 cardiac surgery patients on P 2 Y 12 receptor antagonists that were given platelet transfusion for perioperative bleeding, there was a 30 % increase in platelet activation vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation platetet reactivity index (PRI), a sensitive marker of platelet activation. Platelet transfusion was also associated with changes in the rate and strength of clot formation as assessed by <b>thromboelastograph</b> (TEG). In conclusion, we demonstrated strategies to best identify patients outside the therapeutic window of P 2 Y 12 receptor antagonism using rapid genetic and point-of-care platelet function platforms, allowing the tailored selection of treatment with the potential to avoid future adverse clinical events. For those presenting with bleeding events, we showed the biological efficacy of the strategy of platelet transfusion for the rapid reversal of P 2 Y 12 therapy in both the ACS/PCI and the cardiac surgery setting...|$|E
40|$|Snake envenomations {{are often}} medical {{emergencies}} and occur regularly in dogs. Snake venom contains hundreds of enzymes, proteins and peptides that assist in paralysing, killing and digesting prey, or as a defence against predators. Multiple snake venom components affect haemostasis in the victim. Inadvertent activation of coagulation may also result from expression of {{large amounts of}} tissue factor (TF) from injured tissues at the envenomation site, especially with potent cytotoxic venoms. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the haemostatic functions in dogs envenomed by two South African snakes (Bitis arietans and Naja annulifera) using thromboelastography and traditional plasma-based coagulation assays. This prospective study included 18 client-owned dogs, of which nine dogs were envenomed by African puffadder and nine by snouted cobra. Blood was collected at presentation and at 24 hours post-envenomation. Complete blood count, thromboelastography (TEG), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), antithrombin (AT) activity and C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen (Fib) concentrations were measured. Ten healthy client-owned dogs served as controls. These dogs were presented for routine ovariohysterectomy, castration or blood donation. Haematologic and haemostatic assay results at presentation were compared between groups using ANCOVA (analysis of covariance), and results over time between the puffadder and cobra groups were compared using linear mixed models at 5 % significance. At presentation, the mean TEG R-time was significantly prolonged in the puffadder group when compared to the cobra and control groups (P= 0. 01 and 0. 05, respectively). Visual appraisal of the thromboelastograms at presentation revealed that 5 / 9 (56 %) of puffadder-envenomed dogs had hypocoagulable thromboelastograms as was demonstrated by prolonged R-time and decreased Angle (á), maximal amplitude (MA) and global clot strength (G). Despite this observation of hypocoagulability, none of the other TEG parameters (á, MA or G) were significantly decreased when compared to the cobra and control groups. This finding of hypocoagulability was surprising, because puffadder venom is cytotoxic, often inducing severe tissue necrosis and potentially leading to limb loss and disability in people. It therefore seems that certain components in puffadder venom affect the <b>thromboelastograph</b> by either interfering with or consuming coagulation factors, resulting in a hypocoagulable tracing. It is also possible that this is a dose-dependent effect, with only dogs with a significant amount of envenoming demonstrating this phenomenon. This effect appears to be transient, as 6 / 8 dogs (one fatality) envenomed by puffadders reverted to a severely hypercoagulable state at 24 hours post-envenomation. One dog was still hypocoagulable and one dog that was hypocoagulable became normocoagulable but still had a prolonged R-time. In the cobra-envenomed group hypercoagulable thromboelastograms were observed in 5 / 9 (56 %) dogs at presentation as was demonstrated by increased MA and G. At 24 hours post-envenomation all cobra-envenomed dogs demonstrated hypercoagulable thromboelastograms. This hypercoagulability at presentation and 24 hours post-envenoming was not statistically significant between groups. This hypercoagulable state was likely due to tissue factor-activated coagulation promoted by inflammation at the envenomation site. At presentation, marked thrombocytopenia was evident in the puffadder-envenomed dogs when compared to the cobras and controls (P= 0. 04 and 0. 001, respectively). Thrombocytopenia following puffadder envenomation has been reported in dogs and baboons. Components have been identified in puffadder venom that interfere with platelet function either by inhibiting or promoting aggregation. At 24 hours post-envenomation mean platelet count (Plt) was mildly increased compared to its value at presentation in the puffadder-envenomed dogs. There were Plt abnormalities in the cobra-envenomed dogs at presentation or at 24 hours post-envenomation. Marked leucocytosis was detected in the puffadder-envenomed dogs at presentation when compared to the cobras and controls (P= 0. 003 and 0. 001, respectively) and was more severe at 24 hours post-envenomation when compared to the cobra group (P= 0. 01). Leucocytosis has been reported in different types of snake envenoming including puffadder-envenomed dogs. C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration at presentation was below the lowest detection limit for most dogs (14 / 18) in this study. At 24 hours post-envenoming all but two dogs (one each in the puffadder and cobra groups) had severely elevated CRP. This increase in CRP was statistically significant in both puffadder and cobra-envenomed dogs when compared to its concentration at presentation (P= 0. 04 and 0. 001, respectively). Fibrinogen (Fib) concentration was not elevated in any envenomed dogs at presentation, but increased 24 hours post-envenoming. Although this increase was not statistically significant, an increase would suggest activation of the inflammatory response, as both Fib and CRP are positive acute phase proteins. Elevated CRP, neutrophilic leucocytosis and increases in cytokine IL- 6 and IL- 8 has been documented in four human patients bitten by Bothrops and Crotalus snakes (two each) in Brazil. CRP levels were low immediately post-envenoming, peaked at two days post-envenoming and dropped to within normal limits four days post-envenoming. These findings demonstrated a typical acute-phase response and it is likely that a similar acute phase response occurred after puffadder and cobra envenoming in our study. Mean antithrombin (AT) activity was mildly decreased in both the puffadder- and cobra-envenomed dogs compared to the controls (P= 0. 002 and 0. 004, respectively), suggesting that the activation of haemostasis led to some AT consumption. Mean PT and mean aPTT were prolonged in the cobra-envenomed dogs compared to the controls (P= 0. 03 for both), but were within their reference intervals (RI). At 24 hours post envenomation mean haematocrit (Ht) was significantly decreased in the puffadder group compared to the cobra group (P= 0. 01), but was within RI. The Ht was significantly lower at 24 hours post envenomation compared to presentation values in both these groups (P< 0. 001 and 0. 02, respectively). At presentation, marked thrombocytopenia, leucocytosis and prolonged clot initiation were common features in puffadder-envenomed dogs and were likely venom-induced. Snouted cobra-envenomed dogs were normo- to hypercoagulable at presentation. Both puffadder- and cobra-envenomed dogs equally showed hypercoagulability at 24 hours post-envenomation and this was more pronounced compared to their coagulability at presentation. TEG proved to be a useful tool to detect abnormal haemostasis in all envenomed dogs in this study. TEG also provided additional insights into certain aspects of snake envenomation (such as hypercoagulability) that has not been reported on previously and cannot be assessed using traditional coagulation assays. TEG may serve as a differentiating tool in early envenomation between these two types of snake envenoming in scenarios where the identity of the snake species involved is not known.
