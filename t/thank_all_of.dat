500|$|We {{have been}} working {{together}} as Destiny's Child since we were 9, and touring together since we were 14. After {{a lot of discussion}} and some deep soul searching, we realized that our current tour has given us the opportunity to leave Destiny's Child on a high note, united in our friendship and filled with an overwhelming gratitude for our music, our fans, and each other. After all these wonderful years working together, we realized that {{now is the time to}} pursue our personal goals and solo efforts in earnest...No matter what happens, we will always love each other as friends and sisters and will always support each other as artists. We want to <b>thank</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> our fans for their incredible love and support and hope to see you all again as we continue fulfilling our destinies. —Destiny's Child, MTV ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2008, reports {{speculated that}} Knight {{requested}} {{to be released}} from his contract and that [...] "they were working out the details" [...] at that time. In June 2009, after the conclusion of the fifth season of Grey's Anatomy, it was confirmed that Knight would not be returning for the show's sixth season. The actor stated the reason for his departure was due to a [...] "breakdown in communication" [...] with Rhimes, O'Malley's lack of screen time, as well as his decision to be openly gay. Prior to the official announcement of his departure, there was speculation that the role of O'Malley would be recast, but Rhimes labeled it as a [...] "hilarious, ridiculous rumor". After the confirmation of his exit, Knight told TV Guide: [...] "Leaving Grey's Anatomy was not an easy decision for me to make. I am extremely grateful to {{have had the opportunity to}} play this character and will miss my fellow cast and crew very much. I continue to wish them the very best, and wholeheartedly <b>thank</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the fans who have supported me and the show with such passion and enthusiasm." [...] In a statement confirming Knight's departure, Rhimes said: [...] "I think I speak for the entire Grey's Anatomy family when I say we wish T.R. Knight the best in his future endeavors. He is an incredibly talented actor and a person whose strength of character is admired by all of us." ...|$|E

[...] "Your compassion is helping us greatly to overcome these difficult times, and it shows us there also are good and honest people here who really care for us.

2500|$|In 1991, Mac {{formed a}} side-project, Itch-E and Scratch-E, with fellow Sydney-based electronica artist, Andy Rantzen of the group, Pelican Daughters. Both {{provided}} keyboards and samplers. Itch-E and Scratch-E became their main focus {{with the success}} of their debut album, Itch-E Kitch-E Koo (1993), and its related single, [...] "Sweetness and Light" [...] (1994). At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995 the single won Best Dance Release. During his acceptance speech Mac controversially declared, [...] "We'd like to <b>thank</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Sydney's ecstasy dealers, without whom this award would not be possible". One of the sponsors of the ceremony was the National Drug Offensive, which withdrew their support. In 2005, Mac explained that he did not expect to win and so had not prepared a speech. The group often includes Sherriff Lindo for live performances. From 1996 to 1998, Mac and Rantzen also performed as Boo Boo and Mace!, and with Lindo aboard they worked as Boo Boo Mace 'n' Nutcase.|$|E
2500|$|Fahima Haque of The Washington Post, Bim Adewunmi of The Guardian, and Christopher Rosen of The Huffington Post all {{reiterate}} {{the fact}} that Rue and Thresh are described in The Hunger Games as having dark brown skin, as well as Collins's assertion that they were intended to be depicted as African Americans. Adewunmi remarked that [...] "it comes to this: if the casting of Rue, Thresh and Cinna has left you bewildered and upset, consider two things. One: {{you may be a}} racist—congrats! Two: you definitely lack basic reading comprehension. Mazel tov!" [...] Erik Kain of Forbes saw the controversy as a way to appreciate the value of free speech. He states that while society may never be free of racism, [...] "racist comments made on Facebook and Twitter quickly become public record. Aggregations of these comments, like the Jezebel piece, expose people for what they are. Sure, many hide under the cloak of anonymity, but many others cannot or choose not to. And as the internet becomes more civilized and its denizens more accountable, this sort of thing carries more and more weight." [...] Amandla Stenberg responded to the controversy with the following statement: [...] "As a fan of the books, I feel fortunate to be part of The Hunger Games family... It was an amazing experience; I am proud of the film and my performance. I want to <b>thank</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> my fans and the entire Hunger Games community for their support and loyalty." [...] Dayo Okeniyi was quoted saying [...] "I think this is a lesson for people to think before they tweet" [...] and [...] "It's sad... We could now see where society is today. But I {{try not to think about}} stuff like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{band was}} {{inducted}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 14, 2012 by actor/comedian Chris Rock, who is a longtime friend and fan of the band. The induction lineup was Kiedis, Flea, Smith, Klinghoffer, Frusciante, Slovak (who was represented by his brother James), Irons and Martinez. Frusciante did not attend the ceremony. Smith said [...] "We asked him, he said, 'I'm just not really comfortable with that, but good luck and thanks for inviting me.' He's the kind of guy, I think, that once he's finished with something he's just on to the next phase of his life. The Chili Peppers are not really on his radar right now." [...] Despite recording one album with the band, Dave Navarro and Jack Sherman were the only two former recording band members not inducted. Kiedis explained that Navarro, who appeared to be fine with not being included, was better suited for induction as a member of Jane's Addiction, the band he was best known for. Sherman on the other hand was angry about not being included and spoke out about the band's induction blaming the band for not including him or Navarro by saying he was told only original members, current members and those who played on multiple albums were eligible for induction (although this has proven to not be the case with other inductees). [...] "It appeared to be a politically correct way of omitting Dave Navarro and I for whatever reasons they have that are probably the band's and not the Hall's," [...] Sherman also said [...] "It's really painful to see all this celebrating going on and be excluded. I'm not claiming that I've brought anything other to the band... but to have soldiered on under arduous conditions {{to try to make the}} thing work, and I think that's what you do in a job, looking back. And that's been dishonored. I'm being dishonored, and it sucks." [...] During his induction speech, Smith made sure to <b>thank</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the band members, past and present including Sherman, Navarro along D. H. Peligro (whom he accidentally called H.R. Peligro) and Arik Marshall for the contributions they brought to the band. At 32, Klinghoffer was the youngest artist ever to be inducted into the hall of fame passing Stevie Wonder, who was 38 at the time of his induction. The band performed three songs, including [...] "By the Way", [...] "Give it Away" [...] and [...] "Higher Ground", which included Irons and Martinez on drums. It was the first time Kiedis and Flea had performed with Irons in 24 years and Martinez in 26 years. Near the end of the ceremony, the band was joined by George Clinton, Michael Hampton, Slash, Billie Joe Armstrong, Tre Cool, Ronnie Wood and Kenney Jones for a performance of [...] "Higher Ground".|$|E
