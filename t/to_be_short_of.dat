500|$|As {{part of an}} {{operation}} codenamed [...] "Drake", the 2/12th Infantry Battalion, a Second Australian Imperial Force unit from the 18th Infantry Brigade, which was composed mainly of men from Queensland and Tasmania, was selected to invade Goodenough Island, having taken part in the fighting around Milne Bay in August and September. Its commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Arnold, as the commander of Drake Force, was ordered to destroy the Japanese force there, re-establish the coastwatching and radar warning posts, and reconnoitre the island for airfield sites. Intelligence reports indicated that there were approximately 300 Japanese troops on the island, mainly concentrated in the Galaiwau Bay–Kilia Mission area in the south-east. The Japanese were believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>short</b> <b>of</b> food and ammunition, and suffering from malnutrition and disease.|$|E
500|$|Smoking {{cigarettes}} {{has become}} synonymous with Dot, and Brown {{has suggested that the}} habit is [...] "intrinsic" [...] to the character. Following the 2007 England smoking ban, it was reported in the Daily Mail that the BBC were refusing to prohibit the character from smoking on-screen despite the act being banned in workplaces, as they have [...] "to portray real life– and people smoke". Dot's smoking was criticised by private healthcare company Bupa in 2008, when they rated her television's most unhealthy character. They suggest that, in order to spread a public message, Dot should appear breathless, not with [...] "implausibly good health". They added, [...] "Though Dot Cotton has a smoker's voice– deeper than you might expect, she does not seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>short</b> <b>of</b> breath or wheezy" [...] and that viewers would be influenced by this. However, Dot's smoking has been described by broadcasting watchdogs Ofcom as [...] "justified {{in the context of the}} programme as a representation of an East End character" [...] and they therefore stipulate that enforcement of broadcast smoking-sanctions would be unlikely on EastEnders.|$|E

The results, which match those predicted by the non-supersymmetrical Standard Model rather than the predictions of many branches of supersymmetry, show the decays are less common than some forms of supersymmetry predict, though could still match the predictions of other versions of supersymmetry theory.
