5|$|Initially, {{surgeons}} recommended {{an eight-hour}} procedure {{to remove the}} tumours; however, their size and proximity <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> box eventually persuaded them to recommend radiotherapy, of which Boycott had 35 sessions from 22 October. By December, scans revealed {{that the majority of}} the tumours had disappeared, and the final tumour's disappearance was confirmed in early 2003. Although initially reluctant to discuss his health with the public, he spoke privately with his daughter, Emma, and then released a statement publicly, which evoked a significant emotional response. On 16 August 2003, he was given his own standing ovation by the crowd at Trent Bridge as he and a number of other cricketers did a lap of the ground in vehicles to celebrate Trent Bridge's 50th Test match.|$|E
25|$|Fiercely {{territorial}} as some Indios fans are, {{a common}} practice {{for many of them}} is to turn the volume down on television broadcasts featuring the Indios, and turning a radio set on to the official Indios radio broadcast, which is aired on station WYEL-AM (600kHz) and streamcasted over the Internet. Soto's vocal inflections are so well recognized by fans that by just listening <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> many can identify the difference between a pop-up fly and a hit before the ball actually lands.|$|E
25|$|Caruso biographers Pierre Key, Bruno Zirato and Stanley Jackson {{attribute}} Caruso's fame {{not only}} <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> and musicianship {{but also to}} a keen business sense and an enthusiastic embrace of commercial sound recording, then in its infancy. Many opera singers of Caruso's time rejected the phonograph (or gramophone) owing to the low fidelity of early discs. Others, including Adelina Patti, Francesco Tamagno and Nellie Melba, exploited the new technology once they {{became aware of the}} financial returns that Caruso was reaping from his initial recording sessions.|$|E

25|$|However, {{this did}} not affect RKO's plans for Astaire, first lending {{him for a few}} days to MGM in 1933 for his {{significant}} Hollywood debut, where he appeared as himself dancing with Joan Crawford in the successful musical film Dancing Lady. On his return to RKO, he got fifth billing after fourth billed Ginger Rogers in the 1933 Dolores del Río vehicle Flying Down to Rio. In a review, Variety magazine attributed its massive success to Astaire's presence:The main point of Flying Down to Rio is the screen promise of Fred Astaire... He's assuredly a bet after this one, for he's distinctly likable on the screen, the mike is kind <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> and as a dancer he remains in a class by himself. The latter observation will be no news to the profession, which has long admitted that Astaire starts dancing where the others stop hoofing.|$|E
500|$|Edward Asner {{was praised}} in several media outlets for his {{portrayal}} of Carl. San Francisco Chronicle editor Mick LaSalle praised Asner as a great choice due to having a grumpiness <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> that is not truly grumpy, but rather coming from a protective stance. Entertainment Weekly editor Lisa Schwarzbaum praised Asner's acting, stating {{that he has a}} [...] "Lou Grant authority" [...] <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E
500|$|According to Inagaki, Hiruma {{was created}} to be a [...] "devil-hero", or a kind of anti-hero. Due to this, Murata, the manga's illustrator, tried to give Hiruma a demonic appearance. In the OVA, {{released}} before the anime's start, he is voiced by Shin-ichiro Miki. However, in the 2005 Japanese anime television series, he was replaced by Atsushi Tamura, who was chosen by the manga series creators due <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> which they believed was perfect for the role. His voice actor in the English adaptation is Derek Stephen Prince. Hiruma has been well received by publications for manga and anime. Numerous pieces of merchandise in Hiruma's likeness have also been released, including decals and statues of ceramic and resin.|$|E

500|$|Robey {{made his}} {{television}} debut in August 1938 but was unenthused with the medium and only made rare appearances. [...] The BBC producer Grace Wyndham Goldie was dismayed at how little of his [...] "comic quality" [...] was conveyed {{on the small}} screen. Goldie thought that Robey's comic abilities were not limited <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> and depended largely on the relation between his facial expressions and his witty words. She felt that he should [...] "be forbidden, by his own angel, if nobody else, to approach the ordinary microphone". Nonetheless, Goldie remained optimistic about Robey's future television career. The journalist L. Marsland Gander disagreed and thought that Robey's methods were [...] "really too slow for television".|$|E
500|$|As {{tapes of}} Dylan's {{recordings}} circulated {{in the music}} industry, journalists became aware of their existence. In June 1968, Jann Wenner wrote a front-page Rolling Stone story headlined [...] "Dylan's Basement Tape Should Be Released". Wenner listened to the fourteen-song demo and reported, [...] "There is enough material—most all of it very good—to make an entirely new Bob Dylan album, a record with a distinct style of its own." [...] He concluded, [...] "Even though Dylan used {{one of the finest}} rock and roll bands ever assembled on the Highway 61 album, here he works with his own band for the first time. Dylan brings that instinctual feel for rock and roll <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> for the first time. If this were ever to be released it would be a classic." ...|$|E
500|$|For Tracy Draco, the {{producers}} wanted an established actress opposite [...] Lazenby. Brigitte Bardot was invited, but after she signed {{to appear in}} Shalako opposite Sean Connery the deal fell through, and Diana Rigg—who had already been the popular heroine Emma Peel in The Avengers—was cast instead. Rigg {{said one of the}} reasons for accepting the role was that she always wanted to be in an epic film. Telly Savalas was cast following a suggestion from Broccoli, and Hunt's neighbour George Baker was offered the part of Sir Hilary Bray. Baker's voice was also used when Lazenby was impersonating Bray, as Hunt considered Lazenby's imitation not convincing enough. Gabriele Ferzetti was cast as Draco after {{the producers}} saw him in an Italian Mafia film, but Ferzetti's heavy Italian accent also led <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> being redubbed by English actor David de Keyser for the final cut.|$|E

500|$|Grohl and Jones {{produced}} the record across {{a period of}} one week in October 1994, with Grohl on vocals and all instruments. Both would arrive {{in the morning at}} Robert Lang Studios, start production by noon and do four songs a day. According to Grohl, during the recording process he would run from room to room, [...] "still sweating and shaking from playing drums and [...] pick up the guitar and put down a track, do the bass, maybe another guitar part, have a sip of coffee and then go in and do the next song". The only performance by an outsider was a guitar part on [...] "X-Static" [...] provided by Greg Dulli of The Afghan Whigs, who was watching Grohl record the songs. Grohl eventually asked him if he wanted to play and handed him a guitar. Each song took about 45 minutes to be completed, and the compositions were recorded in the same order that became the album's track listing. The only song that required two run-throughs before completion was [...] "I'll Stick Around". Grohl was insecure about his singing, and added effects <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> in [...] "Floaty", and tried to enhance the performance through double track – [...] "You know how people double their vocals to make them stronger? That album the vocals are quadrupled." ...|$|E
500|$|Bieber premiered an {{acoustic}} {{version of the}} song on MuchMusic. He sang the song on VH1's Pepsi Super Bowl Fan Jam, along with other performers Rihanna, JoJo and Timbaland, and on CBS' The Early Show {{as a part of}} their Super Bowl programming. He performed the song the first time with Ludacris on BET's SOS: Saving Ourselves – Help for Haiti Telethon, on February 6, 2009, which also aired on VH1, and MTV. During the chorus, he changed the lyrics to [...] "Baby, baby, Haiti", to show support for the cause, and the reason everyone came together for the show. In the week of his album release, he performed the song on The View and 106 & Park. Bieber also performed the song at the 2010 Kids Choice Awards on March 27. Bieber performed the song along with [...] "U Smile" [...] on the eighteenth episode of season thirty five of Saturday Night Live. Bieber performed {{an acoustic}} rendition of the song along with a freestyle by good friend Drake at the 2010 Juno Awards. In April 2010, Bieber noted that due <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> changing, he could no longer hit all the notes in [...] "Baby", and for live performances, the key is lowered. Bieber performed the song live in Sydney, Australia on April 26, 2010, in the Sunrise studios after his public performance was cancelled. Bieber also performed the song on May 11, 2010, on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Bieber performed the song on June 4, 2010, on the Today Show along with [...] "Never Say Never", [...] "Somebody to Love", and [...] "One Time". He performed the song with [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] at the 2010 MuchMusic Video Awards.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main source}} of Bain's {{publicity}} is his primary YouTube channel, where he posts {{what he describes as}} [...] "variety gaming content" [...] as part of the YouTube gaming network Polaris.

He has been described by Will Porter of Eurogamer as a [...] "champion of indie gaming" [...] and YouTube's foremost [...] "love him or hate him" [...] personality.

2500|$|Throughout his career, Blanc, {{aware of}} his talents, {{protected}} the rights <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> characterizations contractually and legally. He, and later his estate, never hesitated taking civil action when those rights were violated. Voice actors at the time rarely received screen credits, but Blanc was an exception; by 1944, his contract with Warner Bros. stipulated a credit reading [...] "Voice characterization(s) by Mel Blanc." [...] According to his autobiography, Blanc asked for and received this screen credit from studio boss Leon Schlesinger after he was denied a salary raise. Initially, Blanc's screen credit was limited only to cartoons where he voiced Bugs Bunny, with any other shorts he worked on being uncredited. In the middle of 1945, the contract was amended to include a screen credit for cartoons featuring Porky Pig and/or Daffy Duck as well, save for any shorts made before that amendment occurred (Book Revue and Baby Bottleneck are examples, despite being released after the fact). But {{by the end of}} 1946, Blanc began receiving a screen credit in any subsequent Warner Bros. cartoon he provided voices from that point on.|$|E

2500|$|Miller's own {{description}} of his high tenor vocals as a [...] "miserable whine" [...] or [...] "my usual obnoxious vocals" [...] was sometimes repeated by reviewers of his work in Game Theory, who often added balancing comments, such as [...] "while he's fond of referring <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> as a 'miserable whine,' he sure {{knows how to make}} it communicate." [...] In many reviews, Miller's self-deprecation was outweighed by critical praise for his talents in vocal phrasing, inventiveness, and musical ambition. Stephin Merritt cited Miller's [...] "swooping melodies, large vocabulary lyrics dense with idiom and metaphor," [...] and [...] "gloriously catchy hooks." [...] According to Pitchfork writer Matt LeMay, Miller [...] "had a singular way of making unexpected and counterintuitive chord changes sound downright inevitable." [...] Music journalist Kent Williams added, [...] "What marks Miller's songs as unique is his obsession with coming up with a perfect, and perfectly new chord progression. Like his hero Alex Chilton, he had a fondness for accessible pop music that had lots of moving parts under the hood. Lyrically, he was both class clown and over-achiever. He wanted words as devious and pretty as the best lyrics of Stephen Sondheim and Jerry Leiber, but shot through with almost Joycean obscurity and puckish humor." ...|$|E
2500|$|He also {{performed}} in the 2007 WOMAD (World of Music, Arts and Dance) festival concert, and in reviewing his performance BBC Radio referred <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> as [...] "sensational". D'Or described an experience that he had singing at the festival as follows: [...] "I had a concert in the Canary Islands...in the WOMAD Festival in front of something like 20,000 people, and then I saw {{just in front of}} me, a group of Palestinian young people with a huge Palestinian flag. And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't know what their intentions were. I closed my eyes and said 'Look, you speak always about the power of music and how music can get people close to each other', and I was like aiming to their heart, and I'm singing especially for them, and then when I opened my eyes and I saw those people dancing with the Palestinian flag and singing with me together, and it was for me like an amazing sight, because this is something that I don't think ever happened before. I don't know why this world...is choosing...always...war and hate, because things are much easier to solve if you just want to solve them, that's what I feel. And maybe it's naïve, but this is my belief." ...|$|E
2500|$|Their third album, Desolation Boulevard, was {{released}} later in 1974, {{six months after}} Sweet Fanny Adams. By that stage, producer Phil Wainman had moved on and the album was produced by Mike Chapman. It was recorded in a mere six days and featured a rawer [...] "live" [...] sound. One track, The Man With The Golden Arm, written by Elmer Bernstein and Sylvia Fine for the 1955 Frank Sinatra movie of the same name, featured drummer Mick Tucker performing an 8 and half minute solo (although this {{was not included in}} the U.S. release). This had been a staple of the band's live performance for years. The first single from the LP, the heavy-melodic [...] "The Six Teens" [...] (July 1974), was a Top 10 hit in the U.K. and still part of the amazing unbroken string of #1's in Denmark. However, the subsequent single release, [...] "Turn It Down" [...] (November 1974), reached only number 41 on the U.K. chart and #2 in Denmark. [...] "Turn It Down" [...] received minimal airplay on UK radio and was banned by some radio stations because of certain lyrical content - [...] "God-awful sound" [...] and [...] "For God sakes, turn it down" [...] - which were deemed [...] "unsuitable for family listening." [...] The band resumed playing live shows nearly a full six months after Connolly's throat injury, with band and critics noting a rougher edge <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> and a reduced range. The album also featured a group composition, [...] "Fox On The Run", which was to be re-recorded months later.|$|E
