An extreme example is the alien species, the Vulcans, who had a violent past but learned to control their emotions. Roddenberry also gave Star Trek an anti-war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal, optimistic version of the United Nations. His efforts were opposed by the network because of concerns over marketability, e.g., they opposed Roddenberry's insistence that Enterprise have a racially diverse crew.|$|E

Christians grew to become the largest religious group in the city by the late 18th century.

In Nazareth, the Christian community prospered and grew under Zahir's rule, and saw an influx from the Maronite and Greek Orthodox communities of Lebanon and Transjordan, respectively. The Melkite patriarch lived in Acre between 1765 and 1768. Along with the Jews, the Christians contributed to the economy of Zahir's sheikhdom in a number of ways, including the relative ease with which they were able to deal with European merchants, <b>the</b> <b>networks</b> of support many of them maintained in Damascus or Istanbul, and their role in service industries.|$|E

In 2005, C-SPAN covered Hurricane Katrina through NBC affiliate WDSU in New Orleans, as well as coverage of Hurricane Ike via CBS affiliate KHOU in Houston. C-SPAN also carries CBC coverage during events that affect Canadians, such as the Canadian federal elections, the death and state funeral of Pierre Trudeau, and the 2003 North America blackout. During early 2011, C-SPAN carried broadcasts by Al Jazeera to cover the events in Egypt, Tunisia, and other Arab nations.

40|$|The Multi-BAM {{associative}} {{neural network}} is proposed in this paper, {{which is an}} extension of the Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM). Instead of only two units, as in the BAM, the Multi-BAM consists of many units. It operates in an iterative way like that of the relaxation process. The energy of <b>the</b> <b>network</b> is also defined, and is proven to converge during the iterative process of <b>the</b> <b>network.</b> Based on <b>the</b> property that the energy of <b>the</b> <b>network</b> will reach its local minimum when all the units in <b>the</b> <b>network</b> are correct, we have derived the sufficient conditions that <b>the</b> <b>network</b> must meet in order that <b>the</b> <b>network,</b> when errors exist in its units, will be able to reach the correct recalls during iteration. Some experimental simulations have been done to investigate <b>the</b> <b>network's</b> performance under various error conditions. These experiments have also compared the effects of <b>the</b> <b>network</b> sizes and positions of the erroneous units in <b>the</b> <b>network</b> on <b>the</b> <b>network</b> performance. 在本篇論文中，我們提出了多元雙向聯想記憶綱路（Multi-BAM）的架構，它是由雙向聯想記憶網路擴大為具有多個單元的網路，其運作方式是與鬆弛法類似的疊代過程。我們也定義了網路的能量，並且證明了在疊代的過程中，Multi-BAM網路最後會收斂的結論。我們並利用網路總能量在所有單元完全正確時會達到能量局部最小值的特性，推導出當綱路中有單元發生錯誤時，網路經過疊代後可達到正確聯想時所必須滿足的充分條件。我們也用了幾個實驗模擬的例子來探討網路單元在發生了各種錯誤的情況下，綱路聯想的結果，也比較了綱路的大小及錯誤單元在網路中的位置對聯想結果之影響...|$|R
