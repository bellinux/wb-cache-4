5|$|After the {{previous}} depot was destroyed, the Central Vermont Railroad (which then leased the New London Northern) began making {{plans for a}} larger replacement station. The Central Vermont and the New Haven Railroad (which had bought the Shore Line in 1870) bought {{the east end of}} the Parade from New London for the unusually low price of $15,000, with the understanding that the railroads would build a structure more suitable for <b>the</b> <b>bustling</b> city.|$|E
5|$|In October 1889, a {{subsidiary}} of the Wisconsin Central Railroad began constructing a new passenger terminal at the southwest corner of Harrison and Wells Streets (then called Fifth Avenue) in Chicago, to replace a nearby temporary facility. The location of this new depot, along the south branch of the Chicago River, was selected to take advantage of <b>the</b> <b>bustling</b> passenger and freight market traveling on nearby Lake Michigan.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} castle was 'tending to ruin', and {{following}} his {{victory in the}} English Civil War Oliver Cromwell decreed its destruction in 1655, a process which was completed within a fortnight. The castle had stood on the main route from Bristol to London, and following its destruction a commercial avenue opened along Castle Street from the mediaeval city towards Old Market. The demolition of Lawford's Gate at {{the eastern end of}} Old Market Street extended this into West Street, creating an uninterrupted route into <b>the</b> <b>bustling</b> heart of Bristol.|$|E
5000|$|One {{point of}} {{interest}} about the fitting of <b>the</b> <b>bustle</b> came about as it was being installed. A crane was used to lift <b>the</b> <b>bustle</b> for <b>the</b> installation process. Unfortunately, the crane chosen was not of sufficient size to handle the extreme weight of <b>the</b> <b>bustle,</b> so that when it was lifted, the weight of <b>the</b> <b>bustle</b> was just too much. <b>The</b> <b>bustle</b> went into <b>the</b> water, and the crane was pulled onto its side. Two people were pinned under the crane until another crane, on a barge, could be brought in to lift <b>the</b> <b>bustle</b> out of <b>the</b> water, and right the other crane.|$|R
50|$|A {{tool storage}} box was {{normally}} mounted externally {{on the rear}} of <b>the</b> <b>bustle,</b> and three smoke grenade launchers were mounted {{on each side of}} the turret. Two large radio antenna were also attached to the rear of <b>the</b> <b>bustle.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bustle</b> later {{developed}} into a feature of fashion on its own after the overskirt of the late 1860s was draped up toward the back {{and some kind of}} support was needed for the new draped shape. Fullness of some sort was still considered necessary to make the waist look smaller and <b>the</b> <b>bustle</b> eventually replaced <b>the</b> crinoline completely. <b>The</b> <b>bustle</b> was worn in different shapes for most of the 1870s and 1880s, with a short period of non-bustled, flat-backed dresses from 1878 to 1882.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 2006, he set {{up several}} {{publishing}} companies that focused on Chinese politics. He joined the Chinese chapter of PEN International, through which he became acquainted with professionals in Hong Kong International PEN. In 2013, Gui, Lee Bo, and Lui Bo set up Mighty Current Media (also referred to as Sage Communications), a Hong Kong company specialising in publishing and distributing books on political gossip about leaders in China. Gui and Lee Bo both hold 34% of the company's shares (Lee Bo's shares are {{in the name of}} his wife, Sophie Choi), and Lui Bo holds the remaining 32%. In 2014, the company acquired Causeway Bay Books, an upstairs bookstore in <b>the</b> <b>bustling</b> part of Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|In 1797 Albany was {{declared}} the official {{capital of the}} state and the Legislature made city hall its home until the first state capitol was opened in 1809. In an effort to move public buildings away from <b>the</b> <b>bustling</b> and expanding waterfront, the new capitol was located atop the State Street hill, on the same land the current building now stands. City surveyor Simeon De Witt, in his , set aside this land as a public square. Also included on this map are depictions of city hall and the new city jail, located at State and Eagle Streets. In 1809, Albany city government moved with the Legislature into the new capitol and remained there until a new city hall was opened in 1832. The old Stadt Huys was eventually demolished after a fire in 1836.|$|E
5|$|Once {{out of the}} village, NY17A and NY94 {{begin to}} climb again, this time {{offering}} some panoramic views to the north, {{all the way to}} the Shawangunk Ridge and even the Catskill Mountains beyond them in clear enough weather. The road is surprisingly little developed in this area, with only one gas station between Florida and Warwick, its next stop, which likewise presents itself after a descent. Again, NY17A and NY94 serve as <b>the</b> <b>bustling</b> village's main street, longer this time and with many upscale boutiques in evidence. Many historic buildings line the road through Warwick. Near the southern end of the village, the two roads split, with NY94 continuing toward New Jersey while NY17A goes eastward.|$|E

25|$|By 1910, the {{overwhelming}} {{number of people in}} the city were Americans creating a settled environment. However, this period was short lived as the Mexican Revolution greatly impacted the city, bringing an influx of refugees – and capital – to <b>the</b> <b>bustling</b> boom town. Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bustle</b> then survived {{into the}} 1890s and early 20th {{century as a}} skirt support was still needed and the stylish shape {{dictated}} a curve {{in the back of}} the skirt to balance the curve of the bust in front. <b>The</b> <b>bustle</b> had completely disappeared by 1905, as the long corset of the early 20th century was now successful in shaping the body to protrude behind.|$|R

25|$|During its 29-year working life, the Davis Mine pumped {{thousands}} of tax {{dollars into the}} town’s coffers, and became a local tourist attraction as well. Visitors could climb an observation tower above the main shaft for {{a panoramic view of}} <b>the</b> <b>bustling</b> operation, which featured on-site blacksmith and butcher shops, a steady traffic of horse-drawn ore and coal wagons and the town’s first electric lighting. The annual payroll amounted to $100,000, and local farmers made extra income supplying the mine with timber and firewood, while selling fruit, vegetables and dairy products to the workers.|$|E
25|$|The railway {{first came}} to Berlin in 1838, {{with the opening of}} the Potsdamer Bahnhof, {{terminus}} of a 26km line linking the city with Potsdam, opened throughout by 29 October (in 1848 the line would be extended to Magdeburg and beyond). Since the city authorities would not allow the new line to breach the customs wall, still standing at the time, it had to stop just short, at Potsdamer Platz, but it was this that kick-started the real transformation of the area, into <b>the</b> <b>bustling</b> focal point that Potsdamer Platz would eventually become.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} stages of the fashion for <b>the</b> <b>bustle,</b> <b>the</b> {{fullness}} to the back of the skirts was carried quite low and often fanned out to create a train. The transition from the voluminous crinoline enhanced skirts of the 1850s and 1860s can be seen in the loops and gathers of fabric and trimmings worn during this period. <b>The</b> <b>bustle</b> later evolved into a much more pronounced humped shape on the back of the skirt immediately below the waist, with the fabric of the skirts falling quite sharply to the floor, changing the shape of the silhouette.|$|R

25|$|In October 2014, Bob the Builder was revamped by Mattel for a {{new series}} to be aired on Channel 5's Milkshake! in 2015.
