When Kyle drops his toy, Amy {{picks it up and}} tries to give it back but Joanie doesn't hear her so she keeps it. Amy returns the next day and a barmaid gives her Joanie's address. Amy plans to return the toy but changes her mind and leaves. Needing to see Kyle, she persuades Andy to let her take baby Jack to Kyle's playgroup and makes friends with Joanie, telling her that she is {{studying}} childcare and asking if she needs any help with Kyle. Joanie accepts and allows Amy to look after Kyle occasionally. Val is thrilled when she finds out but Victoria and Eric think it is a bad idea and Eric tells Joanie that Amy is Kyle's birth mother. Disgusted, Joanie refuses to let Amy see Kyle again but is eventually persuaded to change her mind. Sadly, while Amy and Kyle are on a picnic together, Kyle almost drowns and Joanie blames Amy. She promptly bans her from seeing Kyle and refuses to even consider changing her mind, even calling the police when Amy visits repeatedly, who warn her to stay away. Desperate to see her son, Amy and Andy (who she is now dating) call Social Services to see if she can get custody but <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> tells her that being awarded custody is very unlikely. Feeling now that the adoption was a mistake, Amy decides to snatch Kyle and go on the run. Kerry, understanding how Amy feels, tries to talk her out of it but when she can't, decides to help her. They go to Kyle's playgroup and kidnap him and Kerry drives them to the docks. During the drive, Val phones repeatedly but they don't answer. Eventually Kerry answers and Amy tearfully reveals her plans before throwing the phone away. Eric checks the computer's internet history and finds out where Amy is going. Cain, Andy, Val, Eric and Joanie all rush to the docks. In the end, Cain persuades Amy to return Kyle, warning her of the complications of the life on the run and how Kyle might be affected. She says goodbye to Kyle and gives him to Cain but fearing she'll be sent to prison, Amy leaves, devastating Val. Val later gets a call from Amy and learns that she is living in Ireland with her aunt.|$|E

The theories used in this study are Howard Becker’s labeling theory and equifinality and multifinality, which derive from the systems theory.   The result of the study was that <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> do not identify ADHD among their patients, but they adjust the treatment after what needs the individual patient have. These needs are for instance need of security and predictability. These needs are being considered in the treatment in the daily work since <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> use a treatment that consists of structure, routines and schedules. This treatment is used on every patient and is not adjusted whether a diagnosis exists or not. How <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> meet <b>the</b> patients can however be different for patients with ADHD since <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> find clearness, alliance and trust as important in the meeting with these patients.

25|$|The {{main part}} of the game is to lead a Sim from the start of life to death. A Sim will be born when a female Sim and a male Sim try for a baby. The mother will spend 3 Sim days (each day lasts 24 minutes though time can be sped-up) {{pregnant}} before giving birth to a baby. Players can name the new Sim upon birth. The baby's appearance and personality will be based on the genetics of its parents (though the baby's appearance is hidden until it becomes a toddler). Babies can also be adopted by calling <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> on the phone, even by single parents or same-gender couples. The baby will change into a toddler in 3 days, and 4 more days for the toddler to change into a child.

In 2011 the law, by which biological parents earlier had legal rights to have contact with the children and vice versa, was changed.

In this project we conclude that among <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> there are a high level of interpretation of <b>the</b> law. <b>The</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> use their judgement to interpret the law, when they decide how much the children should be involved.
