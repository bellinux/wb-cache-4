There {{was no difference in}} the McGurk effect when the listener was focusing anywhere on the speaker's face. The effect does not appear if the listener focuses beyond the speaker's face. In order for the McGurk effect to become insignificant, the listener's gaze must deviate from the speaker's mouth by at least 60 degrees.|$|E
25|$|Some {{forms of}} neglect {{may also be}} very mild—for example, in a {{condition}} called extinction where competition from the ipsilesional stimulus impedes perception of the contralesional stimulus. These patients, when asked <b>to</b> <b>fixate</b> on the examiner's nose, can detect fingers being wiggled on the affected side. If the examiner were to wiggle his or her fingers on both the affected and unaffected sides of the patient, the patient will report seeing movement only on the ipsilesional side.|$|E
25|$|Another {{advantage}} of PCI over ultrasound biometry {{is that the}} axial length measurement is performed through the visual axis since the patient is asked <b>to</b> <b>fixate</b> into the laser spot. In highly myopic or staphylomatous eyes, this can be particularly advantageous since it can sometimes be difficult to measure the true axial length through the visual axis with an ultrasound probe. PCI is also superior to ultrasound in the measurement of pseudophakic and silicone oil-filled eyes. For optical biometry, {{it is not as}} critical how the media change because the correction factor that must be applied is much smaller than in ultrasound biometry. It {{should be noted that the}} axial length obtained from PCI may be slightly longer than that obtained from ultrasound. This is due to PCI measuring the distance from the corneal surface to the RPE while ultrasound measures to the anterior retinal surface. Therefore, many IOL measurement machines require refined IOL constants unique to their mechanism.|$|E

Eye tracking was used to record pedestrians' visual fixations when walking outdoors in daytime and after dark with a concurrent dual task to better understand which fixations were critical. Fixations at critical instances, these being shown by slow reactions to the secondary task, were categorised into one of eight groups.

Homosexual interpretations of Batman {{and the original}} Robin, Dick Grayson, have been of interest in cultural and academic study, due primarily to psychologist Fredric Wertham's Seduction of the Innocent (1954). In the mid-1950s, Wertham led a national campaign against comic books, convincing Americans that they were responsible for corrupting children and encouraging them to engage in acts of sex and violence. In relation to Batman and Robin, Wertham asserted [...] "the Batman type of story helps <b>to</b> <b>fixate</b> homoerotic tendencies by suggesting {{the form of an}} adolescent-with-adult or Ganymede-Zeus type of love-relationship".|$|E

2500|$|Irwin's early {{experiments}} tested participants {{ability to}} identify random dot patterns as the same, or as different across saccades. The control condition for this experiment presented dot patterns in the same spatial location without saccades, meaning participants had a single fixation point. [...] A no-overlap control condition presented dot patterns in different spatial locations, while participants maintained fixation on one point. This tested the ability of visual short-term memory in identifying two individual patterns. The experimental condition showed dot patterns in the same spatial location but were viewed at separate fixations, forcing the use of transsaccadic memory. For the experimental condition, participants underwent a calibration phase, where they were shown five points in separate location <b>to</b> <b>fixate</b> on individually, for less than two seconds. The next phase presented a single fixation point for less than two seconds, which {{was followed by a}} random dot pattern presented in a different location, acting as a saccade target. The dot pattern disappeared when the saccade was initiated. Another dot pattern then appeared in the same location. Participants had to identify whether the two patterns were the same or different.|$|E
2500|$|Brent Herbert Leroy (Brent Butt) is {{the comic}} book-reading, sarcastic {{proprietor}} of Corner Gas. He {{is almost always}} good-natured, but has a tendency <b>to</b> <b>fixate</b> on minor details. He {{is a fan of}} adventure fiction such as The Saint in New York and The Executioner. His favourite food is chili cheese dogs, {{to the point where he}} can identify the individual ingredients by taste. Brent is 'adept' at many sports, such as curling, hockey and softball. His favourite football teams are the Saskatchewan Roughriders and Minnesota Vikings. He and Hank have been best friends since childhood, and Brent often makes fun of him and name multiple instances of Hank's stupidity. As of the Season 5 finale, Brent is 40 years old, and was born on November 6 (thus, his date of birth can be assumed to be November 6, 1967, since Brent graduated high school in 1986). Brent is said to be the hottest guy in Dog River, although other characters on the show acknowledge this is faint praise. He is also the Dog River Table Hockey Champion using a [...] "dump it into the corners" [...] style of play. It is implied that he and Lacey Burrows have feelings for each other, although neither will admit or act upon them. After the end of the series he went on to fulfill his dream of fly-fishing in the Yukon, while looking to wrestle a bear (he didn't find any bears, but he did see either a Sasquatch or an oddly shaped stump). It was revealed in [...] that he and Lacey entered into a romantic relationship three years after the end of the series.|$|E

However, the parafoveal preview effect on spaced compound words was larger than would be predicted {{on the basis of}} prior research. Experiment 2 examined whether this large effect was due to spaced compounds forming a larger linguistic unit by pairing spaced compounds with nonlexicalized adjective-noun pairs. There were no significant interactions between item type and parafoveal preview, suggesting that it is the syntactic predictability of the noun that is driving the large preview effect...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-This paper proposes {{reliable}} {{techniques for}} estimating density distribution (DD) of wind power on test-sites {{selected by the}} United Nations in Bangladesh. Wind power profile rule (with constant and variable power coefficients) and logarithmic law of wind shear are applied to seven unique methods used in forecasting wind power density achievable at commercial turbine-axle heights (30 - 120 m). The problems related <b>to</b> <b>fixating</b> the power law coefficient against environmental and geographic factors are identified while predicting wind profiles from low-altitude (~ 10 m) data. Relative deviations in forecasted density distribution are calculated to identify that, among the proposed methods, wind power rule with varying profile factors produce rates of inconsistency lower than 3 % and a logarithmic method produces rates falling below 12 % over a turbine range of 40 - 90 m. Projected wind profiles in Bangladesh achieve a maximum power-class level of four and a power density coverage of 30 - 400 Watt/m 2, sufficient for medium scale (above 20 kW) grid-supported wind projects...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a research project}} into undergraduates’ use of a software tool to learn symbolic logic—a complex abstract domain that {{has been shown to}} be intimidating for students. The software allows the students to manipulate proofs in certain ways and then calculates the consequences of their actions. A research method has been developed that allowed students’ use of this tool to be modelled, and this model was then used to identify, refine and create visual cues that provide support for students’ reasoning. The focus of this paper is the role of the software as an artefact to aid students’ visualisation of reasoning processes rather than the logic itself. The main mechanisms by which this visualisation is supported are the imposition of constraints on the actions available and the demonstration to students of the consequences of their actions. The study shows that the software encouraged experimentation with different routes to a proof, and constituted a challenge <b>to</b> <b>fixated</b> reasoning...|$|R
