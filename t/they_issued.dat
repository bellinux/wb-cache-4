5|$|The Flavians, {{although}} a relatively short-lived dynasty, helped restore stability to an empire on its knees. Although all three have been criticised, especially {{based on their}} more centralised style of rule, <b>they</b> <b>issued</b> reforms that created a stable enough empire to last well into the 3rd century. However, their background as a military dynasty led to further marginalisation of the senate, and a conclusive move away from princeps, or first citizen, and toward imperator, or emperor.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Weylandt's death, Giro {{officials}} {{announced that they}} would not issue his dossard number 108 in future editions of the race. His number was a prominent part of signs held by fans on the roadside at not just the Giro but other events later in the season as well, including the Tour of California where his death was part of the reason the first stage of that race was canceled due to safety concerns. Many other races, mostly those held in Weylandt's native Belgium, also began the practice of not issuing the number. The Belgian federation criticized this gesture, saying it would not bring Weylandt back and would only serve to continually remind fans and those in the sport of Weylandt's death. <b>They</b> <b>issued</b> the number for the Belgian national road race championships.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, Brendan Picchio joined Waikiki as a bassist, and Juanita switched to rhythm guitar. The group soon became dissatisfied with its material, so the members chose a new direction for their music. They wrote {{a number of new}} songs and made a wish list of producers with whom they would like to work. In 2004, the band changed its name to Howling Bells, as its members felt that phrase better embodied its newly adapted indie rock style.|$|E

5|$|Many women's {{rights activists}} {{who worked with}} Stanton were opposed to the {{publication}} of The Woman's Bible; they felt it would harm the drive for women's suffrage. Although it was never accepted by Bible scholars as a major work, it became a popular best-seller, much {{to the dismay of}} suffragists who worked alongside Stanton within the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Susan B. Anthony tried to calm the younger suffragists, but <b>they</b> <b>issued</b> a formal denunciation of the book, and worked to distance the suffrage movement from Stanton's broader scope which included attacks on traditional religion. Because of the widespread negative reaction, including that of suffragists who had been close to her, publication of the book effectively ended Stanton's influence in the suffrage movement.|$|E
5|$|The Irish Post Office {{has never}} publicised an {{official}} stamp numbering {{system for the}} postage stamps <b>they</b> <b>issued,</b> so collectors use a stamp numbering system {{from one of the}} most popular stamp catalogues, such as Stanley Gibbons, Scott, MacDonnell Whyte, MDW (last edition 1991), Hibernian or Michel. There are differences between these numbering systems that result in a varying sequence of stamps in each listing, with some stamps included on some lists but not on others—usually varieties that the publishers think do not belong in a general catalogue. For instance, Ireland's first postage stamp, the 2d Map of Ireland, issued in 1922 is numbered 68 by Scott, 43 by Michel, D4 by Hibernian and MacDonnell Whyte and 74 by Stanley Gibbons.|$|E

López made generous offers to American military leaders to support him, but Taylor and Clayton saw the enterprise as illegal. <b>They</b> <b>issued</b> a blockade, and later, authorized a mass arrest of López and his fellows, although the group would eventually be acquitted.

5|$|Yet while Solidarity {{was ready}} to take up {{negotiations}} with the government, the Polish communists were unsure what to do, as <b>they</b> <b>issued</b> empty declarations and bided their time. Against the background of a deteriorating communist shortage economy and unwillingness to negotiate seriously with Solidarity, it became increasingly clear that the Communist government would eventually have to suppress the Solidarity movement {{as the only way}} out of the impasse, or face a truly revolutionary situation. The atmosphere was increasingly tense, with various local chapters conducting a growing number of uncoordinated strikes as well as street protests, such as the Summer 1981 hunger demonstrations in Poland, in response to the worsening economic situation. On December 3, 1981, Solidarity announced that a 24-hour strike would be held if the government were granted additional powers to suppress dissent, and that a general strike would be declared if those powers were used.|$|E

5|$|Although still {{a minimal}} {{tropical}} storm at the time, the CPHC anticipated Neki {{to become a}} hurricane as it tracked northwestward. As such, <b>they</b> <b>issued</b> a hurricane watch for Johnston Island {{on the afternoon of}} October19. The following day, the hurricane watch was replaced by a tropical storm watch as Neki was no longer forecast to pass close enough to the island to produce hurricane-force winds. Later that day, a hurricane watch was issued for the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Lisianski Island. The following morning, a supplementary hurricane warning was issued for the monument for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa. Additionally, the tropical storm watch for Johnston Island was discontinued. Early on October22, the hurricane watch for Lisianski Island to Marco Reef was replaced by a tropical storm watch. Several hours later, the CPHC discontinued this watch. Early on October23, as Neki weakened to a tropical storm, the hurricane warning for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa was replaced by a tropical storm warning. The tropical storm warning remained in effect for more than a day before being canceled during the afternoon of October24.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold {{began the}} war as a captain in Connecticut's militia, a {{position}} {{to which he was}} elected in March 1775. His company marched northeast the following month to assist in the siege of Boston that followed the outbreak of hostilities at Lexington and Concord. Arnold proposed to the Massachusetts Committee of Safety an action to seize Fort Ticonderoga in New York, which he knew was poorly defended. <b>They</b> <b>issued</b> him a colonel's commission on May 3, 1775, and he immediately rode off to the west, arriving at Castleton in the disputed New Hampshire Grants (present-day Vermont) in time to participate with Ethan Allen and his men in the capture of Fort Ticonderoga. He followed up that action with a bold raid on Fort Saint-Jean on the Richelieu River north of Lake Champlain. A Connecticut militia force arrived at Ticonderoga in June; Arnold had a dispute with its commander over control of the fort, and resigned his Massachusetts commission. He was {{on his way home from}} Ticonderoga when he learned that his wife had died earlier in June.|$|E
5|$|Early in September 1990, Vietnamese Prime Minister Đỗ Mười, General Secretary Nguyen Van Linh {{and former}} Prime Minister Pham Van Dong {{travelled}} to Chengdu, China, where {{they held a}} secret meeting with Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng and General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Jiang Zemin. On 17 September 1990, General Võ Nguyên Giáp also made a trip to China and thanked the Chinese Government for its past assistance. Despite outward signs of improvement in Vietnam's diplomatic relations with China, Vietnamese leaders were reluctant to endorse any peace plan which could weaken their client regime in Phnom Penh. However, as the four Cambodian factions reached an agreement on the power-sharing arrangement outlined at the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting in February 1990, Vietnam and China rapidly moved to re-establish formal diplomatic relations. In November 1991, newly elected Vietnamese Prime Minister Võ Văn Kiệt travelled to Beijing and met his Chinese counterpart, Li Peng, and <b>they</b> <b>issued</b> an 11-point communiqué re-establishing diplomatic ties {{between the two countries}} after 10 years without formal relations.|$|E
