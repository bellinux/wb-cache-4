5|$|After {{reviving}} the Sacred Beasts, the hatred is purged, but the racial tensions remain. Veigue begins to have difficulty {{in dealing with}} Claire's condition, and his cold attitude causes her to leave with Milhaust. Eventually, Veigue opens up {{to the rest of}} the group and overcomes his difficulties. As the continuing negative feelings of Karegia's population are starting to damage the world, the group decide to revive Georgyas again and bring him round to their way of <b>thinking.</b> <b>At</b> Geyorkias' resting place, Zilva appears and reveals herself as the mastermind behind the incidents, declaring that she will use Geyorkias to destroy the Humas and create a Gajuma-ruled kingdom. After her defeat, the party revive Geyorkias: he in turn reveals that the force influencing Zilva and spreading hatred was in fact Yuris, and that Yuris has become a threat to the world. The group travel to confront Yuris, but are initially sapped of strength by its negative emotions. The growing positive emotions of the people of Karegia as the racial disputes fade give them the strength to destroy Yuris' core. Agarte then recovers her Force, returns herself and Claire to their original bodies, and summons the Sacred Beasts to destroy Yuris. The effort costs Agarte her life, and she leaves Karegia in Milhaust's charge and reveals her love for him before dying. The group then go their separate ways to resolve the remaining conflicts in the land.|$|E

25|$|The {{opening of}} the Cold War and fears of an attack by the Soviet Union led to {{increasing}} interest in Sweden possessing its own nuclear arsenal. They were only interested in tactical nuclear weapons {{that would be used}} in a defensive role on Swedish territory or nearby seas. For reasons not directly related to security, Sweden never considered strategic nuclear weapons that could reach the Soviet Union.

The SEATO treaty, signed only three years later, clearly demonstrated Australia’s position as a US ally in the emerging cold war.

25|$|Cuvier is also {{remembered for}} {{strongly}} opposing theories of evolution, {{which at the}} time (before Darwin's theory) were mainly proposed by Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. Cuvier believed there was no evidence for evolution, but rather evidence for cyclical creations and destructions of life forms by global extinction events such as deluges. In 1830, Cuvier and Geoffroy engaged in a famous debate, which is said to exemplify the two major deviations in biological <b>thinking</b> <b>at</b> the time – whether animal structure was due to function or (evolutionary) morphology. Cuvier supported function and rejected Lamarck's thinking.|$|E
25|$|According to diplomat Alan Renouf, the {{dominant}} theme in Australia's foreign policy under Australia's Liberal – Country Party {{governments of the}} 1950s and 1960s was anti-communism. Another former diplomat, Gregory Clark, suggested that it was specifically a fear of China that drove Australian foreign policy decisions for twenty years.

25|$|But Paley, {{according}} to CBS historian Robert Metz, {{also learned that}} Benny chafed under NBC's almost indifferent attitude toward the talent that attracted the listeners. NBC, {{under the leadership of}} David Sarnoff, seemed at the time to think that listeners were listening to NBC because of NBC itself. To Paley, {{according to}} Metz, that was foolish <b>thinking</b> <b>at</b> best: Paley believed listeners were listening because of the talent, not because of which platform hosted them. When Paley said as much to Benny, the comedian agreed. Because Paley took a personal interest in the Benny negotiations, as opposed to Sarnoff, who had never met his top-rated star, Benny was convinced to make the jump. He convinced a number of his fellow NBC performers (notably Burns and Allen, Edgar Bergen, Red Skelton and Kate Smith) to join him.|$|E

25|$|Following {{his return}} to Australia in December 1919 Bruche was {{confirmed}} as a substantive colonel in 1920, before achieving the rank of major general in 1923. He then held a number of senior positions including commandant of the New South Wales and Queensland military districts, adjutant general of the Australian forces, senior military representative for Australia in London and on the Imperial General Staff and commandant of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. In October 1935 he became Chief of the General Staff (CGS), taking over from Walter Coxen. His tenure was marked by the austerity of the economic downturn of the Great Depression, and the general malaise that crept into Australian strategic <b>thinking</b> <b>at</b> the time. He retired in 1935 at the rank of major general, being replaced as CGS by Lieutenant General Sir John Lavarack.|$|E
25|$|Convergent {{thinking}} {{is often used}} in conjunction with divergent thinking. Divergent thinking typically occurs in a spontaneous, free-flowing manner, where many creative ideas are generated and evaluated. Multiple possible solutions are explored in a short amount of time, and unexpected connections are drawn. After the process of divergent thinking has been completed, ideas and information are organized and structured using convergent thinking to decision making strategies are used leading to a single-best, or most often correct answer. Examples of divergent thinking include using brainstorming, free writing and creative <b>thinking</b> <b>at</b> the beginning of the problem solving process to generate possible solutions that can be evaluated later. Once a sufficient number of ideas have been explored, convergent thinking can be used. Knowledge, logic, probabilities and other decision-making strategies are taken into consideration as the solutions are evaluated individually in a search for a single best answer which when reached is unambiguous.|$|E

Ideas spread from this place. The first grooved pottery, which is so distinctive of the era, was made here, for example, and the first henges – stone rings with ditches round them – were erected on Orkney. Then the ideas spread {{to the rest of the}} Neolithic Britain. This was the font for new <b>thinking</b> <b>at</b> the time.|$|E

Kennedy {{said it was a}} thrilling moment and recalled <b>thinking</b> <b>at</b> the time, [...] "Here's a kid from the little village of Humberstone, Ontario being presented to the Queen."

500|$|There {{were many}} successes for the departments, {{and they were}} to {{influence}} future design <b>thinking.</b> <b>At</b> the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris, the Soviet pavilion by Konstantin Melnikov and its contents attracted both criticism and praise for its economic and working class architecture. One focus of criticism was the [...] "nakedness" [...] of the structure, in comparison to other luxurious pavilions such as that by Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann. Alexander Rodchenko designed a worker's club, and the furniture that the Wood and Metal Working Faculty (Дерметфак) contributed was an international success. The student work won several prizes, and Melnikov's pavilion won the Grand Prix. As {{a new generation of}} artist/designers, the students and faculty at Vkhutemas paved the way for designer furniture by architects such as Marcel Breuer, and Alvar Aalto later in the century.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{director}} David Lynch began casting for his psychological thriller Mulholland Drive. He interviewed Watts {{after looking}} at her headshot, without having seen any of her previous work, and offered her the lead role. Lynch later said about his selection of Watts, [...] "I saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence—possibilities {{for a lot of}} different roles, so it was a beautiful full package." [...] Conceived as a pilot for a television series, Lynch shot a large portion of it in February 1999, planning to keep it open-ended for a potential series. However, the pilot was rejected. Watts recalled <b>thinking</b> <b>at</b> the time, [...] "just my dumb luck, that I'm in the only David Lynch programme that never sees the light of day." [...] Instead, Lynch filmed an ending in October 2000, turning it into a feature film which was picked up for distribution.|$|E

500|$|British {{composer}} Charlie Mole {{wrote the}} score to Northanger Abbey, while the Pemberley Players provided other authentic pieces of music. Sue Mythen choreographed the ballroom scenes. Speaking to Benji Wilson of the Radio Times, Jones revealed the dance sessions {{were the most}} taxing part of the shoot. She explained that the cast had to learn all of the ballroom dances from scratch and they spent a week going over them {{to make sure they}} were right. She explained, [...] "But what happens is as soon as you put the dialogue in, the dancing just goes to pot! So it's all about putting the movement and the dialogue together and remembering what your character is supposed to be <b>thinking</b> <b>at</b> the same time – that's quite tricky!" [...] Jones praised Mythen and said the teacher often reminded the actors to relax into the dance and remember that their character would have been doing it for years, as they would have learnt at an early age. Jones added [...] "the novelty for us with three weeks of dancing is not quite the same!" ...|$|E
500|$|Paine's Quaker {{upbringing}} predisposed him to deistic <b>thinking</b> <b>at</b> {{the same}} time that it positioned him firmly within the tradition of religious Dissent. Paine acknowledged that he was indebted to his Quaker background for his skepticism, but the Quakers' esteem for plain speaking, a value expressed both explicitly and implicitly in The Age of Reason, influenced his writing even more. As the historian E. P. Thompson has put it, Paine [...] "ridiculed the authority of the Bible with arguments which the collier or country girl could understand". His description of the story of the virgin birth of Jesus demystifies biblical language: it is [...] "an account of a young woman engaged to be married, and while under this engagement she is, to speak plain language, debauched by a ghost". Quaker conversion narratives also influenced the style of The Age of Reason; Davidson and Scheick argue that its [...] "introductory statement of purpose, a fervid sense of inward inspiration, a declared expression of conscience, and an evangelical intention to instruct others" [...] resemble the personal confessions of American Quakers.|$|E
500|$|Blackstone's primary {{legacy is}} his written work, {{specifically}} the Commentaries on the Laws of England. Demand for reprinted, abridged and translated versions was [...] "almost inexhaustible" [...] in the 18th and 19th centuries, although the Commentaries {{emphasis on the}} sovereignty of Parliament drew ire. Alexis de Tocqueville described Blackstone as [...] "an inferior writer, without liberality of mind or depth of judgment". Other commentators differ; one described him as [...] "the core element in the British Enlightenment", comparing him to Montesquieu, Beccaria and Voltaire. Academics {{have said that the}} Commentaries were crucial in changing English Law from a system based on actions to a system of substantive law. At the time of publication, the common law of England was still, in some ways, in its infancy, with people uncertain as to what the law was. The Commentaries helped to solidify legal <b>thinking.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, legal education had stalled, and Blackstone's work gave the Law [...] "at least a veneer of scholarly respectability". William Searle Holdsworth, one of Blackstone's successors as Vinerian Professor, argued that [...] "if the Commentaries had not been written when they were written, I think it very doubtful that , and other English speaking countries would have so universally adopted the [...] law".|$|E
