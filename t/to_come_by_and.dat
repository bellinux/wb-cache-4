5|$|Glamorgan sausage (Welsh: Selsig Morgannwg) is a {{traditional}} Welsh vegetarian sausage for which the main ingredients are cheese (usually Caerphilly), leeks and breadcrumbs. The earliest published mention of the dish is from the 1850s in the book Wild Wales by George Borrow, although earlier records in the Glamorgan Archives show a version which contains pork. The modern vegetarian version became popular during the Second World War when meat was harder <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by,</b> <b>and</b> is now mass-produced by at least two companies. Variations include swapping the leeks for onions, as well as different herbs and spices, and various types of cheese.|$|E
25|$|The Christianization of the Rus' {{people is}} {{supposed}} to have begun in the 860s and was the first stage in the process of Christianization of the East Slavs which continued well into the 11th century. Despite its historical and cultural significance, records detailing the event are frustratingly hard <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by,</b> <b>and</b> it seems to have been forgotten by the time of Vladimir's Baptism of Kiev in the 980s.|$|E
25|$|It {{is also at}} {{this time}} when the concept of fashion, {{as it is known}} today, begins. Prior to this point, clothes as a means of {{self-expression}} were limited. Guild-controlled systems of production and distribution, and the sumptuary laws made clothing both hard <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> expensive for the common people. However, by 1750 the consumer revolution brought about cheaper copies of fashionable styles, allowing members of all classes to partake in fashionable dress. Thus, fashion begins to represent an expression of individuality. The constant change in dress mirrored political and social ideals of the time.|$|E

25|$|The {{arrival of}} the Civil War in 1861 took its toll on the library {{collection}}. Members were able to {{remove some of the}} collection prior to the library's occupation by Union troops. The library was used as a hospital and much of the library's collection was lost during this time. After the war, the building was sold to a private owner who planned to turn the building into a private residence and asked the library to remove {{what was left of the}} collection. Funds continued to be hard <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> in 1879, the Library Company closed. The remainder of its collection was stored in Peabody Hall.|$|E
25|$|In January 2006, Killen joined Hibernian, {{and scored}} 11 {{goals in the}} early part of the 2006–07 season, but a {{ruptured}} Achilles tendon prematurely ended his season in January. Killen's contract with Hibernian expired in the summer of 2007, and, after using the Easter Road cub's facilities to regain fitness, he then signed for Celtic on a three-year contract, but found first team opportunities hard <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by,</b> <b>and</b> was loaned to Norwich City during the 2008–09 season. Killen rejoined his former Celtic manager Gordon Strachan at Middlesbrough in January 2010. Seven months later he moved to China to play for Shenzhen Ruby. He switched clubs to Chongqing in February 2012.|$|E
25|$|Having won promotion, the Spiders only lasted {{one season}} in the Second Division. A good start was made but after the New Year results became {{increasingly}} hard <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> Queen's were relegated {{on the last day}} on goal difference. The following season featured a new and largely inexperienced team and Queen's did not win a match until November. There was a period of revival for the team and some great results were achieved, but the poor start meant that Queen's finished bottom of the Third Division, and thus, bottom of Scottish football, {{for the first time in}} their history. The start to the following season was unspectacular but the team managed to get to the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup before losing 4–3 to Brechin City at Hampden. Months before, McCormack had been made part-time by Queen's. When Morton made an approach for his services in November 2002, he left to take the full-time position.|$|E

500|$|With {{the advent}} of the Great Depression, Derrick scraped a living from odd jobs—such as fixing {{bicycles}} and selling newspapers—to supplement his job as a baker. When in 1931, the Depression worsened, Derrick lost his bakery job and, with friends, headed by bicycle for the regional town of Berri, approximately [...] away, in search of work. Jobs in Berri were hard <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> Derrick and two friends spent the next few months living in a tent {{on the banks of the}} Murray River. When the annual Royal Adelaide Show opened that year, Derrick went to the boxing pavilion to accept a challenge of staying upright for three rounds with the ex-lightweight champion of Australia. Although he was knocked down in the second round, he immediately got back to his feet and won the bet; albeit at the cost of a black eye, and a few bruised ribs.|$|E
500|$|Bute's land {{holdings}} in Glamorgan were {{spread out across}} the county and he took steps to consolidate them, selling around [...] {{of some of the}} outlying properties in the west and investing heavily in buying [...] of land around Cardiff between 1814 and 1826. The rising prices of land and the costs of the docks brought an end to this expansion. Estimating the profitability of the Glamorgan estates is challenging because of the way that the accounts were drawn up during the period, but estimates suggest that once land purchases and the dock building cost were factored in, the estates cost the marquess much more than they delivered in income. Bute borrowed heavily; he had inherited debts of £62,500, but by {{the time of his death}} owed £493,887. Financing and supporting this debt was difficult, particularly during the early 1840s, when credit was hard <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by,</b> <b>and</b> John was forced to juggle lenders and different lines of credit. He believed that ultimately his investments would provide a rich return, and in 1844 noted that he thought [...] "well of the prospects of my income in the distance".|$|E

2500|$|Colonizing Mercury {{would involve}} similar {{challenges}} as the Moon {{as there are}} few volatile elements, no atmosphere and the surface gravity is lower than Earth's. However, the planet also receives almost seven times the solar flux as the Earth/Moon system. [...] Geologist Stephen Gillett has suggested this will make Mercury an ideal place to build solar sails, which could launch as folded up [...] "chunks" [...] by mass driver from Mercury's surface. [...] Once in space the solar sails would deploy. Since Mercury's solar constant is 6.5 times higher than Earth's, energy for the mass driver should be easy <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by,</b> <b>and</b> solar sails near Mercury would have 6.5 times the thrust they do near Earth. This could make Mercury an ideal place to acquire materials useful in building hardware to send to (and terraform) Venus.

In 1861 the British garrison was withdrawn from Western Australia, {{and so that}} year an Act of Parliament was passed authorising {{the creation of a}} corps of volunteers. Around this time, the colony's military forces totalled about 700 men serving in foot and mounted infantry units, organised into the Western Australian Volunteer Force which was raised primarily in Perth, Fremantle and Pinjarra. By 1862 the force consisted of units such as the Perth Volunteer Rifles, the Fremantle Volunteer Rifles and the Pinjarra Mounted Volunteers. Training was hard <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by,</b> <b>and</b> although the unit was enthusiastic, records show that discipline and poor attendance became a problem as the number of volunteers fell.
