50|$|Like Getter, the {{machines}} assemble {{in three different}} ways to form three robots: Gekiganger III is formed with Jet as the head and torso, Marine as its waist and upper legs, and Tank as its lower legs, and is similar <b>to</b> <b>Getter</b> 1 in its preference for air combat.

Iron precipitation was studied at a temperature range between 600 °C and 700 °C for various times. The results indicate that iron precipitation is strongly affected by the thermal history of the wafers.

30|$|The aims of {{this work}} are <b>to</b> <b>getter</b> {{undesirable}} impurities from low-cost multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers and then enhance their electronic properties. We used an efficient process which consists of applying phosphorus diffusion into a sacrificial porous silicon (PS) layer in which the gettered impurities have been trapped after the heat treatment. As we have expected, after removing the phosphorus-rich PS layer, the electrical properties of the mc-Si wafers were significantly improved. The PS layers, realized {{on both sides of}} the mc-Si substrates, were formed by the stain-etching technique. The phosphorus treatment was achieved using a liquid POCl 3 -based source {{on both sides of the}} mc-Si wafers. The realized phosphorus/PS/Si/PS/phosphorus structures were annealed at a temperature ranging between 700 °C and 950 °C under a controlled O 2 atmosphere, which allows phosphorus to diffuse throughout the PS layers and <b>to</b> <b>getter</b> eventual metal impurities towards the phosphorus-doped PS layer. The effect of this gettering procedure was investigated by means of internal quantum efficiency and the dark current–voltage (I-V) characteristics. The minority carrier lifetime measurements were made using a WTC- 120 photoconductance lifetime tester. The serial resistance and the shunt resistance carried out from the dark I-V curves confirm this gettering-related solar cell improvement. It has been shown that the photovoltaic parameters of the gettered silicon solar cells were improved with regard to the ungettered one, which proves the beneficial effect of this gettering process on the conversion efficiency of the multicrystalline silicon solar cells.|$|E
40|$|We present here {{experimental}} {{results on the}} gettering of iron in Czochralski-grown silicon by phosphorus implantation. The gettering efficiency and the gettering mechanisms in a high resistivity implanted emitter are determined {{as a function of}} both initial iron level and gettering anneal. The results show that gettering in implanted emitters can be efficient if precipitation at the emitter is activated. This requires low gettering temperatures and/or high initial contamination level. The fastest method <b>to</b> <b>getter</b> iron from the bulk is to rapidly nucleate iron precipitates before the gettering anneal. Here, this was achieved by a fast ramp to the room temperature in between the implantation anneal and the gettering anneal. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Cathodoluminescence {{is used to}} {{investigate}} the phenomenon of relatively efficient band-to-band luminescence from silicon specimens processed to contain near surface dislocations. Dislocations are produced either by ion implantation and subsequent high-temperature annealing or by mechanical abrasion of specimens having {{a wide range of}} doping concentrations. It is found that the luminescence is not directly related to the presence of dislocations and, in some cases, can be enhanced by low temperature annealing. This luminescence behaviour is explained by the effect of competing non-radiative recombination due to impurity deep levels and Auger recombination. The enhancement observed in some specimens is due <b>to</b> <b>gettering</b> of the deep level impurities. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co. KGaA...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} {{origin of}} minority carrier trapping centers in multicrystalline silicon is explored in both gettered and non-gettered material.

The other type is impervious <b>to</b> <b>gettering</b> and is correlated to the dislocation density.
