In the event of Zayd's death, the command was to be taken over by Ja`far ibn Abī Tālib, and if Jafar were to be killed, the command would {{be in the hands of}} `Abd Allah ibn Rawahah. In the event <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> were killed, the men of the expedition were to select a commander from amongst themselves.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study by}} He et al. used a simple {{epidemic}} model, to incorporate three factors including school opening and closing, temperature changes {{over the course}} of the outbreak, and human behavioral changes in response to the outbreak to infer the cause of the three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Their modelling results showed <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> factors are important but human behavioral responses showed the largest effects.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, the Galapagos {{sea lion}} and Japanese sea lion were {{classified}} as subspecies of the California sea lion. However, a genetic study in 2007 found <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> are in fact separate species. The lineages of the California and Japanese sea lion appear to have split off 2.2 million years ago during the Pliocene. The California sea lion differs from the Galapagos sea lion in its greater sexual dimorphism. The Steller sea lion is the closest extant relative of the Zalophus sea lions, being a sister taxon.|$|E

He further suggested that the family was probably closely connected to Margaret de Abernethy, heiress of the old lay abbots and lords of Abernethy. Margaret had patronage over both the church of Abernethy and, as probable owner of the barony of Inverarity, the church there.|$|E
5|$|All banksias have {{developed}} proteoid or cluster roots {{in response to}} the nutrient poor conditions of Australian soils (particularly lacking in phosphorus). The plant develop masses of fine lateral roots that form a mat-like structure underneath the soil surface, and enable it to extract nutrients as efficiently possible out of the soil. A study of three co-occurring species in banksia woodland in southwestern Australia—Banksia menziesii, B. attenuata and B. ilicifolia—found <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> develop fresh roots in September after winter rainfall, and that the bacteria populations associated with the root systems of B. menziesii differ from the other two, and that they also change depending on the age of the roots.|$|E
5|$|At a 2006 {{conference on}} Commonwealth honours, Christopher McCreery, {{an expert on}} Canada's honours, raised the concern that the three grades of the Order of Canada were {{insufficient}} to recognize the nation's very best; one suggestion was to add two more levels to the order, equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders. The order of precedence also came under scrutiny, particularly the anomaly <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> grades of the Order of Canada supersede the top levels {{of each of the}} other orders (except the Order of Merit), contrary to international practice.|$|E

5|$|During {{the rainy}} night of 2 January 1968, six men {{dressed in black}} uniforms were seen outside the {{defensive}} wire of the main base by members of a listening post. After failing {{to respond to a}} challenge, they were fired upon and five were killed outright while the sixth, although wounded, escaped. This event prompted Cushman to reinforce Lownds {{with the rest of the}} 2nd Battalion, 26th Marines. This marked the first time <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> battalions of the 26th Marine Regiment had operated together in combat since the invasion of Iwo Jima during the Second World War. To cover a defilade near the Rao Quan River, four companies from 2/26 were immediately sent out to occupy Hill 558, with another manning Hill 861A.|$|E
5|$|Ignoring the batteries, Stopford {{ordered his}} {{squadron}} to attack at 09:00 on 24 February, HMS Defiance leading the line. Shortly after the main batteries of Stopford's ships {{of the line}} came into the battle, the French ships were overwhelmed {{one by one and}} shortly after noon all three had been driven ashore with heavy casualties. British histories recount <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> were destroyed, although French histories report that they were salvaged but found to be damaged beyond repair. The fleet under Willaumez was trapped in the anchorage at Basque Roads on 26 February and defeated at the Battle of Basque Roads in April with heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|In October 1941, Reggie {{was offered}} a post as {{lecturer}} at Farouk University in Alexandria. The couple moved from Cairo to share a flat with fellow teacher Robert Liddell. The Germans regularly bombed the city, and the raids terrified Manning, who irritated Reggie and Liddell by insisting <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> descend to the air raid shelter whenever the sirens wailed. Almost immediately after her arrival in Alexandria came devastating news of her brother Oliver's death in a plane crash. The emotional upset this caused prevented her from writing novels for several years.|$|E

5|$|Natural uranium {{consists}} of three major isotopes: uranium-238 (99.28% natural abundance), uranium-235 (0.71%), and uranium-234 (0.0054%). All three are radioactive, emitting alpha particles, with the exception <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission, rather than alpha emission. There are also five other trace isotopes: uranium-239, which is formed when 238U undergoes spontaneous fission, releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238U atom; uranium-237, which is formed when 238U captures a neutron but emits two more, which then decays to neptunium-237; and finally, uranium-233, which is formed in the decay chain of that neptunium-237. It is also expected that thorium-232 {{should be able to}} undergo double beta decay, which would produce uranium-232, but this has not yet been observed experimentally.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{the orbit}} of the comet showed that the Great Comet of 1882 was moving on an almost {{identical}} path to previous great comets seen in C/1843 D1 and C/1880 C1. These comets had also suddenly appeared in the morning sky and had passed extremely close to the Sun at perihelion. One suggestion was <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> were in fact the same comet, with an orbital period that was being drastically shortened at each perihelion passage. However, studies showed this to be untenable, as the orbital period of this comet is 772 ± 3 years {{and the others are}} 600–800 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} type of tower {{used was}} a massive self-supporting delta pylon, or waist pylon, which consumed 21 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line. This type of pylon {{was used for the}} first 735kV power line from the Manic-Outardes power stations to the load centre of Montreal. There are two significant variations of the delta pylon; one has longer side crossbars such <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> bundles of conductors are suspended on V-shaped insulators. The other has shorter side crossbars, such that the two outside bundles are hung on a vertical insulator string and only the middle bundle is hung with a V-shaped insulator.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} of 1159 {{and the subsequent}} schism shows the necessity of amending the rules concerning papal elections. The decree Licet de evitanda discordia issued by the Third Lateran Council in 1179 abolished the rule of unanimity in favour {{of the rule of}} the majority of two thirds. The decree confirmed also <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> orders of the College of Cardinals (bishops, priests and deacons) are equal in the papal elections. Although the practice allowing the participation of cardinal-priests and cardinal-deacons on equal rights with cardinal-bishops had been introduced no later than in the papal election, 1118, the decree In Nomine Domini (1059) conferring the special electoral rights on the cardinal-bishops had never been formally revoked up to that time.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} some debate over the {{relationship}} of Mammuthus to Loxodonta or Elephas. Some DNA studies suggest Mammuthus is {{more closely related to}} the former while others point to the latter. However, analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome profile of the woolly mammoth (sequenced in 2005) supports Mammuthus being more closely related to Elephas. Morphological evidence supports Mammuthus and Elephas as sister taxa while comparisons of protein albumin and collagen have concluded <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> genera are equally related to each other. Some scientists believe a cloned mammoth embryo could one day be implanted in an Asian elephant's womb.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, it was Newton's friend, {{editor and}} publisher, Edmond Halley, who, in his 1705 Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets, used Newton's new laws to {{calculate}} the gravitational effects of Jupiter and Saturn on cometary orbits. This calculation enabled him, after examining historical records, to determine that the orbital elements of a second comet that had appeared in 1682 were nearly {{the same as those}} of two comets that had appeared in 1531 (observed by Petrus Apianus) and 1607 (observed by Johannes Kepler). Halley thus concluded <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> comets were, in fact, the same object returning about every 76 years, a period that has since been found to vary between 74–79 years. After a rough estimate of the perturbations the comet would sustain from the gravitational attraction of the planets, he predicted its return for 1758. Halley died in 1742 before he could observe this himself.|$|E
