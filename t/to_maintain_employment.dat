25|$|Wages do {{not fall}} enough during recessions to prevent {{unemployment}} from rising. If {{the demand for}} labour falls, this lowers wages. But because wages have fallen, the probability of 'shirking' (workers not exerting effort) has risen. If employment levels are to be maintained, through a sufficient lowering of wages, workers will be less productive than before through the shirking effect. As a consequence, in the model, wages do not fall enough <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>employment</b> levels at the previous state, because firms want to avoid excessive shirking by their workers. So, unemployment must rise during recessions, because wages are kept 'too high'.|$|E

Natural growth is the growth an economy requires <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> full <b>employment.</b> For example, If the labor force grows at 3 percent per year, then <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> full <b>employment,</b> the economy’s annual growth rate must be 3 percent.|$|R

Student surveys indicated that a majority of ITT Technical Institute students worked at least part-time during their programs of study.

Although policies vary from state to state, rehabilitation counselors who work in the federal/state systems typically must hold a master's degree in rehabilitation counseling, special education or a related field, and are required to be certified or be eligible to sit for the certification examination. People accepting employment in the federal/state Vocational Rehabilitation programs do so with the agreement they will meet these qualifications by a specified date <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>employment.</b>|$|E
40|$|People {{with autism}} {{tend to have}} {{difficulties}} with the social relationships in the workplace, which are a crucial aspect <b>to</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>employment.</b> In this study, we investigated whether disclosure of an autism spectrum disorder would improve adults’ attitudes toward a potential coworker with autism. Participants (93 college students, 93 working adults) {{were randomly assigned to}} read one of three vignettes describing the same interaction with a potential coworker with moderately severe ASD, but different levels of disclosure. As hypothesized, disclosure, as compared to no disclosure, led significantly more positive attitudes toward and higher willingness to work with the coworker. Disclosure significantly increased positive judgments of the coworker’s warmth, although it had no significant impact on judgments of the coworker’s competence. This research indicates that disclosure of autism to coworkers may be beneficial in improving attitudes toward people with autism, which could ultimately improve working relationships of those with autism...|$|R

Hence, labeling either habitual criminals or those who have caused serious harm as [...] "criminals" [...] is not constructive. Society may use more specific labels such as [...] "murderer" [...] or [...] "rapist" [...] or [...] "child abuser" [...] to demonstrate more clearly after the event the extent of its disapproval, but there is a slightly mechanical determinism in asserting that the application of a label will invariably modify the behavior of the one labeled. Further, if one of the functions of the penal system is to reduce recidivism, applying a long-term label may cause prejudice against the offender, resulting in the inability <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>employment</b> and social relationships.|$|E
50|$|Elliotts {{had been}} asked in 1945 by Chilton Aircraft Ltd to make one set of wings for the Chilton Olympia, a glider that had been {{developed}} in pre-war Germany as the DFS Olympia Meise. This had been designed by Hans Jacobs and selected as the glider for the 1940 Summer Olympics. The German drawings were not detailed and so entirely new drawings were made by Chilton that merely retained the Meise Olympia's aerodynamic shape. Otherwise it was a complete re-design and resulted in a stronger and heavier (+30 kg) aircraft. <b>To</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>employment</b> at their factory, Elliotts refused to sell the wing jigs that they had made for the prototype. Consequently, Chilton gave up all aircraft work, agreeing to sell to Elliotts the production rights, fuselage jigs, and work in hand on all Olympia gliders.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, a court’s {{decision}} to grant or deny bail {{has a direct}} impact on the outcome of a criminal case. Incarcerated defendants are significantly less able to help in his/her defense for freedom in comparison to someone on bail who is unrestricted or perhaps conditionally restricted to home confinement. They are also unable to arrange meetings with suspected witnesses, and/or provide their attorney with important information about the case, thus creating logistical barriers. People that are denied bail are more likely to plead guilty in thoughts that they will lose at trial. Those denied bail are often sentenced to longer amounts of time than those who are granted pretrial release. Additionally, incarceration already has adverse effects resulting in many defendants' inability <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>employment,</b> access mental and physical healthcare, and engage in constant communication with their family and friends.|$|E
