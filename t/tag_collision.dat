40|$|Abstract:- Tag {{identification}} {{is an important}} measure in RFID systems with applications for monitoring and tracking. A RFID reader recognizes tags through communication over a shared wireless channel. When multiple tags transmit their IDs simultaneously, the signals collide and this collision disturbs a reader’s identification process. Collision problem {{can be divided into}} reader collision and <b>tag</b> <b>collision.</b> <b>Tag</b> <b>collision</b> is taken into account in this study since most of the applications involve <b>tag</b> <b>collision</b> problem. Therefore, an anti-collision protocol is developed to solve this issue. This study focuses on the most widely used passive tag, as it is simple and cheaper. Here, a circuit has been proposed that can implement the anti-collision protocol for passive tags, and its functionality has also been investigated. Among several anti-collision protocols, the Binary Tree Protocol is chosen and a circuit based on Binary Tree Protocol has been constructed using SIMUAID simulator. In Binary Tree Protocol, the tag ID with lowest bit has the priority to be identified first. The circuit is able to successfully solve the anti-collision problem in RFID system to recognize the tag’s ID.

30|$|Current {{anti-collision}} algorithms can {{be classified}} as aloha-based algorithms and tree-based algorithms. Aloha-based algorithms estimate the number of tags and assign the proper number of slots to reduce the probability of <b>tag</b> <b>collisions.</b> They can be further classified as dynamic frame slotted aloha [1 – 5] and splitting frame slotted aloha [6 – 8]. The major {{difference is that the}} former dynamically adjusts the number of slots allocated for each frame and allows all unrecognized tags to share these slots while the latter splits unrecognized <b>tags</b> into different <b>collision</b> sets and allows each set to use individual slots separately. However, a limitation of aloha-based algorithms is the starvation problem, in which the tag cannot be identified because its responses are constantly colliding with others.|$|R

40|$|A tag-collision (or missed reads) in RFID system (Radio Frequency Identification) system degrades the {{identification}} efficiency. The so-called <b>tag</b> <b>collision</b> {{is that a}} reader cannot identify a tag when more than one tags respond to a reader at the same time. There are some major anti-collision protocols on resolving <b>tag</b> <b>collision,</b> e. g., ALOHA-based protocol, binary tree protocol, and Query Tree (QT) protocol. Up to date, most tag anti-collision protocols are QT protocols. QT protocols are categorized into M-ary query tree (QT). In the previous literature, choosing M = 3 (i. e., a ternary QT (TQT)) was proven to have the optimum performance for tag identification. Recently, Yeh et al. used parallel response approach {{to reduce the number}} of collisions. In this paper, we combine the partial response and TQT to propose an effective parallel response TQT (PRTQT) protocol.

40|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) {{provides a}} non-line-of-sight and contactless approach for object identification. But {{if there are}} multiple tags {{in the range of}} an RFID reader, <b>tag</b> <b>collision</b> can take place due to radio signal interference and therefore an anti-collision algorithm is required to resolve collisions. Recently, EPCglobal RFID generation- 2 (Gen- 2) protocol [1] is proposed for ultra-high frequency (UHF) passive tags and is being deployed. Gen- 2 designs a slotted random anti-collision algorithm, especially, an adaptive slot-counter (Q) selection algorithm. The integer-valued parameter Q in Gen- 2 plays a critical role in <b>tag</b> <b>collision</b> resolution. This adaptive algorithm dynamically adjusts the value of Q based on the type of replies from tags. In this paper, we propose an optimal Q algorithm that determines the optimal values of Q according to the number of remaining tags and in turn to optimize tag identification speed (TIS). It’s been demonstrated through extensive simulations that the proposed algorithm achieves higher TIS than Gen- 2 adaptive Q algorithm...|$|E
40|$|In {{radio-frequency}} identification (RFID) systems, <b>tag</b> <b>collision</b> resolution {{is a significant}} issue for fast tag identification. Dynamic framed slotted ALOHA (DFSA) {{is one of the}} most widely used algorithms to resolve <b>tag</b> <b>collision.</b> Collision detection (CD) plays an important role in determining the efficiency of DFSA-based algorithms because most DFSA-based algorithms determine the next frame size according to the number of collided slots in the current frame. Existing CD methods do not respond quickly enough to detect a collision and have difficulty in distinguishing a collision from noise, resulting in a degradation of system efficiency. This paper presents a CD scheme based on the EPCglobal Class- 1 Generation- 2 protocol to improve CD efficiency. This scheme enables fast and accurate CD by detecting the number of pulses transmitted by tags. The effectiveness and practical feasibility of the scheme is verified by simulation and implementation. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed scheme achieves faster identification speed than the conventional methods, especially under noise conditions...|$|E

30|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) has substantially {{replaced the}} conventional bar code system of automated identification because RFID is faster, more convenient, and contactless. The many RFID applications developed so far include inventory control, object tracking, and supply chain management. An RFID system usually contains a reader and multiple tags. Each tag {{has a unique}} identification (ID), and the reader recognizes all tags in its radio range through wireless communication. However, collisions occur when multiple tags transmit their IDs simultaneously because they share the same wireless channel. In this case, the reader cannot immediately recognize any tags, and the collided tags must retransmit their IDs until they are identified. This wastes bandwidth and delays identification. Therefore, an efficient anti-collision algorithm is needed to reduce <b>tag</b> <b>collisions</b> and to accelerate tag identification.|$|R

Current probabilistic anti-collision approaches suffer from tag starvation due to the inaccurate Backlog estimation and have a low performance in some cases.

The PCT approach creates new tag grouping strategies using particular equations, according to the optimal efficiency obtained for a specific number of tags.

Due to the operating frequencies of RFID systems, the most probable method to achieve MPR capabilities is through reader cooperation, which remains as an open research area. Another contribution of this paper is the identification of <b>tag</b> <b>collisions</b> as a method to improve privacy and security.

40|$|RFID (radio {{frequency}} identification) is a RF based identification system, where RF reader reads (and writes) {{data from}} each entity (RF tag).

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceRadio-Frequency Identification (RFID) {{has made}} a revolutionary mark in {{identifying}} and tracking number of different industry objects, which has reduced the manual tracking to much higher extent. The key problem which {{is associated with the}} reading of RFID <b>tags</b> is the <b>collision</b> between <b>tag</b> responses, which makes the reading more difficult and hence requires more time to complete identifying all <b>tags.</b> <b>Collisions</b> also reduce the accuracy of the reader to read tags at any given instant of time.

The purpose of this thesis was to design a protocol which would be helpful to read RFID tags in more efficient manner in terms of time and energy. A new RFID anti-collision protocol Intelligent ALOHA (I-ALOHA) is proposed that is a combination of two existing approaches: Intelligent Query Tree (IQT) protocol and Abramson’s Logic of Hiring Access (ALOHA) method. I-ALOHA, like IQT, divides the tag IDs into two parts and reads only postfix parts of the tags when the prefixes are common.
