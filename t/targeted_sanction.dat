It argues that the Court’s judgement of 3 September 2008 in Kadi is to be welcomed, also from an internatio-nal perspective. It rightly rejected the approach presented by the Court of First Instance, which, albeit stressing the importance of the UN Charter, ultimately {{turned out to be a}} ‘false friend’ of international law. By largely following the Advocate General’s Opinion, the Court maintained the integrity and the superior human rights standard of the EU legal order.

40|$|This {{collection}} of essays examines the implications of ECJ’s approach to UN-related counter terrorism measures against individuals (the so-called ‘smart sanctions’), as expressed by its ruling in Kadi, annulling an EC act implementing a UNSC resolution. The impact of this judgment on the EC legal order, on {{its relationship with the}} UN Charter, and on the case-law of the European Court of Human rights (‘ECtHR’) are the threads of this collection. Gaja defends the idea that the UN Charter is so special that it is inappropriate to regard it as any other international Treaty concluded by the Member States for the purpose of art. 307 TEC. Tomuschat criticises the ECJ for exempting the human rights, as they are anchored in the European system, from the subordination to the UN system, thus making them as ‘world standard. ’ Cannizzaro is very critical of the ECJ’s ruling as far as the competence to review EC measures, implementing UNSC, as well as the standards of review vis-à-vis the UNSC resolutions are concerned. Critical comments are also addressed by Pavoni’s paper also commenting on the latter topic. This author argues that the ECJ could have examined whether the challenged EC measures were in line with customary international law. Lavranos takes a positive attitude toward the ECJ’s ruling; examines the Court’s interpretation of art. 307 of the TEC and praises the Court for its strong defence of human rights, as protected under the EC legal order. Tridimas’ paper specifically addresses this issue {{and come up with a}} positive assessment of the ECJ’s ruling. Cremona explores the ECJ’s reasoning on the EC competence to adopt smart sanctions without sparing critical remarks. Ciampi assesses the impact that the Kadi ruling could make on the case- law of another regional court, the ECtHR. Francioni and Condorelli focus on the UN system of <b>targeted</b> <b>sanction</b> to argue that it falls short of international human rights protection. The former is particularly critical of the distance that the ECJ takes from international human rights law. By contrast, Scheinin is a supporter of the ‘reconcilability’ argument: the outcome in the Kadi case is compatible with international human rights law and that the Kadi judgment should be seen as an affirmation of a high degree of coherence between EU law and international law...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{international}} community has increasingly come to abandon the use of comprehensive sanctions in favour of <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions.</b> Unlike adopting a coercive strategy on entire states, actors like the United Nations (UN) and the European Union (EU) have come to resort to measures that are aimed at individuals, groups and government members. <b>Targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> involve adopting measures such as asset freezes, travel bans, commodity sanctions, as well as arms embargoes. Eriksson argues that recent changes in the practice of sanctions from comprehensive to <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> requires a new way of understanding international sanctions practice. Not only do we need to rethink our methodology to assess recent practice, but also to rethink the very theory of sanctions. This valuable new perspective provides recent thinking on <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions,</b> trends in practice and unique case studies for evaluation.

40|$|<b>Targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> {{originated}} as a {{more refined}} tactic in response to humanitarian concerns over the unintended consequences connected to comprehensive trade embargo <b>sanctions.</b> Extending <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> to include terrorism produced further unintended consequences, in particular the faulty identification of <b>sanction</b> <b>targets.</b> This paper looks at one specific case of <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> against the financing of terrorism in order to study {{the position of the}} European Union at the United Nations Security Council. The listing of the Somali money transfer firm al Barakaat raised a number of issues involving the use of sanctions against non-state actors. It also provoked a legal challenge against the EU’s implementation of these <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions,</b> which in turn has been portrayed as a challenge to the use of <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> by the Security Council to maintain international peace and security. This paper considers first the development of <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions,</b> then EU Presidency statements at the United Nations concerning terrorism followed by a brief summary of the al Barakaat case, which motivated a number of changes in the sanctions process. Following the discussion is an assessment of the damage incurred from the misidentification of al Barakaat as a source of terrorist financing and several concluding thoughts on the location of the EU in the use of sanctions against terrorism. The central point here is the same as that frequently stated by the EU Presidency, that <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> must ensue from due process and the rule of law, whatever the venue, in order to protect human rights...|$|R

40|$|Targeted sanctions’ impact over {{rebel groups}} {{has not been}} {{examined}} by scholars, making it unclear whether the policy mechanism {{has the capacity to}} peacefully resolve intrastate armed conflicts and cease hostilities by weakening rebel groups. Considering the mentioned, the paper explores how <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> impact rebel groups, and suggests that properly monitored and effectively enforced <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> have the capacity to weaken rebel groups, via shortening rebels’ economic, military and political resources. Using the method of structured, focused comparison, the suggested hypothesis is empirically tested on the rebel groups of Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola in Angola. The findings of the study revealed that effectively monitored and enforced <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> are capable of lessening rebels’ military and political resources, however, observing sanctions impact on economic resources proved difficult. Based on the analyses and findings the paper suggests that imposition of <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> should be initiated at the early warning phase of a conflict, rather at the point when the intensity of conflict has reached its peak. ...|$|R
40|$|United Nations {{sanctions}} have undergone profound transformations {{in the past}} two decades. In 1990, the UN Security Council imposed a general, comprehensive embargo on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait. In 2015, there are 16 Sanctions Committees managing regimes that have little in common with the one imposed against Iraq in 1990. The measures imposed against Iraq were comprehensive, covering all goods coming {{in and out of the}} country, while sanctions imposed today are mostly against individuals, non-state entities and are more limited in scope. This article aims to provide empirical and systematic evidence of some of the distinctive qualities of UN <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions.</b> The analysis identifies three distinctive characteristics of <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions.</b> First, <b>targeting</b> individuals and non-state actors has permitted the use of sanctions in a wider range of crisis types. Second, the <b>targets</b> of <b>sanctions</b> are substantially different from comprehensive sanctions. Third, the form taken by sanctions is substantially different today from the trade embargoes imposed in the past. The author concludes that the Security Council should devote special attention to the designing and implementation phases of sanctions.

40|$|Defense Date: 19 / 06 / 2009 Examining Board: Thomas Biersteker (The Graduate Institute, Geneva), Peter Viggo Jakobson (Univ. Copenhagen), Friedrich V. Kratochwil (EUI), Pascal Vennesson (EUI/RSCAS) (Supervisor) Despite {{having been}} in the {{political}} and scientific limelight for nearly two decades, the question of the effectiveness of <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> continues to puzzle and engage practitioners and scholars. Having been previously tormented by the implementation failures and (un-) intended consequences of comprehensive sanctions practice, a scientific question is still warranted when thinking of targeted sanctions: Why is the design and evaluation of this tool in terms of impact so complex and what research approach would be most effective for gaining a better understanding of sanctions 'effectiveness'? To shed light on this question, this research project examines the use of EU and UN <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> as a means of addressing crises and armed conflicts. Particular attention is paid to the role of restrictive measures imposed on individual entities by the use of travel bans and targeted assets freezes. While decision-makers in collective security bodies have been actively engaged in developing the <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> instrument, there has so far been little recognition in the academic literature of what consequences <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> have had for the general theory of sanctions. In this dissertation, I demonstrate how the move from comprehensive <b>sanctions</b> to <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> requires a re-thinking, in particular when it comes to understanding and evaluating sanctions’ 'impact'. Starting by illustrating how the shift in thinking has come about and what it has meant theoretically and empirically, the dissertation illustrates various problems in the operation of sanctions. The main aim is to demonstrate the complexity of the sanctions process and the need to think holistically about it. Each component in the sanctions management and implementation process is likely to shape the final impact on the target in a way not always anticipated. Thus, besides the overall puzzle of how <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> can contribute to conflict resolution, this dissertation seeks to illustrate a number of problems with current practice. Areas addressed herein are: the problem of oversimplification when designing and evaluating sanctions, the problem of mixing symbolic and concrete sanctions, the problem of overlooking <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> as embedded in a larger strategic setting, the problem of defining a sanctions episode too broad, and finally, the problem of neglecting a target’s perception of the imposed sanctions policy. The research project is empirically oriented and contains references to interviews conducted with practitioners working with sanctions policies (with the EU and the UN). Contribution to the field is also made by the inclusion of unique interviews with a number of individuals, which have been included on the EU and UN sanctions lists. In all, the dissertation makes a theory-building attempt by discussing existing epistemological as well as methodological approaches...|$|R

40|$|Given the {{increasing}} use of <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> despite the ongoing debate on the effectiveness of <b>targeted</b> versus non-targeted <b>sanctions</b> in the existing literature, the aim of this thesis is to investigate when <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> {{are more likely to be}} effective than non-targeted sanctions in terms of achieving desired policy objectives. The thesis achieves this aim in several steps. First, instead of debating on sanctions effectiveness in general, this work aims to disaggregate sanctions by their “targetedness” which allow us to see how the design might influence the success of sanctions. Second, using selectorate framework (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2005) as a starting point of my theory, I explore whether designing sanctions in accordance with political institutional constraints of the targeted state can predetermine sanctions success. Third, given the importance of the threat stage along with the imposition stage, I examine the effect of sanctions design at two different stages of a sanction episode. To account for the threat and imposition stages on empirical part, I use an updated Threat and Imposition of Economic Sanctions dataset (Morgan, Bapat, and Kobayashi 2014), which is the only dataset that embraces both stages of a sanction episode. The underlining argument of this study claims that <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> can be effective if articulated in accordance with the targeted state’s conditions. Specifically, the model suggests that in small winning coalitions, <b>targeted</b> <b>sanctions</b> are more likely to be effective than non-targeted sanctions. While empirical evidence on the imposition stage provides mixed support for theoretical arguments, findings on the threat stage allow me to claim that the design of sanctions do have positive relationship on sanctions success. Thus, the clear implication of this study for policymakers entails that choosing the right design of <b>sanctions</b> consistent with <b>targeted</b> state’s political conditions is one of the crucial (but often times neglected) determinants of sanctions effectivenes...|$|R

40|$|Professor Ryuichi Ida’s {{contributions}} {{in the study of}} international law have been guided by his underlying conviction that law, or more precisely, law-makers, will be catching up to a social change.
