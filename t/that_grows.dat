5|$|Strobilurus esculentus and S.stephanocystis {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to S.tenacellus. S.esculentus mushrooms have thin, sharp cap margins and only fruit on fallen spruce cones. S.stephanocystis has a yellow-brown to reddish-yellow cap that is not hygrophanous. Baeospora myosura is another small agaric <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> on pine and spruce cones, but it fruits in autumn.|$|E
5|$|Another {{mushroom}} <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> on decomposing fruit bodies is Asterophora lycoperdoides, {{which is}} distinct from C.cookei because of the powdery brown asexual spores (chlamydospores) produced on the cap surface. Alexander H. Smith has noted a general similarity in appearance between C.cookei and the North American species Clitocybe sclerotoidea (then known as Tricholoma sclerotoideum), which is parasitic to Helvella lacunosa. However, C.sclerotoidea is larger than C.cookei, with cap diameters up to , and has more distantly spaced gills.|$|E

5|$|Banksia brownii, {{commonly}} known as feather-leaved banksia or Brown's banksia, is a species of shrub <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> in southwest Western Australia. An attractive plant with fine feathery leaves and large red-brown flower spikes, it usually grows as an upright bush around two metres (7ft) high, but can also occur as a small tree or a low spreading shrub. First collected in 1829 and published the following year, it is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, section Oncostylis, series Spicigerae. There are two genetically distinct forms.|$|E
5|$|Banksia epica is a shrub <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> on {{the south}} coast of Western Australia. A {{spreading}} bush with wedge-shaped serrated leaves and large creamy-yellow flower spikes, it grows up to 3½metres (11½ft) high. It is known only from two isolated populations in the remote south east of the state, near {{the western edge of}} the Great Australian Bight. Both populations occur among coastal heath on cliff-top dunes of siliceous sand.|$|E
5|$|Banksia integrifolia, {{commonly}} known as coast banksia, is a species of tree <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> along {{the east coast of}} Australia. One of the most widely distributed Banksia species, it occurs between Victoria and Central Queensland in a broad range of habitats, from coastal dunes to mountains. It is highly variable in form, but is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (82ft) in height. Its leaves have dark green upper surfaces and white undersides, a contrast that can be striking on windy days.|$|E

5|$|Banksia telmatiaea, {{commonly}} known as swamp fox banksia or rarely marsh banksia, is a shrub <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> in marshes and swamps along the lower west coast of Australia. It grows as an upright bush up to 2m (7ft) tall, with narrow leaves and a pale brown flower spike, which can produce profuse quantities of nectar. First collected in the 1840s, it was not published as a separate species until 1981; as with several other similar species it was previously included in B.sphaerocarpa (Fox Banksia).|$|E
5|$|Galerina marginata is {{widespread}} in the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and Asia, and has also been found in Australia. It is a wood-rotting fungus <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> predominantly on decaying conifer wood. An extremely poisonous species, it contains the same deadly amatoxins found in the death cap (Amanita phalloides). Ingestion in toxic amounts causes severe liver damage with vomiting, diarrhea, hypothermia, and eventual death if not treated rapidly. About ten poisonings {{have been attributed to}} the species now grouped as G.marginata over the last century.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to making secretory proteins, the rough ER makes membranes <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> in place from {{the addition of}} proteins and phospholipids. As polypeptides intended to be membrane proteins grow from the ribosomes, they are inserted into the ER membrane itself and are kept there by their hydrophobic portions. The rough ER also produces its own membrane phospholipids; enzymes built into the ER membrane assemble phospholipids. The ER membrane expands and can be transferred by transport vesicles to other components of the endomembrane system.|$|E
5|$|Larvae {{of members}} of the family Glossosomatidae in the {{suborder}} Spicipalpia create dome-shaped enclosures of silk which enables them to graze on the periphyton, the biological film <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> on stones and other objects, while carrying their enclosure around like turtles. In the family Philopotamidae, the nets are sac-like, with intricate structure and tiny mesh. The larvae have specialised mouthparts to scrape off the microflora that get trapped in the net as water flows through.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} common eland is Taurotragus oryx, composed of three words: tauros, tragos and oryx. Tauros is Greek for a bull or bullock, meaning {{the same as the}} Latin taurus. Tragos is Greek for a male goat, referring to the tuft of hair <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> in the eland's ear and its resemblance to a goat's beard. Oryx is Latin and Greek (generally orygos) for pickaxe, referring to the pointed horns of North African antelopes like the common eland and scimitar-horned oryx.|$|E
5|$|According {{to current}} knowledge, B.sessilis as an {{extremely}} hardy plant <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> {{in a range}} of soils and aspects, so long as it is given good drainage, and tolerates both drought and moderate frost. Unlike many dryandras, it grows well on limestone (alkaline) soils. It flowers very heavily and is an excellent producer of honey. It attracts birds, and is also popular with beekeepers. However, its size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens, and if given an ideal situation it may produce a great many seedlings. It is propagated only from seed, as propagating it from cuttings has proven virtually impossible. Germination takes about five or six weeks, and plants may take two years to flower.|$|E
5|$|Alongside his {{stand-alone}} illustrations, in July 1926 Hergé began {{production of}} a comic strip for Le Boy-Scout Belge, Les Aventures de Totor (The Adventures of Totor), which continued intermittent publication until 1929. Revolving around the adventures of a Boy Scout patrol leader, the comic initially featured written captions underneath the scenes, but Hergé began to experiment with other forms of conveying information, including speech bubbles. Illustrations were also published in Le Blé qui lève (The Wheat <b>That</b> <b>Grows)</b> and other publications of the Catholic Association of Belgian Young People, and Hergé produced a book jacket for Weverbergh's novel, The Soul of the Sea. Being young and inexperienced, still learning his craft, Hergé sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived Atelier de la Fleur de Lys (AFL), an organisation for Christian cartoonists.|$|E

5|$|Boletus rubroflammeus is {{a species}} of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. First {{described}} from Michigan in 1971, it {{is found in the}} eastern United States and Mexico, where it grows in a mycorrhizal association with hardwood trees. The fruit bodies (mushrooms) of the fungus have caps that are deep red to purplish red, and dark red pores. The stem has coarse, dark red reticulations (raised, net-like ridges) and a narrow yellow area at the top. All parts of the mushroom quickly stain blue when injured or cut. Lookalikes include Boletus flammans, a lighter-colored species <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> with conifers. Other similar species can be distinguished by differences in distribution, morphology, staining reaction, and microscopic characteristics. Boletus rubroflammeus mushrooms are poisonous, and can cause gastrointestinal distress if consumed.|$|E
5|$|It {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} {{to a number of}} Amanita species. It can be distinguished from A.praegraveolens microscopically by the absence of clamp connections between the cells in S.thiersii. Both S.thiersii and A.aureofloccosa have hollow stems but the latter has a more tapering stipe and the whole fruit body is yellower. A.silvifuga is another species <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> in similar locations in grassland in Texas and H. D. Thiers described the taste of both it and A. thiersii as being bitter. It can be distinguished by its darker coloration and more warted appearance.|$|E
