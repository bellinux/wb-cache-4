40|$|International audienceIntroduction. - <b>Temocillin</b> is an {{alternative}} to treat urinary tract infections with bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). The objective is {{to evaluate the use}} of <b>temocillin</b> in urinary tract infections. Materials and methods. - A systematic review of literature was carried out according to PRISMA criteria. All national and international recommendations have been reviewed regarding the indication of the use of <b>temocillin</b> in urology. Data collection on the use of <b>temocillin</b> in urinary tract infection has been performed from the Cochrane, LILACS and the Medline database. The following keywords were used: <b>temocillin,</b> extended spectrum. beta-lactamase, urinary tract infections, urine, prostate, epididymis, testis, diffusion, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics. The selection was based on the methodology, language of publication (English/French), relevance to the topic and date of publication of the articles collected. The endpoint was to provide exhaustive scientific information allowing urologists to use this antibiotic in febrile urinary infections. Results. - Bacteria producing ESBL has a relatively high susceptible to <b>temocillin,</b> ranging from 61 % to 90 %. These rates would allow its use in probabilistic. The dosage recommended is currently, in the normo-renal patient, 4 g per day by intermittent infusion or continuously after a loading dose of 2 g. Some studies argue, particularly in case of difficult clinical situations or obese patients, for administration of high doses (6 g/ 24 h) rather continuous infusion. There is no evident relationship between high doses and side effects. With an excellent urinary and prostatic diffusion, temocilllin might be recommend for the treatment of ESBL prostatitis. Conclusion. - <b>Temocillin</b> is known to have good urinary and prostatic diffusion. According to our results, this antibiotics is now a reliable alternative for the treatment of documented ESBL urinary tract infections. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|E

Phenotypic carbapenemase detection was performed with discs (Rosco) containing meropenem (10 μg), <b>temocillin</b> (30 μg), meropenem + phenyl boronic acid (PBA), meropenem + DPA, meropenem + BA + DPA, and meropenem + cloxacillin (CL). Absence of synergy between meropenem and BA and/or DPA and a <b>temocillin</b> zone ≤ 10 mm was used to identify OXA- 48.

Strains were screened for ESBL production using cefotaxime and ceftazidime screen agar plates and by double ESBL E-tests. The MIC of <b>temocillin</b> and of five comparators was determined using the E-test method. ESBLs were characterized at one central laboratory by isoelectric focusing, PCR for bla genes of the SHV, TEM, and CTX-M families, and by DNA sequencing. The prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae averaged 11. 8 % and ranged between 3. 0 and 29 % in the different hospitals. Meropenem exhibited the highest in vitro activity overall (mode MIC 0. 064 microg; MIC(90); 0. 19 microg/ml), whereas ceftazidime (MIC(90) > 256 microg/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MIC(90) > 32 microg/ml) scored the worst. <b>Temocillin</b> was active against more than 90 % of the isolates including most AmpC- and ESBL-producing isolates. These data indicate the well preserved activity of <b>temocillin</b> over the years against Enterobacteriaceae and show the wide variation in prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates in Belgian intensive care units. Prospective clinical studies are, however, needed to validate the usefulness of <b>temocillin</b> {{in the treatment of}} microbiologically documented infections caused by ESBL- and/or AmpC- overproducing nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae pathogens. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Temocillin</b> is a 6 alpha-methoxy {{penicillin}} {{which shows}} poor {{affinity for the}} penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of Escherichia coli K- 12 when tested by competition with [14 C]penicillin G or [125 I]penicillin X. When the reaction conditions for the radiolabeled penicillin used in this procedure were modified by lowering the temperature (2 degrees C) and reducing the incubation time (3 min), <b>temocillin</b> showed a much higher affinity for PBP- 3 and improved affinity for the other PBPs, {{with the exception of}} PBP- 2. Direct labeling procedures with [14 C]temocillin also showed that the compound had affinity for PBPs 1 a and 3. These results are more consistent with the effects of <b>temocillin</b> on the morphology of E. coli than the poor affinity values obtained by the classical competitive procedure. Reasons for the disparity between these assay systems are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundTemocillin is {{currently}} {{used in the}} treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations caused by Burkholderia cepacia complex and multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients despite little published clinical data. This study assessed if intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy including <b>temocillin</b> was equivalent to standard combination therapy for an acute exacerbation. MethodsA retrospective, pilot cross-over study. Adult patients attending two CF centres between 1997 and 2006 who had received a course of IV antibiotics including <b>temocillin</b> (TIV) and a further IV course (within ± 1  year) which did not include <b>temocillin</b> (NTIV) were included. Outcome measures at the start and end of each IV course were recorded (FEV 1 %, FVC%). ResultsTwenty six patients had received <b>temocillin.</b> Baseline values of FEV 1 % predicted were comparable for both groups (TIV: 37 (18 %), NTIV: 39 (20 %)). FEV 1 % increased by 7. 12 (11. 67) % after TIV (p< 0. 01) and 6. 65 (7. 62) % after NTIV (p< 0. 01). There {{was no significant difference between}} the IV courses in mean %change in lung function TIV versus NTIV (FEV 1 0. 46 % [95 %CI: − 4. 55 to 5. 48 %]). ConclusionThese data suggest equivalence in the lung function outcome of IV antibiotic therapy includingtemocillin versus standard IV antibiotic therapy...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the stability of a mixture of <b>temocillin</b> 20 mg/ml in 5 % dextrose and in 0. 9 % sodium chloride polyolefin bags after freezing, microwave thawing and long-term storage at 5 ± 3 °C. Methods The stability of ten polyolefin bags containing 20 mg/ml of <b>temocillin,</b> five bags in 5 % dextrose and five bags in 0. 9 % sodium chloride, prepared under aseptic conditions was studied after freezing for 1 month at – 20 °C, thawing in a microwave oven with a validated cycle, and stored at 5 ± 3 °C. Over 30 days, <b>temocillin</b> concentrations were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Visual inspections, microscope observation, spectrophotometric measurements and pH measurements were also performed. Results and discussion No precipitation occurred in the preparations but minor colour change was observed. No microaggregate was observed with optical microscopy or revealed by a change of absorbance. Based on a shelf life of 95 % residual potency, <b>temocillin</b> infusions were stable at least 11 days in 5 % dextrose and 14 days in 0. 9 % sodium chloride after freezing and microwave thawing (corresponding at the period where 95 % lower confidence limit of the concentration-time profile remained superior to 95 % of the initial concentration). During this period, the pH values of drug solutions have been observed to decrease without affecting chromatographic parameters. Conclusion Within these limits, <b>temocillin</b> in 5 % dextrose and in 0. 9 % sodium chloride infusions may be prepared and frozen in advance by a centralized intravenous admixture service then thawed before use in clinical units...|$|E
40|$|The {{relevance}} of protein binding to penetration of beta-lactams into body fluids was investigated {{by examining the}} distribution of amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, clavulanic acid, <b>temocillin,</b> and ticarcillin into rabbit peripheral lymph after intravenous administration. The elimination half-lives in rabbit plasma varied between 0. 34 h (<b>temocillin)</b> and 1. 80 h (ceftriaxone), and the half-lives measured in lymph {{were similar to those}} in plasma (0. 37 to 1. 76 h). The percent penetration (area under the concentration-time curve in lymph/area under the concentration-time curve in plasma x 100) was high for amoxicillin (97. 6 %), <b>temocillin</b> (89. 4 %), and clavulanic acid (90. 8 %) but was lower for ticarcillin (76. 0 %) and for ceftriaxone (67. 3 %). There was a direct correlation between plasma protein binding and percent penetration. Correction for plasma and tissue binding increased the percent penetration for all compounds, and figures approached 100 %. The results presented demonstrate the use of this model to examine the relationships between plasma pharmacokinetics, protein binding, and distribution of antibiotics...|$|E
