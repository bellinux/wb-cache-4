50|$|Arising {{out of the}} 1897 Congress, a {{decision}} was taken to form a more centralised <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>structure</b> that would enable a more militant approach {{to be taken to}} fighting the employer and even achieving the socialist transformation of society. The result was the General Federation of Trade Unions which was formed in 1899. For some years it was unclear which body (the GFTU or the TUC) would emerge as the national trade union centre for the UK and for a while both were recognised as such by different fraternal organisations in other countries. However, it was soon agreed amongst the major unions that the TUC should take the leading role and that this would be the central body of the organised Labour Movement in the UK. The GFTU continued in existence and remains to this day as a federation of (smaller, often craft-based) trade unions providing common services and facilities to its members (especially education and training services).|$|E

They aim to secure core labour rights across multinational corporations' global supply chains. Global Union Federations, {{as well as other}} global (World Company and Works Councils), regional (European Works Councils or European Industry Federations) and national <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>structures,</b> are parties to IFAs. Based on various features of international <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> activity, such as World Company Councils, codes of conduct, the trade and labour rights campaign or international social dialogue, IFAs constitute an important and innovative tool of international industrial relations. An analysis of the substantive and procedural provisions of IFAs leads to an analytical distinction between ‘rights' agreements and ‘bargaining’ agreements. The article assesses the substantive and procedural aspects of the 38 IFAs concluded before June 2005. Finally, key issues such as the scope of agreements, <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> capacity, and global supply chains are discussed in the context of international labour's campaigning, organising and negotiation activities.
