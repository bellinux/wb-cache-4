5|$|On June 8, 1789, Representative James Madison {{introduced}} nine {{amendments to}} <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> in the House of Representatives. Among his recommendations Madison proposed opening up <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> and inserting specific rights limiting {{the power of}} Congress in Article One, Section 9. Seven of these limitations would {{become part of the}} ten ratified Bill of Rights amendments. Ultimately, on September 25, 1789, Congress approved twelve articles of amendment to <b>the</b> <b>Constitution,</b> each consisting of one one-sentence paragraph, and submitted them to the states for ratification. Contrary to Madison's original proposal that the articles be incorporated into the main body of <b>the</b> <b>Constitution,</b> they were proposed as supplemental additions (codicils) to it. Articles Three through Twelve were ratified as additions to <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> on December 15, 1791, and became Amendments One through Ten of <b>the</b> <b>Constitution.</b> Article Two became part of <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> on May 5, 1992, as the Twenty-seventh Amendment. Article One is technically still pending before the states.|$|E
5|$|Section Eight {{describes}} {{processes for}} enforcing and amending <b>the</b> <b>Constitution.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Constitution</b> is the supreme {{law of the}} land, therefore other laws and edicts cannot conflict with it. If a conflict occurs, <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> applies. If <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> is not in conflict, but a law and a decree is, the law would be enforced.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Constitution</b> of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal is {{an ad hoc}} {{tribunal}} {{established by}} Article 100 of <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> of the Republic of Singapore. Article 100 was introduced into <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> by <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 2) Act 1994, which was passed by Parliament on 25 August 1994 and assented to by President Ong Teng Cheong on 14 September 1994. It came into force on 1 October 1994.|$|E
2500|$|Appointed {{legislature}}s: The {{legislature is}} partly elected and partly {{appointed by the}} executive. The appointed members of the legislature are sufficient to limit {{the power of the}} elected representatives. The prime minister is either a military leader or a figurehead of the military or the palace. [...] This includes <b>the</b> 1932 <b>constitution</b> (after 1937), <b>the</b> 1947 Charter, <b>the</b> 1949 <b>Constitution,</b> <b>the</b> 1952 <b>Constitution,</b> <b>the</b> 1968 <b>Constitution,</b> <b>the</b> 1974 <b>Constitution,</b> <b>the</b> 1978 <b>Constitution,</b> <b>the</b> 1991 <b>Constitution,</b> <b>the</b> 2007 <b>Constitution,</b> and <b>the</b> Pending 2016 <b>Constitution.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each of the United States {{has its own}} {{governing}} <b>Constitution.</b> <b>The</b> States <b>Constitutions</b> {{are usually}} longer and written in much more detail than <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Constitution.</b> For example, <b>the</b> Alabama <b>Constitution</b> has more than 600 pages and <b>the</b> New Jersey <b>Constitution</b> of 1947 is three times longer than <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Constitution.</b> <b>The</b> reason for this difference between <b>the</b> federal <b>Constitution</b> and <b>the</b> states <b>Constitutions</b> is what Justice Brennan called 'the new judicial federalism'. meaning that rights granted by <b>the</b> States <b>Constitutions</b> can be broader than those comprised by <b>the</b> federal <b>Constitution</b> but not narrowed.|$|R
50|$|Much of <b>the</b> PRC <b>Constitution</b> {{is modeled}} after <b>the</b> 1936 <b>Constitution</b> of <b>the</b> Soviet Union, {{but there are}} some {{significant}} differences. For example, while <b>the</b> Soviet <b>constitution</b> contains an explicit right of secession, <b>the</b> Chinese <b>constitution</b> explicitly forbids secession. While <b>the</b> Soviet <b>constitution</b> formally creates a federal system, <b>the</b> Chinese <b>constitution</b> formally creates a unitary multi-national state.|$|R

5|$|A {{referendum}} in Croatia {{can be called}} by the Parliament or the President on any issue falling within the purview of parliament, or on any other issue the president considers important to the independence, unity and existence of the republic. Since <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> was amended in 2001, parliament is obligated by <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> {{to call for a}} referendum if signatures of 10 percent of registered Croatian voters are collected. The signatures, by law, must be collected within a 15-day period. Referendums are regulated by Article 87 of <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> of Croatia which requires that the parliament passes an act on each referendum and that the outcome is binding unless the referendum is called as an advisory referendum.|$|E
5|$|Adams was {{concerned}} about the new Constitution and made an attempt to re-enter national politics. He allowed his name to be put forth as a candidate for the United States House of Representatives in the December 1788 election, but lost to Fisher Ames, apparently because Ames was a stronger supporter of <b>the</b> <b>Constitution,</b> a more popular position. Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for amendments to <b>the</b> <b>Constitution,</b> a movement that ultimately resulted in the addition of a Bill of Rights in 1791. Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of <b>the</b> <b>Constitution,</b> with these amendments and the possibility of more.|$|E

5|$|After Lukashenko {{assumed the}} {{presidency}} in 1994, he stated his intention to amend the recently passed Constitution. The amendments, according to Lukashenko, would expand {{the power of his}} office, marking a turning point in post-Soviet era politics in Belarus. A May 1995 national referendum was {{the first step in the}} amendment process. Out of the four questions, one asked if the president could disband parliament if the members violate national law. The vote, which several Supreme Soviet deputies protested, resulted in 77% in favor of the provision regarding the dismissal of the legislature by the president. Other questions on the ballot, such as the national flag and national emblem, didn't affect <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> as a whole, but their status has been decided by <b>the</b> <b>Constitution.</b> Two years later, Lukashenko scheduled the first referendum that would potentially alter <b>the</b> <b>Constitution.</b> The last referendum on <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> occurred in 2004, also scheduled by Lukashenko.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> of May 3, 1791, sejms {{were to be}} {{held every}} two years and last 70 days, with a {{provision}} for an extension to 100 days. Provisions for extraordinary sejms were made, {{as well as for}} a special constitutional sejm, which was to meet and discuss whether any revisions to <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> were needed (that one was to deliberate every 25 years).|$|E

5000|$|Half a {{millennium}} later, following the American Revolution, legislators looked to Magna Carta for inspiration, and emulated its [...] "law of the land" [...] language.

5000|$|<b>The</b> 1954 <b>Constitution</b> was {{replaced}} {{in the midst}} of the Cultural Revolution by <b>the</b> 1975 <b>Constitution</b> of <b>the</b> People's Republic of China. Books published in the PRC since the 1980s regarded the 1975 and 1978 promulgations of <b>the</b> <b>Constitutions</b> as ones with [...] "serious errors". In <b>the</b> 1954 <b>Constitution,</b> <b>the</b> President of the People's Republic of China (PRC) could convene Supreme National Meetings—emergency meetings. This Presidential right was never seen again in later promulgations of <b>the</b> Chinese <b>constitution.</b>|$|R
5|$|Article 14 of <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> of the Republic of Singapore, {{specifically}} Article 14(1), {{guarantees to}} Singapore citizens {{the rights to}} {{freedom of speech and}} expression, peaceful assembly without arms, and association. However, the enjoyment of these rights may be restricted by laws imposed by the Parliament of Singapore on the grounds stated in Article 14(2) of <b>the</b> <b>Constitution.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite the Government's unequivocal {{view that}} the right to vote is an implied {{constitutional}} right, in Singapore it is the courts that ultimately determine the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>Constitution.</b> Thio Li-ann has suggested that since the right's status {{is not likely to be}} brought before the courts in a dispute, the Cabinet should refer the matter to <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal pursuant to Article 100 of <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> for an authoritative opinion.|$|E
5|$|For <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> to be ratified, however, {{nine of the}} {{thirteen}} states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to ratification ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> in states where popular sentiment was against ratification (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> and call for {{the addition of a}} bill of rights. Four state conventions proposed some form of restriction on the authority of the new federal government to conduct searches.|$|E
