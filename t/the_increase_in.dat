This results in systematic group trends: as one goes down group18, the atomic radius, and with it the interatomic forces, increases, resulting in an increasing melting point, boiling point, enthalpy of vaporization, and solubility. <b>The</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> density is due to <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> atomic mass.|$|E

40|$|Xinjiang’s {{industrial}} sector {{accounted for more}} than 80 % of the total energy-related carbon emissions. A further understanding of each industrial sub-sector’s carbon intensity is very necessary to make differentiated policies and measures. This paper applied index decomposition analysis and attribution analysis to examine the influencing factors and each sub-sector’s contributions to the changes in influencing factors. The results demonstrated the following: (1) energy intensity effect contributed most to the decreases in industrial carbon intensity, and mining and quarrying, foods and tobacco, and other manufactures were the most representative industrial sub-sectors; (2) energy structure effect showed a positive effect on industrial carbon intensity, but its effect was not significant, and fuel processing, smelting and pressing of metals, metal products, and textile were mainly responsible for <b>the</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> energy structure effect; (3) industrial structure effect showed significant fluctuations, but its accumulative effect promoted <b>the</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> industrial carbon intensity, and fuel processing, mining and quarrying, and textiles were the main sub-sectors, which exerted negative effects on the decreases in industrial structure effect; (4) fuel processing, smelting and pressing of metals, and mining and quarrying significantly influenced these three decomposed factors from 2000 to 2014; (5) since 2009, energy-intensive sub-sectors <b>increased</b> rapidly, and <b>the</b> energy structure was not optimized, while attention was not paid to controlling the energy efficiency, thus all decomposed factors promoted <b>the</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> industrial carbon intensity; and (6) mining and quarrying, textiles, fuel processing, and transport equipment were primarily responsible for <b>the</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> energy structure effect. Fuel processing, chemicals, and smelting and pressing of metals were primarily responsible for <b>the</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> energy intensity effect.

40|$|The {{influence}} of hypertonic mannitol on regional myocardial blood flow and ventricular performance was studied during acute myocardial ischemia in awake, unsedated and in anesthesized dogs and after myocardial infarction in awake unsedated dogs. Regional myocardial blood flow {{was measured with}} radioactive microspheres. Generalized <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> regional myocardial blood flow occurred after mannitol {{in all of the}} different animal models studied. <b>The</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> coronary blood flow after mannitol were just as impressive in the nonischemic regions as in the ischemic portion of the left ventricle in all of the different models that were examined in this study. Improvement in regional myocardial blood flow to the ischemic area of the left ventricle after mannitol was associated with a reduction in ST segment elevation during acute myocardial ischemia <b>in</b> anesthetized dogs. <b>The</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> regional myocardial flow after mannitol were also associated with <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> contractility, but <b>the</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> flow appeared to be more impressive than the changes in contractility. The data obtained demonstrate that mannitol increases regional coronary blood flow to both ischemic and nonischemic myocardium in both anesthetized and awake, unsedated, intact dogs with acute and chronic myocardial ischemia and that mannitol reduces ST segment elevation during acute myocardial ischemia in anesthetized dogs. Thus the results suggest that under these circumstances <b>the</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> regional myocardial blood flow after mannitol are of physiological importance in reducing the extent of myocardial injury. Since coronary blood flow increased to nonischemic regions <b>the</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> regional myocardial flow demonstrated in this study after mannitol cannot be entirely explained by the mechanism of reduction in ischemic cell swelling...|$|R
