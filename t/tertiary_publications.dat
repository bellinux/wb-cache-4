40|$|Os mesmos equívocos que surgiram em torno da Documentação em seu relacionamento com a Biblioteconomia, começam a aparecer a respeito da Ciência da Informação e suas conexões com os dois campos que a precederam cronologicamente. Os três, entretanto, podem ser claramente delimitados quando examinados os objetivos específicos de cada um e os instrumentos que produzem. A Biblioteconomia lida com publicações primárias e seus usuários. A Documentação produz publicações secundárias e terciárias. E a Ciência da Informação estuda como, quando, porque e onde a informação aparece, quem a produz, qual o seu fluxo e destino final. A informática, entendida como processamento eletrônico da informação, está a serviço das três. É pena que os progressos da tecnologia computacional tenham transformado alguns bibliotecários, documentalistas e cientistas da informação em utopistas que anunciam uma "sociedade sem papel"; esquecidos de que os agentes de uma tal sociedade podem quebrar, um dia, todas as máquinas por eles mesmos criadas, como no romance Erewhon, de Samuel Butler. Information Science and Librarianship {{practice}}  AbstractThe same misunderstandings {{that were}} raised about Documentation and its relationships with Librarianship are now appearing {{with regard to}} Information Science and its connections with the two former areas. These three areas can however be clearly defined when the specific objectives of each of them and the instruments they produce are examined. Librarianship deals with primary publications and their users. Documentation produces secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>publications.</b> And Information Science studies how, when, why and where information originates, who produces it, its flow and final destination. Informatics, meaning the electronic processing of information, is {{at the service of}} these three areas. It is regrettable that the progress of computer technology have transformed some librarians, documentalists and information scientists in Utopians announcing a 'paperless society'. They forget that the agents of such society might one day break all the machines they have created as in Samuel Butler's novel Erewhon...|$|E

40|$|We are {{developing}} new OMICS based database for clinical research by integrating OMICS information and comprehensive clinical information. We are currently collecting hepatic, colon, and oral cancer. We have developed “Clinical Omics Database (iCOD) ” to store and analyze clinical omics data, which facilitates the understandings {{of relations between}} omics data and clinical data. This database has three components, 1) Primary database for anonimized data storage, 2) Secondary Database for research and analysis, 3) <b>Tertiary</b> database for <b>publication.</b> Publication database server can be accessed through the internet. In this database, the relationship is visualized as a network with three layers, clinical, pathological and omics layer, for each case. This {{would be the first}} public integrated clinical database including clinical information and molecular biological information. The target for this research is to realize “OMICS based Medicine ” and to understand the relation between pathobiology and clinical outcome...|$|R
30|$|Moreover, through {{analyzing}} global BIM {{education research}} trends, {{this study provides}} future research suggestions for academic BIM education across the globe. More detailed {{research needs to be}} conducted on delivering academic BIM education in different national contexts, AECO disciplines, and TES levels. More research on BIM educational frameworks and curriculum development needs to be done as well. Furthermore, our review and analysis of these <b>tertiary</b> BIM education <b>publications</b> highlight the relationship between academic BIM education and visualization: high visualization competencies in using 3 D to nD BIM have been {{recognized as one of the}} essential skillsets cultivated by academic BIM education across different AECO departments around the world. In fact, these visualization skills are being taught in different AECO schools across the globe currently. With the rapid diffusion of BIM in AECO education across the globe, advanced engineering communications through medium of visualization can be achieved and realized not only in academia but also in industry in the near future.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to conduct a {{statistical}} analysis to determine the outcome of conservative treatment after delivery of a first fetus in multiple pregnancy and thus define new prognostic factors. STUDY DESIGN: Multicentre retrospective study involving 12 centers over a 10 -year period. RESULTS: Twenty-eight twin pregnancies and seven triplet pregnancies which were managed conservatively. In twin pregnancies, 79 % of the delayed-delivery fetuses survived; only 7 % of the first delivered fetuses survived. The mean interval between deliveries was 47 days. No statistical difference was found concerning cerclage, antibiotic therapy, tocolysis and hospitalization. Earlier delivery of the first twin and premature rupture of membranes for the second twin were significantly related to a longer interval between deliveries. CONCLUSION: Delayed delivery in multifetal pregnancies can be successful if there are no contraindications and these pregnancies are managed in a <b>tertiary</b> perinatal center. <b>Publications</b> limited to successful cases have undoubtedly introduced some bias in assessment...|$|R
40|$|The What Works {{materials}} and programs were developed from {{a set of}} Strategic Results Projects (SRPs) conducted throughout Australia in the late 1990 s. There were two types of projects funded by the Commonwealth Government: capital projects, to upgrade the educational infrastructure of non-government providers; and ‘non-capital’ projects. The What Works project was about non-capital projects. The SRPs were about many things but, significantly, they were about ordinary people working together to achieve something new and exciting. The question that was asked initially and one that people submitting needed to address was: What changes to education and student support delivery practices will result in improved Indigenous learning outcomes within {{a relatively short period}} of time? The projects ranged in scale from small single-site operations to large systemic initiatives. Thirty-one projects operated at various sites and these sites ranged from inner urban areas of capital cities to remote outback areas. Basically, the SRPs were a series of experiments. The work was not conducted in exceptional circumstances; it was carried out in ordinary preschools, schools and training institutions, under conventional conditions. The process of discovery within the SRPs was not innovative; not different; not radical. The reason the SRPs worked was because people were choosing to make them do so, and these were mainly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community members, and teachers in schools, all of whom held a firm belief in the prospect of success and had the will to make it occur. They were effective school–community partnerships. It is almost certain that, sometime in their teaching careers, Australian teachers will have one or more Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander students in their classes. The full report of these projects could be read as a lengthy description of cases of good teaching practice; not especially exceptional, but applied with commitment and a determination to achieve success for all involved. Good relationships, trust, flexibility, individual concern, problem-solving, perseverance, thoughtful observation and careful investigation of good teaching strategies and possibilities, and knowledge of students’ backgrounds: that is what good teaching is. This is what teachers can do. The Report of the SRPs What Works: Improving outcomes for Indigenous students led to an Australian Government Program that has operated as training and development for schools for the past eight years, a program hosted by National Curriculum Services (NCS) and the Australian Curriculum Studies Association(ACSA). The project has produced the following publications: • What Works. The Work Program: Improving outcomes for Indigenous students. The Guidebook • What Works. The Work Program: Improving outcomes for Indigenous students. The Workbook • What Works. The Work Program: Improving outcomes for Indigenous students. CD-ROM • What Works. The Work Program: Improving outcomes for Indigenous students. Successful practice • What Works. The Work Program: Improving outcomes for Indigenous students. Website: www. whatworks. edu. au • Core Issue 1 – Setting up for success • Core Issue 2 – Reducing suspensions • Core Issue 3 – [English] Literacy for succeeding at school • Core Issue 4 – Numeracy • Core Issue 5 – Engagement • Core Issue 6 – Boarding • Core Issue 7 – International issues Between 2005 and October 2008 the program has conducted 950 professional learning activities involving 26, 130 participants. There has also been 102 presentations delivered to 7, 620 pre-service teachers in tertiary institutions. The project also recognised that this program and its attendant materials should be of interest to those engaged in pre-service university teacher education studies. To advance this over the past four years, three workshops of mostly Schools of Education staff have been held to introduce them to the program. These were facilitated by ACSA together with NCS. At these early meetings several possible semester courses were presented by Professor Paul Hughes of The University of South Australia, Senior Lecturer Simone Ilulka Tur of Flinders University, and Dr Kaye Price from the University of Canberra, based upon their experiences. At the last of these meetings other lecturers presented a number of extra ideas that related to possible course structures. This What Works <b>tertiary</b> <b>publication</b> is the outcome. ...|$|R
40|$|Aim The {{purpose of}} this review is to {{generate}} an inventory of issues that matter from a patient perspective in health research and quality of care. From these issues, criteria will be elicited to support patient(s) (groups) in their role as advisor or advocate when appraising health research, health policy and quality of health care. Background Literature shows that patients are beginning {{to develop their own}} voice and agenda's with issues in order to be prepared for the collaboration with professionals. Yet, patient issues have not been investigated systematically. This review addresses what patients find important and help to derive patient criteria for appraising research and quality of care. Methods/search strategy Information was gathered from Western countries with similar economic, societal and health-care situations. We searched (from January 2000 to March 2010) for primary sources, secondary sources and <b>tertiary</b> sources; non-scientific <b>publications</b> were also included. Results The international inventory of issues that were defined by patients is covering a large array of domains. In total, 35 issue clusters further referred to as criteria were found ranging from dignity to cost effectiveness and family involvement. Issues from a patient perspective reveal patient values and appear to be adding to professional issues. Conclusions Patient issues cover a broad domain, including fundamental values, quality of life, quality of care and personal development. Quite a few issues do not find its reflection in the scientific literature in spite of their clear and obvious appearance from tertiary sources. This may indicate a gap between the scientific research community and patient networks. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R
