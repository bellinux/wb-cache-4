In 1900, Hay negotiated a treaty with Denmark for the cession of the Danish West Indies. That treaty failed in the Danish parliament on a <b>tied</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meyer is {{challenged}} {{in the general}} election by Southern Senator Bill O'Brien. The election ends in an Electoral College tie, but with Meyer having won the popular vote. After an ambiguous result in Nevada, the Meyer camp successfully campaigns for a recount. The recount backfires, and O'Brien keeps Nevada as a victory, as well as overtakes the popular vote. Congress must then decide who will be the President. After the House of Representatives fails to elect the President, Meyer agrees to be Vice President for her running mate Tom James, however the Senate instead elects O'Brien's running mate Laura Montez as Vice President. Due to the <b>tied</b> <b>vote</b> in the House, the office of the President is left vacant, meaning that now as Vice President, Montez immediately ascends to the presidency. As a result, James makes plans to return to the private sector while Meyer, now completely out of office, contemplates her future.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} the referenda were binding, meaning the flag with the most votes in the second {{referendum}} was the official flag of New Zealand. If a new flag had been chosen, it would have come into effect {{six months after the}} second referendum result was declared, or earlier through an Order in Council declared by the Governor-General. In the unlikely event of a <b>tied</b> <b>vote,</b> an assumption for the status quo would have applied.|$|E

50|$|Although at {{a public}} {{referendum}} 1957 the line which advocated a mandatory system received most votes, the socials could not pass the issue because of a <b>tie</b> <b>vote.</b> But they put forward the proposition anyway. The <b>tie</b> <b>vote</b> was resolved by a MP (Ture Königson) for the Folkpartiet who abstained stating that he cannot vote against the pensioners, thereby passing the proposition.|$|R

25|$|Unlike most Senate Presidents {{that are}} the {{symbolic}} presiding officers of the upper house, the Senate President of the Philippines wields considerate power by influencing the legislative agenda and {{has the ability to}} vote not just in order to break ties, although the Senate President is traditionally the last senator to vote. A <b>tied</b> <b>vote,</b> therefore, means that the motion is lost, and that the Senate President cannot cast a tie-breaking vote since that would mean that the presiding officer would have had voted twice.|$|E
25|$|Twelve jurors decide by a {{qualified}} majority of two-thirds whether {{the defendant is}} guilty or not. A <b>tied</b> <b>vote</b> results in 'not guilty'; a '7 guilty - 5 not guilty' vote is transferred to the 3 professional judges who can, by unanimity, reverse the majority to 'not guilty'. The sentence is delivered by a majority of the 12 jurors and the 3 professional judges. As a result of the Taxquet ruling the juries give nowadays the most important motives that lead them to their verdict. The procedural codification has been altered to meet the demands formulated by the European Court of Human Rights.|$|E
25|$|By an {{amendment}} to the 1809 Instrument of Government, the general election of 1970 was the first to a unicameral assembly with 350 seats. The following general election to the unicameral Riksdag in 1973 only gave the Government the support of 175 members, while the opposition could mobilize an equal force of 175 members. In a number of cases a <b>tied</b> <b>vote</b> ensued, and the final decision had to be determined by lot. To avoid any reoccurrence of this unstable situation, the number of seats in the Riksdag was reduced to 349, from 1976 and onwards.|$|E

25|$|For {{both the}} 2018 and 2022 {{editions of the}} World Cup, the FIFA Executive Committee voted to decide which {{candidate}} should host the tournament. The multiple round exhaustive ballot system {{was used to determine}} the tournament host. All eligible members of the FIFA Executive Committee had one vote. The candidate country that received the fewest votes in each round was eliminated until a single candidate was chosen by the majority. In the event of a <b>tied</b> <b>vote,</b> FIFA President Sepp Blatter would have had the deciding vote. There are twenty-four members on the Committee, but two of those were suspended due to accusations of selling votes.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that in the late 1950s the IRFB was {{presented}} {{with the ideas of}} a world championship. In 1983 and 1984 respectively, the Australian and New Zealand Rugby Football Unions each proposed hosting such a tournament. The following year the board committed to conduct a feasibility study. A year later there was another meeting in Paris, and the Union subsequently voted on the idea. It was the South African Rugby Board's vote that proved to be crucial in setting up a <b>tied</b> <b>vote,</b> as they voted in favour, even though they knew they would be excluded due to the sporting boycott because of their apartheid policies. English and Welsh votes were then changed, and the vote was won 10 to 6.|$|E
500|$|For the 52nd Grammy Awards (2010), nominees included: Tia Carrere and Daniel Ho for He Nani, Amy Hanaiali'i for Friends & Family of Hawai'i, Ho'okena for Nani Mau Loa: Everlasting Beauty, and {{producers}} Ho, Kahumoku, Konwiser and Wong for Masters of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar: Volume 2. A <b>tied</b> <b>vote</b> {{for the fifth}} nominee resulted in only four nominated works. Family & Friends of Hawai'i contained vocal pop duets set to Matt Catingub's orchestral arrangements and reached a peak position of number three on Billboard Top World Albums chart. The album featured guests Dennis Kamakahi, Willie Nelson, and Keali'i Reichel, among others. The second volume of Masters of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar contained performances by falsetto vocalist Richard Ho'opi'i, steel guitarist Bobby Ingano, and slack-key players Kawika Kahiapo, Dennis Kamakahi, Sonny Lim, and co-producer Kahumoku. [...] Hanaiali'i and her brother Eric Gilliom performed during the awards ceremony, providing a [...] "mock opera lead-in" [...] for Jamie Foxx on the song [...] "Blame It". In addition to Ho, Kahumoku, Konwiser and Wong, awards were given to Peter deAquino, Ho and Sterling Seaton as the engineers/mixers. Guitarist Jeff Peterson joined the award winners on stage during the presentation. The win marked the fifth for a compilation album and the fourth to be co-produced by Ho. Konwiser and Wong became four-time award recipients, while Kahumoku (who was not credited as a producer of the 2006 award-winning compilation album) became a three-time recipient.|$|E

Upon returning to the game, Marty secured immunity in week 8 but was voted out as he had gained weight at the weigh-in, stripping him of his eligibility of immunity, and was subsequently re-eliminated. He also returned twice, returning again in week 10 after his second elimination, {{and went on to}} become a finalist.|$|E
2500|$|Gorton {{called a}} Liberal caucus meeting for 10 March 1971 {{to settle the}} matter. A motion of {{confidence}} in his leadership was tied. Under Liberal caucus rules of the time, a <b>tied</b> <b>vote</b> meant the motion was lost, and hence Gorton could have remained as party leader and Prime Minister without further ado. [...] However, he {{took it upon himself}} to resign, saying [...] "Well, that is not a vote of confidence, so the party will have to elect a new leader." [...] A ballot was held and McMahon was elected leader and thus Prime Minister. Australian television marked the end of Gorton's stormy premiership with a newsreel montage appropriately accompanied by Sinatra's anthem My Way.|$|E
