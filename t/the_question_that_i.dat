Alito stated that he had listed an affiliation with the group on his application to Ronald Reagan's Justice Department {{in order to establish}} his conservative credentials: [...] "You have to look at <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was responding to and the form that I was filling out... I was applying for a position in the Reagan administration. And my answers were truthful statements, but what I was trying to outline were the things that were relevant to obtaining a political position." [...] During the confirmation hearings, Alito disavowed the group, whose views were criticized as racist and sexist, saying: [...] "I disavow them. I deplore them. They represent things that I have always stood against and I can't express too strongly." [...] During Alito's Senate confirmation hearings, his wife, Martha Ann Alito, broke into tears after Republicans expressed their disapproval of how Alito was being characterized by some Democrats on the panel.|$|E

I practice as a negotiator, negotiation consultant, mediator and trainer in the skills of negotiation and mediation. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have been asking myself are: • What is my response when I wonder whether others are attempting to use adversarial or competitive ‘tactics’ to influence me in negotiation or the parties in mediation? • To what extent are such ‘tactics’ effective? • How can interest-based approaches deal with such ‘tactics’...|$|R
