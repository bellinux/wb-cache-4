5|$|The IgG {{antibodies}} form {{a complex}} with heparin and PF4 in the bloodstream. The <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antibody then binds to the FcγIIa receptor, a protein {{on the surface}} of the platelet. This results in platelet activation and the formation of platelet microparticles, which initiate the formation of blood clots; the platelet count falls as a result, leading to thrombocytopenia.|$|E

5|$|During {{the period}} 1868–1876, Sitting Bull {{developed}} {{into the most}} important of Native American political leaders. After the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) and the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation, many traditional Sioux warriors, such as Red Cloud of the Oglala and Spotted <b>Tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brulé, moved to reside permanently on the reservations. They were largely dependent for subsistence on the US Indian agencies. Many other chiefs, including members of Sitting Bull's Hunkpapa band such as Gall, at times lived temporarily at the agencies. They needed the supplies at a time when white encroachment and the depletion of buffalo herds reduced their resources and challenged Native American independence.|$|E
5|$|Least weasels {{from various}} parts of its range vary greatly in size. The body is slender and {{elongated}} and the legs and tail are relatively short. The colour varies geographically, as does the pelage type and length of tail. The dorsal surface, flanks, limbs and <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animal are usually some shade of brown while the underparts are white. The line delineating {{the boundary between the}} two colours is usually straight. At high altitudes and {{in the northern part of}} its range, the coat becomes pure white in winter. Eighteen subspecies are recognised.|$|E
5|$|Major nest predators include Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbirds (Cracticus spp.), {{laughing}} kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), currawongs (Strepera spp.), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.) {{as well as}} introduced mammals such as the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), cat (Felis catus) {{and black}} rat (Rattus rattus). Like other species of fairywrens, splendid fairywrens may use a 'rodent-run' display to distract predators from nests with young birds.

5|$|The body of {{the snake}} is subcylindrical, and is taller than it is wide. It has an upper surface that is {{typically}} a shade of blueish gray, while the belly is yellowish, with wide ventral scales that stretch from a third to {{more than half of}} the width of the body. Black rings of about uniform width are present throughout the length of the snake, but the rings narrow or are interrupted at the belly. The midbody is covered with 21 to 25 longitudinal rows of imbricate (overlapping) dorsal scales. The <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snake is paddle-shaped and adapted to swimming.|$|E

5|$|Tuatara {{reproduce}} very slowly, taking 10 to 20 {{years to}} reach sexual maturity. Mating occurs in midsummer; females mate and lay eggs once every four years. During courtship, a male makes his skin darker, raises his crests, and parades toward the female. He slowly walks in circles around the female with stiffened legs. The female will either submit, and allow the male to mount her, or retreat to her burrow. Males {{do not have a}} penis; they reproduce by the male lifting the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female and placing his vent over hers. The sperm is then transferred into the female, much like the mating process in birds.|$|E
5|$|As White had {{expected}} the survivors to {{fight their way}} out of Ngok Tavak, he made the decision to leave the dead allied soldiers behind; the decision caused distress amongst the survivors of the battle, but White believed evacuating the deceased soldiers through enemy lines would have been suicidal. After the Marines and Mobile Strike Force personnel had destroyed their unneeded equipment, they were directed to form an order-of-march out of Ngok Tavak, {{in order to protect the}} wounded and those with little infantry experience. Just before they left the garrison, Cameron blew up the first CH-46 helicopter that was still intact on the landing zone, using the M-72 anti-tank weapon. The order-of-march was led by a group of Nung soldiers, who were followed by White and the survivors of the Marine artillery detachment, and behind them was another group of Nung soldiers covering the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> column. Together they evaded VC formations surrounding the hill feature of Ngok Tavak and marched eastward towards Khâm Đức.|$|E
5|$|As the air {{ambulance}} prepares to land outside {{the emergency department}} a rotor blade is struck by a drone, causing the helicopter to crash land {{in the parking lot}} outside the hospital and into the back of an ambulance, causing the ambulance to knock scaffolding down over Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford). The <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helicopter smashes into the entrance of the emergency department causing brutal injuries. The department is shut down following the incident, with Connie and Grace’s lives prioritised. Grace is freed from the helicopter and taken into the department for treatment. Connie learns Grace has life-threatening injuries and may not survive surgery. The staff at Holby City come together to treat casualties of the accident. Grace survives surgery, but remains in a critical condition.|$|E
30|$|This study {{examined}} {{gender differences in}} variance and at <b>the</b> extreme <b>tails</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> score distribution in reading, mathematics and science. Ten databases from IEA and OECD PISA surveys were used to analyse such gender differences in an international perspective since 1995. The main results may be summarised in three points. (1) Gender differences vary by content area, students’ educational levels, and students’ proficiency levels. The gender differences at <b>the</b> extreme <b>tails</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution are often more substantial than the gender differences on the mean. (2) Exploring <b>the</b> extreme <b>tails</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distributions shows that <b>the</b> situation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weakest males in reading is a significant issue. In mathematics and science, males are more often the best-performing students. (3) The “greater male variability hypothesis” is confirmed.|$|R

5|$|Carolina wrens sing {{year round}} and {{at any point}} during the daytime, with the {{exception}} of performing during the most harsh weather conditions. The birds are also the only species in the Certhiidae family that neither sings in duet nor has their song control regions affect repertoire size. Males alone sing, and have a repertoire of at least twenty different phrase patterns and on average, thirty two. One of these patterns is repeated for several minutes, and although the male's song can be repeated up to twelve times, the general amount of songs range from three to five times in repetition. While singing, the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> birds is pointed downward. Some general vocalizations have been transcribed as teakettle-teakettle-teakettle and cheery-cheery-cheery. Various descriptions of the teakettle song include whee-udel, whee-udel, whee-udel, che-wortel, che-wortel and túrtee-túrtee-túrtee and familiar names and phrases such as sweet heart, sweet heart, come to me, come to me, sweet William, and Richelieu, Richelieu.|$|E
5|$|Early in the Savage's career, squadrons would {{typically}} deploy a detachment to Naval Air Station Port Lyautey, Morocco, {{for service}} with the Sixth Fleet and fly the bombers aboard aircraft carriers {{that were already}} deployed to the Mediterranean as needed. The plan was that the Savages would then be loaded with atomic bombs already aboard the carriers and launched once the carriers were in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The tactic to deliver the bombs was to fly at low level through Bulgaria and Romania before climbing at maximum power to the proper altitude to release the bomb. The aircraft would then perform a wingover maneuver and dive to low altitude, keeping the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft aimed at the target to avoid serious damage from the shock wave of the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Prichard was {{a talented}} cricketer, and played {{for a number}} of teams, {{including}} Hampshire, London County, and Marylebone Cricket Club. A right-arm fast bowler, he made his début in the first class game when he played for Hampshire against Somerset in the 1900 County Championship. He was not however a strong batsman, and would typically play in the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> batting order. He joined the short-lived London County in 1902, where he was a teammate of W. G. Grace. In 1903 he played his first of several games for The Gentlemen v The Players at Lords. He would be selected for The Gentleman three years in succession. In 1904, he joined the MCC, and took part in Lord Brackley's XI's tour of the West Indies in the 1904/5 season. In 1907, he toured the United States with the MCC.|$|E

5|$|In the Babylonian star {{catalogues}} {{dating from}} at least 1100 BCE, what later became known as Corvus was called the Raven (MUL.UGA.MUSHEN). As with more familiar Classical astronomy, it was placed sitting on the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Serpent (Greek Hydra). The Babylonian constellation was sacred to Adad, the god of rain and storm; in the second Millennium it would have risen just before the autumnal rainy season. John H. Rogers observed that Hydra signified Ningishzida, {{the god of the}} underworld in the Babylonian compendium MUL.APIN. He proposed that Corvus and Crater (along with Hydra) were death symbols and marked the gate to the underworld. These two constellations, along with the eagle Aquila and the fish Piscis Austrinus, were introduced to the Greeks around 500 BCE; they marked the winter and summer solstices respectively. Furthermore, Hydra had been a landmark as it had straddled the celestial equator in antiquity. Corvus and Crater also featured in the iconography of Mithraism, which is thought to have been of middle-eastern origin before spreading into Ancient Greece and Rome.|$|E
5|$|In the confusion, the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch line {{disintegrated}} into {{a chaotic}} melee, with eight British ships {{of the line}} fighting four Dutch and the frigate Monnikkendam. So close was the action that the British ships found themselves at risk of firing into {{one another in the}} high seas, heavy rain and poor visibility. The Dutch centre, consisting of the ships of the line Brutus, Leijden and the fifth rate razee Mars, pulled away from the engagement behind them under Rear-Admiral Johan Bloys van Treslong, coming under only distant fire from the ships of Onslow's division. Isolated, the Dutch rearguard were rapidly overwhelmed, with Jupiter, Haarlem, Alkmaar and Delft all surrendering to Onslow's attack before 13:45, while the battered Monnikkendam was seized by the frigate Beaulieu.|$|E
