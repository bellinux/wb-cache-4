40|$|We {{investigate}} a method {{designed to improve}} the accuracy of process mining in scenarios where the identification of task labels for log events is uncertain. Such situations are prevalent in business processes where events consist of communications between people, such as email messages. We examine how the accuracy of an independent <b>task</b> <b>identifier,</b> such as a classification or clustering engine, can be improved by examining the currently mined process model. First, a classification scheme based on identifying keywords in each message is presented to provide an initial labeling. We then demonstrate how these labels can be refined by considering {{the likelihood that the}} event represents a particular task as obtained via an analysis of the current representation of the process model. This process is then repeated a number of times until the model is sufficiently refined. Results show that both keyword classification and current process model analysis can be significantly effective on their own, and when combined have the potential to correct virtually all errors when noise is low (less than 20 %), and can reduce the error rate by about 85 % when noise is in the 30 - 40 % range.

40|$|We {{propose the}} use of formal {{languages}} of infinite words over the alphabet of <b>task</b> <b>identifiers</b> as an interface between control designs and software implementations. We argue that this approach is more flexible than the classical real-time scheduling framework based on periodic tasks, and allows composition of interfaces by language-theoretic operations. We show that finite automata over infinite words offer analyzable representation and can capture many interesting interface specifications such as exponential stability of switched linear systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this thesis, {{we focus}} on {{automatic}} coarse-grained composition of adaptive user interfaces relying on task trees. To achieve this goal we collect multiple user and context profiles from independent providers, and supply con-solidated profiles to independent decision makers (DMs) {{according to their own}} profile models. Each DM chooses the best-fit component for a given task ac-cording to the supplied user and context profile. To enable an unambiguous naming scheme for components across repositories we propose the notion of globally unique <b>task</b> <b>identifiers.</b> Selected components are downloaded from the repositories and are assembled into the finally delivered user interface. 1 Introduction & Related Work The term “adaptation ” in computer science refers to changing aspects of an interactive system to best fit individual users, based on their personal information and the context of use. This is very important nowadays as the ever-growing computer market targets an ever-widening set of users with different backgrounds, tastes and needs. Throug...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With version 3. 0, the OpenMP {{specification}} {{introduced a}} task construct {{and with it}} an additional dimension of concurrency. While offering a convenient means to express task parallelism, the new construct presents a serious challenge to event-based performance analysis. Since tasking may disrupt the classic sequence of region entry and exit events, essential analysis procedures such as reconstructing dynamic call paths or correctly attributing performance metrics to individual task region instances may become impossible. To overcome this limitation, we describe a portable method to distinguish individual task instances and to track their suspension and resumption with event-based instrumentation. Implemented {{as an extension of}} the OPARI source-code instrumenter, our portable solution supports C/C++ programs with tied tasks and with untied tasks that are suspended only at implied scheduling points, while introducing only negligible measurement overhead. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of the OpenMP specification to provide general support for <b>task</b> <b>identifiers</b> with untied <b>tasks.</b> ...|$|R

For example, a national library might be <b>tasked</b> with assigning <b>identifiers</b> to authors within its country, but this would lead to duplicate identifiers for authority data that describe transnational people.|$|R
40|$|Information and {{specifically}} Web pages may be organized, indexed, searched, and navigated using various metadata aspects, such as keywords, categories (themes), and also space. While categories and keywords {{are up for}} interpretation, space represents an unambiguous aspect to structure information. The basic problem of providing spatial references to content is solved by geocoding; a <b>task</b> that relates <b>identifiers</b> in texts to geographic co-ordinates. This work presents a methodology for the semiautomatic geocoding of persistent Web pages {{in the form of}} collaborative human intervention to improve on automatic geocoding results. While focusing on the Greek language and related Web pages, the developed techniques are universally applicable. The specific contributions of this work are (i) automatic geocoding algorithms for phone numbers, addresses and place name identifiers and (ii) a Web browser extension providing a map-based interface for manual geocoding and updating the automatically generated results. With the geocoding of a Web page being stored as respective annotations in a central repository, this overall mechanism is especially suited for persistent Web pages such as Wikipedia. To illustrate the applicability and usefulness of the overall approach, specific geocoding examples of Greek Web pages are presented. © 2008 ACM...|$|R
40|$|Workshop at Open Repositories 2014, Helsinki, Finland, June 9 - 13, 2014 Workshops and TutorialsORCID {{provides}} a means of uniquely and unambiguously identifying authors and contributors involved {{in the creation of}} materials in repositories. Worldwide, a number of universities are among the early adopters of ORCID and are planning to use ORCID data to maintain their institutional repositories. In the UK, the researcher <b>identifier</b> <b>task</b> group opted for ORCID as the best shared solution for researcher identifiers. Building on this, Jisc is conducting a pilot project to enable UK universities to explore the potential and take advantage of the identifier system provided by ORCID. The project will help to streamline the ORCID implementation process by producing case studies, guidance and recommendations which will be shared with the community. As part of this project, institutions will produce examples of how to implement ORCID in repository management practices and platforms. The aim of this session is to share information about the UK’s developing agreement on the use of ORCID for research systems and experiences, lessons learned and good practice of how ORCID can be implemented, supported and utilised in institutional repositories based on the examples of the Jisc ORCID pilot project which includes use in repositories and research information management systems.
