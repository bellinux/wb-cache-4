Alien pathogens could decimate the human population, which would have no immunity <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>or</b> they might use terrestrial livestock or plants as hosts, causing indirect harm to humans. Invasive organisms brought by extraterrestrial civilizations could cause great ecological harm because of the terrestrial biosphere's lack of defenses against them.|$|E

5|$|Trees {{have been}} venerated since time immemorial. To the ancient Celts, certain trees, {{especially}} the oak, ash and thorn, held special significance as providing fuel, building materials, ornamental objects and weaponry. Other cultures have similarly revered trees, often linking {{the lives and}} fortunes of individuals <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>or</b> using them as oracles.

25|$|The {{marriage}} contracts {{represented a}} {{protection for the}} women, {{both in terms of}} financial security if anything were to happen <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>or</b> their husband, and in terms of having the liberty to annul the promise of marriage if the man they had chosen proved incompatible. A substantial number of the filles du roi who arrived in New France between 1669 and 1671 cancelled marriage contracts; perhaps the dowry they had received made them disinclined to retain a fiancé with whom they found themselves dissatisfied.|$|E

25|$|Prose Sketch (Prosaskizze) – a brief {{outline of}} the {{dramatic}} action. Typically these sketches consisted {{of no more than}} a few paragraphs of prose, though Wagner sometimes added <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>or</b> modified them before proceeding to the next stage. This was the case with the sketches for the first three parts of the tetralogy. Exceptionally, however, Wagner (for reasons which will be explained later) never drafted a prose sketch for Götterdämmerung (or Siegfried's Tod, as it was originally called). The prose sketch for Act III of Die Walküre has disappeared.|$|E
25|$|A {{weapon that}} is part of the {{conventional}} military arsenal, but which has been taken up to great effect by insurgents, is the RPG. Two examples of an improvised weapon used by insurgents would be the improvised explosive devices used in Iraq and the Molotov cocktails (glass bottles filled with gasoline) used against vehicles and tanks. Two tactics used by many insurgents are assassinations and suicide bomb attacks. The latter tactic is used when an insurgent has a bomb strapped <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>or</b> in their car, which provides a low-tech way for insurgents to get explosives close to critical enemy targets.|$|E
25|$|Because the Israelites saw no shape when God {{spoke to}} {{them out of the}} fire at Horeb, Moses warned them not to make for {{themselves}} a sculptured image in any likeness whatever — the form of a man, woman, beast, bird, creeping thing, or fish. And when they looked up and saw the sun, moon, stars, and heaven, they were not to be lured into bowing down <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>or</b> serving them, for God allotted those things to other peoples, but God took the Israelites and brought them out of Egypt to be God's very own people.|$|E

25|$|Women were {{eventually}} {{admitted to the}} House of Lords in 1958. The Life Peerages Act passed that year permitted the creation of life baronies {{for both men and}} women on a regular basis. Hereditary peeresses were admitted in 1963 under the Peerage Act. The Peerage Act also permitted peers to disclaim hereditary peerages within a year of succeeding <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>or</b> within a year of attaining the age of majority. All eligible Scottish peers were permitted to sit in the House of Lords, and elections for representative peers ceased. Elections for Irish representative peers had already ended in 1922, when most of Ireland left the United Kingdom to become the Irish Free State.|$|E

25|$|The age {{of consent}} in Wisconsin is 18 {{and there is}} no close-in-age {{exception}}. There is, however, a marital exception which allows a person to have sex with a minor 16 or older if they are married to the minor. If the minor is below 16 both sexual intercourse and any sexual contact are a felony; sexual intercourse with a minor 16-17 by a perpetrator who is not married to the minor is a Class A misdemeanor. However, Wisconsin has a child enticement law that prohibits people of any age from taking people under 18 to a private area such as a room and exposing a sex organ <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>or</b> having the minor expose their sex organ to them. This is a Class B or C felony.|$|E

25|$|Comprehension is {{severely}} affected {{in patients with}} Wernicke’s aphasia. Wernicke’s area has been {{thought to be the}} center of language processing, specifically processing of meaning. While patients are still left with some comprehension, they are not able to repeat a sentence spoken <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>or</b> participate in an action requested by another speaker. A case study done by Ellis et al. discussed a patient who underwent several types of testing, one of which was a word-picture test. The conclusion of the test showed that while the patient understood what the image was, he had trouble retrieving the word and understanding the instructions. This case study suggests that it is language comprehension that is affected in Wernicke's aphasia and not a drop in intelligence.|$|E
25|$|The Roman Curia has {{two other}} tribunals which either deal with {{specialized}} cases or {{which do not}} deal with cases at all. The first is the Apostolic Signatura, a panel of five cardinals which serves as the highest court in the Roman Catholic Church. Normal cases rarely reach the Signatura, the exception being if a party appeals to the Pope and he assigns the case <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>or</b> if the Pope on his own initiative pulls a case from another court and gives it to them. The court mainly handles cases {{regarding the use of}} administrative power, including penal cases which were decided using executive instead of judicial power, which is the usual case. It also handles disputes between dicasteries and other tribunals over jurisdiction, complaints that a Rotal decision is null and should be retried, and matters regarding advocates and inter-diocesan tribunals.|$|E
25|$|Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWAS) are {{a recently}} developed research method {{which are used}} to examine genetic associations with dependence, addiction, and drug use. These studies employ an unbiased approach to finding genetic associations with specific phenotypes and give equal weight to all regions of DNA, including those with no ostensible relationship to drug metabolism or response. These studies rarely identify genes from proteins previously described via animal knockout models and candidate gene analysis. Instead, large percentages of genes involved in processes such as cell adhesion are commonly identified. This {{is not to say}} that previous findings, or the GWAS findings, are erroneous. The important effects of endophenotypes are typically not capable of being captured by these methods. Furthermore, genes identified in GWAS for drug addiction may be involved either in adjusting brain behavior prior to drug experiences, subsequent <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>or</b> both.|$|E
