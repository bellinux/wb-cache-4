40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} how different emotional abilities affect <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> task and relationship leaders in a group of 41 students. To conduct this investigation, leadership is envisioned as a dynamic network <b>of</b> leadership perceptions. <b>The</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> leadership and <b>the</b> role played by emotional abilities in this process are analyzed using Stochastic Actor Oriented Models (SAOMs). The results suggest that emotional abilities play complementary roles in emergent leadership. Whereas the abilities to perceive and manage emotions facilitate <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> relationship leaders, <b>the</b> abilities to use and understand them facilitate <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> task leaders.

40|$|Two {{decades of}} {{attempts}} to model <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> language as a collective cognitive activity have demonstrated a number of principles {{that might have been}} part of the historical process that led to language. Several models have demonstrated <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> structure in a symbolic medium, but none has demonstrated <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capacity for symbolic representation.

An analysis of embodied interaction among captive, but not human-enculturated, bonobo chimpan-zees reveals a number of additional features of embodiment that are relevant to <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> symbolic language, but that have not yet been explored in computational simulation models; for example, complementarity of action in addition to imitation, iconic in addition to indexical gesture, coordination among multiple sensory and perceptual modalities, and the orchestration of intra- and inter-individual motor coordination.
