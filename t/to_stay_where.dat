The battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel des Voeux, out of contact with brigade headquarters, decided <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> they were for the night and continue the advance in daylight.|$|E
5|$|In 1124, {{just before}} the final conquest of the Liao dynasty, a group of Khitans led by Yelü Dashi fled {{northwest}} to the border area and military garrison of Kedun (Zhenzhou), in modern-day northern Mongolia. Yelü Dashi convinced the people there, around 20,000 Liao cavalry and their families, to follow him and attempt to restore the Liao dynasty. Yelü Dashi proclaimed himself emperor in 1131, after which he moved further west into modern Kazakhstan and then occupied the Karakhanid city of Balasaghun (in modern Kyrgyzstan). After a failed attempt in 1134 to reclaim the territory formerly held by the Liao, Dashi decided instead <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> he was and establish a permanent Khitan state in Central Asia. The state, known as the Qara Khitai or the Western Liao dynasty, controlled several key trading cities, was multicultural, and showed evidence of religious tolerance. The state survived {{for nearly a century}} before being conquered by the Mongol Empire in 1218.|$|E
25|$|Halberstam's {{reputation}} {{spread throughout}} Romania and Hungary, and even reached Israel. In 1937 Halberstam {{was offered a}} seat on the Jerusalem rabbinical court. Uncertain as to whether he should accept the seat or stay with his community, Halberstam wrote to his mother in Rudnik for advice. She advised him <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> he was, saying he was too young to accept such a position.|$|E

While {{becoming}} a [...] "contraband" [...] {{did not mean}} full freedom, many slaves found it preferable <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>where</b> they were. The day after Butler's decision, many more escaped slaves {{found their way to}} Fort Monroe and appealed for [...] "contraband" [...] status. The area attracted those slaves who could escape, which included determined families and women with children.|$|R

25|$|Breast cancer, {{like other}} cancers, occurs {{because of an}} {{interaction}} between an environmental (external) factor and a genetically susceptible host. Normal cells divide {{as many times as}} needed and stop. They attach to other cells and stay in place in tissues. Cells become cancerous when they lose their ability to stop dividing, to attach to other cells, <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> they belong, and to die at the proper time.|$|E
25|$|When {{the monastic}} Elders {{living in the}} desert heard about Simeon, who had chosen a new and strange form of asceticism, they wanted to test him to {{determine}} whether his extreme feats were founded in humility or pride. They decided to order Simeon under obedience to {{come down from the}} pillar. They decided that if he disobeyed, they would forcibly drag him to the ground, but if he was willing to submit, they were to leave him on his pillar. St Simeon displayed complete obedience and humility, and the monks told him <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> he was.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} wave of the expulsion, most Acadian exiles were {{assigned}} to rural communities in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and South Carolina. In general, they refused <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> they were put and large numbers migrated to the colonial port cities where they gathered in isolated, impoverished French-speaking Catholic neighbourhoods, the sort of communities Britain's colonial officials tried to discourage. More worryingly for the British authorities, some Acadians threatened to migrate north to French-controlled regions, including the Saint John River, Île Royale, the coasts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Canada. Because the British believed their policy of sending the Acadians to the Thirteen Colonies had failed, they deported the Acadians to France during the second wave of the Expulsion.|$|E

25|$|Resting {{in their}} hide {{for the next}} day, the commandos went over their plan of attack and {{withdrawal}} from the area. They left their hideout at 20:00 on 17 September to start their attack on the power plant. On their approach they detected a small craft on the fjord; fearing they would lose {{the element of surprise}} if seen, they retreated back up the hill. By dawn they {{had not been able to}} reach their previous hideout; while they were in an exposed location they decided <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> they were until that night. The commandos had by now started to run short of supplies, and Captain Black ordered the attack to proceed that night, 19/20 September, no matter what.|$|E
500|$|Giving {{evidence}} {{over three}} days, Harwood said that Tomlinson [...] "just {{looked as if}} he was going <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> he was forever and was almost inviting physical confrontation in terms of being moved on." [...] He said he had not warned Tomlinson and had acted because Tomlinson was encroaching a police line, which amounted to a breach of the peace. The court heard that Tomlinson's last words after collapsing were, [...] "they got me, the fuckers got me"; he died moments later. On 3 May 2011 the jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing, ruling that the officer—Harwood was not named for legal reasons—had used excessive and unreasonable force in hitting Tomlinson, and had acted [...] "illegally, recklessly and dangerously." ...|$|E

[...] He refused morphia and against all advice returned to the front lines, deciding that he [...] "wasn't wounded enough <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> [...] was". [...] On the following day his eardrums burst from the constant firing and barrage, but he was content to stuff his ears with bandages and continue fighting. [...] On Sunday 24th, shortly after a truce to allow the evacuation of casualties, Cain was alerted to the approach of a Tiger tank. Together with a Royal Artillery gunner he raced for a 6 pounder anti-tank gun, manoeuvred it into position, fired and disabled the tank. [...] He wanted to continue using the gun, but the recoil mechanism was destroyed.|$|E

500|$|The pro-Church accounts, by contrast, {{described}} a boy very much resolved <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> he was, and horrified by his mother's exhortations {{to return to}} the Judaism of his ancestors. In this narrative, the main reason for the Mortaras' grief was not that their son had been taken, but that he now stood to grow up in the Christian faith. According to La Civiltà Cattolica, Marianna flew into a rage on seeing a medallion hanging from Edgardo's neck bearing the image of the Virgin Mary, and ripped it off; one article {{went so far as to}} claim the Jewish mother had done this with the words: [...] "I'd rather see you dead than a Christian!" [...] Some of the Church's critics had charged that by keeping Edgardo, it was violating the commandment that a child should honour his father and mother—La Civiltà Cattolica countered that Edgardo still loved his family despite their religious differences and indeed, after being taught by the priests to read and write, had chosen to write his first letter to his mother, signing it [...] "your most affectionate little son". Louis Veuillot, the ultramontane editor of the L'Univers newspaper and one of the Pope's staunchest defenders, reported after meeting Edgardo in Rome that the boy had told him [...] "that he loves his father and his mother, and that he will go to live with them when he is older... so that he can speak to them of Saint Peter, of God, and of the most Holy Mary." ...|$|E

Mayor David Miller did not favour the proposal either, stating that there were other, higher priorities. The proposal did not come to Council for discussion and vote.|$|E

The first PAVN unit to enter the city was the 324th Division. By daybreak, it was obvious that the ARVN's position was untenable. [...] At 10:24, Minh announced an unconditional surrender.
