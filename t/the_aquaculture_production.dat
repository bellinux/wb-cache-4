50|$|Increasingly, {{these fish}} are being breed artificially for aquaculture. This {{is a common}} {{practice}} in Lao PDR and Thailand. In order to capture wild fish, aquaculture sites set up large-mesh gill netting at spawning sites. Not only does this capture many wild Jullien’s golden carp, but it also stops them from spawning, further diminishing their numbers. The Fisheries Department in Batu Berendam, Malacca in Malaysia are developing and applying spawning techniques through its Fresh Water Fisheries Research Centre. The economic component of this project is paramount, {{with the goal of}} the project to increase <b>the</b> <b>aquaculture</b> <b>production</b> target to 200,000 tons of fish by 2010. As of 2012, this number has been greatly surpassed and there are now approximately 2.5 million metric tons of fish, including the Jullien’s golden carp, being harvested per year. The value of this harvest is estimated at $3.6 to 6.5 billion USD. The goal of this project is to boost production of freshwater fish, creating more of a commodity that is valued by consumers. This means that little effort is being made to preserve the endangered species of fish they are breeding, such as the Jullien’s golden carp.|$|E

30|$|Fisheries and aquafarms {{located in}} coastal seas can be {{influenced}} by terrestrial inputs, such as freshwater, nutrients, and momentum through inflow from rivers (Kimmerer [2002]). Aquacultures operate mainly in coastal oceans and currently contribute approximately 48 % of the aquatic animal food for human consumption (FAO [2011]; Bondad-Reantaso et al. [2012]). The fish and shellfish populations of coastal seas are also influenced by the input of terrestrial nutrients through submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) (Liu et al. [2011]; Nakada et al. [2011]). Large snowmelt runoffs, along with high nutrient fluxes, can affect fishery production in coastal oceans. However, no study has yet investigated how snowmelt runoff influences <b>the</b> <b>aquaculture</b> <b>production</b> in coastal oceans. Estimation of nutrient loading through rivers and SGDs around the snowmelt season is essential to investigate the role of snowmelt runoff in fishery production.|$|E
