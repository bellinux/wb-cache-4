5|$|Emphasis {{is placed}} not on actual {{arithmetic}} computation, {{but rather on}} conceptual understanding and interpretation. The course curriculum is organized around four basic themes; the first involves exploring data and covers 20–30% of <b>the</b> <b>exam.</b> Students are expected to use graphical and numerical techniques to analyze distributions of data, including univariate, bivariate, and categorical data. The second theme involves planning and conducting a study and covers 10–15% of <b>the</b> <b>exam.</b> Students {{must be aware of}} the various methods of data collection through sampling or experimentation and the sorts of conclusions that can be drawn from the results. The third theme involves probability and its role in anticipating patterns in distributions of data. This theme covers 20–30% of <b>the</b> <b>exam.</b> The fourth theme, which covers 30–40% of <b>the</b> <b>exam,</b> involves statistical inference using point estimation, confidence intervals, and significance tests.|$|E

The multiple choice portion of <b>the</b> <b>exam</b> consists of forty questions with five possible answers each. The free response section contains six open-ended questions that are often long and divided into multiple parts.

The sixth question consists of a broad-ranging investigative task and may require approximately twenty-five minutes to answer.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} to Civil War Union General John Sedgwick {{stands on the}} outskirts of the Plain. Sedgwick's bronze statue has spurs with rowels that freely rotate. Legend states that if a cadet is in danger of failing a class, they are to don their full-dress parade uniform the night before the final exam. The cadet visits the statue and spins the rowels at the stroke of midnight. Then the cadet runs back to the barracks as fast as he or she can. According to legend, if Sedgwick's ghost catches them, they will fail <b>the</b> <b>exam.</b> Otherwise the cadet will pass <b>the</b> <b>exam</b> and the course. Although being out of their rooms after midnight is officially against regulations, violations have been known to be overlooked for the sake of tradition.|$|E

It was also said that he was revelling in the situation and was acting very aggressively. Saari encountered little resistance, and the massacre was concluded relatively quickly.

5|$|The Matriculation exam tested {{candidates}} on five subjects: Latin, Greek, Mathematics, Science, and English Literature. By exam-time this dedication to his studies had paid off spectacularly; the 1887 Cape lists placed Jan third overall, {{with the highest}} marks in the Colony in Greek. In what had been by any standards a year of tremendous success the latter achievement was especially outstanding; a misunderstanding {{at the start of}} the year led Jan to believe that he would be exempted from the Greek exam – as a result it was a subject which he largely disregarded. Six days before <b>the</b> <b>exam</b> this potentially devastating oversight was exposed – there was now less than a week in which to catch up with a year’s study. Jan immediately shut himself away in his rooms, spending the next days in total seclusion, working from sunrise to sunset in the attempt to master the grammar and vocabulary upon which he was shortly to be tested. By the time of <b>the</b> <b>exam</b> this hard work had paid off. Within a relatively short period Jan had largely memorised his books and had mastered the Greek language to a remarkable degree.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Drinking alcohol during <b>the</b> <b>exams</b> {{can affect}} {{academic}} performance and future career options, but is rarely investigated. Drinking motives, socio-demographics and personality characteristics are investigated in non-abstainers and weekly drinkers during <b>the</b> <b>exams.</b> Participants: 7, 181 Belgian university students who anonymously responded to an email invitation to an online survey. Methods: Logistic regressions and mixed design analysis-of-variance on cross-sectional data. RESULTS: One-third of the students continued drinking during <b>the</b> <b>exams,</b> with 40 % drinking weekly. Non-abstainers were mainly male, elder, internally motivated when drinking, and housed with parents or independently. Weekly drinkers were similar, except mainly housed in student apartments or independently. Personality characteristics were non-significant. All drinking motives were less pronounced during <b>the</b> <b>exams,</b> with smaller differences for internal motives. Conclusions: Mainly linked to internal drinking motives, drinking during <b>the</b> <b>exams</b> in higher education is underestimated. The characteristics and motives of students doing so {{can be used in}} future interventions...|$|R

However, some were able to use rowing boats as a means of escape. Saari started fires at several other locations within the school buildings, and the fire in <b>the</b> <b>exam</b> room damaged some of the bodies so badly that they had to be identified from DNA and dental records. Nine of the victims were found in <b>the</b> <b>exam</b> room, and one in a nearby corridor. It was later ascertained that this student had fled the burning classroom and then died in the corridor. Eight of the victims were female students, one a male student, and one a male member of staff. All of the students killed were in their 20s, and the teacher was in his 50s. A 21-year-old woman was shot in the head but had two operations in the days after sustaining her injury, and was reported as being in a satisfactory condition. A further ten students were treated for minor injuries including sprains and cuts from broken glass. All the victims were classmates of Saari's. Saari was originally from Pohjois-Pohjanmaa, but lived in Kauhajoki where he was enrolled on his catering course at the college. It was later revealed that the male student was probably a close friend of Saari's. The pair had spent an evening out together in February 2008 when they were threatened with a starter pistol. A photo of them together had been circulating on the Internet, in which Saari jokingly points at his friend's head with his forefinger. The names of the other victims were withheld by police.|$|E
