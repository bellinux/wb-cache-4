In this paper, we investigate joint power control, channel assignment and radio interface selection for robust provisioning of link bandwidth in infrastructure multiradio multi-channel(MR-MC) wireless networks in presence of channel variability and external interference. To characterize the logical relationship between spatial contention constraints and power control, we formulate the joint power control and radio-channel assignment as a generalized disjunctive programming problem. The generalized Benders decomposition techniques is applied to decompose the radio-channel assignment (combinatorial constraints) and network resource allocation(continuous constraints) so that the problem can be solved efficiently. The proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution within a finite number of iterations. We have evaluated our scheme using traces collected from a wireless mesh testbed and simulation studies in Qualnet. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is superior to existing schemes in providing larger interference margin, and reducing outage and packet loss probabilities. ...|$|E

We also identify topology patterns that result inMOAS prefixes and use them to classify these events.

40|$|Abstract—Network {{topology}} plays {{a critical}} role while de-signing and evaluating network protocols. Most existing topology generators are insufficient to reflect the real world network demands to a topology or to capture the Internet topology evolution such as the “flattening ” Internet. They focused on the graph properties of a topology, thus, lacking of ability to model engineering features of the network. Some state-of-art topology generators that consider engineering factors fail to capture trends in both intra-AS and inter-AS connections, which are equally important for evaluating future network protocols. We have developed a topology generator GeoTopo, which is to our best knowledge the first scalable <b>topology</b> generator modeling <b>engineering</b> factors for both intra-AS and inter-AS <b>topology</b> generation. The <b>engineering</b> factors that GeoTopo considers include demographic and geographic features as well as business interests of ASes. We use GeoTopo to create and study three classes of topologies: the topology characterized mainly by graph-properties (Status Quo topology), the topology driven by peering at Internet Exchange Points (IXP topology) and the topology characterized by country backbones (CB topology). The SQ topology follows the degree-based model {{and serves as a}} baseline for capturing topology features. The IXP and CB topologies model two major directions of the Internet “flattening”. The three classes of topologies enable us to analyze the impact of <b>engineering</b> factors on <b>topology</b> generation such as AS peering policies, IXP deployment and AS geo-settings. GeoTopo’s ability to generate projected future Internet topologies make it a valuable tool for the design and evaluation of Future Internet Architectures that is currently under considera-tion in the research community. We use the evaluation of Global Name Resolution Service (GNRS), a key component shared by name-based network architectures, as an example application to demonstrate GeoTopo’s capability to capture the mobility of network entities, the locality of the traffic, and the impact of the evolving network.

40|$|Understanding of {{the effects}} of the {{backbone}} cyclization on the structure and dynamics of a protein is essential for using protein <b>topology</b> <b>engineering</b> to alter protein stability and function. Here we have determined, for the first time, the structure and dynamics of the linear and various circular constructs of the N-SH 3 domain from protein c-Crk. These constructs differ in the length and amino acid composition of the cyclization region. The backbone cyclization was carried out using intein-mediated intramolecular chemical ligation between the juxtaposed N- and the C-termini. The structure and backbone dynamics studies were performed using solution NMR. Our data suggest that the backbone cyclization has little effect on the overall three-dimensional structure of the SH 3 domain: besides the termini, only minor structural changes were found in the proximity of the cyclization region. In contrast to the structure, backbone dynamics are significantly affected by the cyclization. On the subnanosecond time scale, the backbone of all circular constructs on average appears more rigid than that of the linear SH 3 domain; this effect is observed over the entire backbone and is not limited to the cyclization site. The backbone mobility of the circular constructs becomes less restricted with increasing length of the circularization loop. In addition, significant conformational exchange motions (on the sub-millisecond time scale) were found in the N-Src loop and in the adjacent β-strands in all circular constructs studied in this work. These effects of backbone cyclization on protein dynamics have potential implications for the stability of the protein fold and for ligand binding...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} band {{structure}} <b>topology</b> and <b>engineering</b> from {{the interplay between}} local moments and itinerant electrons {{in the context of}} pyrochlore iridates. For the metallic iridate Pr$_ 2 $Ir$_ 2 $O$_ 7 $, the Ir $ 5 d$ conduction electrons interact with the Pr $ 4 f$ local moments via the $f$-$d$ exchange. While the Ir electrons form a Luttinger semimetal, the Pr moments can be tuned into an ordered spin ice with a finite ordering wavevector, dubbed "Melko-Hertog-Gingras" state, by varying Ir and O contents. We point out that the ordered spin ice of the Pr local moments generates an internal magnetic field that reconstructs the band structure of the Luttinger semimetal. Besides the broad existence of Weyl nodes, we predict that the magnetic translation of the "Melko-Hertog-Gingras" state for the Pr moments protects the Dirac band touching at certain time reversal invariant momenta for the Ir conduction electrons. We propose the magnetic fields to control the Pr magnetic structure and thereby indirectly influence the topological and other properties of the Ir electrons. Our prediction may be immediately tested in the ordered Pr$_ 2 $Ir$_ 2 $O$_ 7 $ samples.

40|$|Abstract—Today, Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) already {{represents}} 60 {{percent of}} Internet traffic. Although P 2 P users {{are a good}} source for revenue for Internet Service Providers (ISPs), the data volume caused by P 2 P poses a significant challenge to ISPs regarding traffic engineering. Because P 2 P routing is usually agnostic of the underlying <b>topology,</b> traffic <b>engineering</b> abilities of ISPs are inhibited. This problem is known as mismatching problem between the logical P 2 P overlay topology and the underlying physical network topology. To mitigate this problem and, e. g., to avoid traffic congestions, the concept for a new mechanism is proposed in this paper. P 2 P users are provided with accurate information on the hop counts to other peers to select close peers in unstructured P 2 P networks. This mechanism does neither require a modification of the construction algorithm for unstructured P 2 P networks nor create any communication overhead. Already in the access network, the original Time-To-Live (TTL) value of outgoing IP packets is copied and inserted as IP option into these packets by the network operator. At the traffic destination, the hop count for an IP packet is calculated as {{the difference between the}} copied TTL value and the TTL value of the IP header. Using the hop count, a relationship between the logical overlay and the physical network is established to do traffic engineering...|$|R

40|$|Phased array antennas {{require a}} {{distance}} of the array elements to be smaller than half a wavelength {{in order to avoid}} grating lobes while scanning through the whole visible space. In the case of planar dual- or multi-band antenna arrays, the capability of wide-angle scanning at the operational bands defines strict constraints on the electrical inter-element spacings, especially at the low frequency band. For patch antenna arrays, these requirements lead to the formation of closely-spaced antenna elements and thus, increased levels of mutual coupling. This thesis aims firstly on understanding the physics of mutual coupling phenomenon between closely-packed patch antenna elements by investigating the behavior of different field/power components that are associated with the space, surface and total waves obtained from some simplified analytical models of patch antennas. The second aim of the thesis is to decrease mutual coupling between antenna elements by using dielectric contrast techniques. To reach this aim, different vertical/lateral dielectric stratifications inside the homogeneous substrate have been investigated and applied to reduce the mutual coupling while having no negative impact on the scanning performance, radiation pattern characteristics or radiation efficiencies. The performance of the MATLAB-based mathematical model has been evaluated both via theoretical analysis and FEKO/CST simulations. The simple model has shown great potential to explain the origins of mutual coupling and to be used for optimization purposes in the vertical stratification technique. More detailed analysis and optimization have been performed in CST {{in order to understand the}} limits and capabilities of vertical/lateral dielectric stratification. The results of the simulations have shown that by proper selection of the position, permittivity and thickness of the additional high-permittivity layer, it is possible to achieve satisfactory performances in terms of mutual coupling for E-plane arrays. Furthermore, a novel four-layer substrate design has been proposed that combines high and low permittivity layers and is able to decrease mutual coupling in E-plane while improving the efficiency without any need to redesign the array <b>topology.</b> Electrical <b>Engineering,</b> Mathematics and Computer ScienceMicrowave Sensing, Signals and System...|$|R
40|$|<b>Topology</b> {{optimization}} of <b>engineering</b> structures {{has long}} been a topic of research scrutiny. Many methods have been successfully developed for the determination of continuum structures. Some of these techniques, for example the homogenous method, have also been adapted for use with discrete structural frames or trusses. Most commonly the topology optimization of truss structures is carried out {{with the aid of a}} ground structure, a simple raster that describes potential joint locations. Although this simplifies the computation, it greatly limits the range of potential solutions that fit the gridded raster. Additionally, when using Evolutionary Computation (EC) methods, the level of computational intensity increases exponentially with the size of the ground structure making anything above a very modest level of complexity impractical to process. This paper demonstrates several practical techniques that can be used with EC, and more specifically Genetic Algorithms, when applied to topology exploration of discrete structures. First a method of chromosome coding that avoids the use of ground structures is shown. Then specific genetic recombination techniques are illustrated that are well suited for breeding different topologies. The combined techniques are demonstrated in a topology design problem. The paper concludes with a discussion of advantages of EC over traditional optimization methods in the area of overall form design...|$|R
40|$|Topological Optimization {{provides}} a powerful framework {{to obtain the}} optimal domain <b>topology</b> for several <b>engineering</b> problems. The topological derivative is a function which characterizes the sensitivity of a given problem to the change of its topology, like opening a small hole in a continuum or changing the connectivity of rods in a truss. A numerical approach for the topological optimization of 2 D and 3 D linear elastic problems using Boundary Elements is presented in this work. The topological derivative is computed from strain and stress results which are solved {{by means of a}} standard Boundary Element analysis. Models are discretized using linear or constant elements and a periodic distribution of internal points over the domain. The total potential energy is selected as cost function. The evaluation of the topological derivative is performed as a post-processing procedure. Afterwards, material is removed from the model by deleting the internal points and boundary nodes with the lowest values of the topological derivate. The new geometry is then remeshed using algorithms capable of detecting “holes ” at those positions where internal points and boundary points have been removed. The procedure is repeated until a given stopping criterion is satisfied. The proposed strategy proved to be flexible and robust.

40|$|Increasing {{electricity}} consumption significantly affects all nations from environmental, social, and economic perspectives. Among the contributors {{to this problem}} is rising power consumption of the Internet’s backbone network due to expanding Internet traffic volumes. This thesis addresses the power consumption minimization problem of the Internet's backbone network. Existing solutions to reduce power consumption are identified and categorized into four approaches of network redesign, traffic engineering, power-aware networking, and load-adaptive operation. Network redesign solutions either modify core nodes by incorporating advanced devices or optimize the physical link <b>topology.</b> Traffic <b>engineering</b> solutions aggregate multiple traffic flows into fewer streams using wavelength/waveband grooming. Power-aware networking solutions vary the operating states of network devices according to traffic variability. Load-adaptive operation solutions use high-rate network devices with Mixed Line Rates (MLR) to serve traffic. To reduce power consumption of an Optical Circuit Switched (OCS) network, each chapter derives solutions from one or more approaches. First, network redesign and traffic engineering solutions are combined to develop a novel sparse grooming algorithm. The proposed algorithm selectively places core routers to reduce power consumption by 688 kW over a traditional network. Second, network redesign and power-aware networking solutions are integrated to develop two novel strategies that use different algorithms to reduce cost and power consumption of a survivable network. Cost is reduced by 40 % and power consumption is reduced by 1. 3 MWh in a day. Third, the effect of grouping policy and band size and configuration design parameters on power consumption of a waveband-groomed network is analyzed. Proposed algorithms show that power consumption of this Band Switched Network (BSN) can be reduced in different traffic environments by using specific design parameters. Fourth, traffic engineering and load-adaptive operation solutions are combined to develop three new schemes and two algorithms that assign line rates and wavelengths/wavebands in the network, respectively. Power consumption of this MLR-based BSN reduces by 80 % and 17 % over two Single Line Rate (SLR) -based traditional networks. Lastly, solutions from network redesign and power-aware networking are integrated to develop a novel burst assembly scheme that reduces power consumption of a sleep-mode-enabled Optical Burst Switched (OBS) network by approximately 0. 5 kW than when traditional schemes are used...|$|R
40|$|Work on dynamic <b>topology</b> {{optimization}} of <b>engineering</b> {{structures for}} vibration suppression has mainly addressed the maximization of eigenfrequencies and gaps between consecutive eigenfrequencies of free vibration, minimization {{of the dynamic}} compliance subject to forced vibration, and minimization of the structural frequency response. A dynamic topology optimization method of bimaterial plate structures is presented based on power flow analysis. Topology optimization problems formulated directly with the design objective of minimizing the power flow response are dealt with. In comparison to the displacement or velocity response, the power flow response takes not only the amplitude of force and velocity into account, but also the phase relationship of the two vector quantities. The complex expression of power flow response is derived based on time-harmonic external mechanical loading and Rayleigh damping. The mathematical formulation of topology optimization is established based on power flow response and bimaterial solid isotropic material with penalization(SIMP) model. Computational optimization procedure is developed by using adjoint design sensitivity analysis and the method of moving asymptotes(MMA). Several numerical examples are presented for bimaterial plate structures with different loading frequencies, which verify the feasibility and effectiveness of this method. Additionally, optimum results between topological design of minimum power flow response and minimum dynamic compliance are compared, showing that the present method has strong adaptability for structural dynamic topology optimization problems.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe {{impetus for}} this {{research}} is the well-documented current inability of Higher Education to facilitate the level of problem solving required in 21 st century engineering practice. The research contends that there is insufficient {{understanding of the nature}} of and relationship between the significantly different forms of disciplinary knowledge underpinning engineering practice. Situated in the Sociology of Education, and drawing on the social realist concepts of knowledge structures (Bernstein, 2000) and epistemic relations (Maton, 2014), the research maps the <b>topology</b> of <b>engineering</b> problem-solving practice in order to illuminate how novice problem solvers engage in epistemic code shifting in different industrial contexts. The aim in mapping problem-solving practices from an epistemological perspective is to make an empirical contribution to rethinking the theory/practice relationship in multidisciplinary engineering curricula and pedagogy, particularly at the level of technician. A novel and pragmatic problem-solving model - integrated from a range of disciplines - forms the organising framework for a methodologically pluralist case-study approach. The research design draws on a metaphor from the empirical site (modular automation systems) and sees the analysis of twelve matched cases in three categories. Case-study data consist of questionnaire texts, re-enactment interviews, expert verification interviews, and industry literature. The problem-solving model components (problem solver, problem environment, problem structure and problem-solving process) were analysed using, primarily, the Legitimation Code Theory concept of epistemic relations. This is a Cartesian plane-based instrument describing the nature of and relations between a phenomenon (what) and ways of approaching the phenomenon (how). Data analyses are presented as graphical relational maps of different practitioner knowledge practices in different contexts across three problem solving stages: approach, analysis and synthesis. Key findings demonstrate a symbiotic, structuring relationship between the 'what' and the 'how' of the problem in relation to the problem-solving components. Successful problem solving relies on the recognition of these relationships and the realisation of appropriate practice code conventions, as held to be legitimate both epistemologically and contextually. Successful practitioners engage in explicit code-shifting, generally drawing on a priori physics and mathematics-based knowledge, while acquiring a posteriori context-specific logic-based knowledge. High-achieving practitioners across these disciplinary domains demonstrate iterative code-shifting practices and discursive sensitivity. Recommendations for engineering education include the valuing of disciplinary differences and the acknowledgement of contextual complexity. It is suggested that the nature of engineering mathematics as currently taught and the role of mathematical thinking in enabling successful engineering problem-solving practice be investigated...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the <b>topology</b> of <b>engineering</b> systems {{and how that}} topology changes over time. Topology refers to the relative arrangement and connectivity {{of the elements of}} a system. We review network theory relevant to topological evolution and use graph-theoretical methods to analyze real systems, represented as networks. Using existing graph generative models, we develop a profile of canonical graphs and tools to compare a real network to that profile. The developed metrics are used to track topology changes over the history of real networks. This theoretical work is applied to two case studies. The first discusses the US airline industry in terms of routes. We study various airlines and segments of the industry statistically and find commonly occurring patterns. We show that there are topology transitions in the history of airlines in the period 1990 - 2007. Most airline networks have similar topology and historical patterns, with the exception of Southwest Airlines. We show mathematically that Southwest's topology is different. We propose two heuristic growth models, one featuring hub-seeding derived from the underlying patterns of evolution of JetBlue Airways and one featuring local interconnectedness, derived from the patterns of growth of Southwest. The two models match the topologies of these airlines better than canonical models over time. Results suggest that Southwest is becoming more centralized, closer to the hub-spoke topologies of other airlines. Our second case study discusses the growth of language Wikipedia networks, where nodes are articles and hyperlinks are the connections between them. These knowledge networks are subject to different constraints than air transportation systems. The topology of these networks and their growth principles are completely different. Most Wikipedias studied grow by coalescence, with multiple disconnected thematic clusters of pages growing separately and over time, converging to a giant connected component via weak links. These topologies start out as simple trees, and coalesce into sparse hierarchical structures with random interlinking. One striking exception is the history of the Chinese Wikipedia, which grows fully connected from its inception. We discuss these patterns of growth comparatively across Wikipedias, and in general, compared to airline networks. Our work suggests that complex engineering systems are hybrids of pure canonical forms and that they undergo distinct phase transitions during their evolution. We find commonality among systems and uncover important differences by learning from the exceptions. by Gergana Assenova Bounova. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Performance {{and cost}} {{efficiency}} are important demands {{in the design}} of civil structures such as bridges and high-rise buildings. This thesis investigates topology optimization as a tool for achieving these goals during the design process. In order to determine the best structural layout, topology optimization seeks the optimal material distribution in a predefined design domain using numerical optimization. Besides the efficiency and performance of the optimized structure, robustness with respect to uncertain variations in the system is another essential requirement for practical applicability. Variable boundary conditions, uncertain material properties and geometric imperfections are important examples of uncertainties in civil <b>engineering.</b> <b>Topology</b> optimization often leads to structures consisting of slender elements which are particularly sensitive to geometric imperfections. Moreover, imperfections affect the stability of a structure and induce large displacement phenomena such as P-&# 916; effects. The main goal of this thesis is therefore to develop a robust approach to topology optimization which takes into account geometric imperfections. Large displacements effects are incorporated in the optimization by means of a total Lagrangian formulation for geometric nonlinear mechanics. Robust optimization is considered in a probabilistic framework where uncertainties are modeled as random variables characterized by a probability distribution. A weighted sum of the mean and standard deviation of the performance is minimized in the robust optimization problem in order to obtain well-performing structures that are also insensitive to the uncertain variations in the system. During the optimization these stochastic moments of the performance are estimated by means of uncertainty quantification techniques such as Monte Carlo sampling and the stochastic perturbation method. It is shown that the robust designs obtained in this way achieve a good nominal performance and are also much less sensitive to imperfections. status: publishe...|$|R
