5|$|Inverse {{psoriasis}} (also {{known as}} flexural psoriasis) appears as smooth, inflamed patches of skin. The patches frequently affect skin folds, particularly around the genitals (between the thigh and groin), the armpits, {{in the skin}} folds of an overweight abdomen (known as panniculus), between the buttocks in the intergluteal cleft, and under <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> in the inframammary fold. Heat, trauma, and infection are thought {{to play a role}} in the development of this atypical form of psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} an underwire {{can be traced to}} an 1893 patent that {{describes}} a breast supporting device using a rigid plate under <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> for stability. The modern underwire bra was designed in the 1930s, and gained widespread popularity by the 1950s. As of 2005, underwire bras were the largest and fastest growing segment of the bra market. A bra without an underwire is a softcup bra.|$|E

40|$|PRIMARY {{malignant}} disease of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> {{in this country}} accounts for about 20 % of all deaths from {{malignant disease}} in women (Registrar General, 1963). The vast majority of malignant tumours in <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> are primary growths but secondary dzposits may occur. <b>The</b> <b>breast</b> may {{become involved in the}} late stages of a generalised reticulosis. Trevithick (1903) described a case of reticulosis in a 13 year old girl who had deposits in both breasts. Haram (1937), Anderson and Roberts (1954), Sandison (1959), Stringer (1959) and other authors have described cases with deposits of reticulosarcoma, lymphosarcoma and lymphatic and monocytic leukaemia in <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> tissue. <b>The</b> <b>breast</b> may also be involved by metastases from a primary lesion in <b>the</b> opposite <b>breast.</b> Kilgore (1932), Leo (1930) and Geschickter (1945) found that about 7. 5 % of women with cancer of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> developed a cancer in <b>the</b> opposite <b>breast.</b> In these cases the growth in <b>the</b> second <b>breast</b> may have been either a new primary growth or a metastatic deposit from <b>the</b> other <b>breast.</b> True secondary deposits in <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> from malignant disease elsewhere ar...|$|R

5|$|Underwire bras, {{like other}} constrictive garments, may {{contribute}} to clogged milk ducts in lactating women. Fluctuating breast size during pregnancy poses another problem. Because underwire bras are rigid, they do not easily accommodate changes in breast size, and an ill-fitting bra that does not support <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> correctly can cause discomfort and pain. For several days after a mastectomy, or {{as long as the}} breast is tender, a woman is advised not to use an underwire bra.|$|E
5|$|Nestlings have dark grey {{or brown}} down, cream to grey bills, cream gapes and orange throats. The plumage of {{juvenile}} birds {{in their first}} moult resembles that of the adult female, but the head and upperparts are streaked and slightly darker. Soon after fledging, juveniles moult into their first immature plumage, and more closely resemble the adult female. <b>The</b> <b>breasts</b> of male birds may have some orange feathers. Birds in their second year moult into a second immature phase, some males of which may resemble adult males, while others retain a more immature brown plumage. Determining the age and sex of birds in brown plumage can be very difficult. Information on exact timing of moulting is lacking, but the replacement of primary feathers takes place over the summer months between December and February.|$|E
5|$|There are {{references}} to bikinis in ancient literature as well. Ovid, the writer ranked alongside Virgil and Horace {{as one of}} the three canonical poets of Latin literature, suggests the breastband or long strip of cloth wrapped around <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> and tucked in the ends, {{is a good place to}} hide love-letters. Martial, a Latin poet from Hispania who published between AD 86 and 103, satirized a female athlete he named Philaenis, who played ball in a bikini-like garb quite bluntly, making her drink, gorge and vomit in abundance and hinting at her lesbianism. In an epigram on Chione, Martial strangely mentions a sex worker who went to the bathhouse in a bikini, while it was more natural to go unclothed. Reportedly Theodora, the 6th century empress of the Byzantine Empire wore a bikini when she appeared as an actress before she captured the heart of emperor Justinian I.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBreast pain affects up to 70 % of {{the female}} population. It is {{believed}} that stretching of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> tissue causes discomfort and that by placing <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> into a position in which the tissue is neither in compression or tension (termed neutral position) will eliminate <b>breast</b> pain. <b>The</b> {{purpose of the study}} was to find a simple method that could be used to determine the location of the neutral position. One participant with a breast size of 34 C performed three activities. <b>The</b> <b>breast</b> and torso movement were tracked using four retroreflective markers. The results suggest that the counter-movement jump was the most appropriate method as it forced <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> to oscillate from tension in the upper-side of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> to tension in the under-side of <b>the</b> <b>breast.</b> <b>The</b> neutral position was found to be - 129 ± 6 mm below the suprasternal notch, which was located 14 mm above the resting height of <b>the</b> <b>breast.</b> It was concluded that the first role of a bra is to lift <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> above <b>the</b> static position to cause more symmetrical oscillations about the neutral position...|$|R

25|$|At menopause, breast atrophy occurs. <b>The</b> <b>breasts</b> can {{decrease}} in size when {{the levels of}} circulating estrogen decline.

25|$|A belt {{could also}} be {{fastened}} over a simple tunic-like garment or undergarment, just below <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> or over <b>the</b> <b>breasts.</b> When the apodesmos was worn under <b>the</b> <b>breasts,</b> it accentuated them. Another word for a breast-band or belt was strophion (Gr: στρόφιον). A further term was kestós (Gr: κεστός, Latin: cestus), used specifically for Aphrodite's charmed girdle in the Iliad, whose power was to make every woman who wore it irresistible to men. In view of its association with the love goddess, this type of garment probably had an erotic connotation because of its effect to accentuate the breast.|$|E

25|$|Anaesthestic {{preparation}} — To limit bleeding {{during the}} liposuction, the proper degree of vasoconstriction of <b>the</b> <b>breast's</b> circulatory system is established with an anaesthetic solution (lidocaine + epinephrine in saline solution) that is infiltrated {{to the deep}} and the superficial plains of each breast.

25|$|During pregnancy, <b>the</b> <b>breasts</b> become {{enlarged}} and denser (firmer) {{because of}} the prolactin-caused organ hypertrophy.

40|$|Our aim was {{to assess}} the {{feasibility}} and accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> with SonoVue microbubbles for pre-operative size measurement of invasive breast carcinomas. Seven patients diagnosed with nine invasive breast carcinomas prospectively underwent gray-scale ultrasound and CEUS of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> according to a standardized protocol. CEUS of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> was performed by a Philips iU 22 scanner equipped with a 4 – 8 [*]MHz linear array transducer. We used a single dose of 2. 4 [*]ml SonoVue as contrast agent. Breast lesion morphology was scored according to the sonographic BI-RADS lexicon criteria and classified accordingly. The greatest tumor dimensions on gray-scale ultrasound and CEUS of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> were finally compared with the greatest histopathologic tumor sizes. Gray-scale ultrasound underestimated the histopathologic tumor size in 6 / 9 cases (67 %), whereas CEUS of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> underestimated tumor size in only 3 / 9 (33 %) cases. CEUS of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> was significantly more accurate for tumor size assessment.

50|$|Plastic {{surgeons}} categorize ptosis by {{evaluating the}} position of the nipple relative to the inframammary crease (where the underside of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> meets <b>the</b> chest wall). This is determined by measuring {{from the center of the}} nipple to the sternal notch (at the top of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> bone) to gauge how far the nipple has fallen. The standard anthropometric measurement for young women is 21 cm. This measurement is used to assess both breast ptosis and <b>breast</b> symmetry. <b>The</b> surgeon will assess <b>the</b> <b>breast's</b> angle of projection. The apex of <b>the</b> <b>breast,</b> which includes <b>the</b> nipple, can have a flat angle of projection (180 degrees) or acute angle of projection (greater than 180 degrees). The apex rarely has an angle greater than 60 degrees. The angle of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> apex is partly determined by the tautness of the suspensory Cooper's ligaments. For example, when a woman lies on her back, the angle of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> apex becomes a flat, obtuse angle (less than 180 degrees) while the base-to-length ratio of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> ranges from 0.5 to 1.0.|$|R
