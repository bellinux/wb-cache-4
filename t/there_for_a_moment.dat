Sometimes they remark, [...] "What did you say? I got absentminded <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and wasn't paying attention to anything." [...] This is slightly distressing to the subjects and indicative of the fact that their attention was so focused and fixated on the peculiar hand stimuli that they were momentarily entranced so they did not hear what was said.|$|E
60|$|He {{sprang to}} his feet and stood <b>there,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> unsteadily.|$|E
60|$|Quest, however, {{who heard}} the {{footsteps}} of the others behind him, loitered <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
60|$|The two Germans {{regarded}} {{him as he}} crouched <b>there.</b> Death <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> seemed near.|$|R
60|$|Maraton's {{face was}} inscrutable but <b>there</b> was, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>a</b> {{dangerous}} flash in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Dale stood <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> blank <b>moment,</b> and then, {{taking up}} his rifle, he strode away.|$|R
60|$|She {{crossed the}} room towards the {{hearthrug}} and stood <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> leaning against the mantelpiece.|$|E
60|$|Again she put {{a gentle}} hand on his sleeve and left it <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> The touch thrilled all through Kurt.|$|E
60|$|He fitted the {{combination}} and swung open the door. He stood <b>there,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> speechless. Something in his attitude attracted the Inspector's attention.|$|E
60|$|I fancied that in Louis' {{green eyes}} <b>there</b> shot <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>a</b> gleam of {{something}} like admiration.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> came <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> no answer. The girl's cry was stifled, {{as though}} by a rough hand.|$|R
60|$|The old man laid {{a kindly}} {{hand on his}} {{shoulder}} and kept it <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments.</b>|$|R
60|$|The lad {{was evidently}} unwilling {{to be left}} <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> alone, and he walked back with Guy to the {{buttress}} where the archer was standing.|$|E
60|$|The old man {{lifted the}} candle with shaking fingers. Then it dropped {{with a crash}} to the ground, and lay <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> spluttering. He shrank back.|$|E
6000|$|He {{placed his}} fingers upon my wrist; and holding them <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> sprang to his feet, and, with much enthusiasm, {{pronounced}} me a Yankee, every beat of my pulse! ...|$|E
60|$|Tomlinson {{started a}} little, and <b>there</b> was <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>a</b> curious {{look in his}} face, which did not escape the corporal's attention.|$|R
60|$|She took {{both his}} hands and held them <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Then {{she walked to the}} door, made sure that it was {{securely}} fastened, and stood <b>there</b> listening <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|R
60|$|He glanced rapidly {{down his}} beard, {{and when he}} looked up again <b>there</b> was <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>an</b> {{interested}} expression in his misty gaze. Razumov discouraged it with a cold, repellent smile.|$|R
60|$|As {{we stood}} <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> spellbound {{by the sight}} of those fearsome creatures occupying the very thrones of the sovereigns of England, the low growl was repeated, and a great male rose slowly to his feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite certain. He {{suddenly}} appeared {{by the side}} of that gray bowlder, stood <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and sunk down again. I expect he must have got a view of one of the men somewhere along the top." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's only {{crossing}} the bar, sir, {{and up the}} stairs, if you wouldn't mind, and waiting <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> till I get a candle. If you should hear a dog, sir, it's only Merrylegs, and he only barks.' ...|$|E
60|$|Crusoe {{turned and}} quietly dropped the dog into the lake. Having {{regarded}} his struggles <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> with grave severity of countenance, he walked slowly back {{and sat down}} beside his master.|$|R
60|$|She said 'Good evening,' too, {{tying the}} score. And <b>there</b> was silence <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|R
6000|$|It {{was very}} dark in <b>there,</b> and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{he could see}} nothing, could hear nothing. Then a faint whisper made itself {{distinctly}} audible just above his head. [...] "Victor, my boy," [...] it said.|$|R
6000|$|Carryl came up {{with the}} lady on his arm; and as he stood <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> in the coolest, most {{indifferent}} tone in the world, said, [...] "Oh! by the by, Miss Ellis, let me present my friend Mr. Seymour." ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{hand was}} lying on the seat. He covered it with his own so quickly that she left it <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> as though paralyzed, while she listened to the first serious words he had ever {{addressed}} to her.|$|E
6000|$|COUNT. A noble saying--and {{acted on}} would yield A nobler breed {{of men and}} women. Lady, I find you a shrewd bargainer. The wreath That once you wore outvalues twentyfold The {{diamonds}} that you never deign'd to wear. But lay them <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment!</b> ...|$|E
60|$|Each of them promised five hundred, {{and then}} looked at Clavering, who had not spoken. One of them also fancied that <b>there</b> was <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>a</b> trace of embarrassment in his face; but he smiled carelessly.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> {{was silence}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Sir Lucius would not disturb it, and Mrs. Dallington again spoke.|$|R
60|$|Static. A rushing sound, {{like the}} wind. They gazed at each other. <b>There</b> was silence <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|R
60|$|Crouching <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> longer, a man {{bereft of}} {{movement}} and of reason, stood O'Moy, conscious only of pain, in an agony of mind and heart that at {{one and the same}} time froze his blood and drew the sweat from his brow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hullo!" [...] said Mr. Scogan, {{catching}} {{him by the}} arm; {{dazed and}} hardly conscious {{of what he was}} doing or where he was, Denis stood <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> like a somnambulist. [...] "What's the matter?" [...] Mr. Scogan went on. [...] "you look disturbed, distressed, depressed." ...|$|E
60|$|Juanna saw also, and {{springing}} {{forward on}} to a rock, stood <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{in the full}} glare of the sun. Instantly a murmur went up from the host; a great voice called a command; the barbs of steel flickered like innumerable stars, and sank downwards.|$|E
60|$|<b>There</b> {{was silence}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Cecily {{did not know}} what to say. Suddenly Lucy Ellen burst out bitterly.|$|R
60|$|He {{felt her}} grow tense in her clasp upon his arm, and hold <b>there</b> rigidly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> while the swift {{thoughts}} whirled through her mind. Then, {{as if the}} struggle had ended, she silently relaxed, and leaned more heavily against him.|$|R
6000|$|<b>There</b> was <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>a</b> great {{swelling}} of something in our hero's breast; then a sudden thought occurred, [...] "Never venture never--;" [...] next instant he seized Flora's hand. [...] "Oh, Miss West--Flora, dearest Flora--forgive--nay, do not turn away, I entreat, I beseech--" ...|$|R
