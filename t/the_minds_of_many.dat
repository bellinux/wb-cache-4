5|$|As {{a result}} of this {{disaster}} King Rama I predicted that the Chakri dynasty would last only 150 years from its foundation. This prophecy was recorded in a diary of a princess of the first reign, after reading it many years later, King Rama V remarked that 150 years was too short and that the princess must have inadvertently dropped a nought. This prophecy was again present in <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> people, when only three months after the dynasty's 150th anniversary celebrations the Siamese revolution of 1932 was carried out. The revolution replaced the absolute monarchy of the Chakri monarchs with a constitutional monarchy with Siam's first constitution.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{suffered}} a sudden apoplectic {{fit on the}} morning of 2 February 1685, and died aged 54 at 11:45am four days later at Whitehall Palace. The suddenness of his illness and death led to suspicion of poison in <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many,</b> including one of the royal doctors; however, a more modern medical analysis has held that the symptoms of his final illness {{are similar to those of}} uraemia (a clinical syndrome due to kidney dysfunction). In the days between his collapse and his death, Charles endured a variety of torturous treatments including bloodletting, purging and cupping in hopes of effecting a recovery.|$|E
5|$|A final {{reason for}} the Second Settlement was to give the Principate {{constitutional}} stability and staying power in case something happened to Princeps Augustus. His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin thread {{of the life of}} one man, Augustus himself, who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life. If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid in <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> citizens. Proconsular imperium was conferred upon Agrippa for five years, similar to Augustus' power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus' imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas.|$|E

5|$|Calling a {{constitutional}} convention required {{the approval of}} a majority of voters in two successive elections or a two-thirds majority of both houses of the General Assembly. In February 1797, the General Assembly voted to put the question before the electorate in the upcoming May elections. Of the 9,814 votes cast, 5,446 favored the call and 440 opposed it, but 3,928 had not voted at all, and several counties recorded no votes on the issue either way. This cast doubt in <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> legislators regarding the true will of the people. Opponents of the convention claimed that the abstentions should be counted as votes against the call; this position had some merit, as it was well known that many Fayette County voters had abstained as a protest against the convention. When all of the irregularities were accounted for, the General Assembly determined that the vote had fallen short of the required majority.|$|E
5|$|Several {{theoretical}} {{objections to}} the claims of Fermi's paper were quickly raised; in particular, the exact process that took place when an atom captured a neutron was not well understood at the time. This and Fermi's accidental discovery three months later that nuclear reactions could be induced by slow neutrons cast further doubt in <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> scientists, notably Aristid von Grosse and Ida Noddack, that the experiment was creating element 93. While von Grosse's claim that Fermi was actually producing protactinium (element 91) was quickly tested and disproved, Noddack's proposal that the uranium had been shattered into two or more much smaller fragments was simply ignored by most because existing nuclear theory {{did not include a}} way for this to be possible. Fermi and his team maintained that they were in fact synthesizing a new element, but the issue remained unresolved for several years.|$|E

In the midst of these trying times, it was the betrayal of William Pitt and Edmund Burke that most angered Priestley and his friends; they had expected the two men's support and instead both argued vociferously against the repeal. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but to no avail. These publications unfortunately also inflamed the populace against him.|$|E
25|$|The {{industrial}} use of mechanical meat shredding was the technical advance that helped popularize the Hamburg steak. The first meat grinder {{was invented in}} the early 19th century by the German engineer Karl Drais. The machine {{made it possible for}} minced meat to be sold at market in large quantities at reasonable prices. By 1845, numerous patents existed for improved meat grinders in the United States. These machines could all shred meat to sizes before unimaginable. Before this, minced meat was prepared by hand at home using specialized chisels, intensive manual labor that severely limited the amount that could be produced. It is very likely that the invention of the meat grinder contributed directly to the popularization of Hamburg steak, while the steak gradually became distant from its German roots in <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> Americans. Minced meat also came to be used in other popular American foods, including hot dogs and meatloaf.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Fiesta Bowl, {{unhindered}} by conference tie-ins {{and played}} in generally warm weather, propelled itself to major-bowl status by attracting national championship contenders, most notably with its January 1987 matchup between two independent teams Penn State and Miami.

Despite this, the Cotton Bowl Classic still retained enough prestige that it was included {{as one of the}} top bowls in the Bowl Coalition when it was formed in 1992. However, in 1995, the new Bowl Alliance (the predecessor of the BCS) chose to include the Fiesta over the Cotton in its rotation. While it was still a major bowl capable of landing Top 10 teams, it was no longer in a position to host a National Championship contestant. In 18 of the 21 seasons since 1995, the Cotton Bowl has featured two ranked opponents. In the other three seasons, one of the teams was ranked (2002, 2003, and 2010).|$|E
25|$|It is the {{reasoned}} {{conclusion of}} this study... that the sense of guilt created by the Vietnam war in <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> Americans is not warranted and that the charges of officially, condoned illegal and grossly immoral conduct are without substance. Indeed, detailed examination of battlefield practices reveals that the loss civilian life in Vietnam was less great than in World War II and Korea and that concern with minimizing the ravages {{of the war was}} strong. To measure and compare the devastation and loss of human life caused by different war will be objectionable to those who repudiate all resort to military force as an instrument of foreign policy and may be construed as callousness. Yet as long as wars do take place at all it remains a moral duty to seek to reduce the agony caused by war, and the fulfillment of this obligation should not be disdained. I hope that this book may help demonstrate that moral convictions are not the exclusive possession of persons in conscience opposed to war, and that those who in certain circumstances accept the necessity and ethical justification of armed conflict also do care about human suffering.|$|E
