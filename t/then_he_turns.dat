5|$|At the old lady's house, Gary {{has been}} fed a lot. The old lady puts out fresh sheets of flyers {{given to her}} by Patrick. Upon reading them, Gary realizes that SpongeBob truly loves him and wants him back. He tries to leave, but instead of doing that, he ends up going to the closet, filled with empty snail shells. When the old lady tries to feed him again, Gary finds that the old lady most likely has {{sinister}} motives—she is possibly trying to fatten and then eat him. He makes his escape, but the old lady chases him out onto the streets. Gary quickly finds one of the gangster snails he saw before, which the old lady now mistakes for Miss Tuftsy, and takes him home instead. Back home, SpongeBob gives up on his search for Gary, and tries to forget about him by taking a walk, but his memories keep coming to mind and upsetting him. He is constantly reminded as the streets are filled with posters and signs for Gary. SpongeBob then hears a meow. At first he thinks he is imagining Gary is there, but <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> around to find Gary is actually at his side, and he is overjoyed to see his beloved pet again.|$|E
25|$|Alalia and Fratt, {{with the}} {{guidance}} of Ayn, finally reach their destination and prepare for the live broadcast. They contact Pjölk, who happily commands them to begin the transmission, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> off his tele-o-visor and sits {{down in front of}} his typewriter to create the headline article for tomorrow's issue of his tabloid. He fabricates an entire story based on how he is distressed for being responsible for killing the nerd viewers, and where he makes a statement saying {{that there should be a}} law banning tele-o-vision forever. Not yet aware of the danger they are putting themselves in, Alalia and Fratt start broadcasting and begin their quest through the lair, following Ayn of Raiká.|$|E
500|$|She {{continues}} {{walking down}} the street, where she smashes the camera of a paparazzi photographer who takes pictures of her. More paparazzi appear as she runs away and jumps {{on top of a}} taxi. Spears then stands atop of it, wielding the microphone as a weapon against the paparazzi who are hassling her. Across the street, a marquee of the cinema besides her reads , referencing her film debut Crossroads. After all the paparazzi, revealed to be cyborgs, have been knocked to the floor, they start crawling back with their eyes glowing red and their faces bursting with wires, reminiscent to a scene in [...] (1991). A car suddenly pulls up near to Spears, and the driver Guillermo Díaz tells her to get inside. In the next scene, Spears dances in the passenger seat in a pink bikini top, as Guillermo drives. He attempts to drink some milk while driving but pours the carton of milk over his face. His chest starts to spark, and Spears pulls open his jacket to reveal that he too is a cyborg. The video then cuts back to the press conference, indicating that Spears was daydreaming, due to being asked monotonous and inappropriate questions. Guillermo steps in and leads Spears out of the room. <b>Then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> to the camera with his eyes glowing red, and his laugh is heard, referencing Michael Jackson's Thriller (1983).|$|E

2500|$|Settle gives Theobald full {{knowledge}} of Dulness. [...] This is his baptism: {{the time when}} he can claim his divine role and begin his mission (in a parody of Jesus being blessed by the Holy Spirit). Settle shows Theobald the past triumphs of Dulness in its battles with reason and science. He surveys the translatio stultitia: [...] the Great Wall of China and the emperor burning all learned books, Egypt and Omar I burning the books in the Ptolemean library. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> to follow the light of the sun/learning to Europe and says, ...|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{believed}} [...] "each {{generation has}} its own task and need not trouble itself unduly by being everything to previous and succeeding generations". In an earlier book he had said, [...] "to a certain degree every generation and every individual begins his life from the beginning", and in another, [...] "no generation has learned to love from another, no generation is able to begin at any other point than the beginning", [...] "no generation learns the essentially human from a previous one." [...] He was against the Hegelian idea of mediation because it introduces a [...] "third term" [...] that comes between the single individual and the object of desire. Kierkegaard asked if logic ends in actuality, can a person logically prove God's existence? Logic says no. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> from logic to ethics and finds that Hegelian philosophy is negative rather than positive. This [...] "third term" [...] isn't mediation, it's the choice to love or not, to hope or not. It's the choice between {{the possibility of the}} [...] "temporal and the eternal", [...] "mistrust and belief, and deception and truth", [...] "subjective and objective". These are the [...] "magnitudes" [...] of choice. He always stressed deliberation and choice in his writings and wrote against comparison. This is how Kant put it in 1786 and Kierkegaard put it in 1847: ...|$|E

60|$|Presently she {{saw some}} one walking over {{the open space}} towards the cabin, {{and she could not}} fail to {{recognize}} the figure with the long stride, the folded arms, and the bowed head.

60|$|Now and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> to the camp-bed, and wetting his towel in the basin, presses {{it against}} his brow. Now he {{leans back in his}} chair, as if to give up; but again bends over and plods.|$|E

60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> around, blubbering, {{and makes}} a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn't drop a carpet-bag and bust out a-crying. If they warn't the beatenest lot, them two frauds, that ever I struck.|$|E
6000|$|ERNEST (foolishly in the circumstances). A strong man. You mean a stout man. You {{are one of}} mind to two of matter. (He looks {{round in}} the old way for approval. No one has smiled, and to his consternation he sees that CRICHTON is quietly turning up his sleeves. ERNEST makes an {{appealing}} gesture to his uncle; <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> defiantly to CRICHTON.) ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{not until}} they are gone, that Mr. Jasper moves. But <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> to Durdles, and bursts into a fit of laughter. Durdles, who still has that {{suspended}} something in his cheek, and who sees nothing to laugh at, stares at him until Mr. Jasper lays his face down on his arms to have his laugh out. Then Durdles bolts the something, as if desperately resigning himself to indigestion.|$|E

6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> to the Veneto, and {{describes}} {{to him the}} English manner of living. [...] "Wonderfully well they eat--the English. Four times a day. With rosbif at the dinner. Always, always, always! And tea in the evening, with rosbif cold. Mangiano sempre. Ma bene, dico." [...] After a pause, [...] "Sì!" [...] "And the Venetians, they eat well, too. Whence the proverb: 'Sulla Riva degli Schiavoni, si mangiano bei bocconi.' ('On the Riva degli Schiavoni, you eat fine mouthfuls.') Signori, I am going to Venice," [...] concludes the cameriere.|$|E
60|$|Ten minutes pass by in intense silence. Down on the shore, {{fifty yards}} below, a slight swaying of the {{bilberry}} bushes catches your eye. That surely {{is not the}} bear! There {{has not been a}} sound since he disappeared. A squirrel could hardly creep through that underbrush without noise enough to tell where he was. But the bushes sway again, and Mooween reappears suddenly for another long look at the suspicious object. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> and plods his way along shore, rolling his {{head from side to side}} as if completely mystified.|$|E
6000|$|BENNET. I am old-fashioned {{enough to}} think also of my duty to those I serve. If his lordship has done me the honour to marry my niece, the least I can is {{to see to it}} that she brings no {{discredit}} to his name. [Mrs. Bennet, followed by Jane Bennet, a severe-looking woman of middle age, has entered upon the words [...] "the least I can do." [...] Bennet stays them a moment with his hand while he finishes. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> to his wife.] You will be interested to find, Susannah, that the new Lady Bantock is not a stranger.|$|E
