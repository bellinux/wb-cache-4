5|$|Heyer {{frequently}} {{highlights the}} heroine's many masculine qualities, {{which include a}} fierce independence and a disregard for social mores. Modern literary critics have noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the protagonists is modelled on those of the latter 20th century, offering companionship and allowing both parties to retain a level of independence. The heroine's unwillingness to conform attracts the hero, rather than repels him.|$|E
5|$|In {{a country}} in which few women may take out loans from large {{commercial}} banks, Grameen has focused on women borrowers; 97% of its members are women. While a World Bank study has concluded that women's access to microcredit empowers them through greater access to resources and control over decision making, some other economists argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> microcredit and women-empowerment is less straightforward.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Brad Follmer {{was created in}} season nine to provide a love interest for Reyes, as the writers believed the audience needed {{to know more about}} her. However, Follmer's unresolved relationship with Reyes also served to heighten the conflict between Doggett and Follmer, as both men had feelings for her. Portraying actress Annabeth Gish was pleased <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> her character and Scully was similar to that of two sisters, rather than Reyes serving as an antagonist to Scully.|$|E

5|$|After Leafs General Manager Pat Quinn {{was unwilling}} to give Joseph a {{four-year}} contract (he offered three years), he left after the 2001–02 season to sign with the Detroit Red Wings. Some also speculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> Quinn and Joseph was frosty because Quinn had benched Joseph in the Salt Lake City Olympics after the first game, although Joseph himself denied the rumours, saying that he played a bad first game against Sweden (losing 5–2) and that Martin Brodeur played very well {{for the rest of}} the tournament, earning his spot as the starter. Joseph had also hinted at wanting to play for a team that could win it all, implying the Leafs were not such a team. Joseph's move to Detroit was highly publicized and unpopular in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Complicating {{factors include}} claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{relationship}}</b> <b>between</b> eukaryotes and the archaeal phylum Crenarchaeota is closer than {{the relationship between}} the Euryarchaeota and the phylum Crenarchaeota and the presence of archaea-like genes in certain bacteria, such as Thermotoga maritima, from horizontal gene transfer. The standard hypothesis states that the ancestor of the eukaryotes diverged early from the Archaea, and that eukaryotes arose through fusion of an archaean and eubacterium, which became the nucleus and cytoplasm; this explains various genetic similarities but runs into difficulties explaining cell structure. An alternative hypothesis, the eocyte hypothesis, posits that Eukaryota emerged relatively late from the Archaea.|$|E
5|$|Frederick Barbarossa, who {{had been}} crowned Holy Roman Emperor, {{received}} the envoys of Manuel I in Nuremberg in July 1156. The Byzantine envoys proposed a joint invasion of Hungary, but Barbarossa refused their offer. On 16 September, Barbarossa stipulated that the dukes of Austria were to support the Holy Roman emperors during a war against Hungary in his charter by which he elevated Austria to a duchy, showing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire was still tense. Barbarossa's close advisor, Daniel, Bishop of Prague, visited Hungary {{in the summer of}} 1157. On this occasion, Géza promised that he would support Barbarossa with auxiliary troops if the emperor invaded Italy.|$|E

5|$|Historians have {{generally}} accepted Bede's report of Coenred's and Offa's abdications, but Barbara Yorke {{has suggested that}} they may not have relinquished their thrones voluntarily. There are instances of kings being forcibly removed and placed in holy orders to make them ineligible for kingship; one such was King Osred II of Northumbria, who was forced into a monastery. On the other hand, if Coenred went willingly, as Bede relates, then the apparently friendly relationship between Offa and Coenred, his overlord, makes it clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> an overlord and his underking was not hostile in every case.|$|E
5|$|On the DVD Commentary, series creator Rob Thomas opined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> Veronica and Keith was {{the core}} of the series and listed the scene in which Keith stays up all night before scaring Veronica in the morning as one of his {{favorite}} examples of their chemistry in the season. Thomas highlighted the scene in which a girl shows Veronica around the sorority as indicative of Hansen's comedic talents; in addition, it marked the first appearance of David Tom in the season, a guest star in season two who was brought back for a recurring role in this season. The actress who played the girl showing Veronica around, Keri Lynn Pratt, previously appeared in the film Drive Me Crazy, which Thomas co-wrote.|$|E
5|$|Sunset Overdrive {{was among}} {{one of the}} first Xbox One exclusives {{revealed}} at Microsoft's press conference at E3 2013. The first gameplay details were revealed by gaming magazine Edge in May 2014. A gameplay demo and a release date announcement happened at E3 2014. Insomniac had worked solely for the PlayStation family for about twenty years, and the announcement of Sunset Overdrive being an Xbox exclusive led to speculation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> Sony and Insomniac had ended. Insomniac denied such rumors, saying the company would still be working with other publishers to produce titles and that petitions would not change Sunset Overdrives status as an Xbox exclusive.

5|$|At the {{invitation}} of {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr, Bohr visited the Manhattan Project sites in November 1943. Groves offered Bohr substantial pay, but Bohr initially refused the offer because {{he wanted to make sure}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the United States and Great Britain remained a real cooperative partnership. In December 1943, after a meeting with Albert Einstein, Bohr and his son Aage committed to working on the Manhattan Project. Bohr made a substantial contribution to the atomic bomb development effort. He also attempted to prevent an atomic arms race with the Soviet Union after the war, which he believed to be a serious threat. In 1944, Bohr made several key points he believed to be essential towards international nuclear weapon control. He urged that Britain and the United States should inform the Soviet Union about the Manhattan Project in order to decrease the likelihood of it feeling threatened on the premise that the other nations were building a bomb behind their back. His beliefs stemmed from the fact that he was convinced the Russians already knew about the Manhattan Project, which therefore led him to believe that there was no point in hiding it from them.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the international organization, the Temple sponsors initiatory Orders and Elements and local groups called Pylons. Pylons are intended to facilitate the initiatory work of the Temple's members by conducting meetings where discussions and magical works take place. The purpose of a pylon {{is to provide a}} space in which the Setian can focus on their religion, aided by like-minded individuals. Pylons typically meet in a member's home. Members usually join the Pylon located geographically closest to them. Correspondence- or Internet-based Pylons also exist, with Harvey noting that this online networking is more common than in-person interaction. A Pylon is led a by a second-degree (or higher) member who is called a Sentinel. The term pylon derives from the architectural features which served as fortified gateways to ancient Egyptian temples. One Finnish Setian informed Granholm <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the orders and the temple was like that of different departments in a university.|$|E
5|$|It {{was once}} {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the obligate and regular ant-followers {{and the army}} ants, particularly Eciton burchellii, was mutualistic, with the ants benefiting by having the birds chase prey back down towards them. However, experiments where ant followers were excluded {{have shown that the}} foraging success of the army ants was 30% lower when the birds were present, suggesting that the birds' relationship was in fact parasitic. This has resulted in a number of behaviours by the ants in order to reduce kleptoparasitism, including hiding of secured prey in the leaf litter and caching of food on trails. It has been suggested that the depressive effect of this parasitism slows the development of E. burchellii swarms and in turn benefits other ant species which are preyed upon by army ants. The ant-following antbirds are themselves followed by three species of butterfly in the family Ithomiinae which feed on their droppings. Bird droppings are usually an unpredictable resource in a rainforest, but the regular behaviour of ant followers makes the exploitation of this resource possible.|$|E

5|$|K. V. Vijayendra Prasad was {{watching}} a Marathi film where two warriors Sivaji and Tanaji are attacked by Mughal Army. Once the duo can reach Sinhagad fort, they can kill the army together effectively. While Sivaji escapes to the fort for support, Tanaji fights with the army and dies in the process leaving Sivaji in grief. Prasad took this as an inspiration and wrote {{a story on the}} theme of reincarnation of a bodyguard who serves a queen. He fights 100 warriors and dies in his attempt to re-enthrone his queen after she is overthrown by her conspirators. He is reborn after 400 years and fulfils his ambition of placing her on the throne by making her a Chief Minister or a popular social worker like Medha Patkar. It was subsequently rejected and after fifteen years, his son director S. S. Rajamouli selected this script, but made several changes to it. Rajamouli re-characterised the queen as a princess to create a vital love story for the film, as he felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> a queen and a bodyguard would be only about loyalty and honesty.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{made several}} changes from Gerolmo's {{original}} draft. He omitted the Mafia hitman {{and created the}} character Agent Monk, a black FBI specialist who kidnaps Tilman. The scene in which Frank Bailey brutally beats a news cameraman {{was based on an}} actual event; Parker and Colesberry were inspired by a news outtake found during their research, in which a CBS News cameraman was assaulted by a suspect in the 1964 murder case. Parker also wrote a sex scene involving Rupert Anderson and Mrs. Pell. The scene was omitted during filming after Gene Hackman, who portrays Anderson, suggested to Parker <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the two characters be more discreet. By January 4, 1988, Parker had written a complete shooting script, which he submitted to Orion executives. Gerolmo did not visit the production during principal photography, due to the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike.|$|E
5|$|While {{married to}} Sarah Tekarihogen, Jones {{maintained}} {{a relationship with}} Tuhbenahneequay (Sarah Henry), the daughter of Mississauga chief Wahbanosay. Jones had previously hired Wahbanosay as a guide during some of his surveying expeditions in the area, including the surveying of Yonge Street. Their relationship had begun in the mid-1790s, and Jones had previously married Tuhbenahneequay in a Mississauga ceremony. Their first son, John (anglicised as Theyandanegea, written in Ojibwa as Tyenteneged, after Joseph Brant) was born in 1798. Their second son, Peter Jones (Kahkewaquonaby) was born January 1, 1802 to Tuhbenahneequay {{in the area of}} Burlington Heights. Due to Jones' marriage to Sarah Tekarihogen, the task of raising Peter and John was left to Tuhbenahneequay. It was soon after their second son's birth <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> Jones and Tuhbenahneequay ended. Jones wanted the respect of his Christian neighbours, who disapproved of polygamy, and so Jones settled permanently with Sarah Tekarihogen, who had converted to Christianity.|$|E

5|$|Between 1938 and 1940, {{following}} German–Italian mediation in the First and Second Vienna Awards, and the Hungarian {{invasion of}} Carpatho-Ukraine, Hungary enlarged its territory. It absorbed parts of southern Czechoslovakia, Carpathian Ruthenia {{and the northern}} part of Transylvania, which the Kingdom of Romania ceded. One of the ethno-cultural areas that changed hands between Romania and Hungary at this time was the Székely Land. The support that Hungary received from Germany for these border revisions meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the two countries became even closer. On 20 November 1940, Hungary formally joined the Axis Tripartite Pact. On 12 December 1940, at the initiative of the Prime Minister, Count Pál Teleki, Hungary concluded a friendship and non-aggression treaty with Yugoslavia. Although the concept had received support from both Germany and Italy, the actual signing of the treaty did not, as Germany's planned invasion of Greece would be simplified if Yugoslavia could be neutralised. After the Yugoslav military coup of 27 March 1941, when the Germans asked the Hungarian Regent, Miklós Horthy, for clearance to launch one of their armoured thrusts using Hungarian territory, Teleki was unable to dissuade the Regent. Concluding that Hungary had disgraced itself irrevocably by siding with the Germans against the Yugoslavs, Teleki shot himself. Horthy informed Hitler that evening that Hungary would abide by the friendship treaty with Yugoslavia, though it would likely cease to apply should Croatia secede and Yugoslavia cease to exist.|$|E
