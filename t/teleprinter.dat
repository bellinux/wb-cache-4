5|$|Early {{means of}} {{communicating}} over a distance included visual signals, such as beacons, smoke signals, semaphore telegraphs, signal flags, and optical heliographs. Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats, lung-blown horns, and loud whistles. 20th and 21st century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies, such as telegraph, telephone, and <b>teleprinter,</b> networks, radio, microwave transmission, fiber optics, and communications satellites.|$|E

50|$|Computers used <b>tele{{printers}}</b> {{for input}} and output {{from the early days}} of computing. Punched card readers and fast printers replaced <b>teleprinters</b> for most purposes, but <b>teleprinters</b> continued to be used as interactive time-sharing terminals until video displays became widely available in the late 1970s.|$|R
2500|$|The term {{radioteletype}} is used {{to describe}} both the original radioteletype system, sometimes described as [...] "Baudot", {{as well as the}} entire family of systems connecting two or more <b>teleprinters</b> or PCs using software to emulate <b>teleprinters,</b> over radio, regardless of alphabet, link system or modulation.|$|R
5|$|In November 1932, it was {{reported}} that new radio equipment was to be installed at Lympne and St Inglevert operating on the 15 centimetre waveband at 2,000MHz, which would be used for the announcement of departures of non-radio aircraft across the Channel. Messages sent by radio were also printed out by a <b>teleprinter,</b> providing a record of the communication. The British Air Ministry and the French Ministère de l'Air co-operated in the arrangements for setting up the system, which was scheduled to come into operation in Spring 1933. It proved its effectiveness on 7 March 1933, when a non-radio de Havilland DH.60 Moth of British Air Transport failed to arrive at Lympne. The aircraft had ditched in the Channel and both occupants were rescued by a steamship bound for Amsterdam, the Netherlands. A new short-wave radio system came into operation on 16 January 1934, using equipment manufactured by Le Matériel Téléphonique, Paris.|$|E
5|$|Of the 20 bits {{allocated}} for each program instruction, 10 {{were used to}} hold the instruction code, which allowed for 1,024 (210) different instructions. The machine had 26 initially, increasing to 30 when the function codes to programmatically control the data transfer between the magnetic drum and the cathode ray tube (CRT) main store were added. On the Intermediary Version programs were input by key switches, and the output was displayed {{as a series of}} dots and dashes on a cathode ray tube known as the output device, just as on the SSEM from which the Mark 1 had been developed. However, the Final Specification machine, completed in October 1949, benefitted from the addition of a <b>teleprinter</b> with a 5-hole paper-tape reader and punch.|$|E
5|$|The Ostsack (east sack) of the Krivasoo bridgehead, {{defended by}} the Soviet 6th and the 117th Rifle Corps, were {{confused}} by the Strachwitz Battle Group's diversionary attack on 6 April. The attack deceived the Soviet forces into thinking that the German attack intended to cut them out from the west flank. The actual assault came directly at the 59th Army and started with a heavy bombardment. The positions of the 59th Army were attacked by dive bombers and the forest there was set afire. At the same time, the 61st Infantry Division and the Strachwitz tank squadron pierced deep into the 59th Army's defences, splitting the two rifle corps apart and forcing them to retreat to their fortifications. Marshal of the Soviet Union Leonid Govorov was outraged by the news, sending in the freshly re-deployed 8th Army. Their attempt {{to cut off the}} Tiger I tanks was repelled by Lieutenant Günther Famula, who received a posthumous Knight's Cross for these actions, keeping their supply lines open. On 7 April, Govorov ordered his troops to switch on to the defensive. The 59th Army, having lost another 5,700 troops from all causes, was withdrawn from the bridgehead. For these successes Strachwitz received the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds on 15 April 1944. News of the award had reached his headquarters on the early morning of 15 April via <b>teleprinter</b> message. The official presentation was made a few weeks later by Hitler.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} command-line systems combined <b>teleprinters</b> with computers, adapting {{a mature}} technology that had proven effective for mediating {{the transfer of}} information over wires between human beings. <b>Teleprinters</b> had originally been invented as devices for automatic telegraph transmission and reception; they had a history going back to 1902 and had already become well-established in newsrooms and elsewhere by 1920. In reusing them, economy was certainly a consideration, but psychology and the Rule of Least Surprise mattered as well; <b>teleprinters</b> provided a point of interface with the system that was familiar to many engineers and users.|$|R
50|$|In July 1963 the United States sent {{four sets}} of <b>teleprinters</b> with the Latin {{alphabet}} to Moscow for the terminal there. A month later the Soviet equipment, {{four sets of}} East German <b>teleprinters</b> with the Cyrillic alphabet made by Siemens, arrived in Washington. The hotline started operations on August 30, 1963.|$|R
5000|$|Long {{before the}} RS-232 standard, current loops {{were used to}} send digital data in serial form for <b>teleprinters.</b> More than two <b>teleprinters</b> could be {{connected}} on a single circuit allowing a simple form of networking. [...] Older <b>teleprinters</b> used a 60 mA current loop. Later machines, such as the Teletype Model 33, operated on a lower 20 mA current level and most early minicomputers featured a 20 mA current loop interface, with an RS-232 port generally available as a more expensive option. The original IBM PC serial port card had provisions for a 20 mA current loop.|$|R
25|$|From the 1980s, {{teleprinters}} {{were replaced}} by computers running <b>teleprinter</b> emulation software.|$|E
25|$|Landline <b>teleprinter</b> {{operations}} {{began in}} 1849 when a circuit {{was put in}} service between Philadelphia and New York City. Émile Baudot designed a system using a five unit code in 1874 that is still in use today. <b>Teleprinter</b> system design was gradually improved until, {{at the beginning of}} World War II, it represented the principal distribution method used by the news services.|$|E
25|$|A {{radioteletype}} station {{consists of}} three distinct parts: the Teletype or <b>teleprinter,</b> the modem and the radio.|$|E
5000|$|... {{peripheral}} devices (<b>teleprinters,</b> {{punched tape}} reader/punchers, parallel printers and punched card readers).|$|R
50|$|Earlier <b>teleprinters</b> {{had three}} rows of keys and only {{supported}} upper case letters. They used the 5 bit ITA2 code and generally worked at 60 to 100 words per minute. Later <b>teleprinters,</b> specifically the Teletype Model 33, used ASCII code, an innovation {{that came into}} widespread use in the 1960s as computers became more widely available.|$|R
50|$|During the 20th century, {{technicians}} tested typewriters and <b>teleprinters</b> by typing the sentence.|$|R
25|$|When a key of the <b>teleprinter</b> {{keyboard}} is pressed, a 5-bit {{character is}} generated. The <b>teleprinter</b> converts it to serial format and transmits {{a sequence of}} a start bit (a logical 0 or space), then {{one after the other}} the 5 data bits, finishing with a stop bit (a logical 1 or mark, lasting 1, 1.5 or 2 bits). When a sequence of start bit, 5 data bits and stop bit arrives at the input of the <b>teleprinter,</b> it is converted to a 5-bit word and passed to the printer or VDU. With electromechanical teleprinters, these functions required complicated electromechanical devices, but they are easily implemented with standard digital electronics using shift registers. Special integrated circuits have been developed for this function, for example the Intersil 6402 and 6403. These are stand-alone UART devices, similar to computer serial port peripherals.|$|E
25|$|Automatic <b>teleprinter</b> {{exchange}} {{service was}} introduced into Canada by CPR Telegraphs and CN Telegraph in July 1957, and in 1958, Western Union started {{to build a}} Telex network in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Most German {{messages}} decrypted at Bletchley {{were produced}} {{by one or}} another version of the Enigma cipher machine, but an important minority were produced by the even more complicated twelve-rotor Lorenz SZ42 on-line <b>teleprinter</b> cipher machine.|$|E

25|$|Telex {{began in}} Germany as a {{research}} and development program in 1926 that became an operational <b>teleprinter</b> service in 1933. The service was operated by the Reichspost (Reich postal service) and had a speed of 50 baud - approximately 66 words-per-minute.|$|E
25|$|The modem is {{sometimes}} called the terminal unit and is an electronic device which is connected between the <b>teleprinter</b> and the radio transceiver. The transmitting part of the modem converts the digital signal transmitted by the <b>teleprinter</b> or tape reader to {{one or the other}} of a pair of audio frequency tones, traditionally 2295/2125Hz (US) or 2125/1955Hz (Europe). One of the tones corresponds to the mark condition and the other to the space condition. These audio tones, then, modulate an SSB transmitter to produce the final audio-frequency shift keying (AFSK) radio frequency signal. Some transmitters are capable of direct frequency-shift keying (FSK) as they can directly accept the digital signal and change their transmitting frequency according to the mark or space input state. In this case the transmitting part of the modem is bypassed.|$|E
25|$|The 5 {{data bits}} allow for only 32 {{different}} codes, which cannot accommodate the 26 letters, 10 figures, space, a few punctuation marks and the required control codes, such as carriage return, new line, bell, etc. To overcome this limitation, the <b>teleprinter</b> has two states, the unshifted or letters {{state and the}} shifted or numbers or figures state. The change from one state to the other takes place when the special control codes LETTERS and FIGURES are sent from the keyboard or received from the line. In the letters state the <b>teleprinter</b> prints the letters and space while in the shifted state it prints the numerals and punctuation marks. Teleprinters for languages using other alphabets also use an additional third shift state, in which they print letters in the alternative alphabet.|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>teleprinters</b> {{used the}} 5-bit International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2). This limited the {{character}} set to 32 codes (25 = 32). One {{had to use}} a [...] "FIGS" [...] shift key to type numbers and special characters. Special versions of <b>teleprinters</b> had FIGS characters for specific applications, such as weather symbols for weather reports. Print quality was poor by modern standards. The ITA2 code was used asynchronously with start and stop bits: the asynchronous code design was intimately linked with the start-stop electro-mechanical design of <b>teleprinters.</b> (Early systems had used synchronous codes, but were hard to synchronize mechanically). Other codes, such as FIELDATA and Flexowriter, were introduced but never became as popular as ITA2.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike Enigma, Typex I {{machines}} {{were linked to}} <b>teleprinters</b> while Typex II machines could be if required.|$|R
5000|$|News wire {{services}} in the 1920s used multiplex devices that satisfied {{the definition of a}} modem. However, the modem function was incidental to the multiplexing function, so they are not commonly included in the history of modems.Modems grew out of the need to connect <b>teleprinters</b> over ordinary phone lines instead of the more expensive leased lines which had previously been used for current loop-based <b>teleprinters</b> and automated telegraphs.|$|R
25|$|Amateur Radio {{operators}} used various equipment {{designs to}} get on the air using RTTY in the 1950s and 1960s. Amateurs used their existing receivers for RTTY operation but needed to add a terminal unit, sometimes called a demodulator, to convert the received audio signals to DC signals for the <b>teleprinter.</b>|$|E
25|$|WHFV {{signed off}} {{for what would}} be the final time on May 29, 1975 at exactly 4:57:45 pm. At the time, it was so far in debt that it didn't matter that there was no money to pay UPI for the wire service – the staff could not even afford more paper for the <b>teleprinter.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although radio {{programmes}} {{could be}} broadcast nationally by landline, television relay facilities were not {{put in place}} until the early 1960s. This meant that news bulletins had {{to be sent to}} each capital city by <b>teleprinter,</b> to be prepared and presented separately in each city, with filmed materials copied manually and sent to each state.|$|E
50|$|By the 1930s <b>teleprinters</b> {{were being}} {{produced}} by Teletype in the US, Creed in Britain and Siemens in Germany.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Teleprinters</b> {{have largely}} been {{replaced}} by fully electronic computer terminals which usually use a computer monitor instead of a printer (though the term [...] "TTY" [...] is still occasionally {{used to refer to}} them, such as in Unix systems). <b>Teleprinters</b> are still widely used in the aviation industry (AFTN and airline teletype system), and variations called Telecommunications Devices for the Deaf (TDDs) are used by the hearing impaired for typed communications over ordinary telephone lines.|$|R
50|$|Text mode video {{rendering}} came to {{prominence in the}} early 1970s, when video-oriented text terminals started to replace <b>teleprinters</b> in the interactive use of computers.|$|R
