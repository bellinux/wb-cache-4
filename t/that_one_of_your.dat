500|$|Steinitz rated Anderssen {{as one of}} the two {{greatest}} attacking {{players of}} his time: [...] "We all may learn from Morphy and Anderssen how to conduct a king’s-side attack, and perhaps I myself may not have learnt enough." [...] Although Anderssen is regarded {{as a member of the}} [...] "heroic" [...] attacking school, he was not in favor of mindless aggression, for example he said: [...] "Move <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> pieces, which is in the worst plight, unless you can satisfy yourself that you can derive immediate advantage by an attack", a principle more recently labelled [...] "Makogonov's rule". According to Fine, his approach to development was haphazard and he totally failed to understand why Morphy won.|$|E
500|$|In Shiloh, Naylor {{does not}} impart an {{explicit}} meaning of [...] "honesty" [...] to her juvenile readers, journalist Nancy Gilson observed. Instead, she conveys how [...] "confusing and unanswerable" [...] morality is using main character Marty's ethical predicaments and plot twists. To harbor Shiloh from the antagonist Judd and his principled parents, Marty must steal food and tell falsehoods. His dishonest actions {{serve as a}} contrast to his conscientious persona and his benevolent rescuing of the dog. Every night, Marty prays, [...] "Jesus ... which {{do you want me}} to do? Be one hundred percent honest and carry that dog back to Judd so <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> creatures can be kicked and starved all over again, or keep him here and fatten him up to glorify your creation?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir, it {{is better}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> own {{officers}} should be in command. We will divide ourselves between the two parties." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say no more," [...] {{said the}} magistrate; [...] "it shall {{forthwith}} be done--he shall be removed tanquam suspect--I think <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> own phrases, Monkbarns?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad <b>of</b> it, <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> foolish extravagances, sending {{flowers and}} things to girls for whom you don't care two pins," [...] {{continued}} Jo reprovingly.|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> evenings, is it?" [...] Stephen remarked. [...] "No great harm in such doings--nor much good, that I can see. With the Prince of Seyre, eh?" ...|$|R
60|$|THE CAPTAIN. I heard <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> fellows bolted, and ran {{right into}} the jaws of the lion. I laughed. I still laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I came to {{warn you}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> young ladies was going to elope to-night,' replied Mr. Pickwick, from the {{interior}} of the closet.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Colonel Mac-Ivor,' said Waverley, {{without any}} farther salutation, 'I have {{to inform you}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> people has this instant fired at me from a lurking-place.' ...|$|E
60|$|CRAMPTON. That's {{a spoiled}} child, Mr. Valentine. <b>That's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> modern products. When I was her age, I had many a good hiding fresh {{in my memory}} to teach me manners.|$|R
6000|$|FANNY. <b>Thats</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> prettiest {{literary}} attitudes, Mr Trotter; but it doesnt take me in. You see, I'm {{much more}} conscious of what you really are than you are yourself, because weve discussed you thoroughly at Cambridge; and youve never discussed yourself, have you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think I {{quite know}} HOW chicken and salad feel, dear," [...] said Lady Runnybroke with a puzzled air, [...] "but if <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> husband's {{delightful}} American stories, do tell us. I never CAN get Runnybroke {{to tell me}} any, although he roars over them all. And I dare say he gets them all wrong. But look, here comes our luncheon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me, madam: {{no need of}} explanation; {{your own}} fine sense must inform you <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> frowns would be a {{sufficient}} substitute for capital punishment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> waiters requires my attendance," [...] he said, {{in a tone}} not unduly raised {{but still}} fairly audible. [...] "I am Dr. Gilette." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the contrary," [...] Andrew answered, [...] "I {{have reason}} to believe that he would. Isn't <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> guests coming? You had better go and meet her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You evidently don't {{believe in}} the maxim: Act so <b>that</b> every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> actions is capable of being made into a {{universal}} rule." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peacock! Did {{you think}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> glimpse <b>of</b> <b>your</b> black eyes and fine hair would {{make such an}} {{impression}} that I should recognize you again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God bless you, child! {{forgive me}} if I forgot you for a minute, and be sure <b>that</b> not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> kinsfolk is happier to see you here than Uncle Jem." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've had {{the most}} {{interesting}} talk of my life!" [...] she exclaimed, taking her seat beside Willoughby. [...] "D'you realise <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> men is a philosopher and a poet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure, colonel, {{that it will}} be {{a source}} of {{gratification}} to you, to know <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> officers dashed, single handed, right into the midst of a French squadron." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let {{me look at}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> own," [...] said I to the man, {{as though}} it were merely a subject for {{experimental}} inquiry. Larry, accustomed to obedience, took off the shoe and handed it to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} are wrong there," [...] said a Hankow man. [...] "My {{experience}} is that the Indian teas keep better than ours by a long way. But"--turning to me--"if we could only get the China Government {{to take off the}} duties, we could smash Indian tea and every one connected with it. We could lay down tea in Mincing Lane at threepence a pound. No, we do not adulterate our teas. <b>That's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> tricks in India. We get it as pure as yours--every chest in the break equal to sample." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think I am {{likely to}} marry, Henry. I am {{too much in}} love. <b>That</b> is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> aphorisms. I am putting it into practice, as I do {{everything}} that you say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, Christopher: {{really you}} did not. How tired and sad you do look--though I always know {{beforehand}} {{when you are}} in <b>that</b> state: <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> feet has a drag about it as you pass along the pavement outside the window.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But how happens it, judge, <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> {{surprising}} dexterity {{and agility}} should be caught tripping? I had thought you particularly expert, and infallible {{in all the}} gyrations. Perhaps the little affair of the cauda has leaked out?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To me it {{has always}} seemed strange, Bourdon, <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> kind {{feelings}} should ever wish to live alone, at all; yet I have heard you say that a love of solitude first drew you to your trade." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One moment, your Excellency. This young officer, Lieutenant von Holtz, {{has treated}} us kindly and courteously. I {{want you to}} know <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> men, at least, has {{performed}} his duty in a way to merit our thanks--and yours." ...|$|E
60|$|Gr. <b>That's</b> like <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> Grace's paradoxes, such as {{when you}} swore by God {{that you did not}} believe there was any such thing as a God, or Devil; so you swear by nothing, and damn me to no where.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{they went}} to Dr. Tempest, who was also an old man. [...] "Yes, my Lord, I shall be proud to second you," [...] said the rector. [...] "I didn't think that I should ever do <b>that</b> to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> name in Silverbridge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Au Bois," [...] said George Flack to the coachman, {{leaning back}} on the soft cushions. For a few moments after the {{carriage}} had taken its easy elastic start they were silent; but he soon began again. [...] "Was <b>that</b> lady <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> new relatives?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Extremely," [...] he said, stooping {{to pick up}} the fan at her feet. [...] "That is {{the reason}} I am so anxious to conciliate. And you must not forget <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> queens once stepped on the cloak of perhaps such a man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I have {{no wish to}} try,’ said he. ‘And {{yet there}} is one point I cannot {{understand}}: I cannot understand <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> blood and experience should serve the Corsican. I cannot understand it: {{it seems as though}} everything generous in you must rise against that—domination.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have heard," [...] {{continued}} the Queen, through her interpreter, [...] "that {{you have been}} shipwrecked, <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> number is a Maker of Medicine, and that you helped one of my people--even saved his life--soon after your arrival in my country. Is that so?" ...|$|E
60|$|Phor. The dreadful deed was acted but by one; And sure <b>that</b> <b>one</b> {{had much}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> resemblance.|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't a {{doubt of}} it," [...] Vane declared. [...] "On the other hand, I hardly think <b>that</b> even <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> suppers would quite have put right the defect in my {{appearance}} you mentioned. You see, {{the cause of}} it has been at work for some time." ...|$|R
2500|$|Suicide is allowed, i.e., you {{can make}} a play such <b>that</b> <b>one</b> or more <b>of</b> <b>your</b> own stones become marked.|$|R
