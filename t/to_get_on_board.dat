25|$|Rabbi Henoch, as {{he became}} affectionately known, was {{released}} {{just in time}} to escape WWII Europe by catching the very last ship bound for the British Mandate of Palestine. Accompanied by his wife and children he arrived at the port after its departure and was forced to chase the vessel with a small craft <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> The potential dangers of staying in Vienna had been so acute that he was advised by the Rabbi of Altstadt that he should even desecrate the Shabbat if necessary to help him leave, as remaining in Europe would be classed as pikuach nefesh.|$|E
25|$|In 1996 Castrol {{employed}} John Clarke {{who came}} with many {{ideas on how}} to build the Castrol team. His intuition to pick a moment in time to build the Castrol racing team and the Castrol Cougars for women racers was a head of its time. In 1997 John made a pact with Larry Perkins. Perkins role was to beat Brock in his retirement year. Larry and Russell did it. With increased money from Castrol and John Clarke who encouraged associated sponsors <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> Perkins Engineering finally expanded to two cars. Peter was a great supporter of the cougars. For the record they came 13th in two Bathurst 1000 assaults.|$|E
25|$|As {{a kind of}} benefit, {{overseas}} {{civil servants}} in Hong Kong were entitled to a free exclusive sea passage when they retired. Norman-Walker was eligible and chose to enjoy the benefit when he left Hong Kong on 30 September 1973. He was supposed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> an ocean liner like his counterparts, {{but it turned out}} that there was no ocean liner calling at Hong Kong {{at the time of his}} departure. As a result, he was forced to enjoy the entitlement on a cargo ship. On his departure, in the presence of the members of the Executive and Legislative Councils and senior government officials, Norman-Walker boarded Lady Maurine from HMS Tamar and travelled across the Victoria Harbour to the Kowloon side. From there he travelled to Kwai Chung Container Port and boarded the cargo ship, which sailed for Britain.|$|E

25|$|In 211, {{during the}} Battle of Tong Pass against a {{coalition}} of northwestern warlords led by Ma Chao and Han Sui, Cao Cao led his troops north across the Ji River (濟河) {{in an attempt to}} circle {{to the rear of the}} enemy. The bulk of Cao Cao's troops had already crossed the river, leaving Cao and his Tiger Warriors to bring up the rear. Just then, Ma Chao and his 10,000 horsemen caught up with them. As the enemies were approaching fast, Cao Cao's soldiers rushed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the ferry, which was on the verge of sinking under the weight. Xu Chu held up a saddle with his left hand to shield Cao Cao from arrows and carried a sword in his right hand, using it to slash enemy soldiers trying to clamber onto the vessel. By then, the boatman had been killed by arrows, so Xu Chu, still holding up the saddle with his left hand, used his other hand to grab a bargepole and push the ferry away from the ford to safety.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the months}} before the {{resumption}} of war with France, the Navy started preparations that included impressing seamen. The crews of outbound Indiamen were an attractive target. Woodford and [...] {{were sitting in the}} Thames in March 1803, taking their crews on board just prior to sailing. At sunset, a press gang from HMS Immortalite rowed up to Woodford, while boats from [...] and [...] approached Ganges. As the press gangs approached they were noticed, and the crews of both Indiamen were piped to quarters. That is, they assembled on the decks armed with pikes and cutlasses, and anything they could throw. The officers in charge of the press gangs thought this mere bravado and pulled alongside the Indiamen, only to meet a severe resistance from the crewmen, who had absolutely no desire to serve in the Royal Navy. The men from Immortalite suffered several injuries from shot and pike that were thrown at them, and eventually the marines opened fire with muskets, killing two sailors on Woodford. Even so, the press gangs were not able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> either Indiaman, and eventually withdrew some distance. When Woodfords officers finally permitted the press gang from Immortalite to board, all they found on board were a few sickly sailors.|$|E

5000|$|Manager Steve Cuggy commented [...] "We delighted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Richard <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> He has {{electric}} {{pace and}} this {{will give us a}} different dimension to our attack, as well as offering us additional firepower upfront, which a couple of injuries have sadly robbed us of." ...|$|R

50|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> one of {{the stone}} markers <b>on</b> the <b>board,</b> the player tosses five {{specially}} prepared black beans on the game area. Each black bean has one side marked with a hole. Thus tossing the black beans would result in several black beans showing this white mark and others showing a blank side. In order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the game <b>board,</b> one black bean would have to land with the hole face up {{and all the others}} face down (getting a score of one).
