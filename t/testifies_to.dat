5|$|A {{commercial}} document from 30 January 1359, which <b>testifies</b> <b>to</b> John's continuing {{trade relations with}} Venice, is chronologically the last reference to his activity in contemporary sources. While the date of his death was not recorded, {{it is likely that}} John perished during the plague epidemic which hit Valona and Durazzo (today Durrës) in 1363.|$|E
5|$|Back at FBI headquarters, Scully <b>testifies</b> <b>to</b> Skinner {{that she}} {{believes}} Mulder is mentally sound and fit for duty, noting that Pincus {{and several others}} mysteriously disappeared, {{that there was an}} intruder in Mulder's room, and that Backus did have some sort of chemical in his system. Afterward she tells Mulder that she said it was Folie à deux, and describes it as 'a madness shared by two'. But she does not specify who the two were.|$|E
5|$|Llandaff Cathedral {{was built}} on the site of an {{existing}} church. According to tradition, the community was established by Saint Dubricius at a ford on the River Taff and the first church was founded by Dubricius' successor, Saint Teilo. These two are regarded as the cathedral's patron saints, along with their successor Oudoceus. The original church is no longer extant, but a standing Celtic cross <b>testifies</b> <b>to</b> the presence of Christian worship at the site in pre-Norman times.|$|E

5|$|The {{remains of}} the Byzantine-era church in Jifna <b>testifies</b> <b>to</b> the {{existence}} of a Christian community prior to the Muslim conquest. It continued to exist during the Middle Ages and the village is still inhabited mainly by Christians. The names of Christian inhabitants from Jifna appeared in a 10th-century inscription on a stone above the gate of St. George's Monastery in the Wadi Qelt.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} in 1987 of a primitive tomb at Mondeval de Sora {{high up in}} the mountains to the south of Cortina <b>testifies</b> <b>to</b> the presence of Mesolithic man in the area {{as far back as the}} 6th millennium B.C. In the 6th century B.C., Etruscan writing was introduced in the province of Cadore, in whose possession is remained until the early 15th century. From the 3rd century B.C., the Romans assimilated the Veneti people, giving the area the name of Amplitium (from amplus meaning wide), today's Ampezzo.|$|E
5|$|The sculptors {{very likely}} also {{operated}} in Brescia because Bartolomeo {{was known to}} have resided there at least between 1501 and 1503, and such a long presence can be justified only by admitting the existence of significant local commissions. There {{is reason to believe}} that the Sanmicheli organisation should have deeper roots in Brescia during the two years mentioned, ranging from the construction of dei Miracoli to that of the Loggia. With the Loggia, however, the mature talent of Cairano broke into the Brescian art scene, and his powerful sculptural sequence of the Caesars <b>testifies</b> <b>to</b> the decline of the Sanmicheli, whose ornate style was no longer of interest to the municipality and nobility.|$|E

5|$|In 1349, John plundered a Venetian {{commercial}} ship {{which had}} been shipwrecked on the coast he controlled, {{in accordance with the}} medieval principle of jus naufragii. This act necessitated the involvement of Stephen Dušan in order to settle the dispute between Venice and John, as evidenced by an official document from 13 April 1350. Despite this conflict, under John the Principality of Valona was an active partner of Venice and Ragusa (modern Dubrovnik) in maritime commerce. Two receipts from 27 April 1350 document John's role as a mediator in cattle, sugar and pepper trade and reveal that he received significant income from the Valona customs. The customs was profitable because the port was often visited by merchant ships. Even though all of these documents were written in Slavic, John signed his name in Greek, which <b>testifies</b> <b>to</b> his Hellenisation. At the time, John also had ties with the Mamluk rulers of Egypt, who addressed him as “King of Serbia and Bulgaria” in correspondence.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Euler {{was asked}} to tutor Friederike Charlotte of Brandenburg-Schwedt, the Princess of Anhalt-Dessau and Frederick's niece. Euler wrote over 200 letters {{to her in the}} early 1760s, which were later {{compiled}} into a best-selling volume entitled Letters of Euler on different Subjects in Natural Philosophy Addressed to a German Princess. This work contained Euler's exposition on various subjects pertaining to physics and mathematics, as well as offering valuable insights into Euler's personality and religious beliefs. This book became more widely read than any of his mathematical works, and was published across Europe and in the United States. The popularity of the 'Letters' <b>testifies</b> <b>to</b> Euler's ability to communicate scientific matters effectively to a lay audience, a rare ability for a dedicated research scientist.|$|E
5|$|Long epic poetry was not {{a popular}} genre in North Korea before Mt. Paektu, {{but it was in}} the Soviet Union where Cho had immigrated from. Poema and Mayakovsky's prosody and poetry were also among Cho's {{influences}} that can be seen in Mt. Paektu. These Russian stylistic influences gave Mt. Paektu its peculiar characteristics that prompted mixed reactions from the North Korean public. For instance, some in the literature circles were unfamiliar with the concept of a lyrical epic and thought of it as an improbable amalgam of genres, criticizing the work for being indistinguishable from ordinary prose. According to North Korean studies scholar Alzo David-West, the relatively favorable reaction to Mt. Paektu compared to some other literature <b>testifies</b> <b>to</b> North Korean readership being capable at being both a receptive and a dismissive audience.|$|E

5|$|The picture {{painted by}} the few and {{scattered}} {{references to the}} Cretan emirate from the Muslim world, on the other hand, is of an ordered state with a regular monetary economy and extensive trade links, and {{there is evidence that}} Chandax was a cultural centre of some importance. The survival of numerous gold, silver, and copper coins, of almost constant weight and composition, <b>testifies</b> <b>to</b> a strong economy and a high living standard among the population. The economy was strengthened by extensive trade {{with the rest of the}} Muslim world, especially with Egypt, and by a booming agriculture: the need to sustain an independent state, as well as access to the markets of the Muslim world, led to an intensification of cultivation. It is also possible that sugar cane was introduced to Crete at the time.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the first act, the judge asks the court clerk to call jurors from the audience. Once the jurors are seated, the prosecution argument begins. Flint explains that Andre was not just Faulkner's secretary, but also his lover. He says Faulkner jilted her to marry Nancy Lee Whitfield and fired Andre, motivating Andre to murder him. Flint then calls a series of witnesses, starting with the medical examiner, who testifies that Faulkner's body was so damaged by the fall {{that it was impossible to}} determine whether he was killed by the impact or was already dead. An elderly night watchman and a private investigator describe the events they saw that evening. A police inspector <b>testifies</b> <b>to</b> finding a suicide note. Faulkner's very religious housekeeper disapprovingly describes the sexual relationship between Andre and Faulkner, and says she saw Andre with another man after Faulkner's marriage. Nancy Lee testifies about her and Faulkner's courtship and marriage, portraying both as idyllic. The act ends with Andre speaking out of turn to accuse Nancy Lee of lying.|$|E
5|$|Weevil (Francis Capra) organizes {{a meeting}} between Veronica and the PCHers, and the new leader says {{that they would not}} kill someone over a bad car like the Coach's vehicle. Mason (Robert Ri'chard), one of the team's former star {{basketball}} players, <b>testifies</b> <b>to</b> Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) that Josh is responsible for his father’s death. The Sheriff arrests Josh, and Veronica learns that the Coach's car was found in the water. Logan and Heather begin to actually enjoy each other's company. Keith speaks to Mindy O'Dell (Jaime Ray Newman), stating that he will continue to search for Dean Cyrus O'Dell's killer. Veronica questions Mason, but he ends up angrily walking away. Veronica and Keith recuperate, and Keith says that Cyrus's car was taken out within the timeframe of the murder. Heather sends a radio request to play a special song from Logan to Veronica, while Veronica interrogates the hotel staff. One of them says that he heard two men yelling in the room. Veronica and Logan have a chance meeting in the elevator.|$|E
