5|$|For Steiner, all of offers, {{threats and}} throffers affect the {{practical}} deliberations of their recipient {{in the same}} way. What is significant for the subject of <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> is not {{the extent to which}} the consequences of compliance or noncompliance differ in desirability from the norm, but {{the extent to which the}}y differ in desirability from each other. Thus, an offer does not necessarily exert less influence on its recipient than a threat. The strength of the force exerted by an intervention depends upon the difference in desirability between compliance and noncompliance alone, regardless of the manner of <b>the</b> <b>intervention.</b>|$|E

40|$|Sterilized foreign {{exchange}} market interventions have been suspected of being inefficient by many empirical studies, but they are plagued by endogeneity problems. To solve the problems, this paper identifies a system that depicts interactions between <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> and <b>the</b> {{foreign exchange}} rate. The model shows that <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> are effective when <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> alter <b>the</b> market participants' conditional expectations of the rate without decreasing the conditional variances. This paper estimates Markov-switching type policy reaction functions by conditional MLE, and market demand/supply curves by IV estimation with generated regressors. The empirical results verify that <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> of <b>the</b> Bank of Korea from 2001 to 2002 were indeed effective.

40|$|Efforts to {{disseminate}} empirically-supported treatments (ESTs) for maltreated children {{are confronted with}} numerous challenges, {{and the success of}} these efforts is unclear. The current study reports on the results of a nationwide survey of 262 clinicians serving maltreated children in the United States. From a provided list, clinicians were asked to identify interventions they believed possessed adequate empirical support, as well as <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> they commonly used, were trained to use, or would like to receive training to use. Results showed that clinicians generally are unable to identify ESTs, and many of <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> clinicians reported most commonly using and being trained to use are not typically considered to be empirically-supported (with the exception of Trauma-Focused Cognitive–Behavioral Therapy). Greater ability to accurately identify ESTs was predicted by favorable attitudes toward evidence-based practice; however, beliefs that non-ESTs were empirically-supported were best predicted by training background (e. g., professional discipline, education level, and theoretical orientation). Finally, regression analyses found that <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> clinicians identified as empirically-supported predicted <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> in which clinicians received training, which in turn predicted <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> commonly used.
