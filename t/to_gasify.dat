50|$|In August 1933 {{the works}} on {{construction}} of gas supply piping from Zagłębie Lwowskie and Krośnieńskie to Mościce were started. The investment {{was a part}} of the gasification program for the Central Industrial District. The works connected with supplying gas to Mościce were completed in 1937. At first, gas was used to burn boilers of the power plant in the factory, which contributed to decrease in transport and coal storage costs. Next, the tests of methane decomposition in generators were conducted. Upon achievement of positive results, the hydrogen content in raw gas increased, which contributed to the increase in ammonia production by ca. 10% in Mościce. It also initiated the start of using natural as the primary material, at the same time, decreasing the production costs. At the end of 30’s of XX c. the ammonia production in factory in Mościce was based on gas obtained from the generators gasifying coke and, additionally, two generators adjusted <b>to</b> <b>gasifying</b> coke and methane.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{amounts of}} people that are {{overweight}} have been increasing within the population in significant ways during the last decades. In this view, gasified beverages have become an important environmental concern in relation to the eating habits of people, especially who lives in the USA, Mexico, and Brazil. In this order, these three countries constitute the major beverages producers and consumers of the whole world. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of gastric dilatation in rats submitted <b>to</b> <b>gasified</b> water ingestion, uniform vehicle for all soft drinks, under metabolic patterns of the hepatic function. METHODS: Two groups of 15 rats were formed and observed during two weeks. The rats of the group I, were fed with 200 g/day of rat food ad libitum and 100 ml of non-gasified water during three daily periods. The rats composing the group II, were fed with 200 g/day of rat food ad libitum and 100 ml of gasified water within 3 daily periods. The media (x) and standard deviation (s) were calculated through the paired t-test for each group in order to compare the effects of the different types of water and its effect in each one of them. RESULTS: The results indicated that the animals which were submitted to the treatment with gasified water (G-II), presented an increase of glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (p p> 0, 05) and increase of the gastric area with macroscopic morphologic alterations, such as the loss of the characteristic linear depressions {{on the surface of the}} mucous membrane. CONCLUSION: The gasified water favored the expansion of the gastric area and contributed to the extinction of the linear depressions of the mucous organ, which caused metabolic alterations of the hepatic function...|$|R

5000|$|The {{most recent}} {{evolution}} of Bergius' {{work is the}} 2-stage hydroliquefaction plant at [...] Wilsonville AL which operated during 1981-85. Here a coal extract was prepared under heat and hydrogen pressure using finely pulverized coal and recycle donor solvent. As the coal molecule is broken down, free radicals are formed which are immediately stabilized by absorption of H atoms from the donor solvent. Extract then passes to a catalytic ebullated-bed hydrocracker (H-Oil unit) fed by additional hydrogen, forming lower molecular weight hydrocarbons and splitting off sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen originally present in the coal. Part of the liquid product is hydrogenated donor solvent which is returned to Stage I. The balance of liquid product is fractionated by distillation yielding various boiling range products and an ashy residue. Ashy residue goes to a Kerr-McGee CSDA unit which yields additional liquid product and a high-ash material containing unreacted coal and heavy residuum, which in a commercial plant would be <b>gasified</b> <b>to</b> make the H2 needed to feed the process. Parameters can be adjusted <b>to</b> avoid directly <b>gasifying</b> any of the coal entering the plant.
