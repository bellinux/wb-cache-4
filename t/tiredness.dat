5|$|Research into BZP's {{tolerance}} is sparse. Anecdotal {{evidence from}} online sources claim tolerance {{to the central}} action of BZP will develop quickly. Due to <b>tiredness</b> associated with the body's recovery from stimulants, such as BZP, it is uncommon for users {{to be able to}} sustain a week-long intake.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} another {{significant}} difference in Napoleon himself, {{in the way he}} holds himself. David's Napoleon is flamboyant, confident in his leadership of the French army, and in his ability to cross the Alps and defeat the Austrians in Italy. Delaroche's Napoleon is instead downcast, gaunt and embittered by the harsh cold. His eyes and expressionless face evidence his weariness, his <b>tiredness</b> a result of the long and unstable trek.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism, {{also called}} underactive thyroid or low thyroid, {{is a common}} {{disorder}} of the endocrine {{system in which the}} thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of <b>tiredness,</b> constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called cretinism.|$|E
5|$|Kristoff, meanwhile, {{expressed}} {{disappointment with}} his second-place finish and {{his failure to}} defend his 2014 title. He suggested that another rider in the final part of the race could have given a better result, as Paolini's <b>tiredness</b> after a long spell {{at the front of}} the race meant that Kristoff had to start his sprint too early. Michael Matthews's third-place finish was the most significant result of his career, but he too was disappointed at having fallen short, after feeling strong on the climb of the Poggio.|$|E
5|$|The affective {{subscale}} contains eight items: pessimism, past failures, guilty feelings, punishment feelings, self-dislike, self-criticalness, suicidal {{thoughts or}} wishes, and worthlessness. The somatic subscale {{consists of the}} other thirteen items: sadness, loss of pleasure, crying, agitation, loss of interest, indecisiveness, loss of energy, change in sleep patterns, irritability, change in appetite, concentration difficulties, <b>tiredness</b> and/or fatigue, and loss of interest in sex. The two subscales were moderately correlated at 0.57, suggesting that the physical and psychological aspects of depression are related rather than totally distinct.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} hypothyroidism (lack of production of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the thyroid). Typical symptoms are <b>tiredness,</b> intolerance to cold, constipation, weight gain, hair loss and slowed thinking, {{as well as}} a slowed heart rate and low blood pressure. In children, hypothyroidism leads to delayed growth and in extreme inborn forms to a syndrome called cretinism.|$|E
5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical {{symptoms}} are abnormal weight gain, <b>tiredness,</b> constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency {{is the most}} common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis {{is the most common}} cause in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some forms of hypothyroidism can result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma.|$|E
5|$|Crohn's {{disease is}} a type of {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. Signs and symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), fever, and weight loss. Other complications may occur outside the gastrointestinal tract and include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and <b>tiredness.</b> The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction also commonly occurs and those with the disease are at greater risk of bowel cancer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} {{and even as}} late as 1987, Solidarity was seen by many, {{including}} most of its activists, as likely {{a thing of the}} past. It persisted solely as a rather small underground organization, supported by various international institutions, from the Catholic Church to the Central Intelligence Agency. When most senior Solidarity figures were interned or otherwise neutralized by the authorities, Zbigniew Bujak, head of the Union's Warsaw branch, remained in hiding and was the leader of the clandestine organization until his arrest in 1986. But the post-martial law general public showed signs of <b>tiredness</b> and disappointment, as it had become apparent that Solidarity was not a united front.|$|E
5|$|In the {{remainder}} of the season, Crawford scored 232 against Somerset, his highest first-class score, as well as centuries against Derbyshire and Hampshire. The increased strength and variety of Surrey's bowling attack restricted his opportunities; he was used less as a strike bowler and bowled fewer overs than in the previous season. Contemporary reports suggested that his performances tailed off as the season progressed, possibly through <b>tiredness</b> from having played too much cricket, and that he became a less accurate bowler through trying too hard to spin the ball. The Surrey captaincy remained unsettled; Crawford led the team on several occasions, including Surrey's final game of the season, when his brother Vivian captained Leicestershire, their opponents.|$|E
5|$|Malaria is a mosquito-borne {{infectious}} disease affecting humans {{and other animals}} caused by parasitic protozoans (a group of single-celled microorganisms) belonging to the Plasmodium type. Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, <b>tiredness,</b> vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later. In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms. This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{disease may}} present itself as <b>tiredness,</b> {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, {{a condition in}} which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E

25|$|Fatigue Points (FP): {{a measure}} of exertion, <b>tiredness,</b> and hunger, based on HT in 4e. In {{previous}} editions {{it was based on}} ST.|$|E
25|$|Tolfenamic acid, an {{inhibitor}} of prostaglandin synthesis, in a 1983 study reduced headache, nausea, vomiting, irritation but had {{no effect}} on <b>tiredness</b> in 30 people.|$|E
25|$|Political {{scientist}} Bronwyn Hayward, {{a lecturer}} at the University of Canterbury, predicted a poor turnout {{based on the}} one-sidedness of the race, and <b>tiredness</b> of the voting populations due to earthquake-induced stress.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who survive}} often have ongoing muscular and joint pain, liver inflammation, {{decreased}} hearing, {{and may have}} continued <b>tiredness,</b> continued weakness, decreased appetite, and difficulty returning to pre-illness weight. Problems with vision may develop.|$|E
25|$|Common: <b>Tiredness,</b> sleep {{disturbances}} (6%) and gastrointestinal disturbances (6%) {{have been reported}} during clinical trials with isosorbide mononitrate modified-release tablets, but at a frequency no greater than for placebo. Hypotension (4 to 5%), poor appetite (2.5%), nausea (1%).|$|E
25|$|In the United States Forest Service {{the use of}} {{chainsaws}} and crosscut saws requires training and certification. A great deal of that training describes situational awareness as an approach toward environmental awareness but also self-awareness which includes being aware of one's own emotional attitude, <b>tiredness,</b> and even caloric intake.|$|E
25|$|A Factories Inquiry Commission of 1833 {{found that}} {{children}} working in the mills were often too tired to eat and, when woken in the morning, unable to dress themselves. Scotland was considered the worst area for child cruelty and their <b>tiredness</b> often caused serious accidents with the machinery.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include headache, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, {{decreased}} appetite, constipation, dry mouth, and abdominal pain. More severe side effects are severe allergic reactions, chest pain, dark urine, fast heartbeat, fever, paresthesia, persistent sore throat, severe stomach pain, unusual bruising or bleeding, unusual <b>tiredness,</b> and yellowing {{of the eyes}} or skin.|$|E
25|$|KLS can be {{diagnosed}} {{when there is}} confusion, apathy, or derealization in addition to frequent bouts of extreme <b>tiredness</b> and prolonged sleep. The earliest it can {{be diagnosed}} is the second episode, this is not common. The condition is generally treated as a diagnosis of exclusion. Because KLS is rare, other conditions with similar symptoms are usually considered first.|$|E
25|$|Mold in {{the home}} can usually be found in damp, dark or steamy areas e.g. {{bathroom}} or kitchen, cluttered storage areas, recently flooded areas, basement areas, plumbing spaces, areas with poor ventilation and outdoors in humid environments. Symptoms caused by mold allergy are watery, itchy eyes, a chronic cough, headaches or migraines, difficulty breathing, rashes, <b>tiredness,</b> sinus problems, nasal blockage and frequent sneezing.|$|E
25|$|The Singapore {{government}} held {{a public}} {{inquiry into the}} accident under Mr. Justice Knight from 31 May to 16 August. The accident was attributed to poor execution of the approach due to crew <b>tiredness,</b> which exacerbated the pilot's decision to touch down {{near the end of}} the runway. The inquiry determined that, at the time of arrival in Singapore, Captain Hoyle had been on duty for 21½ hours since the flight departed Sydney.|$|E
25|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} {{is a collection}} of signs and symptoms due to prolonged exposure to cortisol. Signs and symptoms may include high blood pressure, abdominal obesity but with thin arms and legs, reddish stretch marks, a round red face, a fat lump between the shoulders, weak muscles, weak bones, acne, and fragile skin that heals poorly. Women may have more hair and irregular menstruation. Occasionally there may be changes in mood, headaches, and a chronic feeling of <b>tiredness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Deficiency of {{magnesium}} can cause <b>tiredness,</b> generalized weakness, muscle cramps, abnormal heart rhythms, increased irritability {{of the nervous}} system with tremors, paresthesias, palpitations, hypokalemia, hypoparathyroidism which might result in hypocalcemia, chondrocalcinosis, spasticity and tetany, epileptic seizures, basal ganglia calcifications and in extreme and prolonged cases coma, intellectual disability or death. Other symptoms that have been suggested to be associated with hypomagnesemia are athetosis, jerking, nystagmus, and an extensor plantar reflex, confusion, disorientation, hallucinations, depression, hypertension and fast heart rate.|$|E
25|$|Fibromyalgia (FM) is {{a medical}} {{condition}} characterised by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure. Other symptoms include <b>tiredness</b> {{to a degree that}} normal activities are affected, sleep problems, and troubles with memory. Some people also report restless legs syndrome, bowel or bladder problems, numbness and tingling, and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature. Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} interlude {{was provided}} by Hibs' participation as the Toronto-based franchise in the United Soccer Association. The team was known as Toronto City and eventually finished a 13-game summer league third in their division. Hibs opened the season by drawing 1–1 against Cerro Porteno at Yankee Stadium. Pat Stanton later praised the organisation and facilities provided by the league, although conceding {{that it was a}} long trip, causing some <b>tiredness</b> (it was played between domestic league seasons) and homesickness.|$|E
25|$|Heart failure (HF), often {{referred}} to as congestive heart failure (CHF), occurs when the heart is unable to pump sufficiently to maintain blood flow to meet the body's needs. Signs and symptoms commonly include shortness of breath, excessive <b>tiredness,</b> and leg swelling. The shortness of breath is usually worse with exercise, while lying down, and may wake the person at night. A limited ability to exercise is also a common feature. Chest pain, including angina, does not typically occur due to heart failure.|$|E
25|$|Fatigue is a {{subjective}} feeling of <b>tiredness</b> which {{is distinct from}} weakness, and has a gradual onset. Unlike weakness, fatigue can be alleviated by periods of rest. Fatigue can have physical or mental causes. Physical fatigue is the transient inability of a muscle to maintain optimal physical performance, and is made more severe by intense physical exercise. Mental fatigue is a transient decrease in maximal cognitive performance resulting from prolonged periods of cognitive activity. It can manifest as somnolence, lethargy, or directed attention fatigue.|$|E
25|$|When Jack London wrote Martin Eden at age 33, he {{had already}} {{achieved}} international acclaim with The Call of the Wild, The Sea-Wolf and White Fang. Despite the acclaim, London quickly became disillusioned with his fame and set sail through the South Pacific on a self-designed ketch called the Snark. On the grueling two-year voyage—as he struggled with <b>tiredness</b> and bowel diseases—he wrote Martin Eden, filling its pages with his frustrations, adolescent gangfights and struggles for artistic recognition. The character of Ruth Morse was modelled on Mabel Applegarth— the first love of London's life.|$|E
25|$|Infectious {{mononucleosis}} (IM), {{also known}} as mono, is an infection commonly caused by the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). Most people are infected by the virus as children, when the disease produces little or no symptoms. In young adults, the disease often results in fever, sore throat, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, and <b>tiredness.</b> Most people get better in two to four weeks; however, feeling tired may last for months. The liver or spleen may also become swollen. In {{less than one percent}} of cases splenic rupture may occur.|$|E
25|$|A British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Lockheed L-749A Constellation {{crashed and}} caught fire as it {{attempted}} {{to land at}} Singapore-Kallang Airport on 13 March 1954, killing 33 of the 40 passengers and crew. The accident occurred when the aircraft struck a seawall on approach to the runway. The inquiry attributed this to crew <b>tiredness,</b> noting that the captain had been on duty for over 21 hours. It also criticised {{the response of the}} airport fire unit. This is the highest death toll of any aviation accident in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|At maximal doses, and {{sometimes}} at much lower doses, {{side effects of}} iodide used for medical reasons, in doses of 1000 times the normal nutritional need, may include: acne, loss of appetite, or upset stomach (especially during the first several days, as the body adjusts to the medication). More severe side effects which require notification of a physician are: fever, weakness, unusual <b>tiredness,</b> swelling in the neck or throat, mouth sores, skin rash, nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, irregular heartbeat, numbness or tingling of the hands or feet, or a metallic taste in the mouth.|$|E
