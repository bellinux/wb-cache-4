40|$|The {{traditional}} view <b>of</b> oral <b>reading</b> {{ability in}} patients with dementia holds {{that it is a}} preserved skill even if there is a general impairment to lexico-semantic processing ability. Recently, this view has been challenged by studies showing that <b>the</b> oral <b>reading</b> ability <b>of</b> patients with dementia can deteriorate {{over the course of the}} disease. These studies have found that <b>the</b> oral <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> irregular English words is more prone to error than <b>the</b> oral <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> regular words by patients with dementia suggesting that <b>the</b> oral <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> irregular words depends upon support from semantic memory. Relatively little is known about <b>the</b> oral <b>reading</b> abilities <b>of</b> Chinese-speaking dementia patients. This paper reports on the results of a study of the language processing and <b>the</b> oral <b>reading</b> ability <b>of</b> Chinese speakers with probable dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT). DAT patients displayed impairment on tests <b>of</b> oral <b>reading</b> as well as impairment on tests of semantic memory, confrontation naming and word comprehension. The results also show significant effects of regularity, frequency and imageability on <b>the</b> oral <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> DAT patients. It is argued that Chinese-speaking DAT patients display a pattern of language impairment similar to their English-speaking counterparts and, moreover, that normal oral <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> Chinese characters may depend critically upon the integrity of semantic memory. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Although this hypothesis did not prove to be statistically significant, the following tendency was observed: the easier the readability of the book, the more likely it was to have been <b>read.</b> <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> this study indicate fourth grade students chose books from their school library on all their reading levels.

5|$|It {{was common}} for Christie to greet a {{returning}} submarine at the pier, and to award decorations {{to the crew}} on the spot. This bypassed naval award boards, and annoyed Kinkaid and Lockwood, possibly because confirmation of sinkings was accomplished by Ultra, <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> coded Japanese radio traffic, and news of awards given so quickly could constitute a security breach. Complicating the matter was the fact MacArthur awarded army decorations to naval personnel; like Christie, he {{took it upon himself}} to authorize the decorations rather than to go through the standard review procedures. These events compelled Kinkaid to forbid Christie to give pierside awards, and to keep Christie from recommending the award of army medals to navy personnel. These events would ultimately contribute to Christie's dismissal as Commander of Submarines in Fremantle.|$|E

5|$|Although clepsydrae {{were more}} useful than sundials—they {{could be used}} indoors, during the night, and also when the sky was cloudy—they were not as {{accurate}}; the Greeks, therefore, sought a way to improve their water clocks. Although still not as accurate as sundials, Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325, and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand, making <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> the clock more precise and convenient. One of the more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by water pressure: when the container holding the water was full, the increased pressure caused the water to flow more rapidly. This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman horologists beginning in 100, and improvements continued {{to be made in}} the following centuries. To counteract the increased water flow, the clock's water containers—usually bowls or jugs—were given a conical shape; positioned with the wide end up, a greater amount of water had to flow out in order to drop the same distance as when the water was lower in the cone. Along with this improvement, clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period, with hours marked by gongs, doors opening to miniature figurines, bells, or moving mechanisms. There were some remaining problems, however, which were never solved, such as the effect of temperature. Water flows more slowly when cold, or may even freeze.|$|E
