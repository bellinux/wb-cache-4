The {{goal of this}} system is to achieve a nadir pointing accuracy {{on the order of}} 0. 1 to 1. 0 deg without the need for thrusters or wheels. The open-loop system is under-actuated because magnetic <b>torque</b> <b>rods</b> cannot <b>torque</b> about the local magnetic field direction. This direction moves in space as the spacecraft moves along an inclined orbit, and the resulting system is roughly periodic. Periodic controllers are designed using an asymptotic linear quadratic regulator technique. The control laws include integral action and saturation logic. This system's performance has been studied via analysis and simulation. The resulting closed-loop systems are robust with respect to parametric modeling uncertainty.

LionSat will map plasma densities in the ram and wake of the vehicle’s path, using two hybrid plasma probes that rotate with the spacecraft. Attitude will be determined {{using a combination of}} voltage out-puts from contiguous solar panels and a three-axis magnetometer (TAM). To correct for spin-axis drift due to orbital plane nodal regression (approximately five degrees per day), two magnetic <b>torque</b> <b>rods</b> will provide the necessary control actuation.

40|$|One of {{the most}} important, yet complex, and {{expensive}} subsystems for virtually any spacecraft mission is the attitude determination and control subsystem (ADCS). Many payloads require precision ADCS to achieve the desired performance; however, such precision is typically cost-prohibitive for small spacecraft.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedDesign requirements {{for a small}} satellite (NPSAT- 1) Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADCS) is a three-axis stabilized spacecraft which requires a control attitude of +/- 1. 0 degrees and knowledge attitude of +/- 0. 1 degree. Several design aspects are considered in development of attitude control systems for a small satellite, such as: spacecraft dynamics, space environment, disturbance torques, orbit type, and spacecraft complexity. The ideal spacecraft's attitude sensor is a rate gyroscope, which provides rate information to the attitude control system. In the case of NPSAT- 1, due to budget constraints alternative sensors will be utilized, such as: a three-axis magnetometer, earth sensors, and a Global Positioning System (GPS). A small satellite designed to have a three-axis stabilized, biased momentum system, must have a robust control system and requires a momentum wheel to provide stiffness to maintain attitude, and magnetic <b>torque</b> <b>rods</b> on each axis. The current design of NPSAT- 1 uses all of these sensors to provide rate information for damping and stability to the control system that requires a complicated attitude control design. The purpose of this attitude control design simulation is to investigate and propose a control law utilizing a single pitch momentum wheel and three magnetic <b>torque</b> <b>rods.</b> A further proposal is to utilize a constant speed momentum wheel to avoid momentum damping and over speed, replace the pitch control with magnetic torquers, and develop a Kalman filter estimator to provide all the required angular rates.

This thesis will examine the performance of three combinations of programs and simulation models for the NPSAT 1 satellite attitude control system. The models include a magnetic control law with a reduced order estimator to generate torque commands to achieve spacecraft nadir pointing and a magnetic rate (Bdot) control law to reduce spacecraft angular rates. The performances of two Bdot mode switching designs are compared. Also, a case is made for the benefits of priming the systemÎ±s reduced estimator prior to mode switching. All of the control methods analyzed appear to be valid control methods to achieve three-axis attitude stabilization using only magnetic torquers for active control.

The current development process includes development of requirements in-house and component design by an external supplier. To reduce the development lead-time and cost Volvo Cars is investigating the possibilities to do component design of powertrain mounts in-house. It is suggested to use structural optimization as a tool in the design work. A method for using structural optimization to design the geometry of powertrain mounts to meet stiffness specifications has been developed in this project. The project focused on shape optimization of torque rods to meet static stiffness requirement. An iterative approach was used, where the optimization method was developed using a simplified <b>torque</b> <b>rod</b> to facilitate the development. It was also studied if it is possible to obtain material parameters to sufficiently accurate model rubber materials by doing tensile tests on rubber from existing components. Finally, the optimization method was applied to a real Volvo <b>torque</b> <b>rod</b> for validation and adjustment. The proposed optimization method is based on finite element (FE) modelling of the mount. A concept geometry and a requirement stiffness curve are needed as input to the method. An FE model of the concept geometry is created and then morphed, creating shapes that are used as design variables. The morphing enables controlled geometry changes that are used in the optimization. An objective function, that represents the sum of the squared distances that a certain design’s displacement values for certain force levels deviates from the required displacement values, is used to determine the goodness of the design. The shape of the FE model is then optimized by changing the shapes to minimizing the value of the objective function. The output from the optimization method is an optimized mount geometry that can be used as basis in final design work. The proposed method is performing well; it is able to optimize a concept geometry far from the final geometry into a shape that has a static stiffness close to the required. It is also able to fine-tune the shape of a full-feature geometry to a static stiffness very close to the requirement. The method is very flexible, and additional optimization constraints can easily be added. The proposed optimization method has potential of being an important tool in new product development of powertrain mounts or other rubber components. A modified version of the method was also shown to be useful for optimizing hyperelastic material parameters to model a certain rubber compound more accurately...|$|E

The satellite uses a magnetic 3 -axis active {{attitude control system}} (ACS) using magnetic torque rods that interact with the Earth's magnetic field. This thesis accomplishes three goals. The first objective was to verify and to validate the magnetic attitude control system program and model developed by Leonard. The verification and validation process was completed in two steps. The first step accomplished an independent modeling of the Earth's magnetic field using MATLAB. The second step completed a verification via inspection of Leonard's ACS SIMULINK model. The verification confirmed that Leonard's modular sub-components of the disturbance torques, the quaternion vectors, the Euler angles, the spacecraft kinematics and dynamics, and the ACS control laws conformed to current ACS empirical theory.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} performance verification of a magnetically controlled smallsat being built by students and staff at the Naval Postgraduate School. The spacecraft (NPSAT 1) will carry a number of experiments, including two sponsored by the Naval Research Lab and a commercial, off-the-shelf digital camera. Since NPSAT 1 will be a secondary payload, it must be designed for a large mission box at minimum cost. Attitude control pointing requirements are less than 10 ° and an active magnetic control system is planned. NPSAT 1 is manifested on the Department of Defense Space Test Program (STP) MLV- 05, Delta IV mission, due to launch in January 2006. Many spacecraft have employed magnetic sensing and actuation for attitude control. However, in most instances, the systems are designed with long gravity gradient booms for pitch and roll stabilization. The systems usually employ an extended Kalman filter when active damping is required. The NPSAT 1 design employs a magnetic control system based on favorable moments of inertia realized by optimum equipment placement and ballast.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 A post-failure {{investigation}} of a highway embankment constructed over organic and sensitive subsoils was made {{with a series of}} field vane tests. The results indicated that the embankment was quite stable, and, therefore, the reliabilities of both the Φ = 0 slip-circle analysis and the field vane results seemed to be highly questionable. Undisturbed samples taken from an area unaffected by the embankment failure were used to determine the undrained shear strength of these subsoils. The results of both the laboratory vane and unconfined compression tests were appreciably below the results of the field vane tests, but they were not low enough to completely explain the instability of the embankment. It was concluded that a progressive failure of the highly sensitive organic silty clay was partly responsible for the inaccuracy of the Φ = 0 slip-circle stability analysis. However, the major error resulted from the inaccuracies of the field vane results. The effect of the rate of rotation of the laboratory vane upon the undrained shear strength was found to be insignificant. Since the vane basically determines the shear strength developed on the vertical plane, the difference between the shear strength developed on the horizontal plane and vertical plane was studied. Finally, the method of evaluating rod-friction was investigated. It was found that the use of the "dummy" rod for the evaluation of the frictional resistance developed on the field vane's <b>torque</b> <b>rod</b> was inaccurate. This fact was demonstrated by the comparison of original field vane test results with results obtained from a modified slip-joint field vane, capable of directly measuring the rod-friction. It was concluded that a modified slip-joint field vane accurately measured the in situ undrained shear strength. The fact that silty clays found at the highway embankment site were sensitive was not indicated by either the original field vane or the modified slip-joint field vane. The actual sensitivity of these subsoils was determined by both the laboratory vane and the liquidity index of the soils. It was concluded that the in situ sensitivity could not be obtained by the modified slip-joint field vane. The one point that the entire investigation indicated was that before the field vane test results can be intelligently used, additional information about the subsoils is required...|$|E

A good answer to such a growing demand is the development of innovative high-performance architectures compatible {{with a wide range of}} platforms and applications and compliant with ECSS standards. The Ph. D. activities start in this frame, as a cooperation between the University “Federico II” of Naples and the Italian Company Carlo Gavazzi Space S. p. A [...] The research work is focused on the design, integration and validation of new-concept satellite equipments, such as a Li-ion modular battery and a magnetic actuator. Starting from an evaluation of the technologies state-of-the-art and from an assessment of the products currently available on the market, the main potential innovative aspects (able to improve the product characteristics while reducing development costs and times) are pointed out. A critical analysis of the potential innovations is carried out, including the description of the benefits, as well as the strategies to manage the drawbacks. The design of both the modular battery and the magnetic actuator is completely ITAR free and characterized by a simple and reversible integration process. It is also worth mentioning that, for the first time, thanks to an Italian research project, an Italian space company presents itself on the space market as an internationally recognized supplier of batteries and magnetic actuators for space applications. The Li-ion battery is modular in the sense that it can satisfy a large number of energy requests for different satellite configurations by simply adding or removing basic elements named “modules”, i. e. it does not need to be re-designed and re-qualified for each mission. Each battery module, including eight Saft MPS 176065 cells, is completely self-standing from a structural, thermal, and electrical point of view. The first flight opportunity for the modular battery is represented by Lares, i. e. a mission of the Italian Space Agency (ASI). Lares is the payload for the qualification flight of Vega launcher. Lares battery has been manufactured and integrated as a proto-flight model and has been submitted to a successful acceptance campaign, including performance, vibration, and thermal tests. The next flight opportunities for the modular battery are the ASI satellite missions Miosat and Prisma, and the ESA mission named Eseo. A very promising future evolution of the modular battery design is represented by a hybrid Li-ion/supercapacitor battery system able to satisfy the requirements of satellite missions characterized by high peak power requests. The integration of supercapacitors with Li-ion cells can increase battery lifetime and significantly reduce the total mass of the energy storage unit. The integration of supercapacitors in the battery system requests for an accurate evaluation of the use of such technology in the space environment and of the impacts on both Electrical Power Subsystem and Spacecraft System design. A magnetic actuator (or <b>torque</b> <b>rod)</b> for satellite applications consists of a cylindrical ferromagnetic rod winded by a copper wire. The current circulating into the wire determines a magnetic dipole moment interacting with the earth magnetic flux density. This interaction produces a mechanical torque for satellite attitude control. The equipment, designed in the frame of the Ph. D. activities, is characterized by a simple and highly-reversible integration process thanks to an innovative housing and to a non-elastomeric thermal filler. The magnetic core has been selected as an off-the-shelf (non-custom) ferromagnetic alloy, minimizing procurement times and minimum order quantity. The design process, taking into account the demagnetizing field as function of the core shape, follows three main steps: the first is the definition of the core geometry, the second is the selection of the core material, and the third is the sizing of the winding. The actuator design has been preliminary verified by a numerical simulation and successfully validated by a full qualification campaign including performance, vibration, and thermal tests. Part of the Ph.

The on-board ADCS processor runs a real-time operating system that is fully reprogrammable while in orbit. The first two units were launched in November 2016 and both units are currently operating in orbit. We will present the design of the hardware and software systems, pre-launch testing and simulation, and initial on-orbit results...|$|R

An {{analysis}} of the attitude determination and control system required for a small geostationary satellite is performed in this thesis. A three axis quaternion feedback reaction wheel control system is the primary control system used to meet the stringent accuracy requirements. A momentum bias controller is also evaluated to provide redundancy and to extend actuator life. Momentum dumping is preformed by magnetic <b>torque</b> <b>rods</b> using a crossproduct controller. Performance of three axis thruster control is also evaluated. A full state Extended Kalman filter is used to determine attitude and body angular rates during normal operation whereas a Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter is used during attitude manoeuvres. An analytical orbit control study is also performed to calculate the propellant required to perform station-keeping, for a specific sub-satellite location over a ten year period. Finally an investigation on the effects caused by thruster misalignment, on satellite attitude is also performed...|$|R

A flexible material is interposed between the hub and the armature for ensuring certain clearance and filtration of vibrations. A breaker arm rubbing block (4) is disposed between the hub and the armature, and produces a dampening effect by alternation of adherence and sliding for {{the displacement of}} the hub and the armature along a longitudinal direction of a <b>torque</b> reaction <b>rod</b> (1) ...|$|R
40|$|Pulsed plasma {{thrusters}} (PPT's) {{are a new}} {{option for}} attitude control of a small spacecraft and may result in reduced attitude control system (ACS) mass and cost. The primary purpose of an ACS is to orient the spacecraft configuration to the desired accuracy in inertial space. The ACS functions for which the PPT system will be analyzed include disturbance torque compensation and slewing maneuvers such as sun acquisition for which the small impulse bit and high specific impulse of the PPT offers unique advantages. The NASA Lewis Reserach Center (LeRC) currently has a contracted flight PPT system development program in place with Olin Aerospace and a delivery date of October 1997. The PPT system {{in this study are}} based upon the work being done under the NASA LeRC program. Analysis of the use of PPT's for ACS showed that the replacement of the standard momentum wheels and <b>torque</b> <b>rods</b> systems with a PTT system to perform the altitude control maneuvers on a small low Earth orbiting spacecraft reduced the ACS mass by 50 to 75 percent with no increase in required power level over comparable wheel-based systems...|$|R
