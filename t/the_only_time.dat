5|$|The twenty days between Braden's {{perfect game}} and Halladay's was the {{shortest}} span between two perfect games since 1880 {{and there was}} a chance {{that for the first time}} in MLB history there would be three perfect games in such short succession. Had Galarraga's game been correctly called, the four-day span since Halladay's perfect game would have broken that 130-year-old record, and marked <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> that three consecutive no-hitters had been perfect games, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> that three perfect games had occurred in one season (since done in 2012 by Philip Humber, Matt Cain and Félix Hernández), <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> that three perfect games had occurred in a span shorter than a month, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> four perfect games had occurred in a span shorter than a year (as Mark Buehrle of the Chicago White Sox threw a perfect game in July 2009), and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> that four perfect games had occurred within a stretch of five no-hitters.|$|E
