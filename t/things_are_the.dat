25|$|It's true to {{say these}} {{programmes}} {{about climate change}} are different, in that previously I have made programmes about natural history, and now you could say I have an engaged stance.

So I'm glad that the BBC wanted some clear statement of the evidence as to why these two <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> case.|$|E
25|$|The reason Spinoza {{thinks the}} {{parallelism}} follows from this axiom {{is that since}} the idea we have of each thing requires knowledge of its cause, and this cause must be understood under the same attribute. Further, {{there is only one}} substance, so whenever we understand some chain of ideas of things, we understand that the way the ideas are causally related must be the same as the way the things themselves are related, since the ideas and the <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> same modes understood under different attributes.|$|E

25|$|The {{method is}} a {{continuous}} process {{that begins with}} observations about the natural world. People are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear, and they often develop ideas or hypotheses about why <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> way they are. The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways. The strongest tests of hypotheses come from carefully controlled experiments that gather empirical data. Depending on how well additional tests match the predictions, the original hypothesis may require refinement, alteration, expansion or even rejection. If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported, a general theory may be developed.|$|E
500|$|Darren Aronofsky and {{his friend}} Ari Handel created the story for The Fountain, and Aronofsky wrote the screenplay. When Aronofsky saw The Matrix in 1999, he {{considered}} it a film that redefined the science fiction genre. He sought to make a science fiction film that would explore new territory in the genre like The Matrix and its predecessors Star Wars and [...] Aronofsky had in mind a science fiction film that would go beyond the other films whose plots were driven by technology and science. The director said, [...] "We've seen it all. It's not really interesting to audiences anymore. The interesting <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> ideas; the search for God, the search for meaning." ...|$|E

500|$|The Guardian asked six {{well-known}} {{film critics}} {{for their own}} perceptions of the overall meaning in Mulholland Drive. Neil Roberts of The Sun and Tom Charity of Time Out subscribe to the theory that Betty is Diane's projection of a happier life. Roger Ebert and Jonathan Ross seem to accept this interpretation, but both hesitate to overanalyze the film. Ebert states, [...] "There is no explanation. There {{may not even be}} a mystery." [...] Ross observes that there are storylines that go nowhere: [...] "Perhaps these were leftovers from the pilot it was originally intended to be, or perhaps these <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> non-sequiturs and subconscious of dreams." [...] Philip French from The Observer sees it as an allusion to Hollywood tragedy, while Jane Douglas from the BBC rejects the theory of Betty's life as Diane's dream, but also warns against too much analysis.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Radiohead toured {{in support}} of their second album The Bends. Midway through the tour, Brian Eno {{commissioned}} the band to contribute a song to The Help Album, a charity compilation organised by War Child. The Help Album was to be recorded {{over the course of}} a single day, 4 September 1995, and rush-released that week. Radiohead recorded [...] "Lucky" [...] in five hours with engineer Nigel Godrich, who had assisted producer John Leckie with The Bends and produced several Radiohead B-sides. Godrich said of the Help Album session: [...] "Those <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most inspiring, when you do stuff really fast and there's nothing to lose. We left feeling fairly euphoric. So after establishing a bit of a rapport work-wise, I was sort of hoping I would be involved with the next album." [...] To promote The Help Album, [...] "Lucky" [...] featured as the lead track on the Help EP, which charted at number 51 after BBC Radio 1 chose not to play it. This disappointed Radiohead singer Thom Yorke, but he later said [...] "Lucky" [...] shaped the nascent sound and mood of their upcoming record: [...] "'Lucky' was indicative of what we wanted to do. It was like the first mark on the wall." ...|$|E
2500|$|At between {{about the}} ages of four and seven, {{children}} tend to become very curious and ask many questions, beginning the use of primitive reasoning. There is an emergence {{in the interest of}} reasoning and wanting to know why <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> way they are. Piaget called it the [...] "intuitive substage" [...] because children realize they have a vast amount of knowledge, but they are unaware of how they acquired it. Centration, conservation, irreversibility, class inclusion, and transitive inference are all characteristics of preoperative thought.|$|E

In {{an interview with}} The Guardian, Sandison discussed the songwriting process of the tracks, stating: [...] "we often jam something down quickly and you tend to find those <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> ones with a great instant melody." [...] Sandison said that [...] "crafting the tunes into a specific style and time period we want to reference" [...] was a challenging aspect of the process, further noting that [...] "there's a deliberate VHS video-nasty element throughout the record", which was achieved by timing changes in the composition and music to simulate film soundtracks from [...] "around30 years ago." ...|$|E
2500|$|Advertisements for {{the work}} spelled the title [...] "Topsy­turveydom", whereas the license copy of the libretto, filed with the Lord Chamberlain's office, and now held in the British Library, spells it [...] "Topsy­turvydom".

Party politics is lampooned, much as it would be two decades later in Gilbert and Sullivan's Utopia, Limited. As in that work, the king is a [...] "detested" [...] monarch. Gilbert also renews the idea of party politics working in a backwards way in Iolanthe, where the House of Lords is threatened with obsolescence by having its members selected by competitive examination.|$|E
