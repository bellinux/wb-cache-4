500|$|Wodehouse {{believed}} {{that one of}} the factors that made his stories humorous was his view of life, and he stated that [...] "If you take life fairly easily, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> a humorous view of things. It's probably because you were born that way." [...] He carried this view through into his writing, describing the approach as [...] "making the thing a sort of musical comedy without music, and ignoring real life altogether". The literary critic Edward L. Galligan considers Wodehouse's stories to show his mastery in adapting the form of the American musical comedy for his writings. Wodehouse would ensure that his first draft was as carefully and accurately done as possible, correcting and refining the prose as he wrote, and would then make another good copy, before proof reading again and then making a final copy for his publisher.|$|E
2500|$|Two cases arise. [...] The {{first case}} is theoretical: {{when you know}} all the {{coefficients}} [...] <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> certain limits and find the precise radius of convergence. [...] The second case is practical: when you construct a power series solution of a difficult problem you typically will only know {{a finite number of}} terms in a power series, anywhere from a couple of terms to a hundred terms. [...] In this second case, extrapolating a plot estimates the radius of convergence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes ... yes," [...] said Riley, meditatively, [...] "you {{are right}} again. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> the train for New York in the evening, and the steamer for San Francisco next morning?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not yours--it is mine, that <b>you</b> have <b>taken!</b> <b>You</b> put me off my guard, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> it! Yours is elsewhere, and you {{are welcome}} to it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And the {{co-operation}} petered out," [...] {{said the}} reporter making a note. [...] "Always does; and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> it, {{and began to}} make money. Standard history of co-operation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To begin with, {{the thing}} has an airy {{lightness}} {{that ought to}} suit <b>you.</b> <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> care of me {{and we were very}} good friends when I was ill. I'd like to feel I'd given you something that might remind you of this. Besides, you see, I'm going away----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come along, <b>then.</b> <b>You</b> <b>take</b> {{the lift}} down. I'll {{go by the}} stairs. I shan't be late, unless you'd like me to stop and have a shave and my hair trimmed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, no! <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> {{the spring}} water and boil {{it over a}} {{charcoal}} fire, same as the Modoc Indians used to do. You remember all about that, don't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There'll be no {{shooting}} here, Davenport. You try it, and you'll get {{the worst}} of it. Now, <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> back what you said!" [...] and Dick Rover shoved his clenched fist under the other's nose.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and what}} happened?" [...] Philippa demanded. [...] "You were, in a measure, shelved. You {{were put on}} a list and told that you would hear from them--a sort of Micawber-like {{situation}} with which you were perfectly satisfied. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> that moor up in Scotland and disappeared for nearly six months." ...|$|R
6000|$|She hesitated, {{and sank}} {{to her knees}} beside the bed. [...] "Kurt, the day you're able to sit up I'll marry <b>you.</b> <b>Then</b> I'll <b>take</b> <b>you</b> home--to your wheat-hills." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was a local}} {{etiquette}} {{governing the}} game of billiards at the 'Feathers'. You played the marker a hundred up, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> him into the bar-parlour and bought him refreshment. He raised his glass, said, 'To you, sir', and drained it at a gulp. After that you could, if you wished, play another game, or go home, as your fancy dictated.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> me ’ome," [...] ses Bob. [...] "I’m {{not going}} to catch my death o’ cold sitting ’ere. I’m not used to being out of a night like you are. I was brought up respectable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you do it. I don't {{hear the}} dogs and horses yet; you've got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> to the water and wade down to me and get in--that'll throw the dogs off the scent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. You mean {{my father}} and cousin George are misinformed or wrong about Steele? I've feared it this last hour. It was his look. That pierced me. Oh, I'd hate to be unjust. You say I wronged him, Russ? <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> sides with him against my father?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we won't {{lower the}} sail {{until it is}} {{absolutely}} necessary. Come, <b>you</b> <b>take</b> a nap if you can, and I will steer {{as long as the}} sun lasts, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> can <b>take</b> the rudder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{you ask me}} for protection--which {{makes you}} very interesting; and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> won't <b>take</b> it. <b>You</b> {{say you want to}} be squashed--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Decision rose in an icy puff {{from the}} turmoil of insulted shame within her. [...] "Very well, <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> can <b>take</b> your things away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So, that's it, is it?" [...] said St. Clare, carelessly. [...] "Well, here, I'm {{going to}} show this Tom to his mistress, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> him to the kitchen; and mind you don't put on any of your airs to him. He's worth two such puppies as you." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> us to dirty {{illiterate}} Stratford, from fifty to {{eighty years}} after Shakspere's death,--a Civil War and the Reign of the Saints, a Restoration and a Revolution having intervened,--and {{ask us to}} be surprised that no anecdotes of Shakspere's early brilliance, a century before, survived at Stratford.|$|E
6000|$|I scolded. [...] "Why don't {{you speak}} to a man, show yourself? I thought I had a gleam of you in Isabel,--and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> her away. Do you really think I can carry on this game alone, doing your work in {{darkness}} and silence, living in muddled conflict, half living, half dying?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I knew I {{would show}} you soon enough, Mr. Meyer, for <b>then</b> <b>you</b> could <b>take</b> the stuff and our {{partnership}} {{would be at}} an end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] cried Euphemia. [...] "You can {{put him on}} a quilt on the floor, {{until after}} luncheon, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> must <b>take</b> him home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{had died}} in England, {{you would have been}} {{provided}} for by my will. What <b>you</b> would have <b>taken</b> from me <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> may <b>take</b> from me now. Come to the boat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really, mother, the way {{the best}} of women speak of each other is lamentable. You say I should be better married, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> for granted that every marriageable woman in the {{neighbourhood}} is trying to kidnap me. I am sure you did not take my father by force in that way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By my hilt! fair sir, I know not. And yet I call to {{mind that}} ere we fell out this foolish bombardman did say {{something}} of the matter. The fire-dust is within and so also is the ball. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> more dust from this iron box {{and place it in}} the hole at the farther end--so. It is now ready. I have never seen one fired, but I wot that this one could be fired now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do, honey. It's {{one of my}} few--sadly few--useful accomplishments. I've {{disposed}} of several at home. You take the cat {{in the morning and}} give him a good breakfast. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> an old burlap bag--there's one in the back porch--put the cat on it and turn over him a wooden box. Then take a two-ounce bottle of chloroform, uncork it, and slip it under the edge of the box. Put a heavy weight on top of the box and leave it till evening. The cat will be dead, curled up peacefully as if he were asleep. No pain--no struggle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks to God, he is mine," [...] muttered Hugh. [...] "Touch him not, Dick, unless I fall, and <b>then</b> do <b>you</b> <b>take</b> up the quarrel {{till you}} fall." ...|$|R
60|$|Duke. I know my doom <b>then.</b> <b>You</b> have <b>taken</b> {{a popular}} occasion; I am now a ravisher of chastity, {{fit to be}} made {{prisoner}} first, and then deposed.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{the clock}} {{striking}} nine," [...] Cyril said, starting. [...] "It {{is time for}} me to be off. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> will <b>take</b> the books to-day, Captain Dave?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{great number}} of poor people who find {{it so hard to}} live," [...] she answered. [...] "Some of the small houses round here are awful, and Mr. Malcolm--he is the vicar of the church here, and he called yesterday--tells me that they are nothing like so bad as in some other parts of London. And <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> a bus, it is such a short distance--and the shops are full of {{wonderful}} things at such fabulous prices, and the carriages and houses are so lovely, and people seem to be showering money right and left everywhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|The ridiculousness {{of such a}} {{resemblance}} {{struck him}} more keenly than a consciousness of his own ingratitude. He hastened to assure Flip that he was joking. When {{he had made his}} peace they fell into talk again, Lance becoming unselfish enough to inquire into one or two facts concerning her life which did not immediately affect him. Her mother had died on the plains when she was a baby, and her brother had run away from home at twelve. She fully expected to see him again, and thought he might sometime stray into their canyon. [...] "That is why, <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> so much stock in tramps," [...] said Lance. [...] "You expect to recognize HIM?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oars ain't no good here," [...] {{the scout}} said. [...] "You {{will have to}} learn to paddle; but, first of all, you have got to learn to sit still. These here canoes are awkward things for a beginner. Now you hand in your traps, and I will stow them away, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> your place {{in the middle of the}} boat. Here's a paddle for you, and when you begin to feel {{yourself}} comfortable, you can start to try with it, easy and gentle to begin with; but you must lay it in when we get near where we may expect that redskins may be in the woods, for the splash of a paddle might cost us all our scalps." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> must <b>take</b> one at random, Karl. Had one {{been better}} than the other, I should have left it behind. As it is, <b>take</b> {{whichever}} <b>you</b> choose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is all right," [...] he said cheerfully. [...] "You see, I {{was saving}} {{my own life}} as well as yours; and it is to you, Dinah," [...] he said, turning and shaking her hand, [...] "it is to you that we really all owe our lives. First you warned us in time, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> us to a place of safety, and have since got us food and news, and risked your own life in doing so.|$|R
