5|$|How life {{originated}} from inorganic matter remains an unresolved problem in biology. One prominent {{hypothesis is that}} life {{first appeared in the}} form of short self-replicating RNA polymers. On this view, life may have come into existence when RNA chains first experienced the basic conditions, as conceived by Charles Darwin, for natural selection to operate. These conditions are: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources. The fitness of an early RNA replicator would likely have been a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (i.e., determined by the nucleotide sequence) and the availability of resources. The three primary adaptive capacities could logically have been: (1) <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> to replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type), (2) <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> to avoid decay, and (3) <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> to acquire and process resources. These capacities would have been determined initially by the folded configurations (including those configurations with ribozyme activity) of the RNA replicators that, in turn, would have been encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences.|$|E

30|$|In this article, the {{statistical}} {{properties of the}} instantaneous capacityc of N*Nakagami-m channels are analyzed.

Both <b>the</b> mean channel <b>capacity</b> and outage capacity have widely been used in the literature due to their importance for the system design. <b>The</b> mean channel <b>capacity</b> is <b>the</b> ensemble average of the information rate over all realizations of <b>the</b> channel <b>capacity</b> [28]. <b>The</b> outage <b>capacity</b> is defined as the maximum information rate that can be transmitted over a channel with an outage probability corresponding to the probability that the transmission cannot be decoded with an arbitrarily small error probability [29]. In general, <b>the</b> mean channel <b>capacity</b> is less complicated to study analytically than <b>the</b> outage <b>capacity</b> [30]. Although <b>the</b> mean channel <b>capacity</b> and outage capacity are important quantities that describe the channel, they do not give any insight into the dynamic behavior of <b>the</b> channel <b>capacity.</b> For example, <b>the</b> outage <b>capacity</b> does not provide any information regarding the spread of the outage intervals or the rate of occurrence of these outage durations in the time domain. In [23], it has been demonstrated that the temporal behavior of <b>the</b> channel <b>capacity</b> is very useful for the improvement of the overall network performance.|$|R
