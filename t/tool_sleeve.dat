40|$|A {{friction}} stir weld <b>tool</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{is supported}} by an underlying support pin. The pin material is preferably selected for toughness and fracture characteristics. The pin sleeve preferably has a geometry which employs {{the use of an}} interrupted thread, a plurality of flutes and/or eccentric path to provide greater flow through. Paddles have been found to assist in imparting friction and directing plastic metal during the welding process...|$|E

40|$|<b>Tool</b> removes <b>sleeve</b> {{remnants}} without distorting or damaging tubes, unlike pliers {{and other}} conventional handtools. Tubes can be reused, saving time, labor, and material in many applications. Sleeve-removal fixture consists of pressure screw, swing arm, locking screws, and base. It removes sleeve remnant from tubing after welded joint has been sawed through...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} MP 18.1 {{was designed}} to use the snail drum magazine of the Luger Artillery model pistol. This rotary design type of magazine holds 32 rounds of 9 mm Parabellum, the user having to load the magazine with a proprietary loading <b>tool.</b> A special <b>sleeve</b> was required when the snail drum was used on the MP18 to stop the snail drum from being inserted too far in the magazine well.|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{assemblage}} of Neolithic antler <b>tools</b> – <b>sleeves</b> originated from the lake-dwelling sites of Switzerland, which are stored at National Museum of Tatarstan Republic. The morphological and technological analyses of 94 connecting devices between the wooden haft and stone axe or adze (sleeves) {{have been carried}} out by the authors. The typology scheme has been made. Four unequal groups were singled out: 1) elementary device with one mounting hole for the stone tool of adze or chisel function (1 instance); 2) a pick-axe shaped device with hafting hole (1); 3) sleeve of cylindrical shape with two holes (4 instances); 4) sleeve with one mounting hole (88). The last one consists of 4 types depending on {{the presence or absence of}} clear-cut hafting part and functional or nonfunctional ledge as well as remnant of the burr. The authors consider some aspects of use-wear and technology of the production of Neolithic antler sleeves investigated, such as string-saw technique, according to the results of multidiscipline and experimental studies held by European researchers (Jorg Schibler et al. ...|$|R
40|$|Nicopress cable sleeves {{are one of}} the {{fundamental}} tools of our trade and a critical element of almost every system we install. It is important that installers know how to use these tools and gauges properly, and equally important that we understand the swaging process and how to use the gauges required to inspect their work. The following is a brief description of how to use the Nicopress documentation and gauges to inspect newly installed swages in the field. Important Note: This is designed to be a summary and guide for use of the manufacturer’s instructions. For specific information regarding this topic {{it is important that the}} reader review the Nicopress documents. The references for this paper are listed on the last page. To be installed correctly, a Nicopress swage must include the following: 1. The correct sleeve for the cable and application. 2. The correct <b>tool</b> for the <b>sleeve.</b> 3. The correct groove in the tool. 4. The correct number of presses for the tool/groove combination. 5. The correct gauge for the tool 6. The correct arrangement of the fittings and proper inspection after crimping...|$|R
