5|$|The {{representation}} of gangsters {{in the literature}} (Drum magazine) went through very different stages during the 1950s and early 1960s. The first representation is characterized by consistent condemnations of crime as an urban phenomenon that threatens the rural identity of tribal blacks. The second is almost a complete <b>turn-around</b> from the first, as gangsters are portrayed as urban survivors {{who are able to}} achieve a standard of living normally denied to blacks. The final period is an extended period of nostalgia for the shebeen culture that all but disappeared with the destruction of Sophiatown.|$|E
5|$|A {{third track}} along {{much of the}} line north of 96th Street {{has been used in}} the past for peak {{direction}} express service, at least between 96th Street and 137th Street. This center track is currently used only during construction reroutes. There is another unused third track between Dyckman Street and Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street. Three yards have connections to the line. The 240th Street Yard is located between Van Cortlandt Park-242nd Street and 238th Street. This yard holds 21 layup tracks and can hold the entire rolling stock for the 1. The next yard, 207th Street Yard holds a few trains that are used during rush hours and cleans and overhauls some of the line's fleet. Finally, the 137th Street Yard has six tracks, which hold rush hour <b>turn-around</b> trains.|$|E

5|$|IndiGo {{became one}} of the fastest growing low cost {{carriers}} in the world and was the largest profitable airline in India. The success of IndiGo has been attributed to its unique business model which reduces costs. The airline operates a single type of aircraft (Airbus A320) in similar seating configuration which simplifies crew training and maintenance. The airline strikes bulk deals with Airbus reducing unit costs. The airline targets a quick <b>turn-around</b> time of 20 minutes to get the aircraft ready for the next flight, ensuring planes fly about 12 hours every day. With this it has created an Indian record of more than 900 flights a day. Employees share multiple roles with a check-in staff doubling as a baggage handler.|$|E
5|$|When Holmenkolbanen, the {{operator}} of the Holmenkoll Line, was merged into Oslo Sporveier in 1975, plans {{were put in}} place to replace the old teak cars with faster units that could operate from Nationaltheatret to Frognerseteren in 25 minutes—allowing a <b>turn-around</b> time of one hour. At the time there had been two separate pools of trains for the eastern and western networks. On the eastern metro, the T1000 units were in use, while the western network was using older material. During the 1980s, some T1000 stock had been rebuilt with pantograph, and taken into use on the western network.|$|E
5|$|Between 1871 and 1874, {{while he}} lectured at the Conservatory, Rimsky-Korsakov {{thoroughly}} grounded himself in Western compositional techniques, {{and came to}} believe in the value of academic training for success as a composer. Once Rimsky-Korsakov had made this <b>turn-around,</b> Tchaikovsky considered him an esteemed colleague, and, if not the best of friends, was at least on friendly terms with him. When the other members of The Five became hostile toward Rimsky-Korsakov for his change of attitude, Tchaikovsky continued to support Rimsky-Korsakov morally, telling him that he fully applauded what Rimsky-Korsakov was doing, and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. Beginning in 1876, Tchaikovsky was a regular visitor to the Rimsky-Korsakov home during his trips to Saint Petersburg. At one point, Tchaikovsky offered to have Rimsky-Korsakov appointed to the directorship of the Moscow Conservatory, but he refused.|$|E
50|$|Maryland {{was led by}} third-year {{head coach}} Jim Tatum, who had {{engineered}} one season <b>turn-arounds</b> at Maryland and previously Oklahoma. Missouri was coached by his former boss, Don Faurot, under whom Tatum had previous been an assistant coach for the U.S. Navy's Iowa Pre-Flight team. This game {{was the first in}} a six-game series between the former colleagues and would last for the remainder of Tatum's tenure at Maryland.|$|R
50|$|The Dual Contracts {{expansion}} projects radically changed {{operations at}} Marcy Avenue. A third track was added, allowing trains to run express, although the track remains as a stub-end at Marcy Avenue for storage and <b>turn-arounds.</b> The Contracts also {{provided for the}} merger of the Jamaica Line from Broadway Junction to 168th Street with the Broadway Elevated, in turn making the Broadway Elevated part of the Jamaica Line and giving trains three eastern terminals.|$|R

As of May 2011, Tullman has started 12 companies, including Tribeca Flashpoint Media Arts Academy, CCC Information Services, Tunes.com, the Rolling Stone Network, Imagination Pilots, Experiencia, and others. Tullman has also been tapped for senior executive positions at established institutions such as Coin Inc., Worldwide Xceed and Kendall College, where his expertise in <b>turn-arounds</b> saved the school from going into bankruptcy in 2003.|$|R
5|$|The A-10 was envisioned to {{fly from}} forward air bases and semi-prepared runways with {{high risk of}} foreign object damage to the engines. The unusual {{location}} of the General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofan engines decreases ingestion risk, and allows the engines to run while the aircraft is serviced and rearmed by ground crews, reducing <b>turn-around</b> time. The wings are also mounted closer to the ground, simplifying servicing and rearming operations. The heavy engines require strong supports: four bolts connect the engine pylons to the airframe. The engines' high 6:1 bypass ratio contributes to a relatively small infrared signature, and their position directs exhaust over the tailplanes further shielding it from detection by infrared homing surface-to-air missiles. The engines and exhausts are angled upward by nine degrees to cancel out the nose-down pitching moment that would otherwise generate from being mounted above the aircraft's center of gravity and avoids the need to trim the control surfaces to prevent pitching.|$|E

50|$|Dauling Dragon (Chinese: 木翼双龙) is {{a wooden}} roller coaster located at Happy Valley in Wuhan, Hubei, China. It is China's third wooden roller coaster and its first racing roller coaster. Although {{billed as a}} racing coaster, it {{contains}} elements that make it similar to dueling coasters, such as racing portions, head-on collision <b>turn-arounds,</b> and sections where the tracks weave around each other. This is much like Lightning Racer at Hersheypark (however, Lightning Racer was manufactured by Great Coasters International).|$|R
50|$|Landing is {{just the}} start of the {{problems}} for NASA, who now {{have to deal with the}} immense technological challenge of getting the shuttle back home. Problems include lack of documents for the astronauts and shuttle, bringing in the crane that's used to lift the shuttle onto the specially modified 747 that carries it, widening the runway to accommodate the 747, building <b>turn-arounds</b> on the runway so that it can turn and take off again, bringing in fuel for the plane and many, many other problems.|$|R
5000|$|The LPC bus derives its {{electrical}} conventions {{from those}} of conventional PCI. In particular, it shares the restriction that two idle cycles are required to [...] "turn around" [...] any bus signal so that a different device is [...] "speaking". In the first, the bus is actively driven high. In the second, the bus is undriven and held high by the pull-up resistors. A new device may begin sending data over the bus on the third cycle. LPC operations spend a large fraction of their time performing such <b>turn-arounds.</b>|$|R

50|$|For {{branch line}} operations, the 2-6-0 Class 24 {{passenger}} train locomotive {{was developed in}} 1926 with an axle load of 15 tons and 920 PS. Nicknamed Steppenpferd (prairie horse), it was aimed at duties in East Prussia. As a tender locomotive it was intended for long journeys with {{a top speed of}} 90 km/h as well as for light fast trains (Eilzüge). From this locomotive a tank engine variant, the 2-6-2 Class 64, was developed for shuttle services on shorter routes. The 4-6-4 Class 62 locomotive was built for short main lines with numerous <b>turn-arounds</b> (termini). It had a top speed of 100 km/h.|$|R

50|$|The breed {{characteristics}} of the Briard, are of a medium-sized, rugged, agile dog, having harsh coat and double dewclaws mounted low on each rear leg, resembling additional toes. Each double dew claw should have bone substance and nail, giving {{the appearance of a}} wider rear foot. Bred for centuries to herd, the additional digits on each rear foot give the Briard the ability of pivoting on one foot for quick turns and complete <b>turn-arounds,</b> which are necessary when herding and guarding their flocks. Throughout history, the Briard has retained an appropriate balance of size and build that is required for both herding and protection of their flocks. They are not too large to tire during herding yet large enough to fend off predators such as fox and wolves.|$|R

One of the centres of this essay is interpretation of Titian's painting Apollo and Marsyas, painting, which sophisticatedly problematizes viewing the painting as pure illusion or manifestation of ideas in matter. The second milestone are works of american minimalism, which are places of radiating aura, but aura in stae of her own decay. We tried to show, that if the original meaning of aura was connected to cultic works of art and their presented inaccessibility, in case of american minimalists it is surviving as a experience of <b>turn-arounded</b> vertigo...|$|R
