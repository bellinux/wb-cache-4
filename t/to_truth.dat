5|$|Original Stories from Real Life; with Conversations Calculated to Regulate the Affections, and Form the Mind <b>to</b> <b>Truth</b> and Goodness is {{the only}} {{complete}} work of children's literature by the 18th-century English feminist author Mary Wollstonecraft. Original Stories begins with a frame story that sketches out the education of two young girls by their maternal teacher Mrs. Mason, followed {{by a series of}} didactic tales. The book was first published by Joseph Johnson in 1788; a second, illustrated edition, with engravings by William Blake, was released in 1791 and remained in print for around a quarter of a century.|$|E
5|$|Wittgenstein {{believed}} {{that religion is}} significant because it offers a particular way of life, rather than confirming the existence of God. He therefore {{believed that}} religious language is confessional– a confession of what someone feels and believes– rather than consisting of claims <b>to</b> <b>truth.</b> Wittgenstein believed that religious language is different from language used to describe physical objects because it occupies a different language game.|$|E

5|$|Peter Donovan criticises the language-games {{approach}} {{for failing to}} recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many religious people make claims <b>to</b> <b>truth.</b> He notes that many religious believers not only believe their religion to be meaningful and true in its own context, but claim that it is true against all other possible beliefs; if the language games analogy is accepted, such a comparison between beliefs is impossible. Donovan proposes that debates between different religions, and the apologetics of some, demonstrates that they {{interact with each other}} and the wider world and so cannot be treated as isolated language games.|$|E
5|$|That praises {{are without}} reason lavished on the dead, {{and that the}} honours due only to {{excellence}} are paid to antiquity, is a complaint likely to be always continued by those, who, being able to add nothing <b>to</b> <b>truth,</b> hope for eminence from the heresies of paradox; or those, who, being forced by disappointment upon consolatory expedients, are willing to hope from posterity what the present age refuses, and flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy, will be at last bestowed by time. Antiquity, like every other quality that attracts the notice of mankind, has undoubtedly votaries that reverence it, not from reason, but from prejudice. Some seem to admire indiscriminately whatever has been long preserved, without considering that time has sometimes co-operated with chance; all perhaps {{are more willing to}} honour past than present excellence; and the mind contemplates genius through the shades of age, as the eye surveys the sun through artificial opacity. The great contention of criticism is to find the faults of the moderns, and the beauties of the ancients. While an authour is yet living we estimate his powers by his worst performance, and when he is dead we rate them by his best.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. I {{criticize the}} {{following}} three arguments for moral objectivism. 1. Since we assess moral statements, we can arrive at some moral truths (Thomson, 2006). 2. One culture can be closer <b>to</b> <b>truths</b> than another in moral matters because the for-mer can be closer <b>to</b> <b>truths</b> than the latter in scientific matters (Pojman, 2008). 3. A moral judgment is shown to be true when it is backed up by reason (Rachels and Rachels, 2010). Finally, I construct a dilemma against the view that there are moral truths and we can move toward them...|$|R

25|$|Heideggerians {{regarded}} Søren Kierkegaard as, by far, {{the greatest}} philosophical contributor to Heidegger's own existentialist concepts.

25|$|Seeking {{refuge from}} the waswās means that the seeker after refuge himself seeks God's refuge from its evil, i.e. from the evil lest it should whisper some evil {{suggestion}} into his own heart. The second meaning is that the caller <b>to</b> <b>truth</b> seeks God's {{refuge from the}} evil {{of the one who}} whispers evil suggestions into the hearts of the people against himself. It is not in his own power to approach all the people in whose hearts evil suggestions are being whispered against himself individually and remove the misunderstandings of every person. It is also not right and proper for him that he should give up his mission of inviting others to God and should devote all his tune and energy to removing the misunderstanding created by the whisperer and to answering their accusations. It is also below his dignity that he should stoop to the level of his opponents. Therefore, God has instructed the caller <b>to</b> <b>truth</b> to seek only His refuge from the evil of the wicked people, and then to attend single-mindedly to his work of invitation and mission. For it is not for him to deal with them but for God, who is Sustainer of men, King of men, God of men.|$|E
25|$|The novels show several {{competing}} religions, {{in imitation}} of religion's centrality to the Middle Ages, and to suit the author's perception {{of himself as a}} lapsed Catholic with atheist or agnostic habits. To evade the difficulty of inventing religions, George R. R. Martin based the series' major religions on real religious systems. The fictional history of Westeros shows how each religion evolved. Each of the religions reflects its culture's temperament. When questioned, Martin regards any (real or fictional) religion's claim <b>to</b> <b>truth</b> with suspicion, and is not satisfied by the idea that a benevolent God allows for a world full of suffering.|$|E
25|$|The {{philosophical}} {{roots of}} the relational frame theory (RFT) account of ToM arise from contextual psychology and refer {{to the study of}} organisms (both human and non-human) interacting in and with a historical and current situational context. It is an approach based on contextualism, a philosophy in which any event is interpreted as an ongoing act inseparable from its current and historical context and in which a radically functional approach <b>to</b> <b>truth</b> and meaning is adopted. As a variant of contextualism, RFT focuses on the construction of practical, scientific knowledge. This scientific form of contextual psychology is virtually synonymous with the philosophy of operant psychology.|$|E
