5|$|Daily fantasy {{sports have}} faced notable legal challenges, {{including}} disputes over whether DFS constitutes gambling. Politicians {{and other critics}} have argued that due to their format, players are essentially making proposition wagers on the varying performance of individual athletes in specific games, and not managing <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> selections on a week-to-week basis. Proponents have defended DFS as being a game of skill, as the required familiarity with the players and teams, as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players. Local laws have varying definitions of gambling games, such as whether a game's elements of chance are predominant over those or skill, or how much control the player has over {{the outcome of the}} game.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} {{effect of the}} war was a psychological one. The heavy losses deeply affected many directly, and war memorials were built all over the country as people sought to remember those that had been killed. However, despite the size of Australia's contribution to the fighting, there were many Australians who had had no actual experience of it. Realising this, and having witnessed the impact of the war first hand, Charles Bean, who was instrumental in editing and writing the official history of Australia's involvement in the war, advocated the need for a national memorial {{and was one of the}} main architects in establishing the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. The experience of the war also perpetuated many notions about the Australian character and national identity that endure to this day. For many Australians <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> soldiers—particularly during the failed Gallipoli campaign—served to highlight the nation's emergence as a member of the international community, while bringing to the fore a belief in Australians' natural ability as soldiers. The attitudes of many Australians towards war itself were also greatly affected. There was a widespread revulsion at the large-scale destruction and loss of life that had occurred and a desire that it should never occur again. In many regards this led to a general complacency towards defence and military matters after the war and arguably led to the nation's lack of preparedness for the next major conflict, while it may still be evident in Australian strategic behaviour to this day.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the value that}} aldermen in Dutch municipalities, who are elected politicians, attach to quantitative output information. The paper especially focuses {{on the way in}} which aldermen evaluate <b>the</b> <b>performances</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> professional top managers. In the paper the Hopwood evaluation styles, which originally refer to the private sector, are further developed for the public sector. Exploratory field research was conducted in the municipalities of Groningen, Leeuwarden and The Hague. The research shows that the aldermen paid much attention to a manager's activities and the organization's operations and relatively little to outputs. Aldermen did not use an 'output-constrained' or an 'outcome-conscious' evaluation style. Rather, most of the politicians evaluated <b>the</b> <b>performances</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> top managers in a style that is here called an 'operations-conscious style'. This evaluation style focuses on the activities of managers and the processes <b>of</b> <b>their</b> organization. Quantitative output information plays some part in this evaluation style, but the main question is whether a manager acts as a good 'facilitator', i. e. ensures that his organization is functioning well. Besides, important criteria are the way in which a manager deals with short-term problems and with the politicians' opinions and personal wishes. ...|$|R
