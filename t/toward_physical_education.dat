40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of course frequency on attitudes of college students <b>toward</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education.</b> A secondary purpose was to establish the effects of fitness level on attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education.</b> Finally, the interaction of course frequency and fitness level on attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> was to be identified. Students enrolled for PEG 124 (n = 97) served as subjects for this study. There were 68 male subjects and 29 female subjects. The three times a week course frequency had 42 subjects, whereas the two times a week course frequency had 55 subjects. Subjects completed an adaptation of Adam’s (162) survey on attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> the first week of class and the last week of class. To estimate each subjects fitness level, the Rockport Institute’s One-Mile Walk Test was administered. A 2 x 3 x 2 ANOVA was used to analyze the data. Results indicated that course frequency, as well as fitness level, had no significant effect on attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education.</b> Moreover, the interaction between course frequency and fitness level was non-existent. Further analysis did reveal that there was a significant change in attitudes from the pre-test attitude survey to the post-test attitude survey for the entire sample. However, this change could not be attributed to any of the variables that were analyzed in this study. There also was no statistically significant difference in attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> between males and females. School of Physical EducationThesis (M. S. ...|$|E

This study involved twenty 9 th and 10 th grade students from a charter high school in an off campus physical education program. Attitudes were determined using a survey and focus group interviews. Fitness testing was used to analyze student performance. One student was unable to participant in fitness testing due to an injury. One main research question and five sub-questions guided this study. Questions explored student attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education,</b> choice, fitness testing and meaning of physical education. All students completed a validated 20 -item attitude survey. Participants completed fitness testing in five areas. Four males and four females randomly selected participated in focus group interviews after completing the survey. Each interview was audio recorded and transcribed for analysis. An inductive analysis approach was used to identify themes; Four themes emerged: 1) ???We don???t have to do a Certain Thing!??? 2) To Like or Not to Like 3) Boring, Old Fitness Testing and 4) Overwhelmed by Multiple Teachers. The results showed that the students in this study had a positive attitude <b>toward</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education.</b> Students found choice in physical education to be positive experience. Students expressed dissatisfaction with rule alterations in sports and games, although they understood the purpose. Although participants had high scores on fitness testing, they did not enjoy it. Participants found teachers to be enthusiastic; however, the multiple undergraduate teachers were less enjoyable for students.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} secondary students 2 ̆ 7 attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> and to identify the variables that contribute to the formation of those attitudes. In addition, the link between the attitudes that students hold <b>toward</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> and their behavior in physical education class was investigated. A survey given to 150 students was used as a screening device to select thirty-six participants. Data were collected by: (a) conducting two group interviews with each of the student participants, (b) conducting stimulated recall sessions and individual interviews, (c) observing classes, (d) videotaping classes, and (e) interviewing each of the four teachers who were conducting the observed classes. The data were coded and analyzed revealing differences and similarities between students who held varying attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education.</b> ^ Aspects of cultural, societal, and school contexts were found to be the major influences of student attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education.</b> The major influences within the cultural context were gender, an idolization of elite sport persons and a compartmentalization of the body and mind. Within the societal context, influential factors were family, mass media, the participants 2 ̆ 7 sporting experience and skill level, peers, previous physical education experiences, and perceptions of fitness. These factors influenced the self concept and self esteem of the students. The most influential factor within the school context was the teacher. ^ Students often expected (a) physical education to be fun, (b) physical education class to have few goals or challenges, (c) learning not to take place in physical education, and (d) physical education to be sport. Those expectations lead many students to believe that physical education was not a 2 ̆ 2 real 2 ̆ 2 subject. This belief, together with the influential factors within the three contexts, affected student attitude <b>toward</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education.</b> ^ The findings suggested that student behavior often does indicate attitude.

In 2013, a cross-sectional study of 1793 students aged 12 to 15 years was conducted across eight middle schools in Beijing, China. Four schools were selected from an urban district and another four schools were from a suburban district. Physical activity and sedentary behavior data were collected using the commonly used school-based Chinese version of the China Health and Nutrition Survey. The mean age of sampled students was 13. 3 ± 1. 0 years; 51. 5 % were boys. Approximately 76. 6 % of students reported having three 45 -minute physical education classes every week. A total of 35. 6 % students spent ≥ 1 h/day performing moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during school, and 34. 9 % spent ≥ 1 h/day in MVPA outside school time. Approximately half (49. 7 %) of the students engaged in reading, writing, or drawing for ≥ 2 h/day, and 42. 9 % reported screen time for ≥ 2 h/day. Although boys spent more time engaged in physical activity than girls did, they also spent more time exhibiting sedentary behavior. Each 10 -unit increase in attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> was associated with an increased odds of 1. 15 (95 %CI: 1. 09 - 1. 20) for spending more than 1 h/day on MVPA.

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the predictors of attitude of the students as future PE teachers towards inclusion in PE. In this study, the predictors in the field of personality, professional competences for working with children with disabilities and certain personal characteristics (gender) were included. The sample included 221 students of the final year of studies at the Faculty of Sport and <b>Physical</b> <b>Education</b> in Belgrade, Niš and Novi Sad. In order to measure the {{attitude towards}} inclusion in PE, the instrument of Attitude <b>Toward</b> Inclusive <b>Physical</b> <b>Education</b> was used. In the field of personality, a trait of openness to experience was examined, which was measured using the HEXACO PI-R instrument. An additional questionnaire was also designed by which the students were asked to indicate their gender and professional competences for working with children with disabilities: their average mark during the studies, subjective assessment of the level of knowledge and skills required for working with children with disabilities acquired in the course of their studies (self-assessment of professional competence) and experience in working with children with disabilities during their professional practice. The results of multiple regression analysis showed that openness to experience, self-assessment of professional competence and gender were significant predictors. The results indicate that, during the training for teaching profession, it is necessary to develop students' specific competences required for the work in inclusive education as well as to create the teaching atmosphere which will enhance inquisitiveness and creativity as significant determinants of the trait of openness to experience...|$|R
