5|$|Dave Pear, the Buccaneers' first Pro Bowl {{selection}} and most popular player, {{was traded to}} the Oakland Raiders for two draft picks. This was partly to get extra help in what was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> offensive draft, but also because Pear had requested that he be traded if his contract could not be renegotiated. Dave Green, the punter and kicker through the first three seasons, had to be replaced when he tore his achilles tendon stepping over a tackling dummy in training camp.|$|E
5|$|The 56th Academy Award {{nominations}} {{were announced}} about ten months after Tender Mercies was released. Little {{had been done}} to promote its candidacy: only four Oscar campaign advertisements were purchased; all of them appeared in the trade journal Variety, and Duvall had declined to campaign for himself or the film. Beresford and studio executives were surprised when the film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Harper was believed by some <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> contender for either Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress, but ultimately she was nominated in neither category.|$|E

5|$|Gilligan {{played in}} the next Test match, without much success, and for the Gentlemen at Lord's. The effects of the injury then forced him {{to rest in the}} {{following}} weeks and he missed the fourth Test. When he returned for the final Test, he did not take any wickets and finished the Test series with 17 wickets at an average of 18.94, placing him second in the England bowling averages behind Tate. He batted just three times in the series, scoring 77 runs at 25.66. England won the series 3–0, and although South Africa had not proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> team, several England players—including Gilligan—had impressed commentators. Gilligan continued to take wickets in the latter stages of the season, but was less successful than before his injury. At the end of the season, he had 103 wickets at 19.36 and 864 runs at 21.07.|$|E
5|$|In late August, at the 2006 U.S. National Championships, Liukin {{successfully}} defended her all-around, {{beam and}} bars titles, becoming a two-time senior national champion. She {{was named to}} the U.S. team for the 2006 World Gymnastics Championships in Aarhus, Denmark, and was expected by many <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> contender for the all-around title. However, because of an ankle injury sustained in training before the competition began, she was only able to compete on one event, the uneven bars. In spite of her injury, in the qualification round, Liukin's bars set earned a 16.2, the highest score of any competitor on any apparatus in the meet. Her bars routine in team finals scored a 15.7 and helped the U.S. team win the silver medal. Liukin also qualified for the event finals on bars, where she took a small step on her dismount and finished with a 16.05, earning a silver medal behind Britain's Beth Tweddle.|$|E

5|$|Marx {{continued}} to write articles for the New York Daily Tribune {{as long as}} he was sure that the Tribune's editorial policy was still progressive. However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy. No longer was the Tribune <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> abolitionist paper dedicated to a complete Union victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the Confederacy in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the Tribune.|$|E
5|$|Rivera is {{regarded}} within baseball {{as one of}} the most dominant relievers in major league history. Pitching with a longevity and consistency uncommon to the closer role, he saved at least 25games in 15consecutive seasons and posted an ERA under 2.00 in 11seasons, both of which are records. His career 2.21ERA and 1.00WHIP are the lowest in the live-ball era among qualified pitchers. Fellow players credit him with popularizing the cut fastball across the major leagues. Along with his signature pitch, Rivera was known for his precise control, smooth pitching motion, and for his composure and reserved demeanor on the field. In 2013, the Yankees retired his uniform number 42; he was the last major league player to wear the number full-time, following its league-wide retirement in honor of Jackie Robinson. Rivera has been involved in philanthropic causes and the Christian community through the Mariano Rivera Foundation. He is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> candidate for the Baseball Hall of Fame once he is eligible.|$|E
5|$|The local {{rivalry between}} Atlético and Cruzeiro, {{known as the}} Clássico Mineiro ("Mineiro Derby"), exists since Cruzeiro's {{foundation}} (as Sociedade Esportiva Palestra Itália) in 1921. It strengthened in the 1940s, and became the biggest derby in Minas Gerais in the 1960s. Atlético dominated the rivalry from its early days until the 1950s, but Cruzeiro rose in the 1960s <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> challenger, and the 1970s had divided honours. The 1980s were dominated by Atlético, while the 1990s and 2000s were favourable to Cruzeiro. The 2010s have the rivals competing at an even level. The clubs dissent over the number of matches and head-to-head record of the Clássico Mineiro, but both team's statistics show Atlético with most wins in the encounter. The only national final between the two clubs happened in the 2014 Copa do Brasil, when Atlético triumphed in a final match played at the Mineirão. The Clássicos most extreme result was a 9–2 win by Atlético, in the 1927 Campeonato Mineiro.|$|E

He quickly referred himself to the Commissioner, has already repaid allowances from July 2006 in full, and has cooperated fully with the Commissioner's investigation". The Committee's conclusion <b>was</b> however that <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> sanction than repayment was indeed needed. This led to the vote temporarily excluding Laws from the House of Commons.|$|R
50|$|Also in 2003, Wyong {{entered the}} Newcastle Rugby League Competition which <b>was</b> {{perceived}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> league.

Wyong were runner's up in the Newcastle Rugby League in 2007 and First Grade Premiers in 2009. This was Wyong's third stint in Newcastle rugby league competitions, having previously competed in Second Grade in 1912, 1913 and 1914; in Third Grade in 1945 and in a Southern Newcastle competition in 1946.|$|R
5|$|While {{studying}} for his O-levels {{he began to}} have difficulties reading the blackboard and was initially devastated when told he would need glasses. At first, he played poorly at school, encumbered by the fragile spectacles. However, matters improved when a more robust pair, similar to those glasses worn by cricketer Roy Marshall, were fashioned {{for him at the}} behest of his maternal uncle, Albert Speight. Albert would go on <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> influence on Boycott's early cricketing game while playing for Brierley Juniors Football Club. In 1958, Boycott left school with seven O-level passes and the school's Individual Cricket Cup. That summer he played for the Leeds United under-18 football team alongside Billy Bremner and attracted the attention of Leeds United scouts. During the winter he continued to play nets with uncle Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 U.S. Senate {{election}} in Massachusetts, Kennedy faced his first serious challenger, the young, telegenic, and very well-funded Mitt Romney. Romney ran {{as a successful}} entrepreneur and Washington outsider with a strong family image and moderate stands on social issues, while Kennedy was saddled not only with his recent past but the 25th anniversary of Chappaquiddick and his first wife Joan seeking a renegotiated divorce settlement. By mid-September 1994, polls showed the race to be even. Kennedy's campaign ran short on money, and belying his image as endlessly wealthy, {{he was forced to}} take out a second mortgage on his Virginia home. Kennedy responded with a series of attack ads, which focused both on Romney's shifting political views and on the treatment of workers at a paper products plant owned by Romney's Bain Capital. Kennedy's new wife Vicki proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> asset in campaigning. Kennedy and Romney held a widely watched late October debate without a clear winner, but by then Kennedy had pulled ahead in polls and stayed ahead afterward. In the November election, despite a very bad outcome for the Democratic Party nationally, Kennedy won re-election by a 58percent to 41percent margin, the closest re-election race of his career.|$|E
