25|$|The Scot James Tassie (1735–1799), and {{his nephew}} William (1777–1860) {{developed}} methods for taking hard impressions from old gems, {{and also for}} casting new designs from carved wax in enamel, enabling a huge production of what are really imitation engraved gems. The fullest catalogue of his impressions ("Tassie gems") was published in 1791, with 15,800 items. There are complete sets of the impressions in the Hermitage, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, and in Edinburgh. Other types of imitation became fashionable for ladies' brooches, such as ceramic cameos by Josiah Wedgwood in jasperware. The engraved gem fell permanently out of fashion from about the 1860s, perhaps partly as a growing realization {{of the number of}} gems that were not what they seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>scared</b> collectors. Among the last practitioners was James Robertson, who sensibly moved into the new art of photography. Perhaps the best known gem engraver of the 20th century, working in a contemporary idiom, is the British artist Ronald Pennell, whose work is held in the British Crafts Council Collection among many others.|$|E

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1 star out of 4, writing in his review, [...] "I stared at A Nightmare on Elm Street with weary resignation. The movie consists of a series of teenagers who are introduced, haunted by nightmares and then slashed to death by Freddy. So what?

500|$|Having left Cold Feet, Ripley {{began to}} take on more leading roles; her first role was as {{housewife}} Deanna in the BBC thriller Green-Eyed Monster, which was broadcast in September 2001. She researched her character, a murderer, by visiting a coroner. Guardian critic Gareth McLean wrote of her performance, [...] "Ripley {{did a good job}} of exorcising the ghost of Jenny Gifford [...] by coolly cranking up the insane desperation and needy malevolence to an impressive degree." [...] In 2002, she played domestic abuse victim Donna Massey in Danny Brocklehurst's The Stretford Wives. Ripley was initially not eager to play another character from around Manchester so soon after leaving Cold Feet, but she changed her mind after reading the script. She did not research spousal abuse to play her character, a woman struggling to bring up her two children in a run-down house while her husband is imprisoned, because she did not find it difficult to [...] "work out what it's like <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>scared</b> and want to protect your kids". Also in 2002, Ripley played Rose Bell in the ITV post-war period drama Dead Gorgeous, alongside Helen McCrory.

Energetic and often childish, Tart taunts Quiche for losing to the Mew Mews by saying he is weak.

Tartu shows a distinct dislike for Ichigo and refers to her as an [...] "old woman" [...] when they encounter one another, only to be called a [...] "midget" [...] in return. Midway through the series, Tart and Pie capture Bu-Ling and hold her hostage under the Tokyo Dome. While guarding her, Tart appears to be bewildered by her refusal <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>scared</b> and her attempts to befriend him. After she is freed by the others, he laughs while looking at some candy she gave him. The anime adaptation expands this incident by having Tart save Bu-Ling's life when she starts to suffocate after the cavern is sealed off. At the end of the manga Bu-Ling kisses him and he tells Bu-Ling that he might return to get another candy drop from her, and leaves for his own world. In the anime adaptation, Tart is killed by Pie when he tries to protect the Mew Mews, and revived by the final release of Mew Aqua {{at the end of the}} series.|$|E

[...] Lewis replied that he would if he had time but that he was busy trying to get his father, Elmo, out of jail in Tunica, for driving under the influence.

Just before three o'clock in the morning, Lewis accidentally smashed into the famous Graceland gates because [...] "the nose of that Lincoln was a mile long." [...] Presley's astonished cousin Harold Lloyd was manning the gate and watched Lewis attempt to hurl the champagne bottle through the car window, not realizing it was rolled up, smashing both. Bragg reports that Lewis denies ever intending to do Presley harm, that the two were friends, but [...] "Elvis, watching on the closed-circuit television, told guards to call the police. The Memphis police found the gun in the car and put Lewis, protesting, hollering, threatening 'the', away in handcuffs." [...] Lewis said, [...] "The cops asked Elvis, 'What {{do you want us to}} do?
