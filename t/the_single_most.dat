It reached South Africa in 1713, having been carried by ships from India, and in 1789 the disease struck Australia.

5|$|A {{follow-up}} study conducted 14 {{months after the}} original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>most</b> meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the {{benefits and harms of}} hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term positive impact on their sense of well-being.|$|E

Wheat formed <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>most</b> important arable crop, but rye, barley and oats were also cultivated extensively. In the more fertile parts of the country, such as the Thames valley, the Midlands and the east of England, legumes and beans were also cultivated.

Following a 1989 agreement, known as the cordon sanitaire, the party was effectively blocked from entering any level of government.

The ruling was made definite on 9 November 2004, and the party shortly after reorganised itself as the Vlaams Belang.

5|$|Beginning in the 1930s, {{however, the}} Argentine economy {{deteriorated}} notably. <b>The</b> <b>single</b> <b>most</b> {{important factor in}} this decline has been political instability since 1930, when a military junta took power, ending seven decades of civilian constitutional government. In macroeconomic terms, Argentina {{was one of the}} most stable and conservative countries until the Great Depression, after which it turned into one of the most unstable. Despite this, up until 1962 the Argentine GDP per capita was higher than of Austria, Italy, Japan and of its former colonial master, Spain. Successive governments from the 1930s to the 1970s pursued a strategy of import substitution to achieve industrial self-sufficiency, but the government's encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agricultural production, which fell dramatically.|$|E

5|$|In 1973 Roger Moore was {{appointed}} to the role of 007 for Live and Let Die and played Bond a further six times over twelve years before being replaced by Timothy Dalton for two films. After a six-year hiatus, during which a legal wrangle threatened Eon's productions of the Bond films, Irish actor Pierce Brosnan was cast as Bond in GoldenEye, released in 1995; he remained in the role for a total of four films, before leaving in 2002. In 2006, Daniel Craig was given the role of Bond for Casino Royale, which rebooted the series. The twenty-third Eon produced film, Skyfall, was released on 26 October 2012. The series has grossed almost $7 billion to date, making it the third-highest-grossing film series (behind Harry Potter and the films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe), and <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>most</b> successful adjusted for inflation.|$|E
5|$|Of the 21,000 civil {{aircraft}} {{registered in the}} UK, 96 per cent are engaged in GA operations, and annually the GA fleet accounts for between 1.25 and 1.35 million hours flown. <b>The</b> <b>single</b> <b>most</b> common class of aircraft is the fixed-wing light aircraft associated with traditional GA, but the main area of growth over the last 20 years {{has been in the}} use of more affordable aircraft, such as microlights, amateur built aeroplanes, and smaller helicopters. There are 28,000 Private Pilot Licence holders, and 10,000 certified glider pilots. Some of the 19,000 pilots who hold professional licences are also engaged in GA activities. Although GA operates from more than 1,800 aerodromes and landing sites, ranging in size from large regional airports to farm strips, over 80 per cent of GA activity is conducted at 134 of the larger aerodromes. The GA industry, which is around 7 per cent the size of its CAT cousin, employs 12,000 people, and contributes £1.4 billion to the UK economy.|$|E
5|$|Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, {{are created}} by cross joints.

Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as Half Dome and North Dome and inset arches like Royal Arches.|$|E

5|$|The Chronicle is not unbiased: {{there are}} {{occasions}} when {{comparison with other}} medieval sources {{makes it clear that}} the scribes who wrote it omitted events or told one-sided versions of stories; there are also places where the different versions contradict each other.

Much of the information given in the Chronicle is not recorded elsewhere. In addition, the manuscripts are important sources for the history of the English language; in particular, the later Peterborough text is one of the earliest examples of Middle English in existence.|$|E

Von Richthofen returned to Spain in overall command, with Hans Seidemann as chief of staff. This reinforcement may have been <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>most</b> important intervention by a foreign side in the war, enabling a counterattack after the Battle of the Ebro.
