5|$|Markway becomes {{alarmed at}} Eleanor's {{obsession}} with Hill House {{in spite of}} the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home. Before he can join her in the car, Eleanor drives off and speeds down the road toward the front gates. She soon feels the steering wheel move by itself and the car advances erratically. At first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. Suddenly Grace appears from behind a tree and steps in front of the car. Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her. He notes that the tree that claimed Eleanor's life is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted—to remain with the house.|$|E
5|$|Upon his return, {{he joined}} the staff of Brigadier General George F. Shepley, {{commanding}} the military district of Norfolk. When General Shepley was assigned as Chief of Staff to the XXV Corps commanded by Major General Godfrey Weitzel, de Peyster became an aide to Weitzel, and eventually his Chief of Staff. The unit de Peyster had originally joined, the 13th New York, was also assigned in the XXV Corps. He is credited with raising the first Union flag over the Confederate capitol of Richmond, Virginia after its fall. The flag was <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> had been raised over the city of New Orleans, Louisiana after its fall. Shepley had been the military Governor of New Orleans, and later the State of Louisiana while it flew there.|$|E
25|$|Crysis {{contains}} a level editor called Sandbox, much like Far Crys, in which new levels {{can be created}} and edited. Such levels will have full support in all multiplayer modes. This will allow the player to easily build their own levels, seeing everything in real time within the editor. The player can also jump into the map {{they are working on}} at any time to test it.

25|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at two separate recording studios. Parts of Del Cuore, including the forty-six-piece orchestra and 30-person choir, were recorded at the famous Capitol Studios in Los Angeles, California. This historic California landmark boasts an extraordinary roster of previous musicians including Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Bonnie Raitt, Harry Connick Jr., and Prince, {{to name a}} few. The microphone Carlos used for to record was the same microphone Frank Sinatra used while Recording at Capitol and the Piano used, was <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> Nat King Cole used to record at Capitol as well. The remainder of the album was recorded at the idyllic Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank, CA.|$|E
25|$|The {{speech that}} Jupiter uses {{to start the}} meeting is a {{finished}} piece of oratory. It opens with an exordium (1st strophe), in which, after an original welcome, Jupiter briefly defines the subject. This is followed, in the ancient rhetorical fashion, by the narration (the past shows that {{the intention of the}} Fados is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> the orator presented). There is then a confirmation of suggestions already put forth in the narration of the 4th strophe. This episode then ends with two strophes of peroration, where Jupiter appeals to the benevolence of the gods concerning the sons of Lusus, with Jupiter's speech eventually settling the debate.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{donations}} {{have been made}} {{under the name of}} Naoto Date, a character in the manga and anime Tiger Mask. In the manga and anime, Tiger Mask (whose real name was Naoto Date) was a feared heel wrestler in America who was extremely vicious in the ring. However, he became a face after returning to Japan when a young boy said {{that he wanted to be}} a villain like Tiger Mask when he grew up. The boy lived in an orphanage, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> Tiger Mask grew up in during his childhood. Feeling that he did not want the boy to idolize a villain, Tiger was inspired to be a heroic wrestler and fights for the children in the orphanage.|$|E

25|$|A {{land reform}} law, {{inspired}} by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> the Americans were enacting in occupied Japan, removed the landlord class (In {{a similar manner}} as Japan), and created a higher number of peasants whom, {{with the help of}} the state, increased the agricultural output dramatically. This was the first excedent accumulation source. It inverted capital creation, and liberated the agricultural workforce to work in the urban sectors. However, the government imposed on the peasants an unequal exchange with the industrial economy, with credit and fertilizer controls and a non monetary exchange to trade agrarian products (machinery) for rice. With the control of the banks (at the time, being the property of the government), and import licenses, the state oriented the Taiwanese economy to import substitutive industrialization, creating initial capitalism in a fully protected market.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} {{first decade of}} the 21st century, {{conservative}} religious leaders in northern Nigeria, suspicious of Western medicine, advised their followers not to have their children vaccinated with oral polio vaccine. The boycott was endorsed by the governor of Kano State, and immunization was suspended for several months. Subsequently, polio reappeared in a dozen formerly polio-free neighbors of Nigeria, and genetic tests showed the virus was <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> originated in northern Nigeria. Nigeria had become a net exporter of the polio virus to its African neighbors. People in the northern states were also reported to be wary of other vaccinations, and Nigeria reported over 20,000 measles cases and nearly 600 deaths from measles from January through March 2005. In 2006, Nigeria accounted for over half of all new polio cases worldwide. Outbreaks continued thereafter; for example, at least 200 children died in a late-2007 measles outbreak in Borno State.|$|E
25|$|PATH {{service to}} Lower Manhattan was {{restored}} when a new, $323 million second station opened on November 23, 2003; the inaugural train was <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> {{had been used}} for the evacuation. The second, temporary station contained portions of the original station, but did not have heating or air conditioning systems installed. The temporary entrance was closed on July 1, 2007, and demolished {{to make way for}} the third, permanent station; around the same time, the Church Street entrance opened. On April 11, 2007, the Port Authority announced that it will build a new entrance to the World Trade Center PATH station on Vesey Street. The new entrance opened in March 2008, and the entrance on Church Street has since been demolished. The contract to build the permanent World Trade Center PATH station, according to The Star-Ledger of Newark, was awarded to a joint-venture of Granite Construction North-East (formally Granite Halmar), Fluor Enterprises, Bovis Lend Lease, and Slattery Skanska. Platform A, the first platform of the permanent station, opened February 25, 2014, serving Hoboken-bound riders.|$|E

25|$|In the {{cardinal}} directions of Midwestern Native Americans, the wolf represented the west, but it represented the southeast for the Pawnee tribe. According to the Pawnee creation myth, the wolf {{was the first}} creature to experience death. The Wolf Star, enraged at not having been invited to attend a council on how the Earth should be made, sent a wolf to steal the whirlwind bag of The Storm that Comes out of the West, which contained the first humans. Upon being freed from the bag, the humans killed the wolf, thus bringing death into the world. Native Americans have long seen the wolf as an animal of power. Many tribes credit the actual creator of the earth to be a wolf. The Arikara and Ojibwe believed a wolfman spirit made the Great Plains for them and for other animals. Many tribes consider wolves to be closely related to humans. The reason for this belief {{is because of the}} wolf’s dedication to its pack, a trait the tribes attributed with themselves. The Navajo tribe was known for performing healing ceremonies where they would call upon wolves to restore health to their ill. Wolves were admired for their superb hunting skills.Prayers were offered in honor of wolves before they went out of hunting excursions. The Pawnee’s connection with wolves was so great that their hand signal for Pawnee was actually <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> they had for wolf. Before battles, Apache warriors would pray, sing, and dance to gain the teamwork, strength, and bravery of wolves.|$|E

Many chase shots were made using a Mercedes-Benz ML 55 pursuit vehicle with a camera boom mounted to the roof. Another rig involved towing the Warthog on a low trailer so that cameras could focus on an actor while the vehicle was being [...] "driven".|$|E

500|$|While {{developing}} the game, most of NST's efforts {{were focused on}} its multiplayer aspect because of its first-person shooter gameplay, and {{to take advantage of}} the Wi-Fi and voice chat capabilities of the Nintendo DS. One of the game's designers, Richard Vorodi, noted that [...] "the hardware kinda dictated [...]" [...] Wanting to introduce a new element to the Metroid series, Abe created several new bounty hunters after he realized that the game's multiplayer mode and the new bounty hunters could both be implemented seamlessly into the game: [...] "We had this idea early on and thought that would be a good way to introduce [...] and [...] to the gameplay and take advantage of that in the multiplayer." [...] Metroid Prime Hunters includes several references to previous games in the Metroid Prime series. Samus' ship is from the original Metroid Prime, and her suit is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> appears in Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. The developers decided to add them because they wanted to show that the technology has evolved, and they also wanted to include something that was instantly recognizable to those who had played previous games in the series. On level design, Abe said that as the game's controls shifted from an analog stick method to touchscreen aiming, the developers wanted to avoid making the gameplay and the control scheme more difficult.|$|E

Meanwhile, according to Forward.com, the American Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Congress, and the Confederation of Jewish Associations of Venezuela defended Chávez, stating that he was speaking not of Jews, but of South America's white oligarchy.
