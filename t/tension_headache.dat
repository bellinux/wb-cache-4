25|$|Children {{who have}} {{headaches}} {{will not necessarily}} have headaches as adults. In one study of 100 children with headache, eight years later 44% of those with <b>tension</b> <b>headache</b> and 28% of those with migraines were headache free. In another study of people with chronic daily headache, 75% did not have chronic daily headaches two years later, and 88% did not have chronic daily headaches eight years later.|$|E
2500|$|More than 90% of {{headaches}} are primary headaches.

25|$|The use of {{acupuncture}} in Germany {{increased by}} 20% in 2007, after the German acupuncture trials supported its efficacy for certain uses. In 2011, {{there were more}} than one million users, and insurance companies have estimated that two-thirds of German users are women. As a result of the trials, German public health insurers began to cover acupuncture for chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis of the knee, but not <b>tension</b> <b>headache</b> or migraine. This decision was based in part on socio-political reasons. Some insurers in Germany chose to stop reimbursement of acupuncture because of the trials. For other conditions, insurers in Germany were not convinced that acupuncture had adequate benefits over usual care or sham treatments. Highlighting the results of the placebo group, researchers refused to accept a placebo therapy as efficient.|$|E
500|$|As only 10 {{percent of}} people {{admitted}} to the emergency department with a thunderclap headache are having an SAH, other possible causes are usually considered simultaneously, such as meningitis, migraine, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Intracerebral hemorrhage, in which bleeding occurs within the brain itself, is twice as common as SAH and is often misdiagnosed as the latter. It {{is not unusual for}} SAH to be initially misdiagnosed as a migraine or <b>tension</b> <b>headache,</b> which can lead to a delay in obtaining a CT scan. In a 2004 study, this occurred in 12 percent of all cases and was more likely in people who had smaller hemorrhages and no impairment in their mental status. The delay in diagnosis led to a worse outcome. In some people, the headache resolves by itself, and no other symptoms are present. This type of headache is referred to as [...] "sentinel headache", because it is presumed to result from a small leak (a [...] "warning leak") from an aneurysm. A sentinel headache still warrants investigations with CT scan and lumbar puncture, as further bleeding may occur in the subsequent three weeks.|$|E

Allegations of witchcraft and the Occult found in the text, and legal disputes, one doctor coined the term [...] "Hogwarts headache" [...] {{in a letter to}} the New England Journal of Medicine shortly after the release of Order of the Phoenix, the longest book in the series, at 766 pages in the UK edition, 870 pages in the US edition, and over 250,000 words. He described it as a mild condition, a <b>tension</b> <b>headache</b> possibly accompanied by neck or wrist pains, caused by unhealthily long reading sessions of Harry Potter. The [...] "symptoms" [...] resolve themselves within days of finishing the book. His prescription of taking reading breaks was rejected by two of the patients on which he discovered this headache. Researchers in Oxford found that the admission rate of children with traumatic injuries to the city's ERs plummeted on the publication weekends of both Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince.|$|E

Tricyclic antidepressants appear to be useful for prevention. Tricyclic antidepressants {{have been found to}} be more effective than SSRIs but have greater side effects.
