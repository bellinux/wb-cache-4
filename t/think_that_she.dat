5|$|The {{character}} of Libby, played by Cynthia Watros, {{was introduced in}} this episode. Originally, Libby had been written {{to be in her}} late 40's or early 50's. Jennifer Jason Leigh was approached to play the part, but it went to Watros instead. When Watros auditioned for the part of Libby, she did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would end up being cast. Once she was, Watros and her twin daughters immediately moved from Los Angeles to Hawaii. Bernard is also introduced in this episode. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and made Bernard white to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only black man in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black man, when playing the scenes. When she found out Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked.|$|E

25|$|The Guardian {{reported}} on 4 July 2011 that Scotland Yard had discovered Dowler's voicemail had been accessed by journalists {{working for the}} News of the World and the newspaper's private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. The Guardian also reported that, during the police investigation into that newspaper's phone hacking activities, detectives discovered that journalists had deleted some messages—potential evidence—in Dowler's voicemail box because it was full, in order to free up space for new messages, to which they could listen. The deletions after Dowler was missing led family and friends to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was still alive. It was later reported that Dowler's phone automatically deleted messages 72 hours after they were listened to.|$|E

She blew a paper bag to fake a shot. Poirot claims to suspect Ruth because he {{suspected}} Ms Lingard would rescue her daughter and confess, and he had no evidence against Ms Lingard. After everyone leaves and Ms Lingard stays alone in the room, she asks Poirot not to tell Ruth that she is her real mother. Poirot agrees as Ms Lingard is terminally ill, and does not reveal anything to Ruth who wonders why Ms Lingard committed the murder.|$|E

Khan became a fan of rhythm and blues music as a pre-teen and at eleven formed a girl group, the Crystalettes, which included her sister Taka. In the late 1960s, Khan attended several civil rights rallies with her father's second wife, Connie, {{a strong supporter of}} the movement, and joined the Black Panther Party after befriending fellow member, activist, and Chicago native Fred Hampton in 1967. Though many <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was given the name Chaka while in the Panthers she {{has made it clear that}} her name Chaka Adunne Aduffe Hodarhi Karifi was given to her at age 13 by a Yoruba Baba. In 1969, she left the Panthers and dropped out of high school, having attended Calumet High School and Kenwood High School (now Kenwood Academy).

Reginald Beresford, a lawyer waiting in his car after he drove Richard to the house, comes inside. Reginald recognizes Jack, and the exposure of her fiancé makes Dale admit that she gave Wells the blueprint with the hidden room. Wells claims that he does not have the blueprint; Cornelia reveals other evidence incriminating him, and Anderson asks to question him alone. Wells knocks Anderson unconscious during the interrogation and drags him into another room. Before Wells can go to the hidden room, a stranger claiming to have lost his memory after he was attacked and tied up in the garage appears at the terrace door.

25|$|In {{the poem}} Lalla Radha and the Churel, a priest warns the protagonist to not go near the Peepul trees {{because that is}} where the Churel lives and she might take him away and kill him. He still went to the Peepul tree and she called out to him in a sweet tone and seduced him until he went to her. Blinded by his desire, he did not notice that while he lay with her, his body seemed to get frailer until he died in a state of ecstasy. In The Female Element in Indian Culture, it says, “The Churel runs after and seeks to possess every man whom she meets, for, it is said, her carnal {{appetite}} remains unsatisfied in life”. She also possesses girls during dances, causing a trance. According to Persian legend, when travelers saw the tracks of a Churel in the dirt they would try to flee by heading in the opposite direction, but her reversed feet would inevitably lead them right into her grasp. The Patari and Majhwar <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> appears to take her victims to the mountains and {{the only way they can}} be freed is if a goat is sacrificed.|$|E

I still get a lot of letters about her, too. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had as much of an impact as Janine (Charlie Brooks) did, which surprised me.

500|$|The song {{opens with}} a single crash cymbal {{followed}} by two bars of 4/4 drumming, then a plaintive three-note guitar line rings through a strummy rhythm, and Martin's vocals. Its instrumentation is varied {{with the sound of}} thumping drums, chiming guitars, a singalong chorus, and a string arrangement. The song also features a guitar lick swirl. The three lines of the third verse allude to a man's love of a woman, who does not reciprocate his love. He is saying he will always wait for her, but he does not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should stay where she is any longer. The lyrics emphasize: [...] "But I wait for you/if you go, if you go/leave me down here on my own/then I'll wait for you." [...] The song's lyrics also include references to a desire for weary optimism.|$|E
500|$|Yeah, I {{really felt}} {{at that point}} she was pretty strung out. Her whole world was rocked.

[...] the realisation that as soon as the baby's born the soul's going to go away, and it's the first time she really experienced true love, so she was going through a lot emotionally. I just didn't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would have time to really think about how she looked. I don't think it was a priority, and so for me as an actor it was important that I reveal that. Not get caught up in my own vanity as an actress, and portray the character as where she really was.|$|E

500|$|Anderson {{believed}} {{it was a bad}} idea for his character to get involved with a work colleague. Oliver began to doubt the relationship, and on Penny's advice, convinced Chrissie to break up with him without ruining his career. Chrissie took the break up well, and Hobley told What's on TV that her character did not mind, as [...] "it was only a bit of fun. She never planned on settling down with him." [...] It was then announced Chrissie would become pregnant with Oliver's child. Hobley assessed that Chrissie was surprised to learn that she was pregnant, but pleased, as she had lost a baby five years previously and did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was capable of conceiving another. Oliver was displeased by the news, but Chrissie had no expectations that he should provide for her. Her father, nursing consultant Mark Williams (Robert Powell), urged him to [...] "stand up to the mark and be a proper man". However, soon after, Chrissie miscarried their unborn baby.|$|E
