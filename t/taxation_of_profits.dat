25|$|Companies {{limited by}} shares also acquire finance through ‘equity’ (a synonym for the share capital). Shares differ from debt in that {{shareholders}} rank last in insolvency. The main justification for shareholders’ residual claim is that, unlike many creditors (though not large banks) {{they are capable}} of diversifying their portfolio. <b>Taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits</b> on shares can also be treated differently with a different tax rate (under the Income Tax Act 2007) to capital gains tax on debt (which falls under the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992). This makes the distinction between shares and debt important. In principle, all forms of debt and equity arise from contractual arrangements with a company, and the rights which attach are a question of construction. For instance, in Scottish Insurance Corp Ltd v Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd the House of Lords held that when the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946 was passed, preferential shareholders were entitled to no extra, special share of assets upon winding up: construction of the terms of the shares entitled them to extra dividends, but without special words to the contrary, shareholders were presumed equal otherwise. For anyone to become a member of a company under the Companies Act 2006 section 33, the contract for shares must simply manifest the intention to do so. However, beyond this, the dividing line between shares and debt is more a matter of standard practice than law. It is legally possible to {{become a member of the}} company without being a shareholder, simply by being accepted and registered on the members’ register. It is also possible to be a shareholder without being a member immediately. It is standard practice that shareholders have one vote per share, but occasionally shareholders (particularly those with preferential dividend rights) do not have votes, and debt holders and others may have votes without having shares. It is even possible for creditors to contract to be subordinated behind shareholders in insolvency – it is just unlikely, and strongly discouraged by the regulatory framework. Shares are also presumed to be transferable to other people, although like other rights, the right to trade is subject to the company’s constitution.|$|E

40|$|Taxing internationally mobile {{factors of}} {{production}} has been dismissed as an inefficient means of raising tax revenue. This paper addresses {{the question of whether}} it is efficient to tax capital at source when labor markets and the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> lumpsum income suffer from imperfections. Four reasons for taxing capital are identified: (i) institutional constraints rendering any <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> income infeasible; (ii) market power in the demand for labor; (iii) market power in the supply of labor if it increases with the employment of capital; (iv) unemployment benefits that are not tied to net real wages. It is argued that the case for taxing capital is not particularly strong. By reinterpreting capital as energy the results are applicable to the discussion about ecological tax reforms.

50|$|This {{reflects}} {{a more fundamental}} problem of legal consistency. People {{have the right to}} engage in some self-destructive activities. For all its carcinogenic qualities, tobacco is not a prohibited substance. Similarly, the excessive consumption of alcohol can have severe physical consequences, {{but it is not a}} crime to consume it. This is matched in gambling. The state and its institutions often rely on lotteries, raffles, and other legal forms of gambling for operating funds, whether directly or indirectly through the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits</b> from casinos and other licensed outlets. Qualitatively, there is nothing to distinguish the forms of gambling deemed illegal. A side effect of turning too many people into criminals is that the concept of crime becomes blurred and genuine criminality becomes less unacceptable. If the key distinction between real crime and moral regulation is not made clearly, as more consensual activities become crimes, ordinary citizens are criminalized for tax-evasion, illegal downloading, and other voluntary rule-breaking. A further perceptual problem emerges when laws remain in force but are obviously not enforced, i.e. the police reflect the consensus view that the activity should not be a crime. Alternatively, if the activities prohibited are consensual and committed in private, this offers incentives to the organizers to offer bribes in exchange for diverting enforcement resources or to overlooking discovered activity, thereby encouraging political and police corruption. Thus, any deterrent message that the state might wish to send is distorted or lost.|$|E

His campaign's closing rally, in Paris, was attended by 4,000, the largest meeting organised by the LCR or its predecessors since 1968.

40|$|The <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> {{corporate}} <b>profits</b> in the United States {{has been}} one of the most widely discussed issues in the area of public finance. Corporate revenues are currently subject to double taxation. Profits are taxed first at the corporate level and then, when distributed as dividends or when capital gains are realized, taxed a second time at the individual level. The share of tax revenues from corporate profits has been decreasing steadily over the past four decades. In 1962, corporate tax receipts accounted for 21 percent of all tax revenues, but, by 2003, their share dropped to 7. 5 percent. 1 In 2003, a proposal by the Bush Administration brought corporate tax integration back to the front pages.
