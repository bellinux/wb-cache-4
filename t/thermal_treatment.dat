5|$|Nanostructures of ZnO can be {{synthesized}} into {{a variety}} of morphologies including nanowires, nanorods, tetrapods, nanobelts, nanoflowers, nanoparticles etc. Nanostructures can be obtained with most above-mentioned techniques, at certain conditions, and also with the vapor-liquid-solid method. The synthesis is typically carried out at temperatures of about 90°C, in an equimolar aqueous solution of zinc nitrate and hexamine, the latter providing the basic environment. Certain additives, such as polyethylene glycol or polyethylenimine, can improve the aspect ratio of the ZnO nanowires. Doping of the ZnO nanowires has been achieved by adding other metal nitrates to the growth solution. The morphology of the resulting nanostructures can be tuned by changing the parameters relating to the precursor composition (such as the zinc concentration and pH) or to the <b>thermal</b> <b>treatment</b> (such as the temperature and heating rate).|$|E

Aggregates of AM were found by the <b>thermal</b> <b>treatments</b> at 42 and 45 degrees C, and the aggregates could be removed by centrifuging at 15, 000 g for 5 min. Otherwise, the AM aggregates induced by the other <b>thermal</b> <b>treatments</b> beyond 35 degrees C were still soluble in 0. 6 mol/l KCI- 20 mmol/l Tris-maleate buffer (pH 7. 0) even after centrifugation. Reactive sulfhydryl groups (R-SH) contents of AM showed the greatest amount in this study by 42 and 45 degrees C treatments, and those decreased almost 50 % by heating at 95 degrees C. Total sulfhydryl groups (T-SH) contents of AM decreased with elevating temperatures. This study revealed that <b>thermal</b> <b>treatments</b> beyond 45 degrees C induced AM to form a cluster of aggregates with noncovalent bonds; however, those beyond 75 degrees C induced AM to aggregate mostly attributed by disulfide bonds.

40|$|We {{report an}} {{experimental}} investigation by Raman and infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopies on the structural modifications induced by isochronal <b>thermal</b> <b>treatments</b> on amorphous SiO 2 nanoparticles (fumed silica). In particular, three different commercial types of this material, characterized by particle mean diameters of 7, 14, and 40 nm, {{were subjected to}} <b>thermal</b> <b>treatments</b> from 100 up to 1000 °C. We found that some properties of fumed silica, such as the SiOSi mean bond angle, ring size distribution, and surface adsorbed water content, are drastically {{different from those of}} common bulk silica materials and intimately related to the particles’ dimension. The SiOSi mean bond angle, probed by the main Raman line peaked at about 440 cm- 1, is modified by <b>thermal</b> <b>treatments</b> above 400 °C and tends toward typical values of bulk silica materials, whereas the three-membered ring population, probed by the D 2 line peaked at about 600 cm- 1, changes but does not reach bulk silica features. The surface adsorbed water content, estimated by IR measurements, gradually decreases, starting from 100 °C. The peculiar properties of fumed silica, which suggest a strained atomic network structure, together with the investigation of its modifications induced by <b>thermal</b> <b>treatments,</b> are interpreted in terms of a shell-like model of the constituting particles. In particular, the model assumes that each particle comprises a surface shell characterized by a network structure highly strained and a core shell with a less strained structure more similar to that of bulk silica. This model, discussed on the basis of our experimental results, suggests that the structural property modifications induced by <b>thermal</b> <b>treatments</b> into the surface shell are related to the dehydroxylation process and to the buildup of particle-to-particle linking (sintering effects), whereas the structural modifications into the core shell arise from the network relaxation activated by <b>thermal</b> <b>treatments...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} “in situ” <b>thermal</b> <b>treatments</b> (by DSC measurements) on the {{martensitic}} transformation in two representative Ni-Fe-Ga and Ni-Mn-Ga alloys {{has been studied}} and discussed by correlating the structural and magnetic properties. The alloys were prepared from high purity elements, by arc melting under argon protective atmosphere as bulk and also as melt-spun ribbons - an alternative preparation route that also allows to assess the influences of grains size and strain induced by this processing method. All samples presented reversible thermo-elastic transformations. The <b>thermal</b> <b>treatments</b> promote a reduction of the martensitic transformation temperatures in the Ni-Fe-Ga investigated samples, {{as opposed to the}} stoichiometric Ni 2 MnGa where the temperatures increase with increasing the annealing temperatures. Interestingly however, the off-stoichiometric Ni-Mn-Ga with increased Ni content recovers the behaviour with reduction of transformation temperatures by <b>thermal</b> <b>treatments.</b> The precipitation of the secondary FCC (γ) phase is inherently found in Ni-Fe-Ga alloys with Ga ≤ 27 % at, and also -although in lower amounts- in the off-stoichiometric Ni-Mn-Ga. The γ phase is considered to contribute to the decrease of the MT temperatures (via valence electrons concentration depletion of the main matrix) and of the transformation heat {{as well as to the}} final structural degradation if the temperature of the <b>thermal</b> <b>treatments</b> is further increased. In addition, this phase, located mainly at the grain boundaries, is responsible for the improved ductility of Ni-Fe-Ga based alloys. Changes in the transformation heat due to <b>thermal</b> <b>treatments</b> are observed and discussed in both types of alloys, the maxima of the transformation heat being associated with the highest atomic order.
