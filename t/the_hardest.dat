According to Pirelli, <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> tyre compound available is just 31% harder than the softest compound on offer; by comparison, <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> tyres used in 2011 were 70% harder than the softest.|$|E

5|$|As in {{the cases}} of most other {{refractory}} metals, <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> known compounds of tantalum are its stable nitrides and carbides. Tantalum carbide, TaC, like the more commonly used tungsten carbide, is a very hard ceramic that is used in cutting tools. Tantalum(III) nitride is used as a thin film insulator in some microelectronic fabrication processes. Chemists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States have developed a tantalum carbide-graphite composite material that is one of <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> materials ever synthesized. Korean researchers have developed an amorphous tantalum-tungsten-copper alloy that is more flexible and two to three times stronger than commonly used steel alloys. There are two tantalum aluminides, TaAl3 and Ta3Al. These are stable, refractory, and reflective, and they have been proposed as coatings for use in infrared wave mirrors.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} model wherein collusive firms' {{decisions}} to keep or to destroy <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> evidence is endogenous. Unlike previous literature, {{we assume that}} the administration of the cartel crucially depends on the existence of <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> evidence. Within this framework, we explore the impact of a leniency program on whether firms' incentives are to destroy or to keep <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> evidence. Moreover, we examine firms' incentives to report or not to report <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> evidence to <b>the</b> antitrust authority. We show that firms may willfully keep <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> evidence, even if a leniency program is not available, in order to enhance the stability of the cartel. Additionally, we prove that firms are more inclined to keep <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> evidence when a leniency program is available. Finally, we demonstrate that firms are more likely to destroy <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> evidence when <b>the</b> collusive profits-fine ratio increases. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{contend that}} IT {{outsourcing}} management has two sides. While <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> side {{refers to the}} contract, the soft side refers to trust. My analysis of 50 IT outsourcing efforts shows that both <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> side and <b>the</b> soft side are key to success. <b>The</b> <b>hard</b> side and <b>the</b> soft side are often used separately.

5|$|Diamond {{hardness}} {{depends on}} its purity, crystalline perfection and orientation: hardness is higher for flawless, pure crystals oriented to the <111> direction (along the longest diagonal of the cubic diamond lattice).
