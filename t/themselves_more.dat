5|$|Children, ages 11–17, {{volunteer}} to become altar servers {{not only to}} serve the church {{but also because it}} has always been looked upon as an honor. It is a chance for children to serve their priest and become closer to Jesus by being on the altar. In addition, it is an opportunity for them to try to make <b>themselves</b> <b>more</b> holy and therefore more worthy of the position.|$|E
5|$|Evolve is {{an action}} video {{game with a}} focus on both co-operative, and competitive, {{multiplayer}} gameplay. The game adapts a '4v1' asymmetrical structure where four players take control of the Hunters, while the fifth player controls the Monster. The Hunters' main objective is to track and hunt the Monster in a limited amount of time, while the Monster's goal is to evolve and make <b>themselves</b> <b>more</b> powerful.|$|E
5|$|The public roads {{from the}} Indianapolis corner to the Porsche Curves were re-surfaced. Run-off areas at the Dunlop Chicane, Tertre Rouge, Indianapolis, and Ford Chicanes were also {{partially}} asphalted {{in order to}} avoid gravel being brought back onto the circuit by cars which had gone off course. This also increased safety by allowing the cars to slow <b>themselves</b> <b>more</b> efficiently using their brakes and tyres on tarmac.|$|E

5|$|Gwyneth {{stands in}} the middle of an arch and opens the rift, {{allowing}} the Gelth to cross over. The number of Gelth is much greater than anticipated, and their true motive is revealed: they intend to kill the living to give <b>themselves</b> <b>more</b> hosts and take over the planet. One of the animated bodies strangles Sneed to death, allowing another Gelth to possess his body. Dickens flees the parlour, and Rose and the Doctor are trapped in a part of the basement. Outside, Dickens realises that the beings are affected by gas and returns to the house. He extinguishes the gaslights and turns the gas on full, pulling the Gelth out of the bodies. The Doctor tells Gwyneth to send the Gelth back and close the rift, but she cannot close it or leave. Instead she takes out a box of matches, intending to ignite the gas and kill the Gelth along with herself. The Doctor determines that Gwyneth is already dead, and that by opening the rift, she had doomed herself. The Doctor, Rose, and Dickens flee the parlour just before it explodes and burns, killing Gwyneth and the Gelth.|$|E
5|$|PlayStation Home is a {{community-based}} social gaming networking {{service for}} the PlayStation 3 on the PlayStation Network (PSN). It is available directly from the PlayStation 3 XrossMediaBar. Membership is free, and only requires a PSN account. Home has been in development since early 2005 and started an open public beta test on December 11, 2008. Home allows users to create a custom avatar, which {{can be made to}} suit the user's preference. Users can decorate their avatar's personal apartment ("HomeSpace") with default, bought, or won items. They can travel throughout the Home world (except cross region), which is constantly updated by Sony and partners. Each part of the world is known as a space. Public spaces can just be for display, fun, or for meeting people. Home features many mini-games which can be single player or multiplayer. Users can shop for new items to express <b>themselves</b> <b>more</b> through their avatars or HomeSpace. Home features video screens in many places for advertising, but the main video content is shown at the theatre for entertainment. Home plays host to a variety of special events which range from prize-giving events to entertaining events. Users can also use Home to connect with friends and customize content. Xi, a once notable feature of Home, is the world's first console based Alternate Reality Game that took place in secret areas in Home and was created by nDreams.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} the member clubs are owned by major Korean Chaebols, and the club names reflect that fact.

25|$|A survey {{published}} in 2001, by the Centre for Research into Elections and Social Trends at Oxford University (sample size 1161), found that 14.6 per cent of respondents {{described themselves as}} British, not Welsh; 8.3 per cent saw <b>themselves</b> as <b>more</b> British than Welsh; 39.0 per cent described themselves as equally Welsh and British; 20.2 per cent saw <b>themselves</b> as <b>more</b> Welsh than British; and 17.9 per cent described themselves as Welsh, not British.|$|R
25|$|The {{formation}} of a biofilm begins with the attachment of free-floating microorganisms to a surface. It is thought that the first colonist bacteria of a biofilm adhere to the surface initially through weak, reversible adhesion via van der Waals forces and hydrophobic effects. If the colonists are not immediately separated from the surface, they can anchor <b>themselves</b> <b>more</b> permanently using cell adhesion structures such as pili.|$|E
25|$|The {{album is}} the first without {{founding}} bassist Mark McClelland and represents a step forward for the band. Simpson feels that the album is more confident that its predecessor, as the band pushed <b>themselves</b> <b>more</b> than ever before during its sessions, and had {{a better understanding of}} music. According to him, the album title does not mean anything specific and that it can have its own meaning to different people.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to going}} solo, Lo {{was the lead}} vocalist in the Hong Kong indie rock band Black & Blue, which {{released}} two albums: Hope in Just One Day (1995) containing songs mostly sung in English; and Black & Blue (1996) which was sung completely in Cantonese, a decision made with their record label to make <b>themselves</b> <b>more</b> understandable to fans. Lo wrote all the lyrics to the songs on both albums.|$|E

25|$|This means, by definition, {{that for}} all x in A, x∈B {{if and only if}} x∉f(x). For all x the sets B and f(x) cannot be the same because B was {{constructed}} from elements of A whose images (under f) did not include <b>themselves.</b> <b>More</b> specifically, consider any x∈A, then either x∈f(x) or x∉f(x). In the former case, f(x) cannot equal B because x∈f(x) by assumption and x∉B by the construction of B. In the latter case, f(x) cannot equal B because x∉f(x) by assumption and x∈B by the construction of B.|$|E
25|$|Once an {{eruption}} occurs, a large CO2 cloud forms above {{the lake and}} expands to the neighbouring region. Because CO2 is denser than air, it {{has a tendency to}} sink to the ground while pushing breathable air up. As a result, life forms that need to breathe oxygen suffocate once the CO2 cloud reaches them, as there is very little oxygen in the cloud. The CO2 can make human bodily fluids very acidic, potentially causing CO2 poisoning. As victims gasp for air they actually hurt <b>themselves</b> <b>more</b> by inhaling the CO2 gas.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd George {{had a long}} {{conversation}} (15 February) with Major Berthier de Sauvigny, a French {{liaison officer}} in London, telling him that Haig needed to be subordinated to Nivelle for the offensive, as George Milne had been subordinated to Sarrail at Salonika, and if necessary he would be replaced. The British War Cabinet felt that the French generals and staff had shown <b>themselves</b> <b>more</b> skilled than the British in 1916, whilst politically Britain had to give wholehearted support to what {{would probably be the}} last major French effort of the war.|$|E

25|$|Although men {{and women}} lie at equal frequencies, {{men are more likely}} to lie in order to please {{themselves}} while {{women are more likely to}} lie to please others. We are individuals living in a world of competition and strict social norms, where we are able to use lies and deception to enhance our chances of survival and reproduction. Stereotypically speaking, men like to exaggerate about their sexual expertise but shy away from topics that degrade them while women understate their sexual expertise to make <b>themselves</b> <b>more</b> respectable and loyal in the eyes of men and avoid being labelled as a ‘scarlet woman’.|$|E
25|$|Many {{insects are}} pollinators, {{particularly}} bees, Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), wasps, flies, ants and beetles. On the other hand, some plants are generalists, being pollinated by insects in several orders. Entomophilous plant species have frequently evolved mechanisms to make <b>themselves</b> <b>more</b> appealing to insects, e.g., brightly coloured or scented flowers, nectar, or appealing shapes and patterns. Pollen grains of entomophilous plants are generally {{larger than the}} fine pollens of anemophilous (wind-pollinated) plants, which has to be produced in much larger quantities because such a high proportion is wasted. This is energetically costly, but in contrast, entomophilous plants have to bear the energetic costs of producing nectar.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} make {{patients}} feel more comfortable, the patient care providers make <b>themselves</b> <b>more</b> approachable, therefore more readily open to multiple levels of personal connections. Such personal connections {{have the ability to}} uplift patients’ spirits and secure confidentiality. Utilization of the quality of time spent with the patient proves to be beneficial. By being available for a proper amount of time, patients open up and disclose personal stories, which enable psychiatric/mental health nurses to understand the meaning behind each story. The outcome results in nurses making every effort to attaining a non-biased point of view. A combination of being there and being available allows empirical connections to quell any negative feelings within patients.|$|E
