50|$|Awareness of the {{toxicity}} of terrestrial dusts has increased greatly since the original Apollo flights, which occurred circa 1970, {{in which the}} crew members were exposed to lunar dust for a relatively brief time. The first National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) was issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1971 and was indexed to <b>total</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> (TSP) on a mass per unit volume basis. In 1987, this NAAQS was refined to include only particles that were of less than 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) because this was the size that was most likely to reach the bronchial tree {{and deeper into the}} lung. Finally, in 1997, the EPA Administrator issued standards for particles that were less than 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) based primarily on epidemiological associations of increased mortality, exacerbation of asthma, and increased hospital admissions for cardiopulmonary symptoms. None of these standards specified the composition of the particles. In fact, the last standard was a bit contentious because mechanisms of toxic action were not understood.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE:We {{compared}} {{the adverse effects}} of two types of real ambient particles; i. e., <b>total</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> from an electrostatic precipitator of a steel mill and fine air particles from an urban ambient particulate matter of 2. 5 µm, on mucociliary clearance. METHOD:Mucociliary function was quantified by mucociliary transport, ciliary beating frequency {{and the amount of}} acid and neutral mucous in epithelial cells through morphometry of frog palate preparations. The palates were immersed in one of the following solutions: <b>total</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> (0. 1 mg/mL), particulate matter 2. 5 µm 0. 1 mg/mL (PM 0. 1) or 3. 0 mg/mL (PM 3. 0) and amphibian Ringer&# 8217;s solution (control). Particle chemical compositions were determined by X-ray fluorescence and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. RESULTS:Exposure to <b>total</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> and PM 3. 0 decreased mucociliary transport. Ciliary beating frequency was diminished by <b>total</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> at all times during exposure, while particulate matter of 2. 5 µm did not elicit changes. Particulate matter of 2. 5 µm reduced epithelial mucous and epithelium thickness, while <b>total</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> behaved similarly to the control group. <b>Total</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> exhibited a predominance of Fe and no organic compounds, while the particulate matter 2. 5 µm contained predominant amounts of S, Fe, Si and, to a lesser extent, Cu, Ni, V, Zn and organic compounds. CONCLUSION:Our results showed that different compositions of particles induced different airway epithelial responses, emphasizing that knowledge of their individual characteristics may help to establish policies aimed at controlling air pollution...|$|E

In {{some parts of the}} world, organic compounds make up the majority of the <b>total</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particle</b> mass. This class of particulate matter is important {{in a wide range of}} geophysical and environmental problems, ranging from local issues (e. g., pollution toxicity) to the global scale (e. g., climate change). Unfortunately, the richness of organic chemistry and the highly variable physical properties associated with both natural and anthropogenic organic particles lead to great difficulties in sampling and obtaining complete chemical information on these materials.

PAHs are mostly formed during incomplete combustion or pyrolysis of organic material. According to Serbian National Legislation, benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) concentration in <b>total</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> (TSP) in ambient air in the Belgrade metropolitan area has been determined in the last ten years, as a part of a local air pollution monitoring program performed by the Public Health Institute of Belgrade and funded by Belgrade’s Municipality.

The normalized distribution of n-alkanes with the peak at C- 22, C- 23, C- 24 or C- 25 suggested that fossil fuel utilization was {{the major source of}} particulate n-alkanes at both sites. PAHs normalized distribution for each sample was similar and the higher molecular weight PAH dominated the profile (around 90 %) indicating a stronger combustion source at both sites. Precipitation and wind were the most important meteorological factors influencing TSP and PAHs atmospheric concentrations. In the urban area the emission height had significant influence on PAHs levels at different heights under the relative stable atmospheric conditions. Coal combustion was the major source for TSP-bound PAHs at both sites based on some diagnostic ratios. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

This paper explores the major sources of pollutants <b>total</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> and lead concentration, a key contributor to the smog in Faisalabad, {{one of the largest}} cities in Pakistan. Evidence indicates that the <b>total</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> and lead concentration formed through NOx, SOx, NH 3, VOCs, etc. have a strong impact on human health. As a result, air pollution control should not simply focus on controlling particulate emission, but should involve adopting an integrated multi pollutant control strategy. In addition to identifying the major sources of air pollution, this paper explores its impact on environmental and human health. The results also compare with the permissible limit of NEQS and USEPA standards. The study shows that TSP concentration 80 % values within the permissible limits of ambient air quality according to the standards of USEPA and NEQS. In the samples, Lead concentration is higher than the USEPA and NEQS standards of ambient air quality 1. 5 µg/m 3 and 2 µg/m 3 respectively.

We studied concentrations of ammonia, endotoxin, and total and respirable dust particles in four mechanically ventilated swine nurseries and two grower facilities using an ammonia sampler, filter, and British cyclone. In {{two of the}} nursery facilities, we determined the protection offered by respiratory masks that were mounted on glass funnels with filters or British cyclones and sampled for dust. In response to the increasing summer ventilation, large, nonrespirable particle concentrations in swine building atmospheres were reduced more completely by ventilation air movement than smaller respirable particles or ammonia.

Discharges from the hospital of children under 14 years of age represented 56 % of 33, 952 discharges recorded in all age groups. Trends of adult hospitalization rates over time remained stable during the study period. In children, however, {{there was an increase}} in these rates, particularly marked in the age group of 1 to 4 years. Univariate analysis revealed a strong correlation between quarterly mean TSP and hospital discharge rate for the 1 to 4 -year-old children (r =. 62, P <. 001). In the 5 to 14 -year-old age group, there was an inverse relationship between hospital discharge rate and sulfur dioxide level (r = -. 38, P <. 05). Stepwise multiple regression analysis, controlling for confounding variables (seasonal and annual trends of asthma hospitalizations) confirmed these relationships. A highly significant linear regression equation was derived between hospitalization rate for ages 1 to 4 years and <b>total</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> (P <. 001).

The airborne fungal community in these samples was analyzed using the Illumina Miseq platform with fungi-specific primers targeting the internal transcribed spacer 1 region of the large subunit rRNA gene. A total of 797, 040 reads belonging to 1, 633 operational taxonomic units were observed. Of these, 1, 102 belonged to Ascomycota, 502 to Basidiomycota, 24 to Zygomycota, and 5 to Chytridiomycota. The dominant orders were Capnodiales (27. 95 %), Pleosporales (26. 8 %), Eurotiales (10. 64 %), and Hypocreales (9. 09 %). The dominant genera were Cladosporium, Alternaria, Fusarium, Penicillium, Sporisorium, and Aspergilus. Analysis of similarities revealed that both particulate matter sizes (R= 0. 175, p= 0. 001) and air quality levels (R= 0. 076, p= 0. 006) significantly affected the airborne fungal community composition. The relative abundance of many fungal genera was found to significantly differ among various PM types and air quality levels. Alternaria and Epicoccum were more abundant in <b>total</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> samples, Aspergillus in heavy-haze days and PM 2. 5 samples, and Malassezia in PM 2. 5 samples and heavy-haze days. Canonical correspondence analysis and permutation tests showed that temperature (p< 0. 01), NO 2 (p< 0. 01), PM 10 (p< 0. 01), SO 2 (p< 0. 01), CO (p< 0. 01), and relative humidity (p< 0. 05) were significant factors that determine airborne fungal community composition. The results suggest diverse airborne fungal communities are associated with particulate matters, and may provide reliable data for studying the responses of human body to the increasing level of air pollution in Beijing...|$|E
40|$|Particulate matter {{emission}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} air pollution problems of coal fired power plants. Though fine particles constitute a smaller fraction by weight of the <b>total</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particle</b> matter in typical particle emissions, they are considered potentially hazardous to health because of their high probability of deposition in deeper parts of the respiratory tract. Electrostatic precipitators (ESP) are the most common, effective and reliable particulate control devices which can handle large gas volumes with a wide range of inlet temperatures, pressures, dust volumes and acid gas conditions. Though the electrostatic precipitators are generally running at the collection efficiency as high as 99. 95 %, the anticipated regulations on particulate matters of 2. 5 microns (PM 2. 5) have led the local power station to explore improvement options to further control the emissions of the fine particulate at a minimum cost even its current particulates emissions are well under the limits of its current environmental license. The performance of Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP) is significantly affected by its complex flow distribution. In this study the gas flow through the ESP at a local power station is modelled numerically using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code Fluent to give insight to the flow behavior inside the ESP. The flow simulation was performed using the Realizable k-e model. The results of the simulation are discussed and compared with on-site measured data supplied by the power plant...|$|R

40|$|Published data on {{indoor air}} {{contaminants}} in livestock buildings in Saudi Arabia are relatively scarce. The main {{objective of this}} study was to determine the airborne concentrations of particles and electrostatic charge acquired by airborne particles in a multiple tier housing system (Manure Belt Cage System) under the climatic conditions of Saudi Arabia. In this house, the mean of <b>total</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particle</b> (TSP) concentration was 0. 99 mg/m 3, the PM 10 concentration (particulate matter with a diameter less than or equal to 10 µm) was 0. 47 mg/m 3, and the PM 2. 5 concentration (particulate matter with a diameter less than or equal to 2. 5 µm) was 0. 05 mg/m 3. The particle size distribution results obtained from the layer house revealed that the GMD (geometric mean diameter) was 6. 95 µm, based on the mass concentration of the particles. Alternatively, based on the number concentration of particles, the GMD was 0. 82 µm. The cumulative percentage of mass concentration for the particles ranging from 0. 3 – 10 ?m showed that the major fraction of the particles was larger than 2. 5 ?m (> 85 %). The net charge-to-mass ratio (q N) of airborne particles was - 0. 86 mC/kg (s. d. = 0. 27). The measured q N value of airborne particles in the layer house varied due to the nature of the particles in addition to the environmental conditions and high concentration of airborne particles inside the poultry housing. In general, PM concentrations did not exceed the recommended values and those cited in literature. </p...|$|R
