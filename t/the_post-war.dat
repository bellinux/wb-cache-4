5|$|In early 1944, the Royal Navy Flower-class {{corvette}} Mallow {{was transferred}} to the KJRM-in-exile as Nada. Several pre-war KJRM ships and transferred vessels which survived the war continued their service with <b>the</b> <b>post-war</b> Yugoslav Navy. <b>The</b> <b>post-war</b> Yugoslav Navy drew its insignia and traditions from the Partisan naval forces that evolved from armed fishing vessels operated along the Adriatic coast from late 1942, so few of the traditions of the KJRM were carried over to <b>the</b> <b>post-war</b> navy.|$|E

50|$|The bullet-trap {{rifle grenade}} became {{increasing}} popular in <b>the</b> <b>post-wars</b> <b>the</b> years, {{most notably the}} French AC58 anti-armour and APAV40 multi-purpose grenades.

All current NATO rifles are capable of launching STANAG 22mm rifle grenades from their flash hiders without the use of an adapter.|$|R

5|$|During {{the years}} of World War II, {{evacuated}} and orphaned children were the subjects of studies that outlined their reactions to separation, including the ability to cope by forming relationships with other children. Some of this material remained unpublished until <b>the</b> <b>post-war</b> period and only gradually contributed to understanding of young children's reactions to loss.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic {{separation}} for {{uranium enrichment}} was abandoned in <b>the</b> <b>post-war</b> period {{in favor of}} the more complicated, but more efficient, gaseous diffusion method. Although most of the calutrons of the Manhattan Project were dismantled {{at the end of the}} war, some remained in use to produce isotopically enriched samples of naturally occurring elements for military, scientific and medical purposes.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> largest <b>post-war</b> {{increase}} in French migration to Australia {{came during the}} 1960s and 1970s; unlike many other European countries, France did not establish a migration scheme in <b>the</b> immediate <b>post-war</b> period due to chronic underemployment, despite Australia seeing the French {{as some of the}} most desirable immigrants to obtain during that era.|$|R
50|$|The {{creation}} of the PDP has its premises {{in the context of}} <b>the</b> immediate <b>post-war,</b> <b>the</b> reintegration of Catholics in the nation by the wartime Union sacrée and the involvement of Catholics in power during the National Bloc (1919-1924).|$|R

5|$|Images of trench warfare became iconic {{symbols of}} human {{suffering}} and endurance. <b>The</b> <b>post-war</b> world had many veterans who were maimed or damaged by shell shock.

5|$|In 1956, over 9,000 socialist and populist {{politicians}} were released from prison. A few Jewish functionaries {{of the security}} forces were brought to court in the process of de-Stalinization. According to Heather Laskey, it was not a coincidence that the high ranking Stalinist security officers put on trial by Gomułka were Jews. Władysław Gomułka was captured by Światło, imprisoned by Romkowski in 1951 and interrogated by both, him and Fejgin. Gomułka escaped physical torture only as a close associate of Joseph Stalin, and was released three years later. According to some sources, the categorization {{of the security forces}} as a Jewish institution—as disseminated in <b>the</b> <b>post-war</b> anticommunist press at various times—was rooted in Żydokomuna: the belief that the secret police was predominantly Jewish became one of the factors contributing to <b>the</b> <b>post-war</b> view of Jews as agents of the security forces.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>post-War</b> years, translucent, molded plastic, electrified, lit-from-within tree toppers in {{the shape}} of angels and stars became popular.

Glass spire ornaments were also popular as toppers.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} debates on the actual taking of the Bastille in 1789 has been {{the nature of the}} crowds that stormed the building. Hippolyte Taine argued in the late 19th century that the crowd {{consisted}} of unemployed vagrants, who acted without real thought; by contrast, <b>the</b> <b>post-war</b> left-wing intellectual George Rudé argued that the crowd was dominated by relatively prosperous artisan workers. The matter was reexamined by Jacques Godechot in <b>the</b> <b>post-war</b> years; Godechot showing convincingly that, in addition to some local artisans and traders, at least half the crowd that gathered that day were, like the inhabitants of the surrounding faubourg, recent immigrants to Paris from the provinces. Godechot used this to characterise the taking of the Bastille as a genuinely national event of wider importance to French society.|$|E
5|$|Rees {{writes that}} Gröning {{describes}} {{his time at}} Auschwitz {{as if he were}} talking about another Oskar Gröning at Auschwitz — and as a result, <b>the</b> <b>post-war</b> Gröning speaks more candidly about his time there by segregating the Gröning that contributed to the running of a death camp from the modern Gröning that condemns Nazi ideology.|$|E
