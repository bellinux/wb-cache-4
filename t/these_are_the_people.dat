It also cited the arrest of an unnamed dissident army captain on 27 October as the organiser of the countercoup attempt and reported that two other unnamed government critics were assaulted and left outside Bissau. Army Chief of Staff General Antonio Indjai laughed off questions {{that he was the}} power behind the throne and responded to the criticism in saying: [...] "People say I’m a drug trafficker. Anybody who has the proof, present it! We ask the international community to give us the means to fight drugs." [...] Gonzalez-Ducay then responded: [...] "I can't believe that the one who controls the drug trafficking is going to fight the drug trafficking." [...] The U.S. State Department's Foreign Service Officer for Guinea-Bissau Russell Hanks, who is not present in the country following the U.S. shutting its embassy during the Bissau-Guinean Civil War in 1998, said: [...] "You will only have an impact on this transition by engagement, not by isolation. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who came in {{to pick up the pieces}} after the coup." [...] His staff pointed to photographs of newly created stretches of road in a remote rural area near the Senegal border that had space for small planes to land and they suggested was under the supervision of the armed forces. Chief of Guinea-Bissau's judicial police João Biague reported on a dubious aircraft landing months before the coup near Indjai's farm. He also added that [...] "The traffickers know [...] can't do much. The agents we have in the field want to give up because they have nothing to eat." [...] Guinea-Bissau's former prosecutor general added: [...] "A country that’s not capable of discussing its own problems — it's not a country, it's not a state." ...|$|E

60|$|Many {{people have}} been puzzled {{by the fact that}} whilst stage {{entertainments}} which are frankly meant to act on the spectators as aphrodisiacs, are everywhere tolerated, plays which have an almost horrifyingly contrary effect are fiercely attacked by persons and papers notoriously indifferent to public morals on all other occasions. The explanation is very simple. The profits of Mrs Warren's profession are shared not only by Mrs Warren and Sir George Crofts, but by the landlords of their houses, the newspapers which advertize them, the restaurants which cater for them, and, in short, all the trades to which they are good customers, not to mention the public officials and representatives whom they silence by complicity, corruption, or blackmail. Add to these the employers who profit by cheap female labor, and the shareholders whose dividends depend on it [you find such people everywhere, even on the judicial bench and in the highest places in Church and State], and you get a large and powerful class with a strong pecuniary incentive to protect Mrs Warren's profession, and a correspondingly strong incentive to conceal, from their own consciences no less than from the world, the real sources of their gain. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who declare that it is feminine vice and not poverty that drives women to the streets, as if vicious women with independent incomes ever went there. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who, indulgent or indifferent to aphrodisiac plays, raise the moral hue and cry against performances of Mrs Warren's Profession, and drag actresses to the police court to be insulted, bullied, and threatened for fulfilling their engagements. For please observe that the judicial decision in New York State in favor of the play does not end the matter. In Kansas City, for instance, the municipality, finding itself restrained by the courts from preventing the performance, fell back on a local bye-law against indecency to evade the Constitution of the United States. They summoned the actress who impersonated Mrs Warren to the police court, and offered her and her colleagues the alternative of leaving the city or being prosecuted under this bye-law.|$|E

If they would only show you a masterpiece of art, or a venerable tomb, or a prison-house, or a battle-field, hallowed by touching memories or historical reminiscences, or grand traditions, and then step aside and hold still for ten minutes and let you think, it would not be so bad. But they interrupt every dream, every pleasant train of thought, with their tiresome cackling. Sometimes when I have been standing before some cherished old idol of mine that I remembered years and years ago in pictures in the geography at school, I have thought I would give a whole world if the human parrot at my side would suddenly perish where he stood and leave me to gaze, and ponder, and worship.|$|E

In some distant {{parts of the world}} it may be that an Englishman acknowledges his permanent resting place; but there are many others in which he will not call his daily house, his home.

On the whole I remained [...] convinced of two things: first, that his heart is still altogether [...] with us; secondly, that his health, though requiring great care, [...] is really equal to the moderate demands we should make upon him. [...] The truth is I was quite as much knocked up with our conversation [...] as he was, but then I had the more active share. In the whole [...] range of subjects that we travelled over, we came to no point of [...] sharp difference, and I feel confident that he could work with the [...] cabinet as harmoniously and effectually as before. In saying this [...] I should add that I told him, with respect to economy, that I [...] thought we should now set our faces in that direction. I told him [...] that we should not expect of him ordinary night attendance in the [...] House of Commons, and that his attendance in the cabinet was the [...] main object of our desire. He was pleased and touched with our [...] desire, and he has not rejected the proposal. He has intimated [...] doubts and apprehensions, but he reserves it for consideration, [...] and seemed decidedly pleased to learn that the question might be [...] held open until the meeting of parliament in case of need.... I [...] did not think it fair to put to him the request by which I [...] endeavoured to hold him in December 1868, viz.: that he would not [...] determine in the matter without seeing me again; but I begged and [...] pressed that he should in no case refuse without taking the [...] opinion of a first-rate London physician, as <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> [...] whose wide experience best enables them to judge in such cases. [...] Altogether my experience of him was extremely pleasant, and he was [...] popular beyond measure in the house, where the guests were one or [...] two ladies and four gentlemen, Sir G. Prevost, a high church (but [...] most excellent) archdeacon, John Murray, the tory publisher, and [...] Hayward—whom to describe it needs not. One and all were charmed [...] with Bright. In his character the mellowing process has continued [...] to advance, and whatever he may have been thirty years ago, he is [...] now a gentle and tender being. Yesterday he had five hours of [...] conversation with me and much with others, also {{an hour and a half}} [...] walk in the rain, which seemed to do him no harm whatever.
