5|$|Both of Jackson's {{parents have}} denied <b>the</b> <b>longstanding</b> abuse {{allegations}} and Katherine acknowledges {{that although the}} whippings are viewed as child abuse by current generations, such disciplinary methods were normal back then.

5|$|Jackson {{and some}} of his {{siblings}} said they had been physically and psychologically abused by their father, Joseph Jackson. In 2003, Joseph admitted to whipping them as children, but has emphatically rejected <b>the</b> <b>longstanding</b> abuse allegations. The whippings deeply traumatized Jackson and may have led to the onset of further health issues later in his life. Physicians speculated that he had body dysmorphic disorder.|$|E

5|$|Thierry Henry is the club's top goalscorer with 228 {{goals in}} all {{competitions}} between 1999 and 2012, having surpassed Ian Wright's total of 185 in October 2005. Wright's record had stood since September 1997, when he overtook <b>the</b> <b>longstanding</b> total of 178 goals set by winger Cliff Bastin in 1939. Henry also holds the club record for goals {{scored in the}} League, with 175, a record that had been held by Bastin until February 2006.|$|E
5|$|Dallas {{was elected}} {{as part of}} a {{coalition}} between the Democratic Party organization and reforming independents who wished to challenge the Republican city government. The reforms in question focused many on shifting power from the city council to the mayor and in converting <b>the</b> <b>longstanding</b> patronage system to convert to a merit system of city employment. Her reformist tendencies clashed with some of the party organization, and she went down to defeat in 1955. After a second career as a newspaper editor and investment banker, she retired in 1978 and died in 1983.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, after {{constructing}} two {{welfare reform}} bills that Clinton vetoed, Gingrich {{and his supporters}} pushed for passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced <b>the</b> <b>longstanding</b> Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients. The bill {{was signed into law}} by President Clinton on August 22, 1996.|$|E

5|$|In {{attempting}} {{to present the}} character as a figurative mirror to Batman, the costume worn by Anarky in Beware the Batman was radially redesigned as entirely white, in contrast to Batman's black Batsuit. It consists of a tightly worn jumpsuit, cape, hood, flexible mask with white-eye lenses, and a utility belt. Upon the chest is a small, stylized circle-A in black. The design was negatively compared by reviewers to <b>the</b> <b>longstanding</b> design for Moon Knight, a Marvel Comics superhero.|$|E
5|$|In {{pursuing}} the Clinton administration's energy objectives through {{construction of the}} $4.5 billion Afghanistan Oil Pipeline, Raphel created ill will with Afghanistan's Northern Alliance, then {{under the command of}} Ahmad Shah Massoud. Massoud-controlled militias blocked the pipeline's northern access route due to <b>the</b> <b>longstanding</b> civil war with Taliban forces. After Massoud was killed September 9, 2001 in a Taliban bombing, Raphel's critics accused her of collaborating with the Taliban to advance American commercial interests even as the group gave refuge to Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and other senior al-Qaeda leaders in the time leading up to the September 11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|Instrumentally, the {{two worlds}} {{represented}} within the opera are distinctively portrayed. The pastoral world of the fields of Thrace {{is represented by the}} strings, harpsichords, harp, organs, recorders and chitarroni. The remaining instruments, mainly brass, are associated with the Underworld, though there is not an absolute distinction; strings appear on several occasions in the Hades scenes. Within this general ordering, specific instruments or combinations are used to accompany some of the main characters—Orpheus by harp and organ, shepherds by harpsichord and chitarrone, the Underworld gods by trombones and regal. All of these musical distinctions and characterisations were in accordance with <b>the</b> <b>longstanding</b> traditions of the Renaissance orchestra, of which the large L'Orfeo ensemble is typical.|$|E

5|$|The club {{achieved}} mid-table league {{positions for}} two seasons, {{but they were}} relegated in 1934 as a penalty for breaking amateur regulations. The club had paid their players a small sum of money for each game. Although against the rules, this was common at the time; Malmö FF were the only club to show it in their accounting records. In addition to relegation to Division2, the club suffered bans for the entire {{board of directors and}} twenty-six players. The version of events told by Malmö FF and local press suggests that local rival IFK Malmö reported the violation to the Swedish Football Association. This belief has contributed to <b>the</b> <b>longstanding</b> competitive tensions between the clubs.|$|E
5|$|The old bronze penny was {{slated for}} {{elimination}} as decimal currency was planned in the 1960s. It {{continued to be}} struck after 1967, still bearing that date. The 97 percent copper, 0.5 percent tin, 2.5 percent zinc alloy was used again for the 1960s pennies. Finally, there was an issue of proof quality coins dated 1970 for collectors, to bid farewell to a denomination which had served the country well for 1200 years. <b>The</b> <b>longstanding</b> depiction of Britannia on the penny was translated by sculptor Christopher Ironside to the post-decimal fifty-pence coin.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>longstanding</b> {{danger of}} a Portuguese attack, the {{situation}} of the Spanish force in Badajoz was dreadful. The garrison suffered from a lack of ammunition and supplies, the soldiers were dressed in rags or were practically nude, and there was none among the civilian population of the town trained to wield a weapon. The Duke of San German put soldiers and civilians to work on the fortifications and storing food. The Portuguese sappers, meanwhile, proceeded to prepare the field for an assault upon the fortress. Mendes de Vasconcelos had decided, in a war council with many other senior officers, to attack Fort San Cristóbal, a key point in the Badajoz defenses. This fort, built after 1640, covered a bridgehead over the Guadiana river, thus guarding access to the city. A redoubt was quickly strengthened on the bridgehead by the Spanish sappers, who, protected by the Duke of Osuna and his cavalry, also widened the trenches which connected it with Fort San Cristóbal, the garrison of which was being strengthened every day along a strongly defended communication road.|$|E
5|$|Empress Shulü Ping, {{who became}} known as Empress Dowager Yingtian {{following}} the death of her husband, was an exceptionally powerful figure both before and after Taizu's death. While the latter was alive, Shulü Ping commanded an army of 200,000 horsemen that was tasked with maintaining order while Taizu led military campaigns abroad. She also led campaigns herself. Following the death of her husband, the Empress rejected the traditional Khitan custom of being buried with him, and elected to cut off her right hand and bury that with the Emperor instead. Shulü Ping then seized full military and civil authority in order to oversee the imperial succession under her own terms. The Empress's refusal to kill herself and be buried with Taizu effectively ended <b>the</b> <b>longstanding</b> custom.|$|E
5|$|In November 2011, {{a lock of}} John Paul II's {{hair was}} brought to the cathedral after the Holy See granted the Diocese of Hong Kong a relic from the late pontiff.

He had constantly stated his intent of visiting the country, but never did so due to <b>the</b> <b>longstanding</b> tensions and strained relations between China and the Holy See. Bishop John Tong Hon expressed his hope that the relic would be able to venerated by the Mainland Chinese faithful who visited Hong Kong, the only city on Chinese soil and the first city in Asia to house a relic of John Paul II.

5|$|Keeping up <b>the</b> <b>longstanding</b> {{tradition}} of Massachusetts Bay, Phips {{fought against the}} office of custom inspectors, arguing that the port of Massachusetts did not see enough enumerated goods to warrant their presence. Instead Phips attempted to re-establish a naval office, with himself acting {{as head of the}} admiralty, thereby doling out favors to gain the support of the powerful merchant class. This was part of an old turf battle between the Admiralty and Customs but it led to an altercation with Randolph's custom inspector, Jahleel Brenton, which seemed to follow the similar embarrassing and unseemly pattern as his altercation with Captain Short. The two altercations weighed together against Phips. Phips was accused of violating the Navigation Acts, as his predecessor had been. Blathwayt was slowly and steadily working to standardize the flow of tributes from the colonies to the Crown, and if Phips was clogging these pipes he would need to answer for it.|$|E
5|$|One {{week after}} Super Millionaire {{came to an}} end, Ken Jennings of Salt Lake City, Utah, became the new {{champion}} on Jeopardy!

With no limit to his appearances, Jennings began to break many game show records. As his streak continued deeper into the 21st season, Jennings was inching closer and closer to Olmstead's record. Jennings topped Olmstead's Millionaire winnings with his 65th consecutive win, finishing the day with $45,099 and a new cumulative total of $2,197,000.|$|E
