5|$|At {{its most}} fundamental, {{it was a}} local feud between two {{competing}} dynastic interests—the Seneschals (Truchsess) of the House of Waldburg and the dukes of the House of Wittelsbach—that acquired religious overtones. The dispute had broad implications in the political, social, and dynastic balance of the Holy Roman Empire. It tested <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of ecclesiastical reservation established in the religious Peace of Augsburg (1555). The 1555 agreement settled religious problems in the Empire with <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> Cuius regio, eius religio: the subjects of a secular prince followed the religion of their sovereign. Ecclesiastical reservation excluded the territories of the imperial prelates (bishops, archbishops, abbots or abbesses) from cuius regio, eius religio. In an ecclesiastical territory, if the prelate changed his religion, his subjects {{did not have to}} do so. Instead, the prelate was expected to resign from his post.

The work on developing <b>the</b> <b>Principles</b> of Good Administration began in 2005, with <b>the</b> <b>Principles</b> being progressively reduced in number and clarified for ease of understanding.
