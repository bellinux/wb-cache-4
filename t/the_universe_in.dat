5|$|Bhikshatana is {{considered}} a gentler form of Shiva's fierce aspect Bhairava and a gentle phase between Bhairava's two gruesome forms, one of which decapitates the god Brahma and the other of which murders the god Vishnu's gatekeeper. Bhikshatana is the form of Bhairava that Shiva assumes to atone for his sin of severing Brahma's fifth head. He wanders <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>in</b> {{the form of a}} naked Kapali mendicant, begging for alms with Brahma's kapala (skullcap) as his begging bowl, until his sin is expiated upon reaching the holy city of Varanasi.|$|E

5|$|The third Tom Swift series {{differs from}} the first two in that the setting is {{primarily}} outer space, although Swift Enterprises (located now in New Mexico) is occasionally mentioned. Tom Swift explores <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>in</b> the starship Exedra, using a faster-than-light drive he has reverse-engineered from an alien space probe. He is aided by Benjamin Franklin Walking Eagle, a Native American who is Tom's co-pilot, best friend, and an expert computer technician, and Anita Thorwald, a former rival of Tom's who now works with him as a technician and whose right leg has been rebuilt to contain a miniature computer.|$|E
5|$|With {{advent of}} {{automated}} telescopes {{and improvements in}} spectroscopes, a number of collaborations {{have been made to}} map <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>in</b> redshift space. By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky. These observations are used to measure properties of the large-scale structure of the Universe. The Great Wall, a vast supercluster of galaxies over 500 million light-years wide, provides a dramatic example of a large-scale structure that redshift surveys can detect.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle, {{a student}} of Plato, {{observed}} an occultation of Mars by the Moon in 365 BCE. From this he concluded that Mars must lie further from the Earth than the Moon. He noted that other such occultations of stars and planets had been observed by the Egyptians and Babylonians. Aristotle used this observational {{evidence to support the}} Greek sequencing of the planets. His work De Caelo presented a model of <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>in</b> which the Sun, Moon, and planets circle about the Earth at fixed distances. A more sophisticated version of the geocentric model was developed by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus when he proposed that Mars moved along a circular track called the epicycle that, in turn, orbited about the Earth along a larger circle called the deferent.|$|E

5|$|Fez is a {{two-dimensional}} (2D) puzzle platform game {{set in a}} three-dimensional (3D) world. The player-character Gomez lives peacefully on a 2D plane until he receives a red fez and witnesses the breakup of a giant, golden hexahedron that tears the fabric of spacetime and reveals a third dimension. After the game appears to glitch, reset, and reboot, the player can rotate between four 2D views of the 3D world, as four sides around a cube-like space. This rotation mechanic reveals new paths through the levels by connecting otherwise inaccessible platforms, and {{is the basis of}} Fez puzzles. For example, floating platforms become a solid road, discontinuous ladders become whole, and platforms that move along a track stay on course. The object of the game is to collect cubes and cube fragments, which accrete to restore order to <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> <b>In</b> search of these cubes, Gomez traverses the game environment by jumping between ledges. Other platforming elements change with the level themes, including crates that activate switches, bombs that reveal passages, and pistons that launch Gomez airborne.|$|E
5|$|Gods {{were linked}} with {{specific}} regions of <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> <b>In</b> Egyptian tradition, the world includes the earth, the sky, and the Duat. Surrounding {{them is the}} dark formlessness that existed before creation. The gods in general were said to dwell in the sky, although gods whose roles were linked with {{other parts of the}} universe were said to live in those places instead. Most events of mythology, set in a time before the gods' withdrawal from the human realm, take place in an earthly setting. The deities there sometimes interact with those in the sky. The Duat, in contrast, is treated as a remote and inaccessible place, and the gods who dwell there have difficulty communicating with those {{in the world of the}} living. The space outside the cosmos is also said to be very distant. It too is inhabited by deities, some hostile and some beneficial to the other gods and their orderly world.|$|E
5|$|He was {{a friend}} of Queen guitarist and {{astrophysicist}} Brian May, who was an occasional guest on The Sky at Night. May bought Moore's Selsey home in 2008, leasing it back to him for a peppercorn rent the same day to provide financial security. May, Moore and Chris Lintott co-wrote a book Bang! The Complete History of <b>the</b> <b>Universe.</b> <b>In</b> February 2011, Moore completed (with Robin Rees and Iain Nicolson) his comprehensive Patrick Moore's Data Book of Astronomy for Cambridge University Press. In 1986 he was identified as the co-author of a book published in 1954 called Flying Saucer from Mars, attributed to Cedric Allingham, which was intended as a money-making venture and practical joke on UFO believers; Moore never admitted his involvement. He once joined the Flat Earth Society as an ironic joke.|$|E

5|$|In 1844, the Scottish {{publisher}} Robert Chambers anonymously {{published an}} extremely controversial but widely read book entitled Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. This book proposed an evolutionary scenario for {{the origins of}} the Solar System and of life on Earth. It claimed that the fossil record showed a progressive ascent of animals, with current animals branching off a main line that leads progressively to humanity. It implied that the transmutations lead to the unfolding of a preordained plan that had been woven into the laws that governed <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> <b>In</b> this sense it was less completely materialistic than the ideas of radicals like Grant, but its implication that humans were only the last step in the ascent of animal life incensed many conservative thinkers. The high profile of the public debate over Vestiges, with its depiction of evolution as a progressive process, would greatly influence the perception of Darwin's theory a decade later.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{announced}} at Comic-Con 2009 {{that it was}} overseeing production {{of a series of}} seven short anime films, together called Halo Legends. Financed by 343 Industries, the animation was created by five Japanese production houses: Bones, Casio Entertainment, Production I.G., Studio 4Â°C, and Toei Animation. Shinji Aramaki, creator and director of Appleseed and Appleseed Ex Machina, served as the project's creative director. Warner Bros. distributed Legends on DVD and Blu-ray in February 2010. Six of the stories are officially part of the Halo canon, with the seventh, made by Toei, intended to be a parody of <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> <b>In</b> mid-July 2015, 343 Industries announced that a new animated series of Halo will be included in the Halo 5: Guardians Limited Edition and Collector's Edition called , and will be based on the book Halo: The Fall of Reach by Eric Nylund.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{pressure}} {{is believed to}} be a property of vacuum energy, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos. According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>in</b> the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as dark energy becomes even more dominant.|$|E

5|$|The Genocide run {{requires}} the player to kill all monsters and maximize their LOVE. As Frisk reaches Asgore's castle, Sans attempts to stop them, but Frisk kills him along with Asgore and Flowey. Chara materializes after Flowey is killed and explains {{that they were}} resurrected by the player's LOVE. The player is then asked to join them {{in the destruction of}} the universe, which occurs regardless of the player's choice.

5|$|There are {{dynamical}} forces {{acting on}} the particles in the Universe which affect the expansion rate. Before 1998, {{it was expected that}} the rate of increase of the Hubble Constant would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the Universe, and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the Universe called the deceleration parameter which cosmologists expected to be directly related to the matter density of <b>the</b> <b>Universe.</b> <b>In</b> 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be consistent with â1 but not zero, which implied that the present-day rate of increase of the Hubble Constant is increasing over time.|$|E
5|$|Ethnologists and anthropologists {{who study}} myths have {{developed}} various classification schemes {{for the various}} themes that appear in creation stories. For example, in one type of story, the world is born from a world egg; such stories include the Finnish epic poem Kalevala, the Chinese story of Pangu or the Indian Brahmanda Purana. In related stories, the Universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept of Adi-Buddha, the ancient Greek story of Gaia (Mother Earth), the Aztec goddess Coatlicue myth, the ancient Egyptian god Atum story, and the Judeo-Christian Genesis creation narrative in which the Abrahamic God created <b>the</b> <b>Universe.</b> <b>In</b> another type of story, the Universe is created from the union {{of male and female}} deities, as in the Maori story of Rangi and Papa. In other stories, the Universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead godâ as from Tiamat in the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish or from the giant Ymir in Norse mythologyâ or from chaotic materials, as in Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology. In other stories, the Universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as Brahman and Prakrti, the creation myth of the Serers, or the yin and yang of the Tao.|$|E

5|$|Since Georges LemaÃ®tre first {{noted in}} 1927 that an {{expanding}} universe could {{be traced back}} in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion. The scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different theories, the Big Bang and the Steady State theory, but a wide range of empirical evidence has strongly favored the Big Bang which is now universally accepted. In 1929, from analysis of galactic redshifts, Edwin Hubble concluded that galaxies are drifting apart; this is important observational evidence consistent with the hypothesis of an expanding universe. In 1964, the cosmic microwave background radiation was discovered, which was crucial evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, since that theory predicted the existence of background radiation throughout the universe before it was discovered. More recently, measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that {{the expansion of the universe}} is accelerating, an observation attributed to dark energy's existence. The known physical laws of nature can be used to calculate the characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>in</b> detail {{back in time to}} an initial state of extreme density and temperature.|$|E
