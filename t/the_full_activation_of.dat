It has been shown that the SFFVp glycoprotein, gp 55, interacts with the erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R) and promotes EPO-independent proliferation of an EPO-R-expressing hematopoietic cell line, Ba/F 3 (Liet al., Nature 343 : 762, 1990). We show here that when residues within the transmembrane (TM) sequence of an SFFVp gp 55 are altered based on the sequences of the anemia-inducing gp 55 s by a methionine-to-isoleucine (M-I) substitution, a di-leucine deletion (dLL), or both, the resulting mutants display an attenuated phenotype that resembles an SFFVa: they induce milder erythroproliferative disease without polycythemiain vivoand are unable to promote EPO-independent cell proliferationin vitro. The dLL mutation directly interferes with EPO-R binding by decreasing the affinity of gp 55 for the receptor. On the other hand, the M-I mutation hampers <b>the</b> <b>full</b> mitogenic <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> EPO-R while having no effect on receptor binding and asserts a dominant negative effect over the wild-type SFFVp gp 55.

Results: The authors report in this study the qualitative modelling and simulation of the transcriptional regulatory network controlling the response of the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the agricultural fungicide mancozeb. The model allowed the analysis of the regulation level and activity of the components of the gene mancozeb-induced network controlling the transcriptional <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> the FLR 1 gene, which is proposed to confer multidrug resistance through its putative role as a drug eflux pump.

40|$|ABSTRACT The double sucrose-gap {{method was}} applied to single muscle fibers of Xenopus. From the "artificial node " of the fiber, action {{potentials}} were recorded under current-clamping condition together with twitches of the node. The action potentials were stored on magnetic tape. The node was then made inexcitable by tetrodotoxin or by a sodium-free solution, and the wave form of the action potential stored on magnetic tape was imposed on the node under voltage-clamp condition (simulated AP). The twitch height caused by the simulated AP's was always smaller than the twitch height produced by the real action potentials, the ratio being about 0. 3 at room temperature. The results strongly suggest that the transverse tubular system is excitable and is necessary for <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> twitch, and that the action potential of the tubules contributes to about 70 % of the total mechanical output of the normal isotonic twitch at 200 °C. Similar results were obtained {{in the case of}} tetanic contraction. At a temperature near 100 C, twitches produced by the simulated AP were not very different (85 % of control amplitude) from the twitches caused by real action potentials.

Although the downstream events in TNF-α signaling are better understood, the membrane-proximal events are still elusive. Here, we demonstrate that TNF-α and cellular stresses induce TRAF 2 phosphorylation at serine 11 and that this phosphorylation {{is required for the}} expression of a subset of NF-κB target genes. Although TRAF 2 phosphorylation had a minimal effect on the TNF-α-induced rapid and transient IKK activation, it was essential for secondary and prolonged IKK activation. Consistent with this, TRAF 2 phosphorylation is not required for its recruitment to the TNFR 1 complex in response to TNF-α stimulation but is required for its association with a cytoplasmic complex containing RIP 1 and IKK. In addition, TRAF 2 phosphorylation was essential for <b>the</b> <b>full</b> TNF-α-induced <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> JNK. Notably, TRAF 2 phosphorylation increased both basal and inducible c-Jun and NF-κB activities and rendered cells resistant to stress-induced apoptosis. Moreover, TRAF 2 was found to be constitutively phosphorylated in some lymphomas.

This tissue retraction is partly active due to traction forces exerted by the cells and partly passive due to release of residual stress in the extracellular matrix and the cells. Within this study, we unraveled the passive and active contributions of cells and matrix to generated force and retraction in engineered heart valve tissues. Tissue engineered rectangular strips, fabricated from PGA/P 4 HB scaffolds and seeded with human myofibroblasts, were cultured for 4 weeks, after which the cellular contribution was changed at different levels. Elimination of the active cellular traction forces was achieved with Cytochalasin D and inhibition of the Rho-associated kinase pathway. Both active and passive cellular contributions were eliminated by lysation and/or decellularization of the tissue. Maximum cell activity was reached by increasing the fetal bovine serum concentration to 50 %. The generated force decreased ~ 20 % after elimination of the active cellular component, ~ 25 % when the passive cellular component was removed as well and remained unaffected by increased serum concentrations. Passive retraction accounted for ~ 60 % of total retraction, of which ~ 15 % was residual stress in the matrix and ~ 45 % was passive cell retraction. Cell traction forces accounted for the remainder ~ 40 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retraction. <b>Full</b> <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cells increased retraction by ~ 45 %. These results illustrate {{the importance of the}} cells in the process of tissue retraction, not only actively retracting the tissue, but also in a passive manner to a large extent. © 2012 The Author(s) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Investigations {{toward the}} {{understanding}} of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) have been directed, so far, to the study of mechanisms leading to the disease. We believe that understanding why ~ 80 % of smokers evade COPD and how this evasion is accomplished might be a fruitful endeavour that could advance knowledge of the development of the disease. Since the inflammatory infiltrate smokers develop seems to be the key element leading to the lung destruction in COPD, {{the understanding of}} the possible ways inflammation can be dampened, as well as its consequences, ought to be important. We review here some of the mechanisms by which inflammation is controlled: by the post-translational regulons, by <b>the</b> mechanisms preventing <b>full</b> <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> dendritic cells and by the regulatory T-cells. The potential role of the M 2 alveolar macrophage phenotype and the newly described myeloid-derived suppressor cells is mentioned. We also point out that evasion comes at a price, as healthy smokers might be immunosuppressed to some extent and unable to prevent the development of cancer, certainly less so than in severe COPD, where immunity is heightened. Probably, the knowledge of the mechanisms of evasion from COPD could add significantly to the understanding of those leading to the disease...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a micro-fluid gathering tool for a versatile capsular endoscope that employs a solid chemical propellant, azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN). The proposed tool {{consists of a}} micro-heater, an AIBN matrix, a Venturi tube, a reservoir, an inlet, and an outlet. The micro-heater heats the AIBN matrix to be decomposed into by-products and nitrogen gas. This nitrogen gas generates negative pressure passing through the Venturi tube. The generated negative pressure inhales a target fluid from around the inlet into the reservoir. All the parts {{are designed to be}} embedded inside a cylindrical shape with a diameter of 17 mm and a height of 2. 3 mm in order to integrate it into a versatile developmental capsular endoscope without any scaledown. Two sets of the proposed tools are fabricated and tested: one is made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and the other is made of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). In performance comparisons, the PDMS gathering tool can withstand a stronger pulling force, and the PMMA gathering tool requires a less negative pressure for inhaling the same target fluid. Due to <b>the</b> instant and <b>full</b> <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thin AIBN matrix, both types of gathering tool show analogous performance in the sample gathering evaluation. The gathered volume is approximately 1. 57 μL using approximately 25. 4 μL of AIBN compound...|$|R
