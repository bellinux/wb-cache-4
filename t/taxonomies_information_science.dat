50|$|The {{variations}} in natural language definitions {{of what constitutes}} an organ, their degree of precision, and the {{variations in}} how they map to ontologies and <b>taxonomies</b> in <b>information</b> <b>science</b> (for example, to count how many organs exist in a typical human body) are topics explored by writer Carl Engelking of Discover magazine in 2017 as he analyzed the science journalism coverage of the evolving scientific understanding of the mesentery. He explored a challenge now faced by anatomists: as human understanding of ontology generally (that is, how things are defined, and how the relationship of one thing to another is defined) meets applied ontology and ontology engineering, unification of varying views is in higher demand. However, such unification always faces epistemologic frontiers, as humans can only declare computer ontologies with certainty and finality {{to the extent that}} their own cognitive taxonomy (that is, science's understanding of the universe) is certain and final. For example, the fact that the tissues of the mesentery are continuous was something that was simply not known for sure until it was demonstrated with microscopy. Because humans cannot predict all future scientific discoveries, they cannot build a unified ontology that is totally certain and will never again change. However, one of the points made by an anatomist interviewed by Engelking is that, finality aside, much more could be done even now to represent existing human knowledge more clearly for computing purposes.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{first part}} of this paper {{examines}} some of the difficulties for the historian of <b>information</b> <b>science</b> that arise from the lack of agreement as to what precisely constitutes <b>information</b> <b>science</b> and from its commonly accepted interdisciplinary nature. It examines in this connection Machlup and Mansfield's ideas about a &quot;narrow &quot; <b>information</b> <b>science</b> and <b>information</b> <b>science</b> as a composite of disciplinary chunks. Regardless of these issues, it demonstrates that the history of <b>information</b> <b>science</b> is gaining an identity both biblio-graphically and socially. The second part of the paper suggests that as a condition of their organization, reproduction, and control all societies have evolved their own distinctive ways of managing information. Ultimately, then, the history of <b>information</b> <b>science</b> can be considered to extend far beyond the last 50 years where attention is commonly focused. Drawing on Brandel's notions, dur~e Iongue, moyenne and courte, the paper suggests an approach to periodicity that provides a new perspective for the history <b>information</b> <b>science.</b> The paper also introduces the notions of synchrony and diachrony to suggest other approaches to the historical study of aspects of <b>information</b> <b>science.</b> The paper concludes that the history of <b>information</b> <b>science</b> is an historical interdiscipline and those interested in it nee...|$|R
