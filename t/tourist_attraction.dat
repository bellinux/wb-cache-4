40|$|Extract] <b>Tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> are {{frequently}} {{described as the}} key components of a destination's tourism industry. While they have received increasing attention from researchers, attractions continue to be poorly understood, with research lacking conceptual sophistication and depth (Richards, 2002). <b>Tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> serve two key functions in the tourism system: they stimulate interest in travel to a destination, and they provide visitor satisfaction (Gunn, 1994). Yet the role of <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> in the post-modern world is changing. Consumer demands and competitive innovations are driving this change, which is resulting in a more multifaceted, fragmented <b>attraction</b> sector. <b>Tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> are proliferating in terms of form, location, scale and style. The following discussion explores our current understanding of <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> and also a series of trends that will influence attractions over the next twenty years...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The National Department of Tourism (NDT) {{identified}} the underutilisation of <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> {{as a challenge}} facing South Africa’s tourism. According to eThekwini Municipality (2014) and Gauteng Provincial Government (2001), domestic business tourists, amongst others, visit <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions.</b> The likelihood of business tourists requesting that hotel front office staff arrange visits to <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> is acknowledged in the literature. There is, however, a dearth of research investigating the relationship between hotel front office staff and business tourists’ intentions to visit <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> (hereafter mostly referred to as business tourists’ visiting intentions). The conceptualisation of this relationship is discussed {{in the context of}} hotel front office staff, interest in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions,</b> and business tourists’ visiting intentions. The proposed mediating role of Interest in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> is highlighted, which was tested statistically, while evidence is provided that Hotel front office staff, Interest in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions,</b> and Business tourists’ visiting intentions can serve in a causal Model of Business Tourist’s Intentions of Visiting <b>Tourist</b> <b>Attractions.</b> The inclusion of these constructs in a causal model will enable hotel and <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> managers develop strategies to attract business tourists. Main research question Against the background of Frazier, Tix and Barron’s (2004) and Ro’s (2012) Mediation Model, see section 1. 3, the following main research question was proposed for the present study: Is the relationship between Hotel front office staff and Business tourists’ visiting intentions mediated by Interest in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> in a Model of Business Tourists’ Intentions of Visiting <b>Tourist</b> <b>Attractions?</b> Literature review Based on the main research question, this study resulted in the proposal of a theoretical causal model for the mediating role of <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> and a causal Model of Business Tourists’ Intentions of Visiting <b>Tourist</b> <b>Attractions.</b> The likelihood of the newly conceptualised Interest in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> as a mediator in the relationship between the Hotel front office staff and Business tourists’ visiting intentions is evident in tourism literature. As far as could be determined, the influence of interest in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> in the relationship between hotel front office staff and business tourists’ visiting intentions has not been established to date. An extensive literature review was conducted to conceptualise hotel front office staff, interest in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions,</b> and business tourists’ visiting intentions as constructs to include in the theoretical model from which the causal model was developed. Business tourists’ demographic details were investigated in the context of gender, age, and province. Research design A research design comprises the research approach and research method of a study. In the present research, a cross-sectional survey was conducted to generate the study’s primary data. A statistical study design was adopted for the purpose of conducting factor analysis (FA) and validating the causal model by means of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) through structural equation modelling (SEM). Furthermore, this study was causal-explanatory, as it explored the mediating role of Interest in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions.</b> International Business Machines (IBM) software SPSS 22. 0 was used to conduct this study’s FA, and IBM SPSS AMOS 22. 00 was used for this study’s CFA through SEM. Research method Convenience sampling, which is a non-probability sampling method, was used to select the respondents. The target population was domestic business tourists who stayed at the selected three-star hotel between 15 July 2014 and 15 April 2015. A new measuring instrument was developed to comprehensively investigate hotel front office staff, interest in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions,</b> and business tourists’ visiting intentions. A seven-point intensity Likert scale was used for all items in the questionnaire. Data were collected by means of a self-administered questionnaire issued to domestic business tourists upon hotel check-in. The sample comprised 282 respondents. Results and discussion Data sets for all constructs were inspected for central tendency, distribution, and missing values. Missing values were replaced by the respective items’ mean score. Once inspected, PCA was conducted to explore the uni-dimensionality of items, and to reduce constructs. All constructs were retained by the PCA, and the achievement of Cronbach alpha scores exceeding. 70 confirmed the validity and reliability of constructs (Hotel front office staff, Interest in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions,</b> and Business tourists’ visiting intentions). PCA was not conducted on Business Tourists’ Visiting Intentions, due to a significant Cronbach’s alpha and the presence of only four items measuring the construct. Pearson’s product-moment correlation revealed positive inter-correlations between dimensions of the constructs Hotel front office staff and Interest in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions.</b> CFA was conducted to establish the causal Model of Business Tourists’ Intentions of Visiting <b>Tourist</b> <b>Attractions.</b> The establishment of a causal model was followed by exploring the mediating effect of Interest in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> on the relationship between Hotel front office staff and Business tourists’ visiting intentions. The causal model confirmed that Interest in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> fully mediates the relationship between Hotel front office staff and Business tourists’ visiting intentions. This successfully answered this study’s main research question. This study makes a unique contribution by establishing a causal Model of Business Tourists’ Intentions of Visiting <b>Tourist</b> <b>Attractions,</b> confirming Interest in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> as a mediator in the relationship between Hotel front office staff and Business tourists’ visiting intentions. The causal model proves that there is no relationship between Hotel front office staff and Business tourists’ visiting intentions without the indirect connection with Interest in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions.</b> In support of this study’s results, Yang, Jou, and in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions,</b> and business tourists’ visiting intentions.

This study makes a unique contribution by establishing a causal Model of Business Tourists’ Intentions of Visiting <b>Tourist</b> <b>Attractions,</b> confirming Interest in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> as a mediator in the relationship between Hotel front office staff and Business tourists’ visiting intentions. The causal model proves that there is no relationship between Hotel front office staff and Business tourists’ visiting intentions without the indirect connection with Interest in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions.</b> In support of this study’s results, Yang, Jou, and Cheng (2011) asserted that business tourists expect hotels to arrange their visits to <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions.</b> According to Kasavana and Brooks (2009), it is a duty of the hotel front office staff to arrange visits to <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions.</b> Limitations This study was limited to domestic business tourists only, thereby excluding international business tourists. A non-probability sampling method was used to select respondents; this study’s results can therefore not be generalised to the population of domestic business tourists who stay at the selected three-star hotel in Pretoria. This study’s sample was uneven in the context of gender, age, and province of residence. Future research Future studies could explore the established causal Model of Business Tourists’ Intentions of Visiting <b>Tourist</b> <b>Attractions</b> at a different hotel, to verify the validity of the model. Future studies could also explore the moderating effect of domestic business tourists with regard to age, gender, and province of residence in the relationship between Hotel front office staff and Interest in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions.</b> Future studies could further explore the causal Model of Business Tourists’ Intentions of Visiting <b>Tourist</b> <b>Attractions</b> using a different biographical segment, e. g., leisure tourists. Conclusion This study aimed to determine whether scores for Hotel front office staff related to scores for Business tourists’ visiting intentions, and how this relationship is mediated by scores on <b>Tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> scores. The Model of Business Tourists’ Intentions of Visiting <b>Tourist</b> <b>Attractions</b> confirmed that Interest in <b>tourist</b> <b>attractions</b> fully mediates the relationship between Hotel front office staff and Business tourists’ visiting intentions. Based on these results, this study’s main research objective has been achieved. Business ManagementM. Com. (Tourism Management...|$|R
