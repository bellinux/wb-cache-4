He advises one friend ("Starstruck"); [...] "you're a victim of bright city lights and your mind is not right.... running around like you're crazy... out on your feet – It's gonna drive you insane because the world's not so tame".|$|E

6000|$|... 'And no wonder,' said Lancelot; 'at all events, I {{should not}} <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> much of it. But {{it does seem}} strange that no other {{amusement}} can be found for them than the beer-shop. Can't they read? Can't they practise light and interesting handicrafts at home, as the German peasantry do?' ...|$|E

5000|$|December 17, 1846: Charles Burger {{and young}} William Murphy {{are unable to}} keep up with the snowshoers and return to the camp. Fifteen continue: five young women, nine men, and twelve-year-old Lemuel Murphy. Around this date or the next, the snowshoers get over the summit. Patrick Breen's diary: [...] "Pleasant {{sunshine}} today. Wind about S.E. Bill Murp returned from the mountain party last evening. Bealis died night before last. Milt. & Noah went to Donners 8 days since; not returned yet; <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> lost in the snow. J Denton here to day." ...|$|R
2500|$|When asked, Mr Mortimer replied with, [...] "We have no complaints, {{they did}} a great job for us. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> should have <b>got</b> {{themselves}} involved a lot earlier than they did but bottom line is <b>they</b> <b>got</b> there and we're out." ...|$|R

6000|$|The room in {{the hotel}} where the general {{meetings}} of [...] "The Island Navigation Company" [...] were held was nearly full when the secretary {{came through the door}} which as yet divided the shareholders from their directors. Having surveyed their empty chairs, their ink and papers, and nodded to a shareholder or two, he stood, watch in hand, contemplating the congregation. A thicker attendance than he had ever seen! Due, no doubt, to the lower dividend, and this Pillin business. And his tongue curled. For if he had a natural contempt for his Board, {{with the exception of the}} chairman, he had a still more natural contempt for his shareholders. Amusing spectacle when you came to think of it, a general meeting! Unique! Eighty or a hundred men, and five women, assembled through sheer devotion to their money. Was any other function in the world so single-hearted. Church was nothing to it--so many motives were mingled there with devotion to one's soul. A well-educated young man--reader of Anatole France, and other writers--he enjoyed ironic speculation. What earthly good did they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> by coming here? Half-past two! He put his watch back into his pocket, and passed into the Board-room.|$|E

40|$|A {{division}} of a cake by n people is envy free if everyone <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> the biggest pieces. Note that peoples tastes can differ. There is a discrete protocol for envy free division for n= 3 which takes at most 5 cuts. For n= 4 and beyond {{there is a}} protocol {{but the number of}} cuts it takes is unbounded. In particular the number of cuts depends on peoples tastes. Given any number N peoples tastes can be set so that the algorithm takes over N cuts. There are three such algorithms known. Which is better? We have devised a way to measure the number of cuts even though it is unbounded. We use ordinals; therefore, a statement like "this protocol takes at most 2 omega steps" makes sense. We analyse all three discrete algorithms for envy free cake cutting with this measure...|$|R

50|$|Beiimaan Love {{released}} on 14 October 2016. The film was not promoted by Sunny {{and her husband}} Daniel Weber and Chaudhari claims {{that it was because}} he refused to chop off her intimate scenes in the film. “The duo is going through a psychological fear and box-office phobia. Sunny’s previous outings have not fared well. After seeing the rough cut, they wanted me to chop off intimate scenes between the actress and Rajneesh. Daniel claimed that he had contributed his bit by revamping Sunny’s films on the editing table. But I did not like his interference and requested them to avoid doing so. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> upset with my decision,” Chaudhari told Mid-Day.|$|E

5000|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Big Sky" [...] tell about how [...] "big sky {{looked down on}} all the people {{looking up at the}} big sky," [...] and how [...] "big sky looked down on all the people who <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> {{problems}} ... but big sky is too big to sympathize." [...] Ray Davies originally came up with the song at a hotel in Cannes. Davies said, [...] "I spent an evening with all these people doing deals. The next morning at the Carlton Hotel I watched the sun come up and I looked at them all down there, all going out to do their deals. That's where I got the [...] "Big sky looking down on all the people" [...] line. It started from there." [...] At one point, Davies was asked whether the [...] "Big sky" [...] was God, he refused to give a clear answer.|$|E
5000|$|A later {{interview}} with Running With Scissors employee Jon Merchant further clarified the situation, with him stating that [...] "Akella had vastly more resources {{than we had}} for Postal 2, so it seemed reasonable {{at the time they}} could produce a game that was at least equal to the game we made inhouse. Things started out well but I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> hit pretty hard by the economic problems of 2007-8, and it all started to go downhill from there. The final product was very far removed from our original design, and horribly broken." [...] He also commented that [...] "the game is a broken mess and should not be sold. We stopped selling the game ourselves some time ago when it became apparent that neither us or the community would get the SDK tools. We don't regard it as the third POSTAL game, just a dodgy spin off that should never have happened." ...|$|E
3000|$|On this question, {{instructor}} M {{showed a}} steady progression from an instructive {{view on the}} pre-course interview to a reform-based view on the final post-course interview. Her initial view focused on students being able to repeat presented information: “I try to ask questions in the lecture and if they can’t answer the questions I figure they’re not getting it…I guess ultimately it’s how they do on the test.” By post-course, she expressed a reform-based view: “…different applications of the basic concept. When they can do that, when they can take the concept and apply it in novel situations, I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> it.” [...]...|$|E

I can't tell secrets, but I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> have <b>got</b> a very clever little finale {{for the first}} part--a pretty {{compliment}} to one person and a pleasant surprise to all," [...] answered Mr. Burton, who was in great spirits, being fond of theatricals and very justly proud of his children, for the little girls had been among the Trenton maids, and the mimic General had kissed his own small sister, Nelly, very tenderly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{is their}} chance," [...] Edwards agreed; [...] "but I don't {{believe in their}} attacking. I can't <b>think</b> who <b>they</b> have <b>got</b> in command.

500|$|The {{final scene}} of the episode ended with a tape of a young Olivia in a fire-damaged room, leading to rumors her {{character}} was a fire starter. Torv however discounted this soon after, explaining [...] "I think it's more than that... I <b>think</b> what <b>they</b> <b>got</b> given or what <b>they</b> <b>got</b> taught is much bigger than just starting fire". Jeff Pinkner agreed and elaborated further, [...] "We saw the consequence. We saw that she started a fire {{at the end of}} the last episode, but I think it's a mistake to assume that that's her power. I think the truth is, it's probably a consequence of her ability". This particular scene, as well as the episode's reference to experiments Walter performed on children, comprise the main plot of the season three episode [...] "Subject 13".|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{soon as we}} <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> have <b>got</b> to {{the edge}} of the trees we will throw a {{fireball}} out in that direction, and then let them have it. We must keep them from getting closer if we can; when they once get near the foot of the palisade we shall not be able to depress our guns enough to fire upon them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, if {{you make}} a howling mistake," [...] Collins told them, [...] "that's when you all pull the wires like mad and poke the leader and whirl him around.

5000|$|She continued, [...] "Im {{demanding}} an urgent {{meeting with the}} producers of Hollyoaks over this. It seems they have already recorded these episodes so <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> have <b>got</b> away with it. But I want to look {{them in the eye}} and hear them explain how they can justify it. I want to know how they could stoop so low as to broadcast such a horrible insult to the memory of my beautiful son. The [...] "only" [...] reason Hollyoaks is doing this is their own self-interest - to get viewers.
