5000|$|Long-term {{administration}} of the combination product of <b>terpin</b> <b>hydrate</b> with codeine may lead to codeine dependence. <b>Terpin</b> <b>hydrate</b> with codeine is often mixed with alcohol as codeine is not as readily as soluble in water. The high alcohol content (42 percent) may increase depression of the central nervous system, codeine metabolism, as well as abuse potential.|$|E

50|$|Terpin, used {{in form of}} <b>terpin</b> <b>hydrate</b> (terpin·H2O), is an expectorant, used {{to loosen}} mucus in {{patients}} presenting with acute or chronic bronchitis, and related conditions. It is derived from sources such as oil of turpentine, oregano, thyme and eucalyptus. It was popular in the United States since the late nineteenth century, but was removed from marketed medications in the 1990s after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found a lack of evidence of effectiveness. Elixirs of <b>terpin</b> <b>hydrate</b> are still available with a prescription, but must be prepared by a compounding pharmacy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Terpin</b> <b>hydrate</b> {{was first}} physiologically {{investigated}} by Lépine in 1855. He {{reported that it}} acted upon the mucous membranes and also the nervous system {{in a manner similar}} to the oil of turpentine.|$|E
50|$|A {{humectant}} and expectorant, <b>terpin</b> <b>hydrate</b> works {{directly on}} the bronchial secretory cells in the lower respiratory tract to liquify and facilitate the elimination of bronchial secretions. It also exerts a weak antiseptic effect on the pulmonary parenchyma.|$|E
50|$|<b>Terpin</b> <b>hydrate</b> is an expectorant, {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of acute and chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infectious and inflammatory diseases of the upper respiratory tract. It is typically formulated with an antitussive (e.g., codeine) as a combined preparation.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{guaifenesin}} (glyceryl guaiacolate) is {{the only}} FDA approved expectorant in the United States. Besides <b>terpin</b> <b>hydrate,</b> other expectorants lacking evidence of efficacy include ammonium chloride, beechwood creosote, benzoin preparations, camphor, eucalyptol/eucalyptus oil, iodines, ipecac syrup, menthol/peppermint oil, pine tar preparations, potassium guaiacolsulfonate, sodium citrate, squill preparations, tolu and turpentine oil.|$|E
50|$|The four-membered ring in α-pinene 1 {{makes it}} a {{reactive}} hydrocarbon, prone to skeletal rearrangements such as the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. For example, attempts to perform hydration or hydrogen halide addition with the alkene functionality typically lead to rearranged products. With concentrated sulfuric acid and ethanol the major products are terpineol 2 and its ethyl ether 3, while glacial acetic acid gives the corresponding acetate ester 4. With dilute acids, <b>terpin</b> <b>hydrate</b> 5 becomes the major product.|$|E
50|$|Allen’s {{disappointment}} following Color Blind, {{combined with}} his concomitant divorce and {{the relocation of}} his young daughter to another state, triggered a depressive disorder with which Allen would struggle {{for the remainder of}} his life. His daily use of <b>terpin</b> <b>hydrate</b> elixir with codeine (until such time as it was no longer available over the counter), alcohol and tobacco exacerbated his mental condition and compromised his physical health. Allen performed onstage throughout the Houston area up until his death from pneumonia in 1985 at the age of forty-three.|$|E
40|$|A brevibacterium, strain TH- 4, {{previously}} isolated by aerobic enrichment on the monocyclic monoterpenoid cis-terpin hydrate as a sole {{carbon and}} energy source, {{was found to}} grow on α-terpineol and {{on a number of}} common sugars and organic acids. Oxidation of these terpenoids was shown to occur via an induced enzyme system, as measured manometrically by oxygen uptake and prevention of protein synthesis with chloramphenicol or puromycin. Oxidation of <b>terpin</b> <b>hydrate</b> by cell suspensions appeared to be coincidentally induced by growth on α-terpineol, and oxidation of α-terpineol similarly appeared to be induced by growth on <b>terpin</b> <b>hydrate.</b> Culture fluids in which the TH- 4 organism was grown at the expense of cis-terpin hydrate were found to contain (−) -α-terpineol in combined butanol-ether extracts. The isolated compound was shown to be chromatographically and spectrophotometrically identical to an authentic sample of α-terpineol. The stereospecificity of an enzymatic dehydration of <b>terpin</b> <b>hydrate</b> to α-terpineol is considered...|$|E
