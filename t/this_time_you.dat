500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1901, You was {{employed}} as a cannery worker and living in Bay Center. [...] While playing cards on August 6 of that year, he was assaulted, threatened, and robbed by Oscar Bloom, a white man with {{a reputation as a}} bully. [...] <b>This</b> <b>time</b> <b>You</b> did not approach the police, but instead immediately took matters into his own hands: he went to his room to retrieve his gun, sought out and shot Bloom in the abdomen, and then fled the scene. [...] Bloom survived long enough to swear a deathbed affidavit identifying You as his killer.|$|E
500|$|Charles Aaron from Spin {{described}} the song as [...] "slinking through [...] low-ridin', gum-smackin' groove, Maddy's hard-bitten ingenue expresses no regrets, but <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> feel for her." [...] Aaron highlighted the lyrics [...] "Would it sound better if I were a man?" [...] as subversive and coy. Author Lucy O'Brien described in her book, , that [...] "Human Nature" [...] {{was one of}} the [...] "quirkiest" [...] tracks on Bedtime Stories, [...] "throbbing with a tightly restrained but devastating anger". For Barry Walters from Moscow-Pullman Daily News, the song had the catchiest chorus among all the other tracks from the album. Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly gave the song a negative review, noting that Madonna's [...] "on far surer ground thrashing through such neurotic (if not uncommon) views of relationships than she is trashing the media. In striking back at her critics, Madonna simply sounds self-righteous and smug. 'I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex,' she sneers in 'Human Nature'. 'Did I say something true?' Yes. But tooting your own horn about it just sounds petty". Rooksby said that the repetition of the sample was [...] "wearing" [...] and it [...] "did not suggest that the world of the singer was very appealing".|$|E
2500|$|After the book's publication, Jackson {{wrote to}} Dickinson, [...] "I suppose by <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> {{have seen the}} Masque of Poets. I hope you have not regretted giving me that choice bit of verse for it." [...] Jackson also {{published}} {{a review of the}} book, singling out [...] "Success" [...] as [...] "undoubtedly one of the strongest and finest wrought things in the book", before noting conjecture on the poem's authorship would be worthless. Dickinson thanked the publisher Thomas Niles for including her poem, to which he responded somewhat apologetically: [...] "you have doubtless perceived [...] was slightly changed in phraseology." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, Schwarz {{appealed to}} the National Party and its leader to reconsider a bill that would, in the PFP’s view, heavily {{restrict}} press freedom. He urged the Prime Minister: “I make this appeal to Mr Botha: Show this statesmanship, show that at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> will not allow our unity of purpose to overcome the real problems to be threatened.” [...] In 1980, the National Party introduced the National Key Points Act that made those responsible for unauthorised reporting of incidents of sabotage or other attacks on declared national strategic targets a criminal. Schwarz slammed the attempts to restrict press freedoms, and stated that [...] "Society {{as a whole is}} not condemned because individuals transgress, and nor should the press as a whole be judges by the actions of individuals." [...] Stating that press restrictions marked a [...] "turning point" [...] in South African politics, he also argued that press freedom was a [...] "precious treasure" [...] and a free and courageous press was a major weapon in South Africa's defence against external threats.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a period}} of rapid {{linguistic}} change the translators avoided contemporary idioms, tending instead towards forms that were already slightly archaic, like verily and it came to pass. The pronouns thou/thee and ye/you are consistently used as singular and plural respectively, even though by <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> was often found as the singular in general English usage, especially when addressing a social superior (as is evidenced, for example, in Shakespeare). [...] For the possessive of the third person pronoun, the word its, first recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1598, is avoided. The older his is usually employed, as for example at : [...] "if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted?"; in other places of it, thereof or bare it are found. Another sign of linguistic conservativism is the invariable use of -eth for the third person singular present form of the verb, as at Matthew 2:13: [...] "the Angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dreame". The rival ending -(e)s, as found in present-day English, was already widely used by this time (for example, it predominates over -eth in the plays of Shakespeare and Marlowe). Furthermore, the translators preferred which to who or whom as the relative pronoun for persons, as in : [...] "And Lot also which went with Abram, had flocks and heards, & tents" [...] although who(m) is also found.|$|E
