40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} isolated, initially non-axisymmetric vortices in <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>flows</b> tend to become axisymmetric, in a coarse-grained sense, by purely inviscid mechanisms. That research, however, considered only vortices with broadly distributed vorticity. In this paper, it is shown that vortices with sufficiently steep edge gradients behave in a radically different way; in particular they can remain non-axisymmetric, apparently indefinitely. Such vortices, it is argued, are more typical in inviscid <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>flows</b> than the broadly distributed vortices previously considered, and hence the tendency for vortices to become axisymmetric is not generic to these flows...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} lateral {{streamline}} convergence {{alone on the}} transitional flow characteristics has been studied towards modelling the transition zone.

5000|$|There is more {{downward}} {{turning of}} the flow than there {{would be in a}} <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>flow</b> with the same airfoil shape and sectional lift, and a higher sectional angle of attack is required to achieve the same lift compared to a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>flow.</b> [...] The wing is effectively flying in a downdraft of its own making, as if the freestream flow were tilted downward, with the result that the total aerodynamic force vector is tilted backward slightly compared to what it would be in two dimensions. The additional backward component of the force vector is called lift-induced drag.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} prove, that the {{projection}} method {{will lead to}} the same solution as the direct insertion, the EASM for <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>flows</b> is derived. In <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>flows</b> only the tensors are independent.The projection leads then to the same coefficients. This two-dimensional EASM is used as starting point for an optimized EASM which includes three-dimensional effects. For example the shear stress variation in a rotating pipe cannot be predicted with quadratic tensors. Hence, the EASM was extended with a cubic tensor. In order to do not affect the performance in 2D flows, a tensor was chosen that vanish in 2d flows. This offers the concentration of the coefficient determination in 3d flows. A cubic tensor, which vanishes in 3d flow is: The projection with tensors T(1), T(2), T(3) and T(5) yields then the coefficients of the EASM.|$|R

50|$|According to the {{equations}} below, a wing of infinite aspect ratio (wingspan/chord length) and constant airfoil section would produce no induced drag. The characteristics {{of such a}} wing can be measured on a section of wing spanning {{the width of a}} wind tunnel, since the walls block spanwise flow and create what is effectively <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|E
50|$|For a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>flow,</b> the {{vorticity}} acts as {{a measure}} of the local rotation of fluid elements. Note that the vorticity does not imply anything about the global behavior of a fluid. It is possible for a fluid traveling in a straight line to have vorticity, and it is possible for a fluid that moves in a circle to be irrotational.|$|E
50|$|In physics, Green's theorem {{is mostly}} used to solve <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>flow</b> integrals, {{stating that the}} sum of fluid {{outflows}} from a volume {{is equal to the}} total outflow summed about an enclosing area.

50|$|For {{wings of}} moderate-to-high aspect ratio, the flow at any station along the span except {{close to the}} tips behaves much like flow around a {{two-dimensional}} airfoil, and most explanations of lift, like those above, concentrate on <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>flow.</b> However, even for wings of high aspect ratio, the three-dimensional effects associated with finite span are significant across the whole span, not just close to the tips.|$|E
5000|$|When the {{particle}} velocities are constrained to be parallel to a fixed plane, one can ignore the space dimension perpendicular to that plane, and model the flow as a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>flow</b> velocity field on that plane. Then the vorticity vector [...] is always perpendicular to that plane, {{and can be}} treated as a scalar. This assumption is sometimes made in meteorology, when studying large-scale phenomena like hurricanes.|$|E
50|$|Thin airfoil {{theory is}} a simple theory of {{airfoils}} that relates angle of attack to lift for incompressible, inviscid flows. It was devised by German-American mathematician Max Munk and further refined by British aerodynamicist Hermann Glauert {{and others in the}} 1920s. The theory idealizes the flow around an airfoil as <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>flow</b> around a thin airfoil. It can be imagined as addressing an airfoil of zero thickness and infinite wingspan.|$|E
40|$|While more {{rigorous}} and sophisticated methods for identifying Lagrangian based coherent structures exist, the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field remains a straightforward and popular method for gaining {{some insight into}} transport by complex, time-dependent <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>flows.</b> In light of its enduring appeal, and in support of good practice, we begin by investigating the effects of discretization and noise on two numerical approaches for calculating the FTLE field. A practical method to extract and refine FTLE ridges in <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>flows,</b> which builds on previous methods, is then presented. Seeking to better ascertain {{the role of an}} FTLE ridge in flow transport, we adapt an existing classification scheme and provide a thorough treatment of the challenges of classifying the types of deformation represented by an FTLE ridge. As a practical demonstration, the methods are applied to an ocean surface velocity field data set generated by a numerical model. Comment: 32 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
