5|$|I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> plant a few acorns, and I {{have lived}} to see one or two trees growing: gay rights, freedom of information, CND. I'm not {{claiming}} them for myself but you feel you have encouraged other people and see the arguments developing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Adela, you do; I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> I think I am {{honest and}} open. At any rate, I {{strive to be}} so. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{understand}} me." ...|$|E
60|$|FAITH. But I {{am ready}} to <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> but jest, because you smiled.|$|E
60|$|AND because <b>you</b> love me <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not hate me? Ha, {{since you}} love me to ecstasy it follows you hate me to ecstasy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{right to}} sell to him," [...] said Westover, saddened {{somewhat}} by the proof Whitwell alleged of his magnanimity.|$|R
6000|$|Prosp. How can I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{remember}} hers, [...] When {{you forgot}} your own? <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not see [...] The man, whom I commanded you to shun? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "D'you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{make enough}} {{allowance}} for feelings?" [...] asked Mr. Hewet. He had again forgotten {{what he had}} meant to say.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> and {{sometimes}} I think you don't. Anyway, you don't know your fellow-woman. There was that affair of the Spaniards." ...|$|E
60|$|A.--Well, however unjust {{you are to}} me, and to my {{neighbour}} too, I {{will not}} undeceive you at present; I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not deserve it.|$|E
6000|$|... "My brother <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> He {{heard the}} whole story. It was brave and noble of you, it was indeed!" [...] And Vera's face showed her earnestness.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no, we {{will not}} have any crying this evening,' said Claude. 'I <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> me much mischief, my head ached just as much before.' ...|$|R
60|$|BENTLEY. I should <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> Johnny {{was rather}} rough on me, though. He told me nobody here liked me; and I was silly {{enough to believe}} him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes you do, I think. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Come, come, Lady Dedlock, we {{must not}} fence and parry now. You know you like this girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> Papa. I {{think he}} {{intended}} no personal disrespect {{to you when}} he preached the sermon which made the archdeacon and the dean so angry!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> him wrong, mamma. I am {{sure you}} are doing me wrong. I think his coming was an accident, and that what he said was--an accident.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> But {{that has}} nothing to do with the present situation. I want to know if you are willing to come to terms or not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> a good deal," [...] and Barton Pelter laughed nervously. [...] "You-- {{you are now}} in {{business}} where my uncle used to be, are you not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] Kit said, laughing, [...] "you're {{generally}} frank. I'd {{rather have}} liked to <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{want to see me}} off. Anyhow, I'm glad you have arrived." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{say that}} again I shall <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it on purpose!" [...] Delia declared. [...] "ARE you {{thinking}} of George Flack?" [...] she repeated in a moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon-my word, my love, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> Mrs. Crawley injustice," [...] Sir Pitt said; {{at which}} speech Rebecca was vastly relieved. [...] "Indeed I believe her to be--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{she said}} reflectively, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> It doesn't matter who she is, anyway, and you haven't {{told me what}} you think of Mr. Sewell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't {{suppose that}} we've ever said {{anything}} to Miss Ruth, or that we're goin' to. It's a great deal better to let her <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> it all yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am so of often going there. He {{had spoken}} to me before about this. He <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not like him to come here, and you never go there yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{had better}} listen to me, my dear. I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> quite {{understand}} it. It {{would have been}} very odd if you had, as I never explained it to you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I'm {{pleased to}} have you throw the judge over, and employ me, but, all the same, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> him an injustice. He's a good, square man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{wrong in}} {{shutting}} yourself {{away from all}} human comradeship,' she said, with that good-humoured smile of hers. 'You must know that you will only grow absurdly morbid.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> Lillie injustice," [...] said Rose. [...] "There is, {{and must}} be, good in every one; and {{gradually}} {{the good in}} him will overcome the evil in her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Like what he thinks." [...] Then so gravely that it {{was almost}} a supplication, [...] "Don't tell me," [...] she added, [...] "that you don't KNOW what he <b>thinks.</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> know." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mr Schneider: What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> were {{innocent}} of? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> didnâ€™t <b>do?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> Dan. Well, I am {{too tired}} to tell you {{anything}} about it now, but I have one piece of news for you: Tony has come back to his wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her waiting eyes {{recalled}} {{him from}} his inquiry, and with an effort he answered, [...] "Yes, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> have your being here and now, Miss Gerald, to an unusual degree." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't wonder," [...] he said, [...] "if he defied you, and didn't {{send the}} herald after all. I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> know your Wayne quite so {{well as you}} think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since we know whence our late {{companion}} came," [...] she said, in an under tone, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> him wrong, however right your suspicions {{may prove}} {{as to the}} rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, let me git out!" [...] yelled Peleg Snuggers, but at {{that moment}} the snowball began to turn over. [...] "I'll be killed! Oh, dear, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> this a-purpose, <b>you</b> rascals!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you need}} not regret it," [...] said Mrs. Easterfield. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> quite enough, and if {{anything}} of the kind occurs again I positively forbid {{you to go out}} of the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Kit, [...] "I really <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> There are matters {{about which}} we do not agree; but I believe you are too kind to let a rather ignorant {{antagonist}} get hurt." ...|$|R
