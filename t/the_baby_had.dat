After Elizabeth's death, Sheridan {{fulfilled}} his promise to look after Elizabeth and FitzGerald's baby daughter. A nurse was employed {{to care for the}} child at his Wanstead home. <b>The</b> <b>baby</b> <b>had</b> a series of fits one evening in October 1793, when she was 18 months old, dying before a doctor could attend.

25|$|Season eight {{addresses}} Roseanne's baby {{shower and}} the subsequent arrival of her son, Jerry Garcia Conner. (In a continuity error, <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>had</b> been revealed {{to be a girl}} in season seven. Roseanne, in an after-credits out of character scene, explains that after she fell pregnant she wished the Conners' baby to be the same gender as hers). The season starts when Dan decides to leave the security of his city job to help build the new prison being constructed outside of Lanford. With the pension, final check, and retirement money he receives for leaving his job he decides to give his family the vacation they never had and takes everyone, including Mark, David, and Roseanne's mother, along to Walt Disney World. It is later revealed that one of the nights the clan was at Disney was also the night Darlene got pregnant. Darlene quickly decides she and David want to have the baby and the two get engaged. The season climaxes with a very rushed wedding for Darlene. Immediately after the ceremony, realizing how much has been changing, Dan suffers a heart attack. In the next episode it is revealed that he survives, as DJ saved his life. The season concludes with Dan and Roseanne having a bitter fight after Dan refuses to stick to his diet and exercise plan, rehashing many of the buried personality clashes of the entire series. They end up wrecking their living room in the process. The credits fade as Roseanne walks out on Dan. Other subjects are DJ's Thanksgiving pageant, Darlene's wedding, and Dan's heart attack.|$|E

500|$|Although Comedy Central did {{not object}} to most aspects of the episode, they did require some edits to {{material}} they deemed potentially offensive. During rehearsal for a Nativity play, a baby Jesus resembling a fetus pops out of Wendy, who is playing the Virgin Mary, and is caught by Kyle, who is portraying Joseph of Nazareth. Although the scene was ultimately kept in the episode, Comedy Central executives had problems with it and Parker said they had to handle its animation [...] "very carefully". Additionally, during filming of the live-action Mr. Hankey commercial, the baby originally held the Mr. Hankey stool and took {{a bite out of}} it. Comedy Central officials would not allow the scene in the episode and it was changed to portray the idea that <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>had</b> already eaten the stool off-camera, which Parker said he felt was actually funnier.|$|E

As he had gotten more sensitive in his older age, his owners always praised him for the gifts, which ranged from a full picnic basket to roadkill. One night, he [...] "finds" [...] a baby, who was kidnapped from a wealthy household by a disgruntled former employee and his kin. <b>The</b> <b>baby</b> <b>had</b> been set in the grass by his two kidnappers while they changed a flat tire.

500|$|His {{birthday}} (14 December 1895) was the 34th {{anniversary of}} the death of his great-grandfather, Albert, Prince Consort. Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been [...] "rather distressed". Two days later, he wrote again: [...] "I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her". Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: [...] "I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good". Consequently, he was baptised [...] "Albert Frederick Arthur George" [...] at St. Mary Magdalene's Church near Sandringham three months later. Within the family, he was known informally as [...] "Bertie". His maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Teck, did not like the first name <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>had</b> been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name [...] "may supplant the less favoured one". Albert was fourth in line to the throne at birth, after his grandfather, father and elder brother, Edward.|$|E

500|$|Longworth {{notes that}} the {{dramatic}} success of Out of Africa led to a backlash of critical opinion against Streep {{in the years that}} followed, especially as she was now demanding $4million a picture. Unlike other stars at the time such as Sylvester Stallone and Tom Cruise, Streep [...] "never seemed to play herself", and certain critics felt her technical finesse led people to literally see her acting. Her next films did not appeal to a wide audience; she co-starred with Jack Nicholson in the dramas Heartburn (1986) and Ironweed (1987), in which she sang onscreen {{for the first time since}} the television movie Secret Service (1977). In Evil Angels (1988), she played Lindy Chamberlain, an Australian woman who had been convicted of the murder of her infant daughter despite claiming that <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>had</b> been taken by a dingo. Filmed in Australia, Streep won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, a Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival, and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. Streep has said of perfecting the Australian accent in the film: [...] "I had to study a little bit for Australian because it's not dissimilar , so it's like coming from Italian to Spanish. You get a little mixed up". Vincent Canby of The New York Times referred to her performance as [...] "another stunning performance", played with [...] "the kind of virtuosity that seems to redefine the possibilities of screen acting".|$|E

To me it seemed a “murdered innocent”. And an hour or two after another child died.|$|E

2500|$|Subsequently, {{adoption}} {{laws were}} made stricter, giving local authorities {{the power to}} police baby farms {{in the hope of}} stamping out abuse. Despite this and the scrutinising of newspaper personal ads, the trafficking and abuse of infants did not stop. Two years after Dyer's execution, railway workers inspecting carriages at Newton Abbot, Devon, found a parcel. Inside was a three-week-old girl, but, though cold and wet, she was alive. The daughter of a widow, Jane Hill, <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>had</b> been given to a Mrs. Stewart, for £12. She had picked up the baby at Plymouth—and apparently dumped her on the next train.

2500|$|However, {{the report}} was called into {{question}} when it emerged that {{the timing of the}} baby's death had been misrepresented, and appeared to be an attempt by Gaza's Hamas rulers to exploit the death to gain sympathy. The Associated Press later learned that news of Mohammed Helou's death had already appeared on March 4 in the local Arabic newspaper Al-Quds and that Hamas was now trying to recycle the story to capitalize on the family's tragedy. The Al-Quds article contained the same details as the later report, but with an earlier date. When confronted by the Associated Press, the family and Hamas official Bassem al-Qadri continued to insist that <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>had</b> only recently died.

2500|$|Although race {{played a}} {{significant}} factor in Wallace's support elsewhere, his strength in Maryland came from the galvanized Eastern Shore, where some estimates put his support among whites as high as 90%. Riots in Cambridge had erupted over the repeal of an equal access law, and as the rioters clashed with the National Guard, civil rights leader Gloria Richardson led peaceful demonstrations against the measure. At the behest of aid Bill Jones, Wallace reluctantly kept a speaking engagement in Cambridge, where he was confronted by some 500 black protesters. When a baby was thought to have died from the tear gas used by police, it seemed a public relations disaster to the Wallace campaign, but the coroner's report concluded <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>had</b> died of a congenital heart defect. Opponents nonetheless attempted to use the incident and the neo-Nazi National States' Rights Party's description of Wallace as the [...] "last chance for the white voter" [...] against him, but Wallace continued to gain momentum, and The Baltimore Sun observed the distinct possibility that he would win the state.|$|E

In May 2013, Herrera Beutler {{announced}} they were expecting their first child. In June 2013, Herrera Beutler announced her unborn child {{had been diagnosed with}} Potter's Syndrome, abnormally low amniotic fluid caused by impaired kidney function which inhibits normal lung development and is often fatal. She is only the ninth woman in history to give birth while serving in the United States Congress. On July 29, 2013, it was announced that <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>had</b> been born two weeks earlier, at 28 weeks' gestation.

2500|$|According to the EastEnders Handbook by Hilary Kingsley, casting babies for {{roles in}} EastEnders is usually done locally, so that {{children}} and their parents do not have to travel far when they are called into the studios at BBC Elstree. Because of the strict laws dictating the number of hours babies are permitted to work, occasionally dolls or understudies have to be used if the child runs out of time. This occurred with Steven’s original actor, Edward Farrell, in 1990. <b>The</b> <b>baby</b> <b>had</b> been scripted to appear at a Guy Fawkes Night party; however, actress Michelle Collins, who played his screen mother Cindy, has since revealed that they used another baby for those scenes: [...] "Not only was she a girl, she also had bright red hair whereas Edward was fair. I had to keep pushing her hair back under her hat but lots of [...] still spotted it". Young Farrell was also the reason viewers never saw Cindy wearing her red wedding dress on-screen again following its next outing at Steven’s christening in February 1990. It was a dress that Michelle Collins particularly disliked. She has commented, [...] "When Edward was sick over it, I knew it wouldn’t recover and I kissed him for it." ...|$|E
