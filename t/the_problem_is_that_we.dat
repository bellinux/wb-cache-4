For instance, in the popular nonogram puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of squares to be determined represents the dark pixels in a binary image, and the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive blocks of dark pixels to include in each row or column of the image, and how long each of those blocks should be.

50|$|To {{verify the}} {{validity}} of the Debye-Hückel theory, many experimental ways have been tried, measuring the activity coefficients: <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> need to go towards very high dilutions.Typical examples are: measurements of vapour pressure, freezing point, osmotic pressure (indirect methods) and measurement of electric potential in cells (direct method).Going towards high dilutions good results have been found using liquid membrane cells, it has been possible to investigate aqueous media 10−4 M and it has been found that for 1:1 electrolytes (as NaCl or KCl) the Debye-Hückel equation is totally correct, but for 2:2 or 3:2 electrolytes it is possible to find negative deviation from the Debye-Hückel limit law: this strange behavior can be observed only in the very dilute area, and in more concentrate regions the deviation becomes positive.It is possible that Debye-Hückel equation is not able to foresee this behavior because of the linearization of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, or maybe not: studies about this have been started only during the last years of the 20th century because before it wasn’t possible to investigate the 10−4 M region, so it is possible that during the next years new theories will be born.|$|E

[...] Sarita A Tanwar of Daily News & Analysis gave it 2.5 stars and described the film as [...] "stretched" [...] and [...] "cheesy" [...] but also called it [...] "a daring film" [...] while interpreting it as [...] "The best thing about the film is that it questions gender roles that we impose on ourselves and each other. But, the film loses momentum mid-way. The idea is stretched too thin and the climax is cheesy. It's enjoyable when it's not trite. You might take to it if you are the sort that enjoys clichés." [...] Pallavi Patra from Zee News gave it 2 stars and mentioned it as [...] "trite enterprise" [...] while summarizing the film as [...] "Ki & Ka is a seemingly funny enterprise with a feminist theme gone awry. It's not the theme that is at trouble here but a laid-back script coupled with an ostensibly manufactured chemistry between its promising leads. Watch it or not, Ki & Ka prefix will enjoy its dominance over the youth - but cinematic wise - not a good picture here" [...] Saibal Chatterjee from NDTV gave the film 2 stars and called it [...] "intermittently watchable". He noted, [...] "A concept film that has a lot to say - Ki And Ka actually succeeds in getting a few of its points in edgewise - but the writing is below-par. As a consequence, Ki And Ka is like a string of patched-together monosyllables that never attain sustained coherence. Too much talk and very little plot progression put the skids under the film. Ki And Ka goes belly up pretty quickly never to recover fully." [...] Ananya Bhattacharya of India Today gave a low rating of 1.5 and summarized it as [...] "good germs of film spoilt by bad execution" [...] and mentioned, [...] "he film tries so hard to be what it is not that it loses way badly. The writing is not a field which Ki And Ka excels in. The film, for most part, feels like a rehearsal of sorts. Both Arjun and Kareena look like they are mouthing sharp, one-tone dialogues to impress the conductor of this out-of-tune opera that is Ki And Ka. The ping-pong dialogue-delivery between Arjun and Kareena is a major dampener." [...] Anna M.M. Vetticad from Firstpost also criticised the film as [...] "fun concept spoilt by patchy plot" [...] while stating [...] "Large swathes of Ki & Ka are fun, considerable sections of it are unexpectedly broad-minded, path-breaking for Bollywood and insightful. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can section it off in this fashion.
