It was all published in the papers and somebody let the cat out of the bag and anyhow the government and the judges in those times they realised what the trouble was and the whole thing was hushed up you see.|$|E
25|$|After Super Tuesday {{all five}} territories had their contests. Puerto Rico held a primary {{and the four}} smaller insular areas (Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and U.S. Virgin Islands) had {{convention}} style caucuses where no straw polls were taken, therefore our table does not show popular vote percentages in these rows {{but the number of}} delegates committed to each candidate. Romney secured all but two delegates from the territories. Of the six selected delegates from the Virgin Islands, one was elected as uncommitted, and another bound to Paul. On the Virgin Islands every caucus goer had six votes that he or her could cast for six different delegates. Every person wanting to be a delegate needed to pledge to a candidate or declare to be 'uncommitted' before the voting started. The six persons with the most votes became National Convention delegates. Only four persons ran as delegates pledge to Romney and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>got</b> elected. The persons that ran as delegates pledge to Paul got a plurality of the votes, but only one of them was elected.|$|E

500|$|Many of the {{conflicts}} and political dimensions of Star Trek represent allegories of contemporary cultural realities. Star Trek: The Original Series addressed {{issues of the}} 1960s, just as later spin-offs have reflected issues of their respective decades. Issues depicted in the various series include war and peace, the value of personal loyalty, authoritarianism, imperialism, class warfare, economics, racism, religion, human rights, sexism, feminism, {{and the role of}} technology. Roddenberry stated: [...] " [...] a new world with new rules, I could make statements about sex, religion, Vietnam, politics, and intercontinental missiles. Indeed, we did make them on Star Trek: we were sending messages and fortunately <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>got</b> by the network." [...] "If you talked about purple people on a far off planet, they (the TV network) never really caught on. They were more concerned about cleavage. They actually would send a censor down to the set to measure a woman's cleavage to make sure too much of her breast wasn't showing" ...|$|E
500|$|... funk, bubblegum R and pop rock track. Ken Tucker of NPR {{found it}} hard to {{categorize}} the recording. Its instrumentation includes 60's soul finger snaps, police sirens, hand claps and [...] "scratchy guitarlines". According to the digital sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing, the song was composed in the key of E minor with a tempo of 144 beats per minute. Mars' vocals range spans from the low note of G4 to the high note of B5. Jon Caramanica from The New York Times felt that Mars was trying to [...] "channel" [...] Little Richard and called the track [...] "jumpy" [...] and [...] "salacious". Lyrically, [...] "Runaway Baby" [...] conveys the message for women to avoid Mars since he is willing to break their hearts due to being a playboy and a [...] "rolling stone" [...] ("Lord knows I'm a rolling stone"). Moreover, there is a comparison established between Mars' penis and a carrot, [...] "So many eager young bunnies...and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>got</b> to share it." ...|$|E
500|$|As Key and Mosely {{stayed in}} New York, they {{admitted}} {{that there was}} a delay when it came to start writing songs for the album. Key, however, did explain that they were writing [...] "weird, obscure, not-too-mellow" [...] tracks and working on notebooks that he compiled while the band was touring. He also noted {{that he was able to}} write for a couple of hours and would receive over [...] "15-20 ideas" [...] that he could take out for the band, so once <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>got</b> together, they can start collaborating on the record. Mosely, also in discussion of this, added that the reason it took them so long was because they were [...] "scared to death" [...] with the writing. Mosely concluded that once the writing had begun, the process was easier on them. It was also during this time that Key and Mosely began to turn their apartment into a studio, adding a drum kit, guitar amps, and even including a piano. While Key and Mosely began the development of the songs, the rest of the members would occasionally fly to New York to check on the progress.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the series}} finale the regular {{characters}} are {{held hostage in}} the house by a fugitive bank robber. The robber places a bomb in the family's VCR, as leverage with the police. After the hostage drama has been resolved and the robber arrested the family remembers there's a bomb in the VCR, but they don't know how to re-program it. Betty observes that [...] "this is just like E Street... at the end, where <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>got</b> blown up", but Greg responds that [...] "That doesn't happen in sitcoms." [...] (Greg's portrayer Mark Owen-Taylor had acted in E Street.) The characters panic as they count down the seconds to the expected explosion and the screen fades to black. The cast are then shown in a curtain call as the credits roll. The curtain call includes former regular cast members Christopher Truswell and Sarah Monahan who do not otherwise appear in the episode, series producer and writer Gary Reilly and writer John Flanagan.|$|E
2500|$|After a time {{living in}} one of the {{imperial}} residences in the Crimea, she received reports that her sons, her daughter-in-law and her grandchildren had been murdered. However, she publicly rejected the report as a rumour. On the day after the murder of the Tsar's family, Maria received a messenger from Nicky, [...] "a touching man" [...] who told how difficult was the life of her son's family in Yekaterinburg. [...] "And nobody can help or liberate them - only God! My Lord save my poor, unlucky Nicky, help him in his hard ordeals!" [...] In her diary she comforted herself: [...] "I am sure <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>got</b> out of Russia and now the Bolsheviks are trying to hide the truth." [...] She firmly held on to this conviction until her death. The truth was too painful for her to admit publicly. Her letters to her son and his family have since almost all been lost; but in one that survives, she wrote to Nicholas: [...] "You know that my thoughts and prayers never leave you. I think of you day and night and sometimes feel so sick at heart that I believe I cannot bear it any longer. But God is merciful. He will give us strength for this terrible ordeal." [...] Maria's daughter Olga Alexandrovna commented further on the matter, [...] "Yet I am sure that deep in her heart my mother had steeled herself to accept the truth some years before her death." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, DeVille made Victory Mixture, {{a tribute}} album of classic New Orleans soul and R which he {{recorded}} {{with some of}} the songs' original composers. The album was recorded without the use of overdubbing or sound editing with the goal of capturing the spirit of the original recordings.I got all the original guys to come back in, like Earl King, Dr. John and Eddie Bo. Allen Toussaint played side piano. I brought in the rhythm section of The Meters on a couple of cuts. We call it the [...] "little" [...] record. It's funny, because I was just trying to get them money, the writers of the songs, 'cause <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>got</b> ripped off in the 1950s and 1960s. They were all fascinated, and Dr. John (who had played on DeVille's 1978 album Return to Magenta and who DeVille knew from his association with Doc Pomus) convinced them that they wouldn't get ripped off by this northern white boy. That's when I crossed over to being a local here in New Orleans. We were all pleased with it. It's recorded the way it was originally done back then. It's live with no overdubs anywhere, no digital, no editing. We played the song several times and just picked the best take, the one that was the most natural. It's on Fnac/Orleans Records. I'm really proud of that one. Victory Mixture was recorded for a small independent label, Orleans Records, which licensed it to Sky Ranch (Fnac Music) in France. [...] "It sold over 100,000 units in Europe very quicklyour first gold disc," [...] said Carlo Ditta, founder of Orleans Records and the producer of Victory Mixture.|$|E
2500|$|The {{presentation}} of candidates {{on national television}} is customarily a contentious issue, with minor candidates complaining of lack of coverage and the major candidates complaining about dilution of campaign on fringe issues. Croatian Radiotelevision, as the public television operator, is legally obliged to give each candidate equal airtime, and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>got</b> a half-hour interview in the late prime-time political show [...] "Otvoreno". There were three televised debates held in the first round. The first was held on 20 November on HRT with 10 candidates present. Andrija Hebrang and Boris Mikšić refused to attend claiming they were discriminated on all national television networks. The second was held on 10 December on Nova TV hosted by Mislav Bago. Five candidates that were ahead in the polls were present, Ivo Josipović, Nadan Vidošević, Andrija Hebrang, Dragan Primorac and Vesna Pusić. Milan Bandić refused to attend. The main topics were the fight against corruption, {{the economy and the}} European Union. A poll conducted after the debate showed Vesna Pusić won the debate with 30% of those polled responding she did best, with Ivo Josipović coming in second with 26%. The poll also showed Ivo Josipović was the most specific in his answers with Vesna Pusić following closely. The audience considered Nadan Vidošević the most likable and Andrija Hebrang the most entertaining. The final debate was once again held on HRT on 22 December and was the only one with all 12 candidates present. The main topics of discussion were campaign spending, corruption and the suggestion of removing political immunity. There were four debates planned with the final one to be held on Nova TV on 23 December with six major candidates to be present. However, the six candidates behind in the polls objected saying they were discriminated by Nova TV, particularly Josip Jurčević who threatened to sue the television station and filed a complaint against it to the country's electoral commission. Finally, Nova TV canceled the scheduled debate and called for the change of Croatia's laws concerning media coverage of presidential campaigns.|$|E
