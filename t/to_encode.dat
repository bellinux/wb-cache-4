5000|$|In the PalmDoc format, a length-distance pair {{is always}} encoded by a two-byte sequence.

5|$|Path {{integration}} in mammals {{makes use of}} the vestibular organs, which detect accelerations in the three dimensions, together with motor efference, where the motor system tells {{the rest of the}} brain which movements were commanded, and optic flow, where the visual system signals how fast the visual world moves past the eyes. Information from other senses such as echolocation and magnetoreception may also be integrated in certain animals. The hippocampus is {{the part of the brain}} that integrates linear and angular motion <b>to</b> <b>encode</b> a mammal's relative position in space.|$|E
5|$|Surprisingly, {{variations}} {{in the interpretation of}} the genetic code exist also in human nuclear-encoded genes: In 2016, researchers studying the translation of malate dehydrogenase found that in about 4% of the mRNAs encoding this enzyme the stop codon is naturally used <b>to</b> <b>encode</b> the amino acids tryptophan and arginine. This type of recoding is induced by a high-readthrough stop codon context and it is referred to as functional translational readthrough.|$|E

5|$|Bezen Perrot enacted {{operations}} in January 1944. It was initially employed on guard and surveillance duty around German installations. It {{took part in}} the arrests of Jews, Service du travail obligatoire evaders and resistance fighters. Their knowledge of the Breton language proved to be a prized possession, enabling the German authorities to intercept arms drops and infiltrate Breton resistance networks who used it <b>to</b> <b>encode</b> their communications. In March, their civilian clothing was replaced with the uniforms of Waffen-SS, lacking any Breton insignia and they were armed with submachine guns, operating in conjunction with the French collaborationist Selbstschutz Polizei.|$|E
5|$|Further, birds {{recall and}} avoid {{objects that are}} both {{conspicuous}} and foul-tasting longer than objects that are equally foul-tasting but cryptically coloured. This suggests that Wallace's original view, that warning colouration helped to teach predators to avoid prey thus coloured, was correct. However, some birds (inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks) also innately avoid conspicuously coloured objects, as demonstrated using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps, with dull green controls. This implies that warning coloration works {{at least in part}} by stimulating the evolution of predators <b>to</b> <b>encode</b> the meaning of the warning signal, rather than by requiring each new generation to learn the signal's meaning.|$|E
5|$|In a paper {{published}} in Nature in January 2013, {{scientists from the}} European Bioinformatics Institute and Agilent Technologies proposed a mechanism to use DNA's ability to code information {{as a means of}} digital data storage. The group was able <b>to</b> <b>encode</b> 739 kilobytes of data into DNA code, synthesize the actual DNA, then sequence the DNA and decode the information back to its original form, with a reported 100% accuracy. The encoded information consisted of text files and audio files. A prior experiment was {{published in}} August 2012. It was conducted by researchers at Harvard University, where the text of a 54,000-word book was encoded in DNA.|$|E

5|$|In works where elves are {{the main}} characters, such as The Silmarillion or Wendy and Richard Pini’s comic book series Elfquest, elves exhibit a similar range of {{behaviour}} to a human cast, distinguished largely by their superhuman physical powers. However, where narratives are more human-centered, as in The Lord of the Rings, elves tend to sustain their role as powerful, sometimes threatening, outsiders. Despite the obvious fictionality of fantasy novels and games, scholars have found that elves in these works {{continue to have a}} subtle role in shaping the real-life identities of their audiences. For example, elves can function <b>to</b> <b>encode</b> real-world racial others in video games, or to influence gender-norms through literature.|$|E
5|$|The Prince of Egypt was {{released}} on DVD and VHS on September 14, 1999. The ownership of the film was assumed by DreamWorks Animation when that company split from DreamWorks Pictures in 2004; (As of 2017, {{the rights to the}} film are now owned by Universal Studios via its acquisition of DWA.) as {{with the rest of the}} DreamWorks Animation catalog, it is available for streaming on Netflix in HD. However, both the DVD release and the streaming versions used a 35mm print of the film, rather than using the original files <b>to</b> <b>encode</b> the movie directly to digital.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-two {{amino acids}} are {{naturally}} incorporated into polypeptides and are called proteinogenic or natural amino acids. Of these, 20 are encoded by the universal genetic code. The remaining 2, selenocysteine and pyrrolysine, {{are incorporated into}} proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms. Selenocysteine is incorporated when the mRNA being translated includes a SECIS element, which causes the UGA codon <b>to</b> <b>encode</b> selenocysteine instead of a stop codon. Pyrrolysine is used by some methanogenic archaea in enzymes that they use to produce methane. It is coded for with the codon UAG, which is normally a stop codon in other organisms. This UAG codon {{is followed by a}} PYLIS downstream sequence.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{replication}} is for {{the most}} part extremely accurate, however errors (mutations) do occur. The error rate in eukaryotic cells can be as low as 10−8 per nucleotide per replication, whereas for some RNA viruses it can be as high as 10−3. This means that each generation, each human genome accumulates 1–2 new mutations. Small mutations can be caused by DNA replication and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point mutations in which a single base is altered and frameshift mutations in which a single base is inserted or deleted. Either of these mutations can change the gene by missense (change a codon <b>to</b> <b>encode</b> a different amino acid) or nonsense (a premature stop codon). Larger mutations can be caused by errors in recombination to cause chromosomal abnormalities including the duplication, deletion, rearrangement or inversion of large sections of a chromosome. Additionally, DNA repair mechanisms can introduce mutational errors when repairing physical damage to the molecule. The repair, even with mutation, is more important to survival than restoring an exact copy, for example when repairing double-strand breaks.|$|E
