5|$|After Gandhi {{returned}} from Second Round Table conference, {{he started a}} new satyagraha. He was arrested and imprisoned at the Yerwada Jail, Pune. While he was in prison, the British government enacted a new law that granted untouchables a separate electorate. It {{came to be known}} as <b>the</b> <b>Communal</b> Award. In protest, Gandhi started fast-unto-death, while he was held in prison. The resulting public outcry forced the government, in consultations with Ambedkar, to replace <b>the</b> <b>Communal</b> Award with a compromise Poona Pact.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{following}} {{protests from}} the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, {{the city was}} incorporated into the dominion of the newly created Maharashtra State from Bombay State. The city's secular fabric was torn apart in <b>the</b> <b>communal</b> riots of 1992–93, while the bombings of 1993 caused extensive loss of life and property.

5|$|During the Second World War, the Highfield {{location}} of the College meant it was directly in the war zone itself. With Southampton being attacked, the halls of residence were also under siege: at South Stoneham windows were blown in by bombs. The School of Navigation at the College was relocated to <b>the</b> <b>communal</b> rooms of South Stoneham House {{for the duration of}} the war, and afterwards was moved to Warsash; in 1970 the school became independent of the University (instead it is affiliated to Southampton Solent University) and is known as the Warsash Maritime Academy.|$|E
5|$|Ealdred had {{returned}} to England by 1055, and brought with him {{a copy of the}} Pontificale Romano-Germanicum, a set of liturgies, with him. An extant copy of this work, currently manuscript Cotton Vitellus E xii, has been identified as a copy owned by Ealdred. It appears likely that the Rule of Chrodegang, a continental set of ordinances for <b>the</b> <b>communal</b> life of secular canons, was introduced into England by Ealdred sometime before 1059. Probably he brought it back from Germany, possibly in concert with Harold.|$|E

5|$|Hoskuld died around 965, leaving Olaf a full mark of gold, causing {{tension between}} Olaf and Hoskuld's {{legitimate}} sons, Bard and Thorleik.

Olaf eased the tension by paying one-third of <b>the</b> <b>communal</b> funeral feast for Hoskuld.|$|E
5|$|Little {{evidence}} exists of settlements within the Rhondda during the Norman period. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>communal</b> dwellings of the Iron Age {{the remains of}} the Medieval buildings discovered in the area follow the pattern similar to modern farmsteads; with separate holdings spaced out around the hillsides. The evidence of Medieval Welsh farmers comes from {{the remains of the}}ir buildings, with the foundations of platform houses having been discovered spaced out throughout both valleys. When the site of several platform houses at Gelligaer Common were excavated in the 1930s potsherds dating from the 13th-14th century were discovered.|$|E
5|$|The second kingdom's {{economy was}} based on both {{agriculture}} and trade. The economy was centralized and directed through a communal organization, where grains were stored in communal granaries, and distributed amongst the population according to social statues. The organization also controlled the animal herds in the kingdom. Some people were directly connected to the palace instead of <b>the</b> <b>communal</b> organization, those included the metal and textile producers and the military officials. Ebla was an important trading partner and rival, Mari's position made it an important trading center as it controlled the road linking between the Levant and Mesopotamia.|$|E

5|$|During the Tudor {{conversion}} of the abbey to a private house the south range was extensively rebuilt, and only the north wall of the medieval structure remains, which makes tracing the monastic layout difficult. Going east to west, first came the day stair, then the warming house where <b>the</b> <b>communal</b> fire burned constantly to allow the monks to warm themselves after long hours of study in the unheated cloister. The room was probably vaulted and had its great fireplace on the west wall to allow heat {{to rise to the}} refectory or dining hall next door. It is likely that, as at the great Cistercian house Fountains Abbey, the chamber above the warming house was the muniment room, where the abbey's charters, records and title deeds, {{as well as those of}} local lords, were kept.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that spring}} Bryant and Reed heeded Vorse's call {{to spend the}} warm season in Provincetown, Massachusetts, {{at the tip of}} Cape Cod, and to take part in <b>the</b> <b>communal</b> theater {{productions}} of the Provincetown Players. Others from the Village went as well and joined the group, organized in 1915 by George Cram Cook and his wife, Susan Glaspell, who hoped to produce plays that were both political and artistic. Among the works the group staged in 1916 were Bryant's The Game, in which characters named Life and Death play dice for the lives of Youth (a poet) and Girl (a dancer). It appeared on the same bill as Not Smart by Wilbur Steele and Bound East for Cardiff by O'Neill.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War Trafford Park {{was largely}} {{turned over to}} the {{production}} of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124incendiaries and 120high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over <b>the</b> <b>communal</b> grave of the 17unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.|$|E

5|$|India {{believed}} that if Junagadh was permitted to go to Pakistan, <b>the</b> <b>communal</b> tension already simmering in Gujarat would worsen, and {{refused to accept the}} accession. The government pointed out that the state was 80% Hindu, and called for a plebiscite to decide the question of accession. Simultaneously, they cut off supplies of fuel and coal to Junagadh, severed air and postal links, sent troops to the frontier, and reoccupied the principalities of Mangrol and Babariawad that had acceded to India. Pakistan agreed to discuss a plebiscite, subject to the withdrawal of Indian troops, a condition India rejected. On 26 October, the Nawab and his family fled to Pakistan following clashes with Indian troops. On 7 November, Junagadh's court, facing collapse, invited the Government of India to take over the State's administration. The Government of India agreed. A plebiscite was conducted in February 1948, which went almost unanimously in favour of accession to India.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival at}} the {{terminus}} the mourners would be led either {{to one of the}} dedicated first class waiting rooms (for first and second class funerals) or to <b>the</b> <b>communal</b> third class waiting room. The coffin would be discreetly unloaded from the hearse and sent to the platform level by lift. Those attending first and second class funerals would be permitted to watch the coffins being loaded onto the train if they so wished. (After the relocation to the new London terminus in 1902, some funeral services would be held in a Chapelle Ardente on platform level, for those cases where mourners were unable to make the journey to Brookwood.) Each door of the waiting train would be labelled with the name of the deceased, to ensure all passengers travelled with the correct funeral party; the names of the deceased being carried on the train would be called in turn, and that person's mourners would board the train.|$|E
5|$|Raglan Castle {{was built}} in several phases, initial work {{occurring}} in the 1420s and 1430s, a major phase in the 1460s, with various alterations and additions {{at the end of}} the 16th century. The castle {{was built in}} stone, initially pale sandstone from Redbrook, and later Old Red Sandstone, with Bath Stone used for many of the detailed features. Like similar properties of the period, the castle of the 1460s was almost certainly designed to be approached and entered in a particular way, maximising the aesthetic and political value of the fortification. At Raglan, the design highlighted the Great Tower: a typical senior visitor would ride through Raglan village, and first the tower and then the rest of the castle would appear suddenly over the slight rise on the hill. A visitor would have needed to circle the Great Tower and the moat, before coming in through the gatehouse, into the Pitched Stone Court, around the edge of <b>the</b> <b>communal</b> hall, before reaching the previously hidden, and more refined, inner Fountain Court. Only then would a privileged guest be able to enter the Great Tower itself, overlooking the Herbert family's own chambers. Many less senior visitors or servants would never have entered this far, seeing only the external elements of the castle, but perhaps having been impressed by the outside of the Great Tower as they arrived.|$|E

5|$|The Indian Independence Act 1947 (10 & 11 Geo 6 c. 30) {{passed by}} the Parliament of the United Kingdom divided British India into the two new {{independent}} dominions; the Dominion of India (later to become the Republic of India) and the Dominion of Pakistan (later to become the Islamic Republic of Pakistan). The act provided a mechanism for division of the Bengal and Punjab provinces {{between the two nations}} (see partition of India), establishment of the office of the Governor-General, conferral of complete legislative authority upon the respective Constituent Assemblies, and division of joint property between the two new countries. The act later received royal assent on 18 July 1947. The partition was accompanied by violent riots and mass casualties, and the displacement of nearly 15 million people due to religious violence across the subcontinent; millions of Muslim, Sikh and Hindu refugees trekked the newly drawn borders to Pakistan and India respectively in the months surrounding independence. On 14 August 1947, the new Dominion of Pakistan became independent and Muhammad Ali Jinnah was sworn in as its first governor general in Karachi. Independence was marked with widespread celebration, but the atmosphere remained heated given <b>the</b> <b>communal</b> riots prevalent during independence in 1947.|$|E
5|$|Heinlein {{draws an}} analogy between the human {{society in the}} novel, which is well-to-do but needs to be {{vigilant}} against the imperialist threat of the Arachnids, and U.S. society of the 1950s. Reviewers {{have suggested that the}} Arachnids are Heinlein's analogue for communists. Traits used to support this include <b>the</b> <b>communal</b> nature of the Arachnids, which makes them capable of a much higher degree of coordination than the humans. Bug society is once explicitly described as communist, and is moreover depicted as communist by nature; this has been read as implying that those with a different political ideology are analogous to alien beings. The related motifs of alien invasion, of being patriotic to one's people, and personal sacrifice during war, are present, as are other aspects of U.S. popular culture of the 1950s. Commentators have argued that Heinlein's portrayal of aliens, as well as being a reference to people in communist countries, invokes the trope of a return to the frontier. The concept of the frontier includes a social-Darwinist argument of constantly fighting for survival, even at the expense of indigenous people or, in the case of Starship Troopers, of aliens. Heinlein suggests that without territorial expansion involving violent conquest of other races, humans would be destroyed. Scholar Jamie King has stated that Heinlein does not address the question of what the military government and Federal Service would do in peacetime, and argues that Heinlein has set up a society designed to be continuously at war, and to keep expanding its territory.|$|E
5|$|Incubation lasts {{thirteen}} days, {{although the}} last egg laid may take 24hours {{longer than the}} first to hatch. Both parents share the responsibility of brooding the eggs, but the female spends more time incubating them than does the male, {{and is the only}} parent to do so at night when the male returns to <b>the</b> <b>communal</b> roost. The young are born blind and naked. They develop light fluffy down within seven days of hatching and can see within nine days. Once the chicks are able to regulate their body temperature, about six days after hatching, the adults largely cease removing droppings from the nest. Prior to that, the fouling would wet both the chicks' plumage and the nest material, thereby reducing their effectiveness as insulation and increasing the risk of chilling the hatchlings. Nestlings remain in the nest for three weeks, where they are fed continuously by both parents. Fledglings continue to be fed by their parents for another one or two weeks. A pair can raise up to three broods per year, frequently reusing and relining the same nest, although two broods is typical, or just one north of 48°N. Within two months, most juveniles will have moulted and gained their first basic plumage. They acquire their adult plumage the following year. As with other passerines, the nest is kept clean and the chicks' faecal sacs are removed by the adults.|$|E
