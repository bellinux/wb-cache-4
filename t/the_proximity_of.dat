5|$|Polyethnicity {{refers to}} <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> people from {{different}} ethnic backgrounds within a country or other specific geographic region.

5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave located {{over the}} open Pacific Ocean organized into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on October 22. It strengthened into {{a tropical storm}} the next day. Shortly afterwards, wind shear increased. Lowell's convection was disrupted, and its center of circulation became exposed. The cyclone crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on October 26. The shear relaxed, and the depression restrengthened into a tropical storm. Lowell drifted in slow steering currents until it approached Hurricane Huko. <b>The</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> Huko caused a gradual weakening in Lowell, and it dissipated on October 31.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the weather}} had been mostly rainy {{up to this point}} in the campaign, a snow storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> the enemy lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E
5|$|Although the willie wagtail is an {{aggressive}} defender of its nest, predators do account for many eggs and young.

5|$|At {{a variety}} of elevations, meadows provide important, {{productive}} habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on the green grasses and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows. Predators, in turn, are attracted to these areas. The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include great grey owl, willow flycatcher, Yosemite toad, and mountain beaver.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes are {{involved}} in defending the territory. One aspect of territorial defense involves identifying <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> the threat based on the loudness of bird song {{as well as the}} level of degradation of the calls. In experiments involving playback, the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and undegraded songs, as well as degraded songs in the same acoustic conditions, and can detect changes of acoustic properties within their territories, such as songs under foliage. Song degradation {{can also be used to}} determine <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> potential intruders. If the song of a bird appears to be degraded, the wrens will assume that the threat is distant not respond; if the song is not degraded, they respond by attacking. Not all birds within their territory are potential enemies. Some species of birds that are neighbors are designated as 'dear-enemies' by the wrens, and the responses to neighbors and intruders in their territories differ by the season. In spring, the wrens respond more aggressively toward neighbors, though in the fall, no major discrepancy in responses is shown. When protecting their nest, alarm calls are the general response. The wrens judge the size of the potential threat, such as a blue jay and avoid the risk of injury when attacking. Countersinging produced by intruder birds is more likely to be taken as an aggressive threat to male Carolina wrens.|$|E
5|$|British Rail {{was split}} into business-led sectors in the 1980s, {{at which time}} {{operations}} at Stapleton Road passed to Regional Railways. All trains along the Severn Beach Line ran to Severn Beach, but the service pattern was irregular.

5|$|Cassel was {{annexed to}} France the {{following}} year {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Nijmegen, which ended the war. The annexation led to the town's defences being dismantled; it was considered indefensible, as it was within easy firing range of the nearby Mont des Récollets, and it would have cost far too much to fortify both hills. In addition, the revised frontier following the treaty was now a significant distance from Cassel and without <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> the border, the town was no longer seen as having much strategic significance.|$|E
