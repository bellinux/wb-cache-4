5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on the regulator surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output O-ring of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. <b>The</b> <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the O-ring between the surfaces of the regulator and valve. When the valve is opened, cylinder pressure expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the O-ring groove in the valve. Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the O-ring between the valve and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of connection is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E
5|$|Coleman has {{speculated that}} modern-day {{prosperity}} theology borrows heavily from the New Thought movement, though {{he admits that}} <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> sometimes unclear. Jenkins notes that critics draw a parallel between prosperity theology and the cargo cult phenomenon. While citing the popularity of prosperity theology in agrarian African communities, he argues that it can also bear similarities to traditional African religious rituals. J. Matthew Wilson of Southern Methodist University compares the movement to Black theology owing to its focus on uplifting oppressed groups, though he notes that it differs in its concentration on individual success rather than corporate political change.|$|E
5|$|In a {{telephone}} network, {{the caller is}} connected to the person they want to talk to by switches at various telephone exchanges. The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller dials the number. Once <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small microphone in the caller's handset. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small speaker in that person's handset.|$|E
50|$|The {{increasing}} {{usage of}} ICs (integrated circuits) with packages such as BGAs (ball grid array) where <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> underneath <b>the</b> chip and not visible, means that ordinary optical inspection <b>is</b> impossible. Because <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> underneath <b>the</b> chip package {{there is a}} greater need to ensure that the manufacturing process is able to accommodate these chips correctly. Additionally the chips that use BGA packages tend to be the larger ones with many <b>connections.</b> Therefore, it <b>is</b> essential that all <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> made correctly.|$|R
40|$|Växjö {{university}} has together with Södra {{developed a new}} green-glued laminated beam, which {{to be used in}} a building system. To make a product of the beam it is desired to also develop a building system based on the beam. An important part of such a building system <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>connections.</b> <b>The</b> main aim of the thesis was to design a new beam-to-beam <b>connection</b> in for <b>the</b> new green-glued laminated boards. This thesis is about to develop and test a new connection for a beam-to-beam <b>connection</b> in <b>the</b> building system. The requirements set on <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> that it should be used in an office building with a beam length of 6 m, <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> should <b>be</b> fast to assemble and invisible. The report thoroughly describes the conceptual design, the development and test of <b>the</b> <b>connection.</b> Five different types of <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> designed in <b>the</b> conceptual design phase. One of these <b>connections</b> fulfilled <b>the</b> requirements and was taken to the development and testing phase. Three versions of <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>were</b> tested. <b>The</b> report describes how the green-glued laminated beams with <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> tested in a testing machine until the failure occurs. <b>The</b> developed <b>connection</b> could fulfil <b>the</b> requirements set on <b>the</b> <b>connection.</b> One version of <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> even stronger than the green-glued laminated beams...|$|R

5|$|NY454 {{continues}} as a four-lane arterial {{through a large}} commercial district, intersecting with CR93 (Lakeland Avenue). There, the highway passes Long Island MacArthur Airport and bends to the east through another large commercial district remaining unchanged for several miles. The route turns to the southeast at Coates Avenue as a four-lane arterial {{for the last two}} miles (3.2km) of NY454. About three miles (4.8km) from Lakeland Avenue, NY454 connects to the Sunrise Highway (NY27) at exit51, a partial interchange in Holbrook. Here, the NY454 designation ends and its right-of-way merges into the eastbound service road of NY27. There is no access to westbound Sunrise Highway from NY454 itself; instead, <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> made by way of nearby Broadway Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Olivia {{suggests}} {{the possibility that}} the effect is due to quantum entanglement between Alice in the prime universe and Derek in the parallel one. Alice previously told Olivia that Derek died recently from trying to replace a faulty fuse after they flipped a coin to decide who would replace it, and Walter surmises that the parallel universe Alice died in a similar fashion due to a different outcome of the coin flip. Alice's connection to the parallel universe Derek is causing the crack. As the building starts to exhibit the initial signs of a singularity and Broyles (Lance Reddick) prepares to release the amber, Olivia and Peter attempt to persuade Alice that the man she sees is not really her husband. Alice does not believe them until Derek starts to refer to their children. Alice, who is childless, realizes Peter and Olivia are telling the truth; <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> broken and the effects on the building ebb away.|$|E

5|$|The {{symptoms}} {{produced by}} AVMs {{in the liver}} depend {{on the type of}} abnormal connection that they form between blood vessels. If <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> between arteries and veins, a large amount of blood bypasses the body's organs, for which the heart compensates by increasing the cardiac output. Eventually congestive cardiac failure develops ("high-output cardiac failure"), with breathlessness and leg swelling among other problems. If the AVM creates a connection between the portal vein and the blood vessels of the liver, the result may be portal hypertension (increased portal vein pressure), in which collateral blood vessels form in the esophagus (esophageal varices), which may bleed violently; furthermore, the increased pressure may give rise to fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity (ascites). If the flow in the AVM is in the other direction, portal venous blood flows directly into the veins rather than running through the liver; this may lead to hepatic encephalopathy (confusion due to portal waste products irritating the brain). Rarely, the bile ducts are deprived of blood, leading to severe cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts). Liver AVMs are detectable in over 70% of people with HHT, but only 10% experience problems as a result.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} Flow studied by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has been {{compared}} to Buddhist meditative states such as samadhi and mindfulness.

25|$|The newer Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) {{is also a}} reliable, connection-oriented {{transport}} mechanism. It is message-stream-oriented—not byte-stream-oriented like TCP—and provides multiple streams multiplexed over {{a single}} connection. It also provides multi-homing support, in which a connection end can be represented by multiple IP addresses (representing multiple physical interfaces), such that if one fails, <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> not interrupted. It was developed initially for telephony applications (to transport SS7 over IP), but {{can also be used}} for other applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} equations {{of motion}} are therefore satisfied {{if and only if}} the curvature vanishes everywhere, in which case <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> said to be flat. Thus the classical solutions to G Chern–Simons theory are the flat connections of principal G-bundles on M. Flat connections are determined entirely by holonomies around noncontractible cycles on the base M. More precisely, they are in one-to-one correspondence with equivalence classes of homomorphisms from the fundamental group of M to the gauge group G up to conjugation.|$|E
