In many jurisdictions, age of consent is a person's mental or functional age. As a result, those above the set age of consent may still be considered unable to legally consent due to mental immaturity. Many jurisdictions regard any sexual activity by an adult involving a child as child sexual abuse.|$|E

They also never succeeded in changing mainstream views regarding Rosas. William Spence Robertson said in 1930: [...] "Among the enigmatical personages of the 'Age of Dictators' in South America none played a more spectacular role than the Argentine dictator, Juan Manuel de Rosas, whose gigantic and ominous figure bestrode the Plata River {{for more than twenty}} years. So despotic was his power that Argentine writers have themselves styled <b>this</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> their history as 'The Tyranny of Rosas'." [...] In 1961, William Dusenberry said: [...] "Rosas is a negative memory in Argentina. He left behind him the black legend of Argentine history—a legend which Argentines in general wish to forget. There is no monument to him in the entire nation; no park, plaza, or street bears his name." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} the Hayflick limit was {{advanced}} by American anatomist Leonard Hayflick in 1961, at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Hayflick demonstrated that a population of normal human fetal cells in a cell culture will divide between 40 and 60 times. The population will then enter a senescence phase, which refutes the contention by Nobel laureate Alexis Carrel that normal cells are immortal. Each mitosis slightly shortens each of the telomeres on the DNA of the cells. Telomere shortening in humans eventually makes cell division impossible, and <b>this</b> <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> the cell population appears to correlate with the overall physical <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> the human body.|$|R

500|$|After Phips {{returned}} to London in August 1685, Samuel Pepys ordered the Navy Board {{to assess the}} Rose. Pepys {{had been out of}} power when Narborough set the strange plan in motion. In March and May 1686, Phips was ordered to attend the Lord Treasurer where {{it was found that the}} King was only to receive £471 in treasure, though the wear and tear on the Rose was estimated at £700. [...] In <b>this</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> piracy and high mortality, Phips making it back to London alive and with the King's ship still afloat was probably enough for him to pass the test. Already Narborough had a new plan in the works for Captain Phips, though this time it would be a private venture. Narborough's long infatuation with the Hispaniola treasure had not been diminished by Captain Stanley's discouragement on the Bonetta. And Knepp's report on Phips did not disqualify him. Phips had shown that he was serviceable: willing to harass the harbor of his hometown and to compromise between his own interests, and the interests of the crown. This was surely noted at Whitehall, even by the more conservative elements.|$|E
500|$|Darwin's contemporaries {{eventually}} came {{to accept the}} transmutation of species based upon fossil evidence, and the X Club was formed to defend evolution against the church and wealthy amateurs. At that time the specific evolutionary mechanism which Darwin provided of natural selection was actively disputed by scientists in favour of alternative theories such as Lamarckism and orthogenesis. Darwin's gradualistic account was also opposed by saltationism and catastrophism. Lord Kelvin led scientific opposition to gradualism {{on the basis of}} his thermodynamic calculations that the Earth was between 24 and 400 million years old, and own views favoured a version of theistic evolution accelerated by divine guidance. [...] <b>This</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> the earth was disputed by geological estimates, which gained strength in 1907 when radioactive dating of rocks showed that the Earth was billions of years old. [...] The specific hereditary mechanism Darwin hypothesized of pangenesis that supported gradualism also lacked any supporting evidence and was disputed by the empirical tests of Francis Galton. [...] Although evolution was unchallenged, uncertainties about the mechanism in the eclipse of Darwinism persisted from the 1880s until the 1930s [...] inclusion of Mendelian inheritance and the rise of the modern evolutionary synthesis.
