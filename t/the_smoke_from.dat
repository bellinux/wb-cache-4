5|$|The Ancient Egyptians {{believed}} that bee-eaters had medical properties, prescribing {{the application of}} bee-eater fat to deter biting flies, and treating the eyes with <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> charred bee-eater legs to cure an unspecified female complaint.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{had three}} tiers of {{artillery}} – the heaviest and longest range weapons occupying the upper levels, including the keep – {{with a total}} of 39 firing positions, and 31 gunloops in the basement for handguns should close defence be required. The embrasures in the walls were all widely splayed to provide the maximum possible space for the guns to operate and traverse, and the interior of the castle was designed with vents to allow <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> its guns to escape.|$|E
5|$|Who started {{shooting}} first is not certain; accounts by both participants and eyewitnesses are contradictory. <b>The</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> the black powder {{used in the}} weapons added to the confusion of the gunfight in the narrow space. Those loyal to {{one side or the}} other told conflicting stories, and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first. The six or seven men with guns fired about 30 shots in around 30 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the confusion over the color of the smoke in the 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of sealing wax on the ballots. The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke color {{on the first day of}} that conclave.|$|E
5|$|The DNC {{objected to}} the loss of the {{mainmast}} as he believed that it was needed to support a boat-handling derrick, but was overruled by the Admiralty, which preferred to position the tripod foremast behind the forward funnel with the tripod legs facing forward to allow the vertical leg to be used to support the derrick. This all but guaranteed that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable. The short height of the funnel also bedevilled the bridge with smoke until it was raised in 1912, although this exacerbated the problem for the spotting top. The decision to space the wing turrets more closely together also made the smoke problem worse; because it reduced the space available to the aft boiler room which meant that the forward funnel had to accommodate the exhausts of a dozen boilers compared to the aft funnel's six, further increasing <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> the forward funnel.|$|E
5|$|Despite its ferocity, {{the fire}} was mostly ineffectual. Confederate shells often {{overshot}} the infantry front lines—in some cases because of inferior shell fuses that delayed detonation—and the smoke covering the battlefield concealed that fact from the gunners. Union artillery chief Brig. Gen. Henry J. Hunt had only about 80 guns available to conduct counter-battery fire; the geographic features of the Union line had limited areas for effective gun emplacement. He also ordered that firing cease to conserve ammunition, but to fool Alexander, Hunt ordered his cannons to cease fire slowly {{to create the illusion}} that they were being destroyed one by one. By the time all of Hunt's cannons ceased fire, and still blinded by <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> battle, Alexander fell for Hunt's deception and believed that many of the Union batteries had been destroyed. Hunt had to resist the strong arguments of Hancock, who demanded Union fire to lift the spirits of the infantrymen pinned down by Alexander's bombardment. Even Meade was affected by the artillery—the Leister house was a victim of frequent overshots, and he had to evacuate with his staff to Powers Hill.|$|E

5|$|Giraffes were {{probably}} common targets for hunters throughout Africa. Different {{parts of their}} bodies were used for different purposes. Their meat was used for food. The tail hairs served as flyswatters, bracelets, necklaces and thread. Shields, sandals and drums were made using the skin, and the strings of musical instruments were from the tendons. <b>The</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> burning giraffe skins {{was used by the}} medicine men of Buganda to treat nose bleeds. The Humr people of Sudan consume the drink Umm Nyolokh; which is created from the liver and marrow of giraffes. Umm Nyolokh often contains DMT and other psychoactive substances from plants the giraffes eat such as Acacia; and is known to cause hallucinations of giraffes, believed to be the giraffes' ghosts by the Humr. In the 19th century, European explorers began to hunt them for sport. Habitat destruction has hurt the giraffe, too: in the Sahel, the need for firewood and grazing room for livestock has led to deforestation. Normally, giraffes can coexist with livestock, since they do not directly compete with them.|$|E

25|$|In Aztec mythology, the Fourth Sun {{disappeared}} {{in a great}} flood.

25|$|A {{less common}} but {{increasingly}} popular alternative to smoking is vaporizers, which use hot air convection {{to deliver the}} substance without combustion, which may reduce health risks.

25|$|A {{second account}} {{states that the}} French cavalry {{attacked}} first. Eugène sent Pully and Sahuc charging at the Austrian guns in a pincer attack. Under cover of <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> the two artilleries blasting away at each other, the French divisions struck Reisner's gun line from both flanks. While some horsemen began cutting down the gunners, the others galloped among the Austrian cavalry which was formed up behind the guns.|$|E
25|$|The Lapstone Zig Zag {{became a}} {{bottleneck}} because, among other reasons, {{the length of}} the top and bottom roads restricted train lengths. A single-track tunnel was built in 1892 to replace the zig zag. However, this tunnel was on a steep gradient, with a ruling grade of 1 in 33, which caused problems with <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> hard-working locomotives. These problems pre-dated the fume problems with the first Cascade Tunnel {{on the opposite side of}} the world.|$|E
25|$|The A-10 engines were {{initially}} susceptible to flameout when subjected to gases {{generated in the}} firing of the gun. When the GAU-8 is being fired, <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> the gun can make the engines stop, and this did occur during initial flight testing. Gun exhaust is essentially oxygen-free, and is certainly capable of causing flameouts of gas turbines. The A-10 engines now have a self-sustaining combustion section. When the gun is fired the igniters come on to reduce {{the possibility of a}} flameout.|$|E

25|$|Locomotives of Rockets era {{were fired}} by coke rather than coal.

It was not until 30 years later {{and the development of}} the long firebox and brick arch that locomotives would be effectively able to burn coal directly.|$|E
25|$|Famous as the {{measurement}} is, it was beset by problems, {{not least of}} which was the haze created by <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> forest fires which blurred the mirror image. It is also probable that the intensively detailed work of the geodetic survey, with an estimated error of less than one part in 1 million, was compromised by a shift in the baseline arising from the Santa Barbara earthquake of June 29, 1925, which was an estimated magnitude of 6.3 on the Richter scale.|$|E
25|$|Tobacco use leads most {{commonly}} to diseases affecting {{the heart and}} lungs, with smoking being a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), emphysema, and cancer (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, esophageal cancer and pancreatic cancer). Cigarette smoking increases the risk of Crohn's disease as well as the severity of the course of the disease. It is also the number one cause of bladder cancer. <b>The</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> tobacco elicits carcinogenic effects on the tissues of the body that are exposed to the smoke.|$|E
