5|$|Raiden's debut role as {{the protagonist}} of Metal Gear Solid 2 was controversial, however, due to his {{unexpected}} substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics have defended the character, stating <b>that</b> <b>fans</b> were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been highly praised for his role and Metal Gear Solid 4 redesign and even more for his role and design in Revengeance.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} mixed to poor reviews. Critics {{found its}} physics modelling unrealistic, and many {{believed that the}} game's graphics and gameplay were outdated, {{particularly in light of}} contemporary simulators like IL-2 Sturmovik. The limited number of missions and large number of glitches were widely panned. Certain critics enjoyed Jane's Attack Squadrons air-to-ground combat and several hoped <b>that</b> <b>fans</b> would improve the game with the included physics and mission editors.|$|E
25|$|In January 2012, it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>Fanning</b> signed to be represented by WME (William Morris Endeavor), thus ending a decade-long association with Osbrink Talent Agency. In April 2014, it was announced <b>that</b> <b>Fanning</b> switched agencies again and is now represented by CAA.|$|R
50|$|By 940, Fan had retired, {{and wanted}} to take up {{residence}} at Heyang. Shi initially agreed. Yang, however, was both envious of the wealth he had and concerned that, given their past adversarial relationship during the Guangjin campaign, <b>that</b> <b>Fan</b> might be up to no good. He thus suggested to Shi <b>that</b> <b>Fan</b> be killed. Shi refused, but agreed with Yang's subsequent proposal to have Fan take up residence at Luoyang. Yang subsequently surrounded Fan's mansion with his soldiers, and later dragged Fan to the Yellow River and pushed him into it to drown, while claiming <b>that</b> <b>Fan</b> had committed suicide.|$|R

5|$|The team's Vice President of Public Relations has {{defended the}} use of Chief Wahoo, saying <b>that</b> <b>fans</b> only {{associate}} Wahoo with baseball.

5|$|UK Anime's Kevin Leathers criticized {{its lack}} of {{entertaining}} story arcs, and Anime News Network's Casey Brienza called the anime a poor adaptation of the manga. Allen's English-language voice actor, Todd Haberkorn, said that anime sales were poor despite generally-positive reviews; he suggested <b>that</b> <b>fans</b> buy DVDs on sale to keep the series from being cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Aqua's {{character}} has received mixed response from video game publications, with initial comments {{focused on her}} brief appearance in Kingdom Hearts II. Writing for GamesRadar, Chris Antista commented {{that he did not}} understand the importance of Aqua and the other characters being briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II; only later was their importance explored at the end of Birth by Sleep. Prior to Aqua's appearance in Birth by Sleeps trailers, 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish stated <b>that</b> <b>fans</b> speculated the character would be male. Having played a demo from Birth by Sleep as Aqua in the E3 2010, Ryan Clements from IGN enjoyed her character due to her gameplay mechanics.|$|E

60|$|Ever {{since her}} {{marriage}} {{she had been}} haunted {{with the thought that}} there had been something more than a mere acquaintance between Merton and this lady. Her husband himself had given her that suspicion by the disparaging way he had invariably spoken of her, and his desire to know everything <b>that</b> <b>Fan</b> had said about her. <b>That</b> <b>Fan</b> had never told her anything was no proof that there was nothing to tell, since the girl was strangely close about some things.|$|R
40|$|A {{recently}} identified protein, FAN 1 (FANCD 2 -associated nuclease 1, previously {{known as}} KIAA 1018), {{is a novel}} nuclease associated with monoubiquitinated FANCD 2 that is required for cellular resistance against DNA interstrand crosslinking (ICL) agents. The mechanisms of FAN 1 regulation {{have not yet been}} explored. Here, we provide evidence <b>that</b> <b>FAN</b> 1 is degraded during mitotic exit, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>FAN</b> 1 may be a mitotic substrate of the anaphase-promoting cyclosome complex (APC/C). Indeed, Cdh 1, but not Cdc 20, was capable of regulating the protein level of FAN 1 through the KEN box and the D-box. Moreover, the up- and down-regulation of FAN 1 affected the progression to mitotic exit. Collectively, these data suggest <b>that</b> <b>FAN</b> 1 may be a new mitotic substrate of APC/CCdh 1 that plays a key role during mitotic exit...|$|R
5|$|By {{the mid-1980s}} heavy metal had {{branched}} {{in so many}} different directions <b>that</b> <b>fans,</b> record companies, and fanzines created numerous subgenres. The United States was especially known for one of these subgenres, thrash metal, which was innovated by bands like Anthrax, Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Testament, Exodus, Nuclear Assault, Death Angel, Mono Men, The DT's, OFF!, and Overkill, with Metallica being the most commercially successful. The United States was {{known as one of the}} birthplaces of Death Metal during the mid to late 1980s. The Florida scene was the most well-known, featuring bands like Death, Morbid Angel, Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, Malevolent Creation, Obituary, and many others. There are now countless death metal and deathgrind bands across the country.|$|E
5|$|Fans gained {{national}} attention after giving a torrid time to David Beckham {{in his first}} away match of 1998–99 the season after the England midfielder was sent off for a petulant foul on Diego Simeone. Coinciding with the game, there were claims (and an image taken) <b>that</b> <b>fans,</b> organised by a hardcore, had hung an effigy of the player outside a local pub. Although it was later revealed that the pub was in South-East London, the heartland of West Ham's greatest rivals Millwall. The West Ham fans did, however, boo Beckham's every touch of the ball during the game.|$|E
5|$|Halo.Bungie.Org is {{the most}} widely read Halo fansite. In 2007, it {{received}} about 600,000 page views a day. The site covers game news and rumors, strategy, fan-made machinima, stories and art, contests and forums. In the site's early years, it received {{only a small amount}} of fan-submitted material, which has ballooned since and made constant site maintenance a challenge. Errera attributes the site's longevity {{to the fact that it}} provided fans with not just Halo news but a place to share their love of the franchise. At a time when there was no easy video sharing via YouTube, Halo.bungie.org posted and categorized Halo films <b>that</b> <b>fans</b> submitted.|$|E

50|$|There were rumours <b>that</b> <b>Fan</b> Bingbing {{would be}} portraying Pan Jinlian. However, {{during the opening}} ceremony, Fan's {{spokesperson}} denied those claims and accused the production team of using Fan's name {{as a means of}} advertising the series. She added <b>that</b> <b>Fan</b> will only participate in projects her own company is involved in. Zheng Shuang, who played Hu Sanniang in The Water Margin (1997), also expressed interest in taking on the (more challenging) role of Pan Jinlian. However, Gan Tingting was eventually cast as Pan Jinlian.|$|R

The band {{performed}} and answered questions in MuchMusic's studios in Toronto, Ontario. The session was broadcast live to HMV stores worldwide and on a webcast so <b>that</b> <b>fans</b> could watch and ask the band questions through MuchMusic's VJs. Sales of Tragic Kingdom doubled the week after the event. The event's sponsors lobbied Guinness World Records to create a category for the largest virtual in-store promotion to recognize the event.|$|E
5|$|In September, {{a casting}} call sheet {{leaked to the}} Internet {{revealed}} that Cobra Commander would appear in the sequel, though it was unknown who would play the character. Chu said <b>that</b> <b>fans</b> would {{get a glimpse of}} Destro in the film, but Christopher Eccleston would not reprise his role in the sequel. On May 1, 2012, it was confirmed by Jon Chu that G.I. Joe: Retaliations Cobra Commander is Rex Lewis, the same character that Joseph Gordon-Levitt played in The Rise of Cobra. Actor Robert Baker confirmed that he is the voice of Cobra Commander in the sequel.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the CHA and one of the teams that had {{rejected}} Renfrew. However, after a few poorly attended games showed <b>that</b> <b>fans</b> had no interest in the league, Ottawa and the Montreal Shamrocks abandoned the CHA to join the NHA. Ottawa, the defending Stanley Cup champion and Wanderers' rival, was readily accepted by the NHA. This enabled Ottawa to continue the rivalry with the Wanderers and take in the gate revenues those games provided. The Wanderers won the championship in 1910, and Ottawa won in 1911 and 1915.|$|E

50|$|Brenner notes <b>that</b> <b>fan</b> {{service can}} be offputting to teen readers, as in a male reading shoujo manga or a female reading shonen manga, and <b>that</b> in general <b>fan</b> service is more criticised when it {{features}} a female character. She cites Tenjo Tenge {{as an example of}} a fan service-laden series.|$|R
5|$|Reviewers {{have liked}} finding contradictions; a common complaint, however, is the games' linearity, {{as well as}} how the player {{sometimes}} has to resort to a trial-and-error method due to the games only accepting specific pieces of evidence, and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a specific order. Some reviewers have criticized the lack of changes to the gameplay and presentation throughout the series, while some have said <b>that</b> <b>fans</b> of the series would not have a problem with this.|$|E
5|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Andy Saunders at the Bournemouth International Centre in January 2012, as part of One Direction's Up All Night Tour (2011–12). On 9 May 2012, Sony Music Australia disclosed via social networking website Twitter that a video for the track would premiere on 11 May. A 30-second preview of the clip, which showed the group gather around a couch onstage and sing the piece, premiered on Entertainment Tonight on 9 May. On 11 May, the clip debuted, a live performance of the song featured on their debut video album, , which was released on 28 May. Writing for MTV News, Jocelyn Vena suggested <b>that</b> <b>fans</b> would appreciate the clip's sequences.|$|E
5|$|The {{cancellation}} {{resulted in}} protests by fans, both at Paramount Studios {{and around the}} world as well as online. A website entitled TrekUnited.com was set up to raise funds for a fifth season, but failed to do so with the money refunded after the unsuccessful campaign. A total of $32 million had been raised. Several years later, the possibility of a fifth season was still being discussed with Braga suggesting <b>that</b> <b>fans</b> could prompt Netflix into producing a new season of Enterprise by watching the existing four seasons on the service. This resulted in a Facebook campaign set up to promote the idea of a fifth season.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's {{victory in}} the ACC Championship Game had {{far-reaching}} sporting consequences for the 20072008 college football bowl season {{and in the future}} site of the ACC Championship Game. The 2007game injected approximately $10million into the Jacksonville economy. Thousands of hotel rooms were filled by fans traveling to the game, and the impact they created was larger than that of the previous year's game, which featured teams that had shorter distances to travel and whose fans had generated less demand for overnight accommodation. Despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>fans</b> spent more in 2007 than at any previous ACC Championship Game, poor ticket sales at the box office necessitated a move.|$|E
5|$|Angel of Darkness was {{received}} poorly, prompting Eidos—fearing financial troubles from another unsuccessful game—to give development duties for future titles to Crystal Dynamics, another Eidos subsidiary. The Legacy of Kain development team {{began work on}} a new title (Tomb Raider: Legend), and Toby Gard returned {{to work as a}} consultant. The development team reassessed the brand value of the franchise and its protagonist. Chip Blundell, Eidos's vice-president of brand management, commented that the designers understood <b>that</b> <b>fans</b> saw the character and brand as their own, rather than Eidos's. With that in mind, the team retooled the franchise and character to emphasise aspects of the original game that made them unique. The storyline intended for a trilogy of games that started with Angel of Darkness was abandoned and a new plot was created for Legend.|$|E
5|$|Cloud {{has been}} merchandised extensively, in many {{different}} forms, including figurines and jewelry. In commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary, Square released figurines of him alongside other Final Fantasy protagonists. Square Enix's manager of merchandise, Kanji Tashiro, said at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con International that Cloud's likeness has produced some of the company's best-selling items, and <b>that</b> <b>fans</b> could look forward to further adaptations of the character in the future. Popular models at the time included Cloud's Advent Children figurine and Final Fantasy VII Hardy-Daytona bike set, both of which sold particularly well in European and North American markets. Square has also released two promotional books primarily focusing on Cloud's character: Cloud vol.1, which was released in 2007, and Cloud message, in 2008. In 2013, {{a replica of the}} Buster Sword was created by blacksmith Tony Swatton for the webseries Man at Arms.|$|E
