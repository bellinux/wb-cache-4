The apartments in the forebuilding were abandoned and this part of the keep fell into decay as well. In 1644, the lands surrounding the castle were disparked, bringing an end to Castle Rising Chase. In 1705 stone was stripped from the castle to help repair a nearby sluice gate.|$|E

5|$|After {{peace was}} {{achieved}} with France in 1558, military attention shifted towards the Spanish {{threat to the}} increasingly prosperous south-west side of England. Tensions with Spain grew and invasion appeared likely in 1589, resulting in royal permission being given <b>to</b> <b>reuse</b> the stonework from the East Blockhouse for new coastal defences, but this work was not carried out.

30|$|An {{obstacle}} <b>to</b> software <b>reuse</b> is {{the large}} number of major modifications that frequently have to be made as a consequence of dependencies within the reused software components. In this paper, common coupling is categorized and used as a measure of the dependencies between software components. We compared common coupling in three operating systems, Linux, FreeBSD, and Mach, and related it <b>to</b> the <b>reuse</b> effort of these systems. The measure is evaluated by studying the creation of two operating systems, MkLinux which is based on the reuse of Linux and Mach, and Darwin which is based on the reuse of FreeBSD and Mach. We conclude that the way that common coupling is implemented in Linux kernel induces large dependencies between software components, which required more effort in order <b>to</b> be <b>reused</b> <b>to</b> produce MkLinux, while the common coupling implemented in the Mach and FreeBSD kernels induces few dependencies between software components, which required less effort in order <b>to</b> be <b>reused</b> <b>to</b> produce Darwin.|$|R

Clement Winstanley reportedly wanted to pull the northern ruins down, intending <b>to</b> <b>reuse</b> the bricks to make a barn, but his son, also called Clement, intervened, and subsequently carried out repairs to the castle. By the 19th century the ruins were covered in ivy; by the early 20th century, trees were growing out of the tops of the walls, which were frequented by grazing goats and cattle. Much of the moat had silted up and {{the remains of the}} bridge had been buried by the accumulated debris.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} {{team had}} access to Codemasters' full audio library, which was composed of sound assets dating from the first Colin McRae Rally (1998) up to Grid 2 (2013). On a case-by-case basis, they decided whether <b>to</b> <b>reuse</b> existing sounds or update them. The result {{was a combination of}} audio from various games; suspensions sounds were taken from Dirt 3, wind, gearbox and mechanical samples from Colin McRae Rally 2005, garage sounds from , and music from Colin McRae Rally 04. One aspect of the audio that was kept intact was the original pacenotes read by professional co-driver Nicky Grist. The team did not want to disrupt the timing and delivery of critical track information so they opted to use the original recordings in this case. Support for custom soundtracks was added so that players could listen to their own music in-game.|$|E
5|$|The hen flea (Ceratophyllus gallinae) is {{the most}} common flea in their nests. The small, pale house-sparrow flea C. fringillae, is also {{occasionally}} found there and probably arises from the habit of its main host of taking over the nests of other species. This flea does not occur in the US, even on house sparrows. Lice include Menacanthus eurystemus, Brueelia nebulosa and Stumidoecus sturni. Other arthropod parasites include Ixodes ticks and mites such as Analgopsis passerinus, Boydaia stumi, Dermanyssus gallinae, Ornithonyssus bursa, O. sylviarum, Proctophyllodes species, Pteronyssoides truncatus and Trouessartia rosteri. The hen mite D. gallinae is itself preyed upon by the predatory mite Androlaelaps casalis. The presence of this control on numbers of the parasitic species may explain why birds are prepared <b>to</b> <b>reuse</b> old nests.|$|E

Specifically, the Army also had plans <b>to</b> <b>reuse</b> the funds allocated to the Comanche program to speed up development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which could also perform the scouting role intended for the vehicle. At the time of its termination, the Comanche program had reportedly spent US$6.9billion.

5|$|Regular series {{character}} designer Yoshitaka Amano's concept art {{became the}} basis for the models in the full motion videos produced for the game's PlayStation re-release. Tetsuya Takahashi, one of the graphic directors, drew the imperial Magitek Armors seen in the opening scene. By doing so, he disregarded Sakaguchi's intention <b>to</b> <b>reuse</b> the regular designs from elsewhere in the game. The sprite art for the characters' in-game appearance was drawn by Kazuko Shibuya. While in the earlier installments, the sprites were less detailed on the map than in battle, Final Fantasy VIs had an equally high resolution regardless of the screen. This enabled the use of animations depicting a variety of movements and facial expressions. Though it was not the first game to utilize the Super NES' Mode 7 graphics, Final Fantasy VI made more extensive use of them than its predecessors. For instance, unlike both Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy V, the world map is rendered in Mode 7, which lends a somewhat three-dimensional perspective to an otherwise two-dimensional game.|$|E

5|$|As a {{video game}} company with {{different}} production teams, Square had wished for its employees to efficiently share their know-how and technology even before the merger with its competitor Enix. The desire for a common development infrastructure and engine {{dates back to the}} 1997 role-playing video game Final Fantasy Tactics, which was created in the transitional period from 2D to 3D game production. Back then, the artists working on the game asked programmer Taku Murata for a fast way to check how their work would look in the final game. As the development was carried out on personal computers, the graphics were displayed on computer monitors. This looked very different from the PlayStation console's actual graphics displayed on a television screen. Initially, a faithful preview of the game's visuals was too time-consuming because all data had to be transferred from PC to console first. To evade this step, Murata created an instant preview tool. With this, he soon witnessed a boost in the artists' productivity and in the quality of their work. For 2000's Vagrant Story, the developers opted <b>to</b> <b>reuse</b> this instant preview tool rather than programming a new one from scratch. Murata and his colleagues added new functions to create a unified preview and cutscene tool tailored to the game's fully polygonal 3D graphics. With 2001's PlayOnline service, the company then made its first foray into introducing a common software for all its divisions.|$|E
5|$|Diarist Samuel Pepys {{commented on}} the {{condition}} of Rochester Castle, and as early as the 17thcentury the castle may have acted as a tourist attraction. By this time many castles were in a state of ruin, and Rochester was amongst those in need of repair, although still in use. In 1610 JamesI granted Sir Anthony Weldon control of the castle. During the English Civil War, Weldon declared for the Parliamentarian cause. The castle did not see fighting during the war, even though the city was captured by Royalists in 1648; this may indicate that the castle was not a serviceable fortification by this point. Weldon's support for the Parliamentarians may have spared the castle from slighting (demolition) in the aftermath, a fate shared by many other castles. Walker Weldon inherited the castle and carried out the destruction of part of the outer wall in the 18thcentury to sell off the building material; he had originally intended to dismantle more of the castle, but the plans were abandoned. A drawing from around this time suggests that the cross wall had been removed by this point. While other parts of the castle were dismantled, the two towers in the south-east wall were still being used for accommodation. In 1743 prisoners were held at the castle, probably in huts. Rochester Castle descended through the Weldon family until it was bequeathed to Thomas Blechynden in the 18thcentury. By 1774 Robert Child was in possession of the castle, and it remained in the possession of his family until 1884. There were unsuccessful plans in 1780 <b>to</b> <b>reuse</b> Rochester Castle as an army barracks, after the commander of the Royal Engineers for Chatham, Colonel Hugh Debbieg, asked the Child family for permission. The castle ruins inspired a painting by artist J. M. W. Turner in the late 18thcentury, one of his first oil paintings. Turner was renowned for his love of nature and was {{at the forefront of the}} picturesque movement, during which such ruins became fashionable.|$|E

40|$|The term 'simulation model reuse' can {{be taken}} to mean various things from the reuse of small {{portions}} of code, through component <b>reuse,</b> <b>to</b> the <b>reuse</b> of complete models. On a more abstract level, component design, model design and modelling knowledge are prime candidates for reuse. The reuse of simulation models is especially appealing, based on the intuitive argument that it should reduce the time and cost for model development. In a discussion with four simulation modelling experts, however, a number of issues were raised that mean these benefits may not be obtainable. These issues include the motivation to develop reusable models, the validity and credibility of models <b>to</b> be <b>reused,</b> and the cost and time for familiarisation. An alternative simulation methodology was proposed, that may lend itself better <b>to</b> model <b>reuse.</b> (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
