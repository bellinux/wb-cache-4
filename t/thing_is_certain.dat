25|$|I am {{very fond}} of jazz music, and I swear by all the devils in the nether regions that every person shall be spared in whose home a jazz band {{is in full swing}} at the time I have just mentioned. If {{everyone}} has a jazz band going, well, then, so much the better for you people. One <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> and that is that some of your people who do not jazz it out on that specific Tuesday night (if there be any) will get the axe.|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximate}} 1000 feet long, {{was released}} on July 8, 1910. Theaters in Indiana and Pennsylvania were among those which advertised the film, one specifically focusing on the film having dealing with [...] "the labor question". A review in The Moving Picture News was contained detailed praise of the film's relevance and success in portraying the subject. The reviewer states, [...] "This film strikes home. ... The situation has been lived in New York City. The strike and its miseries are not forgotten. Whoever arranged the story had a big, tender heart and knew what appeals to the masses. The glee with which the superintendent's discomfiture was hailed by the audience spoke volumes. We wish {{some of the pictures}} were not quite so vividly black and white. Mayhap the tenseness of the situation hit the cameraman. Be that as it may, one <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> - there is no melodrama, but scenes out of real life." [...] While the reviewer in this case refers to the scenario being drawn from real life, the happy ending is termed as a fantasy by reviewer in The Moving Picture World who states, [...] " [...] of those pictures which thrill one despite their improbability. It may go in stories but never in fact, that an owner of a factory marries one of his girl employees, and a strike leader at that..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although no solid proof exists, rumors abound that Alamo Foods {{used the}} old brewery {{equipment}} {{for more than}} [...] "La Perla", and that, in fact, the brewery still bottled a tiny amount of the real Pearl and Texas Pride for close friends and sale on the black market. [...] One <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> though: when the Blaine Act ended Prohibition at midnight on September 15, 1933, within minutes, 100 trucks and 25 railroad boxcars loaded with beer rolled out of the brewery grounds.|$|E

60|$|One <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain.</b> He {{could not}} give the {{required}} assurance to the detective. He must gain time.|$|R
60|$|One <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain.</b> Whatever {{happened}} I must {{regain the}} letter. Personally {{it was to}} me of greater importance than the exposure {{of what was going}} on aboard the schooner.|$|R
2500|$|If {{we could}} accept the {{somewhat}} obscure statement of Eusebius that Hegesippus [...] "made some quotations from the Gospel {{according to the}} Hebrews and from the Syriac Gospel," [...] {{we should have a}} reference to a Syriac New Testament as early as 160–180 AD, the time of that Hebrew Christian writer. One <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> the earliest New Testament of the Syriac church lacked not only the Antilegomena – 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude, and the Apocalypse – but the whole of the Catholic Epistles. These were at a later date translated and received into the Syriac Canon of the New Testament, as the quotations of the early Syrian Fathers take no notice of these New Testament writings.|$|E
2500|$|Music {{channels}} {{owned by}} Viacom, including MTV and VH1, refused to air Jackson's videos or only aired them in minor rotation following the incident, stated to be [...] "a major catalyst" [...] in the album's performance. The Associated Press stated [...] "MTV's [...] "Spanking New" [...] videos in heavy rotation include a gyrating, cleavage-baring Beyoncé [...] and a bleeped-out Eminem with his group D12 [...] Yet the sedate new video from Janet Jackson—a fixture {{on the cable}} channel {{for almost two decades}} and its first [...] "MTV Icon"—has been absent from its playlist. Meanwhile, Jackson's name had barely been mentioned on MTV—unusual for a superstar whose previous projects have typically gotten heavy promotion." [...] Jackson's collaborator Jimmy Jam commented [...] "You can probably read between the lines with MTV." [...] "I would guess that if MTV wanted to play it, they would, but this is just speculation on my part. It certainly could raise a few questions if you have an investigative mind." [...] Jam also commented, [...] "It's tough to click with audiences when you don't get support from the major media outlets." [...] "It's interesting because the video was sent to Viacom" [...] – [...] "but somehow MTV didn't ?" [...] Roger Friedman of Fox News ridiculed the decision; stating [...] "One <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> however: Janet is being scapegoated for her Super Bowl [...] "wardrobe malfunction." [...] Imagine that MTV, where illiteracy and lewdness thrive most of the day, would banish Janet's new video because of her [...] "reputation." [...] Who are they trying to kid? Of course, MTV is a corporate cousin of CBS, where the original snafu happened. But that's just a coincidence!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Daisy {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most music critics, although fan reactions were more mixed. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 75, based on twelve reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Drew Beringer of AbsolutePunk commented [...] "Daisy is auditory proof, {{as this is}} the Long Island quintet’s most challenging and distinguished album yet", believing [...] "Some will love it, some will hate it, most will be perplexed by it and will need many listens to digest it. But one <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> this is a record that will shake you". Dan Martin of NME described Daisy as a [...] "breathtakingly accomplished record" [...] calling the Brand New the [...] "most graceful rock band in America". Rock Sound also heaped praise upon the album, making comparisons to The Cure, The Smiths and Nirvana. Chris Hidden described the album as a more refined version of previous album, The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me, summarising that [...] "Brand New are now artistically unrivalled by their peers; it would be astonishing if they didn’t see where else they could go". Mikael Wood, journalist for Spin magazine particularly praised the moments of surprise throughout the album. [...] "Jesse Lacey howls about burning in bed and turning to dirt while his bandmates churn out noisy, jagged art-punk riffs that routinely explode without warning. The sound is old-fashioned, but the fury is fresh". Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone praised the band for not sticking to genre restraints; [...] "The quartet's fourth album avoids genre commonplaces with subtle shadings. 'You tried to put a fire out, but you used gasoline' — and songs like the heroin-jag slow-burner [...] "Bed" [...] prove that letting rip isn't always Lacey's best move." [...] Adam Downer of Sputnikmusic gave the album a 5/5, declaring [...] "Daisy is broken and Daisy is violent. It is not romantic {{and it is not}} particularly deep. It’s this writhing, bitter little record, obsessed with mortality as if the thing were breathing down its neck." ...|$|E
60|$|But one <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain,</b> {{and that}} <b>was,</b> {{now that he}} had become {{involved}} with his new acquaintances to a <b>certain</b> extent, it <b>was</b> necessary for him to continue with them until he could leave without either compromising himself or injuring them.|$|R
60|$|One <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain.</b> Rowley, that morning, {{should not}} be {{entrusted}} with a razor and the handling of my chin. I sent {{him back to his}} bed, with orders not to rise from it without permission; and went about my toilette deliberately. In spite of the lad, I did not enjoy the prospect of Mrs. McRankine.|$|R
60|$|One <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain,</b> {{that the}} WHITE kitten had {{had nothing to}} do with it:--it was the black kitten's fault entirely. For the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it COULDN'T have had any hand in the mischief.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it is queer. One <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> she overheard a {{good deal}} more of that 'private conversation' than she was willing to admit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{depends on}} how they act. One <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> I {{am not going to}} stand for any more of their underhanded work," [...] {{answered}} Dave, grimly.|$|E
6000|$|... "One <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> that fellow, {{whoever he}} is, is in trouble," [...] {{returned}} Tom. [...] "Perhaps {{we had better}} yell to those other fellows to stop." ...|$|E
5000|$|Some demonstrations prove {{only that}} the <b>things</b> <b>are</b> a <b>certain</b> way, rather than why they are so. The latter are the most perfect.|$|R
60|$|They {{were handed}} round for inspection. Rough and uncut as they stood, it was, of course, {{impossible}} to judge of their value. But one <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain.</b> The men of science {{had been watching}} close at the first, and were sure Herr Schleiermacher had not put the stones in; they were keen at the withdrawal, and were equally sure he had taken them honestly out of the pannikins.|$|R
50|$|The film ends as Satyaveer quietly walks out. He {{remarks that}} the only <b>thing</b> that <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> in an unknown world is a known God.|$|R
6000|$|... "One <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> we can't stay here!" [...] {{came from}} Snap. [...] "Let us go {{straight}} downhill. That {{will bring us}} to water sooner or later." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. And another <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> too," [...] added Jack. [...] "That is, Uncle Barney isn't {{going to}} let them have it if he can {{possibly}} stop them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They'll hustle him off pretty lively, that's sure. Well, one <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> he won't bother {{this party}} any more," [...] added Dave. [...] "Let us get back." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir Isaac's malignity had {{softened}} {{a little}} {{at the prospect of}} victory. [...] "Absolutely impossible," [...] he said. [...] "Everything disturbs her, every tiny <b>thing.</b> You----You'd <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> to." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{the worst}} of it was that, as she well knew, sooner or later all this about Mr. Davies must come to the ears of her father, and then what would happen? One <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain.</b> In his present poverty-stricken {{condition}} he would move heaven and earth to bring about her marriage to this rich man. Her father never had been very scrupulous where money was concerned, and the pinch of want was not likely to make him more so.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a pity," [...] he said, [...] "that {{he changed}} his mind. For one <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> very <b>certain.</b> The Duke and I are agreed upon it. A Brott {{ministry}} must never be formed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> I can't walk just yet," [...] said Tom. [...] "When I put my {{foot down}} it's like a {{thousand}} needles darting through my leg." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not--if {{he thought}} he would get a reward?" [...] came from Nat Potts, the {{youngest}} of the trio. [...] "One <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> Macklin is crazy to make money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> I'll {{never forget}} this buffalo hunt," [...] he murmured {{as he turned}} in. [...] "It's not proving {{as much fun as}} I thought it would be." ...|$|E
5000|$|The realis mood (...) is {{used for}} actual {{events of the past}} or present, i.e. <b>things</b> that <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> to have happened, <b>things</b> that <b>are</b> [...] "real". Accordingly, the irrealis (...) mood {{describes}} anticipated events in the future, or events that the speaker wishes were real.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he went on}} to {{tell her}} all about it. Ida made no comment, that is after those first words, [...] "she did it on purpose," [...] which burst from her in astonishment. She felt, and he felt too, that the {{question}} as to how that gun went off was one which was best left uninquired into by them. No doubt if the man died there would be an inquest, and the whole matter would be investigated. Meanwhile one <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain,</b> Edward Cossey, whom she was engaged to, was shot and likely to die.|$|R
6000|$|You {{answer with}} {{incredible}} <b>things.</b> It <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> [...] That there is one,--though {{it may be}} but one-- [...] Believes in God and in some heaven and hell-- [...] In all those things we put into our prayers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Home!" [...] cried Shep. [...] "Don't {{you dare}} to mention such a thing. No, I {{am not going}} home, boys. But one <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> we can't stay at Lake Cameron." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, one <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> Wilcox; we {{must find}} out {{if any of them}} are still alive, and if so we must try and {{get them out of the}} Malays’ hands.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> {{at least}} one of yer enemies is a-watching of us," [...] was the old miner's comment. [...] "We'll keep behind shelter after this." [...] And they did.|$|E
60|$|C. Wal. Don't quote Scripture here, sir, {{especially}} in that gross literal way! The new lights here have {{taught us that}} Scripture's saying one <b>thing,</b> <b>is</b> a <b>certain</b> proof that it means another. Except, by the bye, in one text.|$|R
6000|$|But let {{his heart}} be touched ever so much, one <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain.</b> It {{could not be}} {{permitted}} that she should marry Adolphe. To that view of the matter he had given in his unrestricted adhesion; nor could he by any means withdraw it without losing altogether his position {{in the establishment of}} Madame Bauche. Nor indeed did his conscience tell him that such a marriage should be permitted. That would be too much. If every pretty girl were allowed to marry the first young man that might fall in love with her, what would the world come to? ...|$|R
60|$|One <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain.</b> The family honour {{was in his}} hands. Anything {{that was}} to be done to keep Maud away from the {{intruder}} must be done by himself. Reggie was hopeless: he was capable, as far as Percy could see, of escorting Maud to the fellow's door in his own car and leaving her on the threshold with his blessing. As for Lord Marshmoreton, roses and the family history took up so much of his time that he could not be counted on for anything but moral support. He, Percy, must do the active work.|$|R
