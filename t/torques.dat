5|$|Newton's Third Law of Motion {{requires}} that all objects exerting <b>torques</b> themselves experience equal and opposite <b>torques,</b> and therefore also directly implies {{the conservation of}} angular momentum for closed systems that experience rotations and revolutions through the action of internal <b>torques.</b>|$|E
5|$|Also, because real tires have {{a finite}} contact patch {{with the road}} surface that can {{generate}} a scrub torque, and when in a turn, can experience some side slipping as they roll, they can generate <b>torques</b> about an axis normal to {{the plane of the}} contact patch.|$|E

It was found that tire slip and frame flex are not important for the lateral dynamics of the bicycle in the speed range up to 6 m/s. The idealized bike model {{used to calculate the}} eigenvalues shown here does not incorporate any of the <b>torques</b> that real tires can generate, and so tire interaction with the pavement cannot prevent the capsize mode from becoming unstable at high speeds, as Wilson and Cossalter suggest happens in the real world.|$|E
50|$|Comparing engines on the dynamometer, {{a typical}} even-fire V6 shows {{instantaneous}} <b>torque</b> peaks of 150% above mean <b>torque</b> and valleys of 125% below mean <b>torque,</b> {{with a small}} amount of negative <b>torque</b> (engine <b>torque</b> reversals) between power strokes. On the other hand, a typical four-cylinder engine shows peaks of nearly 300% above mean <b>torque</b> and valleys of 200% below mean <b>torque,</b> with 100% negative <b>torque</b> being delivered between strokes.|$|R

5|$|The Moon {{may have}} {{dramatically}} affected {{the development of}} life by moderating the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.

5|$|The {{combination}} of these two opposite <b>torques</b> creates a resulting yaw torque on the front wheel, and its direction {{is a function of}} the side-slip angle of the tire, the angle between the actual path of the tire and the direction it is pointing, and the camber angle of the tire (the angle that the tire leans from the vertical). The result of this torque is often the suppression of the inversion speed predicted by rigid wheel models described above in the section on steady-state turning.|$|E

On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding.

The analysis used computer simulations to show that both the magnitude and direction of tilt {{can be explained by the}} gravitational <b>torques</b> exerted by Planet Nine on the other planets over the lifetime of the Solar System.

5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply <b>torques</b> between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The unique {{performance}} {{features of}} harmonic drives, such as highs gear ratios and high <b>torque</b> capacities in a compact geometry, justify their widespread industrial application especially in many electrically actuated robot manipulators. In many robotic control strategies {{it is assumed}} that the actuator is acting as a <b>torque</b> source, and in order to implement such algorithms it is necessary to accurately measure the transmitted <b>torque</b> by the harmonic drive. In this paper a built-in <b>torque</b> sensor for harmonic drive systems is developed and examined in detail, in which strain-gauges are directly mounted on the harmonic drive flexspline. To minimize sensing inaccuracy, four Rosette strain gauges are used employing an accurate positioning method. To cancel the <b>torque</b> ripples, the oscillation observed on the measured <b>torque</b> and caused mainly by gear teeth meshing, Kalman filter estimation is used. A simple fourth order harmonic oscillator proved to accurately model the <b>torque</b> ripples. Moreover, the error model is extended to incorporate any misalignment <b>torque.</b> By on line implementation of the Kalman filter, {{it has been shown that}} this method is a fast and accurate way to filter <b>torque</b> ripples and misalignment <b>torque.</b> Hence, the intelligent built-in <b>torque</b> sensor is a viable and economical way to measure the harmonic drive transmitted <b>torque</b> and to employ that for <b>torque</b> feedback strategies.

30|$|In {{terms of}} the {{equipment}} for bolting, {{there are two main}} methods for increasing bolt’s prestress (Kang and Wang 2007): one is to increase the bolt-nut tightening torque; the second is to use a bolt tensioning device, which is similar to imposing large prestresses on anchor bolts. The methods for improving bolt-nut tightening <b>torque</b> include: (1) high <b>torque</b> jumbolter. With a high <b>torque</b> jumbolter, it can not only increase the bolt tightening <b>torque,</b> but also achieve an integration of bolt installation to improve installation speed.

The rated <b>torque</b> of a single jumbolter in China is not greater than 150  N m, and unable to meet the requirement of high tightening <b>torque</b> of the bolt. (2) <b>Torque</b> multiplier. In order to improve the installation <b>torque</b> of the jumbolter, a <b>torque</b> multiplier can be used on the jumbolter to multiply the nut tightening <b>torque</b> when installing bolt. (3) <b>Torque</b> wrench. Using a large <b>torque</b> preload wrench to tighten the bolts and nuts is an effective way to improve the prestress of anchor bolts.|$|R
