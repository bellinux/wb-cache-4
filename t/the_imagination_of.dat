5|$|The {{second half}} of the 19th century has often been called the Heroic Age of polar exploration.

At a time when the news from all fronts was uniformly bad, MacArthur became a living symbol of Allied resistance to the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|In Iceland, {{where the}} kings' sagas {{continued}} to be copied and studied, the battle exercised <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> <b>of</b> several poets. A 15th century rímur cycle, Svöldrar rímur, chronicles the battle in verse, largely following the account of Oddr Snorrason. Two more rímur cycles on the same topic were composed in the 18th century, {{one of which is}} preserved. In the 19th century, the popular poet Sigurður Breiðfjörð composed yet another rímur cycle on the battle, based on the account in Mesta.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} well known and for many years {{respected}} books about Wyatt Earp was the book I Married Wyatt Earp, originally credited as a factual memoir by Josephine Marcus Earp. Published in 1976, it was edited by amateur historian Glenn Boyer, and published by the respected University of Arizona Press. It was immensely popular for many years, capturing <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> <b>of</b> people {{with an interest in}} western history, studied in classrooms, cited by scholars, and relied upon as factual by filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|The {{charting}} and {{conquest of}} this new world made real regions previously only idealised in <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> <b>of</b> artists and poets. At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began to slip from the grasp of thinkers into the realms of mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional Utopian representation, as exemplified by the writings of Thomas More (1478–1535).|$|E

5|$|Although Apollonius {{wrote his}} poem in the 3rd century BC, the {{composition}} of the story of the Argonauts is earlier than Odyssey, which shows familiarity with the exploits of Jason (the wandering of Odysseus may have been partly founded on it). In ancient times the expedition was regarded as a historical fact, an incident in the opening up of the Black Sea to Greek commerce and colonization. It was also extremely popular, forming a cycle to which a number of local legends became attached. The story of Medea, in particular, caught <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> <b>of</b> the tragic poets.|$|E
5|$|In April 1878, L'Estrange reappeared on the Australian {{scene with}} a new {{performance}} – gas ballooning. The first balloon ascent in Australia {{had been made in}} Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. The idea that people could be lifted from the ground to fly and return safely fired <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> <b>of</b> the public, and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt the very real chance of disaster and injury added to the crowd's keen interest, as mishaps were not uncommon.|$|E
5|$|Just as the {{new design}} was {{approaching}} finalisation, the LMS marketing department created a problem that was close to being insurmountable. The London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) had recently introduced its streamlined Class A4 locomotive which had captured <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> <b>of</b> the public, and the marketing department persuaded the board that the LMS's new locomotives should be streamlined too. This was problematic in that the new design was so large that it only just conformed to the maximum loading gauge for the main line; moreover, it was sufficiently heavy that {{it was close to}} the Civil Engineer's maximum weight limit. Nevertheless, Coleman managed to design a streamlined steel casing that hugged the locomotive so tightly that it could still meet the loading gauge. The casing weighed some , but Coleman managed to save an equivalent weight in the locomotive itself.|$|E

5|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} Christianity did not curb {{the popularity of}} the myths. With the rediscovery of classical antiquity in the Renaissance, the poetry of Ovid became a major influence on <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> <b>of</b> poets, dramatists, musicians and artists.* L. Burn, Greek Myths, 75 From the early years of Renaissance, artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, portrayed the Pagan subjects of Greek mythology alongside more conventional Christian themes. Through the medium of Latin and the works of Ovid, Greek myth influenced medieval and Renaissance poets such as Petrarch, Boccaccio and Dante in Italy.|$|E
5|$|In {{search of}} a fair trial, Carrouges {{traveled}} to Paris {{to appeal to the}} King himself. Knowing that his case depended solely on his wife's testimony and was therefore weak, Carrouges developed a plan: Instead of proceeding with a normal criminal trial, Carrouges would challenge Le Gris to a judicial duel, the survivor of which would thus have been deemed by God to have been the rightful claimant. Such trials-by-combat, once common in France, were rare by 1386 and the chance of one being permitted by the King unlikely. Nevertheless, Carrouges saw this scheme as his best option of procuring justice and redeeming his wife's reputation. A few days after his arrival in Paris, Carrouges was presented to the King at the Château de Vincennes {{in order to make the}} first official appeal in the lengthy trial process. In doing so, he captured <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> <b>of</b> the French court, which later become so fascinated with the Carrouges-Le Gris trial that it would shape its schedule around watching the culminating combat.|$|E
5|$|No more of {{the tale}} is {{recorded}} until about 1165 when copies of what was certainly a forged Letter of Prester John started spreading throughout Europe. An epistolary wonder tale with parallels suggesting its author knew the Romance of Alexander and the above-mentioned Acts of Thomas, the Letter was supposedly written to the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Comnenus (1143–1180) by Prester John, descendant {{of one of the}} Three Magi and King of India. The many marvels of richness and magic it contained captured <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> <b>of</b> Europeans, and it was translated into numerous languages, including Hebrew. It circulated in ever more embellished form for centuries in manuscripts, a hundred examples of which still exist. The invention of printing perpetuated the letter's popularity in printed form; it was still current in popular culture during the period of European exploration. Part of the letter's essence was that a lost kingdom of Nestorian Christians still existed in the vastnesses of Central Asia.|$|E

5|$|The final {{was played}} at the Estadio Centenario on 30 July. Feelings ran high around the La Plata Basin as the Argentine {{supporters}} crossed the river with the war cry Victoria o muerte ("victory or death"), dispelling any uncertainty {{as to whether the}} tournament had captured <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> <b>of</b> the public. The ten boats earmarked to carry Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo proved inadequate, and any number of assorted craft attempted the crossing. An estimated 10–15,000 Argentinians made the trip, but the port at Montevideo was so overwhelmed that many did not even make landfall before kick-off, let alone reach the stadium. At the stadium, supporters were searched for weapons. The gates were opened at eight o'clock, six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full, the official attendance 93,000. A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as the teams failed to agree on who should provide the match ball, forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second. Uruguay made one change from their semi-final line-up. Castro replaced Anselmo, who missed out due to illness. Monti played for Argentina despite receiving death threats {{on the eve of the}} match. The referee was Belgian John Langenus, who only agreed to officiate a few hours before the game, having sought assurances for his safety. One of his requests was for a boat to be ready at the harbour within one hour of the final whistle, in case he needed to make a quick escape.|$|E
