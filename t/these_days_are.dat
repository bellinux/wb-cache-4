25|$|San Miguel Xicalco {{is located}} {{just off the}} Mexico City-Cuernavaca highway. Xicalco comes from Nahuatl and means “house of grass” or “house of plants.” San Miguel is {{in honor of the}} Archangel Michael, the patron saint, who is said to have {{appeared}} here. The center of the small community is a chapel from the 17th century, which has one nave, of three sections and a presbytery. The image of Michael inside is made of cornstalk paste. Michael is honored twice a year here, on 8 May, when he is said to have appeared and on 29 September, his usual feast day. <b>These</b> <b>days</b> <b>are</b> traditionally celebrated with mole rojo (red mole sauce), tamales, Chinelos, other indigenous and folk dance as well as traditional music. Another story from the area is that during the Mexican Revolution, Zapatista troops took control of the small church to use as a headquarters. Today, there is a small cannon which {{is said to have been}} left by these troops.|$|E
500|$|An {{enhanced}} risk day {{indicates that there}} is a greater threat for severe weather than that which would be indicated by a slight risk, but conditions are not adequate for the development of widespread significant severe weather to necessitate a moderate category.

500|$|Seeking to {{cut costs}} during the Recession of 1937, the newspaper's {{management}} decided to consolidate its foreign coverage under Laurence Hills, who had been appointed editor of the Paris Herald by Frank Munsey in 1920 and kept the paper profitable. [...] But Hills had fascist sympathies—the Paris Herald was alone among American newspapers in having [...] "ad columns sprout(ing) with swastikas and fasces—and {{was more interested in}} cutting costs than producing journalism. [...] "It is no longer the desire even to attempt to run parallel with The New York Times in special dispatches from Europe," [...] Hills wrote in a memo to the Herald Tribunes foreign bureaus in late 1937. [...] "Crisp cables of human interest or humorous type cables are greatly appreciated. [...] Big beats in Europe <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>are</b> not very likely."

500|$|McClure's most {{prominent}} role {{occurs in the}} seventh-season episode [...] "A Fish Called Selma". In the episode, McClure begins a relationship with Selma Bouvier, whom he meets when she gives him an eye test at the Department of Motor Vehicles. The relationship revives his career, leading him to star in Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off!, a stage musical version of the film Planet of the Apes. To further boost McClure's career, McClure's agent suggests that he get married. Unaware of McClure's motivation, Selma accepts his proposal, and moves into McClure's house, a Modernist building which resembles the Chemosphere. At his bachelor party, a drunken McClure tells Homer Simpson that the marriage is just a sham to help his career. Homer says nothing at the wedding, but later offhandedly mentions McClure's admission to Marge, who then informs her sister. Selma decides to remain with McClure anyway, but she becomes disturbed when McClure's agent advises the pair {{to have a child}} (since [...] "all the big parts <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>are</b> going to family men"). Having a child will secure McClure's casting as McBain's sidekick in McBain IV: Fatal Discharge, but Selma is unwilling to bring a child into a loveless relationship and decides to leave McClure. McClure ultimately gets the role, but turns it down in order to direct and star in his own pet project, a 20th Century Fox film called The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel.|$|E

2500|$|The Yuledays are {{the days}} that signify {{the end of an}} old year and the {{beginning}} of a new one, so 2 Yule is the first day of the year. The Lithedays are the three days in the middle of the year, 1 Lithe, Mid-year's Day, and 2 Lithe. In leap years (every fourth year except centennial years) a day is added after Mid-year's Day called Overlithe. [...] All <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>are</b> placed outside of any month. <b>These</b> <b>days</b> <b>are</b> primarily holidays and feast days. Mid-year's Day is meant to correspond to the summer solstice, which Tolkien describes as being 10 days earlier than the middle day of our year. However, since then the summer solstice has shifted slightly so it falls on a different date now, rendering the difference between Mid-year's Day and the middle day of our year eleven days, instead of ten.|$|E

2500|$|This {{redemption}} {{ceremony is}} performed when {{at least thirty}} days have passed since the child's birth. [...] If the 31st day falls on Shabbat or a festival, the redemption is delayed, because any sort of business transaction is not allowed on those days.

[...] While the redemption could be performed immediately after dark on the 31st night, it is usually done the next day; but if the 31st day is a fast day, it is done the previous night, {{so that it can}} be accompanied by a festive meal. [...] It is also possible to hold the ceremony on the 30th day itself, if it will be impossible to perform it the next day, so long as at least one Synodic month (29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 2.9 seconds) has passed since the moment of birth.|$|E
2500|$|When Sebastian {{decided to}} record {{an album of}} Memphis soul {{classics}} it was suggested by Universal Music Publishing that Steve Cropper should be contacted {{to see if he}} would like to be involved. Cropper was interested, and he arranged for the other two members of The Mgs Donald 'Duck' Dunn and Steve Potts to participate. He also called in Lester Snell, who is a mainstay Memphis organ/keyboard player who has worked with artists including Eddie Floyd, David Porter and Isaac Hayes. The Memphis Album was recorded live on analogue tape at Ardent Studios Memphis in August 2007. The recording engineer Curry Weber explained the reason for this on AllMemphisMusic, an online Memphis radio station, [...] "Going to tape is just such a richer and warmer tone when you hit it first of all. Not a lot of guys <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>are</b> talented enough to go to tape, cause it's so definitive and destructive.

2500|$|When the {{landlord}} feels the beer has settled, {{and they are}} ready to serve it, they will knock a soft spile into the shive {{on the side of the}} cask. The major difference in appearance between a keg and a cask is the shive. A keg does not have a shive on the side. The majority of casks <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>are</b> metal, and look similar to a keg, but with the rounded traditional barrel shape (kegs are often straight-sided). Even though there are still some wooden casks around, these are rare; in fact there are more plastic casks around than wooden ones. Plastic casks are increasing in popularity because they are cheaper to buy and lighter to carry. Though they don't last as long, they are also less likely to be stolen as they have no melt-down value. Beer casks come in a number of sizes, but by far the most common in the pub trade are those of 9 gallons (72 pints or roughly 41 litres) which is known as a Firkin and 18 gallons (144 pints or roughly 83 litres) known as a Kilderkin.
