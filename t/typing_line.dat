The high (12) and low (11) lines were developed from a control egg <b>type</b> (<b>line</b> 13) wild color plumage stock 07, from Poultry Breeding Station in Ivanka at Danube (Slovakia) that was maintained without conscious selection. The results of selected lines were compared to this one from unselected <b>lines,</b> egg <b>type</b> (<b>line</b> 13, n= 15) and meat <b>type</b> (<b>line</b> 8, n= 15), to study productive performance (growth and carcass weight) as well as meat quality traits (intramuscular collagen properties, fatty and cholesterol content). The birds were grown up to 35 days of age. Quails were fed ad libitum with commercial diets according to their ages. Animals had free access to water during the experiment. The body weight of the quails was controlled every week (from week 1 to 5). At the slaughter (at avg. weight of 104. 0, 107. 7, 110. 6 g vs 209. 3 g for lines 11, 12, 13 vs 8, respectively; P< 0. 05) the hot carcass weight was recorded and dressing percentage was calculated. Pectoralis superficialis muscles {{were removed from the}} carcasses to assess intramuscular collagen (IMC) properties (collagen and crosslink concentrations), intramuscular lipid and cholesterol contents. Growth and slaughter performance, intramuscular fat percentage and IMC properties of Pectoralis superficialis were not different between the birds selected for low (line 11) and high (line 12) yolk cholesterol content and were also found to be similar between the quails of egg type and those selected for yolk cholesterol content (lines 11 and 12). Compared to the birds of egg <b>type</b> <b>line</b> and those selected for yolk cholesterol content, the quails of meat type had higher growth and carcass traits (P< 0. 05), while meat quality traits were found to be similar. The meat of the quails selected for low cholesterol in the egg yolk (line 11) had lower (P< 0. 05) cholesterol (- 35. 9 %) than that of the birds characterized by high cholesterol in the egg yolk (line 12). In conclusion, divergent selection for yolk cholesterol content did not significantly influence growth and slaughter traits, intramuscular fat and IMC properties of Japanese quail, while it affected the amount of cholesterol in meat. The quails of meat type showed the highest growth and slaughter traits...|$|R
40|$|In the {{presence}} of selection and mutation, the genealogy of a given sample configuration can be described by two classes of ancestral processes, namely the coalescent-in-a-random-background model of Kaplan et al. (1988) and the dual process with <b>typed</b> <b>lines</b> of Etheridge and Griffiths (2009). These two processes {{are based on the}} same forwards population genetics model. However, in the former model, selection is reflected in the ancestral frequencies in the population, while in the latter model, there are branching events that generate virtual ancestral lines. We simulate the dual processes with <b>typed</b> <b>lines</b> and derive the limits of the two ancestral processes under strong selection and under selection-mutation balance to address the question of to what extent the genealogy is distorted. The two ancestral processes generate the same limiting genealogy. In a two-allele population under strong selection, the disfavoured individuals in the sample are instantaneously converted to a random number of favoured individuals, and the limiting genealogy is governed by the usual Kingman’s coalescent. Under selection-mutation balance, all disfavoured individuals in the sample are instantaneously converted to the favoured type, and the limiting genealogy is determined by a time-changed Kingman’s coalescent. The proofs of these limiting processes are based on the convergence result of Mohle (1998, Lemma 1). The studies of selection-mutation balance are then extended to an additive selection model, where each individual is composed of L diallelic loci. In the corresponding dual process with <b>typed</b> <b>lines,</b> the evolution of the virtual lines on a faster timescale can be approximated by a deterministic process, while the evolution of the real lines is independent of the virtual lines. The structure in the limiting genealogy collapses to Kingman’s coalescent. We also let L tend to infinity, and obtain a full description of the limiting genealogy in the background selection model.

Using a Genetic Algorithm with Sex Differentiation under the concept of quality loss, its model in MCM is built.

Finally, the algorithm was integrated in the model and a petal <b>type</b> production <b>line</b> layout was implemented in a QUEST based simulation system. ...|$|R
