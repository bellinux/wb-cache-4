6000|$|The prospectus-writer {{went on to}} {{say that}} some gentlemen, whose names were, for obvious reasons, not brought before the public (at which Mr. Warrington began to laugh again), had {{determined}} to bring forward a journal, of which the principles were so-and-so.

60|$|Now, {{the truth}} is, Lillie {{would have been}} quite {{astonished}} to have been told this. She, and many other women, suppose that <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>their</b> husbands, when, unfortunately, they have not {{the beginning of an}} idea what love is. Let me explain it to you, my dear lady. Loving to be admired by a man, loving to be petted by him, loving to be caressed by him, and loving to be praised by him, is not loving a man. All these may be when a woman has no power of loving at all,--they may all be simply because she loves herself, and loves to be flattered, praised, caressed, coaxed; as a cat likes to be coaxed and stroked, and fed with cream, and have a warm corner.|$|E

60|$|Their origin is uncertain, but {{supposed}} to be very ancient, soon after the Mahommedan conquest. They now claim a divine original, and are {{supposed to}} have supernatural powers, and to be the emissaries of the divinity, like the wolf, the tiger, and the bear. It is only lately that they have swarmed so prodigiously,--seven original gangs having migrated from Delhi to the Gangetic provinces about 200 years ago, and from these all the rest have sprung. Many belong to the most amiable, intelligent, and respectable classes of the lower and even middle ranks: <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>their</b> profession, regard murder as sport, and are never haunted with dreams, or troubled with pangs of conscience during hours of solitude, or in the last moments of life.

60|$|Perhaps all the nieces were {{relieved}} {{to hear this}} verdict, for already <b>they</b> <b>loved</b> <b>their</b> beautiful gifts. That evening the Stanton girls and their Aunt Jane received their parcels, being fully as much surprised as the others had been, and their boxes also contained pearls.

6000|$|Next to {{the love}} of parents for their children, the strongest instinct, both natural and moral, that exists in man, is {{the love of}} his country: an instinct, indeed, which extends even to the brute creation. All creatures love their offspring; next to that <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>their</b> homes: they have a fondness for the place where they have been bred, for the habitations they have dwelt in, for the stalls in which they have been fed, the {{pastures}} they have browsed in, and the wilds in which they have roamed. We all know that the natal soil has a sweetness in it beyond the harmony of verse. This instinct, I say, that binds all creatures to their country, never becomes inert in us, nor ever suffers us to want a memory of it. Those, therefore, who seek to fly their country can only wish to fly from oppression: and what other proof can you want of this oppression, when, as a witness has told you, Colonel Hannay was obliged to put bars and guards to confine the inhabitants within the country? ...|$|E

(2 Thess 2:10-12) The poor ignorant world miss of heaven, because they stop their ears against convictions, and refuse to come when God calls. [...] "Because I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded, but ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof; I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh--as desolation, and your destruction--as a whirlwind, when distress and anguish cometh upon you; then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me."

The day is now when they must give their lives for true fame, and for beneficent power: and the work is near every one of you--close beside you--the means of it even thrust into your hands. The people are crying to you for command, and you stand there at pause, and silent. You think they don't want to be commanded; try them; determine what is needful for them--honorable for them; show it them, promise to bring them to it, and they will follow you through fire. [...] "Govern us," [...] they cry with one heart, though many minds. They can be governed still, these English; they are men still; not gnats, nor serpents. <b>They</b> <b>love</b> <b>their</b> old ways yet, and their old masters, and their old land.

5000|$|It {{has been}} thought that Otho's suicide was {{committed}} {{in order to}} steer his country from the path to civil war. Just as {{he had come to}} power, many Romans learned to respect Otho in his death. Few could believe that a renowned former companion of Nero had chosen such an honourable end. Tacitus wrote that some of the soldiers committed suicide beside his funeral pyre [...] "because <b>they</b> <b>loved</b> <b>their</b> emperor and wished to share his glory." ...|$|R

[...] The existence of a slave dungeon {{in the basement of}} Bel Air, however, belies this romanticized view of slave life.|$|R
60|$|A {{distinguished}} living critic, born {{south of}} the Tweed, once whispered in confidence to a friend that {{he believed that the}} Scotch knew really very little about their own national literature. He quite admitted that <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>their</b> 'Robbie Burns' and their 'Sir Walter' with a patriotic enthusiasm that makes them extremely severe upon any unfortunate southron who ventures to praise either in their presence, but he claimed that the works of such great national poets as Dunbar, Henryson and Sir David Lyndsay are sealed books to the majority of the reading public in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow, and that few Scotch people have any idea of the wonderful outburst of poetry that took place in their country during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, {{at a time when there}} was little corresponding development in England. Whether this terrible accusation be absolutely true, or not, it is needless to discuss at present. It is probable that the archaism of language alone will always prevent a poet like Dunbar from being popular in the ordinary acceptation of the word. Professor Veitch's book, however, shows that there are some, at any rate, in the 'land o' cakes' who can admire and appreciate their marvellous early singers, and whose admiration for The Lord of the Isles and the verses To a Mountain Daisy does not blind them to the exquisite beauties of The Testament of Cresseid, The Thistle and the Rose, and the Dialog betwix Experience and ane Courteour.|$|E
6000|$|And this want {{of faith}} in a living God lies {{at the bottom of}} another objection. We are to keep murderers alive in order to convert and {{instruct}} and amend them. The answer is, We shall be most happy to amend anybody of any fault, however great: but the experience of ages is that murderers are past mending; that the fact of a man's murdering another is a plain proof that he has no moral sense, and has become simply a brute animal Our duty is to punish not to amend, and to say to the murderer, [...] "If you can be amended; God will amend you, and so have mercy on your soul. God must amend you, if you are to be amended. If God cannot amend you, we cannot. If God will not amend you, certainly we cannot force Him to do so, if we kept you alive for a thousand years." [...] That would seem reasonable, as well as reverent and faithful to God. But men now-a-days fancy that <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>their</b> fellow creatures far better than God loves them, and can deal far more wisely and lovingly with them than God is willing to deal. Of these objections I take little heed. I look on them as merely loose cant, which does not quite understand the meaning of its own words, and I trust to sound, hard, English common sense to put them aside.|$|E
6000|$|Hooted {{away from}} the hustings, and the public places whence the rival {{candidates}} addressed the free and independent electors, this wretched and persecuted Sir Barnes invited his friends and supporters {{to meet him at}} the Athenaeum Room--scene of his previous eloquent performances. But, though this apartment was defended by tickets, the people burst into it; and Nemesis, {{in the shape of the}} persevering factory-man, appeared before the scared Sir Barnes and his puzzled committee. The man stood up and bearded the pale Baronet. He had a good cause, and was in truth a far better master of debate than our banking friend, being a great speaker amongst his brother-operatives, by whom political questions are discussed, and the conduct of political men examined, with a ceaseless interest and with an ardour and eloquence which are often unknown in what is called superior society. This man and his friends round about him fiercely silenced the clamour of [...] "Turn him out," [...] with which his first appearance was assailed by Sir Barnes's hangers-on. He said, in the name of justice he would speak up; if they were fathers of families and loved their wives and daughters he dared them to refuse him a hearing. Did <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>their</b> wives and their children? it was a shame that they should take such a man as that yonder for their representative in Parliament. But the greatest sensation he made was when, in the middle of his speech, after inveighing against Barnes's cruelty and parental ingratitude, he asked, [...] "Where were Barnes's children?" [...] and actually thrust forward two, to the amazement of the committee and the ghastly astonishment of the guilty Baronet himself.|$|E
