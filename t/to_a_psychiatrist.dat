25|$|Several studies {{point out}} that the {{severity}} of psychiatric symptoms could easily result in an inappropriate referral <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>psychiatrist</b> prior to the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. Consequently, undiagnosed hyperthyroidism sometimes results in inappropriate use of psychotropic medications; prompt recognition of hyperthyroidism (or hypothyroidism) through thyroid function screening is therefore recommended in the evaluation of patients with psychiatric symptoms. Naturally, the management of patients would be improved by collaboration between an endocrinologist and a psychiatrist.|$|E

25|$|In October 1938, Straffen was {{referred}} to a child guidance clinic for stealing and truancy. In June 1939, he first came before a juvenile court for stealing a purse from a girl and was given two years probation. His probation officer found that Straffen {{did not understand the}} difference between right and wrong, or the meaning of probation. The family was living in crowded lodgings at the time, and Straffen's mother had no time to help, so the probation officer took the boy <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>psychiatrist.</b> As a result, Straffen was certified as a mental defective under the Mental Deficiency Act 1927. A report was compiled on him in 1940 which gave his Intelligence Quotient as 58 and placed his mental age at six. From June 1940, the local council sent him to a residential school for mentally defective children, St Joseph's School in Sambourne.|$|E
25|$|Outpatient {{treatment}} involves periodic visits <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>psychiatrist</b> for consultation {{in his or}} her office, or at a community-based outpatient clinic. Initial appointments, {{at which}} the psychiatrist conducts a psychiatric assessment or evaluation of the patient, are typically 45 to 75 minutes in length. Follow-up appointments are generally shorter in duration, i.e., 15 to 30 minutes, with a focus on making medication adjustments, reviewing potential medication interactions, considering the impact of other medical disorders on the patient's mental and emotional functioning, and counseling patients regarding changes they might make to facilitate healing and remission of symptoms (e.g., exercise, cognitive therapy techniques, sleep hygiene—to name just a few). The frequency with which a psychiatrist sees people in treatment varies widely, from once a week to twice a year, depending on the type, severity and stability of each person's condition, and depending on what the clinician and patient decide would be best.|$|E
