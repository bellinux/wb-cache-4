40|$|THE ASSESSMENT OF INFLUENCE OF ZINC IONS AND ECHINACEA PURPUREA (L.) MOENCH FOR MICE INTOXICATED BY CADMIUM IONS Abstract Background. Cadmium (Cd), a {{well-known}} environmental hazard, exerts {{a number of}} toxic effects in organism. It disturbs the activity of biochemical systems of cells. Accumulation of cadmium depends {{on the amount of}} essential trace elements, including zinc. Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench (EP) can modify its influence. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the influence of ions of cadmium, zinc, and EP on organism in experimental model of mice. The objectives of the scientific work were as follows: 1. To evaluate the accumulation of cadmium in the internal organs of experimental mice after acute and chronic intraperitoneal and per oral intoxication. 2. To assess morphological changes in liver tissue, mitotic and apoptotic activity of liver cells after the intoxication by cadmium ions of different duration and dose. 3. To assess the effect of zinc ions to the accumulation of cadmium in the internal organs and to the mitotic and apoptotic activity of liver cells in the organism of mice intoxicated by cadmium. 4. To evaluate the effect of EP to accumulation of cadmium in internal organs, mitotic and apoptotic activity of liver cells after the chronic intraperitoneal and per oral intoxication by cadmium ions. The scientific novelty of the study. This work makes our knowledge about mechanisms and outcomes of acute and chronic exposure to cadmium deeper. The integrated investigations exhibit not only the dynamics of cadmium accumulation in blood and tissues, but also reveal the morphological changes in livers cells and the metal effect to processes of mitosis and apoptosis. It is found that zinc ions effectively change accumulation of cadmium ions in blood and tissues and decrease harmful effect to livers cells. This work demonstrated for the first time that it was necessary to determine not only the quantity of absorbed toxic metals, but also the metabolism of these elements in organism, the morphological changes, mitotic and apoptotic activity of cells. The influence of Echinacea as immunomodulator changing the effect of heavy metals was investigated. The practical benefit. The intake of zinc and preparations of EP would decrease cadmium accumulation and its toxic effect especially for people highly exposed to cadmium. This work is valuable for further research investigating harmful effects of heavy metals in molecular mechanisms of cells. Materials and methods: Experiments were carried out on the white laboratory mice of 20 - 25 g weight. Mice were i. p. injected and sipped with ZnSO 4 CdCl 2 and Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench extract following various protocols. The concentration of Cd and Zn in blood and tissue specimens taken from liver, kidneys, heart, spleen, skeletal muscle was determined using an electrothermal graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer Perkin-Elmer/Zeeman 3030. The number of positively stained (TUNEL+) nuclei of liver cells was determined by counting in randomly selected 10 histological fields per section. Extraction and electrophoresis of DNA from liver tissue was carried out and analysis of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities with analyser Monarch was performed. Results: After single CdCl 2 (0. 5 LD 50) intoxication during 24 hours Cd concentration statistically significantly increased in blood and all explored organs though most of this metal accumulates in liver. Mitotic and apoptotic indexes (MI, AI) of the liver cells were significantly increased 2 h and 8 h after Cd injection, however 24 h after injection they decreased and remained the same as of control group mice. After 24 hours passed intoxication by cadmium foci of liver necrosis were detected. These data were concordant with statistically significant increasing of AST and ALT in mice blood. Group of experiments was performed to evaluate Zn 2 + influence on the concentration of Cd 2 + in blood and organs. ZnSO 4 solution (Zn 2 + 3. 12 mg/ 1 kg body mass) was injected 20 min. before intoxication with subtoxic CdCl 2 dose (Cd 2 + 1. 6 mg/ 1 kg body mass). When Zn 2 + pretreatment was applied, Cd 2 + concentration in mice blood and heart was higher during all testing time comparing with mice group injected with Cd 2 + only. Zn premedication declined MI of liver cells of mice intoxicated with Cd until the level of control group. MI was the same in group of mice injected with Zn 2 + only and controls. After periodical CdCl 2 (0. 05 LD 50) i. p. injections for 6 weeks Cd concentration in blood and some organs of mice were statistically significantly higher in comparison with control group, though most of this metal accumulates in kidney. After chronic i. p. Cd influence various morphologic changes in liver tissue have been noticed. Inflammatory cell clusters and thick liver capsule infiltrated by inflammatory cells were found in mice liver. Number of mitotic and apoptotic liver cells significantly increased as compared with control group. Zn 2 + concentration after ZnSO 4 i. p injection for 6 weeks before Cd 2 + intoxication (Zn 2 + 0. 535 mg/ 1 kg body mass and Cd 2 + 0. 16 mg/ 1 kg body mass) in blood and skeletal muscle was significantly lower, than after CdCl 2 injections only, but that in liver, kidney, spleen and heart was slightly higher. Cd 2 + concentration under Zn 2 + influence was slightly higher in liver, but lower in other explored organs. Injected Zn 2 + didn’t increase mitotic activity of liver cells but was suppressing under Cd 2 + influence increased mitotic activity of liver cells. The same tendency was observed after evaluating results of apoptotic activity. After exploring Cd 2 + concentration in blood and some organs of mice intoxicated with CdCl 2 and two different EP concentrations for 6 weeks we found, that in groups received both EP and Cd the metal concentration was higher. EP extract of higher concentration (0. 1 LD 50) increased MI and AI of liver cells, but MI was lower than mice received only CdCl 2. Per oral administration of CdCl 2 solutions for 8 weeks significantly increased Cd 2 + concentration in blood and all explored organs. Long-term intoxication per os specificity is <b>that</b> <b>major</b> <b>amount</b> of this trace metal accumulates in kidney. It was detected that Cd 2 + per os intoxication did not make influence on liver cells mitotic activity, however statistically significantly increased AI of mice liver cells. Obtained results showed, that Cd 2 + concentration in blood and all explored organs of mice after long-term per os intoxication with two different concentrations of CdCl 2 solution and EP extract was statistically significantly higher than that of CdCl 2 only group mice. EP did not make influence on mitotic and apoptotic activity of liver cells. Conclusions 1. During 24 hours after the single intraperitoneal intoxication with ions of cadmium (0. 5 LD 50) it cumulates mainly in liver tissue. The mitotic and apoptotic activity of liver cells during the first hours after the intoxication significantly increases but after 24 hours it decreases and the necrosis is observed. 2. During 24 hours after the single ZnSO 4 injection and CdCl 2 intoxication the concentration of cadmium in blood and in all investigated organs increases as compared to the mice group intoxicated with Cd 2 +only. The ions of zinc don't influence the mitosis of liver cells and normalizes the increased mitotic activity induced with Cd 2 +. 3. After the long-term (6 weeks) multiplex intraperitoneal intoxication with ions of cadmium (0. 05 LD 50) cadmium cumulates mainly in kidneys and liver. The mitotic and apoptotic activity of liver cells increases. There are foci of inflammatory cells in liver tissue. The latter morphological changes are combined with inflammatory reaction in liver capsule. 4. Long-term multiplex intraperitoneal injections of ZnSO 4 combined with intoxication by CdCl 2 leads to decrease of cadmium concentration in blood, kidneys, heart and spleen as compared to the mice group intoxicated by Cd 2 + only. Administration of Zn 2 + does not induce mitotic and apoptotic activity of liver cells. It suppresses the increased mitotic and apoptotic activity of cells of liver due to the effect of ions of cadmium. 5. Long-term injections of extract of EP (0. 1 LD 50) combined with CdCl 2 (0. 05 LD 50) leads to the significant increase of cadmium concentration in blood and all investigated organs of experimental mice. EP decreases the mitotic activity of cells of liver induced by cadmium and increases apoptotic activity of the liver cells. 6. Long-term per oral administration of cadmium leads to the significant increase of concentration of cadmium in blood and all investigated organs of experimental mice. The apoptotic activity of cells of liver increases, but the mitotic activity of cells of liver doesn't change. 7. Long-term per oral administration of extracts of EP combined with solution of CdCl 2 leads to the increase of concentration of cadmium in blood and all investigated organs as compared to the mice group intoxicated by Cd 2 +only. Per oral intake of EP extract (3. 5 ml/l) has no influence for mitotic and apoptotic activity of liver cells...|$|E

The hole was cased down to a depth of 5278 m and open to the formation below that level. All the water below 2000 m in depth standing in the borehole at the time of sampling must have entered at the 5278 -m level or below, during a prior pumping operation.

A cellular organelle fraction was separated by free flow electrophoresis and subjected to the analysis of endogenous and exogenous marker enzymes for various membrane vesicle components. Furthermore, the presence of SGLT 1 was tested by an ELISA assay using newly developed epitope-specific antibodies. Thereby it was found <b>that</b> the <b>major</b> <b>amount</b> of SGLT 1 resided in intracellular compartments and only a minor amount in apical plasma membranes. The distribution ratio between intracellular SGLT 1 and apical membrane-associated SGLT 1 was ~ 2 : 1. Further immunohistochemical investigation of SGLT 1 distribution in fixed Caco- 2 cells by epifluorescence and confocal microscopy revealed that the intracellular compartments containing SGLT 1 were associated with microtubuli. Elimination of SGLT 1 synthesis by incubation of cells with cycloheximide did not significantly reduce the size of the intracellular SGLT 1 pool. Furthermore, the half-life of SGLT 1 in Caco- 2 cells was determined to be 2. 5 d by metabolic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation. Our data suggest that most of the intracellular SGLT 1 are not transporters en route from biosynthesis to their cellular destination, but represent an intracellular reserve pool. We therefore propose that intracellular compartments containing SGLT 1 are involved in an endo-/exocytosis process, which regulates SGLT 1 abundance at the apical cell surface...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the presence of cyanide in the industrial aluminium electrolytic cell. Therefore, it was an aim of this investigation to identify the favoured regions of cyanide formation in potlining, and conduct parallel laboratory studies to determine some of the chemical factors likely to influence cyanide formation. The study was conducted in three stages. The first stage involved autopsies of cells of various ages, design and construction in detail. This was followed by extensive sampling of sections of the trenched sidewalls and cathode combined with chemical analyses of the specimens, to enable mapping of the cyanide distribution profiles. Examination of these profiles revealed <b>that</b> <b>major</b> <b>amounts</b> of cyanide were generally concentrated in the carbon sidewall region near the collector bars and to a lesser extent in the cathode near the mid-section of the pot. In particular, carbon that was heavily impregnated with metallic sodium and easily accessible to air ingress, was found to contain high concentrations of cyanide. Thus, from the cyanide profiles it: was evident that air ingress through the collector bar seals of the cathode, and sodium penetration of the carbon governed the favoured region for cyanide formation during normal pot operation. In the second stage, an examination of the kinetics of sodium cyanide formation in carbon-mix was performed in the laboratory. Metallic sodium was reacted with carbon and gaseous nitrogen over a range of temperatures. Rate plots derived from a combination of thermogravimetric and integral analysis techniques indicated that there was increasing reactivity with increase in sodium content during the initial stages of reaction. Furthermore, rate data obtained appeared to fit a second-order reaction relative to reactant sodium after the initial burst of reaction. Further laboratory investigations were conducted to establish the temperatures required for cyanide formation, and determine the susceptibility of different forms of carbon to cyanide generation. The carbon types ranged from plant derived carbon-mix through commercial preformed cathode material to high purity graphite. Whilst cyanide formation was found to readily occur in the temperature range of 500 - 600 °C in all the carbons tested, the less ordered carbon-mix was significantly more vulnerable. However, highly graphitised carbon was the least susceptible to cyanide formation within its structure. Moreover, the reaction was accelerated by the presence of small amounts of iron impurity. Laboratory tests also indicated that the predominant cyanide-containing species formed in potlinings was most likely uncomplexed sodium cyanide. The overall results obtained from laboratory studies were consistent with plant measurements and observations derived from the complex industrial situation. Conclusions drawn from this work may have implications in terms of future cell design, and the ultimate impact of spent potlinings on the surrounding environment...|$|R

40|$|Connectivity {{analysis}} {{is an important}} geomorphological and hydrologic tool {{that can be used}} to identify spaces that are prone to removal of primary sediments which are eventually assimilated into granular flows and related epiclastic processes. Studies of connectivity have been made in various areas, but to date, not in active volcanic areas, where such studies can be very useful due to the constant presence of loose volcanic material easily removed by epiclastic processes. Mobilization of loose pyroclastic sediments can trigger phenomena such as lahars, which are among the most dangerous in nature. In this study, the index of connectivity (IC) (Borselli et al. 2008) was calculated by obtaining a weight coefficient (W) combining two elements: the coefficient C related to the universal soil loss equation and the revised universal soil loss equation (USLE-RUSLE) proposed by Borselli et al. (2008) for areas with vegetation cover or crops, and the roughness index (RI) developed by Cavalli et al. (2013), which characterizes bare soil areas. Combining both methods, we propose a new joint index of connectivity (ICJ) that does not overestimate the degree of connectivity in bare areas, while areas with vegetation cover are characterized based on their wellrecognized hydrologic impedance properties. This methodology may enable better characterization in highly dynamic environments such as active volcanic areas. We also propose a new lateral hydrological efficiency index (LHEI) that increases the ability to identify watersheds <b>that</b> supply <b>major</b> <b>amounts</b> of sediment to main streams in ravines. The application of this methodology in the active volcanic area of Volcán de Colima, the most active volcano in Mexico, is of great importance, because of the constant supply of new pyroclastic material from the top of the edifice, the high dynamicity of geomorphological processes, and the widespread presence of bare soil areas consisting of loose materials easily sourced, or assimilated, into epiclastic processes...|$|R

The 0. 40 / 0. 56 micron ratio image shows that the high albedo portion of Reiner Gamma {{is surrounded by a}} 'red halo' and the 0. 95 / 0. 56 micron image indicates that Reiner Gamma exhibits a strong pyroxene absorption band. Analysis of the near-infrared spectra of various portions of the formation indicated the presence of <b>major</b> <b>amounts</b> of fresh mare basalt. Spectral mixing models demonstrate that the Reiner Gamma spectra can be reproduced by mixing <b>major</b> <b>amounts</b> of local fresh mare material (Reiner K crater) with small amounts of fresh highlands material (Oelbers A crater). No evidence was found for the presence of 'exotic' components (i. e., magnetite, free iron, cometary material). Together with photogeologic considerations, these results suggest that Reiner Gamma is quite young and is composed of a mixture of fresh highland materials with much larger quantities of local mare basalt...|$|R
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarAt the Institute are chicken embryos used {{to develop}} an {{experimental}} bioassay to investigate the Toxicological Equivalency factors (TEF) of individual dioxins and furans, and mixtures of congeners using the TEF principle. The bioassay {{should be used to}} determine the toxic potency of a mixture with dioxin related compounds, within the objective of future risk assessment of these compounds for the public health. In this study, the concentration 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD within the egg had to be determined after a single injection of 101 ng 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD, or 505 ng 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD per egg. That was achieved by analyzing the various samples, using gas chromatography, with an ECD (Electron Capture Detector). The clean up of these samples was done by a extraction of total fat with toluene, and a additional purification with active carbon (Carbosphere) and alumina. The recovery of the seventeen 2, 3, 7, 8 -chlorine substituted dioxins and furans was in a range of 60 to 120 % with a mean value of 79 %. The total amount of 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD, that was regained from the egg, 48 hours after exposure, was in a range of 17 to 123 % of the total dose injected. That revovery appeared to be dose related. It was concluded, that the manual method of exposure by a single injection is not very accurate, and needs improvement. The retention of 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD in the chicken embryo's liver was not dose related, nor affected by a injection in the air sac or egg fluid. It was between 4 and 8 % of the retrieved quantity. Furthermore, the analysis showed a retention in the yolk, of 75 % of the retrieved quantity. So, it can be seen, <b>that</b> the <b>major</b> <b>amount</b> of (lipophilic) chemical is absorbed by the yolk, that containsa rather high concentration of fat. That has its consequences for the lowest external dose possible, that will cause a detectable EROD induction, that is used as the marker for the toxic potency of the dioxin related compounds in this test system. The high absorption will may be aslo cause problems for the interpretation {{of the results of the}} chicken embryo assay for risk assessment in reference to the public health...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Full duplex (FD) radios are {{the next}} {{generation}} wireless paradigm to answer the growing demand of high capacity along with energy and spectrum efficient wireless transceivers. Given the colossal power difference between the transmit and receive signal, self-interference cancellation becomes {{one of the key}} challenge in the design of a FD radio. A model of self-interference channel is required to develop a robust cancellation mechanism. One of the key contribution of this thesis is to define the properties of the self-interference channel. Furthermore, an analog baseband cancellation mechanism for FD transceivers is also defined, which {{can be used as a}} cancellation stage before the signal goes to digital domain. The self-interference channel was measured using ultra wide-band antennas (UWB). Narrow-band measurement technique i. e., a vector network analyzer (VNA) was used for the channel measurements. Spatial resolution of 4. 3 cm was achieved. Measurements were done in variety of locations including an anechoic chamber with different antenna orientation. Antennas were mounted on an old laptop frame. Coherence bandwidth of the self-interference channel was found to be varying between 1 MHz and 10 MHz, effectively making it a frequency selective channel. The average amount of isolation was found to be around 40 dB irrespective of the antennas relative orientation. It was also observed <b>that</b> a <b>major</b> <b>amount</b> of power was transferred because of direct coupling between the antennas and this coupling was due of the frame on which antennas were mounted. Using the defined analog baseband cancellation mechanism, an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based transceiver was simulated using Matlab. The impact of different bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC), digital-to-analog converter (DAC), different training sequence length for the desired and the self-interference channel, were observed in the simulations. The simulations were performed for both 16 and 64 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Training symbols were used in front of the data frame to estimate both the desired and self-interference channel and also to set the gain of variable gain amplifiers (VGA). The least square algorithm was used for the estimates. The self-interference power was set to − 20 dBm and thermal noise floor was set to − 81. 68 dBm. It was found that a twelve bit ADC along with a sixteen bit DAC would provide a performance within 1. 5 dB of theoretical performance...|$|R
