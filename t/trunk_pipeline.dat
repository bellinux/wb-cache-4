40|$|ABSTRACT. Long term {{service of}} oil and gas trunk {{pipelines}} in corrosion and hydrogenated environments can cause a degradation of the mechanical properties and correspondingly a decrease its lifetime. Effect of service about 30 years on the impact strength and hydrogen cracking {{of oil and}} gas <b>trunk</b> <b>pipeline</b> low alloyed steels is considered. In the case of the “bottom ” section of the oil pipe being in service, it has been not possible to evaluate the impact strength, due to the deflection into cracking parallel to the pipe wall. This is a symptom of so called hydrogen induced stratification, well known degradation phenomenon of industrial pipe lines transporting the crude oil containing the higher amount of the hydrogen sulfide and the sulfide-reduction bacteria. The different susceptibility to hydrogen cracking and impact strength for the upper and bottom of parts of exploited pipe has been explained as a result of hydrogen charging and hydrogen degradation of steel during the service. The results discussed in the paper show that inspection of the surfaces of installations to find corrosion or mechanical damage alone may not be sufficient for proper evaluating risk of failure. Since material can loss its initial mechanical properties, a thorough investigation of the properties of the metal being in service under the hydrogenation conditions for the long time is suggested...|$|E

40|$|CO 2 {{emissions}} from distributed energy systems {{are expected to}} become increasingly significant, accounting for about 20 % for current global energy-related CO 2 emissions in 2030. This article reviews, assesses and compares the techno-economic performance of CO 2 capture from distributed energy systems taking into account differences in timeframe, fuel type and energy plant type. The analysis includes the energy plant, CO 2 capture and compression, and distributed transport between the capture site and a <b>trunk</b> <b>pipeline.</b> Key parameters, e. g., capacity factor, energy prices and interest rate, were normalized for the performance comparison. The {{findings of this study}} indicate that in the short-mid term (around 2020 – 2025), the energy penalty for CO 2 capture ranges between 23 % and 30 % for coal-fired plants and 10 – 28 % for natural gas-fired plants. Costs are between 30 and 140 h/tCO 2 avoided for plant scales larger than 100 MWLHV (fuel input) and 50 – 150 h/tCO 2 avoided for 10 – 100 MWLHV. In the long-term (2030 and beyond), the energy penalty for CO 2 capture might reduce to between 4 % and 9 % and the costs to around 10 – 90 h/tCO 2 avoided for plant scales larger than 100 MWLHV, 25 – 100 h/tCO 2 avoided for 10 – 100 MWLHV and 35 – 150 h/tCO 2 avoided for 10 MWLHV or smaller. CO 2 compression and distributed transport costs are significant. For a distance of 30 km, 10 h/tCO 2 transported was calculated for scales below 500 tCO 2 /day and more than 50 h/tCO 2 transported for scales below 5 tCO 2 /day (equivalent to 1 MWLHV natural gas). CO 2 compression is responsible for the largest share of these costs. CO 2 capture from distributed energy systems is not prohibitively expensive and has a significant cost reduction potential in the long term. Distributed CO 2 emission sources should also be considered for CCS, adding to the economies of scale of CO 2 transport and storage, and optimizing the deployment of CCS. & 2012 Published by Elsevier Lt...|$|E
40|$|The present article studies a {{procedure}} of calculating {{the strength of}} pipeline support constructions of the above-ground oil <b>trunk</b> <b>pipeline</b> system «Zapolyar'e — oil pumping station «Pur-pe». The calculations of the supports stress-strain state are performed {{with the use of}} computer complex Ansys v 13, which applies the finite element method. The article provides a short description of the construction of fixed, linear-sliding and free-sliding supports of the oil pipeline of above-ground routing, developed for the installation in complex climatic and geologic conditions of the far north. According to the operation specification for design — the support constructions have to maintain the resistance power and bearing capacity {{under the influence of the}} pipeline stress without sagging and considering the possible sagging of the neighboring support. The support constructions represent space structures with a complex geometry. Together with the complex geometry, contacting elements are present in the construction of the supports. There is also an interaction of the pile foundation and the nonhomogeneous foundation. The enumerated peculiarities of the construction and operating conditions of the supports considerably complicate the strength calculations by engineering methods. The method of numerical modeling (finite element method) used in the article for the analysis of the supports’ operation under the stress is widely applied at the present time for calculations of space structures with a complex geometry. For the first time, while performing the supports’ strength calculations, the article considers the mutual deformation of the support, foundation grill and pile foundation in the ground, thus making it possible to consider real operation of the construction altogether. The main development stages of the calculation model “support — pile foundation — ground” in ANSYS, calculation and testing of the static strength of the support constructions are discussed in the article. The authors provide the calculation examples of the supports' stress-strain state for unfavorable combination of loads with maximum bending moment for a fixed support and maximum vertical force and maximum longitudinal-lateral displacement of the top part for a free-sliding support. The use of modern approaches to the operation modeling of the support constructions allows avoiding the excessive conservatism in estimating the stress-strain state of the supports and allows developing the construction optimal for metal intensity, while meeting the requirements for allowable stresses according to the actual normative documents...|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] commercial transportation of crude oil and petroleum products by pipeline is receiving increased attention in South Africa. Transnet Pipeline Transport has recently obtained permission from the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) to construct and operate a new petroleum products pipeline of 60 cm diameter from Durban to Gauteng. At an operating speed of 10 km/h the proposed 60 cm Transnet pipeline {{would be able to}} deliver 3, 54 million litres of petroleum product per hour. This is equivalent to 89 deliveries per hour using road tank vehicles with an average carrying capacity of 40 000 litres of fuel per vehicle. This pipeline throughput is also equivalent to two trains departing per hour, each consisting of 42 petroleum tank wagons with an average carrying capacity of 42 500 litres of fuel per wagon. Considering that such road trucks and rail wagons return empty to the upstream refineries in Durban, it is clear that there is no tenable long-term alternative to pipeline transport: • pipeline transport is substantially cheaper than road and rail transport; • pipeline transport is much safer than rail and especially road transport; and • pipeline transport frees up alternative road and rail transport capacity. Pipeline transport is a non-containerised bulk mode of transport for the carriage of suitable liquids (for example, petroleum commodities, which include crude oil, refined fuel products and liquid petro-chemicals), gas, slurrified coal and certain water-suspended ores and minerals. In South Africa, petroleum products account for the majority of commercial pipeline traffic, followed by crude oil and natural gas. There are three basic types of petroleum pipeline transport systems: 1. Gathering pipeline systems 2. Crude oil <b>trunk</b> <b>pipeline</b> systems 3. Refined products pipeline systems Collectively, these systems provide a continuous link between extraction, processing, distribution, and wholesalers’ depots in areas of consumption.

Because cost is incurred without adding value each time goods are handled (activity 4) at a terminal or storage facility, a primary logistics objective is to eliminate handling wherever possible. With the carriage of crude oil and petroleum products by pipeline this objective is fully met. Commodity intake, haulage, and discharge are combined in one process, usually a remotecontrolled operation. Pipeline transport is a non-containerised bulk mode of transport thereby obviating the need for packaging (activity 5) and returning empty containers. Pipelines provide a direct and long-term link between these origins and destinations. If necessary a continuous service can be provided with no need for a return trip or a reverse pumping process (activity 11). The elimination of handling, packaging and reverse logistics activities contribute substantially to the high measure of economies of scale that pipeline transport enjoys.
