5|$|In March 2005, Underoath {{participated in}} the inaugural Taste of Chaos tour, and shortly after, {{embarked}} on their first headlining tour. The band premiered two brand-new songs during {{the length of the}} tour. They played a part of the Warped Tour, but declined to perform for the entirety of the tour in order <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> record another album. Underoath made their first covers of national magazines appearing on CCM Magazine in July 2005 and then Alternative Press in September, and in October, They're Only Chasing Safety was re-released in a two-disc set with four formerly unreleased songs. Also included was re-mastered album artwork by Jacob Bannon of Converge, and a DVD with over two hours of footage of the band touring in support of the album. As of 2005, They're Only Chasing Safety has sold more than 218,000 copies, with the re-release selling an additional 279,000 copies, making a combined sales of more than 500,000 copies in the US alone.|$|E
25|$|On February 24, 1987, King {{suffered}} a major {{heart attack and}} had to undergo a quintuple-bypass surgery. It was a life-altering event as previously, smoking {{was one of his}} trademarks and he was unashamed of his addiction. King was a three-pack-a-day smoker and kept a lit cigarette during his interviews, so he would not have <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> light up during breaks. He now encourages curbing smoking {{to reduce the risk of}} cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|The bootblack contestants {{work during}} the Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of IML {{during the time that}} the Leather Market is open, a total of {{approximately}} 20 hours over three days. In previous years, the bootblacks were allowed to shine boots and collect tickets at all times during the weekend. Since 2001, the bootblack contestants have established a gentlemen's agreement {{at the start of the}} weekend that they will not shine boots or accept ballots except during the established competition hours. This agreement was conceived to give the contestants the freedom <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> enjoy the weekend without feeling the pressure to always be bootblacking.|$|E

25|$|In England's first innings, {{the local}} boy was cheered affectionately {{all the way}} to the middle by an avid Oval crowd. Fred Spofforth, however, soon walloped the hero three excruciating blows—one in the ribs, another on the knee and one more on the elbow. Read was {{compelled}} to hold up the game on two of these occasions <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> convalesce, and it was, by all reports, an exceptionally valiant knock. Read finished unbeaten on nineteen, the second best score of the innings, and the masses cheered him all the way back to the pavilion just as they had cheered him from it; indeed, they it patently apparent right through this game that he was an authentic darling of the people.|$|E
25|$|Qualifying {{took place}} in warm weather conditions. In {{the first group of}} five runners, where all drivers elected <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} tyre temperature, Rosenqvist paced the session, half a second faster than second-placed Engel and Sarrazin was third. Piquet was fourth-fastest, while Heidfeld was affected by a throttle sensor malfunction that prevented him from recording a maximum power lap. After completing his lap, Heidfeld stopped his car on the track to rectify the problem which caused him to start {{at the back of the}} grid. Buemi drove cleanly was the fastest driver in the second group; Abt was 0.013 seconds slower than Buemi in second and Prost third. Dillmann and Carroll (who missed the turn nine apex) were the slowest drivers of the second group. In the third group, López recorded the fastest time, ahead of Turvey and di Grassi. Evans took fourth and Félix da Costa rounded out the top five. Despite losing time in the second sector, Bird set the fastest overall time of any competitor in the group qualifying stages in the fourth group at one minute and 7.805 seconds. Vergne was second-fastest, ahead of the Dragon pairing of Duval and d'Ambrosio. Frijns was the slowest driver in the fourth group, and at the end of group qualifying, the times set by Bird, López, Vergne, Buemi and Rosenqvist were fast enough to enable progression into super pole. Rosenqvist clinched the second position of his career with a time of one minute and 8.208 seconds despite contending with an oversteering car. He was joined on the grid's front row by Buemi who recorded a lap 0.098 seconds slower than Rosenqvist. López struggled with wheelspin, and lost time with oversteer entering turn six, restricting him to third. Bird was close to Rosenqvist's pace in the first sector, but took fourth after drifting slightly through the seventh turn. Vergne struggled with his car's handling because of oversteer and persistent brake locking, causing him to start from fifth place.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Miracles" [...] {{focus on the}} {{extraordinary}} events humans experience in life which often go unacknowledged, and encourages listeners <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{look at the world}} and reevaluate their life. The song's music is built around an ascending synthesizer melody, and climaxes with an electric guitar solo performed by Mike E. Clark, and beatboxing by Joseph Utsler.

2500|$|Some reviewers {{were more}} {{critical}} of the game. The reviewer for Computer Gaming World said that [...] "There's nothing really wrong with Outlaws. There just isn't much right with it." [...] The reviewer noted that the game had excellent music and art, but felt that the game had nothing new or innovative to offer players. Edge magazine's reviewer stated that [...] "not for the first time, shown that it's not infallible." [...] Charlie Brooker of PC Zone (UK) had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> warm up to the game. [...] "when you start playing Outlaws, it feels downright cruddy." [...] Brooker stated that after a lengthy amount of play his opinion changed, and ultimately he gave the game a favorable review.|$|E

2500|$|The {{success of}} an amphibious landing at that location, in a basin {{consisting}} substantially of reclaimed marshland {{and surrounded by}} mountains, depended on {{the element of surprise}} and the swiftness with which the invaders could build up strength and move inland relative to the reaction time and strength of the defenders. Any delay could result in the occupation of the mountains by the defenders and the consequent entrapment of the invaders. Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, commander of the U.S. Fifth Army, understood that risk, but Clark did not pass on his appreciation of the situation to his subordinate, [...] Lucas, who preferred <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> entrench against an expected counterattack. The initial landing achieved complete surprise with no opposition and a jeep patrol even made it as far as the outskirts of Rome. However, Lucas, who had little confidence in the operation as planned, failed to capitalize on the element of surprise and delaying his advance until he judged his position was sufficiently consolidated and he had sufficient strength.|$|E
2500|$|Inspiration for the song's lyrics came via the Internet {{generation}} and group members Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope raising children. In response to both modern jadedness {{and their children}} experiencing wonders {{of the world for}} the first time, the group wanted to write a song about natural phenomena humans experience in life which often go unacknowledged. The closing lyrics encourage listeners <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> look at the world and [...] "appreciate the things that life has to offer". According to Violent J, [...] "What's a shame is how people walk around blind to it all. They lost their spirit about everything. If you can’t even see the miracle in animals, then you must have never truly loved a pet." [...] He believes that scientific explanations can sometimes kill the intriguing mysteries of the world, such as how ancient pyramids were made. Violent J admits that the song's lyrics discuss [...] "things [...] may not be actual miracles. They may have scientific facts explaining them [...] But nonetheless, these things are still incredible [...] and they should be appreciated." [...] He added that the group's use of the word 'miracle' was intended to mean [...] "something fuckin’ amazing and incredible, [...] special, awesome event, [...] a great, wonderful thing." ...|$|E
