40|$|The test {{generation}} method SaMsTaG (SDL and MSC based {{test case}} generation) has successfully {{been applied to}} the B-ISDN ATM Adaption Layer protocol SSCOP (Service Specific Connection Oriented Protocol). In parallel to our work the ATM Forum developed another test suite for SSCOP. Unlike the test suite generated automatically by the SaMsTaG tool, this one was specified manually. Both test suites have been compared, but the results were only of restricted value because the test suites base on different test architectures. In order to achieve more significant comparison results the SaMsTaG tool has been adapted to the <b>test</b> <b>method</b> <b>chosen</b> by the ATM Forum, i. e., the remote test method, and the test suite has been re-generated.

40|$|In March 2002, the Swedish Work Environment Authority {{performed}} an inspection at Skottsundsbackens home for elderly in the municipality of Sundsvall. The Swedish Work Environment Authority {{came to the}} conclusion that the ergonomic problems many employees had experienced were related to the floor covering in the building. The municipality lodged an appeal, but in October 2005 the appeal was rejected by the Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden. In the decision you can read that “The Swedish Work Environment Authority points out that if the floor covering has got a suitable springiness or not can not be objectively judged, since there are no <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> for this”. In spite of this, the Swedish Work Environment Authority believes that the best way to minimise the risks of strain injuries is to replace the current floor covering with a softer floor covering. Since there are existing <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> to quantify properties of springiness (i. e. shock absorption and vertical deformation) for sport surfaces, the aim of this study has been to find out whether these methods can be applied to ordinary floor coverings. If it’s possible, this might be a way of objectively judge if a floor covering is suitable or not for a certain work activity. The <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> <b>chosen</b> were EN 14808 Surfaces for sports areas – Determination of shock absorption and EN 14809 Surfaces for sport areas – Determination of vertical deformation. The study could also bee seen as an inventory of what values that could be expected for ordinary floor coverings in Sweden. Another goal for the study was to find out whether or not it was possible to quantify the difference between the floor covering that was replaced at Skottsundsbacken and the softer one that was finally installed. The conclusions of the study were that the mentioned <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> are suitable for measuring mechanical comfort properties of floor coverings, exceptions made for homogeneous and heterogeneous floor coverings without any kind of foam backing. These floorings has got very little ability to absorb energy and the results from the measurements can not be used to discriminate between them.

The algorithm seeks {{to find a}} transformation that best maps instances from the feature space to a space where they concentrate towards {{the center of their}} own classes, while maximimizing the distance between class centers. We formulate the classifier as a quadratic program with quadratic constraints. We then simplify this formulation to a linear program that can be solved effectively using a linear programming solver (e. g., simplex-dual). We extend the formulation for LCC to enable the use of kernel functions for non-linear classification applications. We compare our method with two standard classification methods (support vector machine and linear discriminant analysis) and four state-of-the-art classification methods when they are applied to eight standard classification datasets. Our experimental results show that LCC is able to classify instances more accurately (based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic) in comparison to other <b>tested</b> <b>methods</b> on the <b>chosen</b> datasets.

The <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> represents a basis to start from, for designers and test engineers which make the testing more repetitive as well as time eventually can be saved. Before the <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> can be applied they must be verified as they are based on theoretical and empirical assumptions.

The structure makes an important component for documentation and the overview perspective. The structure is also flexible enough to be used for other test facilities, not only CD 7, which should be a natural continuation.
