40|$|OBJECTIVE:: <b>Transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> {{injury is}} the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality. A {{prospective}} study using electronic surveillance was conducted at two academic medical centers in the United States with the objective to define the clinical course and outcomes in <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury cases. DESIGN:: Prospective case study with controls. SETTING:: University of California, San Francisco and Mayo Clinic, Rochester. PATIENTS:: We prospectively enrolled 89 patients with <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury, 164 transfused controls, and 145 patients with possible <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury. INTERVENTIONS:: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: Patients with <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury had fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, and prolonged hypoxemia compared with controls. Of the patients with <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury, 29 of 37 patients (78 %) required initiation of mechanical ventilation and 13 of 53 (25 %) required initiation of vasopressors. Patients with <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury and possible <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury had an increased duration of mechanical ventilation and increased days in the ICU and hospital compared with controls. There were 15 of 89 patients with <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury (17 %) who died, whereas 61 of 145 patients with possible <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury (42 %) died and 7 of 164 of controls (4 %) died. Patients with <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury had evidence of more systemic inflammation with increases in circulating neutrophils and a decrease in platelets compared with controls. Patients with <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury and possible <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury also had a statistically significant increase in plasma interleukin- 8, interleukin- 10, and interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist posttransfusion compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS:: In conclusion, <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury produced a condition resembling the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and was associated with substantial in-hospital morbidity and mortality in patients with <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury compared with transfused controls. Patients with possible <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury had even higher in-hospital morbidity and mortality, suggesting that clinical outcomes in this group are mainly influenced by the underlying <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury risk factor(s). © 2014 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine...|$|R
40|$|Objective: <b>Transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> {{injury is}} the leading cause of transfusion-related {{morbidity}} and mortality. Clinical data on the pathogenesis of <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury are sparse. The objective of the present study was to determine inflammation and coagulation pathways involved in the onset of <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury. Design: Nested case-control study. Setting: Operating theatre and intensive care department of a tertiary referral hospital. Patients: Elective cardiac surgery patients requiring postsurgery intensive care admission. Interventions: None. Measurements: Cardiac surgery patients (n = 668) were prospectively screened for the onset of <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury. <b>Transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury cases (n = 16) were randomly assigned to transfused and nontransfused cardiac surgery controls in a 1 : 2 ratio. Blood samples were taken pre- and postoperatively and at onset of <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury. In addition, at onset of <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was obtained. In plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, levels of interleukin- 6, interleukin- 8, elastase-alpha(1) -antitrypsin complexes, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, plasminogen activator activity, and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 were determined by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Main Results: In all patients, cardiac surgery was associated with systemic inflammation, evidenced by an increase in plasma levels of interleukin- 6, interleukin- 8, and elastase-alpha(1) -antitrypsin complexes compared with presurgery levels (p <. 001). Prior to onset of <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury, systemic interleukin- 8 and interleukin- 6 levels were higher compared with nontransfused controls (p <. 01). In <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury cases, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of interleukin- 8, interleukin- 6, and elastase-alpha(1) -antitrypsin complexes were elevated compared with control groups (p <. 05). Both plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of thrombin-antithrombin complexes were enhanced in <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury cases compared with control groups (p <. 01). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of plasminogen activator activity were decreased due to an increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 levels in <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury cases compared with control groups (p <. 01), indicating suppressed fibrinolysis. Conclusions: Prior to onset of <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury, there is systemic inflammation and neutrophil sequestration. <b>Transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury is characterized by both systemic and pulmonary inflammation and activation of neutrophils, as well as enhanced coagulation and suppressed fibrinolysis.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the incidence, risk factors, and outcome of <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury in {{a cohort of}} critically ill patients. Design: In a retrospective cohort study, patients with <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury were identified using the consensus criteria of <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury within 6 hrs after transfusion. Inclusion criterion was a length of intensive care unit admission > 48 hrs. Patients developing <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury were matched (on age, sex, and admission diagnosis) to transfused control subjects and patients developing <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury from another origin. Setting: Tertiary referral hospital. Patients: All first-admitted patients from November 1, 2004, until October 1, 2007, to the intensive care unit. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Of 5208 admitted patients, 2024 patients had a length of stay > 48 hrs, of whom 109 were suspected <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury cases. Compared with transfused control subjects, risk factors for <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury were emergency cardiac surgery (odds ratio, 17. 6 [1. 8 - 168. 5]), hematologic malignancy (odds ratio, 13. 1 [2. 7 - 63. 8]), massive transfusion (odds ratio, 4. 5 [2. 1 - 9. 8]), sepsis (odds ratio, 2. 5 [1. 2 - 5. 2]), mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 3. 0 [1. 3 - 7. 1], and high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (odds ratio, 1. 1 [1. 0 - 1. 1]; p <. 03 for all). The volume of platelets and plasma transfused was associated with <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury in the univariate analysis. However, this association disappeared in the multivariate analysis. Compared with <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury control subjects, risk factors for <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury were sepsis (odds ratio, 2. 4 [1. 1 - 5. 3]) and high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (odds ratio, 1. 1 [1. 0 - 1. 1]), whereas pneumonia (odds ratio, 0. 4 [0. 2 - 0. 7]) was a negative predictive factor. Patients with <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury had a longer duration of mechanical ventilation compared with transfused control subjects and <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury control subjects (231 [138 - 472] vs. 71 [46 - 163] and 70 [42 - 121] hrs, p <. 001). Also, 90 -day survival of patients with <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury was lower compared with transfused control subjects and <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury control subjects (53 % vs. 75 % and 83 %, p <. 02). Conclusions: <b>Transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury is common in critically ill patients. <b>Transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury may contribute to an adverse outcome associated with transfusion. This study identifies <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury risk factors, which may aid in assessing {{the risks and benefits}} of transfusion in critically ill patients.

We performed a post-hoc analysis of a nested case-control study that had been undertaken in a tertiary referral hospital. <b>Transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury cases were matched with controls (transfused patients not developing lung injury). Of these 218 patients, 66 used aspirin (30 %).

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> {{injury is}} {{emerging}} as a common cause of transfusion-related adverse events. However, awareness about this entity in the medical fraternity is low and it, consequently, remains a very under-reported and often an under-diagnosed complication of transfusion therapy. Case presentation We report {{a case of a}} 46 -year old woman who developed acute respiratory and hemodynamic instability following a single unit blood transfusion in the postoperative period. Investigation results were non-specific and a diagnosis of <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury was made after excluding other possible causes of <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury. She responded to symptomatic management with ventilatory and vasopressor support and recovered completely over the next 72 hours. Conclusion The diagnosis of <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury relies on excluding other causes of acute pulmonary edema following transfusion, such as sepsis, volume overload, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. All plasma containing blood products have been implicated in <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury, with the majority being linked to whole blood, packed red blood cells, platelets, and fresh-frozen plasma. The pathogenesis of <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury may be explained by a "two-hit" hypothesis, involving priming of the inflammatory machinery and then activation of this primed mechanism. Treatment is supportive, with prognosis being substantially better than for most other causes of <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> {{injury is}} defined as acute {{respiratory}} failure which develops during or within 6 hours after transfusion of a blood component in a patient with no risk factors for respiratory insufficiency. <b>Transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury is diagnosed based on clinical manifestation and by excluding other causes of <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury. Unambiguous diagnosis is difficult. Looking for anti-HLA and/or anti-HNA antibodies in donors and sometimes in recipients {{plays an important role}} in lab tests. Negative antibody findings, either in a donor or in a recipient, do not exclude <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury, which, however, does not exempt from performing leukocyte antibody tests since they are extremely important for <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury prophylaxis. The ways to prevent this reaction include: disqualifying donors with anti-HLA/HNA antibodies, screening for antibodies in multiparous women and in individuals after transfusion, modifying the way blood components are prepared and limiting blood transfusion in clinical practice. The paper presents a case of a  38 -year-old woman with acute myeloid leukaemia, hospitalised at the Department of Internal Diseases and Haematology of the Military Institute of Medicine for subsequent courses of chemotherapy. During treatment, the patient had red cells and platelets concentrates transfused several times with no transfusion-related reactions. Eight days after the last chemotherapy infusion, the patient developed high temperature and her platelet count was 14 × 103 /mL. Therefore, the patient received a platelet concentrate again. About 1 hour after transfusion, the patient complained about chest pain and dyspnoea. She needed oxygen therapy. Chest X-ray revealed lung oedema with no signs of left ventricular failure.

40|$|Objectives: To assess 1) the {{effectiveness}} of male-predominant plasma transfusion strategy for preventing <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury and related mortality; and 2) whether this effect varies across different patient subgroups. Design: Systematic Review and meta-analysis: Data were identified by querying MEDLINE and EMBASE (including proceedings of major conferences on blood transfusions), searching the Internet for hemovigilance reports, reviewing reference lists of eligible articles and contacting experts in the field. Eligible were all studies reporting <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury incidence, allcause mortality (primary outcomes), hospital length of stay, time to extubation, Pa o 2 /F io 2 -ratio or blood pressure changes (secondary outcomes) in recipients of plasma transfusions containing relatively more plasma from individuals at low risk of carrying leukocyte-antibodies ("male plasma") than those receiving comparator plasma ("control plasma"). No limits were placed on study design, population or language. The only exclusion criteria were non-human subjects and lack of control group. Prespecified study quality indicators (including risk of bias assessment) and potential effect modifiers were tested using Cochran's Q Test. Final analyses using random-effects models and I 2 to assess heterogeneity were performed in the subset of studies judged {{to provide the best}} evidence and separately for significantly different subgroups using STATA 12. 1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Setting: As per primary studies. Patients/Subjects: As per primary studies. Interventions: As per primary studies (generally: exposure to plasma containing relatively more male plasma than comparator plasma). Measurements and Main Results: From a total of 850 retrieved records, we identified 45 eligible studies. For <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury incidence, final analysis was restricted to 13 cohort studies and one randomized controlled trial in which <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury cases only involved plasma transfusions. Risk of <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury and mortality in plasma recipients exposed to men when compared with control plasma were 0. 27 (95 % CI, 0. 20 - 0. 38; p 2 = 0 %; n = 14; 286 events) and 0. 89 (95 % CI, 0. 80 - 1. 00; p = 0. 04; I 2 = 79 %; n = 7; 5, 710 events), respectively. No other significant interactions were found. Secondary outcomes showed similar results but were less reported and the studies were more heterogeneous. Sensitivity analyses did not alter the results. There was no evidence of publication bias. Discussion: More than 800 million people in 17 countries are subject to male-predominant plasma transfusion policy and at least three more countries are planning or considering adoption of this strategy. On the basis of most observational data, judged to be of high quality, male-predominant plasma transfusion strategy reduces plasma-related <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury incidence and possibly mortality.

The first event may include surgery, trauma, or infection; the second involves the transfu-sion of antileukocyte antibodies or bioac-tive lipids within the blood product. To-gether, these events induce neutrophil activation in the lungs, causing endothe-lial damage and capillary leakage. Neutro...|$|R
50|$|<b>Transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury (TRALI) is an {{uncommon}} syndrome that {{is due to}} the presence of leukocyte antibodies in transfused plasma. TRALI is believed to occur in approximately one in every 5000 transfusions. Leukoagglutination and pooling of granulocytes in the recipient's lungs may occur, with release of the contents of leukocyte granules, and resulting injury to cellular membranes, endothelial surfaces, and potentially to lung parenchyma. In most cases leukoagglutination results in mild dyspnea and pulmonary infiltrates within about 6 hours of transfusion, and spontaneously resolves.|$|R

Antibodies {{against these}} antigens cause alloimmune neutropenia in neonates and autoimmune neutropenia in children. After transfusion, anti-neutrophil antibodies can cause febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions or <b>transfusion-related</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lung</b> injury (TRALI). 1 Methods for detecting neutrophil antibodies include granulocyte agglutination, granulocyte immunofluorescence test (GIFT) or GIFT using flow cytometry (flow-GIFT), and monoclonal antibody immobilization of neutrophil antigens (MAINA) testing.
