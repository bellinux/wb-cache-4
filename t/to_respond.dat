5|$|One of {{the primary}} roles of the {{regiment}} {{is to provide a}} counter-terrorist capability, with an element of the SASR designated as the Tactical Assault Group (West) <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to domestic incidents on the west coast of Australia and also for international operations. TAG (West) maintains a short-notice capability to conduct military operations beyond the scope of state/territory and federal Police Tactical Groups. Offensive counter-terrorist operations may include direct action and hostage recovery. A capability to board ships at anchor, ships underway and off-shore gas and oil platforms is also maintained. TAG (West) is kept at high readiness for a period of 12 months, before being replaced by another squadron in this role. The 2nd Commando Regiment provides Tactical Assault Group (East) <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to domestic incidents on the east coast of Australia.|$|E

5|$|Since Deep Blue's {{victory over}} Garry Kasparov in chess in 1997, IBM {{had been on}} the hunt for a new challenge. In 2004, IBM Research manager Charles Lickel, over dinner with coworkers, noticed that the {{restaurant}} they were in had fallen silent. He soon discovered the cause of this evening hiatus: Ken Jennings, who was then {{in the middle of his}} successful 74-game run on Jeopardy!. Nearly the entire restaurant had piled toward the televisions, mid-meal, to watch the phenomenon. Intrigued by the quiz show as a possible challenge for IBM, Lickel passed the idea on, and in 2005, IBM Research executive Paul Horn backed Lickel up, pushing for someone in his department to take up the challenge of playing Jeopardy! with an IBM system. Though he initially had trouble finding any research staff willing to take on what looked to be a much more complex challenge than the wordless game of chess, eventually David Ferrucci took him up on the offer. In competitions managed by the United States government, Watson's predecessor, a system named Piquant, was usually able <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> correctly to only about 35% of clues and often required several minutes <b>to</b> <b>respond.</b> To compete successfully on Jeopardy!, Watson would need <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> in no more than a few seconds, and at that time, the problems posed by the game show were deemed to be impossible to solve.|$|E
5|$|Some {{historians have}} argued that the Ford {{administration}} felt the need <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a Soviet plot. But work by Andrew Gawthorpe, published in 2009, based on an analysis of the administration's internal discussions, shows that Ford's national security team understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local, and perhaps even accidental, provocation by an immature Khmer government. Nevertheless, they felt the need <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> forcefully to discourage further provocations by other Communist countries in Asia.|$|E

5|$|The ideal age {{to start}} {{training}} dromedaries for riding is three years, {{although they may}} be stubborn and unruly. At first the camel's head is controlled, and it is later trained <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to sitting and standing commands, and to allow mounting. At this stage a camel will often try to escape when a trainer tries to mount it. The next stage involves training it <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to reins. The animal must be given loads gradually and not forced to carry heavy loads {{before the age of}} six. Riding camels should not be struck on their necks, rather they should be struck behind the right leg of the rider. Leese described two types of saddles generally used in camel riding; the Arabian markloofa used by single riders and the Indian pakra used when two riders mount the same camel.|$|E

5|$|The {{regiment}} {{formed a}} key element of the security force in place for the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000, and in the lead-up to the event the regiment underwent a period of modernisation, acquiring new equipment and capabilities, including the ability <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to chemical, biological and radiological threats, as well as developing techniques for the clandestine boarding of moving ships at night. During the Games two SASR squadrons were available for counter-terrorist operations, with one designated <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to incidents in Sydney and Canberra, while the other was on standby for incidents elsewhere. Defence involvement in domestic security increased after the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, and the unit has since formed part of the security force for a range of international sporting and political events held in Australia, including the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting at Coolum, Queensland in March 2002, and the visit of US President George W. Bush to Canberra in October 2003. The SASR maintains TAG (West) <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to incidents on the west coast of Australia. It also provided the training and use of their facilities to raise a second Tactical Assault Group in the 2nd Commando Regiment.|$|E
