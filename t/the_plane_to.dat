5|$|At 22:18 AT (01:18 UTC), ATC Moncton {{handed over}} traffic control of <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> Halifax Terminal Control Unit, a {{specialized}} ATC unit managing traffic {{in and out}} of Halifax.|$|E
5|$|The HEADING mode of the {{autopilot}} {{would normally be}} engaged sometime after takeoff to comply with vectors from ATC, and then after receiving appropriate ATC clearance, to guide <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> intercept the desired INS course line.|$|E
5|$|There {{are only}} seven {{absolute}} world records for fixed-wing aircraft {{recognized by the}} Fédération Aéronautique Internationale and Fossett broke three {{of them in the}} Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer. All three records were previously held by Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager from their flight in the Voyager in 1986. Fossett contributed the GlobalFlyer to the Smithsonian Institution's permanent collection. It is on display at the Udvar-Hazy Center of the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. Fossett flew <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> the Center and taxied <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> the front door.|$|E

5|$|Cooper {{served as}} a DH-4 bomber pilot with the United States Army Air Service during World War I. On September 26, 1918, his plane was shot down. The plane caught fire, and Cooper spun <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> suck the flames out. Cooper survived, {{although}} he suffered burns, injured his hands, and was presumed dead. German soldiers saw his plane's incredible landing {{and took him to}} a prisoner reserve hospital.|$|E
5|$|On September 3, a C-130 Hercules {{air force}} flight left Caracas, Venezuela for Spain, with a flight crew of 8 and 60 {{members of the}} Central University of Venezuela choir. That night, heavy {{rainfall}} from the hurricane forced <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> land on the Azores island of Terceira Island, Portugal. After attempting twice to land in hurricane-force winds, the plane crashed in a hill one mile from the runway of Lajes Field, killing all 68 aboard.|$|E
5|$|Oscorp {{scientist}} Richard Parker records a {{video message}} {{to explain his}} disappearance. Later, he and his wife, Mary, are aboard a private jet hijacked by an assassin sent to kill Richard and his wife. Richard and Mary fight off the man, but the ensuing struggle causes <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> crash, killing both Richard and Mary, after he uploads the video.|$|E
50|$|The right lower {{quadrant}} (RLQ) {{extends from}} <b>the</b> median <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{right of the}} patient, and from <b>the</b> umbilical <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right inguinal ligament. The equivalent term for animals is right posterior quadrant.|$|R
50|$|Let us {{consider}} an axis Δ, and <b>planes</b> belonging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> zone of this axis, i.e. Δ {{is in all}} these <b>planes,</b> <b>the</b> intersection of all <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> is Δ. If we call P <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> that is perpendicular to Δ, then <b>the</b> normals <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> all belong <b>to</b> P. Thus, the poles of <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> belonging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same zone are on the trace of <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> P perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> axis.|$|R

5|$|According to saxophonist Jimmy Heath, Timmons joined Clark Terry's {{big band}} {{for a tour}} of Europe in 1974. He was unwell and drank on <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> Sweden, and fell while {{drinking}} at the bar before the band's first concert, in Malmö. Susceptible to blood clotting, he was flown back to the US. On March 1, 1974, he died from cirrhosis, {{at the age of}} 38, at St Vincent's Hospital in New York. He had been in hospital for a month. He was buried in Philadelphia, and was survived by his wife, Estelle, and son, also Bobby.|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} be {{extended}} from <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> the sphere and other quadratic surfaces. For the sphere, the problem is to construct all the circles (the boundaries of spherical caps) that are tangent to three given circles on the sphere. This spherical {{problem can be}} rendered into a corresponding planar problem using stereographic projection. Once the solutions to the planar problem have been constructed, the corresponding solutions to the spherical problem can be determined by inverting the stereographic projection. Even more generally, one can consider the problem of four tangent curves that result from the intersections of an arbitrary quadratic surface and four planes, a problem first considered by Charles Dupin.|$|E
5|$|Demeke {{demanded that}} the {{aircraft}} be flown to New York City and demanded political asylum in the United States. After being told that the plane {{would need to be}} refueled, Demeke agreed to allow a refueling stop in Hannover, Germany. The aircraft landed at Hannover-Langenhagen Airport around noon local time, where it was surrounded by law enforcement officials. Demeke remained in the cockpit with the pistol to the pilot's head, and threatened to begin killing a flight attendant every five minutes. German authorities allowed <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> depart after Demeke threatened to kill his hostages but promised to surrender peacefully upon reaching the United States.|$|E

5|$|High {{school student}} Alex Browning boards Volée Airlines Flight 180 with his classmates for their senior trip to Paris, France. Before take-off, Alex has a premonition {{that the plane}} will suffer a catastrophic engine failure, causing <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> explode mid-air and kill {{everyone}} on board. When the events from his vision begin to repeat themselves in reality, he panics and a fight breaks out between Alex and his rival, Carter Horton. This leads to several passengers being removed from the plane, including Alex; Carter; Alex's best friend, Tod Waggner; Carter's girlfriend, Terry Chaney; teacher Valerie Lewton; and students Billy Hitchcock and Clear Rivers. None of the passengers, except for Clear, believe Alex about his vision until the plane explodes on take-off, killing the remaining passengers on board. Afterwards, the survivors are interrogated by two FBI agents, who believe that Alex {{had something to do}} with the explosion.|$|E
5|$|On September 18, the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued heavy {{rainfall}} and wind warnings for portions of southern Ontario. A gale warning was also issued for Lake Ontario, eastern Lake Erie, the Saint Lawrence River and Georgian Bay. A news report on September 14 warned conditions could {{be similar to}} the disaster caused by Hurricane Hazel 49years prior, resulting in widespread media coverage on the hurricane. Researchers on a Convair 580 flight studied the structure of Isabel transitioning into an extratropical storm, after two similar studies for Hurricane Michael in 2000 and Tropical Storm Karen in 2001. While flying in a thunderstorm, ice build forced <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> descend.|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{suggests}} that Hank and Jacob return a paltry {{sum of the}} money to <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> avoid suspicion from local authorities. While travelling on foot to the woods, the brothers come across an old man on a snowmobile. Jacob, thinking that their cover is blown, bludgeons him. When the man regains consciousness, Hank suffocates him, then uses the snowmobile to drive his body off a bridge, making the murder look like an accidental death. The following night, Lou drunkenly demands some of the money from Hank, because he has spent recklessly since the discovery. When Hank refuses, Lou threatens to go to the authorities, having learned from Jacob about the old man's murder.|$|E

5|$|Soon after Flight 825 took off, a {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas scored a hit on its {{starboard}} wing with a Soviet-made Strela-2 surface-to-air infrared homing missile, critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing. An attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of Karoi was foiled by a ditch, which caused <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> cartwheel and break up. Of the 52 passengers and four crew, 38 died in the crash; the insurgents then approached the wreckage, rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire. Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush, while a further five lived because {{they had gone to}} look for water before the guerrillas arrived.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptian army {{unleashed}} {{its full}} anti-aircraft arsenal and hit Alon's plane, {{but he managed}} to crash-land unharmed at 20:05, performing a ground loop. Weizmann landed at 20:15. Eddie Cohen, a volunteer pilot from South Africa, crashed and died, although it is unknown whether he was hit by anti-aircraft fire, or a technical problem caused <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> malfunction. A report by Dan Tolkovsky, the Israeli Air Force operations officer at the time, stated that Cohen likely attempted to land at the Hatzor Airbase instead of Ekron, where eyewitnesses saw a burning plane crashing in the distance. He was the first Israeli Air Force KIA, and was buried in Tel Aviv (Nahalat Yitzhak) after his remains were found at the end of 1949.|$|E
5|$|The {{autopilot}} {{system used}} at the time had four basic control modes: HEADING, VOR/LOC, ILS, and INS. The HEADING mode maintained a constant magnetic course selected by the pilot. The VOR/LOC mode maintained the plane on a specific course, transmitted from a VOR (VHF omnidirectional range, a type of short-range radio signal transmitted from ground beacons) or Localizer (LOC) beacon selected by the pilot. The ILS (instrument landing system) mode caused <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> track both vertical and lateral course beacons, {{which led to a}} specific runway selected by the pilot. The INS (inertial navigation system) mode maintained the plane on lateral course lines between selected flight plan waypoints programmed into the INS computer.|$|E
50|$|Then <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> {{gets down}} <b>to</b> 15 km {{at a high}} angle of attack, being {{progressively}} decelerated by the atmosphere; at this altitude, after transition to aeronautical mode, the jets are reignited <b>to</b> bring <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> back <b>to</b> a classical landing strip.|$|R
50|$|Charlie D'Antoine—an Aboriginal {{flying boat}} refueller—helped two {{passengers}} from <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> <b>to</b> reach <b>the</b> shore, swimming through burning fuel and wreckage. D'Antoine later received a bravery {{award from the}} Dutch government and was invited to attend a royal reception in the Netherlands.|$|R
50|$|Typically the margueriete {{consisted}} of fifteen to eighteen hardstands {{around a large}} central hangar. Each hardstand held one or two aircraft, and allowed <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> <b>to</b> be spaced approximately 150 feet (50 meters) apart. Each squadron was assigned to a separate hangar/hardstand complex.|$|R
5|$|The plane's {{landing gear}} {{mired in the}} water and mud, causing <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> flip upside down and skid to a stop. Although the {{aircraft}} survived the landing nearly intact, Petty Officer Koga died instantly on impact, probably from a broken neck or a blunt-force blow to his head. Koga's wingmen, circling above, had orders to destroy any Zeros that crash-landed in enemy territory, but as they did not know if Koga was still alive, they could not bring themselves to strafe his plane. They decided to leave without firing on it. The Japanese submarine stationed off Akutan Island to pick up pilots searched for Koga in vain before being driven off by the destroyer USS Williamson.|$|E
5|$|At the Rio de Janeiro location, {{many months}} later, Roger Moore arrived {{several days later}} than {{scheduled}} for shooting due to recurrent health problems and an attack of kidney stones that he had suffered while in France. After arriving in Rio de Janeiro, Moore was immediately whisked off the plane and went straight to hair and make-up work, before re-boarding <b>the</b> <b>plane,</b> <b>to</b> film the sequence with him arriving as James Bond in the film. Sugarloaf Mountain was a prominent location in the film, and during filming of the cable car sequence in which Bond and Goodhead are attacked by Jaws during mid-air transportation high above Rio de Janeiro, the stuntman Richard Graydon slipped and narrowly avoided falling to his death. For the scene in which Jaws bites into the steel tramway cable with his teeth, the cable was actually made of liquorice, although Richard Kiel was still required to use his steel dentures.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{contacts}} Flynn, {{telling him}} that anti-venom {{will be ready for}} the passengers when they land. However, Flynn discovers that the cockpit is filled with snakes and Rick is dead. After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on prior flight experience. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> depressurize. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Flynn and Troy take the controls of the plane and Troy reveals that his flight experience was from a video game flight simulator. Despite his lack of real-world experience, after Troy makes an emergency landing, the plane makes it to the terminal. The passengers leave the plane and anti-venom is given to those who need it. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the plane, a final snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to his wearing a ballistic vest. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to Bali and teaches him how to surf.|$|E
