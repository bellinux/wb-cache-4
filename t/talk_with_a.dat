5|$|Before the {{detailed}} wind tunnel tests Wilbur traveled to Chicago at Chanute's invitation {{to give a}} lecture to the Western Society of Engineers on September 18, 1901. He presented a thorough report about the 1900–01 glider experiments and complemented his <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lantern slide show of photographs. Wilbur's speech was the first public account of the brothers' experiments. A report {{was published in the}} Journal of the society, which was then separately published as an offprint titled Some Aeronautical Experiments in a 300 copy edition.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the tournament, Coach Lumbly {{tells the}} debate team that Ginny has {{transferred}} to Townsend Prep for the remainder of her senior year and that Hal will be paired with Heston for the day. Struggling with his speech and his stutter, Hal calls his therapist, who suggests that he sing his speech or <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> foreign accent. Hal and Heston finish the day without much success, while Ginny wins a trophy for First Place as an Individual Speaker, which inexplicably goes missing. Coach Lumbly asks Hal to leave the team, telling him that Ginny had never planned to debate as his partner and had only recruited him as a cruel joke to damage the school's chances of winning. He breaks into Earl's bedroom and takes a bottle of stolen tequila, then rides with Heston to his friend Lewis's house, who lives across the street from Ginny. A drunken Hal drags Lewis's mother's cello across the street and throws it through Ginny's window just as she is arriving home with her new teammate, Ram.|$|E

However, 6 Towns' license application, and other local stations were turned down. No station in Stoke-on-Trent was awarded a licence due to frequency allocations.

25|$|Following {{consultations}} {{with a number}} of ministers of State, King Albert received Herman Van Rompuy (CD), the outgoing President of the Chamber of Representatives, and charged him with an exploratory mission in order to find a solution to the political crisis. Van Rompuy was considered by Flemish and French-speaking parties and newspapers as a good choice. He met on August 30 with the presidents of several parties of the orange-blue coalition, in particular Jo Vandeurzen (CD), Bart De Wever (N-VA), Bart Somers (Open VLD) and Jöelle Milquet (CDH). On August 31, he met with presidents Didier Reynders (MR), Olivier Maingain, (FDF) and Jean-Michel Javaux (Ecolo). The content of the discussions is unknown as Van Rompuy wanted to communicate and negotiate discreetly. De Standaard noted that Van Rompuy did not <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> member of the PS, which could mean he wanted to reach the required two-thirds majority for constitutional reform with the ecologists (Ecolo on the French-speaking side) and rather that the PS.|$|E
25|$|By December 18, Gacy was {{beginning}} to show visible signs of strain {{as a result of}} the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 civil suit against the Des Plaines police, demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to a Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the parka pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> contractor. This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11: the presence of the receipt indicated that Gacy must have been in contact with Robert Piest after the youth had left the Nisson Pharmacy on December 11.|$|E
25|$|The person {{detained}} as {{an alleged}} militant {{turned out to}} be Akhmed Chataev (Chatayev), a one-handed ethnic Chechen refugee and Russian citizen who has received refugee status in Austria and who had lived in Pankisi for more than two years. On September 6, Information Center of Kakheti announced that Chatayev, described as Umarov’s personal representative in Europe (according to other sources, Chatayev was rather a former special envoy of the late Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov), who had briefly disappeared after the special operation in Lopota Gorge. Chatayev insisted that he had been brought by two Georgian Interior Ministry's counter-terrorist department officials, Sandro Amiridze and Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, as a negotiator to <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> group of 17 Chechen and Kist militants that intended to travel to Chechnya via Dagestan. According to Chatayev, he was unarmed and was wounded when an unknown shooter suddenly shot him in his left leg as he was waiting for a reply from the authorities after relaying by phone the group's refusal to disarm. After that, he hid and barely survived for 10 days without any food nor water before surrendering to the Border Police, but his wound got seriously infected and a part of his foot was later amputated in the Gori Military Hospital, where he spent the next 10 days.|$|E

500|$|The role of Brody {{was offered}} to Robert Duvall, but the actor was {{interested}} only in portraying Quint. Charlton Heston expressed a desire for the role, but Spielberg felt that Heston would bring a screen persona too grand for {{the part of a}} police chief of a modest community. Roy Scheider became interested in the project after overhearing Spielberg at a party <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> screenwriter about having the shark jump up onto a boat. Spielberg was initially apprehensive about hiring Scheider, fearing he would portray a [...] "tough guy", similar to his role in The French Connection.|$|E
500|$|Five {{days after}} {{arriving}} at Sobibor, Pechersky was again approached by Solomon Leitman {{on behalf of}} Leon Feldhendler, {{the leader of the}} camp's Polish Jews. Leitman {{was one of the few}} prisoners who understood Russian and Pechersky didn't speak either Yiddish or Polish. Pechersky was invited to <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> group of Jewish prisoner leaders from Poland, to whom he spoke about the Red Army victory in the Battle of Stalingrad and partisan victories. When one of the prisoners asked him why the partisans won't rescue them from Sobibor, Pechersky reportedly replied: [...] "What for? To free us all? The partisans have their hands full already. Nobody will do our job for us." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} after Feng Jianmei's story went public, the family {{suffered}} from what Zhang called [...] "state-backed harassment." [...] The harassment started when Deng Jiyuan attempted to go to Beijing to <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lawyer and do a television interview. Jiyuan's travel attempt was stopped by [...] "more than 100 people and a dozen cars," [...] according to Deng Jicai. [...] Then, [...] "a man suddenly appeared and kicked my brother in the stomach." [...] After Jiyuan was interviewed by Stern magazine on June 22, the harassment from the government became worse, with Jiyuan stating that he was subsequently followed by [...] "local officials and thugs" [...] everywhere he went, even the bathroom. He then disappeared from public sight on June 24, only phoning home on June 26 {{to say he was}} safe, but his whereabouts remained unknown.|$|E

500|$|Richard Schickel of Time {{magazine}} praised Zorro as {{a summer}} blockbuster which paid tribute to the classical Hollywood swashbuckler films. [...] "The action in this movie, most of which {{takes the form of}} spectacular stunt work performed by real, as opposed to digitized, people," [...] Schickel stated, [...] "is motivated by simple, powerful emotions of an old-fashioned and rather melodramatic nature." [...] Zorro exceeded Roger Ebert's expectations, who was surprised by the screenplay's display of traditional film craftsmanship. [...] "It's a reminder of the time when stunts and special effects were integrated into stories, {{rather than the other way}} around." [...] Ebert later called The Mask of Zorro [...] "probably the best Zorro movie ever made." [...] Despite giving credit to Anthony Hopkins for his masculine portrayal of an older Zorro, Mick LaSalle, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, found that the actor's [...] "performance presents a slight problem: The film asks us to believe that no one has figured out that Zorro and his real-life persona are the same person, even though they are the only guys in Mexico who <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> British accent." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} {{believed that}} Dragon Quests one-vs-one combat system was [...] "tedious" [...] and too simple, {{and that the}} leveling system was [...] "boring", {{so they decided to}} have Dragon Quest II use a party system with players controlling multiple characters. In another game from the time entitled Wizardry, players can control a party of up to six characters directly; Nakamura saw this, liked the idea, and wanted to do something similar. Due to technical restrictions, they decided to use only three characters; the Famicom video game system supports the display of up to eight sprites side by side, and one game character used two units in a direction, so it was possible for up to three characters to <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> non-playable character (NPC). Yuji Horii believed many players would play Dragon Quest II without first playing Dragon Quest, and thus had players search for the other party members. During development, the staff discussed the idea of deprecating the [...] "stair" [...] command of the predecessor several times. Nakamura has stated that the Cave of Rhone found in the game is inspired by a classic trick to exit mazes, that of always moving forward while sticking to the right hand side wall to avoid traps.|$|E
500|$|The court then {{considered}} {{whether the}} accused had taken action that waived those rights. Waiver {{must be a}} free choice with full awareness (Moran v. Burbine). Miranda v. Arizona (the Miranda ruling) states that [...] " [...] heavy burden rests on the government {{to demonstrate that the}} defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel." [...] It was noted that the accused had read and expressed understanding of the rights, and had them read aloud, he had not pleaded lack of understanding, was given time, and therefore knew his rights. Specifically, having read the 5th warning ("you have the right to decide at any time before or during questioning to use your right to remain silent and your right to <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lawyer while you are being questioned") he was aware this right was enduring and could be applied {{at any time in the}} questioning if he chose, and the police would have to honor the invocation if he did so. The court observed that [...] "olice are not required to rewarn suspects from time to time". That a question is linked to religious beliefs does not cause the reply to be [...] "involuntary". The accused, understanding his rights and that they were capable of invocation at any point, had not chosen to invoke them.|$|E

500|$|Clarkson shares writing credits on six {{songs from}} Breakaway. [...] "Breakaway" [...] was {{included}} as the album's opening and title track. She {{described it as}} a simple song, and further explained, [...] "I think that it's simplicity is what's beautiful about it. Whenever writers or producers come to work with me, they take advantage of the fact that I can really belt it out. What's cool about 'Breakaway' is that it doesn't take advantage of that. The song just uses the simplicity of my voice. I've done country music, I've done pop, I've done gospel... all of my singles have sounded different. But this song was different from everything I've done; people didn't even know it was me!" [...] Written by Max Martin and Dr. Luke, Clarkson described the second track [...] "Since U Been Gone", as [...] "not as [...] "smooth" [...] as pop or R Clarkson said of the track, the very last to be recorded for the album, [...] "It's very emotional. Vocally, it can be a lot more challenging, but is very fun to play live." [...] Written by Clarkson, Dr. Luke, and Martin, the third track, [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes", was the last song she had co-written for the album. She recalled, [...] "I wrote 'Behind These Hazel Eyes' about my last boyfriend. It's the last song I wrote for the album, I almost didn't make the deadline." [...] The fourth track, [...] "Because of You", was originally intended for Thankful. Clarkson wrote a draft of the song after a late night <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> friend who had hard time with her family, with Moody and Hodges providing additional writing. [...] "Gone", the fifth track, was written by Kara DioGuardi and John Shanks. Clarkson admits she cannot relate thoroughly to the song, but felt that it should be heard nonetheless. The sixth track, [...] "Addicted", was written by Clarkson, Ben Moody, and David Hodges. Clarkson revealed that the song was inspired by the songs featured on Evanescence's debut album Fallen (2003). She remarked, [...] "I wanted to work with someone as passionate about music as I am. And then I heard that Evanescence record... I loved their record because of the passion behind it.|$|E
2500|$|A month later, LaRouche held a {{press conference}} to accuse the Soviet government, British government, drug dealers, {{international}} bankers, and journalists of being involved in a variety of conspiracies. Flanked by bodyguards, he said, [...] "If Abe Lincoln were alive, he'd probably be standing up here with me today," [...] {{and that there was no}} criticism of him that did not originate [...] "with the drug lobby or the Soviet operation ..." [...] He said he had been in danger from Soviet assassins for over 13 years, and had to live in safe houses. He refused to answer a question from an NBC reporter, saying [...] "How can I <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> drug pusher like you?" [...] He called the leadership of the United States [...] "idiotic" [...] and [...] "berserk," [...] and its foreign policy [...] "criminal or insane." [...] He warned of the imminent collapse of the banking system and accused banks of laundering drug money. Asked about the movement's finances, he said [...] "I don't know. ... I'm not responsible, I'm not involved in that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Karen Silkwood {{died in a}} car {{accident}} on November 13, 1974, while on her way to <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Times reporter about the safety violations at the Crescent plant. [...] Alerted to suspicious aspects of the accident, Mazzocchi permitted the use of OCAW funds to hire a former police officer-turned-private investigator to examine the accident scene and Silkwood's car. [...] After the investigator found evidence that Silkwood's car may have been forced off the road and that Silkwood was awake when the crash occurred (rather than asleep at the wheel as Oklahoma state police had concluded), Mazzocchi asked the Attorney General William B. Saxbe on November 19, 1974, to investigate Silkwood's death. [...] Mazzocchi also released a statement to the press, prematurely as it turned out: The private investigator's report had not yet been written, and the press release exposed the investigator to harassment and press mis-reporting which severely muddled OCAW's case that Silkwood may have been murdered. When the AEC concluded that Silkwood had not been contaminated accidentally, Mazzocchi was pleased with the result. He was not pleased when the AEC refused any attempt to try to discover how she had been poisoned. The Attorney General closed the investigation into Silkwood's death on April 30, 1975, saying {{there was no evidence of}} foul play.|$|E
