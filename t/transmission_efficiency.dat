25|$|Green {{vehicles}} {{are intended to}} have less environmental impact than equivalent standard vehicles, although when {{the environmental impact of}} a vehicle is assessed over the whole of its life cycle {{this may not be the}} case. Electric vehicle technology has the potential to reduce transport CO2 emissions, depending on the embodied energy of the vehicle and the source of the electricity. The primary sources of electricity currently used in most countries (coal, gas, oil) mean that until world electricity production changes substantially, private electric cars will result in the same or higher production of CO2 than petrol equivalent vehicles. The Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV), developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), is an electric vehicle that can be charged while stationary or driving, thus removing the need to stop at a charging station. The City of Gumi in South Korea runs a 24km roundtrip along which the bus will receive 100kW (136 horsepower) electricity at an 85% maximum power <b>transmission</b> <b>efficiency</b> rate while maintaining a 17cm air gap between the underbody of the vehicle and the road surface.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Laminated {{composites}} with {{a frequency}} selective surfaces (FSS) or more complex metamaterials are potential radome materials {{due to their}} unique characteristics of electromagnetic wave transmission. For making high-temperature resistant radomes, metamaterials or laminated composites with an FSS {{should be based on}} ceramic substrates. However, the processing methods for ceramic metamaterials are very limited and the conventionally used LTCC technique suffers from the shortcoming of large sintering shrinkage rates, which unfortunately impede the production of ceramic-based metamaterials. In this paper, a novel method of a low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technique combined with a technique of ceramic joining via green tapes was developed to fabricate the fused silica ceramic laminates sandwiched with the FSS. It was found that the newly developed composites with the FSS unit cells of the Ag-Pd strips exhibited near zero shrinkage of the unit cells, showed predictable <b>transmission</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of electromagnetic microwaves, and were able to overcome the poor <b>transmission</b> <b>efficiencies</b> below 11 GHz of the pure fused silica ceramic plates with an identical thickness...|$|R

Doubling the f-number decreases the relative brightness by a factor of four. [...] To maintain the same photographic exposure when doubling the f-number, the exposure time would need to be four times as long.|$|E
2500|$|Stiffness (or elastic modulus) can {{in theory}} affect the ride comfort and power <b>transmission</b> <b>efficiency.</b> [...] In practice, because even a very {{flexible}} frame {{is much more}} stiff than the tires and saddle, ride comfort is ultimately more a factor of saddle choice, frame geometry, tire choice, and bicycle fit. [...] Lateral stiffness is far more difficult to achieve because of the narrow profile of a frame, and too much flexibility can affect power transmission, primarily through tire scrub on the road due to rear triangle distortion, brakes rubbing on the rims and the chain rubbing on gear mechanisms. [...] In extreme cases gears can change themselves when the rider applies high torque out of the saddle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} (and also, the highest-amplitude) waveform {{that can}} be produced by a two-level converter is a square wave; however this would produce unacceptable levels of harmonic distortion, so some form of Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is always used to improve the harmonic distortion of the converter. As {{a result of the}} PWM, the IGBTs are switched on and off many times (typically 20) in each mains cycle. This results in high switching losses in the IGBTs and reduces the overall <b>transmission</b> <b>efficiency.</b> [...] Several different PWM strategies are possible for HVDC but in all cases the efficiency of the two-level converter is significantly poorer than that of a LCC because of the higher switching losses. A typical LCC HVDC converter station has power losses of around 0.7% at full load (per end, excluding the HVDC line or cable) while with 2-level voltage-source converters the equivalent figure is 2-3% per end.|$|E

2500|$|In {{inductive}} coupling (electromagnetic induction or inductive power transfer, IPT), power is transferred between coils of wire by a magnetic field. [...] The {{transmitter and receiver}} coils together form a transformer (see diagram). An alternating current (AC) through the transmitter coil (L1) creates an oscillating magnetic field (B) by Ampere's law. [...] The magnetic field [...] passes through the receiving coil (L2), where it induces an alternating EMF (voltage) by Faraday's law of induction, which creates an alternating current in the receiver. [...] The induced alternating current may either drive the load directly, or be rectified to direct current (DC) by a rectifier in the receiver, which drives the load. [...] A few systems, such as electric toothbrush charging stands, work at [...] 50/60Hz so AC mains current is applied directly to the transmitter coil, but in most systems an electronic oscillator generates a higher frequency AC current which drives the coil, because <b>transmission</b> <b>efficiency</b> improves with frequency.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ratio of}} active power to {{apparent}} {{power in a}} circuit is called the power factor. For two systems transmitting {{the same amount of}} active power, the system with the lower power factor will have higher circulating currents due to energy that returns to the source from energy storage in the load. These higher currents produce higher losses and reduce overall <b>transmission</b> <b>efficiency.</b> [...] A lower power factor circuit will have a higher apparent power and higher losses for the same amount of active power. The power factor is 1.0 when the voltage and current are in phase. [...] It is zero when the current leads or lags the voltage by 90 degrees. Power factors are usually stated as [...] "leading" [...] or [...] "lagging" [...] to show the sign of the phase angle of current with respect to voltage. Voltage is designated as the base to which current angle is compared, meaning that we think of current as either [...] "leading" [...] or [...] "lagging" [...] voltage. Where the waveforms are purely sinusoidal, the power factor is the cosine of the phase angle (φ) between the current and voltage sinusoid waveforms. Equipment data sheets and nameplates will often abbreviate power factor as [...] "" [...] for this reason.|$|E
2500|$|Edison's {{direct current}} {{generation}} dominated the initial years of indoor commercial and residential electric lighting and electric power distribution. However, DC transmission was hampered by the difficulty in changing voltages between industrial generation and residential/commercial consumption and the low voltages used suffered from poor <b>transmission</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The mid 1880s saw {{the introduction of the}} transformer, allowing alternating current to be transmitted at high voltage long distances with greater efficiency and then [...] "stepped down" [...] to supply commercial and domestic indoor lighting, resulting in AC going from being the outdoor [...] "arc lighting current" [...] to taking over the domestic lighting utility market Edison's DC system was designed to supply. The rapid spread of AC and haphazard instillation of power lines, especially in the city of New York, led to a series of deaths attributed to high voltage AC and an eventual media backlash against the current. Starting in 1888 the Edison company played up the dangers of AC power in their literature and assisted self-appointed anti-AC crusader Harold P. Brown in a parallel goal to limit, to the point of ineffectiveness, the voltages in AC power systems, a market then dominated by Westinghouse Electric. This series of events {{came to be known as}} the War of Currents. Brown/Edison's lobbying in state legislatures went nowhere and the Edison company continued to lose market share and profitability to the AC based companies. In 1892 the [...] "war" [...] ended with Thomas Edison losing any remaining control of his own company when it was merged with Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to form General Electric, creating a company that controlled three quarters of the US electrical business. Westinghouse's lead in AC development would allow them to win a contract in 1893 to build an AC based power station at the Niagara Falls but the transmission contract was awarded to General Electric, who would come to dominate the US electrical business for many years afterwards.|$|E
