5|$|The southernmost {{section of}} the road {{was known as the}} White Plains Post Road in <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nineteenth</b> centuries, a major highway {{connecting}} New York City to White Plains, the Westchester county seat.

5|$|The {{occurrence}} of disturbed behaviour {{in people with}} jaundice may have been described in antiquity by Hippocrates of Cos (ca. 460–370BCE). Celsus and Galen (first and third century respectively) both recognised the condition. Many modern descriptions {{of the link between}} liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms were made in <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century; for instance, Giovanni Battista Morgagni (1682–1771) reported in 1761 that it was a progressive condition.|$|E
5|$|Beyond Julian Park, it {{has been}} conjectured that the {{structure}} originally continued to the Roman garrison fort at Lease Rigg, south west of Sleights, based on reports from antiquarians in <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nineteenth</b> centuries that fragments were visible at numerous points along this course. Hayes and Rutter appear confident of the structure's extent as far as Lease Rigg, but admit that its extent is conjectural from well short of that point, from Dowson Garth Quarry northwards.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th {{century the}} gorge was quarried to produce {{building}} stone for the city. Stone {{was taken by}} boat into the floating harbour. In the 19th century celestine was discovered in Leigh Court estate and the Miles family authorised quarrying. Between 1880 and 1920 Bristol was producing 90% of the world's Celestine, but the enterprise {{did not last long}} into the 20th century. Bristol Diamonds, brilliant quartz crystals found in geodes in dolomitic conglomerate in the gorge, were popular souvenirs for visitors to the Hotwells spa in <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nineteenth</b> centuries. Quarries on the Bristol side of the gorge are now popular with climbers and are a habitat for Peregrine falcons and other wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Inside the church, an {{intricate}} five-tier icon screen funded by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky and executed by Hryhoryi Petriv from Chernigov {{was installed in}} 1718. During <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nineteenth</b> centuries, {{almost all of the}} original Byzantine mosaics and frescoes on the interior walls were painted over. Some restoration work on the mosaics and frescoes that remained unpainted was carried out {{towards the end of the}} nineteenth century. However, there were no major and serious investigations of the walls done, so it is possible that medieval frescoes or mosaics were preserved under the newer coats of plaster.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} {{has been the}} subject of folklore in the surrounding area for several hundred years and possibly more than a millennium. Its construction was commonly attributed to a giant known as Wade, a figure from Germanic or Norse mythology. In the 1720s the causeway was mentioned in a published text and became known outside the local area. Within a few years it became of interest to antiquarians who visited the site and exchanged commentary on its probable historicity. They interpreted the structure as a causeway across marshy ground, attributing its construction to the Roman military, an explanation largely unchallenged throughout <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nineteenth</b> centuries.|$|E

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nineteenth</b> centuries, {{the mound}} of Cubzac was slashed all around to provide stone for Bordeaux's {{construction}} and the ballast of some river banks, creating deep excavations in the limestone. In 1898, André Cousteau, uncle of the researcher and ecologist Jacques Cousteau, started using the caves to make a sparkling wine based on traditional Champagne-making techniques. The wine, treated in a closed tank, bottled, and kept neck down many months at constant temperature, became bubbly and had its impurities accumulate near the cap. Once this deposit was removed, the bottles were resealed by force, and the corks muzzled. In 1920, the Cousteau property was sold to the Société Anonyme Gay-Mousse. In 1966, the caves where entrusted to Monsieur Lateyron who, one year later, created the Café de Paris.|$|E
