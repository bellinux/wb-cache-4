500|$|Kelpie myths usually {{describe}} a solitary creature, but a fairy story recorded by John F. Campbell in Popular Tales of the West Highlands (1860) {{has a different}} perspective. Entitled Of the Drocht na Vougha or Fuoah, which is given the translation of {{the bridge of the}} fairies or kelpies, it features a group of voughas. The spirits had set about constructing a bridge over the Dornoch Firth after becoming tired of travelling across the water in cockleshells. It was a magnificent piece of work resplendent with gold piers and posts, but sank into the water to become a treacherous area of quicksand after a grateful onlooker tried to bless the kelpies for their work. The same story is recorded by Folklore Society member and folklore collector Charlotte Dempster simply as The Kelpie's Bridge (1888) with no mention of Voughas or Fuoah.

[...] Wired Kathy Ceceri also noted an artistic similarity to Persepolis; she not only liked how Anya's Ghost intertwined the teenage angst and fantasy elements of the novel, but praised how Anya's desire for a boyfriend doesn't overwhelm the story. [...] Cory Doctorow reviewed Anya's Ghost for Boing Boing, calling it [...] "really sweet, really funny and really scary, [...] a powerful message about identity, fitting in, and the secret selfish bastard lurking in all of us and whether having such a goblin inside makes us irredeemable or merely human." [...] Whitney Matheson with USA Today wrote that Anya's Ghost is a [...] "funny, creepy and a delightful page-turner" [...] and cited author Neil Gaiman who called the novel [...] "a masterpiece".
