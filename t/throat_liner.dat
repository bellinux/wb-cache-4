40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to define the solid rocket booster (SRB) nozzle throat flow field, and to investigate one possible mechanism for the severe erosion which occurred on a recent flight. The flow field {{in the vicinity of}} the eroded area was not found to be exceptional, and the presence of a notch or scored area near the imbedded region nose did not appear to produce sufficient flow fluctuations to exacerbate the erosion characteristics of the <b>throat</b> <b>liner.</b> An interesting fluctuating mechanism was found in the imbedded cavity, but that mechanism (while of possible importance for erosion of the seal region) did not seem to adversely affect the region of concern. On the basis of this analysis, the conclusion can be drawn that the anomalous erosion did not result from a single mechanical defect (pit, or gouge) since the flow fluctuations which result seem insufficient to induce a repetitive pattern downstream. It further appears that the emission pattern exhibited did not result from a steady flow phenomena in the throat region. This does not rule out acoustic phenomena or severe start-up transients...|$|E

25|$|The {{first stage}} {{was to have}} been a more {{powerful}} and reusable solid fuel rocket derived from the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB). Compared with the Solid Rocket Booster, which had four segments, the most notable difference was the addition of a fifth segment. This fifth segment would have enabled the Ares I to produce more thrust. Other changes made to the Solid Rocket Booster were to have been the removal of the Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) attachment points and the replacement of the Solid Rocket Booster nosecone with a new forward adapter that would have interfaced with the liquid-fueled second stage. The adapter {{was to have been}} equipped with solid-fueled separation motors to facilitate the disconnection of the stages during ascent. The grain design was also changed, and so were the insulation and liner. By the Ares I first stage ground test, the case, grain design, number of segments, insulation, <b>liner,</b> <b>throat</b> diameter, thermal protection systems and nozzle had all changed.|$|R
40|$|Summary. [...] The {{theory of}} the flow through a throat near sonic {{velocity}} is developed, and {{is followed by a}} discussion of the conventional method of designing supersonic nozzles using the method of characteristics. A method of improving the Mach number distribution of the nozzle using the experimental results is deveJoped. The nozzles designed were tested in a 3 -in. square wind tunnel in which the Mack number distribution was obtained by shaping the top wall of the working-section. The Mack number distribution along the bottom wall was determined from the pressures measured by a series of static pressure holes along the wall. Considerable difficulty was found in improving the distribution; this was considered to be due to the discontinuity in curvature at the point of inflexion and the influence on the boundary layer of the sudden relaxation of the pressure gradient along the wall. An alternative method of design was developed which avoided this discontinuity in curvature, and considerably better results were obtained when attempts were made to improve the experimental Mack number distribution. Ttle flow through the <b>throat</b> of the <b>liners</b> was determined experimentally and compared with the theory. The agreement was good on the whole, although there were differences in the subsonic entry region because the bottom wall only became flat a short distance before the throat. In addition, tests were made which showed that the assumption of two-dimensional flow through the throat was j astified...|$|R
