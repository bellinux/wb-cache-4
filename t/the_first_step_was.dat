5|$|The Canary Islands were colonised in two waves. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> the {{occupation}} of Tenerife and La Gomera 1.9–2.3 million years ago, followed by a separate invasion of El Hierro and La Palma 1.3–1.8 mya.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{a precise}} {{characterization}} of the error in the main mirror. Working backwards from images of point sources, astronomers determined that the conic constant of the mirror as built was , instead of the intended −1.00230. The same number was also derived by analyzing the null corrector used by Perkin-Elmer to figure the mirror, {{as well as by}} analyzing interferograms obtained during ground testing of the mirror.|$|E
5|$|Marshall and Nichols began {{assembling}} the resources they would need. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{to obtain a}} high priority rating for the project. The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in descending order, although {{there was also a}} special AAA rating reserved for emergencies. Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel Lucius D. Clay, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although he was willing to provide a AAA rating on request for critical materials if the need arose. Nichols and Marshall were disappointed; AA-3 was the same priority as Nichols' TNT plant in Pennsylvania.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{to secure}} {{retirement}} benefits for custodians throughout the state. In 1928, {{just a year}} after CSEA formed, the union helped push through SB 551, which allowed school districts to establish retirement benefits for all school employees, not just teachers. More importantly, it became the first law on the books recognizing school employees other than teachers and administrators.|$|E
25|$|Through {{more than}} 70 {{years as a}} {{functional}} but neglected government building, the Palace fell into disrepair. After Hawaii became a state, Governor John A. Burns began an effort to restore the palace in the 1960s. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to move the former Iolani Barracks building from its original position northeast of the palace. It now serves as a visitors center for the palace.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{to connect}} Buenos Aires and the Fortines (fortresses) with {{telegraph}} lines. The government signed {{a peace treaty}} with chieftain Juan José Catriel. But he broke it a short time later, as together with chieftain Namuncurá and 3,500 warriors, he attacked Tres Arroyos, Tandil, Azul, and other towns and farms. The casualties were higher than in 1872: Catriel and Namuncurá's forces killed 400 settlers, captured 300, and drove off 300,000 head of cattle.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{undertaken}} {{with careful}} {{concern for the}} environment, including monitoring by specialized consultants, since the region has a rich archeological heritage. Among the hundreds of caverns in the region, the one at Lapa Vermelha stands out. Located 2.7km (1.6mi) from the airport, the oldest female cranium in the Americans was discovered there, dated at roughly 12 thousand years old. Confins is certified by the ISO 9001 standard, covering ten processes in the administrative, operational, safety/security and maintenance areas.|$|E
25|$|These {{goals for}} {{structural}} change could have improved {{the efficiency of}} resource allocation while doing {{a great deal to}} lessen poverty. But the goals clearly required both time and the ability to restore expansion without worsening inflation and external deficits. The government initially emphasized such macroeconomic objectives as necessary conditions for the structural changes. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to stop the built-in inflationary process, but to do it without adopting orthodox measures of monetary and fiscal restraint.|$|E
25|$|In November 2010, the Gorham's Cave complex was {{put forward}} {{to compete for}} a {{nomination}} as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Professor Clive Finlayson, director of the Gibraltar Museum, was responsible for co-ordinating the efforts to obtain this nomination. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> a proposal to the United Kingdom cultural authorities to get Gorham's Cave complex added to the UK's World Heritage Tentative List. Such a list is revised every ten years, and the process for a new list was ongoing at {{the date of the}} submission.|$|E

25|$|The Church of the Presidents is {{the last}} {{remaining}} structure associated with all seven presidents who vacationed in Long Branch. In 1999 the Long Branch Historical Museum Association began fundraising efforts to save the building. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to stabilize the building {{to prevent it from}} collapsing. The wood flooring was removed and reinforced concrete was poured to support the building. Steel supports replaced wooden pilasters that had deteriorated. The stained-glass windows, original altar, organ, and handmade pews were removed and put in storage during renovation.|$|E
25|$|General Jan Christiaan Smuts, {{a member}} of the Imperial War Cabinet, was sent to confer with Allenby {{regarding}} the implementation of a French qualification to the War Office's Joint Note No. 12—that no troops from France could be redeployed to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. Smuts was {{on his way back to}} London in February when <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> taken to accomplish his suggestion of crossing the Jordan River and capturing the Hedjaz Railway, and the front line was extended eastwards with the successful capture of Jericho.|$|E
25|$|After the 1930s, Dallas was {{controlled}} {{in all aspects}} by the Dallas Citizens Council, {{a group of about}} two hundred men who had both achieved unusual success in their careers and demonstrated an unusual willingness to work on projects they believed would help build a great city. In 1954 with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to end racial segregation in public schools, the Citizens Council soon acknowledged that desegregation was inevitable, and they sought {{to make the best of}} it. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> the formation of the Biracial Committee. For the most part, the Citizens Council had already decided what to do, and the Biracial Committee helped get it done. They decided to prepare for school desegregation by desegregating the community bit by bit.|$|E

25|$|Loading a {{submarine}} was a lengthy process that took weeks. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to pump the forward ballast tanks empty which elevated the bow {{out of the}} water. Once it was dismantled, the ballast tanks were then filled to lower the bow and flood the well deck to allow the submarine to be winched aboard. The well deck's water-tight doors were then closed and {{the water in the}} dock was pumped overboard while the submarine settled onto its wooden bilge blocks. The bow was then reassembled and hatch covers were installed over the well deck. These prevented the ship from taking on water during a storm and allowed the crew to perform any necessary maintenance on the submarine while under way.|$|E
25|$|During the {{communist}} era, travelling to the West {{was a long}} process for Hungarian citizens. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to obtain an invitation, preferably from a relative {{in the country to}} be visited, and a promise of full financial support. With such an invitation, and assuming he could get a passport, a Hungarian could travel westwards once a year. However, in the absence of such an invitation, he could travel to the West only once every three years. The Communist-era visa restrictions restricted Hungarian artists and musicians since it hindered their ability to travel abroad. As a result, many chose to leave Hungary and settle in the West, such as famed cellist János Starker, who emigrated to the United States in 1948 because it was impossible for him to tour abroad with a Hungarian passport.|$|E
25|$|In the {{build-up}} to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, {{community interest}} in local football {{was at an}} all-time high and the Pro League garnered praise for its development of homegrown professional footballers. As a result, the league implemented a series of marketing plans in 2006 to establish itself as a viable professional league. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to increase league membership back to ten teams with the arrivals of Joe Public, South Starworld Strikers, and Superstar Rangers. The Pro League also established its reserve league in 2007 for players that were previously on the bench during league matches to have a league of their own to show scouts their skills on the field. Each member of the Pro League can have their respective reserve team participate in the under-18 league.|$|E

25|$|By 2005 NorskeCanada had {{operated}} with {{a deficit}} in 13 of 19 quarters, and Norske Skog started considering its {{options for the}} company. Pöyry was hired to consider the operations, {{and concluded that the}} mills were not competitive for export to Asia, a prime target market for Norske Skog. The paper particularly emphasized inefficient mill designs which subsequently led to higher operating costs. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> taken in October 2005, when the general meeting approved the new name, Catalyst Paper, to signal that the group was leaving Norske Skog. The Norwegian group sold its 29.4 percent of Catalyst for $186 million in a bought deal on 30 January 2006. At the time Catalyst's four mills made it North America's fourth-largest producer of printing papers, with an annual production of two million tonnes of paper and half a million tonnes of kraft pulp.|$|E
25|$|The first {{plans for}} {{conversion}} {{were developed in}} 1903 and eight years later the first money grants were issued. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> establishing dual gauge from Hamar to Elverum. Work commenced in 1914 and involved elevating the track at places and moving buildings further from the line. Elverum received a new station facility in 1913. The work between Hamar and Elverum was delayed and instead the section from Elverum to Rena opened with dual gauge first, on 7 November 1917. The dual gauge was completed to Hamar on 29 November 1919. The conversion cost 1.4 million kroner, but would save NSB about 400,000 kroner per year. Twenty freight cars would be freed up. Passenger trains operating between Hamar and Elverum were standard gauge, while narrow gauge was used for through trains. Standard gauge trains, and not just freight cars, could operate to Rena from 1926.|$|E
25|$|Dashwood {{found out}} that there were three privateers at Mariel, a little west of Havana, and {{decided to try to}} capture them. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to send in Bacchantes boats to take a round tower that was {{protecting}} the harbour. The tower stood 40' high, had three 24-pounders on its top, loopholes for muskets around its circumference, and had a garrison of a captain and 30 men. The attack commenced in the evening of 5 April, with the British capturing the fort despite heavy fire. The 13 British seamen and marines suffered one man wounded before they landed; the Spanish had two killed and three wounded. Leaving a sergeant and six marines to guard the prisoners, the boats then headed into the harbour. There they discovered that the privateers had left the day before. Still, despite heavy small-arms fire, the British succeeded in bringing out two schooners carrying sugar.|$|E
