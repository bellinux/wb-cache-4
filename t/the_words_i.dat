500|$|Following {{the success}} of The Dark Knight, Eckhart next {{appeared}} in Alan Ball's Towelhead (2008), an adaption of the Alicia Erian novel of the same name, in which he played a Gulf War Army reservist who sexually abuses his 13-year-old Arab-American neighbor. The film was screened under the name Nothing is Private at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. When he was first approached for the role, Eckhart revealed {{that he did not}} want to play a [...] "pedophile". When asked about the sex scenes, Eckhart said: [...] "Those were difficult times.... The way I did it was to really trust Alan. It was in <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> <b>I</b> really trusted Summer , and I tried to get her to trust me, to build a relationship when we were doing physical scenes. We'd really rehearse them mechanically, and I'd say, 'OK, I'm going to put my hand here, I'm going to do this.'... I think I found it more difficult." [...] Towelhead was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|In August 1975, Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old Kings Road habitué John Lydon {{wearing a}} Pink Floyd T-shirt with <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>I</b> Hate {{handwritten}} above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes. Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon {{to come to}} a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook. According to Jones, [...] "He came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins. John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart." [...] When the pub closed, the group moved on to SEX, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper's [...] "I'm Eighteen" [...] on the shop jukebox. Though the performance drove the band members to laughter, McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon. Lydon later described the social context in which the band came together: ...|$|E
500|$|Barlow {{had arrived}} in the United States in February 1997 for {{recording}} the track, where Clive Davis, who was managing his career in the United States, played him a [...] "poppier" [...] version of the song, remixed by Junior Vasquez. He also requested Barlow to perform [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] at the 1997 pre-Grammy Award party. However, the singer did not have any time to rehearse or memorize the lyrics, resulting in the performance receiving negative reviews from critics and audience alike. With The Times Barlow recounted the evening saying, [...] "I don't remember <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> <b>I</b> came in at all the wrong times. I can see people drifting off to the toilet in droves. Talk about dying on your arse!" [...] The combination of the negative review towards his performance and contractual obligations led to Barlow release [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] as his second single on 24 April 1997 in the United Kingdom. The CD single consisted of the single version along with the Vasquez remix and two other tracks from Open Road, [...] "Meaning Of A Love Song" [...] and [...] "Always". Another song, [...] "Cuddly Toy", was released on the B-side of another CD single for the song, released in May 1997. [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] was also remixed by DJs Cuca and Monster Makers, and was released in a CD single in June 1997.|$|E

500|$|In December 1986, Bono {{stated that}} he had a love–hate {{relationship}} with America, and that this influenced his work on the album. Speaking of his encounter with COMADRES in El Salvador and their impact on the song, he said, [...] "There's {{no question in my mind}} of the Reagan Administration's involvement in backing the regime that is committing these atrocities. I doubt if the people of America are even aware of this. It's not my position to lecture them or tell them their place or to even open their eyes up to it in a very visual way, but it is affecting me and it affects <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>I</b> write and the music we make." [...] In 2007, Clayton noted [...] "We were looking at this America through a European lens, at a time when Britain was under Margaret Thatcher who was breaking the miners.... So we were singing from the same hymn sheet as the Clash but with our spotlight focused on injustice inside and outside America." [...] He said [...] "'Mothers of the Disappeared' was not just a reflection on what had happened under the military government in Chile but also at the US which had supported that government", and described Bono's vocals as [...] "prehistoric", saying [...] "it connects with something very primitive." ...|$|E
500|$|Phill Udel of State said that, {{with the}} song, Girls Aloud [...] "have managed to {{maintain}} the quality" [...] they had prior {{to the release of}} Ten, and commented that [...] "the other three new songs are nowhere near up to the same standard." [...] Idolator blogger Sam Lansky commented that, for the fans, [...] "Something New" [...] is [...] "a welcome relief to [...] have an injection of fresh energy into the stagnant girl group scene," [...] and concluded that, [...] "given that this may be the group's final single before disbanding for good, they're certainly going out on a high note, with a track that feels quintessentially Aloud but retooled for 2012." [...] Rebecca Twomey of Marie Claire said that the group is [...] "on key with the current trend for dance music with their new song," [...] while noting that they have [...] "clearly taken inspiration from Cheryl's Call My Name." [...] Katy Brand of The Daily Telegraph was critical towards the song. Brand said that the lyrics [...] "are the usual post-Spice fare," [...] but commented that [...] "the images weren't quite matching <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> <b>I</b> was hearing the battle cry of enraged queens who will be oppressed no longer; I was watching five young women wearing identical orange mini-dresses, strutting up and down in perfect synchronicity, like catwalk models." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many hip hop {{artists and}} rappers use scat singing {{to come up}} with the rhythms of their raps. Tajai of the group Souls of Mischief states the {{following}} in the book How to Rap: [...] "Sometimes my rhythms come from scatting. I usually make a scat kind of skeleton and then fill in <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> <b>I</b> make a skeleton of the flow first, and then I put words into it." [...] The group Lifesavas describe a similar process. Rapper Tech N9ne has been recorded demonstrating exactly how this method works, in an audio segment covered by The Washington Post. Gangsta rapper Eazy-E uses it extensively in his song [...] "Eazy Street".|$|E

[...] I said [...] "Damn it, if I had an axe, I'd cut the cable right now." [...] But I was at fault. I was the MC, and I could have said to the part of the crowd that booed Bob, [...] "you didn't boo Howlin' Wolf yesterday. He was electric!" [...] Though I still prefer to hear Dylan acoustic, some of his electric songs are absolutely great. Electric music is the vernacular of {{the second half of the}} twentieth century, to use my father's old term.|$|E

2500|$|An {{experimental}} line, with a sixth return wire, was run {{between the}} Euston terminus and Camden Town station of the London and North Western Railway on 25 July 1837. The actual distance {{was only one}} and a half-mile (2.4km), but spare wire had been inserted in the circuit to increase its length. It {{was late in the}} evening before the trial took place. Mr Cooke was in charge at Camden Town, while Mr Robert Stephenson and other gentlemen looked on; and Wheatstone sat at his instrument in a dingy little room, lit by a tallow candle, near the booking-office at Euston. Wheatstone sent the first message, to which Cooke replied, and 'never' said Wheatstone, 'did I feel such a tumultuous sensation before, as when, all alone in the still room, I heard the needles click, and as I spelled <b>the</b> <b>words,</b> <b>I</b> felt all the magnitude of the invention pronounced to be practicable beyond cavil or dispute.' ...|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, Trump {{benefited from}} free media {{more than any}} other candidate. From the {{beginning}} of his campaign through February 2016, Trump received almost $2 billion in free media attention, twice the amount that Clinton received. According to data from the Tyndall Report, which tracks nightly news content, through February 2016, Trump alone accounted for {{more than a quarter of}} all 2016 election coverage on the evening newscasts of NBC, CBS and ABC, more than all the Democratic campaigns combined. Observers noted Trump's ability to garner constant mainstream media coverage [...] "almost at will". However, Trump frequently criticized the media for writing what he alleged to be false stories about him and he has called upon his supporters to be [...] "the silent majority". Trump also said the media [...] "put false meaning into <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>I</b> say", and says he does not mind being criticized by the media as long as they are honest about it.|$|E

Speaking in an American accent, she circled the podium and gave a speech about Robbie Williams, {{who had been the}} target of earlier jokes made by host Russell Brand. Williams had been reported as going into rehabilitation that same week. As her speech continued, she made remarks about Brand, implying that he was heading for rehabilitation himself (while singing a passage of Amy Winehouse's hit [...] "Rehab"). In response to the British media's reaction, Stone responded, [...] "At the end of the day, I don't give a fuck if people have a problem with my accent. That's all I can say about it. <b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>I</b> say do not change. If the way that it sounds is skew-wiff and you don't like it, don't listen.

2500|$|In {{the gospel}} of John, however, {{the account of the}} Last Supper does not mention Jesus taking bread and [...] "the cup" [...] and {{speaking}} of them as his body and blood; instead, it recounts other events: his humble act of washing the disciples' feet, the prophecy of the betrayal, which set in motion the events that would lead to the cross, and his long discourse in response to some questions posed by his followers, in which he went on to speak {{of the importance of the}} unity of the disciples with him and each other. In , the evangelist attributes a long discourse to Jesus that deals with the subject of the living bread and in [...] contains echoes of Eucharistic language. The interpretation of the whole passage has been extensively debated due to theological and scholarly disagreements. Sir Edwyn Hoskyns notes three main schools of thought: (a) the language is metaphorical, and verse 63: [...] "The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. <b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>I</b> have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life" [...] gives the author's precise meaning; (b) vv 51-58 are a later interpolation that cannot be harmonized with the context; (c) the discourse is homogeneous, sacrificial, and sacramental and can be harmonized, though not all attempts are satisfactory.|$|E
2500|$|Referred to as a [...] "stoner rap" [...] by Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{the lyrics}} are mostly nonsensical. The song's chorus, in which Beck sings the lines [...] "Soy un perdedor/I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?", is often {{interpreted}} as a parody of Generation X's [...] "slacker" [...] culture. Beck has denied the validity of this meaning, instead saying that the chorus is simply about his lack of skill as a rapper. Jon Pareles wrote in The New York Times that [...] "The sentiment of 'Loser' [...] reflects the twentysomething trademark, a mixture of self-mockery and sardonic defiance", noting Beck's [...] "offhand vocal tone and free-associative lyrics" [...] and comparing his vocals to [...] "Bob Dylan talk-singing". After its recording, Beck thought that the song was interesting but unimpressive. He later said, [...] "The raps and vocals are all first takes. If I’d known the impact {{it was going to}} make, I would have put something a little more substantial in it." [...] The relationship between Beck and Stephenson soured after the release of [...] "Loser" [...] as a single. Stephenson regretted his involvement in creating the song, in particular the [...] "negative" [...] lyrics, saying [...] "I feel bad about it. It's not Beck the person, it's <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> <b>I</b> just wish I could have been more of a positive influence." ...|$|E
