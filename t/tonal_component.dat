50|$|The steel-string {{acoustic}} guitar {{evolved from the}} nylon- or gut-string classical guitar, and because steel strings have higher tension, heavier construction is required overall. One innovation is a metal bar called a truss rod, which is incorporated into the neck to strengthen it and provide adjustable counter-tension to {{the stress of the}} strings. Typically, a steel-string {{acoustic guitar}} is built with a larger soundbox than a standard classical guitar. A critical structural and <b>tonal</b> <b>component</b> of an acoustic guitar is the bracing, a systems of struts glued {{to the inside of the}} back and top. Steel-string guitars use different bracing systems from classical guitars, typically using X-bracing instead of fan bracing. (Another simpler system, called ladder bracing, where the braces are all placed across the width of the instrument, is used on all types of flat-top guitars on the back.) Innovations in bracing design have emerged, notably the A-brace developed by British luthier Roger Bucknall of Fylde Guitars.|$|E

However, the current European legislation regarding professional exposure to {{the noise of the}} workers, and namely the EU Directive 2003 / 10 /CE, does not take into consideration the possible presence of pure tones in working noise. The same lack can be noticed in the standard ISO 1999 : 2013. As regards seafarers, the reference codes are the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Resolution A. 468 (XII) for ships built before 1 July 2014, and Resolution MSC. 337 (91) for newer ships. While <b>tonal</b> <b>components</b> are mentioned in the first one, stating that, if these are "obvious", the ISO noise rating (NR) number should be also determined, in the latter and most recent IMO Resolution no reference to <b>tonal</b> <b>components</b> is present. <b>Tonal</b> <b>components</b> cause annoyance and, at the same time, they induce hearing damage and can alter the behavior of workers, with a potential risk for the safety of ships. In this study, noise measurements taken onboard different ships are analyzed in order to determine seafarers' work exposure to <b>tonal</b> <b>components.</b> The survey includes different work spaces. To assess the presence of <b>tonal</b> <b>components</b> in crew's work environments the methodology of environmental noise analysis, defined in the Annex B of Italian Decree D.

The method used in order to evaluate <b>tonal</b> <b>components</b> is well established for the environmental noise annoyance and therefore it can be operatively extended to the workplace noise exposure.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the roles of steady-state speech sounds and transitions between these sounds in the intelligibility of speech. The motivation for this approach is that the auditory system may be particularly sensitive to time-varying frequency edges, which in speech are produced primarily by transitions between vowels and consonants and within vowels. The possibility that selectively amplifying these edges may enhance speech intelligibility is examined. Computer algorithms to decompose speech into two different components were developed. One component, which is defined as a <b>tonal</b> <b>component,</b> was intended to predominately include formant activity. The second component, which is defined as a non-tonal component, was intended to predominately include transitions between and within formants. The approach to the decomposition is to use a set of time-varying filters whose center frequencies and bandwidths are controlled to identify the strongest formant components in speech. Each center frequency and bandwidth is estimated based on FM and AM information of each formant component. The <b>tonal</b> <b>component</b> is composed of the sum of the filter outputs. The non-tonal component is defined as the difference between the original speech signal and the <b>tonal</b> <b>component.</b> The relative energy and intelligibility of the tonal and non-tonal components were compared to the original speech. Psychoacoustic growth functions were used to assess the intelligibility. Most of the speech energy was in the <b>tonal</b> <b>component,</b> but this component had a significantly lower maximum word recognition than the original and non-tonal component had. The non-tonal component averaged 2 % of the original speech energy, but this component had almost equal maximum word recognition as the original speech. The non-tonal component was amplified and recombined with the original speech to generate enhanced speech. The energy of the enhanced speech was adjusted to be equal to the original speech, and the intelligibility of the enhanced speech was compared to the original speech in background noise. The enhanced speech showed higher recognition scores at lower SNRs, and the differences were significant. The original and enhanced speech showed similar recognition scores at higher SNRs. These results suggest that amplification of transient information can enhance the speech in noise and this enhancement method is more effective at severe noise conditions...|$|E

40|$|Miniflaps at the {{trailing}} edge of airfoils (i. e., Gurney flaps) change the Kutta condition and thus produce higher lift. Unfortunately, however, the drag also increases {{due to the}} flow separation downstream of such modified trailing edges. The present work describes investigations aimed at the stabilization of the wake flow in order to achieve drag reduction and a decrease of sound generation. Using hot wire velocimetry, the existence of a <b>tonal</b> <b>component</b> could be observed in the broadband spectrum of the velocity fluctuations downstream of the Gurney flap. This points to the occurrence of a von Kárman vortex street (i. e., an absolute instability). This phenomenon persists even for turbulent boundary layers on the airfoil. Geometrical modifications of the Gurney flaps can reduce or eliminate the instability of the flow and can thus reduce or eliminate the existence of the <b>tonal</b> <b>component</b> of the velocity fluctuations of the wake. The effectiveness of trailing edge modifications like slits in Gurney flaps was investigated experimentally. These experiments were carried out with two-dimensional airfoils. The chord Reynolds number of these experiments was Re = 1 × 106. At lower angles of attack where the instabilities did occur, the geometrical modifications produced an appreciable drag reduction. This drag reduction was determined directly by force measurements using a wind tunnel balance.

40|$|In many {{different}} applications and buildings fans {{are used to}} remove unwanted and used air. These fans often generate broadband and tonal noise. Commonly, passive resistive silencers are used to attenuate noise generated by different types of fans installed in ventilation systems. Passive silencers tend to become bulky and impractical when designed for low frequency at-tenuation. However, active noise control (ANC) is a technique known {{for its ability to}} produce high levels of attenuation in the low frequency range, even with a relatively moderate sized ANC system. This paper presents an initial study performed to investigate the possibilities of applying ANC to a radial fan installed inside a box, an insulated box fan. The box is connected to a duct system and can for example be used as a waste air fan. The primary interest in this application, when the fan is used as a waste air fan, is to attenuate the noise generated on the suction side, since that side generates noise into a particular room. Investigations were carried out to determine where the ANC system should be installed, e. g. inside the box, in the duct connected to the box etc. Factors considered were for example, turbulence, standing waves, the type of noise generated by the fan (tonal, broadband, or a combination), and space limita-tions. The noise generated by the fan was found to be dominated by a <b>tonal</b> <b>component,</b> but also to have broadband energy in the low frequency range. Further, a feedforward ANC sys-tem was applied on the suction side, producing approximately 28 dB attenuation of the <b>tonal</b> <b>component,</b> and 5 - 10 dB attenuation of the broadband noise between 50 and 200 Hz. 1...|$|E
