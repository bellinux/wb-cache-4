40|$|Inflated {{retail prices}} and {{termination}} rates for international telecommunications have spawned traffic re-routing practices, including call turnaround (e. g., callback) and re-origination via third countries. The US and other liberalized countries that allow telecom competition favor such practices, as undermining foreign monopolists. This view is seriously incomplete; re-routing practices ultimately may favor monopolists. Specifically, we show the following: (1) Re-routing practices, especially turnaround, can help foreign monopolists-allied with carriers in the US (or other liberalized markets) -to divert <b>termination</b> <b>payments</b> from nonalliance carriers by gaming the International Settlements Policy; the ISP aims to bolster competitive carriers {{in dealing with}} monopolists, by requiring equal termination rates at both ends and "proportional return" (traffic from the monopolist is terminated by US carriers in proportion to their shares of traffic to that country, not at the monopolist's discretion). (2) Gaming the ISP harms not only other carriers but typically also callers. (3) Proportional return creates distortions even without foreign gaming: it penalizes larger carriers; and because of it, callback from the US can reduce US welfare even when callback is motivated by "innocent" arbitrage. We present a simple linear-pricing alternative to the ISP that eliminates these distortions, yet benefits both countries. International Telecom, <b>Termination</b> <b>Payments,</b> Alliances...|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} model by Laffont, Rey and Tirole (1998) treats termination fees {{as an instrument}} to increase market power in a one-shot game of horizontal product differentiation. We offer an alternative view in an infinitely repeated Bertrand competition. We focus on symmetrical call-ing patterns and investigate simple two-part tariffs for two types, as well as general non-linear tariffs for two types and for a continuum of types. In this framework, termination fees make deviations from the collusive outcome less attractive. The optimum deviation strategy is usually to try to attract the high valuation customers since they exhibit the highest profits. Thus, a deviator will have a pool of high users which will have more outgoing than incoming calls, implying net <b>termination</b> <b>payments.</b> A cooperatively chosen termination rate can increase the deviator’s cost and thereby always stabilizes collusion.

40|$|A {{catalyst}} for this inquiry was concern that executive pay had {{got out of}} hand. This perception was fuelled by practices in financial institutions abroad that were seen as a key contributor to the global financial crisis. Further, while local shareholder value plummeted in 2008 {{as a result of}} that imported crisis — with some companies and sectors being propped up by taxpayers — executive pay seemed to emerge unscathed, crystallising a view that executives were being rewarded for failure (after having been rewarded for success). This has come on top of longstanding community discomfort about the widening gap between the remuneration of executives and other employees, as well as some large <b>termination</b> <b>payments</b> with perceived lack of justification. Public opinion polling over the years consistently shows that most respondents believe executives to be overpaid. But polls also reveal limited awareness of the drivers of executive pay and wealth creation. Accordingly, this inquiry was tasked with ascertaining what has actually happened to executive pay in Australia’s publicly-listed companies, as well as identifying what can and should be done about it. The appropriate test for any policy intervention is that it promotes community wellbeing: hence the Commission has explored the likely drivers of executive pay and the economic implications of current pay levels and structures. Ultimately, judgment must be exercised, particularly in relation to the magnitude of identified problems and the case for intervention, taking into account both the potential costs and benefits. The Commission's final recommendations constitute an integrated package of reforms that would strengthen board decision-making on executive remuneration, by reducing board 'clubbiness', removing potential for conflicts of interest and enhancing accountability for pay outcomes. Shareholders would get better information and would have more 'say on pay'. executive remuneration, termination benefits, remuneration packages, equity-based payments...|$|E
40|$|This report {{recommends}} that corporate governance should be strengthened through {{the introduction of}} independent remuneration committees, measures to promote board accountability and shareholder engagement, enhanced pay disclosure and increased pressure on those boards that are unresponsive to shareholder concerns. Strong growth in executive remuneration from the 1990 s to 2007, and instances of large payments despite poor company performance, have fuelled community concerns that executive remuneration is out of control. Pay for CEOs of the top 100 companies appears to have grown most strongly, at 13 per cent real a year, from the mid- 90 s to 2000, and then increased by around 6 per cent annually in real terms to 2007. Since 2007 average remuneration has fallen by around 16 per cent a year, returning it to 2004 - 05 levels. Liberalisation of the Australian economy and global competition, increased company size, and the shift to incentive pay structures, have been major drivers of executive remuneration - companies compete to hire the best person for the job, and try to structure pay to maximise the executive 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to company performance. Nonetheless, some past trend and specific pay outcomes appear inconsistent with an efficient executive labour market, and possibly weakened company performance. Incentive pay 2 ̆ 7 imported 2 ̆ 7 from the United States and introduced without appropriate hurdles spurred pay rises in the 1990 s partly for 2 ̆ 7 good luck 2 ̆ 7.

40|$|We study a dynamic-contracting problem {{involving}} {{risk sharing}} between two parties – the Proposer and the Responder – who {{invest in a}} risky asset until an exogenous but random termination time. In any time period they must invest all their wealth in the risky asset, but they can share the underlying investment and termination risk. When the project ends they consume their final accumulated wealth. The Proposer and the Responder have constant relative risk aversion R and r respectively, with R > r > 0. We show that the optimal contract has three components: a non-contingent flow payment, a share in investment risk and a <b>termination</b> <b>payment.</b> We derive approximations for the optimal share in investment risk and the optimal <b>termination</b> <b>payment,</b> and we use numerical simulations to show that these approximations offer a close fit to the exact rules. The approximations {{take the form of}} a myopic benchmark plus a dynamic correction. In the case of the approximation for the optimal share in investment risk, the myopic benchmark is simply the classical formula for optimal risk sharing. This benchmark is endogenous because it depends on the wealths of the two parties. The dynamic correction is driven by counterparty risk. If both parties are fairly risk tolerant, in the sense that 2 > R > r, then the Proposer takes on more risk than she would under the myopic benchmark. If both parties are fairly risk averse, in the sense that R > r > 2, then the Proposer takes on less risk than she would under the myopic benchmark. In the mixed case, in which R > 2 > r, the Proposer takes on more risk when the Responder’s share in total wealth is low and less risk when the Responder’s share in total wealth is high. In the case of the approximation for the optimal <b>termination</b> <b>payment,</b> the myopic benchmark is zero. The dynamic correction tells us, among other things, that: (i) if the asset has a high return then, following termination, the Responder compensates the Proposer for the loss of a valuable investment opportunity; and (ii) if the asset has a low return then, prior to termination, the Responder compensates the Proposer for the low returns obtained. Finally, we exploit our representation of the optimal contract to derive simple and easily interpretable sufficient conditions for the existence of an optimal contract. ...|$|R

50|$|In Canadian National Railway Company v. The Queen, 88 DTC 6340, the {{taxpayer}} received an amount upon {{the termination of}} a contract for the transportation by road and rail of certain supplies and building materials. Justice Strayer of the Federal Court-Trial Division held that the operations under the contract did not constitute a separate business and that they were not that significant that the termination of the contract destroyed {{the taxpayer}}'s “profit-making apparatus” or seriously dislocated its “normal commercial organization”. He went on to hold {{that the purpose of the}} compensation provision in the contract was to enable the taxpayer to “absorb the shock as one of the normal incidents to be looked for” and that the compensation received was “no more than a surrogatum for the future profits surrendered”. As a result, the payment was income. In contrast, in Pe Ben Industries Company Limited v. The Queen, (88 DTC 6347), heard concurrently with Canadian National Railway, a similar payment was held to be capital. In that case, Justice Strayer concluded that the payment was compensation for the destruction of a distinct part of the taxpayer's business. It had been the first “intermodal” undertaking of the taxpayer, which required it to establish a base of operations at a rail yard solely for that purpose. Justice Strayer held that the termination of the contract put an end to the intermodal operations of the taxpayer, such that the payment was capital. He went on to hold that the taxpayer's rights under the contract constituted “property” and that the <b>termination</b> <b>payment</b> constituted “compensation for property destroyed” and therefore proceeds of disposition received in respect of the property.
