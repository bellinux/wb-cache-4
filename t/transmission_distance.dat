25|$|Given its {{conservation}} throughout evolution, {{the action}} potential seems to confer evolutionary advantages. One function of action potentials is rapid, long-range signaling within the organism; the conduction velocity can exceed 110m/s, which is one-third {{the speed of}} sound. For comparison, a hormone molecule carried in the bloodstream moves at roughly 8m/s in large arteries. Part of this function is the tight coordination of mechanical events, such as the contraction of the heart. A second function is the computation associated with its generation. Being an all-or-none signal that does not decay with <b>transmission</b> <b>distance,</b> the action potential has similar advantages to digital electronics. The integration of various dendritic signals at the axon hillock and its thresholding to form a complex train of action potentials is another form of computation, {{one that has been}} exploited biologically to form central pattern generators and mimicked in artificial neural networks.|$|E

40|$|Communication between {{nanoscale}} devices {{is an area}} {{of considerable}} importance as it is essential that future devices be able to form nanonetworks and realise their full potential. Molecular communication is a method based on diffusion, inspired by biological systems and useful over <b>transmission</b> <b>distances</b> in the nm to μm range. The propagation of messenger molecules via diffusion implies that there is thus a probability that they can either arrive outside of their required time slot or ultimately, not arrive at all.

We employ a distributed coding scheme that exploits inherent correlations among sensor data and an adaptive correlation tracking technique based on Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm that provides improved energy efficiency compared to previously pro-posed such joint coding and signal processing schemes for single input single output (SISO) communications based systems. An integration scheme with virtual space-time block coding based M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) communication is also developed. The system efficiency is analyzed for various <b>transmission</b> <b>distances</b> and various channel conditions. Our results show that the proposed system achieves significant energy savings compared to conventional designs beyond certain <b>transmission</b> <b>distances.</b> The achieved energy efficiencies and low decoding error rates justify the application of the proposed scheme in energy constrained wireless sensor networks.
