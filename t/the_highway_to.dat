5|$|As {{initially}} envisioned, the Hanlon Expressway will be {{upgraded to}} a controlled-access highway by removing all existing at-grade intersections and improving <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> <b>to</b> 400-series standards.

The EA for the section south of the Speed River began in early 2007. The Laird Road interchange and associated closing of the Clair Road intersection were the first projects completed as part of this work.|$|E

5|$|By 1967, I-35 {{had been}} {{constructed}} through Oklahoma City. On January 4, 1967, SH-74 was {{split into two}} sections, with {{the removal of the}} section between Goldsby and Norman. The southern section was truncated on December 12, 1974, bringing <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> <b>to</b> its current southern terminus. The gap between the two sections of SH-74 was widened on March 3, 1975, when the route was eliminated through Cleveland County and much of Oklahoma City, bringing SH-74 to its present-day termini.|$|E
5|$|Dating {{back to the}} {{original}} signposting of the state highway system, M-19 initially connected Detroit with Port Huron and Port Austin in 1919. In late 1926, the routing was altered to shorten it to Bad Axe on the north and Richmond on the south. Additional changes in the 1950s and 1960s updated <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> <b>to</b> finish paving the roadway and extend it southward to its present terminus.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{the section}} of M-69 east of Randville was decommissioned, and the {{concurrency}} with M-95 was removed.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, {{construction}} began {{on a new}} arterial highway—known as the North–South Arterial—through downtown Utica. The first portion of <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> <b>to</b> open was the segment between River Road and Trenton Road, which was completed by 1956. It was extended southward to Oriskany Street (NY5A) by 1961 and completed entirely by 1964; however, NY8 was not initially realigned to follow the highway. In the mid-1960s, plans were made to construct a new limited-access highway along the NY8 corridor from Clayville north to New Hartford, where it would connect with the North–South Arterial.|$|E

As part of the project, in January 2007 the Hempfield service plaza was permanently closed.|$|E

Residents {{on the east side of}} the lake voiced similar concerns and the plan was later dropped.|$|E
5|$|The Cann Valley Highway was {{designated}} a state highway on 10 August 1960, and was {{formerly known as}} Cann Valley Road.

It was again renamed as the Monaro Highway on 25 October 1996 to match <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> <b>to</b> which it connects at the NSW border. Within Victoria, VicRoads has classified the Monaro Highway as an arterial road, with the road number 6760.|$|E

The US8/US51 concurrency was altered the next year to a shorter overlap running southward near Heafford Junction. The former routing of US8 was redesignated County Trunk Highway K (CTH-K) after it was transferred back to county control.|$|E

The highway's route {{at that time}} was largely the same as it is today; however, between the Afton area and Welch, US-59 passed through Vinita instead following the modern-day route passing east of it. US-59 was changed to follow the present-day route in 1951. Since then, US-59 has undergone only minor adjustments, many of which eliminated curves and provided a more direct route for travelers using <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> <b>to</b> traverse eastern Oklahoma.|$|E
5|$|US41 {{was first}} {{designated}} as a US Highway in 1926.

US41 replaced the original M-15 designation of the highway which dated back {{to the formation of}} the Michigan state trunkline highway system. M-15 ran from Menominee through Marquette to Houghton and ended in Copper Harbor.
