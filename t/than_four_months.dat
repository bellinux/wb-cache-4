40|$|Parasites {{affect the}} health and {{productivity}} of birds. Haemoproteus columbae occurs in pigeons widely in tropical and subtropical regions. The present investigation was concentrated on the prevalence of H. columbae and rate of parasitemia in domestic pigeons in southwest of Iran. Pigeons regimented in three groups, {{less than six months}} old, between six and twenty <b>four</b> <b>months</b> old and more <b>than</b> twenty <b>four</b> <b>months</b> old. Then stained blood smears were studied for presence of H. columbae and finally rate of parasitemia in every group calculated. Mature and immature stages of H. columbae gametocytes were found in 24 % of blood smears prepared from 100 healthy domestic pigeons. Mean of parasitemia in infected pigeons was 9. 58 %. Mean size of macrogametocytes was 4 μm× 15 μm and mean size of microgametocytes was 3 μm× 12 μm. Mean of parasitemia in infected females was more than males and pipers. Mean of parasitemia in infected old pigeons (pigeons with more <b>than</b> twenty <b>four</b> <b>months</b> old) was more than pigeons with less than six months old and pigeons between six and twenty <b>four</b> <b>months</b> old. This study show the prevalence and rate of parasitemia in domestic pigeons in southwest of Iran. We should be care about this parasite in pigeons by knowing the prevalence and high risk groups...|$|R

5|$|Social {{behaviour}} {{is influenced}} by the climate and geography; as such, the impala are territorial at certain times of the year and gregarious at other times, and the length of these periods can vary broadly among populations. For instance, populations in southern Africa display territorial behaviour only during the few months of the rut, whereas in eastern African populations, territoriality is relatively minimal despite a protracted mating season. Moreover, territorial males often tolerate bachelors, and may even alternate between bachelorhood and territoriality at different times of the year. A study of impala in the Serengeti National Park showed that in 94% of the males, territoriality was observed for less <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>months.</b>|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Therapy {{of chronic}} {{orofacial}} pain (OFP) {{is often a}} challenge since OFP can be triggered by numerous medical conditions. Pulpitis is frequently related to acute OFP, only in rare cases pulpitis elicits chronic OFP e. g. due to a cracked tooth. Hypertrophy of masticatory muscles can also cause pain. While this pathosis is easily diagnosed, hypertrophy of masticatory muscles is challenging to treat. METHODS: The presented case demonstrates {{a combination of a}} cracked tooth and a symtomatic hypertrophy of the masseteric muscle in a 19 -year old patient. The patient suffered from diffuse chronic OFP for more <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>month.</b> After diagnosis an interdisciplinary step-by-step treatment plan was realized with re-evaluation and adjustment. RESULTS: After physiotherapy and medicamentous pain control intramuscular injection of Botolinum toxin type-A was performed with remission of the muscle hypertrophy but only partial success regarding pain control. After root canal treatment of a cracked tooth the patient was free of symptoms. CONCLUSION: The high degree of specialization in dental medicine requires a multidisciplinary approach for OFP not thoroughly responding to therapy. Stepwise diagnostics and treatments are recommended to clarify the pathology and to address multiple causes of disease...|$|R

He played a five-game conditioning stint with the Saint John Flames of the American Hockey League in late October before being recalled by the Flames on October 28, 1999. That night, he made his NHL debut against the Ottawa Senators and was praised by his coach, Brian Sutter, for playing a mistake free game. He scored his first NHL goal on November 10 against the San Jose Sharks. Regehr played 57 games for the Flames in 1999–2000, scoring five goals and 12 points. He was the Flames nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, which recognizes perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. At the age of 19, he was the youngest nominee in NHL history. The Flames also presented him with the Ralph T. Scurfield Humanitarian Award in honour of his perseverance.|$|E
5|$|Like {{some other}} cephalopods, bigfin reef squids {{are capable of}} metachrosis – rapidly {{changing}} body colouration and patterns through voluntary control of chromatophores. They also possess iridophores (particularly in the head), a form of structural colouration that produces iridescent metallic greens and red when illuminated. They are also possibly one of two squid species with leucophores. Leucophores are a reflector-type structural colouration that reflects ambient light, such that they are white in white light, green in green light, and so on. Bigfin reef squids are remarkable for having the ability to produce complex body patterns {{from the moment they}} hatch. In comparison, other loliginid squid species do not produce complex body patterns at less <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> of age. The patterns produced by bigfin reef squids, however, are less diverse than those of the Caribbean reef squids.|$|E
5|$|Porcini {{are sold}} fresh in markets {{in summer and}} autumn in Central and Southern Europe, and dried or canned at other times of the year, and {{distributed}} worldwide to countries where they are not otherwise found. They are eaten and enjoyed raw, sautéed with butter, ground into pasta, in soups, and in many other dishes. In France, they are used in recipes such as cèpes à la Bordelaise, cèpe frits and cèpe aux tomates. Porcini risotto is a traditional Italian autumn dish. Porcini are a feature of many cuisines, including Provençal, and Viennese. They are used in soups and consumed blanched in salads in Thailand. Porcini can also be frozen—either raw or first cooked in butter. The colour, aroma, and taste of frozen porcini deteriorate noticeably if frozen longer <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>months.</b> Blanching or soaking and blanching as a processing step before freezing can extend the freezer life up to 12 months.

It included pre-employment and post-employment support for unemployed lone parents and offered financial incentives for full-time work. The cash value of the Texas incentive was roughly comparable with ERA’s retention bonus, although it was paid monthly rather <b>than</b> every <b>four</b> <b>months.</b> Like ERA, the Texas programme was tested with a random assignment design, and both the programme and control groups received pre-employment services, such as those offered by the New Deal programme.|$|R
