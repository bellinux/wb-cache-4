40|$|Recently, {{wheat gluten}} has been {{proposed}} as <b>technological</b> <b>adjuvant</b> in order to clarify wines. However, the possibility that residual gluten proteins remain in treated wines cannot be excluded, representing a hazard for wheat allergic or celiac disease patients. In this work, commercial wheat glutens, in both partially hydrolyzed (GBS-P 51) and nonhydrolyzed (Gluvital 21000) forms, were used as fining agents in red wine at different concentrations. Beside immunoenzymatic analyses using anti-gliadin, antiprolamin antibodies and pooled sera of wheat allergic patients, a method based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry {{has been proposed}} to detect residues of gluten proteins. Residual gluten proteins were detected by anti-prolamin antibodies, anti-gliadin antibodies and sera-IgE only in the wine treated with GBS-P 51 at concentration 50, 150, and 300 g/hL, respectively, whereas no residual proteins were detected by these systems in the wine treated with Gluvital 21000. In contrast liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses allowed the detection of proteins in red wines fined down to 1 g/hL of Gluvital 21000 and GBS-P 51. Our results indicate that MS methods are superior to immunochemical methods in detecting gluten proteins in wines and that adverse reactions against gluten treated wines cannot be excluded...|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaWith the {{problems}} of the economical crisis there was an increase in the consumption of bread. To increase the supply of convenience bread to be used by the consumer, innovations related to the area of baking become extremely important, making companies more competitive. This study intended to develop a formulation of frozen bread in advanced stages of cooking, left a few minutes in the microwave, it is presented to the consumer as freshly baked. Cooking with microwave technology presents problems that can be overcome with <b>technological</b> <b>adjuvants</b> or enhancers. The enhancer used in the baking test samples was the Fermaid® MW, developed by Lallemand Baking Solutions Boulangerie, DK, in order to provide a good dough stability and good texture of the final product. The Fermaid® MW incorporation and the cooking time period in micro-waves, were determined by the Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The studied samples, were cooked in the micro-wave oven, involved in a semi-discontinued aluminum susceptor, a special packaged with the intention that the cooking could be made from the outside {{to the inside of the}} bread, inducing the browning of the bread crust. After cooking, the samples were cooled for 5 minutes and the hardness of both the crust and the crumb were analyzed by penetration and compression tests and Texture Profile Analysis (TPA), carried out in the texturómeter. The results were not very conclusive, because the variability of the samples was very high and the susceptor applied did not work as intended, but it was clear that the presence of the enhancer decreased the hardness of the breads, however the formulation that was closer to standard values was the formulation of the central point of the experimental design, with concentration of 1. 5 % Fermaid® MW and 6 minute heating in microwave oven, with a mean weight of 68. 9 g...|$|R
40|$|Breast {{cancer has}} the highest {{incidence}} in women. Breast cancer treatment consists of a multimodality approach: surgery, adjuvant systemic treatment, adjuvant radiotherapy. Breast cancer patients have a relative good prognosis which is improving thanks to {{the increasing use of}} (cardiotoxic) systemic therapy and the <b>technological</b> developments. <b>Adjuvant</b> radiotherapy is performed with high-energy ionizing beams. Irradiation of the whole breast has a clear contribution to the good prognosis. However, it might also induce breast fibrosis with inferior cosmetic result in the long-term. Evidence-based data support the additional irradiation ofthe regional lymph nodes for high-risk patients. The disadvantage of radiotherapy is the unavoidable irradiation of the healthy tissue surrounding the target volumes e. g. the heart. Evidence-based data show that therisk of radiation-induced cardiac toxicity will increase in the future. The aim of this dissertation was therefore to investigate how to reducethe heart irradiation without compromising the target coverage. During treatment preparation a model of the patient is created using a CT-scan of the patient. The dose delivered to the target volumes and the organs-at-risk, e. g. the heart, is predicted by a dose calculation algorithm. Due to the complexity of the modeling of the interaction of the ionizing beams with the patient, different dose calculation algorithms exist. The impact of the dose calculation algorithm on the parameters of different radiobiological models was investigated. Those radiobiological models estimate the probability of tumor control or the probability of normaltissue complication. For the most advanced and most accurate dose calculation algorithms, new parameters were derived such that the clinical implementation of the new algorithm does not affect the probability of tumor control and the probability of breast fibrosis. The therapeutic dose is delivered in 16 or 25 daily fractions to enable the repair of sublethal damage in the organs-at-risk e. g. the heart. Therefore, the patient has to be positioned in the same position each day. Setup uncertainties are however unavoidable. To minimize the underdosage of the target volumes, margins are created around the target volume. Those margins definevolumes in which the target volume can move without deteriorating the target coverage. Large volumes ensure correct target coverage but increase the heart dose in left-sided breast radiotherapy. Small margins restrict the heart dose, but might induce target underdosage. Current linear accelerators are equipped with imaging technology enabling pre-treatment patient setup verification. In this dissertation a new and accurate technique for online setup verification was developed. The technique was used to determine the systematic setup error, i. e. the setup error occurring each day, and the random setup error, i. e. the error varying from day to day. Both errors were used to calculate the margins required in breast radiotherapy. Daily application of online setup verification and correction supported reducing those margins. It was shown that this induces areduction of the heart dose which is radiobiologically, i. e. clinically, significant. However, for a subgroup of the left-sided breast cancer patients, the heart dose remains unacceptably high. For those patients deep inspiration breath-hold breast radiotherapy can be applied. Irradiation is then restricted to the deep inspiration phase. Deep inspiration increases the distance between the breast and the heart and hence reduces the heart dose. This technique unavoidably increases the complexity of treatment preparation and treatment delivery. It is therefore of utmost importance to select those patients with clinical benefit {{at the beginning of the}} treatment preparation chain. In this dissertation a methodologyfor patient stratification between free-breathing and deep inspiration breath-hold breast radiotherapy was developed. The methodology has a high specificity. This dissertation proves that the integration of new and existing technologies in the treatment preparation chain reduces the heart dose without compromising the target coverage. The technologies incorporate accurate dose calculation algorithms and accurate setup verification and correction protocols. Individualized treatment modality selection improves workflow efficiency. status: publishe...|$|R
