Table  5 shows the dispersion of numeracy test score results, wages, and years of schooling 16 measured by the coefficient of variation. This data already shows {{that there is no}} clear empirical relationship across countries between wage dispersion and numeracy skill dispersion. <b>Countries</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest dispersions of numeracy test scores are the USA, France, Canada, and the UK, whereas <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lowest dispersions are Japan, the Netherlands, and Finland. In terms of wage inequality, <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest wage dispersion are Japan, the USA, and the UK, and <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lowest wage dispersions are Belgium, Norway, Denmark, and Finland. If there was a strong link between skill dispersion and wage dispersion, the data would be expected to show that <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest skill dispersions exhibit the highest wage dispersion and vice versa; this is not always the case here.
