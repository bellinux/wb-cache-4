5000|$|<b>Assassin</b> : <b>The</b> <b>Assassin</b> class wields daggers {{and light}} armor. Assassins {{generally}} have high dexterity and speed but low strength. The Assassin's special power is Hide in Shadow, which allows <b>the</b> <b>Assassin</b> to become nearly invisible. In this state, <b>the</b> <b>Assassin</b> will be targeted less by enemies. <b>The</b> <b>Assassin</b> also has another unique ability; when <b>the</b> <b>Assassin</b> strikes a foe {{in the back}} with a dagger-type weapon equipped, the damage done will be multiplied by three. Although this is often difficult to implement intentionally in the game, the fact that <b>the</b> <b>Assassin</b> can sneak around with drawing attention means that <b>the</b> <b>Assassin</b> will often be able to inflict strikes to the back without player intervention. When a Make Weapon spell is cast on <b>the</b> <b>Assassin,</b> it wields <b>the</b> Mystic Dagger.|$|R

50|$|Gameplay {{is similar}} to the {{original}} Assassin's Creed. <b>The</b> player's <b>Assassin</b> can perform parkour by running towards climbable walls, hills, or objects, and will automatically perform parkour upon contact. <b>The</b> <b>Assassin</b> can also blend into various people/structures by either pressing the Action button or running into blendable structures/objects, although <b>the</b> <b>Assassin</b> must be in Alerted status or below to blend. Assassinations are performed by tapping the Action button when a nearby guard has the Hidden Blade icon over his head. During combat, players can attack, block attacks, use skills, or exit the fight. However, some skills cannot be used in combat, and exiting fights has a cooldown. <b>The</b> <b>Assassin</b> starts off at the Anonymous status, in which normal guards ignore him. If <b>the</b> <b>Assassin</b> manages to break hostile guards' lines of sight or is doing suspicious acts, <b>the</b> <b>Assassin</b> enters Alerted status, in which normal guards watch <b>the</b> <b>Assassin</b> closely, but do not do anything. During fights or when running from hostile guards, <b>the</b> <b>Assassin</b> is in Wanted status, in which all guards attack <b>the</b> <b>Assassin</b> on sight. Assassins can lower statuses by either breaking hostile guards' lines of sight {{for an extended period of}} time or by blending. However, <b>the</b> <b>Assassin</b> will always be attacked on sight in Restricted Areas, and by some Templar enemies. During combat, the player can also summon hirelings, which depending on class, have a skill and passive upgrade. However, if the player uses the hireling's skill, the hireling can no longer be used for the mission, and passive upgrade is nullified. Players can also use the iconic Eagle Vision and Leap of Faith during missions.|$|R

5|$|Having {{been a fan}} of Kōji Yakusho's acting, Miike made it a {{priority}} that he be cast in the leading role.

50|$|A {{hallmark}} of <b>the</b> <b>Assassin</b> class {{is that they}} have the capability of and excel at acts of stealth. Usually, game mechanics use an Assassin's stealthiness as a form of engagement, allowing <b>the</b> <b>Assassin</b> to engage <b>the</b> target and cause damage before the enemy can realize it. This is often achieved by granting <b>the</b> <b>Assassin</b> abilities that allow them to be invisible or hard to detect and abilities that allow <b>the</b> <b>Assassin</b> to approach <b>the</b> target quickly. Also, the Assassin's stealthiness is used to perform thievery, espionage, or other acts of subterfuge {{in the context of the}} game's storyline.|$|R
