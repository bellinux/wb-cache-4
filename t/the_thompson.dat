5|$|At the {{northeast}} corner of Cross and River Streets stands <b>the</b> <b>Thompson</b> Block, a historic building which was used as barracks in the Civil War. <b>The</b> <b>Thompson</b> Block suffered a bad fire early in the morning on September 23, 2009, and the temporary supports reaching into adjacent streets, installed shortly after the fire to stabilize the structure, blocked westbound traffic on Cross Street for more than three months and have resulted in legal tussles between the city and the property owner.|$|E
5|$|Dayton {{was founded}} on April 1, 1796, by 12 {{settlers}} known as <b>the</b> <b>Thompson</b> Party. They traveled in March from Cincinnati up the Great Miami River by pirogue and landed at what is now St. Clair Street, where they found two small camps of Native Americans. Among <b>the</b> <b>Thompson</b> Party was Benjamin Van Cleve, whose memoirs provide insights into the Ohio Valley's history. Two other groups traveling overland arrived several days later.|$|E

25|$|Gerry Rafferty had booked <b>the</b> <b>Thompsons</b> as <b>the</b> support act for his 1980 tour, and {{had also}} used Richard as a session player on his Night Owl album. Rafferty offered {{to finance the}} {{recording}} of a new Richard and Linda Thompson album which he would then use to secure a contract for <b>the</b> <b>Thompsons.</b> Richard Thompson fell out with Rafferty during this project and was {{not happy with the}} finished product. Nevertheless, Rafferty kept his side of the bargain and presented the album to several record companies – none of which expressed interest in signing <b>the</b> <b>Thompsons.</b> Rafferty did not recover his investment.|$|R

5|$|Tunnels, {{originally}} {{built for}} water drainage, passed beneath the railroad and ran between <b>the</b> <b>Thompson</b> Block and the businesses on Cross Street, and {{were used as}} hiding places by escaped slaves, who hid by day and then rode boats down the Huron River by night. Leonard Chase, a known abolitionist, also operated a station on the Underground Railroad from 1841 to 1860, hiding escaped slaves in his home near the depot. Also during the American Civil War, the Norris Block {{was used as a}} barracks by two regiments: the Fourteenth Michigan Infantry Regiment in early 1862, and the Twenty-Seventh Michigan Infantry Regiment in 1863. Oliver E. Thompson bought the building in 1869, and as it passed down through several generations of <b>the</b> <b>Thompson</b> family, it eventually became known as <b>the</b> <b>Thompson</b> Block.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving office}} as Indian Affairs Superintendent, Palmer worked his farm on his land claim and {{operated}} his sawmill {{and several other}} enterprises. Between 1858 and 1861 he spent time in British Columbia as a merchant to prospectors in the gold rushes of <b>the</b> <b>Thompson</b> River, Similkameen Valley, and Fraser River. Palmer blazed a route to the gold fields of the Okanogan Valley and the upper portions of the Columbia River from Priest Rapids in 1860. In 1862, {{he was elected to}} the Oregon House of Representatives to represent Yamhill County. Now a member of the Republican Party, he was named Speaker of the House during that session.|$|E
5|$|By the 1950s, {{railroad}} traffic declined {{and parts}} of Depot Town began to fall into disrepair. <b>The</b> <b>Thompson</b> Block was put up for sale in 1950, standing vacant {{for more than a}} year. A series of businesses opened and closed in the building, with none finding lasting success. In the late 1960s, landlord David Kircher bought the building, using it as a warehouse. From 1996 until 2005, the building was tied up in legal disputes. Kircher was found guilty of demolition by neglect, and first Barnes and Barnes and then Beal Properties were named receivers. In May 2006, Stewart Beal purchased the building outright.|$|E

25|$|Later {{that same}} year and with <b>the</b> <b>Thompsons</b> still without a contract, Rafferty stepped in and offered to finance and produce a new Richard and Linda Thompson album and then use his {{contacts}} in the industry and the finished album to secure a new contract with <b>the</b> <b>Thompsons.</b> This album was recorded during September and October 1980 at Chipping Norton Recording Studios in Oxfordshire.|$|R
5|$|From {{the time}} Thompson took control until {{shortly after the}} Second World War, the News-Miner lacked a {{dedicated}} connection to the Associated Press. In {{the early years of}} <b>the</b> <b>Thompson</b> administration, he had a dedicated correspondent in Seattle whose job was to read the early editions of the Seattle newspapers, then hurry to the telegraph office and summarize what he had read to Thompson {{on the other end of}} the telegraph cable. This system later was replaced by a dedicated contract with the Alaska Communications System, but that contract limited the News-Miner to no more than 9,000 words per day of messages.|$|E

He has also served as the chair of the Board of Directors of the Poudre Valley Health System Foundation and the Medical Center of the Rockies Foundation, and on the bond oversight committee for <b>the</b> <b>Thompson</b> School District. He is also an avid motorcyclist and regularly participates in the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally and Ride to the Wall, a cross-county ride ending at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.|$|E
5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert found on <b>the</b> <b>Thompson</b> M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was {{exacerbated by the}} presence of dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips {{to move out of the}} line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E

25|$|Finally, in {{the summer}} of 1981 Joe Boyd signed <b>the</b> <b>Thompsons</b> to his small Hannibal label, and in November of that year <b>the</b> <b>Thompsons</b> went back into the studio and {{recorded}} a new album. Boyd's proposal, which <b>the</b> <b>Thompsons</b> accepted, was that the album be recorded {{in a matter of days}} so that money could be put aside for a tour of the USA. The resulting Shoot Out the Lights included fresh recordings of six songs that had been recorded during the Rafferty-sponsored sessions and two newer songs. Linda Thompson was several months pregnant when the album was recorded and so there was no prospect of an immediate release or supporting tour. By the time the album was released Richard and Linda Thompson’s marriage was over.|$|R
25|$|At {{about this}} time <b>the</b> <b>Thompsons</b> and their family {{moved out of the}} commune and back to their old home in Hampstead. Boyd had already invited Richard Thompson to play on Julie Covington's debut album. With spare studio time and the American session musicians hired to work on the Covington album available, <b>the</b> <b>Thompsons</b> went back into the studio to record under their own name {{for the first time in}} three years.|$|R
5|$|By 1840, Tubman's father, Ben, was manumitted {{from slavery}} {{at the age}} of 45, as stipulated in a former owner's will, though his actual age was closer to 55. He {{continued}} working as a timber estimator and foreman for <b>the</b> <b>Thompson</b> family, who had held him as a slave. Several years later, Tubman contacted a white attorney and paid him five dollars to investigate her mother's legal status. The lawyer discovered that a former owner had issued instructions that Rit, like her husband, would be manumitted {{at the age of}} 45. The record showed that a similar provision would apply to Rit's children, and that any children born after she reached 45 years of age were legally free, but the Pattison and Brodess families had ignored this stipulation when they inherited the slaves. Challenging it legally was an impossible task for Tubman.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} first {{appearance}} at the Wimbledon Championships in June 1904, defeating Albert Prebble {{in the first round}} of the singles event before losing to Harold Mahony in four sets. Shortly afterwards, at the Welsh Championships, he reached his first singles final which he lost in straight sets to S.H. Smith. He won his first title in England at the Championships of Shropshire followed by a win at <b>the</b> <b>Thompson</b> Challenge Cup in Redhill; both relatively new and minor events on the tennis circuit. In August 1904 Wilding won the Scottish national championships in Moffat, defeating C.J. Glenny in the final. At his second Wimbledon appearance he came back from two-sets down to defeat William Clothier in the fourth round but lost in the quarterfinal against the experienced Arthur Gore.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) {{designated}} M-149 along {{a gravel}} road in late 1930; the highway provided access from US2 northerly to Palms Book State Park. A second highway, the first creation of M-125, was formed later in 1931 along another gravel road to connect US2 southerly with <b>the</b> <b>Thompson</b> State Fish Hatchery. When US2 was rerouted in the Manistique area in 1936, that highway was moved further south closer to Lake Michigan; M-149 was extended eastward along {{a section of the}} paved highway formerly a part of US2 to connect with M-125 at the Indian Lake State Park. From that point south, M-149 replaced M-125 to Thompson. The former routing of US2 became CR442 except for the section used to extend M-149. In the latter half of 1960 or the beginning of 1961, the MSHD paved the sections of M-149 north and south of the former US2 segment, completely hard-surfacing the roadway for the first time.|$|E
50|$|Listeners keen {{to try to}} find {{connections}} between the albums by <b>the</b> <b>Thompsons</b> and their personal lives may be confused by the delays between writing, recording and release of the early albums. I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight was conceived and recorded prior to the Thompsons' embracing of Islam, but the album's release was substantially delayed. By the time that album was released <b>the</b> <b>Thompsons</b> were living in an Islamic commune in London.|$|R

5|$|After a brief stay in Sydney {{where the}} battalion's {{equipment}} deficiencies were made good and some reinforcements were received from local recruit training depots, they embarked again on 10 January in company with HMAS Canberra, and proceeded through the Bass Strait. As {{they were under}} way, the troops were kept occupied with training on the Bren light machine gun and <b>the</b> <b>Thompson</b> sub-machine gun, quantities of which were hastily added to the battalion's equipment scale. They reached Fremantle, Western Australia, on 15 January and overnight, {{a large number of}} 2/4th men defied orders to stay aboard ship and went ashore to spend time with their families; when the Aquitania sailed the next day, 94 men were left behind. The situation in Malaya was grave as the Japanese were steadily pushing the British and Commonwealth defenders south down the peninsula and as the gravity of the situation dawned upon the Australian government, a knee-jerk reaction saw the dispatch of 150 partially trained reinforcements from Northam. They arrived just as the Aquitania departed, being ferried out to Rottnest Island where they joined the ship's company late in the afternoon of 16 January. Although the reinforcements made good the men that had been left behind, they were only partially trained and ill-prepared for the fighting that would follow.|$|E
5|$|Although the PVA 13th Army had {{a nominal}} {{strength}} of 230,000 men, its actual strength {{during the battle}} could be as low as 150,000 men. The PVA 66th Corps, for example, had only 6,600 men per division {{at the start of}} the battle, as opposed to the expected 10,000 men per division. There were also only one firearm available for every three Chinese soldiers, and the rest were employed as grenade throwers. Because most of the Chinese howitzers and guns were left behind in Manchuria, mortars were the only artillery support available for the Chinese. For the counteroffensive, the average Chinese soldier were issued with only five days worth of rations and ammunition, and resupply could only be obtained by scavenging on the battlefield. To compensate for its shortcomings, the Chinese relied extensively on night attacks and infiltrations in order to avoid the UN firepower. The primitive logistics system had also allowed the Chinese to maneuver over the rough hilly terrains, thus enabled them to by-pass the UN defenses and to surround the isolated UN positions. Because the Chinese had captured large numbers of Nationalist weapons during the Chinese Civil War, most of the Chinese weapons were composed of US made small arms such as <b>the</b> <b>Thompson</b> submachine gun, the M1 Garand rifle, the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, the bazooka and the M2 mortar.|$|E

25|$|The Army {{introduced}} the U.S. M3 and M3A1 submachine guns in 1943 {{with plans to}} produce the latter in numbers sufficient to cancel future orders for <b>the</b> <b>Thompson,</b> while gradually withdrawing it from the first-line service. However, due to unforeseen production delays and requests for modifications, the M3/M3A1 never replaced <b>the</b> <b>Thompson,</b> and purchases continued until February 1944.
