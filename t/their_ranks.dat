5|$|Jacques I {{assumed the}} name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French {{aristocracy}} showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from <b>their</b> <b>ranks</b> and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco.

5|$|FRELIMO attack {{groups had}} {{also begun to}} grow in size to include over 100 {{soldiers}} in certain cases, and the insurgents also began to accept women fighters into <b>their</b> <b>ranks.</b> On either October 10 or October 11, 1966, on returning to Tanzania after inspecting the front lines, Filipe Samuel Magaia was shot dead by Lourenço Matola, a fellow FRELIMO guerrilla who {{was said to be}} in the employ of the Portuguese.|$|E

The new junta decided to ignore Khiêm’s actions and he remained in Washington as the ambassador, with no further action taken. Phát and Thảo stayed in hiding in Catholic villages. They offered to surrender and support the government if they and their officers were granted amnesty.|$|E
5|$|The 610 Office's {{intelligence}} collection efforts are bolstered through he cultivation of paid civilian informants. 610 Offices at local levels {{have been found}} to offer substantial monetary rewards for information leading to the capture of Falun Gong practitioners, and 24-hour hotlines have been created for civilians to report on Falun Gong-related activity. In some locales, 'responsibility measures' are enacted whereby workplaces, schools, neighborhood committees and families are held accountable for monitoring and reporting on Falun Gong practitioners within <b>their</b> <b>ranks.</b>|$|E

5|$|These escaped {{slaves were}} able to defeat a small force of troops sent after them from Capua, and equip {{themselves}} with captured military equipment {{as well as their}} gladiatorial weapons. Sources are somewhat contradictory on the order of events immediately following the escape, but they generally agree that this band of escaped gladiators plundered the region surrounding Capua, recruited many other slaves into <b>their</b> <b>ranks,</b> and eventually retired to a more defensible position on Mount Vesuvius.|$|E
5|$|Thảo and Phát were {{stripped}} of <b>their</b> <b>ranks,</b> {{but nothing was}} initially done as far as prosecuting or sentencing them for their involvement in the coup for the time being.

5|$|When {{faced with}} opponents who used {{unfamiliar}} fighting techniques, {{such as in}} Central Asia and India, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style. Thus, in Bactria and Sogdiana, Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while massing his cavalry at the center. In India, confronted by Porus' elephant corps, the Macedonians opened <b>their</b> <b>ranks</b> to envelop the elephants and used their sarissas to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants' handlers.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus is {{the seat}} of Aarhus Municipality and Aarhus City Council (Aarhus Byråd) is also the {{municipal}} government. The Mayor of Aarhus until 2017 is Jacob Bundsgaard of the Social Democrats. Municipal elections are held every fourth year on the third Tuesday of November. The city council consists of 31 members elected for four-year terms. When an election has determined {{the composition of the}} council, it elects a mayor, two deputy mayors and five aldermen from <b>their</b> <b>ranks.</b> Anyone who is eligible to vote and who resides within the municipality can run for a seat on the city council provided they can secure endorsements and signatures from 50 inhabitants of the municipality.|$|E
5|$|After the Lancastrians {{had ceased}} loosing their arrows, Fauconberg ordered his archers {{to step forward}} again to shoot. When they had {{exhausted}} their ammunition, the Yorkists plucked arrows off {{the ground in front}} of them—arrows loosed by their foes—and continued loosing. Coming under attack without any effective response of its own, the Lancastrian army moved from its position to engage the Yorkists in close combat. Seeing the advancing mass of men, the Yorkist archers shot a few more volleys before retreating behind <b>their</b> <b>ranks</b> of men-at-arms, leaving thousands of arrows in the ground to hinder the Lancastrian attack.|$|E

5|$|Following the Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Popovac joined the Chetnik movement of Draža Mihailović. Popovac was {{a proponent of}} Bosnian Muslim cooperation with the Chetniks and suggested that they recruit Muslims into <b>their</b> <b>ranks.</b> In October 1942, he enlisted Italian aid in fighting the communist Partisans, and later visited Prozor to discourage further bloodshed after a Chetnik massacre that took the lives {{of as many as}} 2,500 Muslim and Croat civilians. In early 1943, he led an attack against a Muslim village. Later that year, he was killed in disputed circumstances near the town of Trebinje.|$|E
5|$|Following the duels, general {{engagement}} {{between the}} two armies commenced. Meccan confidence quickly began to dissolve as the Muslims swept through <b>their</b> <b>ranks.</b> The Meccan army was pushed back, and repeated attempts by its cavalry to overrun the left Muslim flank were negated by the Muslim archers. Enjoying {{the best of these}} early encounters, the Muslims pierced through the Meccan lines, with victory appearing certain. However, it was the detachment of the Muslim archers, disobeying Muhammad's strict orders to remain stationary, that would shift the outcome of the battle, as they ran downhill to join in the advance and despoil the Meccan camp, leaving the flank vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|In 1826, an {{assembly}} elected Bernardino Rivadavia {{as president of}} the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. This action roused the ire of the provinces, and civil war was the result. Support for a strong, centralized Argentine government was based in Buenos Aires, and gave rise to two opposing groups. The wealthy and educated of the Unitarian Party, such as Sarmiento, favored centralized government. In opposition to them were the Federalists, who were mainly based in rural areas and tended to reject European mores. Numbering figures such as Manuel Dorrego and Juan Facundo Quiroga among <b>their</b> <b>ranks,</b> they were in favor of a loose federation with more autonomy for the individual provinces.|$|E

5|$|In the 2002 Nunavut Tourism {{publication}} The Time is Right: A Vision and Strategy for Tourism Development in Nunavut, {{a number}} of issues facing Nunavut tourism operators were highlighted. One major issue for the Nunavut tourism industry is the territory's remote nature. This imposes high travel costs on visitors to Nunavut, and drives tourism numbers down. In addition, Nunavut's position north of the Arctic Circle reduces the opportunity for spring activities, and results in a highly seasonally based tourism market. This limits opportunities for year-round employment in the territory. Many tourism organisations and operators faced difficulty attracting high-quality staff members to <b>their</b> <b>ranks,</b> and experienced high levels of turnover. There are limited links between tourism operators, inhibiting opportunities for inter-sector growth.|$|E
5|$|Minton's time on {{the court}} {{marked the end of}} a {{transitory}} period in the judiciary. Since Minton, justices have tended to serve increasingly longer terms on the court, which has had strong political science implications on the Supreme Court. The growing concept of judicial non-partisanship became the norm in American politics after Minton—he was the last member of Congress of be appointed to the court.
