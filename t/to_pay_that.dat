25|$|For the Austrians, {{cost was}} a result of demand, as this would {{determine}} the level of production, depending on the willingness of buyers <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>that</b> cost. Since demand is dependent upon the action of buyers, utility would determine a thing's cost rather than technology. In this context, the Austrian concept of opportunity cost claimed to ruin the British parametric concept of cost. The opportunity cost would be that which the purchaser would willingly forgo in agreeing to pay the cost of the option chosen.|$|E
25|$|There {{is nothing}} to prevent a debtor from having his estate sequestrated by an amicable creditor. The debtor may, for instance, arrange with a friend to whom he owes a debt, and whom he is unable <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> <b>that</b> he (the debtor) will commit an act of insolvency. (He will, for instance, write a letter saying that he cannot meet the debt.) The friend will then apply for {{compulsory}} sequestration {{on the strength of}} this act of insolvency. An application for compulsory sequestration brought by a creditor who is not at arm’s length is generally referred to as “friendly” sequestration.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason why}} {{individuals}} see debits and credits {{in the above}} manner, is that the bank statement presented by the bank to the customer is the bank's view of the account. The bank views money in a chequing account as money the bank owes to the customer, i.e. a liability, and in the rules of accounting, an increase to a liability account is a credit. Likewise, when a bank lends money to a customer and places the money into the customer's chequing account, the bank has increased its obligation <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>that</b> money, which is a liability, and this increase is a credit and appears in the credit column of a bank statement.|$|E

500|$|... "Lucky Star" [...] was {{initially}} {{decided to be}} released as the third single from the album, but [...] "Holiday" [...] had already become a dance-hit in the United States. Hence it was released as the fourth single from the album. Music executive Jeff Ayeroff, who was instrumental in green-lighting Madonna's career, recalled how Madonna initially didn't want to release [...] "Lucky Star" [...] as a single. He says that around that time Madonna was getting sued and needed money, so he told her [...] "Let me release 'Lucky Star', and I guarantee that you'll sell enough records <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>that</b> off." [...] According to Ayeroff, he was right because [...] "'Lucky Star' broke the first album wide open." ...|$|E
500|$|Popular was {{uncertain}} {{of the sales}} potential for the two new titles and decided to publish them under its Fictioneers imprint, which was used for lower-paying magazines. Astonishings first issue was dated February 1940; it was bimonthly, alternating monthly with Super Science Stories. [...] Pohl's budget for an issue was $405: in Pohl's memoirs he recalls Harry Steeger, {{one of the company}} owners, breaking down the budget for him: [...] "Two hundred seventy-five dollars for stories. [...] A hundred dollars for black and white art. Thirty dollars for a cover." [...] Pohl could only offer half a cent per word for fiction, well below the rates offered by the leading magazines. [...] At ten cents, the magazine was cheaper {{than any of the other}} sf magazines of the day, and it sold well, despite Pohl's limited resources. [...] It was certainly assisted by Popular's wide and effective distribution network, and the publisher soon increased Pohl's budget, to pay bonuses for popular stories. [...] Pohl later commented that he {{was uncertain}} whether the additional funds really helped to bring in higher quality submissions, although at the time he assured Steeger it would improve the magazine. [...] Some of the additional money went to long-time writer Ray Cummings, who was sufficiently well known that the young Pohl felt unable to reject his stories, even though he disliked his work. [...] Cummings came to see Pohl in person to submit his work, and refused to sell for less than one cent a word; since the first visit came on a day when Pohl had some extra money available, Pohl was never able to bring himself to tell Cummings that he could not really afford <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>that</b> rate. [...] Pohl comments in his memoirs that [...] "for months he would turn up regularly as clockwork and sell me a new story; I hated them all, and bought them all." ...|$|E

2500|$|Once {{discussions with}} the family are {{complete}} and satisfactory information about the woman is acquired then {{the family of the}} man will proceed to appoint marriage negotiators. It is these very negotiators that will travel to the family of the woman to make known the man and his intentions. Once the negotiators reach the family of the woman they will be kept in the kraal, inkundla, of the woman's family. If the family do not possess a kraal they will simply be kept outside the household as they {{will not be allowed to}} enter the household without the acknowledgement and acceptance of the woman's family. It is here where the lobola (dowry) negotiations will begin. The family of the woman will give them a bride-price and a date for which they must return <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>that</b> price. The bride-price is dependent on numerous things such as her level of education, the wealth status of her family in comparison to that of the man's family, what the man stands to gain in the marriage and the overall desirability of the woman. The payment of the bride-price could be in either cattle or money depending on the family of the woman. The modern Xhosa families would rather prefer money as most are situated in the urban cities where there would be no space nor permits for livestock.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2010, Ahern {{has said}} he would have no {{difficulties}} giving evidence to the investigation into banking, nor having his testimony heard in public. Saying he would appear if asked, Ahern defended his record while in government, attributing the crisis in banking to international factors and the banks’ over-exposure to borrowing on international markets. [...] "By and large we all know what happened. The banks borrowed money on the open market in the short-term. And as soon as things went, they had <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>that</b> money up but they hadn’t got it to pay," [...] he said. [...] "That's what happened. I don’t think it will take too long [...] to write up what the position is." [...] He continued saying, [...] "The greater issue was the protection and the regulation of the bank rather than consumers’ interests." [...] Mr Ahern also said that people were [...] "jumping over developers" [...] but also needed to remember they employed 200,000 people. He said that {{one of the first things}} that Brian Cowen had done when he became minister for finance was to abolish many of the property tax incentives. He also stood over many of the incentives that benefited property developers. [...] "When they were brought in, the place was in a disastrous way. Look at the quays in Dublin. There were reports around for 40 years that said the quays needed something done about them and nothing happened until we brought in the urban renewal status and gave the tax incentives." ...|$|E
