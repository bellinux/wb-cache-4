40|$|Participating a {{scientific}} workshop is nowadays often an adventure {{because the number}} of participants do seldom exceed the number of talks. A half-day workshop is mostly finished at lunchtime, speakers are sometimes not present and unexcused, and a strict progression of the workshop offers little air for discussion.

However, it was the discussion about some of the invisible influences on our work that really aroused my curiosity. In particular, the thought-provoking workshop by Robyn Cockburn on Systems Theory inspired some critical ‘thinking about recreation’. In his review of the symposium published in the 06 Spring Issue of Australasian Parks and Leisure, Geoff Canham said that this (i. e. Systems Theory) session “drew the most feedback and stimulated much discussion long after it ended”. It was evident many delegates had a desire to look beyond the pragmatics of recreation although this can pose challenges of the intellectual kind.

40|$|By {{cultural}} manipulation we will mean, {{in a broad}} sense, {{everything a}} farmer might do to increase crop yields per hectare, after he decides what to plant and buys the seed. With this restriction we leave out the agricultural economist and the plant breeder. When we limit our interest to yields per hectare we introduce an element of area. This will include the crop canopy above the surface and the root system below it. Cultural manipulation also includes what the farmer might do to make best use of water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and essential mineral nutrients whether they occur naturally or otherwise. We will also include manipulations designed {{to make the most}} efficient use of radiant energy during the growing season. Finally, consideration of the length of the growing season introduces the concept of time as one of the objects of cultural manipulation. This is a vast subject from which we cannot hope to do more than select a few interesting points to discuss. To review the literature we would have to start with the most ancient findings of archaeology when cultural practices were more the concern of priests than of agronomists. Last year a third to a half of the papers published in the area of agronomy would come within our definition so there is still some interest in the subject.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Even if shortly, {{this article}} {{deals with a}} {{question}} that is still largely unexplored by jurisprudence and doctrine, about the professional liability of clinicians for off-label prescriptions; that’s to say the prescription of approved drugs for therapeutic indications and employments different from those they had been approved for. This work analyzes the main rules that regulate off-label prescriptions and some important elements correlated with the clinician’s professional liability, such as guilt, damages and causality connection. DISCUSSION The regulations in force say that the clinician’s prescription is fully legal only if the drug has been previously approved in the medicine data sheet for the same way of administration, dosage or therapeutic indications it has been actually prescribed to the patient (art. 3, 1 st paragraph, L. 98 / 1998). Next to this general principle, the same law provides for some exceptions and provides for some exceptions to this general principle, giving the doctor {{the possibility of using}} an off-label drug for a therapeutic purpose different from that it had been registered, under his own responsibility and according to published scientific documents, after having informed the patient who must give his consent. It’s clear that, since we are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is borderline between treatment and clinical experimentation, the doctrine considers dangerous this practice (art. 2050 c. c.). In this perspective (dangerous practice), in the event of damage to the patient, the doctor will have to prove he had taken all the right precautionary measures to avoid it, according to such a high level of diligence proportioned to the risk for the patient an off-label prescription can follow. Obviously, the more distant is the best practice from the therapy prescribed by the doctor, even if including treatments with off-labels, the heavier should be considered the professional guilt in the presence of damage for the patient. CONCLUSIONS in wiew of the considerable diffusion of off-label prescriptions, it seem to be necessary to regulate this custom, according to {{the context in which the}} prescription occurs. This also by reason of the fact that, in the “more innovating spheres”, off-label prescriptions can be often an important opportunity that can bring about significant improvements, without forgetting that the use of off-labels exposes the patient to possible risks which must be considered by the doctor before prescribing...|$|E

5000|$|Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin (1981) {{established}} {{that there is}} a need of creating meanings in a dialogic way with other people.

The concept of dialogue, itself, establishes the existence of the [...] "other" [...] person. In fact, it is through dialogue that the [...] "other" [...] cannot be silenced or excluded. Bakhtin states that meanings are created in processes of reflection between people. And these are the same meanings that we use in later conversations with others, where those meanings get amplified and even change as we acquire new meanings. In this sense, Bakhtin states that every time <b>that</b> we <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> we have read about, seen or felt; we are actually reflecting the dialogues we have had with others, showing the meanings that we have created in previous dialogues. This is, what is said cannot be separated from the perspectives of others: the individual speech and the collective one are deeply related. It is in this sense that Bakhtin <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> chain of dialogues, to point that every dialogue results from a previous one and, at the same time, every new dialogue is going to be present in future ones.|$|R
