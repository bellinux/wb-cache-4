500|$|The play {{opened for}} tryouts in New Haven, Connecticut on March 22, 1945. [...] The first act was well-received; {{the second act}} was not. [...] Casto {{recalled}} that the second act finished about 1:30a.m. [...] The staff immediately sat down for a two-hour conference. [...] Five scenes, half the ballet, and two songs were cut from the show as the result. [...] John Fearnley commented, [...] "Now I see why these people have hits. [...] I never witnessed anything so brisk and brave in my life." [...] De Mille said of this conference, [...] "not three minutes had been wasted pleading for something cherished. [...] Nor was there any idle joking.... We cut and cut and cut and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed." [...] By the time the company left New Haven, de Mille's ballet was down to forty minutes.|$|E
2500|$|In Hans Christian Andersen's {{fairy tale}} The Elder-Tree Mother, an old married couple remembers how {{they used to}} go to the Round Tower, [...] "and looked down on Copenhagen, and far, far away over the water; <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Frederiksberg , where the King and the Queen were sailing about in their splendid barges!'.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, sir, Martin and I {{thought it}} {{our duty to}} see this war out. When Leyden is safe from the Spaniards, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> England, not before." ...|$|R
60|$|After Mr. Crawley {{had done}} haranguing and expounding, we {{received}} our candles, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed; and then I was disturbed in my writing, as I have described to my dearest sweetest Amelia.|$|E
60|$|I {{promised him}} not to run away immediately, a promise which was not hard to make; <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> inspect my horse, which {{proved to be a}} very fine bay, saddled with a dashing native recado.|$|E
60|$|I put {{the courier}} {{in the care}} of a gentleman who was going to Lausanne, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed, after laying out the walking-costumes and putting them into {{condition}} for instant occupation in the morning.|$|E
50|$|<b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a new world. A {{world where}} the Dark Hunters live. The Shadowed One is making plans <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> Metru Nui because {{of the death of}} Nidhiki and Krekka. He leaves Lariska in charge of the island.|$|R

5000|$|If the {{alternation}} theorem is not satisfied, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> (2) and iterate {{until the}} alternation theorem is satisfied.|$|R
60|$|We walked {{about the}} garden smoking, but saying nothing--because we were friends, and talking spoils good tobacco--till our pipes were out. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> wake up Fleete. He was wide awake and fidgeting about his room.|$|E
60|$|I {{paid for}} what we had drunk, and {{we made our way}} to a cheap restaurant, crowded and gay, where we dined with pleasure. I had the {{appetite}} of youth and he of a hardened conscience. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> a tavern to have coffee and liqueurs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I said it. And <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Moseley's, two miles, {{and all of}} {{them were}} gone to the camp meeting over on Stony Fork; and then we came all the way back, two miles, and then here, another mile--and Providence has provided. You see it yourselves." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> back <b>to</b> the house, where, of course, {{we looked}} at some wood work, agates, and all the et cetera.|$|R
5000|$|Korine {{worked with}} editor Chris Tellefsen to {{synthesize}} the pre-planned footage with the [...] "mistakist" [...] footage. Korine comments, [...] "We go from scenes that are completely thought out, almost formal, scenes that resonate in this classical film sense, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> other scenes where it's like, total mistakes, stuff shot on video {{where the kids}} forget there's a camera there {{and talk about how}} much they hate niggers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Beric said, [...] "there is {{one more}} struggle, and a stout one, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> join our friends who have gone before us in the Happy Island in the far west. We need not be ashamed to meet them. They will welcome us as men who have {{struggled}} to the last for liberty against the oppressor, and who have nobly upheld the honour of the Iceni. We shall meet with a great welcome." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed. Next {{morning we}} breakfasted rather late, since when one {{has nothing to}} do there is no object in getting up early. As I was {{preparing}} to go to the cook-house to boil some eggs, to our astonishment Hans appeared with a kettle of coffee.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thereafter," [...] resumed Guttorm, [...] "we {{sailed to}} England, and ravaged {{far and wide}} in the land. We sailed all the way north to Northumberland, where we plundered, and thence to Scotland, where we marauded far and wide. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the Hebrides and fought some battles, and after that south to Man, which we herried. We ravaged far around in Ireland, and steered thence to Bretland, which we laid waste with fire and sword--also the {{district}} of Cumberland. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Valland, [the west coast of France] from which we fared away for the south coast of England, but missed it and made the Scilly Isles. After that we went to Ireland again, {{and came to a}} harbour, into which we ran--but in a friendly way, for we had as much plunder as our ships could carry.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Poplington {{first took}} us to the old Watergate, which was the river {{entrance}} to York House, where Lord Bacon lived, and close to the gate was the small house where Peter the Great and David Copperfield lived, though not at the same time; and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Will's old coffee-house, where Addison, Steele, {{and a lot of other}} people of that sort used to go to drink and smoke before they was buried in Westminster Abbey, and where Charles and Mary Lamb lived afterward, and where Mary used to look out of the window to see the constables take the thieves to the Old Bailey near by. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Tom-all-alone's, and saw the very grating at the head of the steps which led to the old graveyard where poor Joe used to sweep the steps when Lady Dedlock came there, and I held on to the very bars that the poor lady must have gripped when she knelt on the steps to die.|$|E
60|$|And <b>then</b> <b>we</b> all <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed, and I {{dreamed that}} I had married Maiwa, and was much {{afraid of that}} {{attractive}} but determined lady.|$|R
60|$|Bill Foster said he'd make 'im laugh {{the other}} side of his face if he wasn't careful, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> off <b>to</b> sleep agin and forgot all about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Make your camels {{lie down}} in this open space," [...] he said, [...] "so that we can easily load them; <b>then</b> <b>we</b> will <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the treasure." ...|$|R
60|$|After we had {{explored}} the church {{we went out}} to walk about the place. We crossed the beautiful bridge over the Avon, and thought how lovely those fields and meadows would look, if they only had sunshine to set them out. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the town hall, where we met the mayor, who had kindly called and offered to show us the place.|$|E
6000|$|... “No, {{we went to}} Washington {{first and}} there we pawned one diamond for sixty dollars. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Jacksonville. There we met Luke Watson, and both of us got scared to death. We had paid for our passage on the Emma Brower, and we kept out of sight till the bark sailed. After the storm we landed here with those four sailors, and were waiting to sight some passing ship when you and your crowd turned up.” ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Ischia, but I {{had already}} been to that island and tired myself to death [...] "resting" [...] {{a couple of days}} and {{studying}} human villainy, with the landlord of the Grande Sentinelle for a model. So we went to Procida, and from thence to Pozzuoli, where St. Paul landed after he sailed from Samos. I landed at precisely the same spot where St. Paul landed, and so did Dan and the others. It was a remarkable coincidence. St. Paul preached to these people seven days before he started to Rome.|$|E
5000|$|... {{which means}} that if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> from state A to state B <b>then</b> <b>we</b> will <b>go</b> <b>to</b> state A1. After {{parameterizing}} such a rule with a lookahead we have: ...|$|R

60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> on <b>to</b> Moggs {{and found}} him in a camel-hair dressing-jacket in a luxurious bed, {{drinking}} China tea, and got the shape of everything but the figures fixed by lunch time.|$|R
60|$|Joe {{made the}} fire and swept the hearth, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the door to listen for the chaise-cart. It was a dry cold night, and the wind blew keenly, and the frost was white and hard. A man would die to-night of lying out on the marshes, I thought. And then I looked at the stars, and {{considered}} how awful {{it would be for}} a man to turn his face up to them as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{pay a visit}} at a {{hotel in}} Jermyn Street to our friend Florac who was now magnificently lodged there. A {{powdered}} giant lolling in the hall, his buttons emblazoned with prodigious coronets, took our cards up to the Prince. As the door of an apartment on the first floor opened, we heard a cry as of joy; and that nobleman in a magnificent Persian dressing-gown, rushing from the room, plunged down the stairs, and began kissing Clive, to the respectful astonishment of the Titan in livery.|$|E
6000|$|So <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the post-office to get [...] "Sid"; {{but just}} as I suspicioned, he warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out of the office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn't come; so the old man said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done fooling around--but we would ride. I couldn't get him to let me stay and wait for Sid; and he said there warn't no use in it, and I must come along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} zero {{temperature}} Casimir energy and fermion number for Dirac fields in a 2 + 1 -dimensional Minkowski space-time, {{in the presence}} of a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the spatial manifold. <b>Then,</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the finite-temperature problem with a chemical potential, introduced as a uniform zero component of the gauge potential. By performing a Lorentz boost, we obtain Hall's conductivity in the case of crossed electric and magnetic fields.
