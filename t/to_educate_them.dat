Marie strongly disapproved of her son's actions and felt hurt by Doletti's repeated attempts to keep Nicholas from communicating with his mother. Although she blamed {{the women in}} her sons' lives for a while, she also came to blame herself, for failing <b>to</b> <b>educate</b> <b>them</b> properly. However, she stubbornly and continually refused to meet Magda Lupescu, even after Carol's pleas. Until her last years, Marie seldom even mentioned Lupescu's name.|$|E

25|$|Christians {{regarded}} the emperor {{as a mere}} man who was as much under God's authority as were his subjects, and Christian values favored the social emancipation of women and children. The church permitted the remarriage of widows (as taught by the apostle Paul, not traditionally allowed in East Asian societies), prohibited concubinage and polygamy, and forbade cruelty to or desertion of wives. Christian parents were taught to regard their children as gifts from God, and were required <b>to</b> <b>educate</b> <b>them.</b> Arranged child marriages and the neglect of daughters (who were often regarded as less desirable than sons in Asian culture) were prohibited.|$|E

25|$|Recorded missionary {{efforts in}} Denmark started with Willibrord, Apostle to the Frisians, who preached in Schleswig, {{which at the}} time was part of Denmark. He went north from Frisia {{sometime}} between 710 and 718 during the reign of King Ongendus. Willibrord and his companions had little success: the king was respectful but had no interest in changing his beliefs. Agantyr did permit 30 young men to return to Frisia with Willibrord. Perhaps Willibrord's intent was <b>to</b> <b>educate</b> <b>them</b> and recruit some of them to join his efforts to bring Christianity to the Danes. A century later Ebbo, Archbishop of Reims and Willerich, later Bishop of Bremen, baptized a few persons during their 823 visit to Denmark. He returned to Denmark twice to proselytize but without any recorded success.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, {{however, the}} Dutch colonial policy towards the East Indies changed and {{moved from the}} liberalist to neoliberalist {{point of view of}} how to deal with {{imperial}} possessions. The trend showed the desire to guard the rights of the natives and implement a better protection of colonies against outside threat. With this idea, the Netherlands began a program of greater integration in the Dutch East Indies. It was based primarily on the humanitarian idea of offering help and guidance to achieve peace and order. This was due to the assumption that subjects of the empire were not mature enough to build their own state or politics, and the mother country felt the obligation <b>to</b> <b>educate</b> <b>them</b> in the sphere and set an example. The new policy was called Assimilation and aimed to create a unity between Eastern and Western Dutchmen. The new harmony would be joined politically and nationally disregarding racial differences which could not weaken it. This however would mean the granting of political autonomy to the dependent Indonesia, something {{that a large number of}} Dutchmen did not agree with primarily because of economic reasons. This cultural and national synthesis was never realized in as much as strong nationalistic feelings in the Dutch East Indies, and European affairs soon ripped the plan apart.|$|E

500|$|The {{stereotyping}} of Native Americans must {{be understood}} {{in the context of}} history which includes conquest, forced relocation, and organized efforts to eradicate native cultures, such as the boarding schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which separated young Native Americans from their families in order <b>to</b> <b>educate</b> <b>them</b> as European Americans. As stated in an editorial by Carter Meland (Anishinaabe heritage) and David E. Wilkins (Lumbee) both professors of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota: [...] "Since the first Europeans made landfall in North America, native peoples have suffered under a weltering array of stereotypes, misconceptions and caricatures. Whether portrayed as noble savages, ignoble savages, teary-eyed environmentalists or, most recently, simply as casino-rich, native peoples find their efforts to be treated with a measure of respect and integrity undermined by images that flatten complex tribal, historical and personal experience into one-dimensional representations that tells us more about the depicters than about the depicted." ...|$|E

500|$|Stating in her preface that [...] "my main {{argument}} {{is built on}} this simple principle, that if [...] be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all", Wollstonecraft contends that society will degenerate without educated women, particularly because mothers are the primary educators of young children. She attributes the problem of uneducated women to men and [...] "a false system of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men who [...] females rather as women than human creatures". Women are capable of rationality; it only appears that they are not, because men have refused <b>to</b> <b>educate</b> <b>them</b> and encouraged them to be frivolous (Wollstonecraft describes silly women as [...] "spaniels" [...] and [...] "toys"). While stressing it is of the same kind, she entertains the notion that women {{might not be able}} to attain the same degree of knowledge that men do.|$|E
500|$|There {{were two}} {{schools of thought}} on whether Sanskrit should be taught {{for the purpose of}} {{assisting}} the administration and conversion of India, or for its own merits. The East India Company had provided instruction in Sanskrit to its employees at its college at Haileybury, Hertfordshire, and the College of Fort William in Calcutta, <b>to</b> <b>educate</b> <b>them</b> in local culture. For some, this led to an interest in Indian religion and culture as revealed in the Sanskrit texts. This was in contrast to the situation in continental Europe, where scholars examined Sanskrit as part of the [...] "science of language", comparative philology, rather than for reasons of imperial administration. Fewer European scholars visited India, but many British Sanskritists had lived and worked there. Some British scholars in other fields had strong doubts in any event about Sanskrit, as a [...] "crude linguistic forgery pieced out of Latin and Greek", or as proving little [...] "except a thoroughly unwelcome kinship between Briton and Brahmin", {{in the words of the}} American academic Linda Dowling.|$|E
500|$|Jarrow's {{script was}} [...] "almost entirely based on Hubbard's own {{writings}} and the church's literature", though Jarrow was {{also influenced by}} critical journalistic accounts.

[...] Timbers said they chose to stick to Church of Scientology primary source material for background on the script because [...] "We thought {{that the best way}} to satirize the Church of Scientology was to let the Church speak for itself." [...] During production, the creative team worked with cast members <b>to</b> <b>educate</b> <b>them</b> about the play's background. [...] "Kids shouldn't just be saying things that they don't understand. That's what we're criticizing...people who just parrot behavior and language. We wanted to have an honest conversation with them," [...] Jarrow said. [...] The published version of the script says that the musical should not be performed by adults; Jarrow said adults are [...] "too jaded", and would not be able to portray the [...] "unwinking satire" [...] of the piece.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{significant}} effect on the people in South America was the spread of Christianity.

[...] With the depopulation of the local populations along with the capitulation of the Inca Empire, the Spanish missionary work after colonization began was able to continue unimpeded.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{entrepreneurship}} {{has struggled with}} fundamental questions concerning the subject’s nature and purpose. To whom and to what means are educational and training agendas ultimately directed? Such questions have become of central importance to policy makers, practitioners and academics alike. There are suggestions that university business schools should engage more critically with the lived experiences of practising entrepreneurs through alternative pedagogical approaches and methods, seeking to account for and highlighting the social, political and moral aspects of entrepreneurial practice. In the UK, where funding in higher education has become increasingly dependent on student fees, there are renewed pressures <b>to</b> <b>educate</b> students for entrepreneurial practice as opposed <b>to</b> <b>educating</b> <b>them</b> {{about the nature and}} effects of entrepreneurship. Government and EU policies are calling on business schools to develop and enhance entrepreneurial growth and skill sets, to make their education and training programmes more proactive in providing innovative educational practices which help and facilitate life experiences and experiential learning. This paper makes the case for critical frameworks to be applied so that complex social processes become a source of learning for educators and entrepreneurs and so that innovative pedagogical approaches can be developed in terms both of context (curriculum design) and process (delivery methods) ...|$|R

500|$|Before Kościuszko {{left for}} France, he {{collected}} his back pay, wrote a will, and entrusted it to Jefferson as executor. Kościuszko and Jefferson had become firm friends by 1797 and thereafter corresponded {{for twenty years}} {{in a spirit of}} mutual admiration. Jefferson wrote that [...] "He is as pure a son of liberty as I have ever known." [...] In the will, Kościuszko left his American estate to be sold to buy the freedom of black slaves, including Jefferson's own, and <b>to</b> <b>educate</b> <b>them</b> for independent life and work. Several years after Kościuszko's death, Jefferson, aged 77, pleaded inability to act as executor due to age and the numerous legal complexities of the bequest, which was tied up in the courts until 1856. Jefferson recommended his friend John Hartwell Cocke, who also opposed slavery, as executor, but Cocke likewise declined to execute the bequest. [...] The case of Kościuszko's American estate went three times to the U.S. Supreme Court. He had made four wills, three of which postdated the American one. None of the money that Kościuszko had earmarked for the manumission and education of African Americans in the United States was ever used for that purpose. Though the American will was never carried out, its legacy went to found an educational institute for African Americans in the United States—at Newark, New Jersey, in 1826, bearing Kościuszko's name.|$|E
