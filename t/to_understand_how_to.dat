25|$|The {{sacrifice}} {{of a bear}} for Artemis started with the Brauron cult. Every year a girl between five and ten years of age was sent to Artemis' temple at Brauron. The Byzantine writer Suidos relayed the legend in Arktos e Brauroniois. A bear was tamed by Artemis and introduced {{to the people of}} Athens. They touched it and played with it until one day a group of girls poked the bear until it attacked them. A brother of one of the girls killed the bear, so Artemis sent a plague in revenge. The Athenians consulted an oracle <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> end the plague. The oracle suggested that, in payment for the bear's blood, no Athenian virgin should be allowed to marry until she had served Artemis in her temple ('played the bear for the goddess').|$|E
25|$|Adolescence marks a {{rapid change}} in one's role within a family. Young {{children}} tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship {{with his or her}} parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent–child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social media in the past, it has become a dangerous place for children. While adolescents strive for their freedoms, the unknowns to parents of what their child is doing on social media sites is a challenging subject, due to the increasing amount of predators on social media sites. Many parents have very little knowledge of social networking sites {{in the first place and}} this further increases their mistrust. An important challenge for the parent–adolescent relationship is <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> enhance the opportunities of online communication while managing its risks. Although conflicts between children and parents increase during adolescence, these are just relatively minor issues. Regarding their important life issues, most adolescents still share the same attitudes and values as their parents.|$|E

[...] A 1993 incident in which a stolen vehicle struck and killed a police officer on Deerfoot was the catalyst for the Calgary Police Service's acquisition of a helicopter. [...] 2013 statistics confirmed that Deerfoot Trail had more crashes and traffic jams than any other road in Calgary. [...] Deerfoot has many entrances and exits in close proximity which exacerbates problems, but some have attributed a portion of the congestion to driver error.

2500|$|The Vietnam War opened deep {{arguments}} about civil-military relations {{that continue to}} exert powerful influences today. One centered on a contention within military circles that the United States lost the war because of unnecessary civilian meddling in military matters. It was argued that the civilian leadership failed <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> use military force and improperly restrained {{the use of force}} in achieving victory. Among the first to analyze the war critically using Clausewitz as the theoretical basis, Harry Summers argued that the principal reason for the loss of the Vietnam War was a failure on the part of the political leadership to understand the goal, which was victory. The Army, always successful on the battlefield, ultimately did not achieve victory because it was misused and misunderstood. Summers demonstrated how the conduct of the war violated many classical principals as described by Clausewitz, thereby contributing to failure. He ended his analysis with a [...] "quintessential strategic lesson learned": that the Army must become [...] "masters of the profession of arms," [...] thus reinforcing an idea along the lines of Huntington's argument for strengthening military professionalism.|$|E

2500|$|Land {{managers}} and conservationists {{have become increasingly}} interested in preserving and restoring high quality habitat, particularly where rare, threatened, or endangered species are concerned. [...] As a result, it is important <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> identify or create high quality habitat, and how populations respond to habitat loss or change. [...] Because {{a large proportion of}} a species' population could exist in sink habitat, conservation efforts may misinterpret the species' habitat requirements. [...] Similarly, without considering the presence of a trap, conservationists might mistakenly preserve trap habitat under the assumption that an organism's preferred habitat was also good quality habitat. [...] Simultaneously, source habitat may be ignored or even destroyed if only a small proportion of the population resides there. [...] Degradation or destruction of the source habitat will, in turn, impact the sink or trap populations, potentially over large distances. [...] Finally, efforts to restore degraded habitat may unintentionally create an ecological trap by giving a site the appearance of quality habitat, but which has not yet developed all of the functional elements necessary for an organism's survival and reproduction. [...] For an already threatened species, such mistakes might result in a rapid population decline toward extinction.|$|E
2500|$|The cubic {{was first}} partly solved by the 15th/16th-century Italian {{mathematician}} Scipione del Ferro, {{who did not}} however publish his results; this method, though, only solved one type of cubic equation. This solution was then rediscovered independently in 1535 by Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia, who shared it with Gerolamo Cardano, asking him to not publish it. Cardano then extended this to numerous other cases, using similar arguments; see more details at Cardano's method. After the discovery of Ferro's work, he felt that Tartaglia's method was no longer secret, and thus he published his solution in his 1545 Ars Magna. His student Lodovico Ferrari solved the quartic polynomial; his solution was also included in Ars Magna. In this book, however, Cardano {{does not provide a}} [...] "general formula" [...] for the solution of a cubic equation, as he had neither complex numbers at his disposal, nor the algebraic notation to be able to describe a general cubic equation. With the benefit of modern notation and complex numbers, the formulae in this book do work in the general case, but Cardano did not know this. [...] It was Rafael Bombelli who managed <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> work with complex numbers in order to solve all forms of cubic equation.|$|E

Why should she not draw and explain a refrigerator as well as an air-pump? Both are to be explained on philosophical principles.

"She expects, of course, {{the very}} highest wages, if she condescends to live out; and by {{help of a}} trim outside appearance, and the many {{vacancies}} that are continually occurring in households, she gets places, where her object is to do just as little of any duty assigned to her as possible, to hurry through her performances, put on her fine clothes, and go a-gadding. She is on free-and-easy terms with all the men she meets, and ready at jests and repartee, sometimes far from seemly. Her time of service in any one place lasts indifferently from a fortnight {{to two or three}} months, when she takes her wages, buys her a new parasol in the latest style, and goes back to the intelligence-office. In the different families where she has lived she has been told a hundred times the proprieties of household life, how to make beds, arrange rooms, wash china, glass, and silver, and set tables; but her habitual rule is to try in each place how small and how poor services will be accepted. When she finds less will not do, she gives more. When the mistress follows her constantly, and shows an energetic determination to be well served, she shows that she can serve well; but the moment such attention relaxes, she slides back again. She is as destructive to a house as a fire; the very spirit of wastefulness is in her; she cracks the china, dents the silver, stops the water-pipes with rubbish, and, after she is gone, there is generally a sum equal to half her wages to be expended in repairing the effects of her carelessness. And yet there is one thing to be said for her: she is quite as careful of her employer's things as of her own. The full amount of her mischiefs often does not appear at once, as she is glib of tongue, adroit in apologies, and lies with as much alertness and as little thought of conscience as a blackbird chatters.
