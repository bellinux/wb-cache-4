5|$|Turkish cuisine is {{regarded}} as one of the most prominent in the world, its popularity is largely owed to the cultural influences of the Ottoman Empire and partly because of its major tourism industry. It is largely the heritage of Ottoman cuisine, which can be described as a fusion and refinement of Central Asian, Caucasian, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Balkan cuisines. The country's position between the East and the Mediterranean Sea helped the Turks gain complete control of major trade routes, and an ideal environment allowed plants and animals to flourish. Turkish cuisine was well established by the mid-1400s, the beginning of the Ottoman Empire's six hundred-year reign. Yogurt salads, fish in olive oil, and stuffed and wrapped vegetables became Turkish staples. The empire, eventually spanning from Austria to northern Africa, used its land and water routes to import exotic ingredients from all over the world. By the end of the 16th century, the Ottoman court housed over 1,400 live-in cooks and passed laws regulating <b>the</b> <b>freshness</b> <b>of</b> food. Since the fall of the empire in World War I (1914–1918) and the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, foreign food such as French hollandaise sauce and western fast food have made their way into the modern Turkish diet.|$|E

25|$|Cho and Garcia-Molina {{proved the}} {{surprising}} result that, {{in terms of}} average freshness, the uniform policy outperforms the proportional policy in both a simulated Web and a real Web crawl. Intuitively, the reasoning is that, as web crawlers have {{a limit to how}} many pages they can crawl in a given time frame, (1) they will allocate too many new crawls to rapidly changing pages at the expense of less frequently updating pages, and (2) <b>the</b> <b>freshness</b> <b>of</b> rapidly changing pages lasts for shorter period than that of less frequently changing pages. In other words, a proportional policy allocates more resources to crawling frequently updating pages, but experiences less overall freshness time from them.|$|E
25|$|Vladimir Becić's {{earliest}} works {{date from}} the time of the Munich school, and together with the works of Josip Račić and Miroslav Kraljević, they point to a new direction in Croatian modern painting. Moving away from traditional academic styles, they are strongly influenced by Leibl's realism, and the works of Impressionist artists such as Manet whose work they saw in an exhibit of 1907. Other influences at that time were Velázquez and Goya. Becić's later works show an approach that is closer to Cézanne, and emphasizing the structure and geometric shapes. His artistic expression was focused towards modeling and clarity. His sketches in oil, and especially watercolour, express <b>the</b> <b>freshness</b> <b>of</b> the immediate experience. He uses rich colour expression, and tone shaping for strong volume.|$|E

500|$|Before Rimsky-Korsakov {{went to the}} Conservatory, in March 1868, Tchaikovsky wrote {{a review}} of his Fantasia on Serbian Themes.

[...] Ecofeminist Greta Gaard claims that Satin [...] "played a significant role in facilitating the articulation of Green political thought". [...] Policy analyst Michael Edwards sees Satin as a pioneering trans-partisan thinker. [...] Peace researcher Hanna Newcombe finds a spiritual dimension in Satin's politics.

500|$|Gather Together retains <b>the</b> <b>freshness</b> <b>of</b> Caged Bird, {{but has a}} self-consciousness {{absent from}} the first volume. Author Hilton Als states that Angelou [...] "replaces the {{language}} of social history with the language of therapy". The book exhibits the narcissism and self-involvement of young adults. It is Rita who is the focus, and all other characters are secondary, and they are often presented [...] "with the deft superficiality of a stage description" [...] who {{pay the price for}} Rita's self-involvement. Much of Angelou's writing in this volume, as Als states, is [...] "reactive, not reflective". [...] Angelou chooses to demonstrate Rita's narcissism in Gather Together by dropping the conventional forms of autobiography, which has a beginning, middle, and end. For example, there is no central experience in her second volume, as there is in Caged Bird with Angelou's account of her rape at the age of eight. Lupton believes that this central experience is relocated [...] "to some luminous place in a volume yet to be".|$|E

Reviewing both volumes for America, John Breslin noted the similarities between the two: [...] "Even if her first book of poems had not been published simultaneously, the language she uses in Pilgrim would have given her away." [...] The Saturday Evening Post also praised Dillard's poetic ability in Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, noting that [...] "the poet in her is everywhere evident in this prose-poem of hers: the reader's attention is caught not only by <b>the</b> <b>freshness</b> <b>of</b> her insights, but by the beauty of her descriptions as well." [...] Melvin Maddocks, a reviewer for Time, noted Dillard's intention of subtle influence: [...] "Reader, beware of this deceptive girl, mouthing her piety about 'the secret of seeing' being 'the pearl of great price,' modestly insisting, 'I am no scientist. I explore the neighborhood.' Here is no gentle romantic twirling a buttercup, no graceful inscriber of 365 inspirational prose poems. As she guides the attention to a muskrat, to a monarch butterfly, a heron or a coot, Miss Dillard is stalking the reader as surely as any predator stalks its game." ...|$|E

Exceptions are [...] "La Bailarina Vecina", crafted with pure orchestral arrangements; and [...] "Ni Tú Ni Yo", a ranchera style song {{featuring}} Paquita la del Barrio.

500|$|AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a mixed review {{calling the}} soundtrack [...] "unengaging". He theorized {{that it was}} due to Madonna's performance. Erlewine commended Madonna's singing but deduced that her vocals made the songs sound like she was [...] "trying really hard to be credible, which makes it {{difficult}} to connect with her". While reviewing the film, San Francisco Chronicles Octavio Roca's feeling about the soundtrack was mixed, saying that the [...] "delicious irony of Rice's lyrics remains intact, as does <b>the</b> <b>freshness</b> <b>of</b> Lloyd Webber's music". But Roca believed that the Latin influences present in the original songs were missing, due to John Mauceri's [...] "languid conducting of the soundtrack, and most of all by Vincent Paterson's choreography". A negative review came from The Baltimore Sun; critic J. D. Considine felt the soundtrack would disappoint Madonna fans [...] "because Evita just isn't pop music—or, at least, not the kind of pop music Madonna usually makes on her own... As a result, slogging through Evita is like listening to an opera written by someone who never got beyond learning how to write recitativo". Considine was also disappointed with the vocal abilities of Madonna and co-star Antonio Banderas; [...] "they lack the power and tone to lend this intoned dialog a patina of musicality". Finally, Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly called it a [...] "soundtrack of mediocre '70s rock".|$|E
500|$|... "Love On Top" [...] is an up-tempo R song {{viewed as}} a modern take on old school music. It also {{exhibits}} elements of retro-soul music, retro-pop, the 1980s pop music, funk music, jazz, and the 1970s classic disco music, as stated by Joanne Dorken of MTV UK, Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun and Thomas Conner of Chicago Sun-Times. According to Slant Magazine Eric Henderson, [...] "Love On Top" [...] is a [...] "bright, breezy tribute to <b>the</b> <b>freshness</b> <b>of</b> mid-80s, pre-new-jack-FM R reminiscent of Whitney Houston and Anita Baker." [...] He also noted the song to be the [...] "perfect and totally inverted fraternal twin" [...] of another song on 4, being [...] "Rather Die Young". [...] "Love on Top"s retro elements are further illustrated by its use of finger snaps, a [...] "distorted" [...] bass groove, and a melding of horns as well as sweet backing harmonies, especially in the bridge and the chorus of the song. It is instrumentally complete with a thumping bassline, synthesizers, tribal drums, an arena-rock music piano, a guitar, a peppy saxophone, and some backing vocals. Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice compared [...] "Love On Top" [...] to Raydio's [...] "You Can't Change That" [...] (1979) and New Edition's [...] "Mr. Telephone Man" [...] (1984). Priya Elan of NME noted that [...] "Love On Top" [...] echoes Janet Jackson's [...] "Whoops Now" [...] (1995), Lionel Richie's [...] "Dancing on the Ceiling" [...] (1986) and the theme from My Two Dads.|$|E
