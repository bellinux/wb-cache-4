5|$|Dumouriez <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> {{frontier}} fortresses in {{the hands}} of his adherents but failed. Miaczinski botched the attempted seizure of Lille and was later executed. Dumouriez believed that he could control the regular infantry and cavalry regiments. On the other hand, the volunteers and the artillery remained devoted to the National Convention. In one incident, Dumouriez was fired on and nearly arrested by Louis-Nicolas Davout's volunteer battalion. He then made the mistake of being seen with an Austrian escort and the gunners took the lead in refusing to obey him. Seeing that his plot had fallen apart, Dumouriez defected to the Austrians on 5 April 1793. He was accompanied by the Duke of Chartres, Valence, several more generals and some cavalry. No longer bound by the previous agreement, Coburg prepared to invade France.|$|E
5|$|During 1992 and 1993, an {{estimated}} 225,000 Croats, {{as well as}} refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, settled in Croatia. Croatian volunteers and some conscripted soldiers participated {{in the war in}} Bosnia and Herzegovina. In September 1992, Croatia had accepted 335,985 refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, most of whom were Bosniak civilians (excluding men of drafting age). The large number of refugees significantly strained the Croatian economy and infrastructure. The American Ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> number of Muslim refugees in Croatia into a proper perspective in an interview on 8 November 1993. He said the situation would be the equivalent of the United States taking in 30,000,000 refugees.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was next, {{featuring}} The Undertaker versus Yokozuna in a casket match with Chuck Norris as the special outside referee. The Undertaker gained the early advantage, but Yokozuna reversed the momentum with a Samoan drop. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>The</b> Undertaker in the casket, but The Undertaker fought back. Yokozuna next performed a leg drop and placed The Undertaker in the casket. Before Yokozuna could close the lid, however, The Undertaker attacked {{him and the}} two wrestlers fought while standing in the casket. The Undertaker performed a clothesline from the top rope and placed Yokozuna in the casket. King Kong Bundy and Bam Bam Bigelow came down the aisle toward the ring, but Chuck Norris blocked their path. While Norris was distracted, however, Irwin R. Schyster entered the ring {{from the other side}} and attacked The Undertaker. He placed The Undertaker in the casket, but The Undertaker recovered before Yokozuna could close the lid. Jeff Jarrett tried to interfere on Yokozuna's behalf, but Norris stopped him with a superkick. The Undertaker performed a DDT and a big boot on Yokozuna. He then rolled his opponent in to the casket and closed the lid to gain the victory.|$|E

Headstone, overcome with the hopelessness of his situation, especially after discovering that Wrayburn has survived and has married Lizzie, is seized with a self-destructive urge and flings himself into the lock, pulling Riderhood with him so that both are drowned.|$|E
25|$|Then-U.S. Ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> {{number of}} Muslim {{refugees}} in Croatia into a proper perspective {{in an interview}} on 8 November 1993. He said the situation would be the equivalent of the United States taking in 30,000,000 refugees. The number of Bosnian refugees in Croatia was at the time surpassed only by the number of the internally displaced persons within Bosnia and Herzegovina itself, at 588,000. Serbia took in 252,130 refugees from Bosnia, while other former Yugoslav republics received a total of 148,657 people.|$|E
25|$|Polls {{taken in}} 2012 {{suggested}} {{that a majority of}} the public opinion was still opposed to it, even though Nicolas Sarkozy and a few other prominent right-wing politicians like Philippe Séguin (candidate to the mayorship of Paris in 2001) Gilles de Robien and Jean-Louis Borloo have stated publicly that they personally supported it, but that they would respect the overwhelming opposition to it within their own parties.

25|$|In early May, Bonaparte's French army won {{the battles}} of Fombio and Lodi and overran the Austrian {{province}} of Lombardy. Beaulieu evacuated Milan {{except for a}} 2,000-man garrison that he left in the citadel. In mid-May, the French occupied Milan and Brescia. At this time, the army had to pause to put down a revolt in Pavia. At the village of Binasco, the French atrociously massacred the adult male population. Beaulieu pulled his army back behind the Mincio, with strong patrols west of the river.

25|$|Arriving in Sydney England <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> {{disastrous}} Brisbane Test behind them. The wicketkeeper-batsman Paul Gibb {{was dropped}} {{in favour of}} Godfrey Evans, who was to hold the position for 13 years and who did not concede a bye in the Test. Bill Voce had pulled a muscle and the off-spinner Peter Smith was brought into the team for the traditional spinning wicket at the SCG, but already had a numb spinning finger from an injury on the ship that brought the team to Australia. Ray Lindwall was still ill with chickenpox {{and was replaced by}} the tidy fast-medium bowler Fred Freer of Victoria. The pitch looked perfect, Wally Hammond called correctly and chose to bat.|$|E
25|$|The ensuing Mother's Milk Tour put {{even further}} strain on Flea's marriage. In {{order to make}} money, he needed to tour, and {{therefore}} spent time away from his family. Furthermore, he and Smith were arrested on charges of battery and sexual harassment after a performance on MTV's coverage of spring break; charges were eventually dropped. The band was, however, attracting over three thousand people per show; Mother's Milk had been certified as a gold record in early 1990. By the time Red Hot Chili Peppers returned to Los Angeles, Flea and Loesha agreed to a separation.

Faced with these soaring costs, the Government of Quebec declared a moratorium May 19, 1976 to the all-out expansion desired by Mayor Drapeau. Tenders were frozen, including those of Line 2 after Snowdon and those of Line 5 whose works were yet already underway. A struggle then ensued between the MUC and the Government of Quebec as any extension could not be done without the agreement of both parties. The Montreal Transportation Office may have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> government {{in front of a}} fait accompli by awarding large contracts to build the tunnel between Namur station and Bois-Franc just before the moratorium entry into force.|$|E

500|$|The {{public opinion}} and the media in the city were {{overwhelmingly}} against the strikers. All the city's newspapers ran editorials denouncing the strike, which was perceived as unpatriotic and harmful to the war effort; a number of editorials also decried the racial nature of the strike. Most of the {{letters to the editor}} condemned the strike. The radio stations in the city denounced the strike as well, as did the national press. The New York Times wrote: [...] "It would be hard to find in the whole history of American labor a strike in which so much damage has been done for so base a purpose". The Wall Street Journal editorial condemned the strike but stated that the powers exercised by the government in ending the strike were only justified by the war time conditions. The Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune, while denouncing the strike, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> blame for causing it on the CIO-affiliated Transport Workers Union, and accused the Roosevelt administration of acting too slowly because of its support for the CIO.|$|E
500|$|In {{the main}} event, John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield faced The Undertaker for the WWE Championship in a Last Ride Match.

The Undertaker chokeslammed JBL through a broadcast table. The Undertaker carried JBL to the hearse but Jon Heidenreich {{came out of the}} hearse and covered his mouth with a soaked rag filled with chloroform.

JBL executed a Clothesline from Hell and helped Heidenreich place the Undertaker back into the hearse.

Astrodome publicist Molly Glentzer wrote in the Houston Press: [...] "As Vaughan shuffled back behind home plate, he was only lucid {{enough to know that}} he wanted Mickey Mantle's autograph. Mantle obliged. 'I never signed a guitar before.' Nobody asked Vaughan for his autograph. I was sure he'd be dead before he hit 30."
