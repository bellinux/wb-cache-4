Other waste products implicated in hepatic encephalopathy include mercaptans (substances containing a <b>thiol</b> group), short-chain fatty acids, and phenol.|$|E
5|$|Serine and {{cysteine}} proteases {{use different}} amino acid functional groups (alcohol or <b>thiol)</b> as a nucleophile. In order to activate that nucleophile, they orient an acidic and a basic residue in a catalytic triad. The chemical and physical constraints on enzyme catalysis have caused identical triad arrangements to evolve independently more than 20 times in different enzyme superfamilies.|$|E
5|$|Chromium, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, {{and lead}} have the {{greatest}} potential to cause harm on account of their extensive use, the toxicity {{of some of their}} combined or elemental forms, and their widespread distribution in the environment. Hexavalent chromium, for example, is highly toxic as are mercury vapour and many mercury compounds. These five elements have a strong affinity for sulfur; in the human body they usually bind, via <b>thiol</b> groups (–SH), to enzymes responsible for controlling the speed of metabolic reactions. The resulting sulfur-metal bonds inhibit the proper functioning of the enzymes involved; human health deteriorates, sometimes fatally. Chromium (in its hexavalent form) and arsenic are carcinogens; cadmium causes a degenerative bone disease; and mercury and lead damage the central nervous system.|$|E

Interestingly, the known S-vinylation of vinyl bromides and chlorides {{are limited to}} 1 -(2 -bromovinyl) benzene and 1 -(2 -chlorovinyl) benzene. Investigation on the coupling reaction of challenging alkyl vinyl bromides and chlorides with <b>thiols</b> is rare. Since the coupling of 1 -(2 -bromovinyl) benzene and 1 -(2 -chlorovinyl) benzene with <b>thiols</b> can be performed {{in the absence of}} any catalyst, here we focus on the coupling of <b>thiols</b> with alkyl vinyl halides. This system is generally reactive for alkyl vinyl iodides and bromides to provide the products in good yields. 1 -(Chloromethylidene) - 4 -tert-butyl-cyclohexane was also coupled with <b>thiols,</b> giving the targets in moderate yields...|$|R
40|$|The {{abilities}} of various peroxidases to catalyse the peroxidase-oxidase oxidation of seven aminothiols were studied. Cysteamine and cysteine esters {{were found to}} be peroxidase-oxidase substrates for eosinophil peroxidase and myeloperoxidase, whereas other <b>thiols</b> tested were inactive or poorly active with these peroxidases. With lactoperoxidase and horseradish peroxidase, all the tested <b>thiols</b> were inactive or poorly active as peroxidase-oxidase substrates. These studies suggest that a main reason for <b>thiols</b> being poor peroxidase-oxidase substrates is because these <b>thiols</b> are poor peroxidatic substrates...|$|R

25|$|When {{these agents}} chelate {{inorganic}} arsenic, it is converted into an organic form of arsenic {{because it is}} bound to the organic chelating agent. The sulfur atoms of the <b>thiol</b> groups are the site of interaction with arsenic. This is because the <b>thiol</b> groups are nucleophilic while the arsenic atoms are electrophilic. Once bound to the chelating agent the molecules can be excreted, and therefore free inorganic arsenic atoms are removed from the body.|$|E

40|$|The {{changes in}} the {{oxidation}} state of the leucocyte enzyme myeloperoxidase, induced by buffer and <b>thiols,</b> were studied with visible-light-absorption spectroscopy. It was concluded that phosphate buffer contains small amounts of H 2 O 2 and that <b>thiols,</b> when added to buffer, induce the generation of minute amounts of superoxide radical anion. These minute amounts of reduced oxygen species are suggested {{to account for the}} initiation of myeloperoxidase-oxidase oxidation of <b>thiols.</b> Myeloperoxidase was found to be in its Compound III oxidation state during myeloperoxidase-oxidase oxidation of <b>thiols.</b> However, myeloperoxidase-mediated oxidation of <b>thiols</b> with concomitant O 2 consumption can also occur with myeloperoxidase in its Compound II oxidation state. These studies indicate that the ferro and Compound III oxidation states may not be essential intermediates in myeloperoxidase-oxidase oxidation of <b>thiols,</b> but rather that the formation of the Compound III oxidation state retards the reaction...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Cerebral malaria (CM) is a {{potentially}} fatal cerebrovascular disease of complex pathogenesis caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Hydrogen sulfide (HS) is a physiological gas, similar to nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, involved in cellular metabolism, vascular tension, inflammation, and cell death. HS treatment has shown promising results as a therapy for cardio- and neuro- pathology. This study investigates {{the effects of}} fast (NaHS) and slow (GYY 4137) HS-releasing drugs on the growth and metabolism of P. falciparum {{and the development of}} P. berghei ANKA CM. Moreover, we investigate the role of free plasma <b>thiols</b> and cell surface <b>thiols</b> in the pathogenesis of CM. METHODS: P. falciparum was cultured in vitro with varying doses of HS releasing drugs compared with artesunate. Growth and metabolism were quantified. C 57 Bl/ 6 mice were infected with P. berghei ANKA and were treated with varying doses and regimes of HS-releasing drugs. Free plasma <b>thiols</b> and cell surface <b>thiols</b> were quantified in CM mice and age-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: HS-releasing drugs significantly and dose-dependently inhibited P. falciparum growth and metabolism. Treatment of CM did not affect P. berghei growth, or development of CM. Interestingly, CM was associated with lower free plasma <b>thiols,</b> reduced leukocyte+erythrocyte cell surface <b>thiols</b> (infection day 3), and markedly (5 -fold) increased platelet cell surface <b>thiols</b> (infection day 7). CONCLUSIONS: HS inhibits P. falciparum growth and metabolism in vitro. Reduction in free plasma <b>thiols,</b> cell surface <b>thiols</b> and a marked increase in platelet cell surface <b>thiols</b> are associated with development of CM. HS drugs were not effective in vivo against murine CM...|$|R

25|$|Enzymes and receptors {{that contain}} <b>thiol</b> or {{sulfhydryl}} functional groups are actively targeted by arsenite (III) metabolites. These sulfur-containing compounds are normally glutathione and the amino acid cysteine. Arsenite derivatives generally have higher binding affinity {{compared to the}} arsenate metabolites. These bindings restrict activity of certain metabolic pathways. For example, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is inhibited when monomethylarsonous acid (MMAIII) targets the <b>thiol</b> group of the lipoic acid cofactor. PDH is a precursor of acetyl-CoA, thus the inhibition of PDH eventually limits the production of ATP in electron transport chain, {{as well as the}} production of gluconeogenesis intermediates.|$|E

40|$|Phenols and aryl <b>thiols</b> are {{fundamental}} building blocks in organic synthesis and final products with interesting biological activities. Over the past decades, substantial {{progress has been}} made in transition-metal-catalyzed coupling reactions, which resulted in the emergence of new methods for the synthesis of phenols and aryl <b>thiols.</b> Aryl halides have been extensively studied as substrates for the synthesis of phenols and aryl <b>thiols.</b> In very recent years, C–H activation represents a powerful strategy for the construction of functionalized phenols directly from various arenes.

40|$|We {{describe}} a new method for the quantification of {{low molecular weight}} <b>thiols,</b> as homocysteine, cysteine, cysteinylglycine, glutamylcysteine and glutathione bound to human plasma albumin. After albumin isolation and purification by SDS-PAGE, <b>thiols</b> were freed from protein with tri-n-butylphosphine and successively derivatized with 5 -iodoacetamidofluorescein. Samples were then injected and quantified in about 18 [*]min by CE with laser induced fluorescence detection. Precision tests indicate a good repeatability of the method both for migration times (RSD< 0. 63 %) and areas (RSD< 2. 98 %). The method allows to measure all five low molecular weight <b>thiols</b> released from just 3 [*]μg of albumin thus improving the other described methods in which {{only three or four}} <b>thiols</b> were detected. Due to the elevated sensitivity (LOD of 0. 3 [*]pM for all <b>thiols),</b> also low molecular weight <b>thiols</b> bound to albumin filtered in tissues could be quantified...|$|R

25|$|Besides {{the oxygen}} ligand, which binds to {{hemoglobin}} in a cooperative manner, hemoglobin ligands also include competitive inhibitors such as carbon monoxide (CO) and allosteric ligands such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitric oxide (NO). The {{carbon dioxide is}} bound to amino groups of the globin proteins to form carbaminohemoglobin; this mechanism is thought to account for about 10% of carbon dioxide transport in mammals. Nitric oxide can also be transported by hemoglobin; it is bound to specific <b>thiol</b> groups in the globin protein to form an S-nitrosothiol, which dissociates into free nitric oxide and <b>thiol</b> again, as the hemoglobin releases oxygen from its heme site. This nitric oxide transport to peripheral tissues is hypothesized to assist oxygen transport in tissues, by releasing vasodilatory nitric oxide to tissues in which oxygen levels are low.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin is {{involved}} in the transport of other gases: It carries some of the body's respiratory carbon dioxide (about 20–25% of the total) as carbaminohemoglobin, in which CO2 is bound to the globin protein.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the acid-catalyzed condensation between levulinic acid and phenol to form diphenolic acid (DPA) was investigated {{using a combination of}} sulfonated hyperbranched poly(arylene oxindole) s and <b>thiols.</b> Taft-type steric and electronic parameters were applied to study the correlation between the nature of the <b>thiols</b> and the condensation rate. The kinetic effect of <b>thiols</b> to tune the regiochemical control was shown to be dependent on the substituent size of the <b>thiols.</b> Although <b>thiols</b> cause an increase in the regioselectivity to the desired p,p'-DPA, the isomer distribution is found to converge to a thermodynamic equilibrium at high conversions of levulinic acid.

50|$|Humans {{and other}} animals have an exquisitely {{sensitive}} sense of smell toward the odor of low-valent organosulfur compounds such as <b>thiols,</b> thioethers, and disulfides. Malodorous volatile <b>thiols</b> are protein-degradation products found in putrid food, so sensitive identification of these compounds is crucial to avoiding intoxication. Low-valent volatile sulfur compounds are also found in areas where oxygen levels in the air are low, posing a risk of suffocation.

Whether humans, too, require copper for sensitive detection of <b>thiols</b> is not yet known.|$|R
25|$|Two {{important}} biological reaction {{mechanisms of}} nitric oxide are S-nitrosation of thiols, and nitrosylation of transition metal ions. S-nitrosation involves the (reversible) conversion of <b>thiol</b> groups, including cysteine residues in proteins, to form S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs). S-Nitrosation is {{a mechanism for}} dynamic, post-translational regulation of most or all major classes of protein. The second mechanism, nitrosylation, involves the binding of NO to a transition metal ion like iron or copper. In this function, NO {{is referred to as}} a nitrosyl ligand. Typical cases involve the nitrosylation of heme proteins like cytochromes, thereby disabling the normal enzymatic activity of the enzyme. Nitrosylated ferrous iron is particularly stable, as the binding of the nitrosyl ligand to ferrous iron (Fe(II)) is very strong. Hemoglobin is a prominent example of a heme protein that may be modified by NO by both pathways: NO may attach directly to the heme in the nitrosylation reaction, and independently form S-nitrosothiols by S-nitrosation of the <b>thiol</b> moieties.|$|E

40|$|Newcastle disease virus (NDV) {{entry into}} host cells is {{mediated}} by the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. We previously showed that production of free <b>thiols</b> in F protein is required for membrane fusion directed by F protein (S. Jain et al., J. Virol. 81 : 2328 - 2339, 2007). In the present study we evaluated the oxidation state of F protein in virions and virus-like particles {{and its relationship to}} activation of F protein by HN protein, F protein conformational intermediates, and virus-cell fusion. F protein, in particles, does not have free <b>thiols,</b> but free <b>thiols</b> were produced upon binding of particles to target cells. Free <b>thiols</b> were produced at 16 °C in F protein in virions bound to the target cells. They also appeared in different fusion defective mutant F proteins. Free <b>thiols</b> were produced in the presence of mutant HN proteins that are defective in F protein activation but are attachment competent. These results suggest that free <b>thiols</b> appear prior to any of the proposed major conformational changes in F protein which accompany fusion activation. These results also indicate that HN protein binding to its receptor likely facilitates the interaction between F protein and host cell isomerases, leading to reduction of disulfide bonds in F protein. Taken together, these results show that free <b>thiols</b> are produced in F protein at a very early stage during the onset of fusion and that the production of free <b>thiols</b> is required for fusion in addition to activation by HN protein...|$|R
