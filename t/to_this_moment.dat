She manipulates {{her way into}} the room with the Secretary of State, where she tells him that the supposed meteor is really a planet, and that the heroes they tried to destroy can save them. They agree to give the heroes a chance, but give them only five minutes. In the Kent barn, Clark is attacked by Darkseid possessing Lionel's body. Jor-El taps into Clark's thoughts, showing him images of his trials over the past 10 years, revealing that his entire life has been one big trial leading <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment.</b> Harnessing the ability to fly, Clark smashes through Lionel's body, destroying it, and makes his way to the Fortress of Solitude. There, the spirit of his father, Jonathan Kent (John Schneider), presents him with the suit Martha made for him, and Clark takes to the sky, saving a crashing Air Force One, and vanquishing Darkseid by pushing Apokolips back into space.|$|E

500|$|Because of {{its large}} number (17) of {{generally}} short components, Part II {{is the most}} diffuse of the three parts, texturally and harmonically. The narrative is driven largely [...] by alternating choruses and comments from the Narrator, with two brief operatic scenas in which the four soloists participate. Kemp finds {{in one of the}} choruses an allusion to [...] "Sei gegrüsset" [...] from Bach's St John Passion, and hears traces of Elgar in the soprano's solo [...] "O my son!" [...] which begins the first scena. The narrative climax is reached with the [...] "Spiritual of Anger": [...] "Go Down, Moses", which Tippett arranges {{in the form of a}} chorale. This is followed by three short meditations from tenor, soprano and alto soloists, before a possible redemption is glimpsed in the spiritual which ends the Part, [...] "O by and by", with a soprano descant which Steinberg describes as [...] "ecstatic". Part III consists of only five numbers, each rather more extensive than most of those in the earlier sections of the oratorio. The Part has, on the whole, a greater unity than its predecessors. The musical and emotional climax to the whole work is the penultimate ensemble: [...] "I Would Know my Shadow and my Light". Kemp writes: [...] "The whole work has been leading <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> ... the ensemble flows into a rapturous wordless benediction [...] a modulation leads into 'Deep River'". In this final spiritual, for the first time the full vocal and instrumental resources are deployed. The oratorio ends quietly, on an extended pianissimo [...] "Lord".|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} {{moment in}} the character's story came when Clark decided to play football in season four, providing conflict {{between him and his}} father. Writer Darren Swimmer refers <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> as a [...] "... callback to ..." [...] in season one. To him, when Clark defies Jonathan and joins the team anyway, it signified the moment where Jonathan finally decided that he can trust Clark to not hurt anyone. Writer Todd Slavkin viewed it as Clark finally emerging from his father's shadow. Two more significant moments came during the following season. First, Clark lost his powers when he failed to return to Jor-El to finish his training; leaving him human and vulnerable. According to Welling, [...] "... learned {{a little bit more about}} what it's like to be human, physically. Emotionally, he's pretty close to trying to understand that. It added more weight to his abilities once he got them back, and it made him realize his responsibilities for what he has." [...] The second moment came in the show's 100th episode, with the death of Clark's adoptive father. The decision to kill Jonathan was made so that Clark could finally step into his destiny, allowing Clark the boy to become Clark the man, as explained by Gough. In order to do that he needed his mentor to die, so that no one would buffer him from the world any longer. Welling saw the series' 100th episode as the chance for his character to evolve and grow. John Schneider saw the same catalyst for Clark's evolution. According to Schneider, Jonathan's death inspired Clark to make the move toward his eventual destiny. Jonathan provided such an example of sacrifice that it leaves a void in Clark. To fill that void Clark would have to become Superman. It was Schneider's contention that had Jonathan not been the man he was, when the time came that the world needed Superman, Clark would have been unable to take on that persona, because he would not realize that the world needed him.|$|E
500|$|Susie's ballads occupy roughly {{one-third of}} the film, {{performing}} {{a combination of both}} contemporary and classic standards. Rosenberg compared the character to actress Marilyn Monroe's character Sugar Kane Kowalczyk in the film Some Like it Hot (1959). Susie's lack of singing experience is balanced by an [...] "ineffable vocal quality that causes people to listen, because they might be missing something." [...] Steve Vineberg, writing in the journal Film Quarterly, agreed that, despite her unimpressive voice, Susie [...] "wears a lyric tight to her skin, liked a zipped-up sleeping bag." [...] According to Télérama's Guillemette Odicino, the character has been [...] "endowed with a voice and a charm to take the breath." [...] Susie remains a heavily guarded individual until she performs [...] "Makin' Whoopee", which finally allows her to lower her defenses. When Susie performs the song, she is – for the first time – not singing to the audience, but to her sole accompanist Jack instead. According to Slant film critic Chuck Bowen, [...] "When Susie sings 'Makin' Whoopee' in a traffic-stopping red dress, mounting Jack's piano as if it's an extension of his very essence... all bets of detached, business-collaborative stability between the two are understood to be off." [...] Bowen also compared the character's performance to actress Rita Hayworth's in the film Gilda (1946). Prior <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment,</b> it almost appears as though a romantic relationship might never actually develop between the two characters. Observing that the character's tough attitude matches the difficult life she has been through, Janet Maslin of The New York Times believes that Susie must be [...] "singing from experience" [...] when she performs the song [...] "Ten Cents a Dance". Go Slow: The Life of Julie London author Michael Owen considers both Pfeiffer's performance and Susie herself to be a tribute to actress and singer Julie London, citing similarities such as asking her accompanist to perform [...] "More Than You Know" [...] in a slow tempo, swearing into a live microphone and delivering a [...] "sexy rendition" [...] of [...] "Makin' Whoopee", capturing [...] "some of the essence of Julie's style." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1987, Anderson had {{his biggest}} hit, when the uncharacteristic ballad [...] "Suddenly" [...] from the album, Beats from a Single Drum, {{was used as}} the wedding theme for the Neighbours episode in which the popular {{characters}} Scott Robinson and Charlene Mitchell married. Mitchell's character was portrayed by pop singer, Kylie Minogue, who had issued her debut single in July as a cover version of [...] "Locomotion." [...] "Locomotion" [...] was at numberone on the Australian charts preventing [...] "Suddenly" [...] from reaching the top spot. Beats from a Single Drum had been planned as Anderson's debut solo release, but had initially been billed as a Rose Tattoo album due to contractual obligations; however, after the success of [...] "Suddenly", it was re-released in 1988 as an Angry Anderson solo album. In November 1988, the single reached numberthree on the UK Singles Chart after the episode aired there. In 2009, in homage <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment,</b> the song was featured in the final episode of BBC3's comedy Gavin & Stacey, during the wedding of characters Nessa and Dave.|$|E

As a mark of {{their commitment to the}} band, Doherty and Barât both got tattoos of the word [...] "Libertine" [...] on their arms, written in Carl's handwriting.

2500|$|The Spartan {{enters the}} arena, where he meets Ares, who tells him {{he is the}} son of one of Aphrodite's handmaidens. The handmaiden had {{revealed}} Ares' affair with Aphrodite to her husband, Hephaestus. Ares killed the handmaiden, but was banished by the other gods. Knowing Ares would want to kill the handmaiden's son out of spite, the gods decided to hide him among the humans. He was thus left in Sparta as a baby and granted superhuman powers so as to protect himself should Ares ever locate him. Unable to find the child, Ares manipulated Tiberius and orchestrated the Roman invasion of Greece, knowing the war would bring the child to the fore because of his abilities. The death of The Spartan is the revenge which Ares seeks. Ares and The Spartan fight, with The Spartan killing the god. Castor and Electra then arrive, and Castor, now King of Sparta, states; [...] "It was over.

2500|$|At , the [...] "terrain ahead!" [...] warning again sounded on {{the flight}} deck. The crew {{continued}} the descent. According to MAK's report, at [...] (Decision Height) there was no [...] "landing" [...] or [...] "go-around" [...] call by the captain. If this happens, the first officer is supposed to overrule the captain, {{take control of the}} airplane, and initiate a go-around. Poland suggests that at this point the captain said [...] "Go around", and 8 seconds later the first officer confirmed by saying [...] "go around". (only the second of these two statements is recorded in the official transcripts by MAK; the first one may have been obscured by a simultaneous report by TAWS). Despite these calls, neither pilot initiated a go-around, and the descent continued. [...] One second after the 100 m altitude was reached, the TAWS alert [...] "PULL UP" [...] activated and continued to sound {{for the remainder of the}} flight. [...] "PULL UP" [...] only activates when the TAWS computer believes a collision with terrain is imminent. Therefore, when [...] "PULL UP" [...] sounds, the crew is supposed to begin an immediate, maximum performance emergency climb (full power and angle of attack to the maximum permissible without stalling) and continue climbing until the warning stops. However, the crew continued the descent. In a typical situation with an airport in the TAWS database, the [...] "PULL UP" [...] warning might not have sounded at this point. There is a method of setting up the TAWS to prevent false warnings when flying into airports not in the database, known as [...] "terrain inhibit" [...] mode; however, the crew did not utilize it. Even if they had, an excessive rate of descent and excessive airspeed can cause the TAWS to issue a [...] "SINK RATE" [...] warning followed by a [...] "PULL UP" [...] warning. This point (10:40:40 local time, approximately 20 seconds before the collision with terrain) is also notable because this was the moment when the aircraft had crossed the minimum allowed approach slope for this airport (2°10'). Prior <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment,</b> the radar controller had no reason to think that the landing attempt was not proceeding normally. The behavior of the controller was later the subject of some criticism by the Polish media. The controller remained silent for about 12 seconds after the aircraft passed the 100 m mark, and, even at that point, he did not order a go-around, but, rather issued an instruction to transit from a descent to a horizontal flight. (The decision to go around was apparently reached in the cabin of the aircraft within a few seconds of that instruction.) In addition, according to some interpretations of the radio exchange between the ground and the aircraft, the crew was instructed by the ground control to descend to [...] and either to wait for clearance to land or request one explicitly, or to inform the ground control regarding their decision whether to land or to go around. (According to MAK's report, it meant that the crew was supposed to inform the ground control of their decision to land before passing the decision altitude, and that the ground control was supposed to allow the landing as long as the runway and the airspace were clear.) None of this ever happened, with the aircraft continuing the descent through the 120 m mark while the ground control remained silent. It is unknown whether the crew really understood the ground control instruction (literally, [...] "landing additionally, 120, 3 m"), which was issued in Russian and used a relatively recent expression that was only codified in 2006.|$|E
