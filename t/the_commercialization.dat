5|$|Prior to <b>the</b> <b>commercialization</b> of the Monsanto process, most {{acetic acid}} was {{produced}} by oxidation of acetaldehyde. This remains the second-most-important manufacturing method, although it is usually not competitive with the carbonylation of methanol. The acetaldehyde can be produced by hydration of acetylene. This was the dominant technology in the early 1900s.|$|E
5|$|The Grinch realizes {{then that}} Christmas is {{something}} more than its trappings. The book criticizes <b>the</b> <b>commercialization</b> of Christmas and satirizes those who exploit the holiday. The tale was adapted into a 1966 short animated film for television with a screenplay by Seuss and narration by Boris Karloff. Later adaptations include a Broadway musical and a feature film in 2000 starring Jim Carrey.|$|E

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{themes of}} this {{research}} document examines the changes in architecture and the urban environment in relation to an event-oriented society. The urban entertainment culture of the 21 st century has spawned a host of event worlds. The marketing of cities and regions with spectacular presentations of history and culture and the redevelopment of city centers to create event spaces are an eloquent expression of this development. In ever fewer cases is this process of urban re-organisation the product of town planning schemes devised by the public authorities. <b>The</b> <b>commercializations</b> of cities is being accompanied by a loss of public space, increasing controls and a growing exclusion {{of the poor and}} destitute. <b>The</b> <b>commercializations</b> of culture is celebrating its triumphal march in the concept of the “event city”.

5|$|Tristano also {{complained about}} <b>the</b> <b>commercialization</b> of jazz {{and what he}} {{perceived}} to be the requirement to abandon the artistic part of playing in order to earn a living from performing. Later commentators have suggested that these complaints ignored the freedom that he was given by Atlantic and blamed others for what in many cases were the outcomes of his own career decisions.|$|E
5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to <b>the</b> <b>commercialization</b> and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also {{increased significantly}} following {{the invention of the}} hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among intravenous drug users.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>commercialization</b> {{of hip-hop}} dance {{continued}} into the 1990s and 2000s with the production of several television shows and movies such as The Grind, Planet B-Boy, Rize, StreetDance 3D, America's Best Dance Crew, Saigon Electric, the Step Up film series, and The LXD, a web series. Though the dance is established in entertainment, including mild representation in theater, it maintains a strong presence in urban neighborhoods {{which has led to}} the creation of street dance derivatives Memphis jookin, turfing, jerkin', and krumping.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, in {{the middle}} of the World Series match between two Bay Area {{baseball}} teams, the Loma Prieta earthquake struck and caused widespread infrastructural damage, including the failure of the Bay Bridge, a major link between San Francisco and Oakland. Even so, the Bay Area's technology industry continued to expand and growth in Silicon Valley accelerated that the United States Census confirmed that year that San Jose had overtaken San Francisco in terms of population. <b>The</b> <b>commercialization</b> of the Internet {{in the middle}} of the decade rapidly created a speculative bubble in the high-tech economy known as the Dot-com bubble. This bubble began collapsing in the early 2000s and the industry continued contracting for the next few years, nearly wiping out the market. Companies like Amazon.com and Google managed to weather the crash however, and following the industry's return to normalcy, their market value increased significantly.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs for {{products}} such as the Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the film was written by Randy Kornfield. Producer Chris Columbus rewrote the script, adding in elements of satire about <b>the</b> <b>commercialization</b> of Christmas, and the project {{was picked up by}} 20th Century Fox. Delays on Fox's reboot of Planet of the Apes allowed Schwarzenegger to come on board the film, while Columbus opted to cast Sinbad ahead of Joe Pesci as Myron. Jingle All the Way was set and filmed in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul at a variety of locations, including the Mall of America. After five weeks filming, production moved to California where scenes such as the end parade were shot. The film's swift production meant merchandising was limited to a replica of the Turbo-Man action figure used in the film.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} events were {{organized}} by agencies of the Mexican and Central American governments, and their respective tourism industries expected to attract thousands of visitors. Mexico is visited by about 22 million foreigners in a typical year. However, in 2012, the national tourism agency expected to attract 52 million visitors just to the regions of Chiapas, Yucatán, Quintana Roo, Tabasco and Campeche. A Maya activist group in Guatemala, Oxlaljuj Ajpop, objected to <b>the</b> <b>commercialization</b> of the date. A spokesman from the Conference of Maya Ministers commented that for them the Tikal ceremony is not a show for tourists but something spiritual and personal. The secretary of the Great Council of Ancestral Authorities commented that living Maya felt they {{were excluded from the}} activities in Tikal. This group held a parallel ceremony, and complained that the date has been used for commercial gain. In addition, before the main Tikal ceremony, about 200 Maya protested the celebration because they felt excluded. Most modern Maya were indifferent to the ceremonies, and the small number of people still practising ancient rites held solemn, more private ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|New {{government}} spending, regulation, {{and policies}} helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better {{than many other}} sectors. Most notably, U.S. President Barack Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included more than $70billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs. This policy-stimulus combination represents the largest federal commitment in U.S. history for renewables, advanced transportation, and energy conservation initiatives. Based on these new rules, many more utilities strengthened their clean-energy programs. Clean Edge suggests that <b>the</b> <b>commercialization</b> of clean energy will help {{countries around the world}} deal with the current economic malaise. Once-promising solar energy company, Solyndra, became involved in a political controversy involving U.S. President Barack Obama's administration's authorization of a $535million loan guarantee to the Corporation in 2009 as part of a program to promote alternative energy growth. The company ceased all business activity, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and laid-off nearly all of its employees in early September 2011.|$|E
5|$|On Christmas Eve, with Homer's help, the two steal all the Funzo toys from {{underneath}} every Christmas tree in Springfield {{with the intention}} of burning them in the town's long-running tire fire. However, Gary Coleman, who is a security guard at Kid First Industries, comes to stop them. The two parties argue all night until the next morning when they settle down into civilized discussion about <b>the</b> <b>commercialization</b> of Christmas. Coleman changes his opinion about the toy company and helps the Simpsons destroy the remaining functioning Funzo toys that were not destroyed in the tire fire. Afterwards, Homer invites Coleman to Christmas dinner at the Simpson family's house, where Mr. Burns shows up after deciding to donate money to Springfield Elementary following an epiphany he had that night.|$|E
