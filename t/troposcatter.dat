5000|$|Armed Forces in India {{has been}} using <b>troposcatters</b> as primary means of {{military}} communications since the 1950s, thereby occupying huge and expensive 2G and 3G spectrums which otherwise {{could have been used}} for expanding and de-clogging the civilian wireless communication network. The rapid expansion of civilian mobile telephony leading to need for larger bandwidth for wireless communication and commercial need to operate the 3G network necessitated the Government of India to have the Indian Armed Forces vacate the spectrum occupied by them. Thus the government of India through Department of Telecommunication (DoT) started a project called [...] "Network for Spectrum" [...] to set up a fiber optics network for the exclusive use of Indian Armed Forces in exchange for spectrum being released by the Defence Forces. The aim of 'Network for Spectrum' being twofold - to facilitate the growth of national tele-density on the one hand, and ensuring modernization of defence communications with the state-of-the-art communication infrastructure, and to support net-centric military operations.|$|R

With {{communication}} satellites used for long-distance communication links, current <b>troposcatter</b> systems are employed over shorter distances than previous systems, use smaller antennas and amplifiers, and have much higher bandwidth capabilities. Typical distances are between 50 km and 250 km, though greater distances can be achieved depending on the climate, terrain, and data rate required. Typical antenna sizes range from 1.2 meters to 12 meters while typical amplifier sizes range from 10W to 2 kW. Data rates over 20Mbit/s can be achieved with today's technology.|$|E

50|$|In 1968, the unit's name {{changed to}} the 223rd Mobile Communications squadron, as they {{received}} <b>Troposcatter</b> radios, High Frequency (HF) radios, a Tactical Communications Center, Technical Control facilities, Tactical Switchboards and Cryptographic functions.

50|$|Normally, {{signals in}} the {{microwave}} frequency range travel in straight lines, and so are limited to line of sight applications, in which the receiver can be 'seen' by the transmitter. Communication distances are limited by the visual horizon to around 30-40 miles (48-64 km). <b>Troposcatter</b> allows microwave communication beyond the horizon. It {{was developed in the}} 1950s and used for military communications until communications satellites largely replaced it in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{microwave}} energy are randomly scattered by water vapor molecules in the troposphere. This {{is used in}} <b>troposcatter</b> communications systems, operating at a few GHz, to communicate beyond the horizon. A powerful microwave beam is aimed just above the horizon; as it passes through the tropopause some of the microwaves are scattered back to Earth to a receiver beyond the horizon. Distances of 300 km can be achieved. These are mainly used for military communication.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{microwave}} beam directed {{at an angle}} into the sky, {{a small amount of}} the power will be randomly scattered as the beam passes through the troposphere. [...] A sensitive receiver beyond the horizon with a high gain antenna focused on that area of the troposphere can pick up the signal. This technique has been used at frequencies between 0.45 and 5 GHz in tropospheric scatter (<b>troposcatter)</b> communication systems to communicate beyond the horizon, at distances up to 300 km.|$|E

50|$|The 714th was {{a unique}} AC&W squadron, with its support for DEW Line {{stations}} in the Aleutians between 1959 and 1969. It {{was the only one}} that covered such a large area. It had five manned detachments at remote sites, each located about 130 miles apart stretching from just west of King Salmon all the way to Nikolski Island, about halfway to Shemya. In effect, they were responsible for radar coverage for all of the Aleutian Peninsula as well as the major Aleutian Islands. No other squadron had such a mission. Each site had an AN/FPS-19 search radar and <b>troposcatter</b> radio relay.|$|E
50|$|Tropospheric scatter (also {{known as}} <b>troposcatter)</b> {{is a method}} of {{communicating}} with microwave radio signals over considerable distances - often up to 300 km, and further depending on terrain and climate factors. This method of propagation uses the tropospheric scatter phenomenon, where radio waves at UHF and SHF frequencies are randomly scattered as they pass through the upper layers of the troposphere. Radio signals are transmitted in a narrow beam aimed just above the horizon {{in the direction of}} the receiver station. As the signals pass through the troposphere, some of the energy is scattered back toward the Earth, allowing the receiver station to pick up the signal.|$|E
50|$|ACE High was an {{abbreviation}} for Allied Command Europe; a fixed service NATO radiocommunication system which {{dates back to}} 1956. The frequency supportability and frequency assignments were profited {{in accordance with the}} NATO Joint Civil/Military Frequency Agreement (NJFA). The system was decommissioned in the late 1980s. The system was designed to be an UHF <b>troposcatter</b> radio system, which was meant to provide long-range communication service in the form of telephone and telegraph in the NATO chain of command. These services combined produced over 200 channels and equipment was in place to multiplex them to contain up to 12 different calls each. There were 82 terrestrial stations, located in 9 different NATO countries.|$|E
50|$|In 1962, Bussgang left RCA {{and founded}} Signatron Inc., an {{electronics}} firm located in Lexington. When he {{started thinking about}} founding Signatron in 1962, he started teaching at Northeastern University and continued until 1965. He also taught a course at Harvard from 1964 to 1965. Signatron developed high data rate, <b>troposcatter</b> (over the horizon) modems, HF modems and radio channel simulators. After leaving RCA, Bussgang worked as a consultant and was involved with the Apollo program. He was a consultant to Grumman Aircraft in the selection, simulation, and evaluation of Rendezvous Radar and Landing Radar for LEM (Lunar Excursion Module) for man's {{first trip to the}} moon. In 1984, he sold Signatron to the aerospace firm Sundstrand Corporation but was asked to stay with the company for three more years, so he retired in 1987.|$|E
5000|$|AAC {{operated}} two {{complete and}} one partial segments along Alaskan north coast from the Canada-US border westward {{and in the}} Aleutian Islands. Cape Lisburne AFS doubled as a DEW line site and an AAC radar surveillance site. All sites were equipped with the AN/FPS-23 continuous wave [...] "fluttar" [...] (Doppler Effect) radar. AN/FPS-19 search radars consisting of two identical radar sets feeding a dual (back to back) antenna were installed at Point Lay, Wainwright, Point Barrow (main station), Lonely, Oliktok, Barter Island (main station), and Flaxman Island. Construction started in 1955 and was completed in 1957. It tied into the AAC Aircraft Control and Warning System though the White Alice network of 33 <b>troposcatter</b> and microwave sites. Unlike the AAC radars, the DEW line stations were manned by civilian contractors, who operated the stations on 18-month renewable contracts.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} agency {{that was the}} strongest advocate for relocatable vans was the Defense Communications Agency (DCA), since renamed the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), whose responsibility it was to plan for continuity of military communications despite the possible loss of both land and satellite-based links. This necessitated the development of alternatives that would be independent of both land lines and land-based radio systems, and also satellites, {{all of which were}} thought to be possibly subject to destruction or impairment in an all-out war. The alternatives needed to be capable of being relocated, perhaps frequently, and set up rapidly in a new location when necessary. Since the facts of nuclear warfare also seemed to indicate that High Frequency (HF) Radio propagation might be disturbed by unfamiliar nuclear effects, this led to the consideration of exotic technologies such as <b>troposcatter</b> and meteor burst communication links. Such systems, while effective, used relatively small antennas and could indeed be transported efficiently and economically in relocatable vans.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{stations}} were built at high elevations, surveys indicated that during normal propagation conditions they should essentially close the gaps across Davis Strait and Denmark Strait, the latter {{with the aid}} of a later radar station at Isafjordur at the Northwestern corner of Iceland. Construction was influenced by mixed experience with two earlier ice cap radar stations near Thule (Site 1 and Site 2). The new design used pillars which would delay subsidence of the station into the ice. In this sense {{the stations}} were similar to the Texas Towers that had been built for air defense radars in coastal waters off the United States, except that the “tripod” was anchored in the ice, and the legs were eight massive steel beams. Periodic re-alignment of the station could be accomplished by adjustment of the beam attachments. At the inland stations, the nearly horizontally pointing <b>troposcatter</b> parabolic antennae had to be enclosed as part of the superstructure.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{pole line}} along the Alaska Highway was overbuilt by a modern analog microwave line that was contracted for between CNT and the US Dept. of Defence on 25 Mar 1959, completed in 1962. Like {{much of the}} northern long distance infrastructure, a long-term government contract was required to make the cost affordable, in this case, United States military need for a reliable link to its Alaska radar stations. The CNT link joined Alascom microwave facilities with Alberta Government Telephones (now Telus) microwave facilities. Other US Dept. of Defence contracts with CNT resulted in tropospheric scatterwave facilities being installed to link up Distant Early Warning Line sites, along a line stretching from Barrow, Alaska to {{the east side of}} Greenland, with a scatterwave antenna in Hay River, NWT. These <b>troposcatter</b> facilities, such as the ones between Elsa, YT and Tsiigehtchic, NT (Arctic Red River) completed in 1960, were also used from the same time to carry civilian long distance circuits until satellite facilities were implemented in the 1980s.|$|E
