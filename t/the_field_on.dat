5|$|Adams {{returned}} Tech's kickoff to the Texas 21-yard line, and the Longhorns' offense took <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> <b>On</b> {{the first}} play, Brown completed a 13-yard pass to Adams, who earned {{a first down}} at the 34-yard line. Mitchell gained four yards on a running play, then Texas was penalized for having an ineligible player downfield. On the play after the penalty, Texas was penalized for an illegal formation, negating a completed pass for a first down. The Longhorns then faced a third down and 11, but Brown's third-down pass was knocked down and the Longhorns punted to end their final possession of the first half.|$|E
5|$|After the Virginia Tech kickoff {{and a short}} return, Miami {{began the}} first drive of the game at its 32-yard line. The game's first play was an {{incomplete}} pass from Miami quarterback Jim Kelly. After a one-yard rush, Kelly completed his first pass of the game, an 18-yard toss that drove Miami to the Tech 49-yard line and gave the Hurricanes a first down. Miami then committed a 15-yard penalty, pushing the Hurricanes back into their side of <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> <b>On</b> the second play after the penalty, Kelly completed a 29-yard pass that gave Miami a first down. The Hurricanes were further aided by a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty against Virginia Tech, giving Miami a first down at the Tech 20-yard line. From there, it took Miami just three plays to score a touchdown, the final play being a 15-yard pass from Kelly to Larry Brodsky. With 12:37 remaining in the quarter, Miami took a 70 lead.|$|E

He received some votes at the Democrats' 1876 convention, but was never a serious contender as New York governor Samuel J. Tilden swept <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>on</b> the second ballot. The Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes, won the election, and Hancock refocused his ambition on 1880. The electoral crisis of 1876 and the subsequent end to Reconstruction in 1877 convinced many observers that the election of 1880 would give the Democrats their best chance at victory in a generation.|$|E

On 21 April 941, while travelling, he took part in a hunting excursion, during which he and his party inadvertently encountered a band of Kurdish brigands. During a brief skirmish, Bajkam was slain when one of the Kurds stabbed him in the back with his lance.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut {{received}} {{the ball to}} start {{the third quarter and}} drove down <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>on</b> rushing plays by Donald Brown, Jordan Todman and Tyler Lorenzen, before the drive stalled at the Buffalo 36-yard line. UConn punter Desi Cullen's punt was downed at the Buffalo 1-yard line, pinning them against their own end zone. The Bulls were unable to move the ball, punting the ball back to UConn after three plays. Starting from their own 44-yard line, the Huskies drove to within the Buffalo 10-yard line; an offside penalty on Buffalo's Jerry Housey gave UConn a 1st-and-goal at the Buffalo 4-yard line. Connecticut used a play-action pass, only their second pass attempt of the game, to fool the Bulls; UConn tight end Steve Brouse was wide open in the end zone, catching the ball for the touchdown and giving Connecticut back the lead at 24–20 with 5:22 left in the third quarter.|$|E
5|$|Following the turnover, the Tar Heels had a {{first down}} at their 32-yard line. Linton was stopped for no gain on a rushing play, passed for no gain, then {{completed}} a nine-yard pass to Brown. Failing to gain the first down, the Tar Heels punted and the ball was returned to the 30-yard line. Oxendine gained two yards on a rush up the right side, then Sorensen ran for one yard {{on the left side}} of <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> <b>On</b> third down, Sorensen scrambled for {{a first down}} before fumbling the football. The loose ball was picked up by Tech lineman Derek Smith, and the Hokies' drive continued. After a rush for no gain, another running play resulted in a Tech fumble, their second of the drive. Unlike the previous fumble, however, this one was recovered by North Carolina's Russell Davis, and the Tar Heels offense was put into position for another scoring attempt.|$|E

A game played between Port Adelaide and a composite team of the best SAFL players {{was held in the}} post season with Port Adelaide coming out as the victors with Harold Oliver awarded the best on ground with arguably the best players of the competition taking to <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>on</b> that day.|$|E
5|$|In Small Heath's {{last game}} in October, {{at home to}} Darwen, a 3–2 victory was marred by a serious injury to full-back Fred Speller. Soon after kickoff. Speller was {{in the act of}} kicking the ball when the onrushing William Campbell {{collided}} with him, knocking him to the ground. A police constable administered first aid before the player, whose leg was broken, was carried from <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>on</b> a plank and taken to hospital. On a heavy pitch in poor condition, it was nearly impossible to dribble the ball, and Small Heath's decision to play on with only one back meant Darwen's attackers were frequently caught offside.|$|E

5|$|Looking {{to improve}} their on-field product, and also to find a player with talent and star power to better compete with the Jets for New York fans' affections, the Giants {{acquired}} quarterback Fran Tarkenton from the Minnesota Vikings before the 1967 season and showed improvement. They finished 7–7 in both the 1967 and 1968 seasons. In those seasons, one of Tarkenton's favorite targets, wide receiver Homer Jones made the Pro Bowl by amassing over 2,200 yards and 21 touchdowns. The team also upset the division champion Dallas Cowboys 27–21 {{in one of their}} biggest wins in years, and the Giants' jubilant players carried Sherman off <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>on</b> their shoulders. After the game, Wellington Mara said he expected Sherman to remain the team's coach for several more seasons, however, after starting 7–3 they lost their final four games.|$|E

On {{the first play}} of their drive, Nevada took a 21-0 lead on a 28-yard touchdown pass to Sudfeld.

5|$|North Carolina's post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Virginia Tech 25-yard line, and the Hokies prepared for their second possession of the game. Parker was stopped for no gain on a run attempt, and another attempt on the next play was stopped for a loss of a yard. Facing third down, Clark attempted to scramble for the first down, but was stopped after a gain of six yards. Having gone three and out, the Hokies punted again. The kick was downed at the 36-yard line, and North Carolina's offense returned for its second possession of the game. On the first play of the drive, Linton gained two yards on a run up the middle of <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> <b>On</b> the next play, Keldorf completed a 62-yard pass to Octavus Barnes, who had broken free of the Virginia Tech defense.
