500|$|The artwork for The Blackening was {{designed}} by Robb Flynn, longtime Machine Head collaborator Paul Brown, and Deanna Alcorn. Based on a metal carving in the 16th century, these carvings were used to scare people about going to Hell and for propaganda purposes. It features a skeleton on a throne that is standing {{on top of the}} world, and the words [...] "The mirror which flatters not." [...] Flynn thought [...] "this whole record is like holding up a mirror to ourselves. It's talking about <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> on now, but it's not necessarily specific to this time." ...|$|E
500|$|Bryce Dallas Howard as Kate Connor, John's wife. Charlotte Gainsbourg was {{originally}} set {{to play the}} part, but left due to scheduling conflicts with another film. As portrayed by Claire Danes in the third film, Kate was a veterinarian; but in this film, she is now a physician. Howard suggested, {{as part of the}} character's backstory, that Kate studied medical books and interviewed many surviving doctors after the events of Judgment Day. The film's subject matter reminded her of developing countries, devastated by war and lacking basic supplies such as clean water, which [...] "reflects <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> on currently in this privileged world that we are living in where there hasn't been an apocalypse and robots haven't taken over the world. I think that's something definitely for us to reinvestigate and that we continue to make choices for our own future to take that into consideration". Howard focused on Kate [...] "being accustomed to fear and loss" [...] because the character was a military brat.|$|E

500|$|Because of RCA's {{leniency}} in the end, the band's departure was peaceful despite complications, {{and they}} still hold respect for RCA for what the label allowed them to do. Heppner credits the label for allowing the record that RCA funded to go to some other company who would want it instead, while Watchorn acknowledges that recent economic troubles would have mandated that record labels only keep [...] "the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to sell" [...] on their rosters. Heppner noted that labels usually shelve albums permanently if they are deemed unfit for commercial sale rather than give them to the artists who recorded them, and that the band were [...] "really, really lucky" [...] in comparison. Priestess found and signed with New York City independent record label Tee Pee Records to replace RCA in late 2009; Tee Pee Records had offered to sign the group years earlier, but the band chose RCA over Tee Pee. They enjoy being signed to Tee Pee Records rather than RCA, where they feel more [...] "at home". The band have stated that they feel less pressure to succeed on Tee Pee Records, {{and they do not}} feel any less important to the label compared to its higher-profile artists, such as American Idol contestants. [...] "Tee Pee is the perfect label for us right now, because they totally understand what we want to do," [...] Heppner stated. [...] "I am alas [...] stoked to be labelmates with so many wicked bands." [...] He additionally noted that the only advantage the band had when signed to RCA was more money, and that having a different kind of music meant that Priestess were not as lucrative as a band such as the Foo Fighters, who were more heavily promoted.|$|E

6000|$|The {{feeling of}} tranquillity which {{had come to}} Betty on her first {{acquaintance}} with Peaceful Moments seemed to deepen as the days went by, and with each day she found the sharp pain at her heart less vehement.

Mark my words, the whole thing is bound to end in a tremendous crash. I don't mind telling you, Duke-my friends here, I am sure, know it already--that I am more or less a revolutionary socialist. I am absolutely convinced, sir, that our modern civilization will end in a great social catastrophe. Mark what I say"--and here Mr. Fyshe became exceedingly impressive--"a great social catastrophe.

60|$|Turgot {{proposed}} that a character both of permanence and locality {{should be given}} to the provincial force; that each parish or union of parishes should be required to raise a number of men; that these men should be left at home and in their own districts, and only called out for exercise for a certain time each year; and that they should be retained as a reserve force by a small payment. In this way, he argued that the government would secure a competent force, and by stimulating local pride and point of honour would make service popular instead of hateful. As the government was too weak and distracted to take up so important a scheme as this, Turgot was obliged to content himself with evading the existing regulations; and it is a curious illustration of the pliancy of Versailles, that he should have been allowed to do so openly and without official remonstrance. He permitted the victim of the ballot to provide a voluntary substitute, and he permitted the parish to tempt substitutes by payment of a sum of money on enrolment. This may seem a very obvious course to follow; but no one who has tried to realise the strength and obstinacy of routine, will measure the service of a reformer by the originality of his ideas. In affairs of government, the priceless qualities are not merely originality of resource, but a sense for <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> wrong, and a sufficiently vigorous will to set them right.|$|E
