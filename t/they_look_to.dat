25|$|In return, Edmund {{helps her}} get {{released}} from prison so she can help her own daughter, Bianca, with her anorexia. Dimitri is also there for his former stepdaughter. At Bianca's intervention he admits he still loves Erica. Slowly, Erica and Dimitri work their way into becoming friends. He escorts her to the Crystal Ball in 1998 and <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> be {{on their way to}} a reconciliation. By the time Erica realizes she still loves him, he is presumed dead. During his funeral she talks about her and Dimitri as soul mates and acts as though she is his widow. Alexandra Devane Marick reveals that she married Dimitri during his trip to Europe. Erica does not believe Alex is the type of woman Dimitri would ever be with and doubts they were ever married.|$|E
500|$|When {{mortgage}} lenders {{consider whether}} to underwrite a particular loan, <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> {{factors such as}} the creditworthiness of the borrower and the amount of down payment the borrower will be making. [...] The amount of the down payment required by the mortgage lender can be as high as 20% of the home's purchase price. [...] In the United States, the down payment requirement can be substantially reduced if repayment of the mortgage is guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA"), an agency within the Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"). [...] The required down payment under such FHA insured loans has varied over time; in the 1990s it was 3% of the home's purchase price.|$|E
5000|$|I {{took the}} {{people by the}} hand and in their souls <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> me just as the orphan <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> his mother." ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> the Qur'an for {{orders to}} obey, not as [...] "learning and information" [...] or {{solutions}} to problems.|$|R
60|$|The {{sentinels}} {{looked out}} from the watch-towers of Loxa along {{the valley of the}} Xenil, which passes through the mountains of Algaringo. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> behold the king returning in triumph at the head of his shining host, laden with the spoil of the unbeliever. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> behold the standard of their warlike idol, the fierce Ali Atar, borne by the chivalry of Loxa, ever foremost in the wars of the border.|$|R
500|$|A third {{official}} trailer debuted on iTunes on May 3, 2012. The trailer {{was attached}} to the 3D première of The Avengers, the day after. The trailer contains what most reporters called a better and more fleshed Lizard. Adam Chitwood of Collider said, [...] "The webslinging has an edge to it and The Lizard has much more texture. I like Andrew Garfield a whole lot, and the biggest draw for me here is the character work between Garfield and Emma Stone. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> have some great chemistry and Garfield brings out a... side of Peter Parker that we didn't really see in Sam Raimi's trilogy." [...] Sandy Schaefer of ScreenRant felt that [...] "the darker color palette and 3D visuals shown here look overall quite crisp, even without the benefit of the big screen." [...] Webb felt that [...] "there's a small, intimate little indie movie at the heart of Spider-Man".|$|E
500|$|To {{represent}} the prologue to the war, the obverse {{of the monument}} (the side facing North Terrace) features a relief of the Spirit of Duty appearing as a vision before the youth of South Australia, represented in the work by a sculptural group consisting of a girl, a student and a farmer abandoning the [...] "symbols of their craft". The three are depicted in normal dress, as they are not yet soldiers and are currently unprepared for the war that is to come, and they are facing away from the world as <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> the vision before them. In Bagot's original plan, submitted for the 1924 competition, {{there was to be}} but a single nude figure kneeling before the vision (for which Bagot posed while in Europe), but Laybourne-Smith's 1926 submission became grander in its scope. In addition, Bagot's original designs were naturalistic, with the Spirit of Duty depicted as a female figure, but under Hoff's direction the figure was changed to male, and the style of the reliefs was changed to Art Deco—a [...] "radically new" [...] art style for Australia at the time. Hoff, however, presented the sculptural group in the original naturalistic style, thus providing a [...] "bridge between the Renaissance-style architecture and the Art Deco of the reliefs".|$|E
2500|$|On January 18, 2007, the {{law firm}} Borden Ladner Gervais {{announced}} that Klein, {{who is not a}} lawyer, would join their firm as a senior business adviser who would bring [...] "valuable insights to our clients as <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> do business in Alberta, in Canada, and in North America".|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> see {{her turn}} her back upon him; faint, or burst out crying; {{but she did}} neither, and only gazed at him quietly.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the release}} of the code to the public setiQuest had to find all {{instances}} that conflicted with the GPL license <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> release it in.|$|R
50|$|The band's {{original}} saxophonist Håvard Lund {{left the}} group in 1995, and <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> Bulgaria for a replacement. Trifon Trifonov joined the band after auditioning by telephone.|$|R
2500|$|According to the United States Dressage Federation, [...] "Anyone can {{volunteer}} at a schooling show to scribe. Schooling shows are not recognized as official shows but {{are a great}} way to practice riding tests or to learn to scribe for a judge. Once you have scribed at a schooling show and at the lower levels, you may ask to scribe at a recognized show and perhaps even the FEI levels of competition." [...] Scribing or pencilling is also an integral part of a judge's training as <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> become accredited or upgrade to a higher level.|$|E
2500|$|Men of the Docks is a [...] oil {{painting}} on canvas. It depicts {{a group of}} men, wearing overcoats smeared in grime, standing at a dock in Brooklyn together with some draft horses. These men appear to be day laborers, at the docks to find work. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> the left, as if receiving a message, while a large steam liner looms over them to their right. Behind them are a tugboat and the waters and ice floes of the harbor in winter. Further behind them are the skyscrapers of the lower Manhattan skyline. The winter weather about them is bleak and gray.|$|E
2500|$|Amber Holland and {{her team}} from Kronau are making their second {{appearance}} as Team Saskatchewan, and looking to improve last year's record [...] of 6-5. Making her sixth appearance in seven years, Kerry Galusha will be once again representing Yukon/Northwest Territories. The last two Scotties have seen Galusha's team in 2009 and Sharon Cormier in 2010 defeat defending champions Jennifer Jones in round robin play. This year <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> advance to the playoffs. [...] Canadian junior champion Rachel Homan will be making her debut as skip, representing Ontario after defeating defending provincial champion Krista McCarville in the Ontario finals. Alongside Homan is former Canadian junior champion Stacie Devereaux who will represent Newfoundland and Labrador, making her skipping debut at the Scotties.|$|E
5000|$|Starting on New Year's Day 2009, Satyanand {{issued a}} [...] "New Year's Message" [...] {{intended}} to highlight [...] "issues New Zealanders might consider as <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> the future".|$|R
60|$|As the chums progressed <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> {{the right}} and left, {{wondering}} if Wilbur Poole had kept to the tiny watercourse or taken to the woods, which were now exceedingly dense.|$|R
50|$|Having {{run their}} diesel engine {{in three of}} their cars {{towards the end of}} 2007, SEAT Sport entered five cars powered by their TDI engine for 2008 as <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> {{challenge}} BMW.|$|R
60|$|My exhortation, therefore, is to professors that <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> it, {{that they}} take heed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gracious, {{as far as}} that! I didn't {{know one}} could see so clearly {{for such a long}} distance. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> me to be only about three miles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush," [...] {{continued}} the niece. [...] "You will think me domineering; but please don't give any judgment without seeing; for <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> {{you as an}} arbitrator, and casual words will weigh." ...|$|E
50|$|Historians {{during the}} 1960s and 1970s found {{particular}} interest in whether the United States run according to competitive individualism or by cooperation and mutuality. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> Lumpkin’s literature to study this argument.|$|R
50|$|In January 2009, it was {{announced}} that the studio had been put up for sale by its parent company, Oxygen Games, as <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> move back to an external development business model.|$|R
50|$|Late in {{the fourth}} quarter, with the Colts leading 27-24, <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> extend the lead on a field goal by Adam Vinatieri, but it was {{overturned}} and the Colts still won 27-24.|$|R
6000|$|Humiston broke forth almost violently. [...] "Of {{course it}} isn't you; it's {{the way you}} look to me. I never paint people as <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> {{themselves}} nor to their friends. I am painting my impression of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About east by north, sir. There {{are three}} vessels; I {{can only see}} their topsails at present. Two of them are a bit bigger than the third. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> me to be merchantmen. I should say the other, by the cut of his sails, is a Frenchman." ...|$|E
60|$|What {{a thought}} {{it must have}} been for the Jews--all these people have their gods, but they are all wrong. We have the RIGHT God; the only true God. They are the people of this god, or of that; we are the people of the one true God. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> many gods; we look to the one God, who made all things, and beside whom there is none else. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> one god to bless them in one thing, and another in another; one to send them sunshine, one to send them {{fruitful}} seasons, one to prosper their crops, another their flocks and herds, and so forth. We look to one God to do all these things for us, because he is Lord of all at once, and has made all.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} week, <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> avenge {{the week}} 5 {{loss to the}} Bengals. However, they were out-played {{on both sides of}} the ball, suffered a crucial miss by Hauschka, and lost 17-7.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] Arizona Rattlers {{season was}} the 16th {{season for the}} franchise. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> make the playoffs after {{finishing}} 2006 with an 8-8 record. They finished 4-12 record and missed the playoffs.|$|R
50|$|The 2006 New York Dragons {{season was}} the 11th {{season for the}} franchise. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> make the playoffs again after {{finishing}} 2005 with an 10-6 record. They went 10-6 and made the playoffs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Any strange gentleman you mid meet in {{your journey}} might notice {{the set of}} it, I suppose. Fancy, men in love don't think so much about how <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> other women." [...] It is {{difficult}} to say whether a tone of playful banter or of gentle reproach prevailed in the speech.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{a little}} {{difficult}} to explain. You see, the idea of lowering the river was mine. Some of the boys up yonder have mortgaged their ranches, and put every dollar they could raise in that way into the scheme. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> me to put the thing through; {{so that they may}} get their money back again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and statues too, and {{buildings}} above all things. The colours of new paintings are so glaring, and the faces are so bright and self-conscious, that <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> me when I {{go to the}} exhibition like coloured prints in a child's new picture-book. It {{is the same thing}} with buildings. One sees all the points, and nothing is left to the imagination." ...|$|E
50|$|The mall barely escaped {{destruction}} {{when the}} Plainfield Tornado passed {{within a few}} hundred yards of the southwest entrance. Some shoppers report seeing nothing but a huge, black wall when <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> the southwest.|$|R
6000|$|All {{scrambled}} {{to their feet}} and brought around their weapons, ready for use. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> ward the cave-like opening and waited anxiously. Would the second bear leap out upon them and give them battle? ...|$|R
50|$|The 2003 Arizona Diamondbacks <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> {{improve on}} their 98-64 record from 2002. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> contend {{in what was}} once again a strong National League West Division. They {{finished}} {{the season with a}} record of 84-78, good enough for third place in the division.|$|R
