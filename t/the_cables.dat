5|$|Aside {{from the}} many minor {{problems}} all WindSeekers had in 2011, the first major accident occurred on June 2, 2012, on the Cedar Point installation. According to numerous news and rider reports, WindSeeker operated normally as the gondola made its way up the tower. Attached to the tower and gondola are a set of electrical cables that are located inside a plastic casing and are secured by two side panels to prevent <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> from moving around. At {{the top of the}} tower, winds were reportedly strong enough to push the electrical cables out of the socket on the tower causing <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> to move around freely. According to a rider riding WindSeeker {{at the time of the}} accident, as the gondola made its way back down the tower, <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> got stuck in the rotating gondola. The plastic casing began to be ripped apart as well as <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> causing the ride to come to a complete stop just over halfway up the tower. Because the electrical cables had been damaged, Cedar Point employees had to manually bring down the gondola. Riders were stuck on the ride for over an hour and no one was injured. WindSeeker at Cedar Point remained closed until the cause of the accident was found and fixed. The ride reopened on June 5, 2012.|$|E

50|$|On <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> below {{geostationary}} orbit, downward gravity {{would be}} greater than the upward centrifugal force, so the apparent gravity would pull objects attached to <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> downward. Any object released from <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> below that level would initially accelerate downward along <b>the</b> <b>cable.</b> Then gradually it would deflect eastward from <b>the</b> <b>cable.</b> On <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> above <b>the</b> level of stationary orbit, upward centrifugal force would {{be greater than}} downward gravity, so the apparent gravity would pull objects attached to <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> upward. Any object released from <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> above <b>the</b> geosynchronous level would initially accelerate upward along <b>the</b> <b>cable.</b> Then gradually it would deflect westward from <b>the</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{locate a}} fault in <b>the</b> <b>cable,</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> {{must first be}} tested for faults. Cable testing is {{therefore}} usually performed first in cable fault location. During <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> test, flash-overs are generated at the weak points in <b>the</b> <b>cable,</b> which can then be localised.|$|R
50|$|A trigger cable {{was laid}} across a road, when enough {{pressure}} {{was applied to}} <b>the</b> trigger <b>cable</b> two conductors inside <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> were forced together closing a circuit. <b>The</b> trigger <b>cable</b> consisted of two segments, requiring simultaneous pressure on both segments to trigger the mine. For wheeled vehicles, <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> was laid directly across the road so that wheels {{on both sides of}} the vehicle would touch <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> at <b>the</b> same instance, while for tracked vehicles <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> was laid at an angle of fifteen degrees to prevent <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> slipping between <b>the</b> treads on the tracks.|$|R
5|$|Lee spent $50,000 in {{personal}} savings to demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Chicago in 1979, using a borrowed portion of someone else's exhibit area. Lee received {{a positive response}} at the event and founded Monster, Inc. (formerly known as Monster Cable Products) later that year. Lee received an order from a Canadian distributor for 30,000 cables. The distributor wouldn't pay until the products were shipped, so Lee took out a $250,000 bank loan {{to pay for the}} production of <b>the</b> <b>cables.</b> According to Lee, he started the company without business experience or a strategy.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the Stord Bridge was undertaken {{as part of the}} same contract as the Bømla Bridge, which was awarded in December 1998 to Triangle Contractors, a joint venture between NCC and HBG Steel Structures. Most of the work was carried out by NCC with HBG having responsibility for the steel parts of the deck and <b>the</b> <b>cables.</b> HBG had previously built the steel for the Osterøy Bridge, which opened in 1997. The responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> was given to Brown Beach Associates and Hordaland Mekaniske Verksted. Construction started on 20 February 1999. After the pylons were completed on 25 September 1999, two catwalks were erected between them, with the constructors choosing two continuous catwalks instead of three separate pairs. Extra stability to the catwalks was achieved by building connections between the two.|$|E

5|$|As {{the bombers}} worked over the airfield, Aircraftman D. Roberts waited {{for them on}} the {{northern}} boundary with his parachute-and-cable launchers. Three Do 17s were heading towards him, climbing slowly. When they were in range he fired <b>the</b> <b>cables.</b> Nine rockets flew upwards. Wilhelm Raab saw the rockets go up. Although {{he did not understand}} what they were, he banked the Do 17 to avoid the lines of smoke {{that may or may not}} have concealed something. Because the Dornier banked, one of <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> that hit his bomber slid off the wing before the lower parachute had time to deploy. Pilot Petersen's Dornier was not that lucky. Already on fire it ran into the cable which dragged it out of the sky. The Do 17 crashed killing all five crewmen. Oberleutnant Rudolf Lamberty (carrying Joachim Roth) also managed to avoid a collision, but before he could do so fire hit his Dornier destroying the fuel tanks. The bomber caught fire and he was barely able to keep control. Eventually it crash-landed at Leaves Green in Kent after being shot down by No. 111 Squadron Hurricanes. Roth was killed, but Lamberty survived with burns.|$|E
5|$|Because the self-anchored {{structure}} {{relies on}} the roadway itself to absorb stresses, the suspension cables could not be installed until the roadway was built; however, until <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> were in place the roadway could not be supported. To resolve this problem, Topham had the roadway built in sections, supported on very tall barges. The barges were floated into place at low tide, and the rising tide was used to lift the sections above {{the height of the}} piers. As the tide ebbed, the roadway dropped into place.|$|E

The Athenians eventually caught Artayctes, killing some of the Persians with him but taking most of them, including Artayctes, captive. Artayctes was crucified {{at the request of}} the people of Elaeus, a town which Artayctes had plundered while governor of the Chersonesos. The Athenians, having pacified the region, then sailed back to Athens, taking <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> from the pontoon bridges with them as trophies.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{enters the}} space station via an airlock. She cannot re-establish {{communication}} with Kowalski and concludes that she is now the sole survivor. Inside the station, a fire breaks out, forcing her to rush to the Soyuz. As she maneuvers the capsule away from the ISS, the tangled parachute tethers prevent it from separating from the station. Stone performs a spacewalk in order to release <b>the</b> <b>cables,</b> succeeding just as the debris field completes its orbit and destroys the station. Stone aligns the Soyuz with Tiangong, but discovers that Soyuz's engine has no fuel.|$|E
5|$|Tests done by audiophile publications, news {{reporters and}} {{academics}} reached conflicting conclusions on whether more expensive audio or video cables like those from Monster {{make a difference}} in audio or video quality when compared to generic cables.

50|$|Overbending of <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> {{occurs when}} <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> is bent in a radius {{of less than}} the minimum bending radius defined by the manufacturer. Although <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> may {{initially}} survive the overbending, {{this can lead to}} subsequent fatigue within <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> ultimately leading to <b>cable</b> failure. <b>The</b> CPS selected should maintain a radius which is greater than the specified minimum bend radius.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cable</b> jetting is <b>the</b> {{process of}} blowing a cable through a duct while {{simultaneously}} pushing <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> into <b>the</b> duct. Compressed air is injected at the duct inlet and {{flows through the}} duct and along <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> at high speed. (Preferably, no suction pig is used at <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> head.) <b>The</b> high speed air propels <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> due to drag forces and pressure drop. The friction of <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> against <b>the</b> duct is reduced by the distributed airflow, and large forces that would generate high friction are avoided. Because of the expanding airflow, the air propelling forces are relatively small at <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> inlet and large at the air exhaust end of the duct. To compensate for this, an additional pushing {{force is applied to}} <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> by <b>the</b> jetting equipment. The pushing force, acting mainly near <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> inlet, combined with the airflow propelling forces, increases the maximum jetting distance considerably. Special lubricants have been developed for cable jetting to further reduce friction.|$|R

5|$|Cully and his thugs arrive as the McCoys try to leave. A violent gunfight ensues in the halls, stairwell, and {{elevator}}; all Cully's men {{are killed}} but one, who Doc allows to run away. Cully himself dies when Doc shoots <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> {{of the elevator}} he is in and it crashes {{to the bottom of}} the shaft. Rudy comes to his senses, follows Doc and Carol outside onto a fire escape, and shoots at them. Doc returns fire and kills him. With the police on the way, the couple hijack a pickup truck and force the driver, a cooperative old cowboy, to take them to Mexico. After crossing the border, Doc and Carol pay the cowboy $30,000 for his truck. Overjoyed, the cowboy heads back to El Paso on foot, while the couple continue into Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|Nipples {{are also}} {{available}} separately from <b>the</b> <b>cable,</b> for purposes of repair or custom cable construction. They are fitted to <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> by soldering. Where free rotation of nipples, relative to <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> axis is required, <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> end may be finished with a brass ferrule or [...] "trumpet" [...] soldered to <b>the</b> <b>cable.</b> <b>The</b> barrel nipple will be a sliding fit over the brass ferrule, and can thus rotate, to ensure alignment of the nipples {{at each end of}} <b>the</b> <b>cable,</b> and avoidance of twisting of <b>the</b> inner <b>cable.</b> Applying heat to <b>the</b> inner <b>cable</b> for soldering may weaken the steel, and although soft soldering is less strong than silver solder, a lower temperature is required to form the joint, and there is less likelihood of <b>the</b> inner <b>cable</b> being damaged as a result.

5|$|Plans for a {{crossing}} {{arose in}} the 1960s; and until the 1990s proposals were for a pontoon bridge further north. The Stord Bridge was conceived after the decision to combine the crossing with the Bømlafjord Tunnel. The project was resisted both by local environmental groups and the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, the latter because the new plans would delay completion. Construction was undertaken by a joint venue between NCC and HBG Steel Structures. Construction started in 1999 {{and was the first}} bridge in Norway to have <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> spun on-site.
