A wire wound coil is the secondary winding. The current through the secondary winding is zero at the balanced condition. In balance condition, the flux due to the current through the phase wire will be neutralized by the current through the neutral wire, since the current, which flows from the phase {{will be returned to}} the neutral. When a fault occurs, a small current will flow to the ground also. This makes an unbalance between line and netural current and that creates an unbalanced magnetic field.

This {{may be related to}} the proximity of the sensing and defibrillation (DF) electrodes, and due to local conduction block in areas of high potential gradients. Potential gradients of > 64 V/cm have been shown to cause local conduction block. To study the effect of lead geometry on potential gradient at <b>the</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>circuit</b> following a high voltage shock, a finite element model was constructed to simulate three TV ICD leads: Endotak 60 TM, TVLTM, and TransveneTM. The first two lead systems use integrated bipolar sensing (tip to distal DF coil); the latter uses true bipolar sensing (tip to ring electrode). The model consisted of a three-dimensional, cylindrically symmetric right ventricle, with the lead surrounded by blood except at the distal electrode, which was in contact with myocardium. The model was calculated assuming an applied voltage of 650 V at the distal DF coil, with the proximal DF coil at 0 V. The potential gradient at each point of a 635 to 824 node finite element model was solved using LaPlace's equation, assuming typical values for conductivity of blood (0. 01 S/cm) and myocardium 10. 002 S/cm).

The SOC technique, inwhich memory designs overtake the logical circuits, results in new demands of embeddedmemory. More functions of memories could provide more powerful chip performances, butthey were also in predicaments of larger chip size and worse yield. For the memory cells,either the cell structure or the operating mode must be adjusted for the advanced processtechnologies. For the memory peripherals, the system power efficiency or sensing speedshould be affected due to the lower operating voltages and scaled-down processes. Therefore,the design concept for those circuit modules needs to be modified.

We discuss the design of a real WSN node for gas sensing and evaluate it with respect to an identical platform that uses the Wheatstone bridge. The proposed approach ensures significant energy savings and helps to avoid zero offset issue.

Second, I also proposed the embedded capacitive touch <b>sensing</b> <b>circuit</b> to realize <b>the</b> touch function. I realize a variable capacitor by forming the self- and/ or mutual capacitance in the TFT circuit layer. In addition, I also proposed <b>the</b> compensation <b>sensing</b> <b>circuit</b> to improve <b>the</b> touch sensitivity. This circuit can not only compensate for the threshold voltage of driving TFT but also detect the touches. The simulation results show that the proposed circuits can detect the touches by using the integrator’s output and the variation of the integrator’s output of the proposed circuit is very small...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{receiver}} configuration which {{is able to}} distinguish between right hand and left hand circular polarization <b>senses.</b> <b>The</b> <b>circuit</b> discriminates between <b>the</b> polarization <b>senses</b> by switching between low-side and high-side LO injection when mixing down to IF. The prototype receiver shows 20 dB cross-pol rejection with 12 dB conversion loss. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We present ultra-compact {{wavelength}} filters in SOI photonic wires: Mach-Zehnder lattice {{filters and}} ring resonators, {{as well as}} demultiplexers such as AWGs, and planar concave gratings. We also discuss devices for WDM communication and <b>sensing.</b> <b>The</b> <b>circuits</b> were fabricated with CMOS Technology. I...|$|R
