We investigate and report {{the effects of}} relational orientations (reciprocity orientation and communal orientation) on employee preference of choosing sides between an acquaintance and a friend in a workplace dispute in The Netherlands and China. A scenario study was conducted among 104 Dutch and 105 Chinese employees. As hypothesized, {{the results indicate that}} employees, especially Dutch employees, with an interest-concerned reciprocity orientation <b>tend</b> to <b>side</b> with the acquaintance who has a greater potential to return the favour. By contrast, employees, especially Chinese, with a sharing-concerned communal orientation <b>tend</b> to <b>side</b> with their workplace friend. Explanations and implications of the findings are discussed. Department of Management and Marketin...|$|R

5000|$|From the onset, {{critics of}} the Evangelical Popular Mission of France {{have pointed out that}} the mission was preaching social {{conformity}} and resignation to the working class under the guise of evangelisation. Robert McAll himself always appeared in public clothed as a wealthy bourgeois: black redingote, golden watch chain, carefully <b>tended</b> <b>side</b> whiskers. The Mission organisation is extremely hierarchical, and a difference will always remain between the [...] "gentlemen of the governing committee" [...] and the converts. These points caused controversy with supporters of the [...] "Christianisme social" [...] (Christian Socialism), another Protestant movement sharing the sensitivity of the Evangelical Popular Mission of France regarding the working class living conditions but harbouring more socialist feelings. There was a major conflict between the Evangelical Popular Mission of France and the liberal pastor of Roubaix Élie Gounelle in 1907.|$|R

Choice of color depends on many factors, and can include availability, and personal preference, or may adhere to some sort of color code. No color codes appear to be mandatory or universal, but certain colors do tend to be used for specific purposes.|$|R
