5|$|When Wilson {{proposed}} {{establishment of}} a League of Nations, with the League's charter part of the Treaty of Versailles, Taft expressed public support. He was {{out of step with}} his party, whose senators were not inclined <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> treaty. Taft's subsequent flip-flop on the issue of whether reservations to the treaty were necessary angered both sides, destroying any remaining influence he had with the Wilson administration, and causing some Republicans to call him a Wilson supporter and a traitor to his party. The Senate refused <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> Versailles pact.|$|E
5|$|Gore also {{supported}} {{the funding of}} the controversial, and much-delayed satellite called Triana, which would have provided {{an image of the}} Earth 24 hours a day, over the internet and would have acted as a barometer measuring the process of global warming. During his 2000 presidential campaign, Gore ran, in part, on a pledge <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> Kyoto Protocol.|$|E

50|$|States may when <b>ratifying</b> <b>the</b> Convention, <b>ratify</b> subject <b>to</b> {{reservations}} or interpretations. Besides other obligations, {{ratification of}} the Convention would require the United States to submit reports, outlining its implementation on the domestic level, to the U.N.

5|$|On January 14, 1919, Indiana {{became the}} twenty-fifth state <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> Eighteenth Amendment, which {{mandated}} nationwide prohibition. Three days later Nebraska became the thirty-sixth state <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> amendment, providing the two-thirds majority of states required {{to amend the}} U.S. Constitution. With the beginning of nationwide Prohibition on January 17, 1920, after formal ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment the previous day, efforts turned to enforcement of the new law. Protestant support for Prohibition remained intense in Indiana in the 1920s. Shumaker and the IASL lead a statewide grassroots campaign that successfully passed a new prohibition law for the state. Sponsored by Indiana representative Frank Wright and known as the Wright bone-dry law, it was enacted in 1925. The Wright law {{was part of a}} national trend toward stricter prohibition legislation and imposed severe penalties for alcohol possession.|$|E
5|$|From 1786 to 1787, {{an armed}} uprising, known as Shays' Rebellion led by Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays wrought havoc {{throughout}} Massachusetts and ultimately attempted {{to seize the}} Federal armory. The rebellion {{was one of the}} major factors in the decision to draft a stronger national constitution to replace the Articles of Confederation. On February 6, 1788, Massachusetts became the sixth state <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> United States Constitution.|$|E
50|$|Tajikistan {{plans to}} join the Customs Union. The country has signed the CIS Free Trade Zone Agreement and is close <b>to</b> <b>ratifying</b> <b>the</b> treaty. A border dispute with EEU member Kyrgyzstan has arisen as a {{potential}} obstacle. Support for joining the bloc remains high in Tajikistan, according to polls conducted by the Eurasian Development Bank in October 2016, showed that 68 percent of people quizzed in Tajikistan favored membership.|$|R
50|$|A second {{council was}} held at Tarragona in 1234 to {{regulate}} the procedure of the Inquisition, which had begun in 1233. and <b>to</b> also <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> findings of the Toulouse Council.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>ratifying</b> <b>the</b> official NOBE Constitution at the 2010 NOBE National Conference, {{the first}} national governing board was formed to continue growth {{and development of the}} national organization. Elections were held for 5 positions. Katy Hoover, from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign chapter, was elected the first president of the national organization. Other positions were filled by Adam Brunner (Vice President), Andrew Quinn (Finance Director), Kevin Daley (Secretary), and David Grochocki (Technology Director).|$|R
5|$|In 1917, Dudley {{became the}} Third Vice President of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, where she contributed {{significantly}} to advancing legislation {{on the issue of}} women's suffrage. In 1920, Dudley, along with Catherine Talty Kenny and Abby Crawford Milton, led the campaign in Tennessee to approve ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. On August 18, Tennessee became the 36th and deciding state <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> amendment, thereby giving women the right to vote throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|Jogaila {{formulated}} the Treaty of Dubysa, which rewarded the Knights {{for their}} aid in defeating Kęstutis and Vytautas by promising Christianisation and granting them Samogitia {{west of the}} Dubysa river. However, when Jogaila failed <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> treaty, the Knights invaded Lithuania {{in the summer of}} 1383. In 1384, Jogaila reconciled with Vytautas promising to return his patrimony in Trakai. Vytautas then turned against the Knights, attacking and looting several Prussian castles.|$|E
5|$|The Afghan people revolted {{against the}} PDPA {{government}} {{when the government}} introduced several socialist reforms, including land reforms. By early 1979, twenty-five out of Afghanistan's twenty-eight provinces were unsafe because of armed resistance against the government. On 29 March 1979, the Herat uprising began; the uprising turned the revolt into an open war between the Mujahideen and the Afghan government. It was during this period that Amin became Kabul's strongman. Shortly after the Herat uprising had been crushed, the Revolutionary Council convened <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> new Five-Year Plan, the Afghan–Soviet Friendship Treaty, and to vote {{on whether or not}} to reorganise the cabinet and to enhance the power of the executive (the Chairman of the Revolutionary Council). While the official version of events said that all issues were voted on democratically at the meeting, the Revolutionary Council held another meeting the following day <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> new Five-Year Plan and to discuss the reorganisation of the cabinet.|$|E
50|$|Australian {{politicians}} initially resisted {{ratification of}} the Statute. John Latham, the Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs under Prime Minister Joseph Lyons, was particularly opposed <b>to</b> <b>ratifying</b> <b>the</b> Statute, {{because he thought it}} would weaken military and political ties with the United Kingdom. Latham had attended both the 1926 Imperial Conference and the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, and he had much experience in international affairs. He preferred that the relationship between the United Kingdom and the Dominions not be codified in legislation.|$|R
50|$|Japan {{signed the}} CRPD in September 2007, but took until January 2014 <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> it. <b>The</b> long delay {{was due to}} various {{legislative}} amendments and policy reforms {{that had to be}} in place before ratification.|$|R

5|$|The {{question}} in the 1980 referendum, {{in an attempt to}} build a broad coalition, had sought only the authority to negotiate sovereignty with the Canadian government, and promised a second referendum <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> results of any negotiation. Parizeau believed a second referendum was unnecessary and would only encourage the remainder of Canada to use delaying tactics. The draft initial Act featured a question only asking for the authority to declare Quebec sovereign.|$|E
5|$|Treaties among Panama, Colombia, and the United States {{to resolve}} {{disputes}} {{arising from the}} Panamanian Revolution of 1903 had been signed by the lame-duck Roosevelt administration in early 1909, and were approved by the Senate and also ratified by Panama. Colombia, however, declined <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> treaties, and after the 1912 elections, Knox offered $10 million to the Colombians (later raised to $25 million). The Colombians felt the amount inadequate, and requested arbitration; the matter was not settled under the Taft administration.|$|E
5|$|As the {{political}} situation deteriorated, Whitlam and his government continued to enact legislation: The Family Law Act 1975 provided for no-fault divorce while the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 caused Australia <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination that Australia had signed under Holt, but which had never been ratified. In August 1975, Whitlam gave the Gurindji people of the Northern Territory title deeds to part of their traditional lands, beginning the process of Aboriginal land reform. The next month, Australia granted independence to Papua New Guinea.|$|E
50|$|To {{enter into}} force, the Convention {{required}} three states <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> or accede <b>to</b> it. In 1976, Turkey was <b>the</b> first country <b>to</b> <b>ratify.</b> Italy <b>ratified</b> <b>the</b> Convention in 1995 and Malta ratified in 2015. As a result, the Convention entered into force on 28 July 2015.|$|R

5|$|Elizabeth's first {{policy toward}} Scotland was {{to oppose the}} French {{presence}} there. She feared that the French planned to invade England and put Mary, Queen of Scots, who was {{considered by many to}} be the heir to the English crown, on the throne. Elizabeth was persuaded to send a force into Scotland to aid the Protestant rebels, and though the campaign was inept, the resulting Treaty of Edinburgh of July 1560 removed the French threat in the north. When Mary returned to Scotland in 1561 to take up the reins of power, the country had an established Protestant church and was run by a council of Protestant nobles supported by Elizabeth. Mary refused <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> treaty.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton's faction {{were against}} any {{conditional}} ratification, {{under the impression}} that New York would not be accepted into the Union, while Clinton's faction wanted to amend the Constitution, while maintaining the state's right to secede if their attempts failed. During the state convention, New Hampshire and Virginia becoming the ninth and tenth states <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> Constitution, respectively, had ensured any adjournment would not happen and a compromise would have to be reached. Hamilton's arguments used for the ratifications were largely iterations of work from The Federalist Papers, and Smith eventually went for ratification, though it was more out of necessity than Hamilton's rhetoric. The vote in the state constitution was ratified 30 to 27, on July 26, 1788.|$|E
5|$|He was {{commissioned}} a second {{lieutenant in the}} Marine Corps on October 9, 1917 and in September {{of the next year}} he sailed for France with the 11th Marines. This regiment saw no combat, but during the last six months of his European tour, he commanded Company D, 15th Separate Marine Battalion, which had been organized {{for the express purpose of}} assisting in the holding of a plebiscite in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Owing to the failure of the United States <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> Treaty of Versailles, this mission, however, was never carried out.|$|E

5|$|In 1685 Siam {{attempted}} to cede Singora to France: the {{hope was that}} the French East India Company, supported by a garrison of troops, could rebuild the city, establish a trading post and counter the strong regional Dutch influence. The city was offered to France's envoy to Siam, the Chevalier de Chaumont, and a provisional treaty signed in December; Siamese ambassador Kosa Pan sailed to France the following year <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> cession. The French, however, were not interested: Secretary of State for the Navy, the Marquis de Seignelay, told Kosa Pan that Singora was ruined and of no further use, {{and asked for a}} trading post in Bangkok instead.|$|E
5|$|In 62 BC, Pompey {{returned}} victorious from Asia, but {{the senate}} refused <b>to</b> <b>ratify</b> <b>the</b> arrangements {{that he had made}} with his soldiers. Pompey, in effect, became powerless, and thus when Julius Caesar returned from his governorship in Spain in 61 BC, he found it easy to make an arrangement with Pompey. Caesar and Pompey, along with Crassus, established a private agreement, known as the First Triumvirate. Under the agreement, Pompey's arrangements in Asia were to be ratified, and his soldiers were to be given land. Caesar was to be elected Consul in 59 BC, and then serve as governor of Gaul for five years. Crassus was to be promised a future Consulship.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>ratifying</b> <b>the</b> Convention, a {{state party}} must voluntarily {{submit to the}} Court's jurisdiction {{for it to be}} competent to hear a case involving that state.
