500|$|The {{results of}} Gay's first 2004 US Olympic Trials {{confirmed}} {{his status as}} a rising contender in the 100m and 200m events. Although he did not reach the final of either event, he reached the semis of the highly competitive 100m and posted a 200m personal best of 20.07s in the qualifying stages. A hamstring injury due to dehydration prevented Gay from competing in the 200m final, but he did not see the trials as a missed opportunity, rather a springboard for future events: [...] "I was really focused upon the team, had a great shot, but it was a learning experience—how <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> body." [...] The end of year Track and Field News rankings for United States sprinters showed him to be the eighth fastest 100m runner and the fourth fastest sprinter over 200m that year—indicative of his potential, he was younger than all those ranked ahead of him.|$|E
500|$|Aaliyah {{was known}} to have usually been {{accompanied}} by {{members of her family}} and the [...] "Rock the Boat" [...] filming was credited by Rashad Haughton as being the first and only time her family was not present. In October 2001, Rashad stated: [...] "It really boggles everyone [...] from Day One, every single video she ever shot there's always been myself or my mother or my father there. The circumstances surrounding this last video were really strange because my mother had eye surgery and couldn't fly. That really bothered her because she always traveled. My dad had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mom at that time. And I went to Australia to visit some friends. We really couldn't understand why we weren't there. You ask yourself maybe we could have stopped it. But you can't really answer the question. There's always gonna be that question of why." [...] Her friend Kidada Jones said {{in the last year of}} her life her parents had given her more freedom and she had talked about wanting a family. [...] "She wanted to have a family, and we talked about how we couldn't wait to kick back with our babies." ...|$|E

[...] His father says he knows how much pain his incarceration caused his son, but insists he did the best he could. [...] "I sent him {{to live with his}} grandmother," [...] he says. [...] "It wasn't like I left him with strangers." [...] In the absence of his father, boxing became an outlet for Mayweather. As the elder Mayweather served his time, his son put all of his energy into boxing and dropped out of high school. [...] "I knew that I {{was going to have to}} try <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mom and I made the decision that school wasn't that important at the time and I was going to have to box to earn a living," [...] he said.|$|E

I brought {{these girls}} along <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> me--three of 'em, sir--and they've {{got to do}} their duty. Don't you worry about the girls; just you worry about me." ...|$|R

2500|$|West {{was charged}} with violating Articles 128 (assault) and 134 (general article) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. During a hearing held {{as part of an}} Article 32 {{investigation}} in November 2003, West stated, [...] "I know the method I used was not right, but I wanted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> soldiers." [...] The charges were ultimately referred to an Article 15 proceeding rather than court-martial, at which West was fined $5,000. West accepted the judgment and retired with full benefits as a lieutenant colonel in the summer of 2004. Asked if he would act differently under similar circumstances, West testified, [...] "If it's about the lives of my soldiers at stake, I'd go through hell with a gasoline can." [...] At his hearing, West said that there were no ambushes against American forces in Taji until he was relieved of his leadership post a month later. After West's retirement he received more than 2,000 letters and e-mails offering him moral support. A letter supporting West was signed by 95 members of the U.S. Congress and sent to the Secretary of the Army.|$|E
2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with his {{teammate}} Ron Rightnowar, there was some bitterness toward Givens by the major-leaguers because of his role as a replacement player. [...] "I've spent 11½ years in the minor leagues, I have a mortgage and two kids to feed", he told the Sporting News in 1995. [...] "I had to pay my bills, and I couldn't see quitting not after what I've been through." [...] However, Givens also said given the chance to do it again, he would not have been a replacement player. [...] "Now that I'm here and I see how everything works, I regret what I did", Givens said in July 1995. [...] "I was really undecided and didn't want to do it, then I said I would. [...] One thing about this team, there's a bunch of really good guys here. [...] Maybe they're not all going to be our best friends off the field, but when we're on the field they're going to support us like we support them." [...] In a different interview, Givens went one step further, dismissing the talent level of some of his fellow replacement players. [...] "At the time, it's what I had to do", he told the Seattle Times in July 1995. [...] "I told everyone on the team that. [...] Of course, I regretted the decision. But I had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> family. [...] Those games were a joke. [...] The talent level was horrible. [...] To put myself in the same shoes with guys off the street made me sick. [...] It wasn't really baseball." ...|$|E

Once back in Hong Kong Jacky shows Jolie that he wants <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> her, not because he has to but because he wants to.
