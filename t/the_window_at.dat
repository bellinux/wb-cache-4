5|$|From {{an early}} age, Reines {{exhibited}} {{an interest in}} science, and liked creating and building things. He later recalled that: The first stirrings of interest in science that I remember occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school, when, looking out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope, I noticed something peculiar about the light; it was the phenomenon of diffraction. That began for me a fascination with light.|$|E
5|$|The {{liner notes}} of Seeger's Songs of Struggle and Protest, 1930–50 tell a {{different}} story of the song's creation; they state that Guthrie wrote the song while airborne on a flight into Pittsburgh. While looking out <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the smoky skies, he quickly jotted down the lyrics.|$|E
5|$|The {{window in}} the centre north wall has two lights (sections of window {{separated}} by a mullion); there are two pairs of two-light windows in the south wall. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the east end {{had a pair of}} lights, topped by trefoils (a stonework pattern of three overlapping circles).|$|E

5|$|The {{remains of}} the priory church are {{dominated}} by the eastern gable wall of the presbytery that still stands to its full height. Its great east window is {{regarded as one of}} the finest examples of late-13th-century church architecture. The design is so close to that of the eastern arm of Ripon Cathedral, which was built around the same time, that it is thought to have been modelled on Ripon's design. The window's tracery has disappeared, as has its sill, but from the stubs and surviving fragments it can be deduced that it had seven major lights (the glazed openings in <b>the</b> <b>window).</b> <b>At</b> its centre was a great circle of tracery filled with trefoiled lights. The main gable of the east wall is flanked by massive buttresses capped with gables and octagonal pinnacles. A similar pair of pinnacles top the main gable, flanking a window of unusual design; a bracket projects from the lower lobe to support a statue (no longer present), possibly of the Virgin Mary, to whom the priory was dedicated.|$|E
5|$|The royal arms of CharlesII are in {{the north}} aisle. During the 1852 {{restoration}} whitewash {{was removed from the}} walls, revealing the royal arms of HenryVII, and paintings which include one of The Blessed Virgin knighting St George. Stained glass in the west windows of both aisles dates from around 1500. Other glass comes from the Victorian era. This includes the east window from about 1858, and <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the east end of the north aisle from about 1861, both by William Warrington, and the east window in the south aisle from about 1872 by Ward and Hughes. The two westernmost windows in the south aisle are by O'Connor and dated 1871. There are later windows from 1920 in the south wall of the Lady Chapel. In the north aisle is a small part of an Anglo-Saxon circular cross-shaft carved with interlace decoration dating from the late 10th or the 11thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The {{stained glass}} in the east window, dated 1856, was made by William Wailes. The glass in a south window in the chancel of 1909 was made by Morris & Co. The east window in the north aisle, dated 1920 is by Irene Dunlop. The stained glass window {{to the left of}} the pulpit was donated by the Greg family of Styal Mill. The stained glass in <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the west end of the north aisle is to the memory of the wife of Edward John Bell, rector from 1870 to 1907, and was made by Clayton and Bell in 1877. The tower holds a ring of six bells, hung for change ringing, five of which were cast in 1787 by Rudhall of Gloucester, and the sixth by Charles and George Mears at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1847. A seventh, unused, bell dates from 1686 and has been noted as being of {{historical}} importance by the Church Buildings Council of the Church of England. The parish registers begin in 1629, and the churchwardens' accounts in 1612.|$|E

25|$|The first {{permanent}} photoetching was {{an image}} produced in 1822 by the French inventor Nicéphore Niépce, {{but it was}} destroyed in a later attempt to make prints from it. Niépce was successful again in 1825. In 1826 or 1827, he made the View from <b>the</b> <b>Window</b> <b>at</b> Le Gras, the earliest surviving photograph from nature (i.e., {{of the image of}} a real-world scene, as formed in a camera obscura by a lens).|$|E
25|$|In Chapter 25, Lamb meets {{a little}} girl with her broken leg in a cast who spends the day looking out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the neighbours, whom she has given fanciful {{descriptive}} names. The inspiration for this plot device is possibly Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film, Rear Window, a nod to a classic. In the same chapter, the little girl refers to a neighbour called Miss Bulstrode, though {{it seems unlikely that}} the character is the same Miss Bulstrode from Cat Among the Pigeons.|$|E

25|$|Ginny (Patsy) {{enrolled}} at John Handley High School, but never attended classes. Instead, {{to help her}} mother support their family, {{she worked as a}} soda jerk at Gaunt's Drug Store and waitress by day at the Triangle Diner, across the street from John Handley High. After watching performers through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the local radio station, she asked WINC disc jockey and talent coordinator Jimmy McCoy if she could sing on his show. Her performance in 1947 was well received, and she was asked back. This led to appearances at local nightclubs, wearing fringed Western outfits her mother made from Patsy's designs.|$|E
25|$|The narthex is four-columned. Built before 1207, the it {{catered to}} both temples {{at the same}} time. It {{contains}} a door {{which led to the}} communion bread bakery, a small vaulted room. The decoration of the narthex is subordinated to the artistic features of the main temple, which shows especially clearly in ornamental carving. The western portal has, like that of Geghard narthex, a stepped framing which includes the window above. Bas-reliefs are carved on the middle ledge, at the sides of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> <b>At</b> the right side there is a winged sphinx with a crown on its head, and at the left side a lion attacking an ox.|$|E
25|$|During {{her time}} working at Castelli Gallery, Lawler was making paintings, artist’s books, prints, and {{photographs}} of her own. But when she landed her first official gallery exhibition, in 1978 at Artists Space, she did not exhibit any of that work. Instead, she borrowed a small 1883 portrait of a horse from Aqueduct Racetrack — it had been hanging over a Xerox machine in the offices — and mounted it on an empty wall at the gallery. To highlight her appropriation, she installed two spotlights: one above the picture and another pointed out <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>at</b> the building next door, hinting to sidewalk passersby {{that there was something}} of note going on upstairs.|$|E

25|$|In 1378, {{the crafts}} and their leader Wouter van der Leyden {{occupied}} the Leuven city hall and seized the Leuven government. Most of the patricians {{left the city}} and fled to Aarschot. After negotiations were made between the parties, they agreed to share the government. The patricians did not accept this easily, as it caused them to lose their absolute power. In an attempt to regain absolute control, they had Wouter van der Leyden assassinated in Brussels. Seeking revenge, the crafts handed over the patrician to a furious crowd. The crowd stormed the city hall and threw the patricians out of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> <b>At</b> least 15 patricians were killed during this defenestration of Leuven.|$|E
25|$|The video {{begins with}} Pink World's main character, Artemus, shown in his bedroom, looking out <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> a {{helicopter}} that follows him throughout {{the first half}} of the video. He is then shown holding a small globe that is glowing red. His mother enters and puts the globe under his bed and tucks him in. With the helicopter following him, the scene changes to a large institutional setting filled with empty beds. He appears sad and confused as his mother washes him. He sees a vision of crowds of people in the Barrier (foreshadowing the scene in the second part of the video). The first part of the video ends as we see Artemus again looking out of his bedroom window, the institution and the crowds in the Barrier apparently a vision. He climbs back into bed. The plot in the first part of the video is not linear. Scenes are interspersed with flashbacks and future visions.|$|E
25|$|Guests enter {{one of two}} rooms, {{either his}} office or the library, and in each room a large stained glass window depicts a {{confident}} Hightower with Shiriki Utundu sitting on a pedestal nearby. A tour guide talks about Hightower, then winds up an old gramophone that plays a recording of Hightower's last interview. At this point, the lights dim. Suddenly, the stained glass window changes to show a frightened Hightower holding the idol and then entering the elevator on that fateful night. It then shows {{the outside of the}} hotel as the elevator ascends. Suddenly, all the lights in the hotel go out, and there is a flash of green lightning, shattering the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> <b>At</b> this point, Shiriki Utundu comes to life, looks around, laughs mischievously at the guests, and then vanishes into a star-field. A gray fog covers the window, which remains the same when the fog lifts. Guests are then ushered into an enormous storage room where Hightower kept his treasures. There are multiple loading rooms on the second floor, each themed to a different type of item. One has swords, another has tapestries, the third has stone tablets and other valuable artifacts.|$|E

500|$|Alex Browning, {{the last}} role cast, went to Canadian actor Devon Sawa, who {{previously}} {{starred in the}} 1999 film Idle Hands. [...] Sawa said that when [...] " [...] read the script on a plane, [...] found [...] peeking out <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the engine every couple of minutes" [...] and [...] " [...] went down and met Glen and Jim and [...] thought they were amazing and already had some great ideas". However, Morgan and Wong were undecided about casting him for the part, so they requested him to perform again as they reviewed his previous works. Morgan was astounded by Sawa's performance in Idle Hands, and Sawa was hired.|$|E
500|$|The {{windows in}} the north and south walls are set in square frames, and are either two or three lights (sections of window {{separated}} by mullions) decorated with tracery at the top; they date from Kennedy's work in 1868. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the eastern end of the south wall has three lights with tracery, set in a pointed arch frame with a plain hoodmould around it. [...] The two windows at the west end have single lights topped with tracery; the windows at the east end have three lights, tracery and hoodmoulds. Five of the windows, including the main east window, have stained glass by the London artist E. R. Suffling; the east window in the north aisle, by C. A. Gibbs (1849) depicts the Good Samaritan.|$|E
500|$|On 27 June 1914, {{one person}} was killed and 20 were injured in a {{collision}} and subsequent derailment at Cannon Street. A train departing for [...] was in a side-long collision with a train arriving, across its path, from [...] and, although the collision occurred at low speed, part of the Plumstead service was derailed {{and one of its}} carriages overturned. The driver of the Plumstead service was blamed for a failure to observe, and a misreading of, signals which took his train into the path of the Hastings-bound service. An investigation found the man who died was likely leaning out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the moment his carriage overturned, and he might have avoided serious injury had he been seated.|$|E
