40|$|To pick up 3 -D {{aspects of}} {{pictures}} {{is arguably the}} most difficult problem concerning tactile pictorial perception by the blind. The aim of the experiments reported was to examine the potential utility of <b>texture</b> <b>gradients</b> in this context. Since there is no theoretical basis for predicting absolute values of 3 -D properties from 2 -D patterns read by the finger pads, the abilities of participants to perceive gradients lying between known maxima and minima were assessed. Experiment 1 involved blindfolded sighted participants making verbal magnitude estimations of texture-gradient magnitudes corresponding to plane surfaces at different slants. In experiment 2 the participants' task was to orient a surface at a slant corresponding to the <b>texture</b> <b>gradients</b> depicted tactually, and experiment 3 required early-blind participants to attempt the same task. The results revealed that participants can scale the magnitudes of <b>texture</b> <b>gradients</b> with high precision and that they can also accurately produce surface slants from depictions, providing the extreme conditions are clearly defined and there are opportunities for learning. <b>Texture</b> <b>gradients</b> appear as informative to the blind as they do to the sighted. To what extent these data can be generalised to other <b>gradients</b> and <b>textures</b> or to other projections of 3 -D scenes remains to be investigated...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{identify}} two current challenges associated with watershed segmentation algorithms which attempt to fuse the visual cues of texture and intensity. The first challenge {{is that most}} existing techniques use a competing gradient set which does not allow boundaries to be {{defined in terms of}} both visual cues. The second challenge is that these techniques fail to account for the spatial uncertainty inherent in <b>texture</b> <b>gradients.</b> We present a watershed segmentation algorithm which provides a suitable solution to both these challenges and minimises the spatial uncertainty in boundary localisation. This is achieved by a novel fusion algorithm which uses morphological dilation to integrate intensity and <b>texture</b> <b>gradients.</b> Aquantitative and qualitative evaluation of results is provided demonstrating that our algorithm outperforms three existing watershed algorithms...|$|R

50|$|The {{degree of}} texture is often {{subjected}} to an evolution during thin film {{growth and the}} most pronounced textures are only obtained after the layer has achieved a certain thickness. Thin film growers thus require information about the texture profile or the <b>texture</b> <b>gradient</b> in order to optimize the deposition process.

40|$|Texture inhomegeneities {{have been}} found in many {{materials}} (l- 9). Given the significant influence of texture in industrial processes like superplastic forming of complex-shaped components, it is important to study the evolution of <b>texture</b> <b>gradients</b> under different testing conditions, particularly at high strain rates. High strain rates are interesting for superplastic forming, since they enable faster production rates. The study of texture evolution allows, on the other hand, to go deeper into the microscopic mechanisms that occur during plastic deformation. It has been reported, for example, that initial <b>texture</b> <b>gradients</b> disappear when the material is tested superplastically (1). Grain boundary sliding (GBS) is commonly proposed as the microscopic mechanism responsible for superplastic deformation (10,ll). Therefore, grains would rotate independently of each other leading to a randomization of texture. However, the strengthening of certain preferred orientations during superplastic deformation (2) has suggested that GBS-based models are not always adequate to explain superplasticity.

40|$|When people judge height {{from the}} top looking down they tend to {{overestimate}} vertical distance. Initial findings suggest that this perceptual bias may be {{in part due to}} the experienced fear of falling. However, previous studies did not control for potentially relevant optical invariants, especially vertical <b>texture</b> <b>gradient</b> cues, that may inform such perceptual judgments. In this study, we examined to what degree <b>texture</b> <b>gradient</b> cues may account for the perceptual bias in height perception. To this end, in 2 different conditions in which vertical <b>texture</b> <b>gradient</b> cues were either present or absent, participants provided distance and size judgments from an elevated position (5. 68 m) and from the ground. Results revealed a systematic overestimation of vertical extent and object size when judged from a height. Yet, the absence or presence of <b>texture</b> <b>gradient</b> cues did not differentially influence these judgments. Finally, although fear levels were reported to be larger at the elevated position than on the ground, fear levels did not correlate with the perceptual bias, thereby demanding further research into the mechanisms underlying the perceptual bias in height perception. ¬© 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|E

We regard Shape from Texture as a statistical estimation problem, the texture being the realization of a stochastic process. We introduce warplets, which generalize wavelets over the 2 D affine group. At fine scales, the warpogram of the image obeys a transport equation, called <b>Texture</b> <b>Gradient</b> Equation. In order to recover the 3 D shape of the surface, one must estimate the deformation gradient, which measures metric changes in the image. This is made possible by imposing a notion of homogeneity for the original texture, according to which the deformation gradient {{is equal to the}} velocity of the <b>Texture</b> <b>Gradient</b> Equation. By measuring the warplet transform of the image at different scales, we obtain a deformation gradient estimator.

Such texture components are desirable for their potential to improve the formability of aluminium alloys in deep drawing, because they do not transform to the detrimental cube component after recrystallisation. It is however not precisely known how the process parameters affect the texture evolution and the formation of <b>texture</b> <b>gradients.</b> The results of a parametric finite element study of the deformation field and the texture evolution arising during a single pass of asymmetric cold rolling are presented together with an assessment of the impact of <b>texture</b> <b>gradients</b> on the macroscopic anisotropy determined by multi-scale modelling.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the mechanical response of unalloyed Ta and Ta-W alloy annealed plates {{over a wide range}} of loadings. It was observed in general that Ta exhibits nonuniform mechanical behavior, for example, hourglassing of compression samples and multiple instabilities during tensile deformation. In contrast, the Ta-W alloys do not exhibit any unusual nonuniform behavior. This work presents data revealing the spatial distribution of texture in Ta and Ta-W alloys. Significant variations in texture both through the thickness and from one area of the plate to another were found to be characteristic of Ta. The dominant feature of the texture variations was found to be enhanced crystal direction fractions {{at the center of the}} plate, with a decreasing fraction near the surface. We find that the variation in texture in the Ta-W alloys is substantially less than that seen in Ta with primarily a cube texture throughout. This study suggest that the <b>texture</b> <b>gradients</b> are responsible for the nonuniform mechanical response of Ta and that the uniform behavior of the Ta-W alloys is a consequence of the absence of <b>texture</b> <b>gradients...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractGround-planes have an {{important}} influence on the perception of 3 D space (Gibson, 1950) {{and it has been}} shown that the assumption that a ground-plane is present in the scene plays a role in the perception of object distance (Bruno & Cutting, 1988). Here, we investigate whether this influence is exerted at an early stage of processing, to affect the rapid estimation of 3 D size. Participants performed a visual search task in which they searched for a target object that was larger or smaller than distracter objects. Objects were presented against a background that contained either a frontoparallel or slanted 3 D surface, defined by <b>texture</b> <b>gradient</b> cues. We measured the effect on search performance of target location within the scene (near vs. far) and how this was influenced by scene orientation (which, e. g., might be consistent with a ground or ceiling plane, etc.). In addition, we investigated how scene orientation interacted with <b>texture</b> <b>gradient</b> information (indicating surface slant), to determine how these separate cues to scene layout were combined. We found that the difference in target detection performance between targets at the front and rear of the simulated scene was maximal when the scene was consistent with a ground-plane ‚Äì consistent with the use of an elevation cue to object distance. In addition, we found a significant increase in the size of this effect when <b>texture</b> <b>gradient</b> information (indicating surface slant) was present, but no interaction between <b>texture</b> <b>gradient</b> and scene orientation information. We conclude that scene orientation plays {{an important}} role in the estimation of 3 D size at an early stage of processing, and suggest that elevation information is linearly combined with <b>texture</b> <b>gradient</b> information for the rapid estimation of 3 D size...|$|E

This leads to unnatural texture appearance. In addition, <b>texture</b> <b>gradient</b> information is distorted, leading to poor perception of depth. We have developed an efficient algorithm which warps the texture in the texture plane such that the arc length of the texture on the three-dimensional surface is approximately preserved everywhere on the surface. This leads to much more natural texture appearance and preserves <b>texture</b> <b>gradient</b> information. Texture images are preprocessed before the mapping from the texture plane to the three-dimensional surface so no additional run time overhead is incurred compared to conventional two-dimensional texture mapping methods...|$|E

The local spectrum representation is computed by the two-dimensional Wigner distribution, which gives the spatial-frequency information as a function of location. The change in texture density, or the so-called <b>texture</b> <b>gradient,</b> caused by the perspective projection of a surface in the three-dimensional world onto the two-dimensional image plane, is computed from this space-frequency representation by measuring the high-frequency energy distribution at each location of the image.
