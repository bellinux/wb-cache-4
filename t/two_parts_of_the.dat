5|$|Monument 16 and Monument17 are <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same broken {{sculpture}}. This sculpture is classically Olmec {{in style}} and is heavily eroded but represents a human head wearing a headdress {{in the form of}} a secondary face wearing a helmet.|$|E
5|$|A {{wavefront}} splitting interferometer divides a light wavefront {{emerging from}} a point or a narrow slit (i.e. spatially coherent light) and, after allowing the <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wavefront to travel through different paths, allows them to recombine. Fig.5 illustrates Young's interference experiment and Lloyd's mirror. Other examples of wavefront splitting interferometer include the Fresnel biprism, the Billet Bi-Lens, and the Rayleigh interferometer.|$|E
5|$|The first {{rail lines}} in Preston {{were those of}} the Lancaster Canal Tramroad, a horse-drawn line {{connecting}} <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lancaster Canal. It opened in 1805, but never carried passengers and never converted to steam. It ceased operating in Preston in 1862.|$|E

25|$|After World WarII, <b>the</b> {{parameters}} <b>of</b> command responsibility {{were thus}} increased, imposing liability on commanders for {{their failure to}} prevent <b>the</b> commission <b>of</b> crimes by their subordinates. These cases – <b>the</b> latter <b>two</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nürnberg tribunals – discussed explicitly <b>the</b> requisite standard <b>of</b> mens rea, and were unanimous in finding that a lesser level of knowledge than actual knowledge may be sufficient.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the station}} is located on an s-shaped bend in <b>the</b> track, <b>two</b> watchmen, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station staff, are needed.|$|R
5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{consists of}} setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game– for example, {{where to place}} different pieces– while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver. These <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chess-playing process cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics, while the tactical opportunities {{are based on the}} previous strategy of play. A game of chess is normally divided into three phases: opening, typically the first 10 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle; then middlegame; and last the endgame, when most of the pieces are gone, kings typically take a more active part in the struggle, and pawn promotion is often decisive.|$|E
5|$|From 1927 to {{the late}} 1930s, modern NY15 was part of NY2. As a result, all {{of what is now}} NY15A was {{originally}} designated as New York State Route2A as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. <b>Two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> route were sub-standard at the time; however, those sections were rebuilt in the early and mid-1930s. NY2 was supplanted by an extended US15 in April1939, at which time NY2A was renumbered to NY15A to match its parent's new designation.|$|E
5|$|NY78 was {{replaced}} by NY44 (now NY414) {{in the vicinity of}} Watkins Glen as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the same time, <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pre-1921 routing of Route46 east of Seneca Lake were assigned posted route numbers for the first time. From just northeast of Watkins Glen to Reynoldsville, the old road became part of NY227, which initially extended from NY44 (now NY414) near Watkins Glen to NY79 in Perry City. While Route46 veered southeast from Reynoldsville to serve Mecklenburg, NY227 proceeded northeast from the former to connect to Perry City. The portion of old Route46 north of Perry City became part of NY79.|$|E

40|$|Using heat kernel methods {{developed}} by Vaillant, a local index formula is obtained for families <b>of</b> ∂-operators on <b>the</b> Teichmüller universal curve of Riemann surfaces of genus g with n punctures. The formula also holds on the moduli space Mg,n in <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> orbifolds {{where it can}} be written in terms <b>of</b> Mumford-Morita-Miller classes. <b>The</b> degree <b>two</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> formula gives <b>the</b> curvature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corresponding determinant line bundle equipped with the Quillen connection, a result originally obtained by Takhtajan and Zograf...|$|R
5|$|Technical {{difficulties}} {{included the}} very high transistor counts needed to support the wide instruction words and the large caches. There were also structural problems within the project, as the <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> joint team used different methodologies and had slightly different priorities. Since Merced was the first EPIC processor, the development effort encountered more unanticipated problems than the team was accustomed to. In addition, the EPIC concept depends on compiler capabilities {{that had never been}} implemented before, so more research was needed.|$|E
5|$|The Charing Cross Hotel, {{designed}} by Edward Middleton Barry, opened on 15 May 1865 {{and gave the}} station an ornate frontage in the French Renaissance style. It had 250 bedrooms spread over seven floors and extended along Villiers Street {{as well as the}} front of the Strand. The public rooms had balconies overlooking the main station concourse. It quickly became popular and was profitable, leading to a 90-bedroom annexe {{on the other side of}} Villiers Street opening in 1878. A bridge over the street connected the <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hotel together.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} in two parts: sub-surface {{platforms}} opened in 1868 by the Metropolitan Railway and the District Railway {{as part of}} the companies' extension of the Inner Circle route eastwards from Gloucester Road to Westminster and deep level platforms opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway. A variety of underground and main line services have operated over the sub-surface tracks, which have been modified several times to suit operational demands with the current arrangement being achieved in the 1960s. The deep-level platforms have remained largely unaltered, although the installation of escalators in the 1970s to replace lifts improved interchanges between the <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station. Parts of the sub-surface station and the Exhibition Road pedestrian tunnel are Grade II listed.|$|E

50|$|During meals, it was {{forbidden}} for the loggers {{to converse with}} one another, due to it interfering with the cook and cookee's job. One evening, a few newcomers decided to talk during dinner, and continued to talk after the young Jigger politely asked them to stop. One logger started arguing with the boy Jigger, {{and the next thing}} the loggers knew was that the youth had jumped onto the fully grown man and sunk his teeth into his ear. After the other men separated <b>the</b> <b>two,</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> man's ear remained in Jigger's mouth.|$|R
5|$|The {{years from}} 1949 to 1953 are often {{considered}} {{the highlight of}} Vandersteen's career, when he combined large production with consistent high quality in his stories, the jokes, the many characters, and the graphical aspects, in which the charming quirkiness of the early years was balanced with the more rigorous ligne claire of Hergé. Many of these stories were loosely based on popular classics, ranging from Alexandre Dumas over Buffalo Bill to Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, with as culmination his comic in <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legend of Till Eulenspiegel, made for Kuifje.|$|E
5|$|By 1926 Joyce had {{completed}} the first <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine transition. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due {{to a number of}} factors, including {{the death of his father}} in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter Lucia, and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including Samuel Beckett. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend James Stephens to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego, an example of Joyce's superstitions.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Oslo had two stations, {{the larger}} Oslo East Station (or OsloØ, {{located at the}} spot of the current OsloS) and Oslo West Station (OsloV), which served the Drammen Line. This caused a {{physical}} barrier between the <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway network, only connected by the Oslo Port Line which ran partly in city streets. Formal planning of a central station and a tunnel connecting the Drammen Line to OsloØ started in 1938, and the final plans were approved in 1968. The Oslo Tunnel opened on 1 June 1980, and {{made it possible to}} close OsloV in 1989. Nationaltheatret saw a major upgrade in 1999, when it was expanded to four tracks, and from 2008 to 2010, the tunnel will see a major technical upgrade. There are plans to build a second tunnel to increase train capacity west of Oslo.|$|E
