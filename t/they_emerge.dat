5|$|Many of the North American {{species are}} in the genus Neotibicen: the annual or jar fly or dog-day cicadas (so named because <b>they</b> <b>emerge</b> in late July and August). The best-known North American genus, however, is Magicicada. These {{periodical}} cicadas have an extremely long life cycle of 13 or 17 years, suddenly and briefly emerging in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|No {{constituents}} of the body—in the brain or elsewhere—transform into mental states and processes. Such subjective experiences do not {{emerge from the}} body, but neither do <b>they</b> <b>emerge</b> from nothing. Rather, all objective mental appearances arise from the substrate, and all subjective mental states and processes arise from the substrate consciousness.|$|E

5|$|California spiny {{lobsters}} are nocturnal, hiding in crevices during the day, {{with only the}} tips of their long antennae showing, {{as a means of}} avoiding predators. Towards dawn, the {{spiny lobsters}} form aggregations, which they maintain until dusk. At night, <b>they</b> <b>emerge</b> and feed on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. This activity is important in limiting sea urchin populations, and so maintaining healthy seabed communities.|$|E
5|$|For newly emerged {{adults of}} most {{myrmecophilous}} Lycaenidae, deciduous waxy scales provide some protection from predators as <b>they</b> <b>emerge</b> from the nest. In {{the case of}} the moth butterfly (Liphyra brassolis), the caterpillars are unwelcome guests in nests of tree ants, feeding on ant larvae. The adults emerging from pupae are covered with soft, loose adhesive scales which rub off and stick on the ants as they make {{their way out of the}} nest after hatching.|$|E
5|$|Other mammals can be destructive. Possums {{tend not}} to eat {{the leaves of the}} tree, but are very fond of eating the sugar-rich {{flowering}} stalks as <b>they</b> <b>emerge.</b> They also like using the tree as a sleeping place. Rabbits can be more destructive, especially during periods of drought, when they have been seen to eat through the base until a tree falls, and then eating the fallen tree completely. Horses can also fell a tree by eating through the trunk.|$|E

5|$|The {{periodical}} cicadas (Magicicada) {{make use}} of predator satiation: <b>they</b> <b>emerge,</b> all at once, at long intervals of 13 or 17 years; their juveniles are probably the longest-lived of all insect development stages. Since the number of cicadas in any given area exceeds the amount predators can eat, all available predators are satiated, and the remaining cicadas can breed in peace.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic midges (Chironomidae) {{provide the}} highest {{proportion}} of the fly life of the lake. The trout (Salmonidae) will feed at the surface on these and water boatmen (Corixidae), and below the surface on the caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae and pupae; they will also take the adult caddisflies when <b>they</b> <b>emerge.</b> Other aquatic fauna including daphnia and snails are {{also found in the}} lake. Large populations of dragonflies, including migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta) and significant numbers of ruddy darter (Sympetrum sanguineum), occur at the lake. Eleven species of wainscot moth make their home in the reed beds, including the nationally local brown-veined wainscot (Archanara dissoluta), twin-spotted wainscot (Archanara geminipuncta) and silky wainscot (Chilodes maritimus).|$|E
5|$|Broad-headed {{compared}} with other cicadas, the double drummer is mostly brown with a black pattern {{across the back of}} its thorax, and has red-brown and black underparts. The sexes are similar in appearance, though the female lacks the male's tymbals and sac-like covers. Found in sclerophyll forest in Queensland and New South Wales, adult double drummers generally perch high in the branches of large eucalypts. <b>They</b> <b>emerge</b> from the ground where they have spent several years as nymphs from November until March, and live for another four to five weeks. They appear in great numbers in some years, yet are absent in others.|$|E

5|$|The common {{hippopotamus}} inhabits rivers, lakes and mangrove swamps, where territorial bulls preside over {{a stretch of}} river and groups of five to thirty females and young. During the day, they remain cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and childbirth both occur in water. <b>They</b> <b>emerge</b> at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippopotamuses rest near {{each other in the}} water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are not territorial on land. The hippopotamus is a highly aggressive and unpredictable animal and has attacked humans. They are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and ivory canine teeth.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} carotid arteries are {{branches of}} the common carotid arteries. They enter the cranium through the carotid canal, travel through the cavernous sinus and enter the subarachnoid space. They then enter the circle of Willis, with two branches, the anterior cerebral arteries emerging. These branches travel forward and then upward along the longitudinal fissure, and supply the front and midline parts of the brain. One or more small anterior communicating arteries join the two anterior cerebral arteries shortly after <b>they</b> <b>emerge</b> as branches. The internal carotid arteries continue forward as the middle cerebral arteries. They travel sideways along the sphenoid bone of the eye socket, then upwards through the insula cortex, where final branches arise. The middle cerebral arteries send branches along their length.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Mysida are omnivores, feeding on algae, detritus, and zooplankton. Scavenging and cannibalism are also common, with the adults sometimes preying on their young once <b>they</b> <b>emerge</b> from the marsupium. The pelagic {{and most other}} species are filter feeders, creating a feeding current with the exopods of their pereopods. This wafts food particles into a ventral food groove along which they are passed before being filtered by setae (bristles) on the second maxillae. Larger planktonic prey can be caught in a trap composed of the endopods of the thoracic appendages. Some benthic species, especially members of the subfamily Erythropinae, have been observed feeding on small particles which they collected by grooming the surfaces of their bodies and legs.|$|E

5|$|Frogs live on all {{the continents}} except Antarctica, {{but they are not}} present on certain islands, {{especially}} those far away from continental land masses. Many species are isolated in restricted ranges by changes of climate or inhospitable territory, such as stretches of sea, mountain ridges, deserts, forest clearance, road construction, or other man-made barriers. Usually, a greater diversity of frogs occurs in tropical areas than in temperate regions, such as Europe. Some frogs inhabit arid areas, such as deserts, and rely on specific adaptations to survive. Members of the Australian genus Cyclorana bury themselves underground where they create a water-impervious cocoon in which to aestivate during dry periods. Once it rains, <b>they</b> <b>emerge,</b> find a temporary pool, and breed. Egg and tadpole development is very fast in comparison to those of most other frogs, so breeding can be completed before the pond dries up. Some frog species are adapted to a cold environment. The wood frog (Rana sylvatica), whose habitat extends into the Arctic Circle, buries itself in the ground during winter. Although much of its body freezes during this time, it maintains a high concentration of glucose in its vital organs, which protects them from damage.|$|E
5|$|In most species, the nymphs are herbivores or detritivores, {{feeding on}} algae, diatoms or detritus, {{but in a}} few species, they are predators of chironomid and other small insect larvae and nymphs. Nymphs of Povilla burrow into {{submerged}} wood and {{can be a problem}} for boat owners in Asia. Some are able to shift from one feeding group to another as they grow, thus enabling them to utilise a variety of food resources. They process a great quantity of organic matter as nymphs and transfer a lot of phosphates and nitrates to terrestrial environments when <b>they</b> <b>emerge</b> from the water, thus helping to remove pollutants from aqueous systems. Along with caddisfly larvae and gastropod molluscs, the grazing of mayfly nymphs has {{a significant impact on the}} primary producers, the plants and algae, on the bed of streams and rivers.|$|E
5|$|The larva {{is usually}} the {{principal}} feeding stage of the beetle life cycle. Larvae tend to feed voraciously once <b>they</b> <b>emerge</b> from their eggs. Some feed externally on plants, {{such as those of}} certain leaf beetles, while others feed within their food sources. Examples of internal feeders are most Buprestidae and longhorn beetles. The larvae of many beetle families are predatory like the adults (ground beetles, ladybirds, rove beetles). The larval period varies between species, but can be as long as several years. The larvae of skin beetles undergo a degree of reversed development when starved, and later grow back to the previously attained level of maturity. The cycle can be repeated many times (see Biological immortality). Larval morphology is highly varied amongst species, with well-developed and sclerotized heads, distinguishable thoracic and abdominal segments (usually the tenth, though sometimes the eighth or ninth).|$|E

5|$|The register's {{nomination}} gives {{details of}} the paneling and molding throughout the house. Entering through {{the front of the}} house leads to the central hall with a paneled wainscot below the chair rail, forward of the rising stairwell on the left. There is cornice molding and a molded chair rail with runners for the inside shutters. The woodwork in the west front room has a paneled fireplace and is wainscoted below the chair rail. The east rear room is divided in two, with one of the divisions being a bathroom. The upstairs rooms have molded chair rails and cased flair posts. However, the east front room lacks a fireplace while the western one is paneled as the first floor's front west room. The roof of the house is framed by sawn collar beams that were pegged to rafters which were hewn. The chimney stacks are angled so that <b>they</b> <b>emerge</b> symmetrically from the roof.|$|E
5|$|The turn-based ground combat uses a {{top-down}} 3D perspective. The player controls a {{squad of}} between one and six human soldiers or robotic units as they hunt the aliens on the map and attempt to complete other objectives dependent on the mission. Map layouts are not randomly generated, but enemy placement is. Fog of war hides the aliens and their actions from view until the player's soldiers are in range and have line of sight on them, and enemies normally do not act at all until the squad initially comes within line of sight. Soldiers can carry items and perform special abilities; use of these items and abilities is controlled through a toolbar on the head-up display (HUD). A few examples of abilities include firing on enemies automatically after <b>they</b> <b>emerge,</b> launching explosives, and healing allies.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle usually chooses {{tall trees}} or {{man-made}} pylons to nest in. Often, locations are sought {{where there is}} a tall dead tree or high branch with good visibility which {{can be used as a}} perch to survey the surrounding area, which is generally a low-lying locale near water with some forest cover. The perch becomes covered in faeces and pellets and animal remains litter the immediate surrounding area. The nest is a large deep bowl constructed of sticks and branches, and lined with such materials as grass or seaweed. Yearly renovations result in nests getting gradually bigger. Nests are generally sited in the forks of large trees overlooking bodies of water. Old nests of wedge-tailed eagles or whistling kites have been renovated and used. Cliffs are also suitable nesting sites, and on islands nests are sometimes built directly on the ground. A breeding pair, with the male being more active, spends three to six weeks building or renovating the nest before laying eggs. Normally a clutch of two dull, white, oval eggs are laid. Measuring 73×55mm, they are incubated over six weeks before hatching. The young are semi-altricial, and covered in white down when <b>they</b> <b>emerge</b> from the egg. Initially, the male brings food and the female feeds the chicks, but both parents feed the chicks as they grow larger. Although two eggs are laid, it is unusual for two young to be reared successfully to fledging (leaving the nest). One egg may be infertile, or the second chick may die in the nest. If the first clutch is lost, the parents may attempt a second brood. Nestlings have been recorded fledging when 70 to 80 days old, and remaining around the parents' territory for up to six months or until the following breeding season.|$|E
