5|$|According to Thompson, the Navy {{immediately}} began efforts <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{cause of the}} explosion. Rear Admiral Richard Milligan, assigned to lead the investigation, soon focused his inquiry into {{trying to prove that}} one of the deceased turret's crewmembers, Clayton Hartwig, had intentionally caused the explosion. After learning that Hartwig had named another sailor and friend, Kendall Truitt, as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy on himself, Milligan enlisted the help of the Naval Investigative Service (NIS) (the predecessor of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service or NCIS) to investigate Hartwig and Truitt.|$|E

5|$|A second scandal {{occurred}} in 1936 when Blamey attempted {{to cover up}} details of the shooting of the superintendent of the Criminal Investigation Branch, John O'Connell Brophy, whom Blamey had appointed to the post. The story put about was that Brophy had taken two women friends and a chauffeur along with him to a meeting with a police informant. While {{they were waiting for}} the informant, they had been approached by armed bandits, and Brophy had opened fire and had himself been wounded. In order <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> identities of the two women involved, Blamey initially issued a press release to the effect that Brophy had accidentally shot himself (three times). The Premier, Albert Dunstan, gave Blamey the choice of resigning or being dismissed. The latter meant the loss of pension rights and any future prospects of employment in the Public Service or the Army. He reluctantly submitted his resignation on 9 July 1936.|$|E
5|$|After the war Blamey was Deputy Chief of the General Staff, and was {{involved}} {{in the creation of the}} Royal Australian Air Force. He resigned from the regular Army in 1925 to become Chief Commissioner of the Victoria Police, but remained in the Militia, rising to command the 3rd Division in 1931. As chief commissioner, Blamey set about dealing with the grievances that had led to the 1923 Victorian Police strike, and implemented innovations such as police dogs and equipping vehicles with radios. His tenure as chief commissioner was marred by a scandal in which his police badge was found in a brothel, and a later attempt <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> shooting of a police officer led to his forced resignation in 1936. He later made weekly broadcasts on international affairs on Melbourne radio station 3UZ. Appointed chairman of the Commonwealth Government's Manpower Committee and controller general of recruiting in 1938, he headed a successful recruiting campaign which doubled the size of the part-time volunteer Militia.|$|E

5|$|As {{the allies}} began {{to put their}} {{artillery}} into place, the British kept up a steady fire to disrupt them. British fire increased on the 2nd and the allies suffered moderate casualties. General Washington continued to make visits to the front, despite concern shown by several of his officers over the increasing enemy fire. On the night of October 2, the British opened a storm of fire <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> movement of the British cavalry to Gloucester where they were to escort infantrymen on a foraging party. On the 3rd, the foraging party, led by Banastre Tarleton, went out but collided with Lauzun's Legion, and John Mercer's Virginia militia, led by the Marquis de Choisy. The British cavalry quickly retreated back behind their defensive lines, losing 50 men.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} sports, some {{competitors}} in cross-country skiing {{have chosen to}} enhance their performance through doping. Anti-doping tests at the 2001 World Nordic skiing championships in Lahti, Finland revealed that Jari Isometsä, Janne Immonen and two other skiers from Finland's gold-medal relay team, Mika Myllylä and Harri Kirvesniemi, and two female skiers tested positive for hydroxyethyl starch (HES), a blood plasma expander usually used <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> use of erythropoietin (EPO). EPO boosts the oxygen-carrying capability of hemoglobin. In addition, the team head coach left needles and drip bags at a public location near the Helsinki airport. At the Sochi Winter Olympic Games, Austrian cross-country skier Johannes Duerr was ejected from competition after testing positive for the blood booster EPO. In 2007, The International Olympic Committee banned biathletes, Wolfgang Perner and Wolfgang Rottmann, and the cross-country skiers, Martin Tauber, Jürgen Pinter, Johannes Eder, Roland Diethart and Christian Hoffmann, from all future Olympic competition.|$|E
5|$|Corporal Dwayne Hicks (Michael Biehn), Sergeant Apone's second-in-command, {{takes over}} when Apone {{and most of}} the Colonial Marines are {{captured}} by the Aliens and commanding officer Lieutenant Gorman is incapacitated. Hicks looks for options for holding out with the survivors of the Hadley's Hope colony until aid arrives, and he and Ripley bond when he teaches her to use a pulse rifle. He is one of four survivors of the military mission. As the survivors escape, Hicks is injured when a spray of acid blood from an Alien hits his chest and face. He is apparently killed during the crash of the Sulaco in Alien 3, after which a body impaled on a broken support brace is found in his cryochamber. In the video game , Hicks is revealed to be alive and was actually kidnapped by mercenaries working for the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. His body is replaced by an anonymous victim <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> kidnapping, and he is rescued by Colonial Marines.|$|E

30|$|The {{main goal}} of the {{forensic}} investigation {{is to determine the}} cause of death: is death subsequent to the fire or was the deceased a victim of homicide, and the fire setting being simply an arson <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> it <b>up?</b> <b>The</b> cause of death may also be traumatic and the fire a consequence, which is the case in some car accidents.|$|R
50|$|The {{team also}} {{encountered}} {{a case of}} another team accidentally leaking information about a sighting and then trying <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> it <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> iSchools team {{used a variety of}} information sources, including social networks, to determine what the real location was.

As the virus spread, it affected not only humans, but other animals as well, and the environment deteriorated, turning cities into desolate landscapes and the wilderness into wastelands. The real Alice (from whom the clones are made) wanders the wastelands of the Southwestern U.S. She responds to a group asking for help on the radio. It turns out that they are bandits who first attempt to rape her and then have her killed by infected dogs, only for her to unleash them unto her captors. On her travels, she finds a dead man's diary which states that there is an uninfected area in Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Gordon escapes the {{destroyed}} lab. Surviving staff {{tell him}} that communications {{with the outside world}} have been cut and urge him to head to the surface. Gordon fights his way through Black Mesa, defending himself against hostile Xen creatures — such as Vortigaunts and parasitic headcrabs, which attach themselves to human hosts — and US marines sent <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> incident. At the surface, Gordon learns that scientists from the Lambda Complex may have a way to close the portal. Gordon travels {{to the other end of}} the facility to assist them. Along the way, he activates a rocket engine test facility to destroy a giant tentacled creature and uses a disused railway system to reach and launch a satellite rocket. After he is captured by Black Ops and left for dead in a garbage compactor, he escapes and makes his way to an older part of the facility, where he discovers Xen specimens collected before the resonance cascade.|$|E
5|$|In 2072, {{after the}} Citadel Station's demise, TriOptimum's {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> incident {{were exposed to}} the media and the corporation was brought up on charges from multiple individuals and companies for the ensuing scandal. The virus developed there killed the station's population; the ruthless malevolent A.I supercomputer named SHODAN controlled, and eventually destroyed the Citadel Station in hopes of enslaving and destroying humanity. After a massive number of trials, the company went bankrupt and their operations were shut down. The United Nations Nominate (UNN), a UN successor, was established to combat the malevolence and corruption of power-hungry corporations, including TriOptimum. Artificial intelligence was reduced to most rudimentary tasks in order to prevent the creation of another SHODAN-like malevolent AI, and development of new technologies was halted. Meanwhile, the hacker, who became the most famous person in the world, vanished from public eye.|$|E
