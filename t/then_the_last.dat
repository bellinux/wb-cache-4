5|$|The Desmond Crough {{series was}} the first series of {{banknotes}} for Zimbabwe, which carried the signature of Dr. Desmond C. Crough, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> governor of the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia. They are dated 1980 but issued in 1981 (except for the $20 note, which was issued in 1982). The notes bear Salisbury as the name of its capital rather than Harare, as the name was changed on 18 April 1982. There are four denominations in this series: $2, $5, $10 and $20; its designs make extensive use of the Guilloché technique, heavily relied upon by banknotes of many currencies during the 1980s.|$|E

The system has been changed several times since then, and the number of counties has varied over time, from the 71 județe that existed before World War II to only 39 after 1968. The current format has largely been in place since 1968 as only small changes have been made since <b>then,</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> of which was in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The first {{banknotes}} of Zimbabwe {{were issued}} by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (formerly Reserve Bank of Rhodesia) for the first dollar (ZWD) in 1980 {{to coincide with the}} independence of Zimbabwe. These notes replaced the circulating banknotes of the Rhodesian Dollar at par. The first series of banknotes ranged from $2 to $20, and carried the signature of Dr. Desmond Krogh, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> Governor of the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia from 1973. From 1994 to 1997 the Reserve Bank issued a new series of notes ranging from $2 to $100, although the $2 banknote was withdrawn and replaced by a coin in 1997. As rising inflation started to affect the purchasing power of the Zimbabwean Dollar, the $500 and $1000 banknotes were issued from 2001 to 2005 with enhanced anti-counterfeiting measures.|$|E
5|$|In 1226, Duke Konrad I of Masovia {{invited the}} Teutonic Knights {{to help him}} fight the pagan Baltic Prussian people, {{who lived in a}} {{territory}} adjacent to his lands; substantial border warfare was taking place and Konrad's province was suffering from Prussian invasions. On the other hand, the Old Prussians themselves were at that time being subjected to increasingly forced, but largely ineffective Christianization efforts, including Northern Crusades sponsored by the papacy. The Teutonic Order soon overstepped their authority and moved beyond the area granted them by Konrad (Chełmno Land or Kulmerland). In the following decades, they conquered large areas along the Baltic Sea coast and established their own monastic state. As virtually all of the Western Baltic pagans became converted or exterminated (the Prussian conquests were completed by 1283), the Knights confronted Poland and Lithuania, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> pagan state in Europe. Teutonic wars with Poland and Lithuania continued for most of the 14th and 15th centuries. The Teutonic state in Prussia, populated by German settlers beginning in the 13th century, had been claimed as a fief and protected by the popes and Holy Roman Emperors.|$|E

25|$|Through the years, Geoff Downes {{has been}} the most {{consistent}} member of the band, which experienced a revolving roster of noted musicians, particularly in the 1990s; although the most constant member in the band's history, Downes himself was out of the band from its 1989 reunion to 1990. The original, 1981 line-up initially lasted until 1983 when John Wetton left. It was reunited on two occasions: first, one year later when Wetton rejoined, but Steve Howe left before the band could work together again, and a second time in 2006, when Downes, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> original member left, replaced the rest of the band with his original bandmates. This last original reunion lasted until 2013, when Howe left once again. Wetton died from cancer in 2017, making another reunion of the original lineup impossible.|$|E
25|$|For each year, Miller {{wrote about}} ten {{or more of}} his {{favorite}} songs, providing analytical insights and placing the songs in context in the musical world of their era. Miller had kept annual countdown lists of his favorite records throughout his life, and his personal project of compiling those lists onto CDs evolved into a formal endeavor to explain what made those songs noteworthy, for what was <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 50 years of recorded music. The writing process started in 2006, when Miller took a hiatus from music making {{after the release of}} What If It Works?. Portions of the book were serially published in draft form on Miller's official web site, where Miller responded to fan requests by writing about one year at a time, in random order.|$|E

25|$|From 1832 (when {{registers}} of electors {{were first}} prepared) a turnout figure is given, for {{the percentage of}} the registered electors who voted.

If the numbers of registered electors and electors taking part in the poll are known, an exact turnout figure is calculated. In two member bloc vote elections (in which an elector could cast one or two votes as he chose), where the exact number of electors participating is unknown, an estimated turnout figure is given. This is calculated by dividing the total number of votes cast by two. To the extent that electors used only one of their votes the estimated turnout figure is an underestimate.|$|E

He waited around the Washington Street entrance for three-quarters of an hour, but he never saw his friend Kreamer emerge from the stairway, nor did he ever see him again.|$|E
