5|$|<b>Thought</b> <b>processes</b> are noncommutative: A person asked a {{question}} (A) and then {{a question}} (B) may give different answers to each question than a person asked first (B) and then (A), because asking a question may change the person's state of mind.|$|E
5000|$|In Csikszentmihalyi's five-step {{process to}} elicit {{creative}} thinking, incubation {{is a necessary}} step. Meaning, the use of unconscious thought is needed to solve complex problems. A problem such as 2+2 is a linear <b>thought</b> <b>process</b> that can performed in the consciousness. Trying to solve the equation for gravity requires more complex connections in the brain which has been seen to require the unconscious <b>thought</b> <b>process.</b> In application to education, this may include requiring more recess time to facilitate the creative <b>thought</b> <b>process.</b> However, there is limited research on how exactly the creative <b>thought</b> <b>process</b> works {{and how it can}} be elicited.|$|R

5|$|Miller's career started {{during the}} reign of behaviorism in psychology. Behaviorists {{questioned}} whether mental <b>thought</b> <b>processes</b> were fit for scientific study, not being observable. They focused on working with responses to stimuli, particularly among other animals. Miller disagreed. He, Jerome Bruner, and Noam Chomsky are considered the founders of the field of Cognitive Psychology that replaced behaviorism as the framework for analyzing the mind.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{symptoms}} are deficits of normal emotional responses or of other <b>thought</b> <b>processes,</b> {{and are less}} responsive to medication. They commonly include flat expressions or little emotion, poverty of speech, inability to experience pleasure, lack of desire to form relationships, and lack of motivation. Negative symptoms appear to contribute more to poor quality of life, functional ability, and the burden on others than positive symptoms do. People with greater negative symptoms often {{have a history of}} poor adjustment before the onset of illness, and response to medication is often limited.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} refers to {{issues at the}} theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and <b>thought</b> <b>processes?</b> If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases {{in which there is}} no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a Likert scale, they may be experiencing very different things.|$|E

5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of thought. Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of <b>thought</b> <b>processes</b> is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E

He also directed Kafka's Rêves.|$|E

25|$|The {{argument}} {{hinges on}} the idea that a satisfactory naturalistic account of <b>thought</b> <b>processes</b> in terms of brain processes can be given for mathematical reasoning along with everything else. One line of defense is to maintain that this is false, so that mathematical reasoning uses some special intuition that involves contact with the Platonic realm. A modern form of this argument is given by Sir Roger Penrose.|$|E

Everything requires attention, really. If we ran machines without paying attention to them, they would break down. Our thought, too, is a process, and it requires attention, otherwise it's going to go wrong.|$|R
