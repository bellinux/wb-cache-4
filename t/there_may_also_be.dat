5|$|Fish {{reproductive}} organs include testicles and ovaries. In most species, gonads are paired organs of similar size, {{which can be}} partially or totally fused. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> a range of secondary organs that increase reproductive fitness.|$|E
5|$|Clatworthy Reservoir is an {{important}} wildlife habitat managed by Wessex Water, and offers facilities for fishing and walking. The river and its tributaries support populations of European water vole (Arvicola amphibius). <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> populations of white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes) and northern crested newts (Triturus cristatus). The fish species in the river include: chub, carp, grayling, roach, tench, rudd, perch and pike.|$|E
5|$|Tail lift or ramp – Ambulances can {{be fitted}} with a tail lift or ramp in order to {{facilitate}} loading a patient without having to undertake any lifting. This is especially important where the patient is obese or specialty care transports that require large, bulky equipment such as a neonatal incubator or hospital beds. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> equipment linked to this such as winches which are designed to pull heavy patients into the vehicle.|$|E

5|$|Visual {{differentiation}} {{from the}} fish crow (C. ossifragus) {{is extremely difficult}} and often inaccurate. Nonetheless, differences apart from size do exist. Fish crows {{tend to have more}} slender bills and feet. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> a small sharp hook {{at the end of the}} upper bill. Fish crows also appear as if they have shorter legs when walking. More dramatically, when calling, fish crows tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathers.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{going through}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis {{on the path}} to becoming alates form a subcaste in certain species of termite, functioning as potential supplementary reproductives. These supplementary reproductives only mature into primary reproductives upon the death of a king or queen, or when the primary reproductives are separated from the colony. Supplementaries have the ability to replace a dead primary reproductive, and <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> more than a single supplementary within a colony. Some queens have the ability to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual reproduction. Studies show that while termite queens mate with the king to produce colony workers, the queens reproduce their replacements (neotenic queens) parthenogenetically.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars have short {{antennae}} {{and several}} simple eyes. The mouthparts are adapted for chewing with powerful mandibles {{and a pair}} maxillae, each with a segmented palp. Adjoining these is the labium-hypopharynx which houses a tubular spinneret which is able to extrude silk. Butterfly caterpillars have three pairs of true legs on the thoracic segments and up to six pairs of prolegs arising from the abdominal segments. These prolegs have rings of tiny hooks called crochets that are engaged hydrostatically and help the caterpillar grip the substrate. The epidermis bears tufts of setae, the position and number of which help in identifying the species. There is also decoration {{in the form of}} hairs, wart-like protuberances, horn-like protuberances and spines. Internally, most of the body cavity is taken up by the gut, but <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> large silk glands, and special glands which secrete distasteful or toxic substances. The developing wings are present in later stage instars and the gonads start development in the egg stage.|$|E

5|$|In some people, {{the disease}} {{proceeds}} to a critical phase as fever resolves. During this period, there is {{leakage of plasma}} from the blood vessels, typically lasting one to two days. This may result in fluid accumulation {{in the chest and}} abdominal cavity as well as depletion of fluid from the circulation and decreased blood supply to vital organs. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> organ dysfunction and severe bleeding, typically from the gastrointestinal tract. Shock (dengue shock syndrome) and hemorrhage (dengue hemorrhagic fever) occur in less than 5% of all cases of dengue, however those who have previously been infected with other serotypes of dengue virus ("secondary infection") are at an increased risk. This critical phase, while rare, occurs relatively more commonly in children and young adults.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand's native Cordyline {{species are}} relics of {{an influx of}} {{tropical}} plants that arrived from the north 15 million {{years ago in the}} warm Miocene era. Because it has evolved in response to the local climate, geology and other factors, C.australis varies in appearance from place to place. This variation can alter the overall appearance of the tree, canopy shape and branch size, the relative shape and size of the leaves, and their colour and stiffness. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> invisible adaptations for resistance to disease or insect attack. Some of these regional provenances are different enough to have been named by North Island Māori: Tītī in the north, tī manu in the central uplands, tarariki in the east and wharanui in the west.|$|E
5|$|The {{youth leader}} of the troop is the senior patrol leader (SPL), elected by the Scouts in the troop. He is {{responsible}} for the overall performance of the troop, runs troop meetings and ensures that the program for troop meetings and other activities is carried out. He is advised by the Scoutmaster. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> one or more assistant senior patrol leaders. Each patrol elects a patrol leader who then appoints an assistant patrol leader and other positions within the patrol. Together, the senior patrol leader, assistant senior patrol leader and patrol leaders make up the patrol leaders council (PLC), the group of Scouts that is responsible for developing the troop's program with the advice of the Scoutmaster.|$|E

5|$|There are {{multiple}} scenarios for known risks {{that can have}} a global impact on the planet. From the perspective of humanity, these can be subdivided into survivable risks and terminal risks. Risks that humanity pose to itself include climate change, the misuse of nanotechnology, a nuclear holocaust, warfare with a programmed superintelligence, a genetically engineered disease, or a disaster caused by a physics experiment. Similarly, several natural events may pose a doomsday threat, including a highly virulent disease, the impact of an asteroid or comet, runaway greenhouse effect, and resource depletion. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> {{the possibility of an}} infestation by an extraterrestrial lifeform. The actual odds of these scenarios are difficult if not impossible to deduce.|$|E
5|$|Metazoans are {{multicellular}} organism, {{different groups}} of cells of which have separate functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, {{both of which are}} present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms, sponges and some cephalopods. Exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). Calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs, brachiopods and some tube-building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria. Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians (polyps, sea anemones, jellyfish) and the collagenous cuticle of annelids. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> protrusions such as microvilli, cilia, bristles, spines and tubercles.|$|E
5|$|The {{newly created}} xylem is the sapwood. It is {{composed}} of water-conducting cells and associated cells which are often living, and is usually pale in colour. It transports water and minerals from the roots to the upper parts of the tree. The oldest, inner part of the sapwood is progressively converted into heartwood as new sapwood is formed at the cambium. The conductive cells of the heartwood are blocked in some species, and the surrounding cells are more often dead. Heartwood is usually darker in colour than the sapwood. It is the dense central core of the trunk giving it rigidity. Three quarters of the dry mass of the xylem is cellulose, a polysaccharide, {{and most of the}} remainder is lignin, a complex polymer. A transverse section through a tree trunk or a horizontal core will show concentric circles or lighter or darker wood - tree rings. These rings are the annual growth rings <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> rays running at right angles to growth rings. These are vascular rays which are thin sheets of living tissue permeating the wood. Many older trees may become hollow but may still stand upright for many years.|$|E

5|$|The two dorsal fins are {{of nearly}} equal size and placed far {{back on the}} body, with the first {{originating}} over the latter third of the pelvic fin bases and the second over {{the latter half of}} the anal fin base. The pectoral and pelvic fins are broad and rounded; the males have stout claspers. The pelvic and anal fins are about as large as the dorsal fins. The broad caudal fin comprises about a fifth of the total body length and has a strong notch near the tip of the upper lobe and an indistinct lower lobe. The skin is thick and covered by well-calcified arrowhead-shaped dermal denticles. The coloration of the dark shyshark is highly variable, and particular individuals can resemble any of the other shyshark species. The background color ranges from light brown to reddish to grayish to almost black above, transitioning abruptly to white or cream below, sometimes with dark blotches beneath the paired fins. There may be 68 orange, brown, or blackish variably shaped saddles along the back and tail, edged more or less obviously in black. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> white spots within or within and between the saddles.|$|E
