5|$|<b>The</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement</b> has {{influenced}} and informed {{the feminist movement}} and vice versa. Many Western feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights {{and the rights of}} non-white people. Despite the connections between the women's and civil rights movements, some tension arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with race issues. Similarly, some women argued that <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement</b> had sexist elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns. These criticisms created new feminist social theories about the intersections of racism, classism, and sexism, and new feminisms, such as black feminism and Chicana feminism.|$|E

5|$|Homophile organizations—as {{homosexual}} {{groups were}} called—grew {{in number and}} spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. Frank Kameny founded the Mattachine of Washington, D.C. He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at mental health professionals, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal. In 1965, Kameny, inspired by <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Movement,</b> organized a picket of the White House and other government buildings to protest employment discrimination. The pickets shocked many gay people, and upset some of the leadership of Mattachine and the DOB. At the same time, demonstrations in <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Movement</b> and opposition to the Vietnam War all grew in prominence, frequency, and severity throughout the 1960s, as did their confrontations with police forces.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} Nation of Islam, MalcolmX {{announced}} {{his willingness to}} work with leaders of <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement,</b> though he advocated some changes to their policies. He felt that calling the movement a struggle for civil rights would keep the issue within the United States, while changing the focus to human rights would make it an international concern. The movement could then bring its complaints before the United Nations, where MalcolmX said the emerging {{nations of the world}} would add their support.|$|E
5|$|Brodie {{believed}} that previous historians had unduly vilified Stevens, and she enjoyed {{the prospect of}} rebuilding a reputation rather than, as in her Joseph Smith biography, tearing one down. Stevens {{as a champion of}} black people was a timely interest as <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Movement</b> increased in intensity. Research materials were available at Yale University, where Bernard Brodie was employed. Fawn Brodie wondered how Stevens had been affected psychologically by his physical deformity, a club foot.|$|E
