5|$|Emus are diurnal {{birds and}} spend their day foraging, {{preening}} their plumage with their beak, dust bathing and resting. They are generally gregarious birds {{apart from the}} breeding season, and while some forage, others remain vigilant to their mutual benefit. They are able to swim when necessary, although they rarely do so unless the area is flooded or they need <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>a</b> river.|$|E

A French steamship, the Louisiane, went ashore with 600passengers; all people aboard the vessel were rescued by the Forward, a Revenue cutter.|$|E
5|$|A graphic {{description}} of the nuckelavee as it appears on land was given by an islander {{who claimed to have}} had a confrontation with it, but accounts describing the details of the creature's appearance are inconsistent. In common with many other sea monsters it is unable to tolerate fresh water, therefore those it is pursuing have only <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>a</b> river or stream to be rid of it. The nuckelavee is kept in confinement during the summer months by the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient Orcadian spirit, and the only one able to control it.|$|E

5|$|After his training, Rane {{was posted}} to the 28th Field Company, an {{engineering}} {{unit of the}} 26th Infantry Division which, at the time, was fighting the Japanese in Burma. As his division retreated from the Japanese after the failed Arakan Campaign, he, along with his two sections, was hand-picked by his company commander to stay back behind at Buthidaung to destroy key assets and then be evacuated by the Royal Indian Navy. Though the objective was soon achieved, the expected pickup did not happen. This forced Rane and his men <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>a</b> river that was patrolled by the Japanese to reach their lines. Rane, along with his two sections, expertly evaded the Japanese troops, and joined the 26th Infantry Division at Bahri. For his actions, {{he was promoted to}} havaldar (sergeant).|$|E
5|$|At 1200, Mott {{was brought}} to the {{position}} of L Company commander Captain George F. Sharra. Mott ordered Sharra to take command and organize a retreat. Sharra ordered his three platoons to withdraw. A battalion of North Korean soldiers began moving down the pass towards the American positions. Men of I Company were forced to withdraw through rice paddies south of the pass, being strafed by mortar and machine gun fire in the process. They also had <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>a</b> -wide stream in the retreat, and some drowned in the process. Most of the Americans were forced to discard weapons, equipment and clothing in the retreat. Many of the men of L Company, {{as well as some of}} the wounded, were able to evacuate by truck.|$|E

5|$|Five people drowned {{after their}} cars were {{swept away by}} floodwaters while trying <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>a</b> flooded stream. The floods also damaged 4,000-6,000 homes and {{buildings}} and significantly disrupted water and communications {{for an extended period}} of time. The hurricane's storm surge damaged many boats and yachts in ports along the peninsula's coast, most of them beyond repair. Minor beach erosion was reported at San Felipe, Baja California. As a result, the Baja California Sur municipalities of La Paz, Los Cabos, Loreto, Comondú, and Mulegé were declared national disaster areas. 6,000 people were affected and total damage from the storm was $100 million.|$|E
5|$|Five {{people were}} killed due to the {{hurricane}} on the peninsula, including a 62-year-old man who died in Santa Rosalia, who perished when trying <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>a</b> river, a man who {{died of a heart}} attack in La Paz, and a South Korean mining executive whose car was swept away due to flooding. Overall, more than 11,000people were evacuated from their homes due to flooding. At least 135people were injured. Total damage from Odile amounted to approximately MX$16.6billion (US$1.22billion), with most of the damage coming from the infrastructural and agricultural sectors of the economy.|$|E
5|$|M-142 begins just a {{few miles}} south of Bay Port at an {{intersection}} with M-25 near the Bay Port Cemetery, about two-thirds of a mile (1.1km) inland from Saginaw Bay. From there, the road travels eastward through farm country on Pigeon Road. The highway follows a direct course over the Pigeon River to the village of Pigeon, when M-142 turns south on Main Street to exit town. South of town, the Pigeon Road name resumes, and after about , M-142 turns back eastward near the Grand Lawn Cemetery. The road then continues eastward through more farms to Elkton, diverting off a direct course <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>a</b> line of the Huron and Eastern Railway {{on the east side of}} town.|$|E
40|$|We analyze how the {{expected}} packet delay in rooted tree networks {{is affected by}} the distribution of time needed for <b>a</b> packet <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>an</b> edge using stochastic comparison methods. Our result generalizes previously known results that the delay when the crossing time is exponentially distributed yields an upper bound for {{the expected}} delay when the crossing time is constant on this class of of networks. Unlike previous work, we do not assume Poisson arrivals. Our result also extends to a variety of service distributions, and {{it can be used to}} bound the expected value of all convex, increasing functions of the packet delays. An interesting corollary of our work is that in rooted tree networks, if one can change the distribution of the time <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>an</b> edge while keeping the expectation fixed, the strategy that minimizes the expected delay and the expected maximum delay is to make the time <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>an</b> edge constant. Our result also holds in mulitcasting rooted tree networks, where a single [...] ...|$|R

5|$|On October 18, Sharon's {{division}} {{across the}} canal included the 243rd Paratrooper Brigade under Colonel Danny Matt and an armored brigade under Colonel Haim Erez. Sharon, wanting {{to expand the}} Israeli bridgehead northward, received permission <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>a</b> third unit, an armored brigade under Colonel Amnon Reshef, to the west bank, and did so on October 19. The paratroopers {{and part of the}} armor had been holding the Israeli bridgehead since October 16, facing little resistance, while Reshef's brigade had been involved in heavy fighting at the Chinese Farm until it was relieved by Israeli reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Rough seas {{offshore}} Odisha caused two fishing trawlers to collide, {{resulting in}} 18fatalities, while two additional trawlers were reported missing. In West Bengal, the storm uprooted trees and dropped heavy rainfall. Throughout India, 124deaths were confirmed.

One death was reported in Bangladesh after a man attempted <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>a</b> swollen river. Overall, there were 49fatalities in Bangladesh. The storm was attributed to at least 173fatalities in India, Bangladesh, and offshore areas.|$|E
5|$|Several islands {{within the}} Solomon Islands {{reported}} extensive property and crop damage. Within Vanautu, Anne brought heavy rains, flooding, and a storm surge. These effects damaged houses, crops, and property, especially on Ureparapara islands and the Torres Islands. Extensive damage {{was reported in}} New Caledonia after it was exposed to a prolonged period of storm force winds, with the eastern and southern coasts particularly affected. On January12, the system produced the highest daily rainfall totals since 1951 in several areas. Two people were killed after they attempted <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>a</b> flooded river, and about 80others were injured by the cyclone. Due {{to the impact of}} this storm, the name Anne was retired.|$|E
