5|$|Flock {{behaviour}} in sheep {{is generally}} only exhibited {{in groups of}} four or more sheep; fewer sheep may not react as expected when alone or with few other sheep. Being a prey species, the primary defense mechanism of sheep is to flee from danger when their flight zone is entered. Cornered sheep may charge and butt, or threaten by hoof stamping and adopting an aggressive posture. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> for ewes with newborn lambs.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} a long-held {{assumption}} {{that the majority of}} stars occur in gravitationally bound, multiple-star systems. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> for very massive O and B class stars, where 80% of the stars are believed to be part of multiple-star systems. The proportion of single star systems increases with decreasing star mass, so that only 25% of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions. As 85% of all stars are red dwarfs, most stars in the Milky Way are likely single from birth.|$|E
5|$|Carménère {{favors a}} long growing season in {{moderate}} to warm climates. During harvest {{time and the}} winter period the vine fares poorly if it is introduced {{to high levels of}} rain or irrigation water. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> in poor-soil plantings where the vine would need more water. Over-watering during this period accentuates the herbaceous and green pepper characteristics of the grape. The grape naturally develops high levels of sugar before the tannins achieve ripeness. If grown in too hot a climate the resulting wine will have a high alcohol level and low balance. Carménère buds and flowers three to seven days later than Merlot and the yield is lower than that of the latter grape. The Carménère leaves turn to crimson before dropping.|$|E

50|$|Early Gospel {{music in}} Uganda was modeled mainly after praise and worship music practiced by church choirs and bands. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> for the pentecostal/Born Again movement, locally {{referred}} to as Balokole.|$|R
5|$|Indian {{agriculture}} is {{heavily dependent on}} the monsoon {{as a source of}} water. In some parts of India, the failure of the monsoons results in water shortages, resulting in below-average crop yields. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> of major drought-prone regions such as southern and eastern Maharashtra, northern Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Western Orissa, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. In the past, droughts have periodically led to major Indian famines. These include the Bengal famine of 1770, in which up to one third of the population in affected areas died; the 1876–1877 famine, in which over five million people died; the 1899 famine, in which over 4.5 million died; and the Bengal famine of 1943, in which over five million died from starvation and famine-related illnesses.|$|E
5|$|Women with anti-TPO {{antibodies}} who {{are trying}} to become pregnant (naturally or by assisted means) may require thyroid hormone supplementation even if the TSH level is normal. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> if they have had previous miscarriages or have been hypothyroid in the past. Supplementary levothyroxine may reduce the risk of preterm birth and possibly miscarriage. The recommendation is stronger in pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as TSH 2.5–10mIU/l) who are anti-TPO positive, in view of the risk of overt hypothyroidism. If a decision is made not to treat, close monitoring of the thyroid function (every 4 weeks in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy) is recommended. If anti-TPO is not positive, treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism is not currently recommended. It has been suggested that many of the aforementioned recommendations could lead to unnecessary treatment, {{in the sense that the}} TSH cutoff levels may be too restrictive in some ethnic groups; there may be little benefit from treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in certain cases.|$|E
5|$|The role of {{wildfire}} is {{an important}} one for plant and animal species diversity. Many tree species have evolved to mainly germinate after a wildfire. Regions of the park that have experienced wildfire in historical times have greater species diversity after reestablishment than those regions that have not been influenced by fire. Though the Yellowstone fires of 1988 had minimal impact on Grand Teton National Park, studies conducted before and reaffirmed after that event concluded than the suppression of natural wildfires during the middle part of the 20th century decreased plant species diversity and natural regeneration of plant communities. One study conducted 15 years before the 1988 Yellowstone National Park fires concluded that human suppression of wildfire had adversely impacted Aspen tree groves and other forest types. The majority of conifer species in Grand Teton National Park are heavily dependent on wildfire and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> of the Lodgepole Pine. Though extremely hot canopy or crown fires tend to kill Lodgepole Pine seeds, lower severity surface fires usually result in a higher post wildfire regeneration of this species. In accordance with {{a better understanding of the}} role wildfire plays in the environment, the National Park Service and other land management agencies have developed Fire Management Plans which provide a strategy for wildfire management and are expected to best enhance the natural ecosystem.|$|E
50|$|In 19th century United States forested areas, {{cash was}} often {{hard to come}} by. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> in lumber camps, where workers were {{commonly}} paid in company-issued scrip rather than government issued currency.|$|R
50|$|Practitioners {{frequently}} attributed many ailments, {{as well as}} most odd behaviors, {{now recognized}} as mental diseases to Satan and other demons. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> when the ravings, actions, or hallucinatory experiences could be considered blasphemous or heretical.|$|R
5|$|Some {{of those}} who had {{initially}} remained in the ruins of the city after the uprising later made attempts to leave. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> of Robinsons who had stayed, not of their own choice, but due to unfavorable circumstances.|$|R
5|$|Abelisaurids, {{especially}} Majungasaurus, may instead {{have been}} adapted for a feeding strategy {{more similar to}} modern felids, with short and broad snouts, that bite once and hold on until the prey is subdued. Majungasaurus had an even broader snout than other abelisaurids, {{and other aspects of}} its anatomy may also support the bite-and-hold hypothesis. The neck was strengthened, with robust vertebrae, interlocking ribs and ossified tendons, as well as reinforced muscle attachment sites on the vertebrae and the back of the skull. These muscles {{would have been able to}} hold the head steady despite the struggles of its prey. Abelisaurid skulls were also strengthened in many areas by bone mineralized out of the skin, creating the characteristic rough texture of the bones. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> of Majungasaurus, where the nasal bones were fused and thickened for strength. On the other hand, the lower jaw of Majungasaurus sported a large fenestra (opening) on each side, as seen in other ceratosaurs, as well as synovial joints between certain bones that allowed a high degree of flexibility in the lower jaw, although not to the extent seen in snakes. This may have been an adaptation to prevent the fracture of the lower jaw when holding onto a struggling prey animal. The front teeth of the upper jaw were more robust than the rest, to provide an anchor point for the bite, while the low crown height of Majungasaurus teeth prevented them from breaking off during a struggle. Finally, unlike the teeth of Allosaurus and most other theropods, which were curved on both the front and back, abelisaurids like Majungasaurus had teeth curved on the front edge but straighter on the back (cutting) edge. This structure may have served to prevent slicing, and instead holding the teeth in place when biting.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> for the marmoset. Recent {{research}} shows most marmosets are chimeras, sharing DNA with their fraternal twins. 95% of marmoset fraternal twins trade blood through chorionic fusions, making them hematopoietic chimeras.|$|E
5000|$|The TRC {{found that}} the use of torture by MK was [...] "routine", as were executions [...] "without due process" [...] at ANC {{detention}} camps. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> in the period of 1979-1989, although torture was not official ANC policy.|$|R
50|$|The Wratislaw name is {{continually}} {{intertwined with the}} development of Rugby into the town that it <b>is</b> today. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> of Count Wratislaw, who formed the Rugby Gas Company which provided street lighting for Rugby, a major development for the town.|$|R
30|$|In {{almost two}} thirds of the institutions, {{innovative}} teaching was perceived as {{one of the benefits of}} online learning. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> for very large institutions (more than 30, 000 students).

25|$|Most {{children}} will outgrow their reflux {{by their first}} birthday. However, a small but significant number of them will not outgrow the condition. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> when {{a family history of}} GERD is present.|$|E
25|$|For {{crossover}} operators which exchange contiguous {{sections of}} the chromosomes (e.g. k-point) the ordering of the variables may become important. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> when good solutions contain which might be disrupted by a non-respectful crossover operator.|$|E
25|$|Duala {{is used as}} a trade languages, due {{largely to}} the spread of the tongue by early missionaries. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> among the {{neighbouring}} Wovea, many of whom speak Duala in lieu of their native tongue, and the Isubu, many of whom are bilingual in Duala.|$|E
50|$|Nigeria had {{issues with}} {{qualifying}} a bigger team for Rio {{because of a}} lack of funding available to its elite sportspeople. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> for table tennis, one of the three sports Nigeria competed in at Rio.

25|$|Seventh-day Adventists {{have often}} focused on those doctrines which are {{distinctive}} to Adventism. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> {{in the early}} days of the movement, when it was assumed that most people the church witnessed to were already Christian to begin with, and that they already understood the gospel.|$|R
50|$|While many of {{the prizes}} on the {{original}} Price Is Right were normal, standard game show fare (e.g., furniture, appliances, home electronics, furs, trips, and cars), there were many instances of outlandish prizes being offered. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> of the nighttime version, which had a larger prize budget.|$|R
25|$|As the solids flow {{along the}} Grijalva, they are {{constricted}} by the narrow channel {{of the canyon}} {{and then by the}} presence of the Chicoasén Dam. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> at a point called “El Tapón” (The Plug), where two currents of water meet just before the reservoir back up of water from the Dam.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the 19th and 20th centuries, in {{accordance}} with their increasingly modern societies and outlooks, liberal Muslims have tended to reinterpret many aspects of the application of their religion in their life in an attempt to reconnect. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> of Muslims who now find themselves living in non-Muslim countries.|$|E
25|$|The melting {{points of}} {{branched-chain}} alkanes {{can be either}} higher or {{lower than those of}} the corresponding straight-chain alkanes, again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase: <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> for isoalkanes (2-methyl isomers), which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues.|$|E
50|$|As {{the above}} shows, the {{sketches}} would often belabour the point somewhat. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> {{in later years}} when Graeme Garden and Barry Cryer invented the characters of Hamish and Dougal, two rural Scotsmen who featured regularly in the sketches, and later were given their own series, You'll Have Had Your Tea.|$|R
30|$|The {{major benefit}} of online {{learning}} perceived by responders {{was that it}} results in greater access and more flexibility for students, although almost three-quarters of those responding also saw online learning {{as a means to}} increase enrolments. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> for institutions in the Atlantic provinces which are suffering an overall decline in population.|$|R
50|$|After {{the end of}} the war in September 1945, most of the {{temporary}} training bases were put on inactive status and eventually closed. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> for bases like Williams that had sprung up overnight and were built with temporary wooden structures.

25|$|The Dozenal Society of America {{argues that}} factors of 3 are more {{commonly}} encountered in real-life division problems than factors of 5. Thus, in practical applications, the nuisance of repeating decimals is encountered less often when duodecimal notation is used. Advocates of duodecimal systems argue that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> of financial calculations, {{in which the}} twelve {{months of the year}} often enter into calculations.|$|E
25|$|The {{value and}} {{utility of the}} WFC rests also in the {{opportunity}} it offers to the world foresters and sectoral decisions-makers to analyse and expose their technical convictions and experiences, to discuss and exchange ideas and thinking, and to broaden their perspectives by sharing their common as well as diverse problems. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> today, as forestry development {{is becoming more and}} more a topic with international linkages and implications.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{football}} helmet {{is such a}} significant and visible part of {{the football}} uniform, some teams also wore alternate helmets when wearing their third jersey. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> <b>true</b> for throwback uniforms, such as those worn by the Steelers (yellow), Jets/Titans (yellow), and Buccaneers (white).
