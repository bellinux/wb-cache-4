A way of summarizing this method is by the application of Occam's razor, which suggests that the simpler solution is usually the correct one. The standard scientific models give the explanation that what appears to be paranormal phenomena is usually a misinterpretation, misunderstanding, or anomalous variation of natural phenomena, rather than an actual paranormal phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|Menduh Zavalani {{was one of}} {{the four}} {{appointed}} delegates from Korça to the Albanian National Congress that proclaimed the Independence of Albania on 28 November 1912. Nevertheless, the Ottoman officials of Korça prevented the telegram messages from reaching the Albanian nationalist leaders, as well as their messages being sent away. Menduh and his compatriots Mihal Grameno, Stavro Karoli and Estref Vërleni learned too late of the independence Assembly and reached Vlorë only five days later. Instead, <b>taking</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> Korça was under siege, they were substituted during {{the first day of the}} Assembly by Pandeli Cale, Thanas Floqi and Spiridon Ilo.

25|$|He {{also notes}} that koinophilia {{provides}} no explanation {{as to how the}} physiological, anatomical and genetic causes of reproductive isolation come about. It is only the behavioral reproductive isolation that is addressed by koinophilia. It is furthermore difficult to see how koinophilia might apply to plants, and certain marine creatures that discharge their gametes into the environment to meet up and fuse, it seems, entirely randomly (within conspecific confines). However, when pollen from several compatible donors is used to pollinate stigmata, the donors typically do not sire equal numbers of seeds. Marshall and Diggle state that the existence of some kind of non-random seed paternity is, in fact, not in question in flowering plants. It is how this occurs that remains unknown. Pollen choice is one of the possibilities, <b>taking</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> 50% of the pollen grain’s haploid genome is expressed during its tube’s growth towards the ovule.|$|E

25|$|Consistent with Catherine's stance, {{the next}} several decades marked a shift of public {{perception}} against the death penalty. In 1824, {{the very existence of}} such a punishment was among the reasons for legislature's refusal to approve {{a new version of the}} Penal Code. Just one year later, the Decembrist revolt failed, and a court sentenced 36 of the rebels to death. Nicholas I's decision to commute all but five of the sentences was highly unusual for the time, especially <b>taking</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> revolts against the monarchy had almost universally resulted in an automatic death sentence, and was perhaps due to society's changing views of the death penalty. By the late 1890s, capital punishment for murder was virtually never carried out, but substituted with 10 to 15 years imprisonment with hard labor, although it still was carried out for treason (for example, Alexander Ulyanov was hanged in 1887). However, in 1910, capital punishment was reintroduced and expanded, although still very seldom used.|$|E
25|$|With {{the arrival}} of the mobile battery from Queluz, the pieces were {{arranged}} in the palace gardens so that they could bombard the quarters of the revolutionary sailors, which were located at no more than 100 metres from the palace. However, before they had time to start, the commander of the battery received the order to cancel the bombing and join the forces that were leaving the palace, integrated into the column that would attack the rebels in Artillery 1 and the Rotunda. At around midday the cruisers Adamastor and São Rafael, which had anchored in front of the sailors' quarters an hour previously, started the bombardment of the Palace of Necessidades, an action which served to demoralise the present monarchical forces. The king took refuge in a small house in the palace's park, where he could ring Teixeira de Sousa, since the revolutionaries had only cut the special state telephone lines and not the general network. The king ordered the prime minister to send the battery from Queluz to the palace to impede the debarkation of the sailors, but the prime minister replied that the main action was happening in Rotunda and all the troops that were there were needed. <b>Taking</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> the available troops were not sufficient to defeat the rebels in Rotunda, the minister made it obvious to the king that it would be more convenient to retire to Sintra or Mafra so that the stationed forces of the palace could reinforce the troops in Rotunda.|$|E

Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic, <b>taking</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> the album has a different appeal, was somewhat positive in his review.
