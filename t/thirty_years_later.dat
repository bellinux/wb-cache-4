5|$|A {{little more}} than <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>later,</b> in August 1964, {{paleontologist}} John Ostrom led an expedition from Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History which discovered more skeletal material near Bridger. Expeditions during the following two summers uncovered more than 1,000 bones, among which were at least three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making {{the exact number of}} individual animals represented impossible to determine properly, the type specimen (YPM 5205) of Deinonychus was restricted to the complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at Yale's Peabody Museum although they could have been from as few as three individuals.|$|E
5|$|George's {{marriage}} to Sophia Dorothea was dissolved, {{not on the}} grounds that either of them had committed adultery, but {{on the grounds that}} Sophia Dorothea had abandoned her husband. With the agreement of her father, George had Sophia Dorothea imprisoned in Ahlden House in her native Celle, where she stayed until she died more than <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>later.</b> She was denied access to her children and father, forbidden to remarry and only allowed to walk unaccompanied within the mansion courtyard. She was, however, endowed with an income, establishment, and servants, and was allowed to ride in a carriage outside her castle, albeit under supervision. Melusine von der Schulenburg acted as George's hostess openly from 1698 until his death, and they had three daughters together, born in 1692, 1693 and 1701, respectively.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} from his unsuccessful mission to Japan, Nuyts {{took up his}} position as the third Governor of Formosa, with his residence in Fort Zeelandia in Tayouan (modern-day Anping). One of his early aims was to force an opening for the Dutch to trade in China — something which had eluded them since they arrived in East Asia in the early 17th century. To further this goal, he took the Chinese trade negotiator Zheng Zhilong hostage and refused to release him until he agreed to give the Dutch trading privileges.

5|$|Pyrrhus' {{defeat in}} the Peloponnese led to the {{diminution}} of Epirus' power {{and the loss of}} its Macedonian and Thessalian conquests. Antigonus capitalised on his Peloponnesian victory to wrest back control of Macedonia and become the preeminent power in Greece. The establishment of Macedonian dominance led to a breakdown of the Spartan-Macedonian alliance. In a bid to further his own royal ambitions, Areus had Sparta join a coalition of Greek poleis and fought Macedon in the Chremonidean War. The war ended in a crushing Spartan defeat with Antigonus defeating and killing his former ally Areus in a battle on the Isthmus of Corinth in 265 BC. The defeat was so disastrous for Sparta that they would not rise to be a regional power until the reign of Cleomenes III <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>later.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Flag of His Country is a 1910 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company.

The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|A {{period of}} {{rebuilding}} and remodelling {{occurred in the}} late Middle Ages. A chantry chapel, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was founded in 1271 by the merchants Thomas Blount and John de Bucham, who endowed it with lands around Old and New Sleaford, and several surrounding villages. The chapel {{is located on the}} north aisle, and the chaplain was instructed to pray there for the founders at his daily mass. The chantry priest's house is recorded in the 1440s as one of the oldest buildings in Sleaford; located in the churchyard, it became the Vicarage. The tower was probably accompanied by a nave of a similar date, which was rebuilt in the Decorated Gothic style in the mid to late 14th century; the transept followed twenty or <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>later,</b> according to Trollope. A clerestory was added in around 1430 and the chancel was remodelled at this time.|$|E

5|$|Antigonus {{emerged from}} the {{conflict}} as the unchallenged ruler of Macedon and the leading power in Greece. After his victory in Argos, Antigonus was able to install his supporter Aristippos as tyrant {{of the city and}} appointed various pro-Macedonian leaders as tyrants in other Greek cities. His support for tyrants over democratic rulers would lead to growing resentment amongst the Greek cities against Macedon. On his journey north to Macedon, Antigonus succeeded in placing garrisons in the cities of Chalcis and Eretria on the important island of Euboia with the outcome being that he further consolidated his power in Greece. The Spartan-Macedon alliance proved to be transient. Angered by Macedon's supremacy and full of ambition, Areus formed a coalition with several Greek poleis, most notably Athens. In the resulting Chremonidean War, Areus was slain by his former ally Antigonus in a battle on the Isthmus of Corinth in 265 BC. The war ended in a defeat that was so crushing for Sparta that it would not rise as a regional power again until the reign of Cleomenes III <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>later.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gaza was rebuilt by Roman General Pompey Magnus, {{and granted}} to Herod the Great <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>later.</b> Throughout the Roman period, Gaza {{maintained}} its prosperity, receiving grants from several different emperors. A 500-member senate governed the city, {{which had a}} diverse population of Greeks, Romans, Jews, Egyptians, Persians and Nabateans. Conversion to Christianity in the city was spearheaded and completed under Saint Porphyrius, who destroyed its eight pagan temples between 396 and 420 CE. Gaza was conquered by the Muslim general Amr ibn al-'As in 637 CE, and most Gazans adopted Islam during early Muslim rule. Thereafter, the city went through periods of prosperity and decline. The Crusaders wrested control of Gaza from the Fatimids in 1100, but were driven out by Saladin. Gaza was in Mamluk hands by the late 13th century, and became the capital of a province that stretched from the Sinai Peninsula to Caesarea. It witnessed a golden age under the Ottoman-appointed Ridwan dynasty in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Monet's use {{of colored}} shadows arose from color {{theories}} that were {{popular in the}} 19th century. German scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (17491832) published {{one of the first}} modern descriptions of colored shadows in his Theory of Colours (1810). Goethe attempted to challenge the theory of color propounded by Isaac Newton (16431727) in his treatise on Opticks (1704). Goethe raised questions about subjective and objective color theory and perception, but his intuitive, non-mathematical approach was criticized as unscientific, and his attack on Newton was dismissed as a polemic. The questions Goethe raised about color persisted. <b>Thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>later,</b> French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul (17861889) expanded on Goethe's theory with The Principles of Harmony and Contrast of Colors (1839). Goethe and Chevreul's colour theory greatly influenced the art world. It is generally thought that Vincent van Gogh, Camille Pissarro and Monet incorporated elements of these theories into their work. Georges Seurat (18591891) came to prominence in 1886 with his technique of chromatic division, a style influenced by the color scheme theories of Chevreul and American physicist Ogden Rood (18311902).|$|E
