5|$|Stylistically, it is {{characterized}} by its innovative syntax and the frequent paratactic use of multiple subjects, objects, and verbs in a single sentence without conjunctions or punctuation to separate them. Structurally, it consists of nine books that, because of the immense time span, often do not share common characters or settings; the third-person narrative voice, which has been likened to that of an anonymous chronicler, does not pass judgment on the events or provide commentary <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>help</b> tie events together.|$|E
5|$|Though {{similar in}} their {{formation}} process, oil shales differ from coals in several distinct ways. The precursors {{of the organic}} matter in oil shale and coal differ {{in a sense that}} oil shale is of algal origin, but may also include remains of vascular land plants that more commonly compose much of the organic matter in coal. The origin of some of the organic matter in oil shale is obscure {{because of the lack of}} recognizable biologic structures <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>help</b> identify the precursor organisms. Such materials may be of bacterial origin or the product of bacterial degradation of algae or other organic matter.|$|E

5|$|With {{the help}} of an {{artificial}} leg, Fox was walking three weeks after the amputation. He then progressed to playing golf with his father. Doctors were impressed with Fox's positive outlook, stating it contributed to his rapid recovery. He endured sixteen months of chemotherapy and found the time he spent in the British Columbia Cancer Control Agency facility difficult as he watched fellow cancer patients suffer and die from the disease. Fox ended his treatment with new purpose: he felt he owed his survival to medical advances and wished to live his life in a way <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>help</b> others find courage.|$|E
5|$|After {{breaking}} {{out from his}} prison, Brad falls into a moat before coming {{to a halt in}} a maze of an underground cavern. Reaching the surface, he arrives at a nearby village; this location is repeatedly revisited throughout the game, as Brad comes back there after traveling to the various corners of the land, encountering bizarre characters and experiencing absurd adventures: the Edge of the World cliff, the Ice Palace, and the Valley of the Lost (a place where all kinds of things lost on Earth have gone to), all while searching for an unlikely set of items <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>help</b> him emerge victorious from the game's final showdown (including a fire extinguisher and a mechanical fan). In the end, the boy enters the evil Queen's castle to find and defeat her once and for all. Once she is no more, he gets instantly transported back to the baseball field where it all had started.|$|E
5|$|During the Vietnam War era, {{the corps}} {{supervised}} {{the training and}} deployment of more than 137 units and detachments to Southeast Asia, including the I and II Field Force staffs. The corps also trained more than 40,000 individual replacements for units in Vietnam, {{for a total of}} over 100,000 soldiers trained. As the war in Southeast Asia ended, the corps received many units and individual soldiers for reassignment or inactivation. It was also during this period that III Corps units participated in a number of key tests and evaluations <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>help</b> determine Army organization and equipment for the next 30 years. During this era, the corps also received its distinctive unit insignia.|$|E

5|$|Some {{critics have}} seen Swift as hopeless {{in regards to}} actual change for Ireland. The rich could never change from their {{absentee}} landlord mentality that has stripped Ireland of its economic independence, {{and that is why}} Swift spends the majority of his sermon discussing the poor. Swift proposes a remedy of sorts <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>help</b> the poor; they should be educated and the free travel of beggars should be restricted. These ideas were intended to limit the amount that the poor consumed in society, which, combined with a proposal for the poor to act more virtuously, should correct many of the problems that plague Ireland, but these ideas were never put into effect.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson wrote Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in 1885 when he {{was living}} in Bournemouth, on England's south coast. In January 1886 the novella was {{published}} in the United Kingdom by Longmans, Green & Co. and by Charles Scribner's Sons in the United States, where it was frequently pirated {{because of the lack of}} copyright protection in the U.S. for works originally published in the UK. In early 1887, actor Richard Mansfield read Stevenson's novella and immediately got the idea to adapt it for the stage. Mansfield was looking for material <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>help</b> him achieve a reputation as a serious actor in the U.S., where he lived, and in England, where he had spent most of his childhood. He had played dual roles as a father and son in a New York production of the operetta Rip Van Winkle, and saw another acting opportunity in playing Jekyll and Hyde.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{motorway}} was constructed, the A6 {{road through}} Preston handled north-south traffic with tailbacks and congestion a common occurrence, more so during special occasions {{such as the}} Blackpool Illuminations. The route had been planned {{as far back as}} 1937â€“1938, with the basic alignment still deemed feasible by the time Lancashire County Council gave approval in the mid 1940s. Chief engineer Drake was part of a delegation from Lancashire that travelled to Germany in 1938 in order that a plan could be drawn up by the council. The agreed route formed part of the County Surveyors' Society's national proposals and was protected by Lancashire County Council from any future developments. During planning, the legal powers necessary for motorway construction did not exist, until the introduction of the Special Roads Act in 1949 that made it lawful to construct roads that were to be used only by certain classes of vehicle. The by-pass was seen as an experiment for the future motorway construction, with many lessons and techniques were learned <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>help</b> towards successful future projects. When the proposals were made public, including a large-scale model to ease the explaining of the scheme, only a handful of formal objections were raised and were resolved by agreement without the need to initiate a public inquiry, cited in part because of close personal involvement of Lancashire County Council and the surveyor during consultation.|$|E

5|$|M sends Bond to {{investigate}} Carver after he releases news {{articles about the}} crisis hours before MI6 had learned of it. Bond travels to Hamburg and seduces Carver's wife, Paris, who is also Bond's ex-girlfriend, to get information <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>help</b> him enter Carver's newspaper headquarters. He also knocks out three of Stamper's men and cuts Carver off the air while he is giving a speech during the inaugural broadcast of his satellite network. After Bond steals back the GPS encoder, Carver orders Paris and Bond killed. Paris is murdered by Carver's personal assassin Dr. Kaufman, but Bond kills Kaufman and escapes, protecting the encoder. Bond learns that the encoder had been tampered with, {{and goes to the}} South China Sea {{to investigate}} the wreck (which was actually in Vietnamese waters). He and Wai Lin, a Chinese agent on the same case, explore the sunken ship and discover one of its cruise missiles missing, but are captured by Stamper and taken to the CMGN tower in Saigon. They soon escape and decide to collaborate on the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of livermorium {{has not yet been}} established. In 2011, experiments were conducted to create nihonium, flerovium, and moscovium isotopes in the reactions between calcium-48 projectiles and targets of americium-243 and plutonium-244. The targets included lead and bismuth impurities and hence some isotopes of bismuth and polonium were generated in nucleon transfer reactions. This, while an unforeseen complication, could give information <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>help</b> in the future chemical investigation of the heavier homologs of bismuth and polonium, which are respectively moscovium and livermorium. The produced nuclides bismuth-213 and polonium-212m were transported as the hydrides 213BiH3 and 212mPoH2 at 850Â°C through a quartz wool filter unit held with tantalum, showing that these hydrides were surprisingly thermally stable, although their heavier congeners McH3 and LvH2 would be expected to be less thermally stable from simple extrapolation of periodic trends in the p-block. Further calculations on the stability and electronic structure of BiH3, McH3, PoH2, and LvH2 are needed before chemical investigations take place. Moscovium and livermorium are expected to be volatile enough as pure elements for them to be chemically investigated in the near future, a property livermorium would then share with its lighter congener polonium. Though no known isotopes of livermorium have long enough half-lives, 288Mc, 289Mc, and 290Mc may be chemically investigated with current methods.|$|E
