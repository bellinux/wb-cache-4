60|$|She {{had reached}} her room now, {{and as she}} sat upon <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> of ferns and grasses, with one hand resting upon her rising and falling bosom, she felt the hard {{outlines}} of the man's locket.|$|E
6000|$|She sat on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> {{and looked}} about her, at her room, at {{the row of}} black-covered books and the pig's skull. [...] "I must take them," [...] she said, to help herself over her own incredulity. [...] "How shall I get my luggage out of the house?..." ...|$|E
60|$|One {{night when}} Margaret {{had gone up}} to her room, I put on a light overcoat, {{went out into the}} night and prowled for a long time through the narrow streets, smoking and thinking. I {{returned}} and went and sat on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> to talk to her.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Lapham stood {{flapping}} the cheque {{which she}} held {{in her right}} hand against <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> left.|$|R
6000|$|She stood negligently, staring {{away from}} him, into the distance. On <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{consciousness}} <b>the</b> question was asking itself, automatically: ...|$|R
60|$|One {{morning the}} empress sat on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband's bed, {{and began to}} coax him {{with all sorts of}} pretty ways.|$|R
60|$|She {{took refuge}} in beating her pillow and inventing {{insulting}} epithets for herself. She got up, drew up her blind, and stared out of window at a dawn-cold vision of chimneys for a time, and then went and sat on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed.</b> What was the alternative to going home? No alternative appeared in that darkness.|$|E
60|$|May did not answer. With {{her face}} hid {{in her hands}} she sat on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed,</b> weeping {{at the thought of}} her lover's fallen condition. Poor May! People said that telegraphic work was too hard for her, because her cheeks were losing the fresh bloom that she had brought from the west of Ireland, and the fingers with which she {{manipulated}} the keys so deftly were growing very thin. But sorrow {{had more to do with}} the change than the telegraph had.|$|E
60|$|Instantly all the indignations {{which had}} been {{dominating}} him and the spiritual dramas through which he had struggled became pallid and absurd before the ancient and overwhelming realities, the standard and traditional realities, of sickness and menacing death, the long night, and the thousand steadfast implications of married life. He crept back to her. As she drowsed away in the tropic languor of morphia, he sat on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed,</b> holding her hand, {{and for the first}} time in many weeks her hand abode trustfully in his.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Bowen fingered <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> book. [...] "You mustn't {{let your}} fancy {{run away with}} you, Imogene," [...] she said, with a little painful smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "Running it for you," [...] said Mrs. Price, {{with a quick}} eye-shot {{from under}} <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lashes. [...] "Man alive! What are you {{thinking}} of?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, maister, {{there was}} a little one upon <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> plate when I brought it out; and so it must have been in <b>her</b> few leaves <b>of</b> wintergreen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's the matter?" [...] He {{sat down}} on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> and began to stroke her hair. For a long time she did not answer, {{and he went on}} {{stroking}} her hair mechanically, almost unconsciously; sometimes, even he bent down and kissed her bare shoulder. He had his own affairs, however, to think about. What had happened? How was it that the stupid gossip had actually come true? Emily had died of arsenic poisoning. It was absurd, impossible. The order of things had been broken, and he was at the mercy of an irresponsibility. What had happened, what was going to happen? He was interrupted {{in the midst of his}} thoughts.|$|E
6000|$|With a shrug {{she turned}} away and shut the door. She sat down on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed,</b> very still. In that little passage of wits she had won, she could win in many such; but the full hideousness of things had come to her. Lies! lies! That was to be her life! That; or to say {{farewell}} to all she now cared for, to cause despair not only in herself, but in her lover, and--for what? In order that her body might remain {{at the disposal of}} that man in the next room--her spirit having flown from him for ever. Such were the alternatives, unless those words: [...] "Then come to me," [...] were to be more than words. Were they? Could they be? They would mean such happiness if--if his love for her were more than a summer love? And hers for him? Was it--were they--more than summer loves? How know? And, without knowing, how give such pain to everyone? How break a vow she had thought herself quite above breaking? How make such a desperate departure from all the traditions and beliefs in which she had been brought up! But in the very nature of passion is that which resents the intrusion of hard and fast decisions.... And suddenly she thought: If our love cannot stay what it is, and if I cannot yet go to him for always, is there not still another way? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The place {{does look}} a bit wet, now I come to notice it," [...] says Providence, peeping down over <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> star. [...] "Better turn on the fine weather, I suppose." ...|$|R
60|$|His voice, though sunk {{now almost}} to a whisper, was {{vibrating}} with passion. He half dropped on his knees, took <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> skirt between his fingers and raised it to his lips.|$|R
50|$|The Queen woke when he {{disturbed}} a curtain, {{and initial}} reports said Fagan sat on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed.</b> But in a 2012 interview, {{he said she}} left the room immediately to seek security. She had phoned the palace switchboard twice for police but none had arrived. Fagan then asked for some cigarettes, which were brought by a maid, who had been cleaning a neighbouring room. The duty footman, Paul Whybrew, who had been walking the Queen's dogs, then appeared, followed by two policemen on palace duty who removed Fagan. The incident had happened as the armed police officer outside the royal bedroom came off duty before his replacement arrived.|$|E
5000|$|In his 1975 autobiography, Tennessee Williams: Memoirs, {{the writer}} told {{of his time}} (1941) as a night shift {{elevator}} operator at the old San Jacinto Hotel in Manhattan. Among the hotel’s guest {{at the time was}} Witherspoon who, according to Williams, would employ him or the hotel’s telephone operator, a budding poet, to pick up her morphine prescription from an all-night pharmacy. She used to rap with me and the poet till nearly day break in the San Jacinto lobby. Her “fix” would never wear itself out till first cock’s crow. Then the poet and I would sort of lift her into the lift, the poet would open her bedroom door and I would get her to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> and let her drop on it.”What would I do without you boys?” she’d murmured with that sweet sad wisdom of the old who knows “all will pass.” Tennessee Williams, 1975 ...|$|E
50|$|When Vijay goes {{to fetch}} his lover Holly to help analyse the {{readings}} from the array, {{he finds the}} ghost of James, her dead lover, sitting at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed.</b> James’ image dissolves into a fountain of light which nearly consumes Holly before Vijay manages to snap her fully awake. Meanwhile, the old folks’ bus crashes on {{its way out of}} town when the driver falls victim to the same force that prevented Lowcock and Yeadon from leaving. Tim Medway, the BBC reporter coming to interview Trevithick, feels no such influence when he enters the town, and when he comes across the accident he helps Jill to evacuate the stunned old folk to the monastery. Medway stops at the police station to report the accident, only to find them fully occupied by the disappearance of so many townspeople. He continues on to the pub, where Trevithick fills him in on the unbelievable events and decides to alert the Doctor, who seemed to believe his story. Medway, unable to accept what he's stumbled into, nevertheless agrees to drive Trevithick to the radiotelescope to look for the Doctor.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile Cleopatra had risen, and, having {{thrown back}} the gnat gauze, was seated upon <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> couch, her eyes fixed upon my face, while her fingers played with her girdle's jewelled ends.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{want to hear}} it--I don't want to hear it!" [...] {{she said}} through her hands, as he, {{standing}} close to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> gown, began to allude to the Jersey days.|$|R
6000|$|... "Neighbors, do {{you hear}} what that lazy {{creature}} down there is saying?" [...] cried a swallow, peeping over <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> nest, and addressing several others who sat on a beam near by.|$|R
40|$|Three {{photos of}} Carolyn Weathers {{lounging}} {{on the bed}} of her apartment at her fifth floor apartment 1825 North Kingsley Avenue, looking provocatively at the camera, or rather, at Jenny Wrenn, who was taking the pictures.

6000|$|... "She can't last long," [...] {{continued}} Allardyce, in his measured way. [...] "She may put {{her nose}} down and her tail up any minute. The water's lipping up to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> rail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's a {{tremendous}} large dinner-party at the House to-night,' said Emmeline methodically, {{looking at the}} equipage over <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> teacup, without leaving off sipping. 'That was Lord Mountclere. He's a wicked old man, they say.' ...|$|R
60|$|And he fell on {{his knees}} before her, as she backed against the bookcase, and he caught hold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress-bottom, drawing it to him. Which made her rather abashed, and much more uncomfortable.|$|R
50|$|After a pursuit in the air—the {{opening scene}} of the film—Dagny's plane crashes in a valley hidden by stealth technology. A wounded Dagny Taggart crawls to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> crashed plane, where she is greeted by John Galt.|$|R
6000|$|... "By {{acting in}} unison,--by solving the most perplexing problem in women's practising your profession. She passed <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fan over her lips before letting it fall furled upon her left hand, and looked luminously into Grace's eyes.|$|R
25|$|On July 28, 2015, a giraffe calf named Kipenzi {{died when}} she broke her neck after accidentally running into <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> herd's enclosure. Kipenzi was born into fame after her birth was {{broadcast}} and streamed live on Animal Planet.|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile {{the mother}} dove sat on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> nest, crying bitterly, when a heron, who was flying slowly past the rock, {{was filled with}} pity for her, and stopped to ask, 'What is the matter, you poor dove?' ...|$|R
60|$|Anna {{glanced at}} the strange youth again. She felt him waiting there for her to notice him. He was {{hovering}} on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> consciousness, ready to come in. She {{did not want to}} look at him. She was antagonistic to him.|$|R
60|$|Erickson put {{the things}} {{back in the}} sample case. He was smiling, but his face had gone chalk white. Mara stared down, playing with a drop <b>of</b> water on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> glass. Jan clenched his hands {{together}} nervously, blinking rapidly.|$|R
6000|$|He {{stretched}} {{himself at}} full length at her feet, extravagant {{now in his}} acts and gestures {{like a man who}} no longer can hold turbulent passion in check. He kissed <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> kirtle, then her cloak and the tips <b>of</b> <b>her</b> little shoes: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are weeping at the pathos of the air. Come here, and I will comfort you," [...] said Caroline, in a pitying accent. Mrs. Pryor came. She {{sat down}} on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> patient's bed, and allowed the wasted arms to {{encircle}} her.|$|R
