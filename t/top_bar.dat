30|$|In {{common design}} practice, the beam {{reinforcement}} ratio A_s,bot /A_s,top usually ranges between 0.5 and 1.0. If the top reinforcement area (A_s,top) exceeds the bottom reinforcement area (A_s,bot) at a beam-column joint, relatively larger flexural compression would be {{developed at the}} bottom beam ends in order to balance the greater flexural tension developed from the <b>top</b> beam <b>bars</b> at the same section. Thus, the compressive stress of the bottom beam bars at the joint face would be {{greater than that of}} the <b>top</b> beam <b>bars</b> at the opposite face. In other words, the stress gradient along the bottom bars is larger than that along the <b>top</b> <b>bars</b> in the joint, indicating a relatively severe bond demand for the bottom bars.|$|R

2500|$|Above {{the grid}} is a {{distance}} bar scale, notched with sub-units. There are {{two sets of}} numbers on the scale, one for measuring each grid square by 20 miles, another for measuring each grid square by 100 miles (see diagram). [...] The <b>top</b> <b>bar</b> is the 20m-per-square scale, with every black dot denoting one mile. [...] The bottom bar is the 100m-per-square scale, where {{the length of a}} unit square is divided into two equal 50m sub-squares, and a set of dots and red lines break it down further into lengths of 10 miles. [...] So depending on which scale one chooses, the length of the side of the entire grid (eight squares) could be measured up to 160 miles (using the 20m-per-square scale) or up to 800 miles (using the 100m-per-square scale).|$|E
2500|$|In his apiary, Dzierzon {{studied the}} social life of honeybees and {{constructed}} several experimental beehives. In 1838 he devised the first practical movable-comb beehive, which allowed manipulation of individual honeycombs without destroying {{the structure of}} the hive. The correct distance between combs had been described as 1½ inches from the center of one <b>top</b> <b>bar</b> {{to the center of the}} next one. In 1848 Dzierzon introduced grooves into the hive’s side walls, replacing the strips of wood for moving top bars. The grooves were 8×8mm—the exact average between ¼ and ⅜ inch, which is the range called the [...] "bee space." [...] His design quickly gained popularity in Europe and North America. On the basis of the aforementioned measurements, [...] (May 1852) in Thuringia and L.L. Langstroth (October 1852) in the United States designed their frame-movable hives.|$|E

At Triplemanía II-B, Juventud Guerrera, his father Fuerza Guerrera and Misterioso defeated Rey Misterio Jr., his uncle Rey Misterio and Volador in their first major show encounter. On November 30, 1994 Rey Misterio Jr. defeated Juventud Guerrera to win the WWA World Lightweight Championship on an AAA show in Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Three months later, on February 2, 1995 Rey Misterio and Rey Misterio Jr. successfully defended the WWA World Tag Team Championship against Fuerza and Juventud Guerrera. A month later the Guerreras would win the WWA Tag Team Championship when Juventud Guerrera pinned Rey Misterio Jr. By pinning Misterio Jr. Juventud Guerrera also regained the WWA World Lightweight Championship. On June 16, 1995 Rey Misterio Jr. regained the WWA World Lightweight Championship. On January 31, 1996 both Rey Misterio Jr. and Juventud Guerrera would place their personal cars on the line in a steel cage match, but during the match both wrestlers ended up stumbling {{off the top of the}} cage, landing on the <b>top</b> <b>bar</b> of the cage, unable to continue the match which was declared a draw.
