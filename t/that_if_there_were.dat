Both a fourth and a fifth film were planned {{and at one}} time the idea of shooting the two sequels concurrently was under consideration. However, Raimi stated in March 2009 that only the fourth film was in development {{at that time and}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> fifth and sixth films, those two films would actually be a continuation of each other. James Vanderbilt was hired in October 2007 to pen the screenplay after initial reports in early 2007 that Sony Pictures was in contact with David Koepp, who wrote the first Spider-Man film. The script was subsequently rewritten by Pulitzer-winning playwright David Lindsay-Abaire in November 2008 and rewritten again by Gary Ross in October 2009. Sony also engaged Vanderbilt to write scripts for Spider-Man 5 and Spider-Man 6.|$|E

5|$|The {{first set}} of {{relatives}} that had claim to an epikleros were the paternal uncles and any heirs of the uncles. Next in line were any sons of the sisters {{of the father and}} any of their heirs. Third in line were the grandsons of the father's paternal uncles, and following them the grandsons of the paternal aunts of the father. After these paternal relatives were exhausted, then the half-brothers of the father by the same mother were in line, then sons of the maternal half-sisters of the father. Seventh in line were the grandsons of maternal uncles of the father and then grandsons of maternal aunts of the father. It appears <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> two or more relatives that were related in the same degree, the eldest of the similarly-related relatives had priority in claiming the epikleros.|$|E

5|$|The MAUD {{reports were}} {{reviewed}} by the Defence Services Panel of the Scientific Advisory Committee. This was chaired by Lord Hankey, with its other members being Sir Edward Appleton, Sir Henry Dale, Alfred Egerton, Archibald Hill and Edward Mellanby. The panel held seven meetings in September 1941, and submitted its report to the Lord President of the Council, Sir John Anderson. At this point it was feared that German scientists were attempting to provide their country with an atomic bomb, and thus Britain needed to finish its first. The report ultimately stated <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> even a sliver of a chance that the bomb effort could produce a weapon with such power, then every effort {{should be made to}} make sure Britain did not fall behind. It recommended that while a pilot separation plant be built in Britain, the production facility should be built in Canada. The Defence Services Panel submitted its report on 24 September 1941, but by this time the final decision had already been taken. Lord Cherwell had taken the matter to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, who became the first national leader to approve a nuclear weapons programme on 30 August 1941. The Chiefs of Staff Committee supported the decision.|$|E

25|$|Furious {{with the}} {{authorities}} in Richmond, Governor Rector threatened to withdraw Arkansas from the Confederacy. Governor Rector issued an address on May 5, 1862 calling {{for the formation of}} 30 new infantry companies and 20 new cavalry companies. Rector indicated <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> insufficient volunteers to fill these new companies, a draft would be made upon the militia regiments and brigades. As a further enticement, Rector also indicated that these regiments were for home defense and {{that they would not be}} transferred to Confederate Service without their consent.|$|E
25|$|In 1305, {{the newly}} elected Pope Clement V asked {{the leaders of the}} {{military}} orders for their opinions concerning a new crusade and the merging of their orders. Molay was asked to write memoranda on each of the issues, which he did during the summer of 1306. Molay was opposed to the merger, believing instead that having separate military orders was a stronger position, as the missions of each order were somewhat different. He was also of the belief <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> to be a new crusade, it needed to be a large one, as the smaller attempts were not effective.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{thereafter}} {{the local}} sheriff and local residents {{arrived at the}} scene of the crash. The thrust from the still-idling jet engine allowed the aircraft to slowly drift on its belly along a field. The sheriff, having contacted the air base, was informed that he should simply allow the jet to run out of fuel, which occurred an hour and forty-five minutes later without further incident. A recovery crew from McClellan Air Force Base arrived on the scene and began to dismantle the aircraft, removing its wings for transport aboard a railroad flat car. The damage to the aircraft was minimal; indeed, one officer on the recovery crew is reported to have stated <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> any less damage he would have simply flown the aircraft out of the field.|$|E

500|$|After the segment, a Twitterbot named [...] "DeepDrumpf" [...] {{was created}} at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Named after the Last Week Tonight segment, the bot uses neural network {{technology}} to post tweets in {{an imitation of}} Trump. The bot's creator stated that DeepDrumpf collects fragments of Trump's statements, noting their grammatical structure using artificial intelligence (AI), and outputs the resulting sentences based on what it learned about Trump's grammar style. He also said <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> more data available, or even all the data that Facebook's AI system can analyze, then the neural network would {{be better able to}} mimic Trump.|$|E
500|$|Captain America's shield, {{which serves}} as both a {{defensive}} tool and a weapon, came in four types: metal, fiberglass, rubber, and computer graphics (CG). Prop master Barry Gibbs specified that [...] "We had the 'hero shield,' which was made of aluminum, for our beauty shots [...] close-up work. We then created a lighter shield that was aluminum-faced with a fiberglass back, for use on a daily basis.... And then we had a stunt shield made of polyurethane, {{which is sort of}} a synthetic rubber... and we made an ultrasoft one we put on [...] back, so <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> an accident, it wouldn't hurt him." [...] Visual effects supervisor Christopher Townsend said Evans [...] "would practice swinging the practical shield so he knew the arc and the speed at which he should move. We would take the shield from him and shoot the scene with him miming it. Then we would add in a CG shield".|$|E
500|$|The writer David Kimbell {{states that}} in Luisa Miller and Stiffelio (the {{earliest}} operas of this period) {{there appears to}} be a [...] "growing freedom in the large scale structure...and an acute attention to fine detail." [...] Others echo those feelings. Julian Budden expresses the impact of Rigoletto and its place in Verdi's output as follows: [...] "Just after 1850 at the age of 38, Verdi closed the door on a period of Italian opera with Rigoletto. The so-called ottocento in music is finished. Verdi will continue to draw on certain of its forms for the next few operas, but in a totally new spirit." [...] One example of Verdi's wish to move away from [...] "standard forms" [...] appears in his feelings about the structure of Il trovatore. To his librettist, Cammarano, Verdi plainly states in a letter of April 1851 <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no standard forms—"cavatinas, duets, trios, choruses, finales, etc. ... and if you could avoid beginning with an opening chorus....", he would be quite happy.|$|E

500|$|Walras' law was {{introduced}} as a theoretical {{answer to the}} problem of determining the solutions in general equilibrium. [...] His notation is different from modern notation but can be constructed using more modern summation notation. [...] Walras assumed that in equilibrium, all money would be spent on all goods: every good would be sold at the market price for that good and every buyer would expend their last dollar on a basket of goods. [...] Starting from this assumption, Walras could then show <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> n markets and n-1 markets cleared (reached equilibrium conditions) that the nth market would clear as well. [...] This is easiest to visualize with two markets (considered in most texts as a market for goods and a market for money). [...] If one of two markets has reached an equilibrium state, no additional goods (or conversely, money) can enter or exit the second market, so it must be in a state of equilibrium as well. [...] Walras used this statement to move toward a proof of existence of solutions to general equilibrium but it is commonly used today to illustrate market clearing in money markets at the undergraduate level.|$|E
500|$|Amid decolonisation and the Wind of Change, the Federation {{was looking}} ever more tenuous {{and the idea}} of [...] "no {{independence}} before majority rule" [...] was gaining considerable ground in British political circles. Harper called for Southern Rhodesia to abandon the Federation and [...] "go it alone". In June 1960 he and the Southern Rhodesian branch of the Dominion Party adopted the policy of [...] "Southern Rhodesia first", prompting strong protests from the party's Northern Rhodesian division; the Dominion Party splintered into separate Federal and territorial entities a month later. When black nationalist riots broke out in the townships in October 1960, Harper condemned the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Sir Edgar Whitehead and the governing United Federal Party (UFP) as too lenient on the protesters, and argued that giving concessions following political violence would make black Rhodesians believe that [...] "trouble pays dividends". Arguing against black representation in the Legislative Assembly, he said <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> black MPs [...] "they will share the restaurant with us and they will share the bars with us. We will be living cheek by jowl with them, and what sort of legislation can {{the people of this country}} expect when we ourselves are being conditioned to living cheek by jowl with Africans?" ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{being made}} a pariah, Brian is banned from every bar and {{convenience}} store in Quahog, {{making it impossible}} for him to drink. Desperate, and suffering from delirium tremens (he hallucinates seeing several alcoholic beverages begging him to drink them), Brian fakes his repentance and convinces Meg to cease all hostilities against him so he can get back to drinking, but she takes him to burn books that are [...] "harmful to God" [...] (including On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, and a book titled Logic for First Graders). A disgusted Brian admits his bluff and attempts to convince Meg that what she is doing is wrong. When Meg refuses to listen, Brian points out to her <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> truly a loving God, then he would not have created Meg to have an attractive mother like Lois but have her be unattractive like Peter, and that she would not be living with a family that holds her in contempt and otherwise pretends that she does not exist (along with not even caring enough about her to get her a mumps shot). Feeling ashamed, Meg concedes to Brian's argument and apologizes for her behavior, confessing that she does not know how she can feel loved. Brian then assures her that the answers are inside herself, and the real meaning of their existence is out there somewhere. Afterward, it is revealed that the entire Family Guy universe takes place within the molecules of a lampshade in the shared bedroom of Adam West and Rob Lowe.|$|E
