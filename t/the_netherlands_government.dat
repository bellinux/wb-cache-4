5|$|The wing's {{proposed}} move to New Britain was cancelled in May 1945, after <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands</b> <b>government</b> {{requested that}} its squadrons operate over the Dutch East Indies. No.120 Squadron {{was transferred to}} Biak, while No.79 Wing and its two Mitchell squadrons were ordered to move to Borneo, {{under the command of}} First Tactical Air Force. By July, No.79 Wing had relocated from Batchelor to Balikpapan, leaving No.13 Squadron under the control of North-Western Area Command. After the Pacific War ended in August 1945, the Mitchells joined Liberators of No.82 Wing repatriating RAAF personnel from Borneo to Australia. No.79 Wing Headquarters was disbanded on 8October. The following month, No.18 Squadron was reassigned to the Netherlands Air Force. No.2 Squadron returned to Australia in December, disbanding in mid-1946. These were the only two squadrons in the RAAF to operate Mitchells during the war.|$|E

5|$|Owing to the Allied withdrawal, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of their dead had to be left on the battlefield. Here they were buried in simple field graves (some little more than their own slit trenches) or in small mass graves dug by the Germans. Kate Ter Horst, whose house was used as a first aid post during the battle, found the graves of 57 men in her garden when she returned after the war. After Arnhem was liberated in April 1945, Grave Registration Units of the British 2nd Army moved into the area and began to locate the Allied dead. A small field north of Oosterbeek was offered on perpetual loan by <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands</b> <b>government</b> to the Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission) in June 1945 and the dead were reburied there. Many of those killed during Arnhem's liberation were also buried at the same site. The cemetery was completed in February 1946, originally with the graves marked by metal crosses, although these were replaced by headstones in 1952. Most of the German dead were buried in the SS Heroes Cemetery near Arnhem after the battle, but reburied in Ysselsteyn German war cemetery after the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{resilience}} of Indonesian Republican resistance and active international diplomacy set world opinion against the Dutch efforts to re-establish their colony. The second 'police action' was a diplomatic {{disaster for the}} Dutch cause. The newly appointed United States Secretary of State Dean Acheson pushed <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands</b> <b>government</b> into negotiations earlier recommended by the United Nations but until then defied by the Netherlands. The Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference was held in The Hague from 23 August 1949 to 2 November 1949 between the Republic, the Netherlands, and the Dutch-created federal states. The Netherlands agreed to recognise Indonesian sovereignty over a new federal state known as the 'United States of Indonesia' (RUSI). It would include all {{the territory of the}} former Dutch East Indies with the exception of Netherlands New Guinea; sovereignty over which it was agreed would be retained by the Netherlands until further negotiations with Indonesia. The other issue on which Indonesia gave concessions was Netherlands East Indies debt. Indonesia agreed to responsibility for this sum of £4.3billion, much of which was directly attributable to Dutch attempts to crush the revolution. Sovereignty was formally transferred on 27 December 1949, and the new state was immediately recognised by the United States of America.|$|E
25|$|The Netherlands entered World War II on May 10, 1940, when invading German forces quickly overran them.

Operation Market Garden, which started in 1944, liberated the southern and eastern parts of the country, but full liberation did not come until the surrender of Germany on May 5, 1945.|$|E

25|$|On 31 December 1953, {{the founder}} and {{president}} of KLM, Albert Plesman, {{died at the age of}} 64. He was succeeded as president by Fons Aler. After Plesman's death, the company and other airlines entered a difficult economic period.

25|$|Generally films {{produced}} in the Indies dealt with traditional stories or were adapted from existing works. The early films were silent, with Karnadi Anemer Bangkong (Karnadi the Frog Contractor; 1930) generally considered the first talkie; later films would be in Dutch, Malay, or an indigenous language. All were black-and-white. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all films from before 1950 are lost.
