40|$|A {{solid phase}} micro <b>tip</b> <b>extraction</b> (SPMTE) has been {{developed}} as sample preparation technique {{for the analysis of}} diclofenac sodium, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in human urine sample. The analysis was performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system using methanol:water (60 : 40, v/v) as mobile phase, flow rate of 1. 0 mL/min under UV detection wavelength at 282 nm. Extraction conditions such as desorption solvent and extraction time were optimized in this study. The optimized SPMTE coupled with the HPLC method was successfully applied for the determination of diclofenac sodium in urine samples. The best recovery of diclofenac sodium in urine samples is 74. 80 % with RSD of 3. 56 % (n= 3). The proposed method provides simple and rapid analysis of diclofenac sodium in urine sample...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of liquid membrane <b>tip</b> <b>extraction</b> (LMTE) for {{the extraction of}} organophosphorus pecticide (OPP) which is malathion was investigated. The LMTE was performed in dip extraction mode. The extraction parameters that were optimized are the type of extraction solvent, time of extraction and agitation of extraction. Quantification of the malathion was carried out using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Optimization was carried out using water sample spiked with malathion. Under the optimum conditions which are acetonitrile as a solvent of extraction, 60 min and 60 rpm, the method showed good regression which is 0. 9986 and showed acceptable reproducibility (RSD 7 %), low limits of detection of 1. 2 mg/L for malathion, and satisfactory relative recoveries (90 %). Due to the low cost, the LMTE device was disposed after each run. The validated method was tested {{for the analysis of}} analytes in spiked tap water with good success. LMTE expected to be able to provide low cost, simple technique and rapid extraction...|$|E

Three azole drugs, namely voriconazole (VRZ), ketoconazole (KTZ) and itraconazole (ITZ), were used as target analytes. The plasma was deproteinized prior to the extraction using methanol-dichloromethane (75 : 25, v/v). Optimized extractions were obtained using the following conditions: conditioning solvent, acetone; extraction time, 15 min; desorption time, 15 min; salt addition, 10 % (w/v); pH of sample solution, 8; sample volume, 15 mL and desorption solvent, methanol. A portion of the clean extract (20 μL) was injected into the HPLC-UV system for analysis. Under the optimized conditions, the method demonstrated good linearity with the correlation of determination, r 2 ≥ 0. 9958 in the concentration range of 60 - 8000 μg L- 1 and good limits of detection {{in the range of}} 20 - 40 μg L- 1. The method showed satisfactory precisions with RSDs < 16 % (n = 3) and high relative recoveries in the range of 82. 5 - 111. 0 %. The MCM- 41 -SPMTE method proved to be simple and efficient and requires minimal amounts of organic solvent that supports the green chemistry concept...|$|E

40|$|Tissue {{from the}} wing {{tips of the}} {{endangered}} Apollo butterfly (Parnassius apollo L.) were collected {{at the end of}} a breeding season from two sites in Norway: Bandak and Gjendetunga/Bukkelægret about 250 km apart. We investigated the suitability of such non-lethal samples as a source of DNA for studying these populations. Universal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) primers were used to amplify DNA from the wing <b>tip</b> <b>extractions.</b> Primers spanning the 12 s rRNA region produced 0. 35 kb fragments that proved to be invariable in the selected samples when tested for restriction length polymorphisms (RFLPs). These sequences had high homology with analogous mtDNA from other insect sources, e. g. lepidoptera [Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) ], and served to authenticate the DNA. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs) technology was then used to screen for genetic variability. Of several primers tested, Primer- 01 (Operon Kit F) produced a profile that differentiated the population with 88 % (P< 0. 001) efficiency based on multivariate logistic regression analysis of banding profiles. RAPDs were also adapted to develop different molecular marker approaches to screen the samples quickly and cheaply. This work indicates that reliable ‘molecular tags’ can be designed to track demographic populations to study their distribution without endangering the butterfly and highlights the suitability of these markers for use in future population studies...|$|R
50|$|More {{severe than}} the {{difficulties}} with handling are losses of material while processing the samples. The mass spectrometric protein analysis is often {{performed at the}} limit of detection, so even small losses can decide about {{success or failure of}} the whole analysis. These losses are due to washout during different processing steps, adsorption to the surface of reaction tubes and pipette <b>tips,</b> incomplete <b>extraction</b> of peptides from the gel and/or bad ionisation of single peptides in the mass spectrometer. Depending on the physicochemical properties of the peptides, losses can vary between 15 and 50%. Due to the inherent heterogeneity of the peptides, up to now, a universally valid solution for this major drawback of the method has not been found.|$|R
40|$|A dynamic {{supported}} {{liquid membrane}} <b>tip</b> <b>extraction</b> (SLMTE) procedure for the effective extraction and preconcentration of glyphosate (GLYP) and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in {{water has been}} investigated. The SLMTE procedure was performed in a semi-automated dynamic mode and demonstrated a greater performance against a static extraction. Several important extraction parameters such as donor phase pH, cationic carrier concentration, type of membrane solvent, type of acceptor stripping phase, agitation and extraction time were comprehensively optimized. A solution of Aliquat- 336, a cationic carrier, in dihexyl ether {{was selected as the}} supported liquid incorporated into the membrane phase. Quantification of GLYP and AMPA was carried out using capillary electrophoresis with contactless conductivity detection. An electrolyte solution consisting of 12 mM histidine (His), 8 mM 2 -(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 75 mu M cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), 3 % methanol, pH 6. 3, was used as running buffer. Under the optimum extraction conditions, the method showed good linearity in the range of 0. 01 - 200 mu g/L (GLYP) and 0. 1 - 400 mu g/L (AMPA), acceptable reproducibility (RSD 5 - 7 %, n = 5), low limits of detection of 0. 005 mu g/L for GLYP and 0. 06 mu g/L for AMPA, and satisfactory relative recoveries (90 - 94 %). Due to the low cost, the SLMTE device was disposed after each run which additionally eliminated the possibility of carry-over between runs. The validated method was tested for the analysis of both analytes in spiked tap water and river water with good success. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Arylalkanoic acid drugs {{belong to}} the group of non-steroidal {{antiinflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs). These drugs are often used for the treatment of fever and minor pain due to its capability to inhibit prostaglandin productions which act as a messenger molecule in human body. There are many methods used in previous research to analyse arylalkanoic acids drugs but most of the methods require high organic solvent consumption, time consuming and involve complex sample derivatization. Solid phase extraction (SPE) is the common method used for sample preparation of NSAIDs but also involves high organic solvent consumption and is time consuming. To overcome the problems, solid phase membrane <b>tip</b> <b>extraction</b> (SPMTE) coupled with microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography (MEEKC) were used in this study and its performance was evaluated. Under the optimum MEEKC and SPMTE conditions, good linearity was obtained in the range of 0. 25 to 4. 00 µg/mL with good coefficient of determination (r 2 > 0. 9985). Good repeatability was obtained with percentage relative standard deviation (% RSD) of 1. 04 - 1. 31 % (n= 3). Limit of detection (LOD) (S/N = 3) was satisfactory for all the selected drugs (0. 14 - 0. 18 µg/mL). The average relative recoveries of the selected drugs in spiked water sample were good (99 - 104 %). Combination of SPMTE procedure and the MEEKC method was then applied to the determination of spiked sulindac, ketorolac and aceclofenac in human urine samples. The percentage recoveries of the three NSAIDs obtained from the SPMTE-MEEKC method were good, ranging from 79 to 96 %. Percentage relative standard deviation (% RSD), (n= 3) for the extraction process was also good (< 3. 7 %). The result was then compared to SPE-MEEKC method. SPE-MEEKC method shows slightly higher percentage recovery (95 - 112 %) and lower RSD % (n= 3) (1. 33 - 2. 06 %) than SPMTE-MEEKC method. The SPMTE-MEEKC method was proven to be applicable to human urine analysis of sulindac, ketorolac and aceclofenac with faster analysis time and low amount of organic solvent used than in SPE-MEEKC method...|$|E
40|$|Microporous carbon spheres possess {{outstanding}} adsorptive {{properties and}} thus are advantageous {{in the development of}} solid phase microextraction sample preparation techniques. In this study, the feasibility of using microporous carbon spheres for the extraction of selected nitrosamines from water samples using solid phase membrane <b>tip</b> <b>extraction</b> (SPMTE) technique was investigated. Two types of adsorbents namely non-activated carbon spheres (NCS) and chemically activated microporous carbon spheres (MCS) were hydrothermally synthesized from sucrose. The prepared adsorbents were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nitrogen adsorption analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Both adsorbents were spherical in shape as indicated by SEM. The FTIR spectra showed that the NCS and MCS have various surface functional groups such as OH, C=C and C-H which act as active sites. The surface areas of NCS and MCS are 7. 88 and 308. 10 m 2 /g, respectively as obtained from nitrogen adsorption analysis. The two prepared materials and a commercial activated carbon (granular activated carbon, GAC) were used in SPMTE to extract the selected nitrosamines namely Nnitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), N-nitosodipropylamine (NDPA), N-nitrosopiperidine (NPIP) and N-nitrosodiphenylamine (NDPhA) from tap water and lake water matrices. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) was used for quantitative analysis of the target analytes in the extracts. The optimized SPMTE conditions were conditioning solvent, extraction time, salt addition, pH, desorption solvent, desorption time and sample volume. Under the optimized conditions, the method showed good linearity in the range of 10 - 100 µg/L, good coefficients of determination (r 2 = 0. 9984 - 0. 9994), good precision (relative standard deviations, RSD < 9 %, n = 3) and low limits of detection (LOD = 3. 2 - 4. 8 µg/L) for all the adsorbents. The extraction performance of each adsorbent was evaluated and compared in terms of percent recovery. The results showed that MCS gave better percent recovery in the range of 83. 2 - 107. 5 % than both NCS (65. 5 - 100. 3 %) and GAC (69. 7 - 100. 9 %). This infers that MCS offered improved extraction efficiency and higher recovery of the tested nitrosamines compared to conventional activated carbon...|$|E

40|$|A new {{titanium}} (IV) butoxide-cyanopropyltriethoxysilane (Ti-CNPrTEOS) hybrid {{material was}} successfully synthesized as sorbent for {{the extraction of}} polar aromatic amines. The sorbent was synthesized by hydrolysis and condensation of titanium (IV) butoxide and cyanopropyltriethoxysilane {{with the presence of}} hydrochloric acid as catalyst via sol-gel method. Under the optimum synthesis conditions (tetrahydrofuran as solvent, 1. 2 M of hydrochloric acid catalyst, 4 mol of water content with ratio of titanium (IV) butoxide and cyanopropylteriethoxysilane of 1 : 1 and aging temperature of 60 °C), the sorbents were characterized by Fourier Transform-Infrared, Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy, CHN elemental analysis, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) desorption and thermogravimetric analysis. A solid phase extraction (SPE) method has been developed using Ti-CNPrTEOS sorbent for the determination of aromatic amines and optimum experimental conditions were sample at pH 7, dichloromethane as conditioning solvent, 10 mL sample loading volume, 5 mL of acetonitrile as the eluting solvent. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) using Ti-CNPrTEOS SPE sorbent (0. 01 - 0. 20; 0. 03 - 0. 61 µgL- 1) were absolutely lower compared with those achieved using silica-cyanopropyl (Si-CN) SPE sorbent (0. 23 - 1. 47; 0. 75 - 4. 91 µgL- 1) and C 18 SPE sorbent (0. 36 - 0. 98; 1. 54 - 2. 56 µgL- 1). The recoveries and repeatability obtained from water samples using the sol–gel Ti-CNPrTEOS SPE sorbent were 57 – 99 % and RSDs 1 – 4 %, n= 5. The lowest recovery of non-polar diethylaniline, DEA (57 %) indicated that the sorbent was very selective towards the extraction of polar aromatic amines. Ti-CNPrTEOS sorbent was also successfully applied as sorbent for solid phase membrane <b>tip</b> <b>extraction</b> (SPMTE). Under the optimum extraction conditions; 15 mL of sample at pH 7, acetonitrile as conditioning and desorption organic solvent, extraction time of 15 min and desorption time of 15 min, the method showed good linearity with acceptable reproducibility (RSD 2. 5 – 3. 6 %, n = 5) and LOD and LOQ for Ti-CNPrTEOS SPMTE (0. 13 – 6. 23 ngL- 1; 0. 53 – 5. 67 ngL- 1) were lower with those achieved by C 18 -SPE (0. 36 - 0. 98 gL- 1; 1. 54 - 2. 56 gL- 1). The application of the Ti-CNPrTEOS SPMTE sorbent was successfully carried out by analysis of aromatic amines in river water sample with the recovery between 49 – 99 %. The lowest recovery of non-polar DEA (49 %) indicated that the sorbent was very selective towards the extraction of polar aromatic amines.

40|$|Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a simple, sensitive, {{rapid and}} solvent-free {{technique}} for {{the extraction of}} analytes from gaseous, liquid and solid samples and takes a leading position among microextraction methods. Application of SPME in sample preparation has been increasing continuously over the last decade.

40|$|In this study, we {{developed}} a self-assembly pipette <b>tip</b> solid-phase <b>extraction</b> (PTSPE) method using a high molecular weight polymer material (PAX) as the adsorbent for the determination of domoic acid (DA) in human urine samples by liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) analysis. The PTSPE cartridge, assembled by packing 9. 1 mg of PAX as sorbent into a 200 μL pipette tip, showed high adsorption capacity for DA owing to the strong cationic properties of PAX. Compared with conventional SPE, the PTSPE is simple and fast, and shows some advantages in the aspects of less solvent consumption, low cost, {{the absence of the}} evaporation step, and short time requirement. All the parameters influencing the extraction efficiency such as pH, the amount of sorbent, the number of aspirating/dispensing cycles, and the type and volume of eluent in PTSPE were carefully investigated and optimized. Under the optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) values of DA were 0. 12 μg/L and 0. 37 μg/L respectively. The extraction recoveries of DA from the urine samples spiked at four different concentrations were in a range from 88. 4 % to 102. 5 %.

In this extraction procedure, the aqueous sample was taken in an indigenously fabricated home-made glass extraction device (an 8 mL glass tube inbuilt with a self-scaled capillary <b>tip)</b> and <b>extraction</b> solvent (low density organic solvent) was added to it followed by ultrasonication. After extraction, the upper extractant layer was narrowed into the self-scaled capillary tip by pushing the plunger plug; thus making the collection and measurement of the upper organic solvent layer simple and convenient. Parameters affecting the extraction efficiency such as selection of extraction solvent, extraction solvent volume, ultrasonication time, pH and ionic strength were thoroughly investigated and optimized. Under optimal conditions, the method showed good linearity in the concentration range from 20 – 2000 ng L− 1 with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9982 for the target analyte. The limit of detection was 4 ng L− 1 and the enrichment factor obtained was 331. The method was validated with real water samples and the relative recoveries of environmental water samples ranged between 91. 2 and 97. 3 % and relative standard deviations ranged between 2. 8 and 5. 4 %, making the proposed method highly reliable. Moreover, the present approach avoids the usage of chlorinated organic extraction solvents and derivatization processes for triclosan determination.

The chromatography column consisted of 32 parallel microchannels with common input and output ports and was fabricated by lithography directly on the polymeric substrate followed by plasma etching (i. e. standard MEMS processing) and sealed with lamination. The liquid deposited TiO(2) -ZrO(2) stationary phase was characterized by X-ray diffraction and {{was found to be}} mostly TiO(2) and ZrO(2) in crystalline phases.

All of them {{are based on the}} known measurement technique of two lines with different lengths on the measured substrate after earlier calibration with standard substrate. The first one doesn’t involve the knowledge of the reference planes location and their shift to the probe <b>tips</b> in the <b>extraction</b> process and allows arbitrary position of the probe tips along the lines (not necessarily located at a position approximately in front of the physical beginning of the lines). In effect equivalent element models of error boxes representing the feeding discontinuities don’t have to be lumped models.

This new formulation allows to omit one of the limitations of the S-matrix asymmetry of an arbitrary reciprocal junction (in our case probe-tip discontinuity). This limitation is a complex characteristic impedance of the meausred lines. The third procedure allows to determine the characterisitc impedance of the lines with the wider or narrower pitch than that of the used probes.

40|$|CD-AFMs (critical {{dimension}} atomic force microscopes) are instruments with servo-control of the tip in {{more than}} one direction. With appropriately “boot-shaped ” or flared tips, such instruments can image vertical or even undercut features. As with any AFM, the image is a dilation of the sample shape with the <b>tip</b> shape. Accurate <b>extraction</b> of the CD requires a correction for the tip effect. Analytical methods to correct images for the tip shape have been available for some time for the traditional (vertical feedback only) AFMs, but were until recently unavailable for instruments with multi-dimensional feedback. Dahlen et al. [J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B 23, pp. 2297 - 2303, (2005) ] recently introduced a swept-volume approach, implemented for 2 -dimensional (2 D) feedback. It permits image simulation and sample reconstruction, techniques previously developed for the traditional instruments, to be extended for the newer tools. We have introduced [X. Qian and J. S. Villarrubia, Ultramicroscopy, in press] an alternative dexel-based method, that does the same in either 2 D or 3 D. This paper describes the application of this method to sample shapes of interest in semiconductor manufacturing. When the tip shape is known (e. g., by prior measurement using a tip characterizer) a 3 D sample surface may be reconstructed from its 3 D image. Basing the CD measurement upon such a reconstruction is shown here to remove some measurement artifacts that are not removed (or are incompletely removed) by the existing measurement procedures...|$|R

Following tryptic digestion and extended liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry acquisitions, data were processed using MaxQuant and Gene Ontology (GO) terms used to determine protein subcellular localization. The following techniques were examined for the total number and percentage purity of PM proteins identified: (a) whole cell lysate (total number, 84 – 112; percentage purity, 9 – 13 %); (b) crude membrane preparation (104 – 111; 17 – 20 %); (c) biotinylation of surface proteins with N-hydroxysulfosuccinimydyl-S,S-biotin and streptavidin pulldown (78 – 115; 27 – 31 %); (d) biotinylation of surface glycoproteins with biocytin hydrazide and streptavidin pulldown (41 – 54; 59 – 85 %); or (e) biotinylation of surface glycoproteins with amino-oxy-biotin (which labels the sialylated fraction of PM glycoproteins) and streptavidin pulldown (120; 65 %). A two- to threefold increase in {{the overall number of}} proteins identified was achieved by using stop and go <b>extraction</b> <b>tip</b> (StageTip) -based anion exchange (SAX) fractionation. Combining technique (e) with SAX fractionation increased the number of proteins identified to 281 (54 %).

These are likely to be of PM location and bring the total PM protein identifications to 364 (68 %).

40|$|Samples for {{forensic}} DNA {{analysis are}} often collected {{from a wide}} variety of objects using cotton or nylon tipped swabs. Testing has shown that significant quantities of DNA are retained on the swab, however, and subsequently lost. When processing evidentiary samples, the recovery of the maximum amount of available DNA is critical, potentially dictating whether a usable profile can be derived from a piece of evidence or not. The QIAamp DNA Investigator extraction kit was used with its recommended protocol for swabs (one hour incubation at 56 °C) as a baseline. Results indicate that over 50 % of the recoverable DNA may be retained on the cotton swab tip, or otherwise lost, for both blood and buccal cell samples when using this protocol. The protocol's incubation time and temperature were altered, as was incubating while shaking or stationary to test for increases in recovery efficiency. An additional step was then tested that included periodic re-suspension of the swab <b>tip</b> in the <b>extraction</b> buffer during incubation. Aliquots of liquid blood or a buccal cell suspension were deposited and dried on cotton swabs and compared with swab-less controls. The concentration of DNA in each extract was quantified and STR analysis was performed to assess the quality of the extracted DNA. Stationary incubations and those performed at 65 °C did not result in significant gains in DNA yield. Samples incubated for 24 hours yielded less DNA. Increased yields were observed with three and 18 hour incubation periods. Increases in DNA yields were also observed using a swab re-suspension method for both cell types. The swab re-suspension method yielded an average two-fold increase in recovered DNA yield with buccal cells and an average three-fold increase with blood cells. These findings demonstrate that more of the DNA collected on swabs can be recovered with specific protocol alterations...|$|R

Each spin step (with 200 μL buffer loaded) takes around 2 min at 4, 000 rpm. Compared with previous syringe-based manual pressure device, the spinnable StageTip is completely labor-free, automatable, and can be easily scaled up. Considered with the recently developed 96 FASP method, the spinnable StageTips provide another component to the high throughput workflow for clinical proteomics and biomarker discoveries. ### Introduction Shotgun (or bottom-up) -based proteomic technologies in clinical researches have enabled the identification of many potential biomarkers for various diseases (1 - 3). A typical workflow of such technologies usually involves protein extraction from tissues or body fluids followed by enzymatic digestion and then chromatographic fractionation and mass spectrometric identification (LC-MS/MS) (4, 5). To prepare high quality peptide samples for LC-MS, {{it is very important to}} ensure the overall quality of shotgun proteomics experiments. Peptide samples collected after digestion usually need to be cleaned to remove salts, possible gel pieces (for in-gel digested samples) or particles (for in-solution digested samples), which otherwise will damage the LC switching valves or clog the columns. As shown in Figure 1, the arrows indicate two ports of the six-port valve are damaged probably by salt crystals or other type of particles. While running under nano flow (usually ≤ 300 nL/min), these damages may cause inconsistent backpressure or sample loss which are not easily seen. This is one of the reasons our lab prefers cleaning the samples prior to LCMS analysis instead of doing on-line desalting. The protocol to use stop-and-go-extraction tips (StageTips) for desalting is simple, flexible and has been applied widely in proteomics labs (6, 7). In this protocol, an ordinary pipette tip is packed with single or multiple layers of C 18 materials that are pre-embedded into the Teflon support (7). This tip can then serve as a desalting tip, and works in a way similar to commercial ZipTips (Millipore). The packing can also be customized to include different types of materials or in combination such as SCX and SAX to perform fractionation (7 - 9), or to serve as a barrier to support other types of chromatographic beads loaded on top 10. This tip-based, column-free and pump-free chromatographic separation provides a simple alternative to traditional HPLC-based separation (8, 10 - 12). To process samples using StageTips, one has to find a pressure device to load samples in and elute samples out of the tips. As originally suggested, a plastic syringe is commonly used to manually force buffers through the tips. In our lab, depending on the amount of samples and salt conditions inside, finishing one sample with a syringe may take up to ten minutes. This sounds relatively easy when dealing with only a few samples ( 40 min for binding, washing and elution), while spin with 3000 rpm or above decrease the processing time dramatically. For example, to active the tips with 200 μL Buffer A and Buffer D only takes 5 min with 3000 rpm. We analyzed the samples (with three replicates under each condition) with nanoLC-Q Exactive MS/MS. The number of protein identifications did not show significant variations. We used 4000 rpm to process StageTips in all our experiments. - Peptide desalting using adaptors and StageTips: This procedure is adapted from the published protocol 7. Several changes have been made in order to better fit the sample processing in our lab. - 1. Follow the instructions on the published protocol, pack single or multiple layers of C 18 into the tips. Pack as many as you need. - 2. Place packed tips with the adaptor into the 2. 0 mL microtubes (as shown in Figure 4). - 3. Conditioning I: load 200 µL buffer A (methanol) into the tips, spin at 4000 rpm for ~ 1 min; Conditioning II: load 200 µL buffer D (0. 5 % acetic acid, 80 % acetonitrile and 20 % H 2 O) into the tips, spin at 4000 rpm for ~ 1 min. - 4. Equilibration: load 200 µL buffer B (0. 5 % acetic acid in H 2 O) into the tips, spin at 4000 rpm for ~ 1 min. - 5. Resuspend the dried peptide samples into 100 µL of buffer B, and vortex for around 10 min. The peptides may come from in-gel digestion, in-solution digestion, filter aided sample preparation (FASP) or 96 FASP 16. - 6. Binding: load 100 µL peptide solutions in the tips and spin at 4000 rpm for about 1. 5 min. Re-load the flow-through into the tips and spin again. Repeat this binding step 2 ~ 3 times. - 7. Wash: load 200 µL buffer B and spin at 4000 rpm for 2 ~ 3 min. Discard the flow-through. - 8. Elution: place the StageTips into new collection tubes; load 200 µL buffer C, spin at 4000 rpm for ~ 2 min; load 200 µL buffer D, spin at 4000 rpm for ~ 2 min, repeat elution with buffer D one more time. The total volume of the elution is ~ 600 μL. - 9. Dry the peptide elutes in Speed-Vac, re-suspend with HPLC buffer for immediate LC-MS/MS analysis, or store at - 80 °C until further use. ### References 1. Konvalinka, A.; Scholey, J.

40|$|Understanding the {{properties}} of matter at the atomic scale, results considerable progress {{in science and technology}} in the late 20 th century, is one of progress that has {{led to the development of}} what is now called nanoscience. Richard P. Feynman, Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work on electrodynamics Quantum had prophesied in the 19, 591 range of possibilities opened up by the manipulation of material atom by atom. The laws of physics no longer apply to macroscopic this scale and become purely quantum behavior. You can change {{the properties}} of matter thus paving the way for futuristic applications. Nanotechnology - concepts and methods for nanoscience applications - have vast fields of applications in microelectronics and materials by example. And the opportunities are increasing for these specific areas but also in biotechnology, photonics and information technology suggestive of social and economic benefits énormes 2. Yet it has long used nanomaterials (glass, ceramics, [...] .) and chemists rely on molecules of different sizes. Can we then consider this science as news? In fact, what has changed is the opportunity, through the development new tools, make, observe, analyze, assemble, understand nano-objects which are the building blocks of nanotechnology. In this manuscript, we will consider the particular case of new molecules: carbon nanotubes are studied for their remarkable properties. Their qualities electron transport are candidates for the realization of transistors, diodes or more RAM. Their mechanical properties and low weight make it any component of composite materials. Finally, their high aspect ratios due to micrometer lengths and radii are nanoscale electron sources very interesting field emission that can be used in flat screens for microscopy. This latter application of carbon nanotubes as electron source in the void that is the cause of all this work and is the subject of this brief. When the transistor was invented by Bardeen, Brattain and Shockley in the years 19, 503 and the first integrated circuits were introduced in 19604 years, it seemed that the time of the electronic vacuum was counted. The emission in the vacuum thermionic effect indeed requires heating a cathode to about 1000 ° C to make electrons. Yet in 1961, the Stanford Research Shoulders Institute (SRI) has the idea of a new device, micrometer-sized, based on the tunnel effect, as a new électrons 5 source. And what are the manufacturing technologies from the microelectronics which will enable the manufacture of these new electron sources say cold (because operating at room temperature) based on this principle purely quantum. Thus, when in 1968, Spindt, Shoulders hired by the IRS, published his first Results on the production of spikes in pyramidal molybdène 6, it triggers an interest for electronic transmitters and a rebound in electronics in vacuum with target applications such as flat panel displays, high frequency devices, [...] . So the early years of the scientific community will be almost exclusively dedicated to improving this specific type of issuer. One of the finest achievements being demonstration of operation in 1993 a flat screen 6 "based on this technologie 7. From 1994, however, this community will gradually turn towards new materials more robust and also easier and cheaper to produce. This is In 1995 and Rinzler 8 Heer 9 will demonstrate the electron emission from nanotubes carbon, a new form of carbon discovered in 1991 by Iijima 10. Properties geometric, electrical, mechanical, chemical properties of these objects are indeed a material remarkable for the field emission. They are also extremely robust and processes growth used to manufacture low-cost (over large areas) cathode very performance. In addition, one of the big disadvantages of Spindt tips for use at high frequencies is the proximity between the <b>tip</b> and the <b>extraction</b> grid (~ 1 μm) which is imposed by the manufacturing process and leads to higher capacity thereby limiting the frequency use. With carbon nanotubes, this issue was raised with the possibility to exclude the grid at greater distances (~ 100 μm) and cutoff frequencies and more high. With amplification factors much larger than the spikes pyramidal it also maintains a flight with reasonable voltages. The study of field emission properties of carbon nanotubes will be and the bulk of this manuscript in which we will also try to show the benefits of these sources compared to other materials. The goal here is the use of these sources in microwave tube amplifiers. The basic idea that led to this study is as follows: the thermionic cathodes Conventional satisfactory and are still under development. There has currently no reason to replace the tubes. However one perceives the need a new technology for high frequencies (> 30 GHz). The dream of the designers electronic tubes and is replaced by the hot cathode cold cathode which integration should allow one hand to reduce the size and weight of at least a factor of 2 and above all to significantly improve performance, particularly at high frequencies. The cutoff points such as "Spindt" being too weak to address this frequency zone (a demonstration of 199, 711 in 10 GHz modulation is still Today the state of the art on these devices), carbon nanotubes provide a technology interesting and challenging to replace the hot cathode. But for that must develop a source that can issue a certain density currents with certain life. This has been the object of this work: designing, developing, understand, optimize a field emission source based on carbon nanotubes. The first part will introduce the world of tubes and microwave sources electronics. We try to understand the limits of current technology and the interest presented by these new sources of carbon nanotubes. The second part will focus on the material. Firstly through its exceptional Properties and methods of manufacture. A state of the art of its use as a source electronics allow us to understand the direction we have chosen to make powerful sources. We present the main experimental achievements. The third part will be devoted to field emission in nanotubes individual carbon. In presenting specific tool that was used for these measures and main results that allowed us to understand and improve the performance. The fourth part will be when it dedicated to the field emission measurements on networks of nanotubes. We present the main results. These will coupled with individual results to show that it is possible to predict the behavior a cathode. The fifth part will demonstrate the modulation of an electron beam Microwave from a carbon nanotube cathode. First results obtained in a diode at 1. 5 GHz. Then those obtained in a triode 30 GHz. We will end with all these results, what they bring to the understanding This new type of sources and perspectives they open when the use of cellesci in commercial devices. La compréhension des propriétés de la matière à l'échelle atomique, résultats d'avancées considérables en sciences et en technologies de la fin du 20 e siècle, est l'un des progrès qui a conduit au développement de ce que l'on appelle aujourd'hui les nanosciences. Richard P. Feynman, prix Nobel de physique en 1965 pour ses travaux sur l'électrodynamique quantique, avait prophétisé en 19591 l'étendue des possibilités qu'ouvrirait la manipulation de la matière atome par atome. Les lois de la physique macroscopique ne s'appliquent plus à cette échelle et les comportements deviennent purement quantiques. On peut modifier les propriétés de la matière ouvrant ainsi la voie à des applications futuristes. Les nanotechnologies – concepts et procédés des nanosciences en vue d'applications - ont déjà de vastes champs d'applications en microélectronique et en matériaux par exemple. Et les possibilités vont en s'accroissant, pour ces domaines spécifiques mais aussi en biotechnologie, en photonique et dans les technologies de l'information laissant supposer des retombées sociales et économiques énormes 2. Pourtant, on utilise depuis longtemps des nanomatériaux (verres, céramiques, [...] .) et les chimistes font appel à des molécules de tailles diverses. Peut-on alors considérer cette science comme nouvelle? En fait, ce qui a changé, c'est la possibilité, grâce au développement de nouveaux outils, de fabriquer, d'observer, d'analyser, d'assembler, de comprendre des nano-objets qui sont les briques de base des nanotechnologies. Dans ce manuscrit, nous nous intéresserons au cas particulier de nouvelles molécules: les nanotubes de carbone qui sont étudiés pour leurs remarquables propriétés. Leurs qualités de transport électronique en font des candidats pour la réalisation de transistors, de diodes ou encore de mémoires RAM. Leurs propriétés mécaniques et leur faible poids en font un éventuel composant de matériaux composites. Enfin leurs rapports d'aspect élevés dus à des longueurs micrométriques et des rayons nanométriques en font des sources d'électrons par émission de champ très intéressantes qui peuvent servir dans des écrans plats ou pour la microscopie électronique. C'est cette dernière application des nanotubes de carbone comme source d'électrons dans le vide qui est à l'origine de tout ce travail de thèse et fait l'objet du présent mémoire. Lorsque le transistor fut inventé par Bardeen, Brattain, et Shockley dans les années 19503 et que les premiers circuits intégrés ont fait leur apparition dans les années 19604, il semblait que le temps de l'électronique sous vide était compté. L'émission dans le vide par effet thermoïonique nécessite en effet de chauffer une cathode à environ 1000 °C pour émettre des électrons. Pourtant en 1961, Shoulders du Stanford Research Institute (SRI) a l'idée d'un nouveau dispositif, de taille micrométrique, basé sur l'effet tunnel, comme une nouvelle source d'électrons 5.
