It happened overnight and I couldn't think of anything but our friends and our situation. Then I started to maybe realise that group wasn't so good for me, and that my old friends and my family are the people I should be with. It's about being drawn into <b>this</b> <b>crazy</b> world, and you’re all in love".|$|E
500|$|Bell {{compared}} Most Wanted to the Buffy the Vampire Slayer spin-off Angel, {{saying the}} series {{would be more}} intimate than Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. because {{at the heart of}} the series would be the question, [...] "What's the metaphor of the relationship that's going to dramatize over the course of the episode versus the larger machinations of the world that S.H.I.E.L.D. [...] in?" [...] Palicki said the pilot is less based in Marvel mythology and more focused on the two characters, whose dynamic she compared to Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Blood added, [...] "It’s exploring how you make a relationship work with the backdrop of all <b>this</b> <b>crazy</b> stuff that goes on" [...] in their world.|$|E

500|$|In the {{introduction}} to their essay [...] "Kurt Vonnegut and Humor", Tally and Peter C. Kunze suggest that Vonnegut was not a [...] "black humorist", but a [...] "frustrated idealist" [...] who used [...] "comic parables" [...] to teach the reader absurd, bitter or hopeless truths, with his grim witticisms serving to make the reader laugh rather than cry. [...] "Vonnegut makes sense through humor, which is, in the author's view, as valid a means of mapping <b>this</b> <b>crazy</b> world as any other strategies." [...] Vonnegut resented being called a black humorist, feeling that, as with many literary labels, it allows readers to disregard aspects of a writer's work that do not fit the label's stereotype.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé also {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} [...] "Haunted" [...] on her iTunes Radio channel where she also revealed her admiration for Boots, [...] "The song is really about temptation in this music industry and being exposed to <b>this</b> <b>crazy</b> madness."

[...] "Haunted" [...] was recorded at Jungle City Studios and Oven Studios, both located in New York City {{under the guidance of}} Boots and Stuart White.

Casablancas's stepfather and Moretti's and Fraiture's older brothers introduced the quartet {{to the music}} of reggae artist Bob Marley, protopunk group the Velvet Underground, and alternative rock band Jane's Addiction. Discussing the formative stages of the group, Moretti noted, [...] "Our music was, like, , but trying to be classical. We all took music classes and tried writing songs, and when we put them together they were <b>this</b> <b>crazy</b> amalgam of insane ideas that we thought was really cool." [...] In 1998, Albert Hammond, Jr., who Casablancas knew from his time at a Swiss boarding school, moved to New York City to attend film school and joined The Strokes as a second guitarist. His arrival provided the catalyst for the band's musical and emotional evolution.|$|E

500|$|Haynes {{had first}} heard about the film in 2012 from costume {{designer}} Sandy Powell, who informed him that Blanchett was attached and Karlsen was producing. Blanchett, who served as an executive producer through her production company Dirty Films Ltd., had {{been involved with the}} project for [...] "a long time". Haynes learned {{they were looking for a}} director when Vachon approached him in 2013. He regarded the story, its historical and social context, and collaborating again with Blanchett as motivating factors for his involvement. [...] "What was so interesting to me when I first read this script", Haynes said, [...] "is how it basically links that hothouse mentality of the desiring subject ... to that of the criminal subject, in that both are these over-productive minds that are conjuring narratives constantly ... <b>this</b> <b>crazy</b> state of this furtive hyperactivity in the mind." [...] Haynes collaborated with Blanchett on a dramaturgical level.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Call of da Wild" [...] {{discusses}} {{the temptation to}} drop out of school, while [...] "Git Up, Git Out" [...] encourages teenagers to follow their passions, be productive, and stop using drugs. The latter is an intertextual track that mixes themes of consciousness and political awareness with images of violence, sex, drugs, and gangsta culture. It features guest rapper Cee Lo Green exploring perspectives of both [...] and maternal figure. [...] "Funky Ride" [...] has no rappers and is instead sung by R group Society of Soul, a side project of Organized Noize. It has an extended guitar solo and musical similarities to Funkadelic and Bootsy Collins. [...] "Crumblin' Erb" [...] explores themes of hedonism and addresses black-on-black violence and the negative effect it has on African-American culture: [...] "There's only so much time left in <b>this</b> <b>crazy</b> world / I'm just crumblin' [...] / Niggas killin' niggas, they don't understand (it's the master plan), I'm just crumblin' erb" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by co-showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, and {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman. Executive producer Joe Chappelle directed. Pinkner and Wyman approached the episode [...] "like a new pilot" [...] {{to draw in}} viewers who wanted to watch the show but did not know when to start. They used Lincoln Lee {{as a tool to}} acquaint viewers with the new changes. Former guest actor Seth Gabel, who played Lee, joined the cast as a series regular for the fourth season. He believed his character allowed the audience to see Fringe Division from a new perspective. He explained, [...] "You need a layman's perspective from time to time. The show has gotten so deep into <b>this</b> <b>crazy,</b> surreal scientific world that you need someone to enter every now and then to remind you this is not the common experience. You need someone to show you how far down the rabbit hole you’ve gone, so you don't become desensitized to it. I think Lincoln serves that for a while." ...|$|E

500|$|Messick {{said they}} {{designed}} [...] "a fairy tale, mythological fantasy world" [...] {{that feels like}} it happened long time ago but is not set in any particular time period. Marlene Stewart created the film's costumes, using traditional leather and linen but without an antique look. Its steampunk-like, retro-futuristic weapons were created by the weapon designer Simon Boucherie and Wirkola, who said they wanted Hansel and Gretel's weapons {{to look as if}} the characters hand-made them. Wirkola stated he [...] "just wanted <b>this</b> <b>crazy,</b> mashed-up world where you can’t pinpoint where it is, or when it is" [...] and the modern elements are there to [...] "add to the fun and tone of the film." [...] He said, [...] "We wanted the movie to feel timeless and for the movie to feel like a fairy tale, but still grounded. It {{was a lot of fun}} coming up with the different weapon designs and ways of killing witches. We mixed old and new elements. But no matter how modern some of the weapons are, they all have an old-fashioned feel and look like they could fit into this world." ...|$|E
500|$|La Dispute {{recorded}} {{the remainder of}} the album in a month in StadiumRed in New York City in April 2011. Dreyer wanted to give the album the most organic feel possible by using no artificial reverb or studio techniques that would give the album a synthesized quality. Joe Pedulla stated that he wanted to give the album a more raw and authentic sound: [...] "We were just trying to capture {{what it would be like}} for an audience member sitting and listening to a guitar in a room." [...] He also credited Dreyer's vocal range: [...] "Jordan Dreyer has <b>this</b> <b>crazy</b> dynamic range – a 20dB swing from how loud and quiet he gets. So there are some vocal parts with no resonance at all, where he's speaking/singing softly, the room is not echoing, and he sounds close and in-your-face. Then the dynamic swing happens, and we would see how big it can get." [...] When recording vocals, Dreyer makes very long takes, trying to emulate the sound of his voice in live performances. The album's recording features what the band considers [...] "auxiliary instrumentation", including trumpet and rhodes piano, and even improvised instruments that Sterenburg's brother created out of scrap metal.|$|E
500|$|Hock Guan Teh of DVD Town said {{he enjoyed}} the episode, and {{although}} it does not contain the [...] "usual amount" [...] of The Simpsons humor, the [...] "rich character development itself makes this episode worth multiple viewings.

[...] Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict thought the episode featured [...] "one of the best" [...] parodies the Simpsons writers have ever conceived, the parody of the country television series Hee-Haw called Ya-Hoo!: [...] "While one must give multiple kudos to Beverly D'Angelo for writing and performing her own witty hillbilly ditties, it's the twisted cornpone , with such stars as Big Shirtless Ron and Cappy Mae, that really propels this installment into comic heaven.

[...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V.

The band referred to the bridge in [...] "Since You're Gone" [...] as the [...] "Beatles bridge" [...] because it was [...] "very unlike us," [...] according to Lazzara.
