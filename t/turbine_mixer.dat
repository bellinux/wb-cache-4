40|$|Aeration (To supply or charge with air) is a unit-operation to {{be widely}} used in {{disposition}} of city sewerage and aerobic biological disposition of organic plant wastewater. There are three forms in aeration，they are surface mixer aeration and air bubbles aeration and <b>turbine</b> <b>mixer</b> aeration. We perceived the flow in the aeration vessels with suface mixer and measured circulation time about various type's vessels and we got distributions of circulation time. And we used photographic method for determination circulation time. For this，we set inspecting section，which was illustrated in this paper，then catched the change of {{the brightness of the}} tracer between the bright section and the dark section.

40|$|Uranium as U(IV) and U(VI) can be {{selectively}} {{recovered from}} liquids and sludge containing metal precipitates, inorganic salts, {{sand and silt}} fines, debris, other contaminants, and slimes, which {{are very difficult to}} de-water. Chemical processes such as fuel manufacturing and uranium mining generate enriched and natural uranium-bearing wastes. This patented Framatome ANP (FANP) uranium recovery process reduces uranium losses, significantly offsets waste disposal costs, produces a solid waste that meets mixed-waste disposal requirements, and does not generate metal-contaminated liquids. At the head end of the process is a floating dredge that retrieves liquids, sludge, and slimes {{in the form of a}} slurry directly from the floor of a lined surface impoundment (lagoon). The slurry is transferred to and mixed in a feed tank with a <b>turbine</b> <b>mixer</b> and re-circulated to further break down the particles and enhance dissolution of uranium. This process uses direct steam injection and sodium hypochlorite addition to oxidize and dissolves any U(IV). Cellulose is added as a non-reactive filter aid to help filter slimes by giving body to the slurry. The slurry is pumped into a large recessed-chamber filter press then de-watered by a pressure cycle-controlled double-diaphragm pump. U(VI) captured in the filtrate from this process is then precipitated by conversion to U(IV) in another Framatome ANP-patented process which uses a strong reducing agent to crystallize and settle the U(IV) product. The product is then dewatered in a small filter press. To-date, over 3, 000 Kgs of U at 3 % U- 235 enrichment were recovered from a 8100 m 2 hypalon-lined surface impoundment which contained about 10, 220 m 3 of liquids and about 757 m 3 of sludge. A total of 2, 175 drums (0. 208 m 3 or 55 gallon each) of solid mixed-wastes have been packaged, shipped, and disposed. In addition, 9463 m 3 of low-U liquids at < 0. 001 KgU/m 3 were also further processed and disposed...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} ensure the {{effective}} operation of the casting line, synthetic sand containing bentonite has to be fed in a precisely controlled quality and quantity. The required quantity is ensured by mixing stations outfitted with <b>turbine</b> <b>mixers.</b> The quality of sand mix, defined by its technological parameters, depends on the available measurement and control equipment and the system controlling the mixers’ operation.

40|$|<b>Turbine</b> (rotor) <b>mixers</b> {{are widely}} used in {{foundries}} for bentonite rebonding of synthetic system sands. They form basic equipment in modern sand processing plants. Their major advantage is the short time of the rebond mixing cycle. Until now, no complete theoretical description {{of the process of}} mixing in <b>turbine</b> <b>mixers</b> has been offered. Neither does it seem reasonable to try to adapt the theoretical backgrounds of the mixing process carried out in mixers of other types, for example, rooler mixers [1], to the description of operation of the <b>turbine</b> <b>mixers.</b> Truly one can risk the statement that the individual fundamental operations of mixing in rooler mixers, like kneading, grinding, mixing and thinning, are also performed in <b>turbine</b> <b>mixers.</b> Yet, even if so, in <b>turbine</b> <b>mixers</b> these processes are proceeding at a rate and intensity different than in the roller mixers. The fact should also be recalled that the theoretical backgrounds usually relate to the preparation of sand mixtures from new components, and this considerably restricts the field of application of these descriptions when referred to rebond mixing of the system sand. The fundamentals of the process of the synthetic sand rebonding with bentonite require determination and description of operations, like disaggregation, even distribution of binder and water within the entire volume of the rebonded sand batch, sand grains coating, binder activation and aeration. This study presents the scope of research on the sand rebonding process carried out in <b>turbine</b> <b>mixers.</b> The aim has been to determine the range and specific values of the designing and operating parameters to get optimum properties of the rebonded sand as well as energy input in the process...|$|R

40|$|The {{influences}} {{of the main}} factors on the mixing efficiency and distribution for a bioreactor with stirred/mobile bed of immobilized S. cerevisiae cells in alginate (biocatalyst particles with 4, 4. 6 and 5. 2 mm diameters) have been comparatively analyzed for six radial impellers: a disperser sawtooth, Smith <b>turbine,</b> a pumper <b>mixer,</b> a curved bladed turbine, a paddle with six blades, a pitched bladed turbine vs. Rushton turbine.

40|$|Mechanical seals have {{increasingly}} {{been used for}} sealing rotating shafts in centrifugal pumps, propeller shafts in ships and submarines, compressors, liquid propellant rocket motors in aerospace industry, pumps, <b>turbines,</b> <b>mixers</b> and many other rotating machines during last two decades. Abnormal operating conditions in the mechanical seals will degrade machine performance, increase operating cost and may cause unexpected sudden failures which are dangerous in both engineering and safety terms. Hence {{it is necessary to}} investigate the tribological behaviour of mechanical seals operating based on nonlinear coupling between fluid and surface dynamics, in order to develop more advanced diagnostic technologies to improve the reliability of such machines operating with mechanical seals. Different condition monitoring techniques have been studied to evaluate the lubrication state and severity of contact between the mating faces in mechanical seals. However, some of them are not cost effective others are not practical in industrial applications. Acoustic emission (AE) has been proved to be a sensitive indicator of lubrication conditions and changes in the lubricant properties, however the application of technique for identification of lubrication regimes in mechanical seals has not been reported yet. Moreover, previous studies give relatively little information to acoustic emission condition monitoring of mechanical seals, nor has comprehensive fault detection been implemented for a particular case. In addition, a review on previous works reveals the lack of comprehensive mathematical models to explain the relationship between AE energy and tribological characteristics of the mating faces under healthy and faulty conditions. In this research, the tribological behaviour of mechanical seals is investigated using acoustic emission measurements to pave a way for fault detection at early stage. Three common seal failures i. e. dry running, spring fault, and defective seal are studied in this thesis. The main objective is to extract AE features that can explain the tribological behaviour of mechanical seals under both healthy and faulty conditions. To achieve this, a purpose-built test rig was employed for collecting AE signals from the mechanical seals. Then, the collected data was processed using time domain, frequency domain and time frequency domain analysis methods which are of the most common techniques used for monitoring in AE applications. Based on results the main frequency band that can present the tribological behaviour of mechanical seals was detected. Also it has been proved that AE features in time domain and frequency domain can be effectively applied to indicate the lubrication condition of mechanical seals as well as early fault detection. Moreover, mathematical models were developed to establish a relationship between AE root mean square (RMS) value of AE signals and working parameters of seals (rotational speed, load and number of asperities in contact) under different lubrication regimes. A good agreement was achieved between measured and predicted signals that gives a good evidence of the effectiveness of proposed models. Especially in case of leakage {{that is one of the}} main situations indicating the seal failure, a significant difference was observed between the predicted signal for healthy case and the measured signal under faulty conditions. Therefore, it can be deduced that the AE measurement system and signal processing developed in this work has a promising potential to be used to diagnose and monitor the mechanical seals online. Finally, the conclusions and achievements are given based on the entirety of this research work, and online monitoring incorporating with AE features and mathematical models developed in this thesis are suggested as the main works for further research...|$|R
40|$|Carbonate {{scale is}} a common problem found in a piping system of {{industrial}} process. The presence of mechanical equipment such as <b>turbine,</b> compressor, blower, <b>mixer</b> and extruder produce a mechanical vibration on the piping system which is placed near these equipments. The influence of vibration on the CaCO 3 scale formation in the piping system was experimentally investigated in the present study. The {{aim of the research}} was to understand the effect of vibration on the kinetics, deposition rates and the crystals formation in the synthetic solution. The solution was prepared using CaCl 2 and Na 2 CO 3 for concentration of calcium of 3. 500 ppm, while the induction time, deposition rate, crystal growth were investigated at temperature of 25 °C. In generating the vibration force, the mechanical equipment consisting of electrical motor, crankshaft, connecting rod and a vibration table were employed, including four coupons inside the pipe for investigating the scale formed. Frequency of the vibration was set at 0. 00, 1. 00 Hz and 2. 00 Hz, respectively. A dosing pump with two inlets and two outlets was used to circulate the solutions at flowrate of 30 ml/min from each vessel to the coupons. After running for three hours, the induction time was recorded at 17; 10 and 8 minute with vibration frequency of 0. 00; 1. 00 and 2. 00 Hz, respectively. The scale formed was then characterized using SEM/EDX for crystal morphology and elemental analysis.
