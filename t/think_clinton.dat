[...] "I don't {{suppose he}} could make {{his way down the}} Nile, {{although}} he might do that; but there are several caravan routes down to the Red Sea, and then there is Abyssinia. The people are Christians there, and, they say, fighting against the Mahdi's Arabs now; so if he got there he would be pretty sure to be treated well. I should say that there were lots of ways that he could escape. I don't mean now; but when he has got accustomed to the country, it seems to me a fellow with pluck and energy such as he has got ought to find no great difficulty in giving the people he is with the slip, and making his way somewhere. I do <b>think,</b> <b>Clinton,</b> there is no occasion to feel hopeless about your brother. It may {{be a long time before}} you see him again, but I do honestly believe he will turn up some time or other." ...|$|E

"I <b>think,</b> <b>Clinton,</b> {{that were}} I in your place I {{should go to}} the {{commanding}} officer and tell him you have learnt that the trumpeter who was with the wounded sergeant of the Heavies found in the grove, and who left him to fetch aid from our camp, was your brother. You can say that on account of a misunderstanding he left home and enlisted under a false name, and beg that a search be instituted for his body, and also that the politicals who are in communication with the natives should make inquiries whether any white captive had been brought into Metemmeh. If you like I will say as much to our colonel, and I am sure that he will give orders that whenever detachments go out strict search will be made of all ground over which they pass. I am afraid that if we do learn from the natives that he is at Metemmeh our chance of getting him back before we take the place is small, for even if the people into whose hands he fell were willing to part with him for a ransom, the fanatical dervishes would not allow it; however, there would be no harm in trying. I know that to-day half a dozen natives came in with some cattle and grain, and no doubt some others will be in to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|What Rupert {{had said}} was {{explained}} to the sheik, who, although he showed little outward satisfaction, was evidently pleased {{with the prospect of}} some day owning the two fast camels. There was now a long discussion between Major Kitchener and the sheik as to the best route to be pursued, and the probabilities as to the course that Edgar's captors had followed, and then the conference broke up, the sheik saying his camels required another two days' rest, and that on the third day at daybreak he should be ready to start. At the last moment Rupert suggested, that as the Arabs had, they said, two spare camels before, and would now have three, he should present them with a sufficient load of rugs, powder, and other things they valued to form light loads for the three spare animals. There would be nothing suspicious in their possessing such goods, as many of the loaded camels had, especially on the night march to Metemmeh, strayed away or fallen, and their loads had been plundered by the Arabs. For twenty pounds he could get from the quarter-master's stores plenty of goods for the purpose, and as these could be used for barter it would obviate the necessity of carrying silver. The offer added to the good temper of the sheik and his followers, and as Rupert walked back to Major Kitchener's tent with him the latter said, [...] "I <b>think,</b> <b>Clinton,</b> you have won your fellows fairly over. I could see by the way they discussed the routes to be followed, that they have got thoroughly interested in the matter themselves, and will throw themselves heartily into it. I really think you have a very fair chance of getting through this business safely. I did not think so when you first proposed it to me, but the difficulties seem to have disappeared as we have gone on; and now that I have seen you in disguise, I think that, unless from some unforeseen accident, or some forgetfulness on your own part, {{there is no reason why}} you should not travel with those Arabs from end to end of the Soudan." ...|$|E

Time, CBS News, CNN, the Wall Street Journal and the Christian Science Monitor ran stories questioning whether there really was a health care crisis. Op-eds were written against it, including one in The Washington Post by conservative University of Virginia Professor Martha Derthick that said, In many years of studying American social policy, I have never read an official document that seemed so suffused with coercion and political naivete... with its drastic prescriptions for controlling the conduct of state governments, employers, drug manufacturers, doctors, hospitals and you and me.

50|$|Extracts {{from the}} first book of his Erythraean Sea, written {{in the first person}} and advocating a {{military}} campaign into the lands south of Egypt, led early scholars to deduce that Agatharchides was an important political figure of his time, and served as a guardian to one of the sons of Ptolemy VIII. Dodwell endeavored to show that it the younger son, Alexander, and objects to Soter, that he reigned conjointly with his mother. This, however, was the case with Alexander likewise. Wesseling and Henry Fynes <b>Clinton</b> <b>think</b> the elder brother to be the one meant, for Soter was {{more likely to have been}} a minor on his accession in 117 BC than Alexander in 107 BC, ten years after their father's death; the second edition of the Oxford Classical Dictionary article on Agatharchides agrees that the son was Soter. Moreover, Dodwell's date would leave too short an interval between the publication of Agatharchides's work on the Erythraean Sea (about 113 BC), and the work of Artemidorus. However at least as early as 1810, when B. G. Niebuhr pointed out that these excerpts were from a speech, and not part of the narrative of his book, this theory has been recognized as conflicting with other known historical facts.|$|R

ATHENS, Ga. - When historians {{analyze the}} {{presidency}} of Bill Clinton, will impeachment mar his legacy? While admitting he 2 ̆ 7 s no prophet, University of Georgia law and history professor Ed Larson, winner of the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for history, shares ideas. 2 ̆ 2 Andrew Johnson tried hard to redeem himself, 2 ̆ 2 Larson says. 2 ̆ 2 He eventually {{went back to the}} Senate from Tennessee and viewed that as a tremendous vindication. The question is how much does <b>Clinton</b> <b>think</b> he needs to be redeemed? He can look to the public opinion polls, which still show him as popular. He may not feel the need to be redeemed in history because he may not think it 2 ̆ 7 s that bad a blot. 2 ̆ 2 And historians may not either. While Larson acknowledges that impeachment will be of historical importance, he believes historians will paint Clinton 2 ̆ 7 s presidency with broad strokes and consider other factors: the breakdown of discourse among party lines, the influence of politicians such as Newt Gingrich, the scandal-driven media, and a loss of historical perspective. Historians do not look favorably upon Johnson, the only other U. S. president ever impeached, but Larson says that 2 ̆ 7 s as much a denouncement of his politics as it is the legacy of impeachment. A more apt parallel for Clinton, Larson believes, is Grover Cleveland, a very popular Democrat who survived sex scandals and served two presidential terms. 2 ̆ 2 It 2 ̆ 7 s been joked that Grover was the best Republican in the period of the 1890 s, because even though he was a Democrat, he had Republican policies, 2 ̆ 2 Larson says. 2 ̆ 2 We could say the same of Bill Clinton - he 2 ̆ 7 s the best Republican president of the late 1900 s. And Cleveland is not one of our more remembered presidents. He tends to be a forgotten president, despite serving in office for a long time. 2 ̆ 2 And because many Americans wish the impeachment affair could be forgotten, Larson says the Senate trial will not measure up to previous courtroom dramas as another 2 ̆ 2 trial of the century. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 I don 2 ̆ 7 t think people will be glued to their sets as they were for the O. J. Simpson trial or glued to their radios and newspapers as in the Scopes trial, 2 ̆ 2 says Larson. 2 ̆ 2 I think the media think they should cover it and they think it 2 ̆ 7 s the best story they 2 ̆ 7 ve got, but it 2 ̆ 7 s not a story that will capture the interest of the people. I think they 2 ̆ 7 ll be more interested in the Super Bowl and other activities that are happening. 2 ̆ 2 Larson joined UGA 2 ̆ 7 s law and history faculties in 1987. He received the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for his book, Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America 2 ̆ 7 s Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion. He may be reached at 706 / 542 - 2660...|$|R
