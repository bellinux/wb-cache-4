5|$|The next day, Rosie and Aldermach {{announce}} {{that they have}} given birth to Callie's sister, Lilith. Thanks to the hormone injections Rosie has had, it only took a day for Lilith to be born and she will age one year, every day, and take Callie's place as Twayne's bride. After an accident caused by Lilith, Rosie is hospitalized and Mark and Callie <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> to raise Lilith. In just a few weeks, she is eighteen years old and has started dating Randall. Mark takes in Twayne for a session and finds out about his arranged marriage to Lilith, and that the marriage will be a televised sex ritual. Callie realizes that she is forcing Lilith to marry Twayne, just like her father forced her, and tells Lilith {{that she does not}} want her to marry him. Lilith, however, wants to the opposite of what Callie wants and tells her that she will marry him. Just before the ritual is about to commence, Lilith reveals to Mark that she plots to kill Callie and Twayne and instead join Mark at the sex altar. Mark informs Callie, who takes out her soul to transform into a more demonic figure. Following a battle between the two, Lilith falls down to a lower level of Hell. Later, Callie kicks Mark out of her apartment as she does not have to marry Twayne anymore.|$|E
25|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} {{is important}} because it allows an individual to adapt to a changing environment and can ultimately alter their evolutionary path. It not only plays an indirect role in defense as individuals prepare themselves physically to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> of avoiding predation through camouflage or developing collective mechanical traits to protect a social hive, but also a direct one. For example, cues elicited from a predator, which may be visual, acoustic, chemical, or vibrational, may cause rapid responses that alter the prey’s phenotype in real time.|$|E

He was elected Curule aedile in 201 BC, and in 199 BC, he served as Praetor urbanus. In the {{following}} year (198 BC), his praetorial imperium was prorogued by the Senate, initially to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> of allocating land in Italy for veterans who had served in Hispania.

500|$|Wiesenthal {{worked for}} the American Office of Strategic Services for a year, and {{continued}} to collect information on both victims and perpetrators of the Holocaust. He assisted the Berihah, an underground organisation that smuggled Jewish survivors into the British Mandate for Palestine. Wiesenthal helped arrange for forged papers, food supplies, transportation, and so on. In February 1947, he and 30 other volunteers founded the Jewish Documentation Center in Linz to gather information for future war crimes trials. They collected 3,289 depositions from concentration camp survivors still living in Europe. However, as the US and the Soviet Union lost interest in conducting further trials, a similar group headed by Tuviah Friedman in Vienna closed its office in 1952, and Wiesenthal's closed in 1954. Almost all of the documentation collected at both centres was forwarded to the Yad Vashem archives in Israel. Wiesenthal, employed full-time by two Jewish welfare agencies, continued his work with refugees. As {{it became clear that}} the former Allies were no longer interested in pursuing the work of bringing Nazi war criminals to justice, Wiesenthal persisted, believing the survivors were obligated to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>task.</b> His work became a way to memorialise and remember all the people that had been lost. He told biographer Alan Levy in 1974: ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars the Russian economy, {{ravaged by}} the Continental System and Napoleon's invasion, slid into a {{continuous}} economic crisis. Grain exports were high in 1816–1817, but in 1818–1819 Western European crops recovered and Russian exports plummeted. Landed gentry tried to restore lost income through enclosures and driving away redundant serf peasants, but Alexander outlawed [...] "emancipation" [...] of serfs without land. Economic downfall fuelled radical opposition inside Russian nobility: [...] "it was Alexander's failures to live up to their hopes that led them to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> to themselves".|$|E

2500|$|Official {{action was}} not taken until 1808, after Virginia {{became part of}} the United States, when the Virginia General Assembly tasked William Waller Hening with the {{publication}} of the state's laws. [...] His thirteen volume Statutes at Large (1809–23) was not comprehensive due to the loss of many records, but included all the session laws Hening could find dating from 1619 to 1792, as well as royal charters.

2500|$|The first {{recorded}} attempts {{to improve the}} upper river for navigation occurred in 1567 and 1606, when the people of Northampton commissioned surveys. In 1653, a printed pamphlet suggested that 33 locks to bypass the mills could be built for £8,000, to make the river navigable. Eventually, an Act of Parliament was obtained in 1713, which appointed large numbers of Commissioners, but stated that work could only proceed if any nine of them could find someone to make the entire [...] river navigable. No-one was prepared to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>task,</b> although it appears from the Act that the river was navigable from Peterborough to Alwalton at the time. The Act was superseded by a second one obtained in 1724, which allowed the river to be improved in stages, the work {{to be carried out}} at the contractor's expense, with the cost to be recouped from tolls. Robert Wright and Thomas Squire agreed to these terms for the section from Peterborough to the bridge at Oundle North in September 1726, and completed the work by 1730. Squire then agreed to the same terms for the next section to Thrapston in 1736, and completed it by late 1737. This part of the river was then designated as the Eastern Division.|$|E
