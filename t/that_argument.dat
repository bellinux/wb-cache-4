5|$|Some experts {{argue that}} exposing {{children}} to television {{at such an}} early age is taking technology too far or that parents are using BabyFirst as a digital babysitter. Parents in-turn refute <b>that</b> <b>argument,</b> claiming that experts have lost touch {{with the realities of}} raising a child. BabyFirst suggests the programming is intended to be watched by parents and their children together in an interactive way. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against exposing {{children under the age of}} two to television, while a 2003 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that most children under two years of age are already watching TV. According to The Washington Post, very little is known about whether young children watching television has a negative or positive effect on them.|$|E
5|$|The Attorney General of Virginia, Mary Sue Terry, prosecuted eight LaRouche {{organizations}} {{on charges}} of securities fraud relating to $30million in loans. The first trials were in Leesburg, but later trials moved to the larger city of Roanoke. In order for the prosecutions to proceed, {{a decision by the}} State Corporation Commission (SCC) was needed verifying that the loans solicited by LaRouche organizations were securities. Attorneys for the LaRouche organizations argued that a prohibition on raising funds through loans would violate their First Amendment rights. The SCC rejected <b>that</b> <b>argument</b> and decided, on March 4, 1987, that the promissory notes were securities. It ordered six LaRouche organizations—Fusion Energy Foundation Inc., Caucus Distributors Inc., Publication and General Management Inc., Campaigner Publications Inc., EIR News Service Inc. and Publication Equities Inc.—to stop their sale. Five other states had already issued injunctions, and 14 states eventually followed. At least one injunction, by the State of Minnesota against Independent Democrats for LaRouche, was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which confirmed the lower court ruling.|$|E

40|$|Argument-based formalisms {{are gaining}} {{popularity}} as models of nonmonotonic reasoning. Central in such formalisms is {{a notion of}} argument. Arguments are formal reconstructions of how a conclusion is supported. Generally, an argument is defeasible. This means <b>that</b> an <b>argument</b> supporting a conclusion does not always justify its conclusion: the argument can be defeated. Whether a conclusion supported by an argument is justified depends {{on the structure of}} the argument and on the other arguments available. In this paper, we argue for four points that are refinements of how arguments and defeat have been used in argument-based nonmonotonic reasoning. First we argue <b>that</b> an <b>argument</b> can be defeated because it contains a weak sequence of steps; second <b>that</b> <b>arguments</b> accrue, which means <b>that</b> <b>arguments</b> for a conclusion reinforce each other; third that defeat can be compound, which means <b>that</b> groups of <b>arguments</b> can defeat other groups of arguments; fourth <b>that</b> defeated <b>arguments</b> mu [...] ...|$|R
