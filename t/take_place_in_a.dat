5|$|Airport runways {{are also}} de-iced by {{sprayers}} fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are {{wide enough to}} cross the entire runway, and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip to <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single pass, reducing {{the length of time}} that the runway is unavailable.|$|E

Smelting, using carbon to reduce iron oxides, results in an alloy (pig iron) that retains too much carbon to be called steel. The excess carbon and other impurities are removed in a subsequent step.|$|E

5|$|After {{defeating}} the eight Robot Masters, the player proceeds to Dr. Wily's fortress, {{which consists of}} six levels that are played linearly. As in the first title, the player is required to fight each Robot Master a second time in Dr. Wily's fortress. However, these battles <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single room rather than a series of linearly connected rooms. The room contains teleportation devices that lead to each Robot Master. The devices can be entered in any order, but are not labeled. Once the bosses are defeated again, the player must fight Dr. Wily.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft deicing {{vehicles}} {{have also}} improved since the accident, usually {{consisting of a}} large tanker truck, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a cherry picker crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire Boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle. Airport runways are also deiced by sprayers fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are wide enough to cross the entire runway, and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip to <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single pass, reducing {{the length of time}} that the runway is unavailable.|$|E

In the demo, some wall graffiti directly alludes to P.T. by repeating a statement made in the game. The Park, a spin-off game from The Secret World, has a sequence inspired by P.T., and the horror game Layers of Fear was heavily inspired by P.T. as well.|$|E
5|$|Dark Forces is a first-person shooter (FPS). The player {{controls}} Kyle Katarn from a first-person perspective, with a {{focus on}} combat against various creatures and characters from the Star Wars universe, although the game also includes environmental puzzles and hazards. Dark Forces follows a central storyline outlined in mission briefings and cutscenes. Each mission includes specific objectives which are related to the story. The missions <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> variety of environments across the Star Wars universe, including a Star Destroyer interior, Jabba the Hutt's space yacht, and the planet Coruscant, where the player must infiltrate a computer vault.|$|E
5|$|Portland is {{an ancient}} royal manor, and until the 19th century {{remained}} a separate liberty within Dorset for administration purposes. It was an urban district from 1894 to 1974, until the borough of Weymouth and Portland formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. This merged the borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis with Portland urban district. For local elections the borough is divided into 15 wards, and three of them cover Portland. Elections <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> four-year cycle; {{one third of the}} councillors in all but three wards retire or seek re-election in years one, two and three, and county council elections are held in year four.|$|E

5|$|Principal filming {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia, with the crash scene being filmed on an old airport space with flat roads. However, other key {{sequences}} occurred in the studio. Because the fight scene between the Winchesters and Azazel at the climax was meant to <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> secluded, forest-enclosed cabin, production built the set on a sound stage. Production designer Jerry Wanek felt the set was extremely important, as viewers would become uninterested if the forest looked fake. With Morgan rendered blind by the yellow contact lenses required to depict his character's demonic possession, the production crew placed sandbags {{on the floor to}} help the actor locate his marks.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} of Weymouth and Portland was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and merged the borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis {{and the nearby}} Portland urban district. For local elections the district is divided into 15 wards, 12 of them in Weymouth. Elections <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> four-year cycle; {{one third of the}} councillors in all but three wards retire or seek re-election in years one, two and three, and county council elections are held in year four. The Mayor of Weymouth and Portland is Kevin Brookes (Conservative), _________ (Labour Party) is Deputy Mayor.|$|E
5|$|The rugby {{competition}} {{took place}} in a temporary arena at Deodoro Stadium. The original plan was to stage the rugby matches at the São Januário Stadium. However this was scrapped because the club in charge of the venue missed the deadline to present its project. The Organising Committee considered Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, which would have had to have been shared with the athletics competitions. It was later announced that the rugby competition will <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> temporary arena at Deodoro Stadium, shared with the modern pentathlon. In April 2016 concerns were raised by the World Rugby head of competitions and performance, Mark Egan, about progress of construction at the temporary 15,000-seater stadium.|$|E

5|$|Battles are {{triggered}} {{when the}} player encounters an enemy in the overworld. Battles <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> themed arena, using {{a version of}} the Active Time Battle system: each side is given a turn in which to perform an action such as attacking. Each side can also interrupt an opponent's action, prolonging their waiting time. At the end of battle, players are granted experience points, which raise their experience level and boost their maximum health and statistics, in addition to in-game currency. Players can form a three-strong party to fight monsters, explore and battle alone, or loan non-active player characters of a similar or lower experience level for a fee, which are then controlled in battle by the game's artificial intelligence. Any character can be loaned to three different people, and the loaned character keeps the experience points and gold that they have earned.|$|E
5|$|Directors of {{the series}} include Gore Verbinski (1–3), Rob Marshall(4) and Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg (5). The series is {{primarily}} written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (1–4); other writers include Stuart Beattie (1), Jay Wolpert (1) and Jeff Nathanson (5). The stories follow the adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). Characters such as Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally) follow Jack, Will and Elizabeth {{in the course of}} the films. The fourth film features Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and Angelica (Penélope Cruz), while the fifth film features Armando Salazar (Javier Bardem), Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) and Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario). The films <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fictional historical setting; a world ruled by the British Empire, the East India Trading Company (based on the real East India Company) and the Spanish Empire, with pirates representing freedom from the ruling powers.|$|E
5|$|In Britain gay saunas were {{routinely}} raided by police {{up until the}} end of the 1980s (for example raids in May 1988 on Brownies in Streatham, the owner getting a six-month jail sentence and a £5,000 fine, and the Brooklyn House Hotel sauna in Manchester). By the 1990s, with increasing scrutiny of the costs of such operations (charges of gross indecency in a sauna normally needing the expense of undercover officers), a reduced likelihood of successful prosecution, concerns of being perceived as homophobic, and little public interest in victimless crime, gay saunas became free to operate without the risk of being raided by police. Also, police attitudes meant that they were more willing to turn a blind eye because they preferred such activity to <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> contained environment rather than outdoors even though users were still committing the homosexual sexual offence of gross indecency, until gross indecency was wiped from the statute books following the Sexual Offences Act 2003.|$|E

5|$|Like most shooter games, first-person {{shooters}} involve an avatar, {{one or more}} ranged weapons, and a varying {{number of}} enemies. Because they <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 3D environment, these games tend to be somewhat more realistic than 2D shooter games, and have more accurate representations of gravity, lighting, sound and collisions. First-person shooters played on personal computers are most often controlled {{with a combination of}} a keyboard and mouse. This system has been claimed as superior to that found in console games, which frequently use two analog sticks: one used for running and sidestepping, the other for looking and aiming. It is common to display the character's hands and weaponry in the main view, with a head-up display showing health, ammunition and location details. Often, it is possible to overlay a map of the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|Metal Gear is a stealth action {{video game}} series created by Hideo Kojima and {{developed}} {{and published by}} Konami. The series debuted in Japan on July 12, 1987 with Metal Gear {{and is one of}} Konami's best-selling franchises, with over 26.5 million units sold. The games <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> semi-fictional universe with stories that involve a special forces agent (Solid Snake in most games) who is forced to destroy the latest incarnation of the superweapon Metal Gear, as well as having to rescue various hostages and neutralize certain renegade units in the process. Metal Gear titles have been released on numerous video game consoles, handheld game consoles, and personal computer platforms. Related novels, comics, and other dramatizations have also been released. A few of the series' main characters have also appeared in other Konami games.|$|E
