5000|$|The {{original}} nine cottages on {{the western}} shoreline faced the larger part of the lake which provided evening sunset views. The largest cottage was Number 3 and the smallest was Number 8. Cottage number 4 was the original home of Joseph and Margaret Cain, who became the first proprietors of the general store. Number 8 was also referred to a [...] "the fisherman's cabin" [...] and was moved to its lakeside location after being purchased for $25. These original cottages were supplied with coal oil stoves and ice boxes. Cottages numbers 10-15 were not located on the water. Numbers ten through twelve were all relocated farm housed from various nearby locations that were purchased and moved into place. Cottage number 10 sufficed as the general store after the fire for a few years. Cottage 13 was renamed [...] "Mir-a-Mar" [...] after the Daytona Beach resort visited by Tom O'Connor (son of John O'Connor referenced above) in 1944. The number 13 was not used so the superstitious would not be deterred from renting the unit. Cottages fourteen and fifteen were originally built as a single livery stable for horses visitors who arrived by horse and buggy. In 1929, cottages 16-20 were added. Stone was brought from Northwood Quarry via Ford Model T trucks. Cottage #17 was initially located along the western shoreline, but was moved to its location beside the marina. A well was drilled near the front step of cottage 20 and an electric pump was installed to supply drinking water <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> lavatory. The last expansion phase of cottages added numbers 21 through 30 in 1949. They were placed in a fashion that hugged the lawn and lake in front of them, where a playground would be located. Each was constructed with cinder block and number 30 had hardwood flooring. These 10 cottages cost $48,000 to build and {{in the summer of}} 1950, began renting for $60/week. Cottage number 20 is the lone remaining O'Connor's Landing cottage and is privately owned.|$|E

If a node has neighbors {{closer to the}} sink, GEAR will choose among these neighbors {{the one with the}} smallest weighted sum of the distance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> the energy consumed as the next forwarding node; otherwise, the neighbor with the smallest weighted sum is the next forwarding node.|$|E

In 1902 the shaft cut the Golden Gate reef at 480 feet and they sunk an underlie for 142 feet however the reef was not payable and the straight shaft was the outlet for the water.

40|$|Wireless Sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{are used}} to monitor and control the physical environment in different classes of applications. Due to the dense deployment of sensors and as the sensor observations are spatially correlated with respect to location of sensor nodes, {{it is not necessary}} for every sensor to transmit its data. Therefore, because the resource constraints of nodes, it is necessary to select the minimum number of nodes to transmit the data <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> hence minimize the energy consumption. In this paper we develop a new scheme using the energy–aware immune system and this method selects the minimum number of designated nodes that can send its data <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> significantly reduce the energy consumption. In addition, considering the remaining energy of the designated nodes, their energy is balanced.
