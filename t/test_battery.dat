The DAS-II is a <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> given individually to children, normed for children from ages two years and six months through seventeen years and eleven months. It was normed on 3,480 noninstitutionalized, English-speaking children in that age range. The DAS-II yields a General Conceptual Ability (GCA) score scaled like an IQ score with the median standard score set at 100 and 15 standard score points for each standard deviation up or down from the median. The lowest possible GCA score on DAS–II is 44, and the highest is 175.|$|E

A ciphering process used to encrypt a message is mainly based on the cryptographic random numbers. There are numerous methods proposed to generate random numbers for cryptographic applications in the literature. To decide whether a cryptographic random number generator is suitable for cryptographic applications or not, various statistical randomness tests are introduced. In practice, <b>test</b> <b>batteries</b> that contain more than one randomness test are constructed and all the <b>tests</b> in a <b>battery</b> are applied to evaluate the quality of random number generator.

25|$|The Benton Test is {{sensitive}} to many forms of brain impairments and diseases, {{but it is difficult}} to diagnose a particular disease through the test. In fact, according to the test manual, a high number of a single category of error should not be used as a diagnosis, but should lead to further testing. High amounts of perseverations, for example, suggests frontal lobe damage, while the omission of peripheral designs suggests potential brain trauma, especially in the right parietal lobe. Overall performance does not seem to distinguish those with unilateral left or right hemisphere damage. Nevertheless, examiners have shown to be able to discriminate among perceptual, memory, and motor impairments based on analysis of the test results. Dementia, brain lesions, thalamic stroke, and Alzheimer's disease are among the afflictions that have been shown to greatly reduce an individual's BVRT score. Both the copy and memory versions of the test are especially sensitive to dementia, and may help identify individuals who are at risk for developing Alzheimer's later. In addition, learning disabilities among children are able to be identified through the Benton Test. In 1983, the Benton Test was included in the Neurobehavioral Core <b>Test</b> <b>Battery</b> (NCTB) to identify the effects of chemical exposure on the nervous system and has since been used to assess chemical exposure in the workplace. From its use in the NCTB, the Benton Test has shown sensitivity to various chemical exposures, including mercury exposure, lead exposure, and pesticide exposure.|$|E

2500|$|The British {{psychologist}} Charles Spearman in 1904 {{made the}} first formal factor analysis of correlations between the tests. He observed that children's school grades across seemingly unrelated school subjects were positively correlated, and reasoned that these correlations reflected the influence of an underlying general mental ability that entered into performance {{on all kinds of}} mental tests. He suggested that all mental performance could be conceptualized in terms of a single general ability factor and a large number of narrow task-specific ability factors. Spearman named it g for [...] "general factor" [...] and labeled the specific factors or abilities for specific tasks s. In any collection of test items that make up an IQ test, the score that best measures g is the composite score that has the highest correlations with all the item scores. Typically, the [...] "g-loaded" [...] composite score of an IQ <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> appears to involve a common strength in abstract reasoning across the test's item content.

40|$|Introduction The MOBAK- 1 <b>testing</b> <b>battery</b> {{has been}} {{recently}} developed {{with the aim}} of assessing the locomotion and object-control abilities of first grade children. Previous researches have demonstrated the global interest of this <b>testing</b> <b>battery</b> (1, 2). However, a critical analysis of children failures in the tests revealed that some failures were related to the misunderstanding of the instruction or to unsuitable criteria and not to children inability (2). Moreover, the discrimination of the scoring system was also questioned. The aim of the study is to improve criteria {{in order to avoid the}} failure that are not related to children ability and to compare the actual dichotomous scoring system with another scoring system taking in consideration the progression of the children. Methods The MOBAK- 1 <b>testing</b> <b>battery</b> will be addressed to 30 first grade children. Criteria for each test will be adapted according to previous observations (2) and will include familiarization with the task and additional trial when it is clear that the failure is not due to children ability. All the children will be assessed at the same time with the actual dichotomous scoring system and with an original scoring system that takes the children level of development into account. Results We hypothesized that the adaptation of the criteria will improve the <b>testing</b> <b>battery</b> discrimination. We also expected that the scoring system based on children progression will be more accurate but will be more difficult to be used by unexperienced teachers. Conclusion According to the results of the study, concrete improvements will be addressed to the researchers who work on MOBAK <b>testing</b> <b>battery</b> development. References 1.
