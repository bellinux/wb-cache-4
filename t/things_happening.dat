The diagrams do not imply that the particles are moving in straight or curved lines. They do not imply that the particles are moving with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight one does not imply that it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, somehow, move from point to point and electrons, somehow, emit and absorb photons. The theory does not explain how these things happen, but it does tell us the probabilities of these <b>things</b> <b>happening</b> in various situations.|$|E
5|$|Four months later, Dot is {{released}} and shares her regret with Ian {{that she did}} not report Nick's crimes earlier in life. Fatboy tells Dot he is spending Christmas with his father, but later Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) discovers Fatboy's belongings amongst some blood in the boot of a crushed car and tells Dot that Fatboy is not coming back because of a job abroad.

Dot and Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson) are involved in a car collision, but both blame the other as Kim has no licence but Kim accuses Dot of being too old to drive. Dot then locks her car key away. After Patrick and Dot go to the cinema together, he convinces her to see an optician because she was squinting throughout. Dot is seen hiding away in her house on Halloween and Patrick comes to talk to her. Dot says her hatred of Halloween is due to awful <b>things</b> <b>happening</b> on Halloween such as Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner) getting electrocuted and Max Branning (Jake Wood) getting run over. She then tries to read the Bible to Patrick but cannot see the words. Patrick tells her she isn't scared of Halloween but of the world. Dot reveals that she thinks she is going blind but then kicks Patrick out of the house. When he leaves, it is revealed that Dot cannot see anything clearly. Patrick books Dot a doctor's appointment; the doctor suspects age-related macular degeneration, which is later confirmed. Dot starts treatment but she is annoyed that her eyesight does not improve much. She turns down Ronnie's offer of paying for surgery to permanently fix her sight.|$|E
25|$|Along with asking moral questions, Slaughterhouse-Five {{is also a}} {{novel that}} focuses on the philosophies of fate and free will. In the novel, Billy Pilgrim tries to {{determine}} what his role in life is and what the purpose of everything going on around him is as well. When abducted by the Tralfamdorians, Pilgrim asks them why he is chosen among all the others. He questions the fate of the situation and what led up to that point. Billy Pilgrim considers his fate and actions {{to be a part of}} a larger network of actions, his future manipulated by one thing over another based on decision. All things that happen would happen for a reason. Indeed, Pilgrim’s beginning mindset would suggest that he believed in free will, fate, whys, decisions and <b>things</b> <b>happening</b> for reasons. However, many of these thoughts are quickly challenged by the Tralfamadorians' ideology.|$|E

An emergency C-section is performed, and their son Abel is delivered ten weeks prematurely. Jax finds his father's memoirs when he visits a storage unit to collect some old baby clothes.

500|$|While Chaplin's comedic {{style is}} broadly defined as slapstick, it is {{considered}} restrained and intelligent, with the film historian Philip Kemp describing {{his work as a}} mix of [...] "deft, balletic physical comedy and thoughtful, situation-based gags". Chaplin diverged from conventional slapstick by slowing the pace and exhausting each scene of its comic potential, with more focus on developing the viewer's relationship to the characters. Unlike conventional slapstick comedies, Robinson states that the comic moments in Chaplin's films centre on the Tramp's attitude to the <b>things</b> <b>happening</b> to him: the humour does not come from the Tramp bumping into a tree, but from his lifting his hat to the tree in apology. Dan Kamin writes that Chaplin's [...] "quirky mannerisms" [...] and [...] "serious demeanour in the midst of slapstick action" [...] are other key aspects of his comedy, while the surreal transformation of objects and the employment of in-camera trickery are also common features.|$|E

500|$|Cinematographer Janusz Kamiński {{shot the}} movie with {{high-speed}} film, which Spielberg preferred to the then-emerging digital video format. The movie's camera work is very mobile, alternating between handheld and Steadicam shots, which are [...] "exaggerated {{by the use}} of wide angle lenses and the occasional low camera angle" [...] to increase the perception of movement according to film scholar Warren Buckland. Kamiński said that he never used a lens longer than 27mm, and alternated between 17, 21, and 27mm lenses, as Spielberg liked to [...] "keep the actors as close to the camera as possible". He also said, [...] "We staged a lot of scenes in wide shots that have a lot of <b>things</b> <b>happening</b> with the frame." [...] The duo also used several long takes to focus on the emotions of the actors, rather than employing numerous cuts. Spielberg eschewed the typical [...] "shot reverse shot" [...] cinematography technique used when filming characters' interactions in favor of the long takes, which were shot by a mobile, probing camera. McDowell relied on colorless chrome and glass objects of curved and circular shapes in his set designs, which, aided by the [...] "low-key contrastive lighting", populated the film with shadows, creating a [...] "futuristic film noir atmosphere".|$|E
