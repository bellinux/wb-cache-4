5|$|In February 1999, David Protess, a Northwestern University journalism professor, and his {{students}} were studying cases of people on death row. They discovered evidence related <b>to</b> <b>Death</b> <b>Row</b> inmate Anthony Porter that might help exonerate him. The students produced four affidavits and a videotaped statement that attributed guilt for the crime to another suspect. They obtained recantations by some witnesses of their testimony at trial. One witness claimed that he named Anthony Porter as a suspect only after police officers threatened, harassed and intimidated him into doing so.|$|E
5|$|On December 5, 1989, Judge Roth found Taylor {{guilty of}} the first-degree child rape and first-degree murder of Charla Nicole King. During the penalty phase of Taylor's trial, his {{half-sister}} Leslie Beale traveled from Florida to testify about his harsh treatment under his stepfather and the three years that Taylor spent in a sex offender program at a Florida mental institution. On December 19, Taylor became the first convict in 40 years to be sent <b>to</b> <b>death</b> <b>row</b> by a Weber County court. Roth said that {{the facts of the}} case outweighed any mitigating circumstances. Taylor's father Albert attended most of his son's court proceedings until he died of heart failure on October 8, 1990. Taylor said he was not permitted to attend his father's funeral.|$|E
50|$|The act applied retroactively <b>to</b> persons on <b>death</b> <b>row,</b> {{of which}} {{there were more than}} 145 in the state.

25|$|On April 4, 2006 both Death Row Records and Suge Knight {{simultaneously}} {{filed for}} Chapter 11 Bank protection following {{the appointment of}} a Receiver to acquire and auction off assets of both Death Row Records and Suge Knight in the civil case filed by Lydia Harris against Suge Knight. Among those listed as unsecured creditors <b>to</b> <b>Death</b> <b>Row</b> include the Harris', the Internal Revenue Service ($6,900,000), Koch Records ($3,400,000), Interscope Records ($2,500,000) and a number of artists previously signed to the label. Suge Knight would eventually lose control of Death Row Records and his personal assets when Chapter 11 Trustees took over both cases.|$|E
25|$|On March 12, 2000, 60 Minutes aired an {{interview}} with Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. At the time, McVeigh had already been {{convicted and sentenced to}} death for the April 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and subsequent deaths of 168 people. On the program, McVeigh was given the opportunity to vent against the government. Following the program, a federal policy called the Special Confinement Unit Media Policy was enacted prohibiting face-to-face interviews with death row inmates. A federal inmate challenged the policy in Hammer v. Ashcroft, under which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the prison policy. In March 2010, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal in the case, and the policy limiting media access <b>to</b> <b>death</b> <b>row</b> inmates remains in place. CBS refuses to show the entire interview, and has stated no reasons.|$|E

25|$|On February 13, 1996, Shakur {{released}} his fourth solo album, All Eyez on Me. This double album {{was the first}} and second of his three-album commitment <b>to</b> <b>Death</b> <b>Row</b> Records. It sold more than nine million copies. The record was a general departure from the introspective subject matter of Me Against the World, being more oriented toward a thug and gangsta mentality. Shakur continued his recordings despite increasing problems at the Death Row label. Dr. Dre left his post as in-house producer to form his own label, Aftermath. Shakur continued to produce hundreds of tracks during his time at Death Row, most of which would be released on his posthumous albums Still I Rise, Until the End of Time, Better Dayz, Loyal to the Game and Pac's Life. He also began the process of recording an album, One Nation, with the New York-based Boot Camp Clik and their label Duck Down Records.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Miramax {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} two British films of benefit shows filmed for the human rights organization Amnesty International. Working closely with Martin Lewis, the producer of the original films, the Weinstein brothers edited the two films into one movie tailored for the American market. The resulting film was released as The Secret Policeman's Other Ball in May 1982, and it became Miramax's first hit. The movie raised considerable sums for Amnesty International and was credited by Amnesty with having helped to raise its profile in the United States.The Weinsteins slowly built upon this success throughout the 1980s with arthouse films that achieved critical attention and modest commercial success. Harvey Weinstein and Miramax gained wider attention in 1988 {{with the release of}} Errol Morris' documentary The Thin Blue Line, which detailed the struggle of Randall Adams, a wrongfully convicted inmate sentenced <b>to</b> <b>death</b> <b>row.</b> The publicity that soon surrounded the case resulted in Adams' release and nationwide publicity for Miramax. In 1989, their successful launch release of Steven Soderbergh's Sex, Lies, and Videotape propelled Miramax to become the most successful independent studio in America.|$|E
25|$|Torque {{heads back}} to Abbot {{by way of the}} beach, where he {{encounters}} Clem (Ross Douglas), an elderly inmate who {{was in the middle of}} an escape when the earthquake struck. Clem has a small one-person boat ready to sail, but needs Torque's help fighting creatures emerging from a wrecked slave ship before he can leave. Torque sets fire to the wreck, enabling Clem to escape. He enters Abbot's sewer system where he encounters Horace, who tells him Abbot wants his soul. He then heads to the electric chair, destroying it and releasing Horace's spirit. Returning <b>to</b> <b>death</b> <b>row,</b> he finds Killjoy's diagnosis, and then returns to the radio room. Successfully sending a signal, he learns a Coast Guard vessel is on the way. However, Carnate's lighthouse is not working, and must be reactivated before the vessel can approach the island. Torque heads to the lighthouse, passing through the old military barracks, Fort Maleson. In the fort, he encounters Hermes, who forces him to fight. Torque defeats him by using pressurized gas to push Hermes into a furnace. He continues to the lighthouse, outside of which he meets Ernesto Alverez, who is trying to find his family. They restore power, and reactivate the lighthouse, arranging to meet the ship at the dock.|$|E
50|$|Upon initial release, {{the rear}} artwork {{containing}} the track listing contained only the track titles and not performer names. Former <b>Death</b> <b>Row</b> producer Sam Sneed speculated {{that this was}} because most tracks featured Snoop Doggy Dogg and that by adding artist names to the track listing, Snoop's contribution <b>to</b> <b>Death</b> <b>Row's</b> catalogue was glaringly evident. Snoop had recently left <b>Death</b> <b>Row</b> Records, a move that label founder/CEO Suge Knight resented. The re-release distributed by Koch Records added the artist names to the track listing. Furthermore, singles and tracks from <b>Death</b> <b>Row's</b> more recent releases such as Snoop's Tha Doggfather and 2Pac's All Eyez on Me were not included, possibly as a move to counter cannibalisation of sales from the actual releases.|$|R
50|$|After the {{incident}} occurred, the TDCJ considered moving the <b>death</b> <b>row</b> for men, and the Terrell Unit was the favored {{choice for the}} relocation. According to the TDCJ, the prison escape attempt had hastened the agency's decision <b>to</b> move <b>death</b> <b>row</b> inmates <b>to</b> a new location. TDCJ officials also stated that overcrowding at Ellis was another factor in the <b>death</b> <b>row</b> move. Six months after the escape attempt, the TDCJ decided <b>to</b> move the <b>death</b> <b>row.</b> The Texas Coalition <b>to</b> Abolish the <b>Death</b> Penalty criticized the move of the <b>death</b> <b>row,</b> saying that {{the conditions of the}} prisoners were worse than those in their previous location. The Texas Board of Criminal Justice approved the relocation of the men's <b>death</b> <b>row</b> on Friday May 21, 1999.|$|R

Despite being classified platinum by the RIAA, the album was not very popular among music fans. In October 1996, Dre performed [...] "Been There, Done That" [...] on Saturday Night Live. In 1997, Dr. Dre produced several tracks on The Firm's The Album; it was met with largely negative reviews from critics. Rumors began to abound that Aftermath was facing financial difficulties. Aftermath Entertainment also faced a trademark infringement lawsuit by the underground thrash metal band Aftermath. First Round Knock Out, a compilation of various tracks produced and performed by Dr. Dre was also released in 1996, with material ranging from World Class Wreckin' Cru to N.W.A <b>to</b> <b>Death</b> <b>Row</b> recordings. Dr. Dre chose to take no part in the ongoing East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry of the time, instead producing for, and appearing on, several New York artists' releases, such as Nas' [...] "Nas Is Coming", LL Cool J's [...] "Zoom" [...] and Jay-Z's [...] "Watch Me".|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Supreme Court has {{declared}} it unconstitutional <b>to</b> execute <b>death</b> <b>row</b> inmates {{who are too}} insane to understand the fact of their pending execution and the reasons behind it. The Court has not specified, however, what mechanisms a state may constitutionally employ to render such an inmate sane enough to execute. This Note addresses whether states may forcibly administer antipsychotic drugs <b>to</b> insane <b>death</b> <b>row</b> inmates in order to restore their competence for execution. It concludes that states violate both the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments when execution is preceded by forcible medication with antipsychotic drugs. First, as soon as an execution date is set, a forcible medication program ceases to meet the constitutional requirement that it be “medically appropriate” because it no longer comports with the ethical standards of the medical profession, and it subverts treatment into a degrading punishment unique <b>to</b> incompetent <b>death</b> <b>row</b> inmates. Second, this scheme violates inmates’ rights to due process because the state’s interest in execution does not outweigh both an inmate’s privacy interest and the state’s own interest in preserving {{the integrity of the}} medical community when execution will be replaced by a life sentence without the possibility of parole...|$|R

2500|$|When Shakur {{recorded}} [...] "Hit 'Em Up", a diss song toward Biggie, he recruited {{three members}} from the former group, Dramacydal, {{with whom he had}} worked previously and was eager to do so again. Shakur, with the three New Jersey rappers and other associates, formed the original lineup of the Outlawz. When 2Pac signed <b>to</b> <b>Death</b> <b>Row</b> after his release from prison, he recruited step brother Mopreme Shakur and Big Syke from Thug Life. Hussein Fatal, Napoleon, E.D.I. Mean, Kastro, Yaki Kadafi, and Storm (the only female Outlaw) were also added, and together they formed the original lineup of the Outlaw Immortalz that debuted on 2Pac's Multi-Platinum smash All Eyez on Me. They later dropped the Immortal part of their name after the untimely deaths of 2Pac and Yaki Kadafi and moved on as Outlawz without the members of Thug Life.

2500|$|These {{were four}} of ten {{death row inmates}} known as the [...] "Death Row 10," [...] due to widely {{reported}} claims that the confessions that they had given in their respective cases had been coerced through police torture. Ryan {{is not the first}} state governor to have granted blanket commutations <b>to</b> <b>death</b> <b>row</b> inmates during his final days in office. Arkansas Governor Winthrop Rockefeller also commuted the sentence of every death row inmate in that state as he left office after losing his 1970 bid for a third two-year term, as did New Mexico Governor Toney Anaya before he left office in 1986 and Ohio Governor Dick Celeste before he left office in 1990. Ryan won praise from death penalty opponents: as early as 2001 he received the Mario Cuomo Act of Courage Award from Death Penalty Focus, in 2003 the Rose Elizabeth Bird Commitment to Justice Award from the same organization, and in 2005 he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. On {{the other side of the}} Atlantic, Robert Badinter, who had successfully introduced the bill abolishing the death penalty in France in 1981 praised the decision of George Ryan. Many conservatives, though, were opposed to the commutations, some questioning his motives, which came as a federal corruption investigation closed in on the governor and his closest political allies (see below). Conservative columnist Pat Buchanan called Ryan [...] "pathetic", and suggested the governor was attempting to save his public image in hopes of avoiding prison himself. Buchanan noted [...] "Ryan announced his decision to a wildly cheering crowd at the Northwestern University Law School. Families of the victims of the soon-to-be-reprieved killers were not invited." ...|$|E
