5|$|Some of the {{foundations}} {{are located in}} confined spots adjacent to I-66 and the electrified third rail of the Orange Line, making access difficult. Dulles Transit Partners offered to inspect seven foundations that were easily accessible, but the FTA insisted that all foundations be tested. Dulles Transit Partners and MWAA agreed to test all foundations before the bridge piers were built upon them. This required {{the portion of the}} Orange Line between the West Falls Church and East Falls Church Metro stations <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of service on weekends while the tests were conducted. The foundations were acceptable and the bridge construction proceeded using the existing foundations.|$|E
5|$|The film is an {{adaptation}} of The Winter's Tale by William Shakespeare, the shortened single reel adaption of the play. The film opens with {{the meeting of the}} kings of Bohemia and Sicilia. Hermione, the queen of Sicilia, entertains Polixenes, king of Bohemia. This arouses jealousy in Leontes, the king of Sicilia. Leontes decides to poison Polixenes and orders a courtier to carry out the task. The courtier slips the poison into the cup, but he changes his mind and confesses to the murderous plot. Polixenes and the courtier depart safely, but this enrages the Leontes, who has his wife imprisoned. In prison, Hermoine gives birth to a daughter and sends it to her husband, Hoping to quell his anger. This further upsets Leontes and he orders the child <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> to the wilderness to die. Hermione is then brought before a tribunal, swoons, and is pronounced dead by Paulina.|$|E
5|$|The sister {{trains in}} service with NSB were prone to {{technical}} failures, {{since they have}} to operate on hundred-year-old infrastructure on cross-mountain services. The Class 71 has more lenient operating conditions thanks to better infrastructure, and therefore has not been prone to as much malfunction. The only incident to ground all the Class 71 trains occurred on 17 June 2000, after a Class 73-train operated by NSB derailed at Nelaug Station owing to stress on the axles. The Oslo Airport Express Trains were back in service the next day, while the 73-series had to wait another month before returning to service. On 24 January 2004, a Class 71 unit had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of service due to smoke from a stressed bearing, causing {{the replacement of the}} bearings on all units within days.|$|E
50|$|In February 2013 the TGV Lyria sets (110 to 118) {{designed}} for services <b>to</b> Switzerland, <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of service. These {{were replaced by}} TGV POS sets.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to the two aforementioned incidents, in 1979, BIA's maintenance engineers had discovered fatigue cracks in the fuselages {{of some of the}} firm's Heralds during routine inspections of the aircraft.

25|$|Ventures {{into the}} genre by writers {{who were not}} devoted {{exclusively}} to science fiction also added respectability. Magazine covers of bug-eyed monsters and scantily clad women, however, preserved {{the image of a}} sensational genre appealing only to adolescents.

25|$|For safety {{reasons the}} railcars {{could not be}} run as single {{vehicles}} since they each had only one set of pinions. No.21 had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of service by 2001 owing to problems with the speed control mechanism, and Nos.22 and 23 were taken out of service in 2003 for the same reason.

25|$|A {{group of}} {{children}} placed large amounts of leaves into the track on 20 October 1955 a. Tram no. 24 up Eidsvolls gate could not handle the leaves, and started sliding backwards without breaking power. The conductor tried to spread sand on the tracks, {{but that did not}} help either. The tram behind, no. 19, noticed this just after leaving Vollabakken, but dared not back up due to the traffic. There were large material damages from the impact, but no-one was seriously injured. Since the two trams were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of traffic soon, both were withdrawn.|$|E
25|$|Foreign Service Officer Douglas Pike {{wrote that}} {{according}} to Viet Cong documents captured {{during and after the}} siege, members of the provincial administration were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of the city, held and punished for their “crimes against the Vietnamese people”. The disposition of those who were previously in control of the city was carefully laid out, and the lists were detailed and extensive. Those in the Saigon-based-state police apparatus at all levels were to be rounded up and held outside the city. High civilian and military officials were also removed from the city, both to await study of their individual cases.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, {{as a result of}} unusually high summertime temperatures, many MARTA rail cars became overheated, {{damaging}} on-board propulsion equipment. As a result, many trains broke down and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of service for repair. This was further {{compounded by the fact that}} at any given time up to 50 older rail cars were out of service as part of MARTA's rail car rehabilitation project. To compensate for the reduced number of operating rail cars, MARTA shortened trains from six to four cars in length. This sometimes resulted in almost half of the trains being shortened, creating crowded conditions for passengers.|$|E
50|$|The optimal game {{approach}} seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Egypt <b>out</b> {{immediately with}} a perfect surprise attack using a single brigade to push the war right to the Egyptian side, followed by invading Lebanon before it collapses and Jordan before anyone else invades it, while attempting to topple Iran by espionage (to prevent nuclear war with Iraq) and then, finally, invading and defeating Syria.|$|R
50|$|The Rahway Valley Railroad {{passed through}} the community, and during the early 20th century offered both freight and {{passenger}} service, but is currently out of service. The section of the railway that extended from Springfield <b>to</b> Summit <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of service in 1976, though special trains <b>were</b> operated <b>to</b> provide service to Baltusrol during the 1980 U.S. Open.|$|R
50|$|On 28 December 1976, an Army Major told Díaz {{he would}} become a legal {{prisoner}} and <b>was</b> transferred <b>to</b> the Pozo de Quilmes, where he joined Moler, Calotti and Miranda.

25|$|In {{the field}} of {{biomedical}} research, notably in America, patents were taken out on particular genes, treatments and techniques. From 1991, the NIH permitted patents <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> on anonymous gene fragments. This created extra costs and impediments to creating new treatments and tests. Although in principle rights holders could come {{together to make a}} deal, cognitive biases exist in rights owners that can often prevent deals that would likely be beneficial from occurring. For example, tests for certain breast cancer mutations were unavailable since the rights holder for the BRCA human gene did not release them onto the market, which lead to false negative tests for cancer. In the end the courts held that human genes were not patentable.|$|E
25|$|On December 29, 2008, {{shortly after}} 7 PM, an {{electrical}} {{fire broke out}} near the Walnut Creek station. The fire apparently started after a train ripped off {{a portion of the}} electric third rail, dragging it under the train and sparking a fire along the rail. The fire caused major delays of 2–3 hours, as Pittsburg/Bay Point bound trains could travel no further than Lafayette station, and San Francisco Airport bound trains were held at Concord station, having <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of service as the delays continued. A bus shuttle system was set up to take passengers along the Concord, Pleasant Hill, Walnut Creek, and Lafayette BART stations. Trains were eventually allowed through the station in both directions, sharing one track until the rail was repaired.|$|E
25|$|On March 6, 1930, Minor {{was part}} of a great series of demonstrations of the {{unemployed}} conducted around the United States under the guidance of the Communist Party. Minor was arrested at the demonstration held in Union Square in New York City, a rally which ended in a riot pitting marchers and police. Minor was arrested in conjunction with these events, together with his Communist Party comrades William Z. Foster, Israel Amter, and Harry Felton. The four were sentenced to 3 year terms in the New York state penitentiary. After serving 6 months in jail, Minor fell ill with appendicitis, which caused him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> in an ambulance to a private hospital for surgery. Minor {{spent the better part of}} the next two years attempting to recover his health.|$|E

25|$|The Irish {{began their}} season ranked 19th and facing the hardest {{schedule}} in the nation. They opened against the Washington State Cougars, playing {{the team for}} the first time in the history of the program. The Irish came back from being down by 19points to win in overtime, but Carlyle Holiday struggled as quarterback. In the next game against rival Michigan, the Wolverines avenged their 2002 loss by beating the Irish by a score of 38–0 in the first shutout in the series in 100years and the largest margin of victory ever between the two teams. After another loss to Michigan State, many Irish fans were calling for Holiday <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of the game in favor of freshman Brady Quinn, who saw his first collegiate action in the fourth quarter of the Michigan rout. Holiday was replaced as starter for the next game against Purdue.|$|E
25|$|On 5 January 2012 the Nambu (south) Clean Center, a waste {{incinerator}} in Kashiwa, Chiba, {{was taken out}} of production by the city council because the storage room was completely filled with 200 metric tons of radioactive ash that could not disposed of in landfills. Storage at the plant was full, with 1049 drums, and some 30 tons more were still <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of the incinerator. In September 2011, the factory was closed for two months for the same reason. The Center's special advanced procedures were able to minimize the volume of the ash, but radioactive cesium was concentrated to levels above the national limit of 8.000 becquerels per kilogram for waste disposal in landfills. It was not possible to secure new storage space for the radioactive ash. Radiation levels in Kashiwa were higher than in surrounding areas, and ashes containing up to 70,800 becquerels of radioactive cesium per kilogram – higher than the national limit – were detected in the city. Other cities around Kashiwa were facing the same problem: radioactive ash was piling up. Chiba prefecture asked Abiko and Inzai to accept temporary storage at the Teganuma waste-disposal facility located at their border. But this met strong opposition from their citizens.|$|E
25|$|On the IRT Pelham Line in 1980, a {{sharp rise in}} window-smashing on subway cars caused $2 {{million in}} damages; it spread to other lines {{during the course of}} the year. When the broken windows were {{discovered}} in trains that were still in service, they needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of service, causing additional delays; in August 1980 alone, 775 vandalism-related delays were reported. Vandalism of subway cars, including windows, continued through the mid-1980s; between January 27 and February 2, 1985, 1,129 pieces of glass were replaced on subway cars on the , , , , and K trains. Often, bus transfers, sold on the street for 50 cents, were also sold illegally, mainly at subway-to-bus transfer hubs. Mayor Koch even proposed to put a subway court in the Times Square subway station to speed up arraignments, as there were so many subway-related crimes by then. Meanwhile, high-ranking senior City Hall and transit officials considered raising the fare from 60 to 65 cents to fund additional transit police officers, who began to ride the subway during late nights (between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m.) owing to a sharp increase in crime in 1982. Operation High Visibility, commenced in June 1985, had this program extended to 6 a.m., and a police officer was to be present on every train in the system during that time.|$|E
