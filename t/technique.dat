5|$|Fukuda's {{training}} method consisted mostly {{of the student}} taking fall after fall for the teacher or senior student until he began to understand {{the mechanics of the}} <b>technique.</b> Fukuda stressed applied <b>technique</b> over ritual form. He gave beginners a short description of the <b>technique</b> and had them engage in free practice (randori) in order to teach through experience. It was only after the student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms (kata). This method was difficult, as there were no special mats for falling, only the standard straw mats (tatami) laid over wooden floors.|$|E
5|$|Jumping <b>technique</b> {{has played}} a {{significant}} part {{in the history of}} the event. High jumpers typically cleared the bar feet first in the late 19th century, using either the Scissors, Eastern cut-off or Western roll <b>technique.</b> The straddle <b>technique</b> became prominent in the mid-20th century, but Dick Fosbury overturned tradition by pioneering a backwards and head-first <b>technique</b> in the late 1960s – the Fosbury Flop – which won him the gold at the 1968 Olympics. This <b>technique</b> has become the overwhelming standard for the sport from the 1980s onwards. The standing high jump was contested at the Olympics from 1900 to 1912, but is now relatively uncommon outside of its use as an exercise drill.|$|E
5|$|Literary scholar M. Keith Booker {{argues that}} Vargas Llosa perfects the <b>technique</b> of {{interlacing}} dialogues {{in his novel}} The Green House. By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates {{the illusion of a}} flashback. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this <b>technique</b> as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places. This <b>technique</b> is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using {{near the end of his}} first novel, The Time of the Hero. However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in The Green House the <b>technique</b> is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space. In contrast, Captain Pantoja and the Special Service employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts. This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf's mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's counterpoint <b>technique</b> in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.|$|E
