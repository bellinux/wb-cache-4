40|$|Bacterial {{adhesion}} <b>to</b> <b>surfaces</b> occurs ubiquitously and {{is initially}} reversible, though becoming more irreversible within minutes after first {{contact with a}} surface. We here demonstrate for eight bacterial strains comprising four species, that bacteria adhere irreversibly <b>to</b> <b>surfaces</b> through multiple, reversibly-binding tethers that detach and successively re-attach, but not collectively detach to cause detachment of an entire bacterium. Arguments build on combining analyses of confined Brownian-motion of bacteria adhering to glass and their AFM force-distance curves and include the following observations: (1) force-distance curves showed detachment events indicative of multiple binding tethers, (2) vibration amplitudes of adhering bacteria parallel <b>to</b> a <b>surface</b> decreased with increasing adhesion-forces acting perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>surface,</b> (3) nanoscopic displacements of bacteria with relatively long autocorrelation times up to several seconds, in absence of microscopic displacement, (4) increases in Mean-Squared-Displacement over prolonged time periods according to tα with 0 <α≪ 1, indicative of confined displacement. Analysis of simulated position-maps of adhering particles using a new, in silico model confirmed that adhesion <b>to</b> <b>surfaces</b> is irreversible through detachment and successive re-attachment of reversibly-binding tethers. This makes bacterial adhesion mechanistically comparable with the irreversible adsorption of high-molecular-weight proteins <b>to</b> <b>surfaces,</b> mediated by multiple, reversibly-binding molecular segments...|$|R

5|$|A viral {{marketing}} campaign was employed for the film.

The rest of the campaign unrolled after WonderCon in April2010, where Warner gave away promotional T-shirts featuring the PASIV briefcase used to create the dream space, and had a QR code linking to an online manual of the device. Mind Crime also received a stage2 with more resources, including a hidden trailer for the movie. More pieces of {{viral marketing}} began <b>to</b> <b>surface</b> before Inceptions release, such as a manual filled with bizarre images and text sent to Wired magazine, and the online publication of posters, ads, phone applications, and strange websites all related to the film.

5|$|Also {{announced}} in November 1896 was {{a bill to}} be presented by the District Railway (DR) for a tube railway to be constructed beneath its existing sub-surface line between Gloucester Road and Mansion House stations. The DR operated a steam railway, running in cut and cover tunnels, and planned to ease congestion along its heavily used route by constructing an express line with just a single intermediate station at Charing Cross (now Embankment). The express line was <b>to</b> <b>surface</b> west of Gloucester Road and connect to the DR's existing line at Earl's Court. Since, like the B, the DR's deep tube line would be operated with electric trains, the DR planned to build a generating station adjacent to its Walham Green station (now Fulham Broadway). The bill received assent on 6 August 1897 as the Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1897.|$|E

These viruses infect specific bacteria by binding <b>to</b> <b>surface</b> receptor molecules and then entering the cell.

5|$|By August18, the NHC {{noted that}} the {{hurricane}} was asymmetrical, having uneven distribution of the wind radii.

By 0600UTC, Hurricane Hunters recorded flight level winds of 140mph (225km/h), corresponding <b>to</b> <b>surface</b> winds of 115mph (185km/h). At this time, the barometric pressure of the storm also decreased to 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg), the lowest pressure recorded during the storm.

5|$|Early on September1, Hurricane Luis {{strengthened}} into a Category3 hurricane with {{winds of}} 115mph (185km/h); upper-level outflow continued to improve throughout the day, allowing further intensification. Maintaining its structure, Luis further intensified to a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 135mph (215km/h). Subsequent to doing so, its intensity remained steady for 42hours while it tracked nearly due west. Early on September3, satellite intensity estimates {{indicated that the}} storm strengthened slightly, attaining its peak winds of 140mph (220km/h) at around 0600UTC. Continuing on a westward track, the forward motion of the hurricane decreased to 13mph (20km/h) later on September3. When Luis was about 690mi (1,110km) east of the Lesser Antilles, a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance flight into the storm confirmed satellite intensity estimates.
