5|$|Archaea {{are genetically}} {{distinct}} from bacteria and eukaryotes, {{with up to}} 15% of the proteins encoded by any one archaeal genome being unique to the domain, although most of these unique genes have no known function. Of {{the remainder of the}} unique proteins <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> identified function, most belong to the Euryarchaea and are involved in methanogenesis. The proteins that archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes share form a common core of cell function, relating mostly to transcription, translation, and nucleotide metabolism. Other characteristic archaeal features are the organization of genes of related function—such as enzymes that catalyze steps in the same metabolic pathway into novel operons, and large differences in tRNA genes and their aminoacyl tRNA synthetases.|$|E
5|$|Fund {{accounting}} {{distinguishes between}} two primary classes of fund. Those funds <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> unrestricted use, {{that can be}} spent for any purposes by the organisation and those that have a restricted use. The reason for the restriction can be {{for a number of}} different reasons. Examples include legal requirements, where the moneys can only be lawfully used for a specific purpose, or a restriction imposed by the donor or provider. These donor/provider restrictions are usually communicated in writing and may be found in the terms of an agreement, government grant, will or gift.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{methods can}} be used to enclose an {{arbitrary}} simple polygon within a curve of constant width, whose width equals the diameter of the given polygon. The resulting shape consists of circular arcs (at most as many as sides of the polygon), can be constructed algorithmically in linear time, and can be drawn with compass and straightedge. Although the regular-polygon based Reuleaux polygons all have an odd number of circular-arc sides, it is possible to construct constant-width shapes based on irregular polygons <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> even number of sides.|$|E

5|$|The Mendip Hills Partnership, which {{performs}} {{an administrative}} role, includes the five local authorities {{that cover the}} AONB, statutory bodies such as the Countryside Agency and English Nature, together with parish councils and other organisations and groups <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> interest in the conservation and care of the area. The Mendip Hills AONB staff unit of the partnership is based at the Charterhouse Centre {{in the heart of}} the AONB. The AONB Unit consists of four staff: a manager, project officer, support officer and part-time planning officer. They are supported by 20 volunteer rangers. In 2005 a proposal was submitted to the Countryside Agency to extend the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty to Steep Holm and Brean Down in the west and towards Frome in the east.|$|E
5|$|The clumpy {{structure}} of the dust belt {{may be explained by}} gravitational perturbation from a planet, dubbed Epsilon Eridani b. The clumps in the dust occur at orbits <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> integer resonance with the orbit of the suspected planet. For example, the region of the disk that completes two orbits for every three orbits of a planet is in a 3:2 orbital resonance. In computer simulations the ring morphology can be reproduced by the capture of dust particles in 5:3 and 3:2 orbital resonances with a planet that has an orbital eccentricity of about 0.3. Alternatively, the clumpiness may have been caused by collisions between minor planets known as plutinos.|$|E
5|$|While many {{bacteria}} and mitochondria have polyadenylate polymerases, {{they also have}} another type of polyadenylation, performed by polynucleotide phosphorylase itself. This enzyme is found in bacteria, mitochondria, plastids and as a constituent of the archaeal exosome (in those archaea <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> exosome). It can synthesise a 3' extension where {{the vast majority of}} the bases are adenines. Like in bacteria, polyadenylation by polynucleotide phosphorylase promotes degradation of the RNA in plastids and likely also archaea.|$|E

5|$|Like all milk-caps (Lactarius and Lactifluus), L.deceptivus is mycorrhizal, {{meaning the}} fungus forms a mutualistic {{association}} with certain trees and shrubs. The subterranean mycelium of the fungus forms an intimate association with tree roots, enveloping {{them in a}} sheath of tissue that allows both organisms to exchange nutrients they would otherwise be unable to obtain. The fruit bodies of the fungus grow solitarily, scattered, or in groups {{on the ground in}} conifer or hardwood forests, often under oak (Quercus) or hemlock (Tsuga). Smith has noted a preference for bogs and the edges of woodland pools in hardwood forests, and in oak stands <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> understory of blueberry bushes (Vaccinium species). It is widely distributed in eastern North America, and has also been reported from southern and western Canada. It is a fairly common species, and fruits from June to October. The mushroom has also been reported from Mexico (in Puebla and in Veracruz) from oak and pine forests, at altitudes slightly over , and from Costa Rica, where it is abundant in oak forests.|$|E
5|$|Stars {{generate}} {{energy by}} the nuclear fusion of elements. Unlike the Sun, massive stars possess the mass needed to fuse elements <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> atomic mass greater than hydrogen and helium, albeit at increasingly higher temperatures and pressures, causing increasingly shorter stellar life spans. The degeneracy pressure of electrons {{and the energy}} generated by these fusion reactions are sufficient to counter {{the force of gravity}} and prevent the star from collapsing, maintaining stellar equilibrium. The star fuses increasingly higher mass elements, starting with hydrogen and then helium, progressing up through the periodic table until a core of iron and nickel is produced. Fusion of iron or nickel produces no net energy output, so no further fusion can take place, leaving the nickel-iron core inert. Due to the lack of energy output creating outward pressure, equilibrium is broken and the core is compressed by the overlying mass of the star.|$|E
5|$|The poxviruses are large, complex viruses <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> unusual morphology. The {{viral genome}} is {{associated}} with proteins within a central disc structure known as a nucleoid. The nucleoid {{is surrounded by a}} membrane and two lateral bodies of unknown function. The virus has an outer envelope with a thick layer of protein studded over its surface. The whole virion is slightly pleiomorphic, ranging from ovoid to brick shape. Mimivirus {{is one of the largest}} characterised viruses, with a capsid diameter of 400nm. Protein filaments measuring 100nm project from the surface. The capsid appears hexagonal under an electron microscope, therefore the capsid is probably icosahedral. In 2011, researchers discovered the largest then known virus in samples of water collected from the ocean floor off the coast of Las Cruces, Chile. Provisionally named Megavirus chilensis, it can be seen with a basic optical microscope. In 2013, the Pandoravirus genus was discovered in Chile and Australia, and has genomes about twice as large as Megavirus and Mimivirus.|$|E
