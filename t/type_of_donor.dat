40|$|Objective To analyse {{the risk}} factors of relapse before bone marrow {{transplantation}} (BMT) and to present the prognostic information as good as possible. Methods A total of 3142 patients, who underwent the allogeneic blood or bone marrow transplantation between 1989 and 1997 and were documented in the European Group for Blood and Marrow transplantation (EBMT), were included. Six possible risk factors including <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>donor,</b> stage of disease, age, gender, donor-recipient sex combination and the waiting time from diagnosis to transplation of relapse were considered. The time to relapse was analysed by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression with stratification on prognostic factors that did not satisfy the Proportional Hazard Assumption. Results An amount of 447 patients relapsed out of all 3142 patients. The relapse rate was 14. 2 %. <b>Type</b> <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> and stage of disease showed a clear prognostic effect, but failed the proportional hazard assumption.

RESULTS: We performed allogeneic HSCT for 42 children (26 males and 16 females) with AML in 1994 - 2012. The median age at HSCT was 9. 2 years (range, 0. 8 to 18. 5 years). Sixteen children were transplanted in first complete remission, 19 in second remission, 1 in third remission, and 6 with non-remission. Donors were matched sibling (MS) (n ? 17), 1 -antigen mismatched parent (MP) (n ? 2), matched unrelated donor (MUD) (n ? 11), or 4 - 6 / 6 HLA-matched unrelated cord blood (UCB) (n ? 12). Five-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were better in patients who received UCB compared to MS, MUD, or MP (OS: 76. 2 % vs. 32. 4 % vs. 18. 2 % vs. 0 %; RFS: 71. 4 % vs. 32. 7 % vs. 18. 2 % vs. 0 %).

From 2000 to 2009, 198 children receiving 217 allogeneic HSCT developed 134 severe infectious episodes (103  bacteremias and 31 IFD). The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> (AD versus MRD) {{was the most important}} risk factor for the severe infections (P =. 0052).

Finally, infectious episodes occurred late after HSCT, especially in presence of severe aGVHD, and bacteremias were 3 to 6 times more frequent than IFD.

40|$|To {{avoid the}} center effect and the {{possible}} hidden interactions of multicenter studies, {{the validity of the}} Cox Proportional Hazards Model for the analysis of a single-center kidney transplant program was tested, considering 287 renal transplants performed in a 10 -year period. The inclusion of <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> and main immunosuppressive drug as covariates in the model did not violate the proportionality assumption of the Cox model. According to this method, the following covariates were significant in predicting graft survival: cyclosporine, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>donor,</b> good human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -A and HLA-B match (DR data were not considered), highest percentage of reactive antibodies against panel cells, and nephroangiosclerosis as a primary renal disease.

Methods: Twenty-five Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to five groups of five animals each, in which three different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> injury (crush, ligation, and transection injury) distal to the coaptation site were executed (groups C, D, and E, respectively).

We hypothesized that this strategy may provide better posttransplant outcome. Between July 1993 and April 2002, 235 children received a primary LT from a LD (n = 100) or a deceased donor (DD) (n = 135). Demographic, surgical and immunological variables were compared, and respective impact on posttransplant complications was studied using a multivariate analysis. Five-year patient survival rates were 92 % and 85 % for groups LD and DD, respectively (p = 0. 181), the corresponding graft survival rates being 89 % and 77 % (p = 0. 033). At multivariate analysis: (1) <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> (DD) was correlated with higher rate of artery thrombosis (p < 0. 012); (2) biliary complication rate at 5 years was 29 % and 23 % for groups LD and DD, respectively (p = 0. 451); (3) lower acute rejection incidence could be correlated with <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> (DD) (p = 0. 001), and immunosuppressive therapy (tacrolimus) (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Although cloned embryos {{generated}} by somatic/embryonic stem cell nuclear transfer (SECNT) certainly {{give rise to}} viable individuals, they can often undergo embryonic arrest at any stage of embryogenesis, leading to diverse morphological abnormalities. In an effort to gain further insights into reprogramming and the properties of SECNT embryos, we performed a large-scale gene expression profiling of 87 single blastocysts using GeneChip microarrays. Sertoli cells, cumulus cells, and embryonic stem cells were used as donor cells. The gene expression profiles of 87 blastocysts were subjected to microarray analysis. Using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering, the gene expression profiles were clearly classified into 3 clusters corresponding to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> cell.

This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to compare {{and evaluate the}} heath-related quality of life (HRQOL) in Greek adult transplant recipients before and 2 years after successful renal transplantation (RT). The SF- 36 survey score was used. Methods. Eighty-five Greek hemodialysis patients underwent RT at the Transplant Unit of Evangelismos General Hospital of Athens, including 44 men and 41 women (mean age 43. 8 years; range 21 - 59 years). The scale scores of a Greek version of the SF- 36 survey were compared between the transplant and the hemodialysis patients. We also examined the relationships of the scale scores with the patients′ age and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>donor.</b> Results. According to the SF- 36 health survey, transplant recipients had better results for general health perception (p≤ 0. 001), role-physical functioning (p≤ 0. 01), role-emotional functioning (p≤ 0. 01), and vitality (p≤ 0. 01). In addition, the scale score of physical functioning, general health and vitality of the patients who were younger than 30 years {{at the time of}} transplantation were significantly higher than those of the patients who were older than 30 years, while the scores of bodily pain, general health, and physical functioning were significantly lower in cadaveric graft recipients compared with living-related recipients. Conclusions. The SF- 36 health survey is a validated and comprehensive instrument for evaluating renal transplant patients′ HRQOL. Our data demonstrated an improvement in HRQOL in renal transplant patients 2 years after successful renal transplantation. The data also confirmed that the recipients′ age at transplantation and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> were important factors affecting the HRQOL...|$|E

40|$|Native Xenopus oocytes express two isoforms of muscarinic receptors that mediate qualitatively {{different}} physiological responses. Oocytes {{of the majority}} <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> (common) express M 3 -like receptors (M 3 Rs) at comparable densities at both the animal and vegetal hemispheres of the cell. Rare (variant) donors possess oocytes that express mainly M 1 -like receptors (M 1 Rs), localized predominantly at the animal hemisphere. We have investigated the apparent degradation of these two isoforms {{and its relationship to}} their hemispheric distribution. Cycloheximide (CHX) caused a time-dependent decrease in receptor-mediated responses and [3 H]quinuclidinyl benzylate (QNB) binding in oocytes from both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>donors.</b> The t 1 / 2 values ranged between 3 and 7 h. Removal of CHX resulted in rapid recovery of the response. This implied rapid degradation and turnover <b>of</b> both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> receptors. The loss of M 1 Rs was more than that of M 3 Rs. Moreover, the decrease was more rapid and more extensive on the animal hemisphere in both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>donors.</b> Injection <b>of</b> oocytes expressing either receptor isoform with specific antisense oligonucleotides complementary to either m 1 or m 3 muscarinic receptors (from mouse) showed receptor loss at approximately the same rate as that calculated from experiments with CHX. Furthermore, oocytes <b>of</b> variant <b>donors</b> express M 1 Rs exclusively on the animal hemisphere, while the residual activity found on the vegetal hemisphere of the cell was mediated by M 3 Rs. Inhibition of putative receptor glycosylation with tunicamycin caused a rapid decrease in receptor-mediated responses and radioligand binding on M 1 Rs, but had virtually no effect on M 3 Rs. The expression of cloned m 1 muscarinic receptors, however, was not affected by tunicamycin, suggesting that glycosylation is not a general prerequisite for the functional expression of muscarinic receptors...|$|R
