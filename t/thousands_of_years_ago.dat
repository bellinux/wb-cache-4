5|$|Plant ecology is {{the science}} of the {{functional}} relationships between plants and their habitats—the environments where they complete their life cycles. Plant ecologists study the composition of local and regional floras, their biodiversity, genetic diversity and fitness, the adaptation of plants to their environment, and their competitive or mutualistic interactions with other species. Some ecologists even rely on empirical data from indigenous people that is gathered by ethnobotanists. This information can relay {{a great deal of}} information on how the land once was <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> and how it has changed over that time. The goals of plant ecology are to understand the causes of their distribution patterns, productivity, environmental impact, evolution, and responses to environmental change.|$|E

40|$|Aksaray, {{which is}} in the middle of Anatolia and is located where the paths intersect, has been an {{important}} settlement of people throughout the history. The financial activities are still continuing in this region. It attracts the interests of civilizations in terms of financial situation as well thanks to its location. Trade in Aşıklı Höyük about ten <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> Güvercinkayası (the first castle of Anatolia), and the evidence found in Acemhöyük, which is the earliest trade centre of Aksaray, reveal that the financial history of the city dates back to ancient times. The financial developments of Aksaray in the first <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the Republic are fairly frequent and rapid in comparison to other cities. This study which focuses on the answers of such questions as ‘’who conducted business in Aksaray and where?’’, “What kind of contributes was made to city by means of these financial activities?’’ aims to inspire those who want to carry out research on the financial history of Aksaray...|$|R

5|$|There are few native natural predators of emus still alive. Early in its species history it {{may have}} faced {{numerous}} terrestrial predators now extinct, including the giant lizard Megalania, the thylacine, and possibly other carnivorous marsupials, which may explain their seemingly well-developed ability to defend themselves from terrestrial predators. The main predator of emus today is the dingo, which was originally introduced by Aboriginals <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> from a stock of semi-domesticated wolves. Dingoes try to kill the emu by attacking the head. The emu typically tries to repel the dingo by jumping {{into the air and}} kicking or stamping the dingo on its way down. The emu jumps as the dingo barely has the capacity to jump high enough to threaten its neck, so a correctly timed leap to coincide with the dingo's lunge can keep its head and neck out of danger.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic eruptions eject {{large amounts}} of carbon into the air. The carbon is of {{geological}} origin and has no detectable , so the / ratio {{in the vicinity of}} the volcano is depressed relative to surrounding areas. Dormant volcanoes can also emit aged carbon. Plants that photosynthesize this carbon also have lower / ratios: for example, plants on the Greek island of Santorini, near the volcano, have apparent ages of up to a thousand years. These effects are hard to predict– the town of Akrotiri, on Santorini, was destroyed in a volcanic eruption <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> but radiocarbon dates for objects recovered from the ruins of the town show surprisingly close agreement with dates derived from other means. If the dates for Akrotiri are confirmed, it would indicate that the volcanic effect in this case was minimal.|$|E
5|$|A {{corporation}} called RX Tech excavates {{the crash}} site of a meteorite that impacted on Antarctica {{millions of years ago}} and finds strange Rapa Nui-like statues alongside the grave of one of HMS Beagle's sailors. Meanwhile, archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft is searching for an artefact known as the Infada Stone in the ruins of an ancient Indian Hindu temple once inhabited by the Infada tribe. After taking the artefact from a researcher working for RX Tech, Lara is approached by RX Tech scientist Dr. Willard, who explains that polynesians came across a meteorite crater in Antarctica <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> and found that it held incredible power. Using rock from the meteorite, they crafted four crystalline artefacts, one of which is the Infada Stone. They then fled Antarctica for unknown reasons, but in the 19th century a group of sailors travelling with Charles Darwin came to Antarctica and rediscovered the artefacts. The four artefacts were then distributed across the globe. Dr. Willard has been able to track the artefacts by using the diary of one of the sailors. Lara agrees to help him find the other three.|$|E

40|$|The {{palm tree}} family (Arecaceae) is {{constituted}} by approximately 3000 species mainly {{distributed in the}} tropics and subtropics. As a source {{of a variety of}} products they contribute to the world and local economies, and also to peoples lifestyles. Historically their use has been based on wild populations, but also on local domestication. Very few species are subject of plant breeding programs and are cultivated in the world. This is the case of the African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), in which investment and development consortiums invest high sums. Another kind of crop is the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), which was domesticated <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> and whose success is based in the export of a fine product with worldwide recognition. In this case the production is based on traditional varieties and has very incipient breeding programs. A third group of palms includes those species from which products are obtained and manufactured for local development. The objective of this literature review is to contribute in the analysis of opportunities and weaknesses to investing in domestication and plant breeding programs in those palm trees with a recognized productive value...|$|R

5|$|Alcohol has a {{long history}} of use and misuse {{throughout}} recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed prohibition of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 alcohol dependence and abuse was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more than cancer and obesity.|$|E
5|$|With {{material}} from previous articles, Weisman uses {{the fate of}} the Mayan civilization to illustrate the possibility of an entrenched society vanishing and how the natural environment quickly conceals evidence. To demonstrate how vegetation could compromise human built infrastructure, Weisman interviewed hydrologists and employees at the Panama Canal, where constant maintenance is required to keep the jungle vegetation and silt away from the dams. To illustrate abandoned cities succumbing to nature, Weisman reports from Chernobyl, Ukraine (abandoned in 1986) and Varosha, Cyprus (abandoned in 1974). Weisman finds that their structures crumble as weather does unrepaired damage and other life forms create new habitats. In Turkey, Weisman contrasts the construction practices of the rapidly growing Istanbul, as typical for large cities in less developed countries, with the underground cities in Cappadocia. Due to a large demand for housing in Istanbul much of it was developed quickly with whatever material was available and could collapse in a major earthquake or other natural disaster. Cappadocian underground cities were built <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> out of volcanic tuff, and are likely to survive for centuries to come.|$|E
5|$|Able {{to return}} to Another world, Serge allies with the Acacia Dragoons against Porre and locates that dimension's Dragon Tear, {{allowing}} him {{to return to}} his human form. He then enters the Sea of Eden, Another world's physical equivalent of the Dead Sea, finding a temporal research facility from the distant future called Chronopolis. Lynx and Kid are inside; Serge defeats Lynx and the supercomputer FATE, allowing the six Dragons of El Nido to steal the Frozen Flame and retire to Terra Tower, a massive structure raised from the sea floor. Kid falls into a coma, and Harle bids the party goodbye to fly with the Dragons. Serge regroups his party and tends to Kid, who remains comatose. Continuing his adventure, he obtains and cleanses the corrupted Masamune sword from Chrono Trigger. He then uses the Dragon relics and shards of the Dragon Tears to create the mythic Element Chrono Cross. The spiritual power of the Masamune later allows him to lift Kid from her coma. At Terra Tower, the prophet of time, revealed to be Belthasar from Chrono Trigger, visits him with visions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca. Serge learns that the time research facility Chronopolis created El Nido <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> after a catastrophic experimental failure drew it to the past. The introduction of a temporally foreign object in history caused the planet to pull in a counterbalance from a different dimension. This was Dinopolis, a city of Dragonians—parallel universe descendants of Chrono Triggers Reptites. The institutions warred and Chronopolis subjugated the Dragonians. Humans captured their chief creation—the Dragon God, an entity capable of controlling nature.|$|E

40|$|Mars {{is a small}} {{planet with}} a thin {{atmosphere}} of almost pure carbon dioxide. To first order, the Martian meteorology can be compared with what one would expect on a cold, dry desert-like Earth. However, several phenomena make the Martian climate system more complex than it appears. First, as much as 30 % of the carbon dioxide atmosphere condenses every winter at high latitude to form CO 2 ice polar caps, inducing large surface pressure variations all over the planet and an atmospheric circulation without equivalent on Earth. Second, a highly variable amount of suspended dust lifted by the winds modifies the radiative properties of the atmosphere, with sometime global dust storms able to totally shroud the planet. Last, a peculiar water cycle occurs on Mars, with water vapor transported by the atmosphere between the polar caps and possibly subsurface reservoirs, allowing the formation of clouds, hazes and frost. Telescopic and spacecraft observations have shown us that this complex climate system is highly variable, seasonally and from year to year, but these variations remain poorly understood. In fact, the Martian climate system has probably experienced large variations related to the oscillations in {{the parameters of the}} orbit and rotation of Mars (obliquity) a few millions or even <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> These oscillations affected surface temperatures and the water cycle, inducing the mobilization and accumulation of large ice deposits in various locations on the planets. In a much distant past, it is also likely that Mars may have been a completely different planet. The observations of the geology (dry riverbeds and deltas, lacustrine sediments) and mineralogy (clay, sulfate) of the oldest surface on Mars dating back to more than 3 billions <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> provide evidence that liquid water was then abundant on the surface, at least episodically. Mars may have been warmed by a thicker atmosphere containing greenhouse gas and clouds, high geothermal fluxes, or episodically by large asteroid impacts...|$|R

Bibliography pointing towards useful sources of general and specialist information on the history, dialectology, and structure of Greek is offered as well. GENERAL OVERVIEW Although very much a living and vibrant language today with speakers numbering in the millions around the world, the history and development of Modern Greek actually begin <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> when speakers <b>of</b> a very ancient form of the language entered the Balkan peninsula some time in the early part of the second millennium BC. TheseElsevier Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics (2 nd Edition – ELL 2) speakers moved quickly, according to most current accounts, into the southern part of the region [...] what is now northern and central Greece and the Peloponnesos [...] and into most of the neighboring islands of the Aegean Sea and beyond including Crete as the most southerly point and Cyprus to the east. This settlement area essentially defines the space where to this day the Greek language remains an enduring presence, though there has been spread into other areas, in some cases dating from ancient times. Modern Greek is the official language of the Hellenic Republic (i. e., the Republic of Greece) where there are some 11, 000, 000 speakers, and also of the Republic of Cyprus, with some 600, 000 speakers. In large part the result of ancient colonization, Greek is found today in numerous communities and enclaves around the Mediterranean and Black Sea area, including Southern Italy, Alexandria (Egypt), and the region around the Crimean peninsula. Moreover, Greeks in modern times have migrated to many locations throughout Europe (but especially England), Australia (with a large concentration aroun...|$|R
