5|$|Some {{palladium}} is emitted {{with the}} exhaust gases of cars with catalytic converters. Between 4 and 108ng/km of palladium particulate is released by such cars, while the total uptake from food is estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 2µg per person a day. The second possible source of palladium is dental restoration, {{from which the}} uptake of palladium is estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 15µg per person per day. People working with palladium or its compounds might have a considerably greater uptake. For soluble compounds such as palladium chloride, 99% is eliminated from the body within 3 days.|$|E

Even for longer duration or more invasive procedures, a general anesthetic may be administered without intubating the trachea, provided that patients are carefully selected, and the risk-benefit ratio is favorable (i.e., the risks associated with an unprotected airway are believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> the risks of intubating the trachea).|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1851, a French {{cargo ship}} {{carrying}} 98 tons of goods from Gibraltar to Rabat capsized near {{the coast of}} Salé. A few tons of goods were rescued, and were stored {{in the city for}} safekeeping. Salé turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> safe, however; by the next day, hundreds of townspeople were scavenging and stealing the goods. The thieves were thwarted by , but only temporarily. By the end of the raids, the French had lost 11,391 franc germinals worth of goods.|$|E
5|$|Some {{approaches}} explicitly define real {{numbers to}} be certain structures built upon the rational numbers, using axiomatic set theory. The natural numbers – 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on – begin with 0 and continue upwards, so that every number has a successor. One can extend the natural numbers with their negatives to give all the integers, and to further extend to ratios, giving the rational numbers. These number systems are accompanied by the arithmetic of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More subtly, they include ordering, so that one number {{can be compared to}} another and found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>than,</b> greater than, or equal to another number.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} {{lists the}} number one best-selling singles in Canada in 2007 published in Billboard magazine under the Hits of the World section. Only songs released as physical singles qualified for this chart during this time. During this period, the singles market in Canada was very limited in both scope and availability, and in many cases, these songs received little or no radio support. For tracks other than those by American Idol or Canadian Idol winners, sales were likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 1,000 per week. Nevertheless, {{this was the only}} singles chart Canadians had until June 2007, when the Canadian Hot 100 was released to the public.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening in}} 1885 of the Saint-Louis–Dakar railway {{increased}} the traffic over the bridge.

To prevent the breakdown of the bridge a special decree was given so that the maximum weight for a vehicle that crosses the bridge <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> one and a half tonnes. With all its difficulties the bridge remained in service 32 years, until 1897 when it was dismantled.|$|E

5|$|The star is {{estimated}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> {{a billion years}} old. Because of its relative youth, Epsilon Eridani has {{a higher level of}} magnetic activity than the present-day Sun, with a stellar wind 30 times as strong. Its rotation period is 11.2days at the equator. Epsilon Eridani is smaller and less massive than the Sun, and has a comparatively lower level of elements heavier than helium. It is a main-sequence star of spectral class K2, which means that energy generated at the core through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is emitted from the surface at a temperature of about , giving it an orange hue.|$|E
5|$|In 1999 the {{population}} {{was estimated to be}} at less than 84, with 74 ewes. In 2002, there were between 92 and 100 animals, with 92 ewes and the male population estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 7. In 2012, 204 ewes were registered in herdbooks. Since 2012, sheep numbers have been increasing year on year; and in 2017 the Rare Breeds Survival Trust (RBST) moved the classification of the sheep from 'Category 2: Critical' to 'Category 3: Vulnerable' as the number of breeding ewes was estimated to exceed 500. This data was collected from the herdbooks produced by breed societies, listing all registered sheep, and multiplying the number of registered sheep to account for non-registered sheep.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} speculated that the 7s {{electrons}} are relativistically stabilized, so that in reducing conditions, only the 7p1/2 or 6d electron would be ionized, leading to the monovalent Lr+ ion. However, all experiments to reduce Lr3+ to Lr2+ or Lr+ in aqueous solution were unsuccessful, similarly to lutetium. On the basis of this, the standard electrode potential of the E°(Lr3+→Lr+) couple was calculated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> −1.56V, indicating {{that the existence of}} Lr+ ions in aqueous solution was unlikely. The upper limit for the E°(Lr3+→Lr2+) couple was predicted to be −0.44V: the values for E°(Lr3+→Lr) and E°(Lr4+→Lr3+) are predicted to be −2.06V and +7.9V. The stability of the group oxidation state in the 6d transition series decreases as RfIV > DbV > SgVI, and lawrencium continues the trend with LrIII being more stable than RfIV.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{requirements}} of the Foundling Hospital was that babies were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> six months old at the time of admittance, but the hospital did not keep more accurate records of age. Another requirement was that foundlings were given a new name and a reference number, so Sabrina became Girl Ann Kingston no. 4759. She was taken in by a wet nurse, Mary Penfold, who brought her to Wotton, Surrey, where she remained until 1759, when she was two years old. Although it was usual for foundlings to remain with their wet nurse until the age of five or six, the Foundling Hospital had received an influx of new babies and moved many children who no longer required nursing, including Sabrina, to the Shrewsbury branch of the Foundling Hospital. The Shrewsbury building was not completed until 1765, so in the meantime Sabrina and another foundling were cared for by a nurse, Ann Casewell, at her home.|$|E
5|$|The Football Association chose St Andrew's to {{host the}} 1907 FA Cup {{semifinal}} between The Wednesday and Woolwich Arsenal; Wednesday won 3–1, {{and went on to}} win the tournament. This was the first FA Cup tie to be played at the ground, as Birmingham had lost their opening match away from home. Three more semifinals took place at St Andrew's before the Second World War, in 1911, 1924 and 1934. The club bought the freehold of the ground in 1921 for a price believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> £7,000 (£ today). In the 1930s, roofs were erected over the Kop and Railway End terraces, and in February 1939, the ground attendance record, variously recorded as 66,844 or 67,341, was set at the fifth-round FA Cup tie against Everton.|$|E
5|$|The Weather Bureau {{predicted}} Flora {{to turn to}} {{the northwest}} after entering the Windward Passage and affect the Bahamas. Forecasters advised those in The Bahamas to quickly complete preparations, though the eye of the hurricane did not pass over the archipelago until four days later. When Flora turned to the northeast out to sea, forecasters again advised Bahamian citizens to prepare for the hurricane, and on October 9, weather advisories advised the southeastern Bahamas to prepare for gale-force winds and strong tides. One advisory considered there <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> a 50% chance of the hurricane reaching southeastern Florida, though weather bulletins advised Florida citizens to monitor the hurricane. At its closest approach to Florida, the hurricane remained 330miles (530km) away, though gale warnings were issued from Stuart to Key West due to the hurricane's large size.|$|E
