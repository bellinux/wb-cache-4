5|$|Aigusta {{was baptized}} as Anastasia {{in order to}} marry Simeon of Russia in 1333; he became Grand Prince of Moscow in 1341. There is no direct {{evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> daughter of Gediminas, but because the marriage was high-profile, most historians have concluded <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> member of Gediminas' family. The marriage had great potential because Lithuania and Moscow were fierce rivals for supremacy in Ruthenia, but conflicts broke out again in 1335, just {{two years after the}} marriage. Her two sons Vasilei and Konstantin did not survive infancy; her daughter Vasilisa married Mikhail Vasilevich of Kashin, a Tverite prince opposing Lithuania. Her brother Jaunutis sought her help when he was deposed by Algirdas in 1345. Immediately before her death on 11 March 1345 Aigusta became a nun. She was buried within the Moscow Kremlin at a monastic church whose construction she had sponsored.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{this series}} of events is {{extremely}} improbable. Constantius had already left Helena {{by the time he}} left for Britain. Additionally, no earlier source mentions that Helena was born in Britain, let alone <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> princess. Henry's source for the story is unknown, though {{it may have been a}} lost hagiography of Helena.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Sargent married Eileen Laura Harding Horne (1898–1977), {{daughter}} of Frederick Horne of Drinkstone, Suffolk. Sargent's biographers differ on her background. Aldous states <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> maid in domestic service, whereas Reid notes <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> keen rider, with many friends in hunting circles, {{and that her}} uncle (who officiated at her wedding to Sargent) was rector of Drinkstone, Suffolk. According to Aldous, it was believed locally that Sargent had to marry Horne, having made her pregnant. By 1926, the couple had two children, a daughter Pamela who died of polio in 1944, and a son Peter. Sargent was much affected by his daughter's death, and his recording of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius in 1945 was an expression of his grief.|$|E

Nonetheless, as the evening wears on, neither do you doubt <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> middle-aged man. <b>She</b> looks the same, but <b>she</b> <b>is</b> different.' ...|$|R

5|$|Queen Christina of Sweden's {{tendency}} to dress {{as a man}} was well known during her time, and excused because of her noble birth. She was brought up as a male and there was speculation at the time <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> hermaphrodite. Even after Christina abdicated the throne in 1654 to avoid marriage, she was known to pursue romantic relationships with women.|$|E
5|$|Queen Meresankh IV {{has also}} been {{suggested}} as a consort for Menkauhor based on the dating and location of her tomb in Saqqara. It is possible however <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> wife of Djedkare Isesi.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptologist Wilfried Seipel has {{proposed}} that this pyramid was initially intended for queen Meresankh IV, whom he and Verner {{see as a}} wife of Djedkare. Seipel contends that Meresankh was finally buried in a smaller mastaba in Saqqara North after she fell into disgrace. Alternatively, Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton have proposed <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> wife of the preceding king, Menkauhor Kaiu.|$|E

5|$|According to The Intellectual in Twentieth-Century Southern Literature, Godwin {{was unusual}} in <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> popular novelist {{that was also}} working in academia. Godwin taught at the University of Illinois Center for Advanced Studies from 1971 to 1972. During her time as an author, {{she was also a}} {{lecturer}} at the Iowa Writers' Workshop (1972 to 1973), Vassar College (1977), and Columbia University (1978/1981). She acted as chair of the fiction panel for the National Book Awards in 1986 and 2008. In 1989, Godwin also founded a small publishing house called St. Hilda's Press. It published religious texts not printed by more commercialized publishers. She later became a Distinguished Alumna of the University of North Carolina and the University of Iowa.|$|E
5|$|Although Sadler was a {{committed}} Adventist {{for much of}} his early life, he stayed less involved after John Kellogg was excommunicated in 1907 {{in the wake of a}} conflict with Ellen G. White, the church's founder. The Sadlers became disenchanted with the church and subsequently criticized it. Sadler rejected some Adventist teachings, such as White's status as a prophetess and the importance of Saturday as Sabbath. He retained a positive view of White and rejected allegations <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> charlatan.|$|E
5|$|Aspasia {{was born}} in the Ionian Greek city of Miletus (in the modern {{province}} of Aydın, Turkey). Little is known about her family except that her father's name was Axiochus, although it is evident that she must have belonged to a wealthy family, for only the well-to-do could have afforded the excellent education that she received. Some ancient sources claim <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Carian prisoner-of-war turned slave; these statements are generally regarded as false.|$|E

5|$|Bond beats Le Chiffre at {{the poker}} table, but Lynd is kidnapped by Le Chiffre after the game, as is Bond, who is {{captured}} whilst pursuing them; Lynd is ransomed {{for the money}} and Bond is tortured. Le Chiffre is subsequently killed by Mr. White, a liaison between Le Chiffre {{and a number of}} his clients. Bond learns that his poker winnings were never repaid to the Treasury, which Lynd was supposed to have done, and Bond establishes <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> double agent. Bond pursues her and is attacked by members of White's organisation: he survives, but White takes the money and Lynd sacrifices herself in exchange for Bond's life, as he later finds out from M. Bond subsequently finds and captures White.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{response}} to Billie was mixed; some critics felt <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> strong addition to Charmed while others cited Cuoco's acting and the character's story arc with Christy {{as signs of}} the show's declining quality. After speculation about Billie's possible appearance in a spin-off series, it was confirmed all future plans for the show were canceled following The WB's closure to launch The CW. Cuoco later said that she prefer working on sitcoms over dramatic television shows due to demanding shooting schedule that she experienced while working on Charmed.|$|E
5|$|Eadbald came to {{the throne}} {{on the death of}} his father on 24 February 616, or {{possibly}} 618. Although Æthelberht had been Christian since about 600 and his wife Bertha was also Christian, Eadbald was a pagan. Bertha died some time before Eadbald's accession, and Æthelberht remarried. The name of Æthelberht's second wife is not recorded, but it seems likely <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pagan, since on his death she married Eadbald, her stepson: a marriage between a stepmother and stepson was forbidden by the church.|$|E

5|$|Eberhardt's {{acceptance}} by the Qadiriyya, an Islamic order, convinced the French administration <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> spy or an agitator. She survived {{an assassination attempt}} shortly thereafter. In 1901 the French administration ordered her to leave Algeria, but she was allowed to return the following year after marrying her long-time partner, the Algerian soldier Slimane Ehnni. Following her return, Eberhardt wrote for a newspaper published by Victor Barrucand and worked for General Hubert Lyautey. In 1904, {{at the age of}} 27, she was killed by a flash flood in Aïn Sefra.|$|E
5|$|Following Sévérine's first {{appearances}} in promotional materials for Skyfall, film critics {{noted that the}} character was {{a return to the}} classic elements of the James Bond films, specifically Bond meeting a beautiful and mysterious woman. Critics had a mixed response to Sévérine, comparing her to previous Bond girls. The response to Bond's treatment of Sévérine was largely negative; commentators panned Bond's seduction of the character after discovering <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> sex slave, and his cold response to her death. However, some critics defended Sévérine's story arc as appropriate for Bond's character development. The character has also been a topic of racial criticism, receiving comparisons to previous Bond girls Aki, Kissy Suzuki, and Wai Lin.|$|E
5|$|Gracy Singh as Gauri. Several actresses {{had offered}} {{to act in the}} film, but Aamir needed someone who matched the {{description}} of the character given in the script. After considering Rani Mukerji who did not have dates, Sonali Bendre, Nandita Das and Ameesha Patel for the role, Ashutosh selected Gracy Singh for the female lead because he was convinced <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good actress and dancer and resembled actress Vyjayanthimala.

5|$|Initially, Tarkovsky {{wanted his}} ex-wife, Irma Raush, as Hari. After meeting Swedish actress Bibi Andersson in June 1970, however, he decided <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> better actress for the role. Wishing {{to work with}} Tarkovsky, Andersson {{accepted}} her salary in rubles. Nevertheless, Natalya Bondarchuk was ultimately cast as Hari. Tarkovsky had met her when they were students at the State Institute of Cinematography. It was she who had introduced the novel, Solaris to him. Tarkovsky auditioned her in 1970 but decided she was too young for the part. He instead recommended her to director Larisa Shepitko who cast her in You and I. Half-a-year later, Tarkovsky screened that film and was so pleasantly surprised by her performance {{that he decided to}} cast Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari after all.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{man named}} Father Gregory (Jody Racicot) visits a {{psychiatric}} hospital attempting to visit a girl named Paula Koklos (Perkins), Dara's twin sister. However, he is blocked by Aaron Starkey (Glenn Morshower), a social worker. That night, Paula dies when a man enters her room. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) locates Dara's birth records and reveals <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> quadruplet. Shortly thereafter, Starkey reveals that Paula {{was about to be}} adopted by Father Gregory. When the agents visit the priest, he insists he was trying to protect Paula from harm. Later, while examining Paula's body, Scully experiences a vision of her daughter Emily (Lauren Diewold).|$|E

The Wall Street Journal ran a correction, corroborated by The New York Times, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> resident of Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn at the time. Hagan had lived in six different Brooklyn neighborhoods between her arrival in 2008 and her Miss America victory in 2013, including Sunset Park and Williamsburg.|$|E
