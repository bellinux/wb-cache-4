Section 44 provides that [...] "The Minister may, by an order published in the Gazette" [...] add, remove, or transfer drugs among the classes. The statute's penal provisions are draconian by most nations' standards, providing for long terms of imprisonment, caning, and capital punishment. The law creates a presumption of trafficking for certain <b>threshold</b> <b>amounts,</b> e.g. 30 grams of cannabis. It also creates a presumption that a person possesses drugs if he possesses the keys to a premises containing the drugs, and that [...] "Any person found in or escaping from any place or premises which is proved or presumed {{to be used for}} the purpose of smoking or administering a controlled drug shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have been smoking or administering a controlled drug in that place or premises." [...] Thus, one runs the risk of arrest for drug use by simply being in the company of drug users. The law also allows officers to search premises and individuals, without a search warrant, if he [...] "reasonably suspects that there is to be found a controlled drug or article liable to seizure".

Substratum {{stiffening}} {{promotes the}} quantitative, progressive loss of contact-inhibition of proliferation Cancer progression occurs through multiple genetic and epigenetic perturbations. Elucidating how these perturbations collectively confer selective advantages, such as unconstrained proliferation, {{is central to}} our understanding of disease progression and for developing treatment strategies. Here, we show that (1) there are measurable, quantitative degrees of contact-inhibition of proliferation, and that (2) the stiffening of the microenvironment, a widely observed perturbation during cancer development, promotes a quantitative, progressive loss of contact-inhibition. Even when substratum stiffening has no discernible effect on the phenotype of contact-inhibition, it significantly reduces the <b>threshold</b> <b>amount</b> of EGF needed to transition cells from contact-inhibited to contactindependent proliferation. Thus, the <b>threshold</b> <b>amount</b> of EGF provides a metric of the extent of contact-inhibition.

We try to answer the question if for the determination of <b>threshold</b> <b>amounts</b> in the regulation a mass-based approach can be used for ENM and which major accident scenarios need to be considered for ENM. We performed this assessment using four typical ENM that are covering different classes and that are all produced and used in high quantities: nano-TiO 2, nano-ZnO, carbon nanotube (CNT), and nano-Ag [11].

40|$|Quantitative {{relationships}} between the amounts of encephalitogenic neural tissue and mycobacterial adjuvant are presented for the guinea pig, for comparison with similar results obtained in the mouse and presented in an accompanying paper by Lee and Schneider (27). Definite <b>threshold</b> <b>amounts</b> of both neural encephalitogenic and mycobacterial adjuvant can be defined.

With moderate amounts of encephalitogen the severity and incidence of EAE can be very great, but this encephalitogenic potential can be masked if large amounts of mycobacteria are employed. The mechanism of this masking effect by excess adjuvant is not known, but speculation centers upon the possibility of competition of antigens of the mycobacteria at the expense of those of the encephalitogen...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, one {{meteorological}} {{case study}} for two Iranian airports are presented. Attempts {{have been made}} to study the predefined <b>threshold</b> <b>amounts</b> of some instability indices such as vertical velocity and relative humidity. Two important output variables from a numerical weather prediction model have been used to survey thunderstorms. The climatological state of thunder days in Iran has been determined to aid in choosing the airports for the case studies. The synoptic pattern, atmospheric thermodynamics and output from a numerical weather prediction model have been studied to evaluate the occurrence of storms and to verify the threshold instability indices that are based on Gordon and Albert (2000) and Miller (1972). Using data from the Statistics and Data Center of the Iran Meteorological Organization, 195 synoptic stations were used to study the climatological pattern of thunderstorm days in Iran during a 15 -yr period (1991 – 2005). Synoptic weather maps and thermodynamic diagrams have been drawn using data from synoptic stations and radiosonde data. A 15 -km resolution version of the WRF numerical model has been implemented for the Middle East region with the assistance of global data from University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). The Tabriz airport weather station has been selected for further study due to its high frequency of thunderstorms (more than 35 thunderstorm days per year) and the existence of an upper air station. Despite the fact that storms occur less often at the Tehran weather station, the station has been chosen as the second case study site due to its large amount of air traffic. Using these two case studies (Tehran at 00 : 00 UTC, 31 April 2009 and Tabriz at 12 : 00 UTC, 31 April 2009), the results of this research show that the <b>threshold</b> <b>amounts</b> of 30 °C for KI, − 2 °C for LI and − 3 °C for SI suggests the occurrence and non-occurrence of thunderstorms at the Tehran and Tabriz stations, respectively. The WRF model output of vertical velocity and relative humidity are the two most important indices for examining storm occurrence, and they have a numerical threshold of 1 m s− 1 and 80 %, respectively. These results are comparable to other studies that have examined thunderstorm occurrence...|$|E

Without any additional information, {{it is possible to}} recover an s-sparse signal using m ≳ s (d/s) measurements in a robust and stable way. Some applications provide additional information, such as on the location of the support of the signal. Using this information, it is conceivable the <b>threshold</b> <b>amount</b> of measurements can be lowered. A proposed algorithm for this task is weighted ℓ_ 1 -minimization.
