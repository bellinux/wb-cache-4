40|$|Monotone trends a b s t r a c t We {{consider}} {{a firm that}} periodically procures <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> units, stores them, and processes them into finished products upon order arrivals. <b>The</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> cost evolves in a Markovian fashion, whereas the demand process is influenced by both <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> cost and sales prices charged by the firm. The firm controls both <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> procurement activity and sales price in each period. We show the optimality of base-stock-list-price type of policies with the additional raw-cost dependence. Under conditions that are verifiable when the firm engages in price competition with other firms tapping into <b>the</b> same <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> market and when <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> cost process has time-continuity and mean-reversion tendencies, we identify two monotone patterns in which policy parameters should follow as <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> cost fluctuates.

5|$|Carbon is {{essential}} to all known living systems, and without it {{life as we know}} it could not exist (see alternative biochemistry). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and crude oil (petroleum). Crude oil is distilled in refineries by the petrochemical industry to produce gasoline, kerosene, and other products. Cellulose is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of wood, cotton, linen, and hemp. Cellulose is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool, cashmere and silk. Plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. <b>The</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{major power}} of the cotton {{industry}} {{in the first quarter}} of the 19th century, the Strutts' company began to lose out to competition from Lancashire mill towns. The problem of shifting markets affected the entire Derwent Valley; Lancashire was better situated than Derbyshire in relation to <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> and new markets. The mills run by the Strutt family also suffered from a lack of modernisation; although they were at the forefront of fireproofing technology at the start of the 19th century, as the machines the mills used got bigger and more powerful, the Strutts persevered with child labour where adults would have been more adept at using the machinery. The company declined and in the second half of the 19th century some of its mills were leased or sold off to other companies. Although the cotton industry in the Derwent Valley declined, many of the structures associated with the industrial processes associated with producing cotton and workers' housing has survived and there are 848 listed buildings in the World Heritage Site.|$|E

5|$|During King Richard's reign, the Crown's {{expenditure}} on castles {{declined from}} the levels spent by Henry II, Richard's father, although {{this has been}} attributed to a concentration of resources on Richard's war with the king of France. However, the work at Château Gaillard cost an estimated £12,000 between 1196 and 1198. Richard only spent an estimated £7,000 on castles in England during his reign, similar as his father Henry II. The Pipe rolls for the construction of Château Gaillard contain the earliest details of how work was organised in castle building and what activities were involved. Amongst those workmen mentioned in the rolls are miners, stone cutters, quarrymen, masons, lime-workers, carpenters, smiths, hodmen, water carriers, soldiers to guard the workers, diggers who cut the ditch surrounding the castle, and carters who transported <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> to the castle.

5|$|Halban's {{heavy water}} team from France {{continued}} its slow neutron research at Cambridge University; but {{the project was}} given a low priority since it was not considered relevant to bomb making.

But Sir John Anderson wanted the British team to retain its own identity, and was concerned that since the Americans were working on nuclear reactor designs using nuclear graphite as a neutron moderator instead of heavy water, that team might not receive {{a fair share of}} resources. The Americans had their own concerns, particularly about security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the group was British. They also had concerns about patent rights; that the French team would attempt to patent nuclear technology based on the pre-war work.

5|$|The United States Geological Survey (USGS) {{estimates}} that the annual worldwide production of thallium is about 10metric tonnes as a by-product from the smelting of copper, zinc, and lead ores. Thallium is either extracted from the dusts from the smelter flues or from residues such as slag that are collected {{at the end of}} the smelting process. <b>The</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> used for thallium production contain large amounts of other materials and therefore a purification is the first step. The thallium is leached either by the use of a base or sulfuric acid from the material. The thallium is precipitated several times from the solution to remove impurities. At the end it is converted to thallium sulfate and the thallium is extracted by electrolysis on platinum or stainless steel plates. The production of thallium decreased by about 33% in the period from 1995 to 2009 – from about 15metric tonnes to about 10tonnes. Since there are several small deposits or ores with relatively high thallium content, it would be possible to increase the production if a new application, such as a hypothetical thallium-containing high-temperature superconductor, becomes practical for widespread use outside of the laboratory.|$|E
