One such concern was {{the heat of the}} Abbey, so the designers used special material to absorb the heat while still achieving the desired look.

25|$|Around 80 BC, an Indo-Scythian king named Maues, {{possibly}} a {{general in the}} service of the Indo-Greeks, ruled for a few years in northwestern India before the Indo-Greeks again took control. He seems to have been married to an Indo-Greek princess named Machene. King Hippostratus (65–55 BC) seems to have been one of the most successful subsequent Indo-Greek kings until he lost to the Indo-Scythian Azes I, who established an Indo-Scythian dynasty in 48/47 BC. Various coins seem to suggest <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> alliance may have taken place between the Indo-Greeks and the Scythians.|$|E
25|$|Many other {{physical}} {{systems can be}} modeled as sets of coupled oscillators. The motions of such oscillators can be decomposed into normal modes, like the vibrational modes of a piano string or the resonances of an organ pipe. On the other hand, equipartition often breaks down for such systems, {{because there is no}} exchange of energy between the normal modes. In an extreme situation, the modes are independent and so their energies are independently conserved. This shows <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> mixing of energies, formally called ergodicity, is important for the law of equipartition to hold.|$|E

25|$|The logician Kurt Gödel, on {{the other}} hand, {{believed}} that the characteristica universalis was feasible, and that its development would revolutionize mathematical practice (Dawson 1997). He noticed, however, that a detailed treatment of the characteristica was conspicuously absent from Leibniz's publications. It appears that Gödel assembled all of Leibniz's texts mentioning the characteristica, and convinced himself <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> systematic and conspiratorial censoring had taken place, a belief that became obsessional. Gödel may have failed to appreciate {{the magnitude of the}} task facing the editors of Leibniz's manuscripts, given that Leibniz left about 15,000 letters and 40,000 pages of other manuscripts. Even now, most of this huge Nachlass remains unpublished.|$|E
25|$|The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) was {{prepared}} to fund the entire cost of the network {{over a longer period}} of time. The highest priority was assigned to the Sheppard East, Eglinton Crosstown LRT and Etobicoke-Finch West LRT lines, and to the revitalization of the Scarborough RT line, which was projected to be built by 2020. In addition to the mentioned lines, it was likely <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> link would be established between the two lines, so that they could share a single storage facility. The TTC completed the environmental impact assessments for most of these lines, the first one being completed for the Sheppard East line.

[...] In an October 21, 1863, report to Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, Pollock expressed his own desire to emblazon American coins with a religious motto. The Mint began producing patterns bearing various mottoes, including [...] "God Our Trust" [...] and [...] "In God We Trust"; the latter was ultimately selected, and its first use was on the two-cent piece in 1864.The following year, a law was passed allowing the Treasury to place the motto upon any coin at its discretion. The motto was placed on the silver dollar, as well as various other silver, gold and base metal coins, in 1866.|$|E
500|$|Nominative {{determinism}} is {{the hypothesis}} that people tend to gravitate towards areas of work that fit their names. The term was first used in the magazine New Scientist in 1994, after the magazine's humorous Feedback column noted several studies carried out by researchers with remarkably fitting surnames. These included a book on polar explorations by Daniel Snowman and an article on urology by researchers named Splatt and Weedon. These and other examples led to light-hearted speculation <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> psychological effect was at work. Since the term appeared, nominative determinism has been an irregularly recurring topic in New Scientist, as readers continue to submit examples. Nominative determinism differs from the related concept aptronym, and its synonyms aptonym, namephreak, and Perfect Fit Last Name, in that it focusses on causality. [...] "Aptronym" [...] merely means the name is fitting, without saying anything about why {{it has come to}} fit.|$|E

500|$|On June 11, Flanders {{introduced}} {{a resolution to}} have McCarthy removed as chair of his committees. Although there were many in the Senate who believed <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> disciplinary action against McCarthy was warranted, there was no clear majority supporting this resolution. Some of the resistance was due to concern about usurping the Senate's rules regarding committee chairs and seniority. Flanders next {{introduced a}} resolution to censure McCarthy. The resolution was initially written without any reference to particular actions or misdeeds on McCarthy's part. As Flanders put it, [...] "It was not his breaches of etiquette, or of rules or sometimes even of laws which is so disturbing," [...] but rather his overall pattern of behavior. Ultimately a [...] "bill of particulars" [...] listing 46 charges {{was added to the}} censure resolution. A special committee, chaired by Senator Arthur Vivian Watkins, was appointed to study and evaluate the resolution. This committee opened hearings on August 31.|$|E
500|$|Magic mirrors: In about 800 AD, {{during the}} Tang Dynasty (618–907), a book {{entitled}} Record of Ancient Mirrors described {{the method of}} crafting solid bronze mirrors with decorations, written characters, or patterns on the reverse side that could cast these in a reflection on a nearby surface as light struck the front, polished side of the mirror; due to this seemingly transparent effect, they were called 'light-penetration mirrors' by the Chinese. Unfortunately, this Tang era book was lost over the centuries, but magic mirrors were described in the Dream Pool Essays by the Song dynasty polymath Shen Kuo (1031–1095), who owned three {{of them as a}} family heirloom. Perplexed as to how solid metal could be transparent, Shen guessed <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> quenching technique was used to produce tiny wrinkles {{on the face of the}} mirror too small to be observed by the eye. Although his explanation of different cooling rates was incorrect, he was right to suggest the surface contained minute variations which the naked eye could not detect; these mirrors also had no transparent quality at all, as discovered by British scientist and mathematician William Bragg in 1932.|$|E
500|$|Reactions against Davis {{also came}} from the White House, from Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear, and from {{candidates}} {{in the race for}} the 2016 presidential election. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, [...] "No public official is above the rule of law. Certainly not the president of the United States, but neither is the Rowan County clerk." [...] Governor Beshear said the judge's decision [...] "speaks for itself", while his attorneys called the legal arguments in her suit against him [...] "absurd". Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said, [...] "Officials should be held to their duty to uphold the law– end of story." [...] Several Republican presidential candidates also called on Davis to comply with court orders. Donald Trump said, [...] "the decision's been made, and that is the law of the land." [...] Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida, said Davis [...] "is sworn to uphold the law", but also suggested <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> accommodation be made for her. Republican presidential candidates Carly Fiorina and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina both suggested that Davis should comply with the court order or resign. Members of the Westboro Baptist Church protested against Davis for her multiple divorces and marriages, saying she is living in adultery. Westboro also stated [...] "God hates oath breakers", therefore Davis is obligated to follow the nation's law.|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{used their}} reviews to discuss Spielberg and analyze what the movie {{signified}} in his {{development as a}} filmmaker. Andrew O'Hehir of the online magazine Salon expressed excitement over the atypically hard edge of the movie. [...] "Little Steven Spielberg is all grown up now...into of all things a superior film artist...It's too early to know whether Minority Report, {{on the heels of}} A.I., marks a brief detour in Spielberg's career or a permanent change of course, but either way it's a dark and dazzling spectacle." [...] J. Hoberman of The Village Voice said it is [...] "the most entertaining, least pretentious genre movie Steven Spielberg has made in the decade since Jurassic Park." [...] Randy Shulman of Metro Weekly said that [...] "the movie is a huge leap forward for the director, who moves once and for all into the world of adult movie making." [...] Roger Ebert called the film a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and said that when most directors of the period were putting [...] "their trust in technology", Spielberg had already mastered it, and was emphasizing [...] "story and character" [...] while merely using technology as a [...] "workman uses his tools". David Edelstein of Slate echoed the positive sentiments, saying [...] "t {{has been a long time}} since a Spielberg film felt so nimble, so unfettered, so free of self-cannibalizing." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum, then of the Chicago Reader, was less convinced. Though he approved of the movie, he derided it in his review as a superficial action film, cautioning audiences to enjoy the movie, but not [...] "be conned into thinking <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> serious, thoughtful statement is being delivered along with the roller-coaster ride." ...|$|E
