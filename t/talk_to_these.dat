2500|$|The {{organizers}} of the Winter Soldier Investigation took several steps to ensure {{the validity of the}} participants. [...] Each veteran's authenticity was checked before the hearings by the investigation event organizers, and subsequently by reporters and Pentagon officials. In addition, they also gave specific details about their units and the locations where the events had occurred. [...] Those who wanted to testify were carefully screened by the officers of VVAW, and care was taken to verify the service records and testimony of the veterans. After the severe criticism of the accuracy of Mark Lane's book about atrocities a month before the event, the {{organizers of}} the Winter Soldier Investigation made the credibility of the participants a top priority. [...] As noted by one VVAW leader, [...] "The lesson is that we'd better do our work right. We'd better <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> vets and weed out the bullshitters so that we can't get set up, because we're going to come under attack. [...] We're going to do this right." [...] All veterans participating in Winter Soldier were required to bring their discharge papers (DD-214's) and IDs.|$|E

Inouye figured that the spots of missing vision were connected with the spots that their brain had been shot through, {{and set out to}} map the visual cortex through <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> soldiers.|$|R
5000|$|Detective Michelle Vasey {{has stated}} that not all Juggalos are violent or criminals, and the music is not to blame: [...] "We can't {{necessarily}} say that music's to blame. But I think it definitely does have some influences. As an officer {{we have to decide}} when we're <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> guys, who do we need to worry about and who don't we need to worry about." ...|$|R

He saw there was nothing to be gained by <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> detectives; but he found the {{lieutenant}} equally inclined to doubt his intentions. He, too, only laughed when Billy assured him that he was on his way to the station at the very instant of arrest.|$|R

6000|$|... "Thanks; I guess there's {{nothing you}} can do. <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> frightened girls while I go see what's {{to be done with}} that thick-skulled robber," [...] he replied, and, telling the girls that there was no more danger, he went out.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all right, Beale," [...] I said soothingly. [...] "I know it wasn't your fault, and I know it's hard {{on you to}} have to stop, but I {{wish you}} would go indoors.

You have an idea that all a burglar needs is a mask, a blue chin, and a dark lantern. I tell you he {{requires}} a highly specialized education.

2500|$|Rumours were {{circulating}} at {{this time}} that the Gorillaz team were busy preparing a film, but Hewlett said that the film project had been abandoned: [...] "We lost all interest in doing it as soon as we started meeting with studios and <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> Hollywood executive types, we just weren't on the same page. We said, fuck it, we'll sit on the idea until we can do it ourselves, and maybe even raise the money ourselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, then;" [...] he said, [...] "good-by, dear. Go to your room, {{and keep}} away from your mother, and behave yourself. But wait--put out your tongue.

6000|$|... "Now for it!" [...] said he, {{suddenly}} {{checking his}} horses, and springing {{from his seat}} to the ground.

6000|$|The {{place was}} an {{ordinary}} commercial hotel, clean apparently but otherwise wholly unattractive.

[...] "Thought you might want to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> Press people, perhaps, or do a bit of work. Your secretary's somewhere about the place--turned up with a typewriter early this morning. And there's a young woman--" ...|$|E
60|$|In {{spite of}} the special {{injunctions}} of Mr. O'Conor senior, it was impossible not to loiter for five minutes over the drawing-room fire <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> houris--more especially as I seemed to know them intimately by intuition before half of the five minutes was over.

The men to whom I have been introduced by the other girls have been very few, {{and they have not}} been very nice, and they have not cared for me and I have not cared for them. I think," [...] she said, disconsolately, [...] "I am too small. Every one to-day seems to like big women. Cora Sinclair, who is just behind me in the chorus, gets bouquets every night, and simply chooses with whom she should go out to supper." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{appears that}} all this {{district}} is a great centre {{of what is known}} as 'sweating.' Thus artificial flowers, of which I was shown a fine specimen, a marguerite, are made at a price of 1s. per gross, the workers supplying their own glue. An expert hand, beginning at eight in the morning and continuing till ten at night, can produce a gross and a half of these flowers, and thus net 1s. 6d., minus the cost of the glue, scissors, and sundries. The Officers of the Army find it extremely difficult to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> poor people, who are invariably too busy to listen. Therefore, some of them have learnt how to make artificial flowers themselves, so that when they call they can join in the family manufacture, and, while doing so, carry on their conversation.|$|E
6000|$|When he was gone, Barrow {{walked the}} floor a good while, uneasy in his mind. He said to himself, [...] "I'm troubled about him. He {{never would have}} made a break like that if he hadn't been a little off his balance. But I know what being out of work and no {{prospect}} ahead can do for a man. First it knocks the pluck out of him and drags his pride in the dirt; worry does the rest, and his mind gets shaky. I must <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> people. No--if there's any humanity in them--and there is, at bottom-- they'll be easier on him if they think his troubles have disturbed his reason. But I've got to find him some work; work's the only medicine for his disease. Poor devil! away off here, and not a friend." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'September 19th.--Here we are becalmed; {{for three}} days we have {{scarcely}} made ten miles in the direction we want to go. It is not prudent to go near the large island, unless {{we have a good}} breeze, and can get away from the fleets of canoes if we see reason for so doing. We may have one hundred and fifty canoes around us, and perhaps sixty or eighty strong men on deck, as we had last year; and this year we have good reason for fearing that labour vessels have been here. Many of the people here would distinguish between us and them; but it is quite uncertain, for we can't talk {{to the people of the}} large island, and can't therefore explain our object in so doing. 'Yesterday, being becalmed, a large canoe, passing (for there was occasionally a light air from the north) from Nupani to Santa Cruz, came near us. It could not get away, and the [...] "Southern Cross" [...] could not get near it. So we went to it in the boat. I can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> Nupani people, and we had a pleasant visit.

60|$|If we do {{not take}} to our aid the foregone studies of men reputed {{intelligent}} and learned, we shall be always beginners. But men must learn somewhere; and the new teachers mean no more than what they effect, {{as far as they}} succeed,--that is, to deprive men of the benefit of the collected wisdom of mankind, and to make them blind disciples of their own particular presumption. <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> deluded creatures (all the disciples and most of the masters) who are taught to think themselves so newly fitted up and furnished, and you will find nothing in their houses but the refuse of Knaves' Acre,--nothing but the rotten stuff, worn out in the service of delusion and sedition in all ages, and which, being newly furbished up, patched, and varnished, serves well enough for those who, being unacquainted with the conflict which has always been maintained between the sense and the nonsense of mankind, know nothing of the former existence and the ancient refutation of the same follies. It is near two thousand years since it has been observed that these devices of ambition, avarice, and turbulence were antiquated. They are, indeed, the most ancient of all commonplaces: commonplaces sometimes of good and necessary causes; more frequently of the worst, but which decide upon neither. Eadem semper causa, libido et avaritia, et mutandarum rerum amor. Ceterum libertas et speciosa nomina pretexuntur; nec quisquam alienum servitium, et dominationem sibi concupivit, ut non eadem ista vocabula usurparet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Woman," [...] {{said the}} President, [...] "by a great {{majority}} of this Court {{we have come to}} an irrevocable decision upon the matter that has been laid before it by our brother Ithiel. It is, for reasons which I need not explain, that on this point our rule may be stretched so far as to admit the child Miriam to our care, even though it be of the female sex, which care is to endure until she comes to a full age of eighteen years, when she must depart from among us. During this time no attempt will be made to turn her from her parents' faith in which she has been baptised. A house will be given you to live in, and you will be supplied with the best we have for the use of our ward Miriam and yourself. Twice a week a deputation of the curators will visit the house, and stay there for an hour to see that the health of the infant is good, and that you are doing your duty by it, in which, if you fail, you will be removed. It is prayed that you will not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> curators on matters which do not concern the child. When she grows old enough the maid Miriam will be admitted to our gatherings, and instructed also by the most learned amongst us in all proper matters of letters and philosophy, on which occasions you will sit at a distance and not interfere unless your care is required.|$|E

I saw poor Paraday wedge himself, by command, into the little supplementary seat of a brougham in which the Princess and our hostess were already ensconced. If the front glass isn’t open on his dear old back perhaps he’ll survive. Bigwood, I believe, is very grand and frigid, all marble and precedence, and I wish him well out of the adventure. I can’t tell you how much more and more your attitude to him, {{in the midst of all}} this, shines out by contrast. I never willingly <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> people about him, but see what a comfort I find it to scribble to you! I appreciate it—it keeps me warm; there are no fires in the house. Mrs. Wimbush goes by the calendar, the temperature goes by the weather, the weather goes by God knows what, and the Princess is easily heated. I’ve nothing but my acrimony to warm me, and have been out under an umbrella to restore my circulation. Coming in an hour ago I found Lady Augusta Minch rummaging about the hall. When I asked her what she was looking for she said she had mislaid something that Mr. Paraday had lent her. I ascertained in a moment that the article in question is a manuscript, and I’ve a foreboding that it’s the noble morsel he read me six weeks ago. When I expressed my surprise that he should have bandied about anything so precious (I happen to know it’s his only copy—in the most beautiful hand in all the world) Lady Augusta confessed to me that she hadn’t had it from himself, but from Mrs. Wimbush, who had wished to give her a glimpse of it as a salve for her not being able to stay and hear it read.|$|E
