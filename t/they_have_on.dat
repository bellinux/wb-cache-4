5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based system where each unit {{on both sides}} is given their chance to move and act. Characters move and attack within the same turn, {{and in a few}} cases units can take two moves in a turn. A key part of combat is the Weapons Triangle, a new {{addition}} which governs the opposing strengths and weaknesses of weapon types based on a rock–paper–scissors system - lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. A secondary system governs the magic system, where Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying strengths and weaknesses against each other. Each unit has a character class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, how much effect <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> other units, which latent skills they possess, and whether they use passive or aggressive skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse {{have little}} {{interaction}} with people, primarily because most species live in arid unpopulated areas and at low densities. They are not generally sought after as game birds {{as they are}} not especially palatable, although <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> occasion been taken in great numbers at water holes. An attempt to introduce them into Nevada failed {{but they have been}} introduced to Hawaii. No species is considered to be threatened although there have been some localised range contractions, particularly in Europe. A subspecies of the chestnut-bellied sandgrouse, P. e. floweri, was last seen in the Nile Valley of Egypt in 1979. It is thought to be extinct, but the reasons for this are unknown.|$|E
5|$|During an interview, Satoh said Rurouni Kenshin {{was one of}} {{the first}} manga he read to the point he would play sword-fights with his friends. Additionally, once he was cast as Kenshin, Satoh started intense swordsmanship training. Satoh said he liked Kenshin's {{character}} to the point of enjoying role in the three films. However, the actor expressed pressure in doing the role as a result of having to take part in multiple fighting scenes. Nevertheless, Satoh said he enjoyed Kenshin's lines due to the impact <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> most characters, most notably his enemies. Due to the Kyoto films showing a darker characterization of Kenshin as he struggles against different strong rivals, Satoh also said his work became more challenging. Still, he found it interesting. A scene that Satoh enjoyed was Kenshin's fight against Sawagejō Chō due to the fact Kenshin is forced to attack his enemy even though he does not know his weapon is deadly which goes against his morals; as a result, Satoh briefly showed Kenshin's hitokiri side for a brief moment. The actor said he discussed this scene with the director who pleased with the result. Kenshin's strongest technique, the Amakakeru Ryū no Hirameki, was Satoh's favorite move as he likes its meaning. While Kenshin shouts his attacks' names in both manga and anime, Satoh instead decided to say the names after performing those moves.|$|E

5|$|Units {{each have}} a {{character}} class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, and how much effect <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> other units, whether they used passive or aggressive skills. There are thirty classes available to choose from: these include mounted units such as the Pegasus Knight, Sorcerers and Healers that wield magic for attack and healing respectively, soldiers who wield swords and axes, and archers who specialize in long distance attacks. The only class that is character exclusive is the Lord class, which is used by Marth. Limitations are placed on how many of one class {{can be used in}} a single battle. When a unit has reached Level 10, their class can be evolved along a select number of routes using an item called a Master Seal. Units can also be re-classed, changing to a completely different class or back to their original class at the player's discretion: the re-class options has limits as there are only a limited number of available classes for a unit to change into. If a class change is reversed, all the unit's previous stats will be retained. Each unit's weapon, which is directly associated with its class, has its level raised based on the amount of usage, while also decreasing its durability — unless merged with another identical item, the weapon will break after its maximum number of uses.|$|E

25|$|A {{decoupling}} capacitor is a capacitor {{used to protect}} {{one part of a}} circuit from the effect of another, for instance to suppress noise or transients. Noise caused by other circuit elements is shunted through the capacitor, reducing the effect <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> the rest of the circuit. It is most commonly used between the power supply and ground.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the Sami people's existence was documented by such writers as the Roman historian Tacitus. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> uncertain grounds, but for a very long time, been associated with the Fenni.

25|$|Generalist herbivores {{are more}} likely than specialists to be {{negatively}} affected by the defense chemicals that endophytes produce because <b>they</b> <b>have,</b> <b>on</b> average, less resistance to these specific, qualitative defenses. Among the chewing insects, infection by mycorrhizae can actually benefit specialist feeders even if it negatively affects generalists. The overall pattern of effects on insect herbivores seems to support this, with generalist mesophyll feeders experiencing negative effects of host infection, although phloem feeders appear to be affected little by fungal defenses.|$|E

25|$|Body {{modification}} enthusiasts have {{experimented with}} magnetic implants {{to attempt to}} replicate this sense. However, in general humans (and it is presumed other mammals) can detect electric fields only indirectly by detecting the effect <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> hairs. An electrically charged balloon, for instance, will exert a force on human arm hairs, which can be felt through tactition and identified as coming from a static charge (and not from wind or the like). This is not electroreception, {{as it is a}} post-sensory cognitive action.|$|E

In 2006, Bronfenbrenner brought more than 550 trade unionists and scholars from 53 countries to discuss union initiatives in strategic corporate research, global organizing and global collective bargaining campaigns; exchange research on the changing nature of multinational corporate ownership and governance structures, human resources practices, and business strategies; and to discuss ways in which labor unions and academics could work together to enhance their understanding of multinational corporations.|$|E
25|$|In {{northwest}} America, {{salmon is}} a keystone species, {{which means the}} impact <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> other life is greater than would be expected {{in relation to their}} biomass. The death of the salmon has important consequences, since it means significant nutrients in their carcasses, rich in nitrogen, sulfur, carbon and phosphorus, are transferred from the ocean to terrestrial wildlife such as bears and riparian woodlands adjacent to the rivers. This has knock-on effects not only {{for the next generation of}} salmon, but to every species living in the riparian zones the salmon reach. The nutrients can also be washed downstream into estuaries where they accumulate and provide much support for estuarine breeding birds.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century, the Right {{had shifted}} {{to support the}} newly rich in some European {{countries}} (particularly England) and instead of favouring the nobility over industrialists, favoured capitalists over the working class. Other right-wing, such as Carlism in Spain and nationalist movements in France, Germany and Russia, remained hostile to capitalism and industrialism. However, {{there are still a}} few right-wing movements today, notably the French Nouvelle Droite, CasaPound and American paleoconservatives, that are often in opposition to capitalist ethics and the effects <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> society as a whole, which they see as infringing upon or causing the decay of social traditions or hierarchies that they see as essential for social order.|$|E
25|$|Introduction of miR-1 and miR-133a into an {{embryonal}} rhabdomyosarcoma-derived {{cell line}} is cytostatic, which suggested a strong tumour-suppressive role for these microRNAs. Expression of miR-1 but not miR-133a gave transcriptional profiles that {{were consistent with}} a strong promyogenic influence on the cells, again demonstrating the role of miR-1 in muscle differentiation from precursor stem cells. The authors propose that miR-1 and miR-133a act to repress isoforms of genes that are not normally expressed in muscle cells. All of these observations suggest that mis-regulation of miR-1 and miR-133a can result in tumorogenesis via abolition of the suppressive effect <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> certain gene targets and of {{the removal of the}} promotion of differentiation of the cells exerted my miR-1.|$|E
25|$|Ramsay has {{presented}} five series of a food-based magazine programme titled The F Word; it launched on Channel4 on 27 October 2005. The show is organised around several key, recurring features, notably a brigade competition, a guest cook competition, a food related investigative report and a series-long project of raising animals {{to be served}} in the finale. The guest cook (usually a celebrity) prepares a dish of their own choosing and places it in competition against a similar dish submitted by Ramsay. The dishes are judged by diners who are unaware of who cooked which dish and, if the guest wins (as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> numerous occasions), their dish is served at Ramsay's restaurant.|$|E
