5|$|Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., an {{investment}} bank on the 101st–105th {{floors of the}} North Tower, lost 658 employees, considerably {{more than any other}} employer. Marsh Inc., located immediately below Cantor Fitzgerald on floors 93–100, lost 358 employees, and 175 employees of Aon Corporation were also killed. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated that about 17,400 civilians were in the World Trade Center complex {{at the time of the}} attacks. Turnstile counts from the Port Authority suggest 14,154 people were typically in <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> <b>Towers</b> by 8:45a.m. Most people below the impact zone safely evacuated the buildings.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of tons of toxic debris containing more than 2,500 contaminants, including known carcinogens, were spread across Lower Manhattan due to the collapse of <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> <b>Towers.</b> Exposure to the toxins in the debris is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses among people who were at ground zero. The Bush administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks, citing national security, but the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to pre-September 11 levels until June 2002.|$|E

5|$|Over time, {{numerous}} structural modifications {{were made}} to suit the needs of tenants in <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> <b>Towers.</b> Modifications were made {{in accordance with the}} Port Authority's Tenant Alteration Review Manual and were reviewed by the Port Authority to ensure the changes did not compromise structural integrity of the buildings. In many instances, openings were cut in the floors to accommodate new stairways to connect tenant floors. Some steel beams in the core were reinforced and strengthened to accommodate heavy live loads, such as large amounts of heavy files that tenants had on their floors.|$|E
5|$|On {{a typical}} weekday, a {{combined}} total of 50,000 people {{worked in the}} North and South Towers, with another 200,000 passing through as visitors. The complex was so large that it had its own zip code: 10048. The Windows on the World restaurant, located {{on top of the}} North Tower, reported revenues of $37 million in 2000, making it the highest-grossing restaurant in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>Twin</b> <b>Towers</b> became known worldwide, appearing in movies, television shows, postcards, and other merchandise.

5|$|At the north-west {{corner of}} the walls stands Arundel tower, another large drum tower that {{originally}} overlooked a small cliff. South of this is Catchcold tower. Catchcold tower {{was designed to be}} defended with guns and has three gunports; the need to support cannon leaves it much heavier in appearance than the other circular towers on the walls. The remains of machine gun mountings fitted to the tower in 1941 can still be seen. The Arcades form part of the surviving west walls and are a unique feature in England; their closest architectural equivalent are in Rouen, France. The West Gate still stands three storeys high and was originally defended by two portcullises; the windows {{on the west side of}} the gate are the original medieval designs. Along the south side of the walls one of <b>the</b> <b>twin</b> <b>towers</b> protecting the South Gate still stands, largely intact.|$|E

5|$|Entering the 21st century, {{progress}} continued despite several disasters. The September 11 attacks {{resulted in}} service disruptions on lines running through Lower Manhattan, particularly the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, which ran directly underneath the World Trade Center. Sections of the tunnel, {{as well as}} the Cortlandt Street station, which was directly underneath <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> <b>Towers,</b> were severely damaged. Rebuilding required the suspension of service on that line south of Chambers Street. Ten other nearby stations were closed for cleanup. By March 2002, seven of those stations had reopened. The rest (except for Cortlandt Street on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line) reopened on September 15, 2002, along with service south of Chambers Street. In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc, flooding several underwater tunnels and other facilities near New York Harbor, as well as trackage over Jamaica Bay. The immediate damage was fixed within six months but long-term resiliency and rehabilitation projects continue.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the World Trade Center, of which <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> <b>Towers</b> (One and Two World Trade Center) were the centerpieces, was conceived as an urban renewal project and spearheaded by David Rockefeller. The project was intended to help revitalize Lower Manhattan. The project was planned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which hired architect Minoru Yamasaki. Yamasaki {{came up with the}} idea of building twin towers. After extensive negotiations, the New Jersey and New York State governments, which supervise the Port Authority, consented to the {{construction of}} the World Trade Center at the Radio Row site, located in the lower-west area of Manhattan. To satisfy the New Jersey government, the Port Authority agreed to buy the bankrupt Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (renamed to Port Authority Trans-Hudson), which transported commuters from New Jersey to Lower Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} <b>the</b> <b>twin</b> <b>towers,</b> spires and west front of St John's Cathedral, Parramatta, in Sydney, Australia, which were added in 1817–1819, {{is based on}} those of St Mary's Church at Reculver. Efforts to save St Mary's Church were still under way when Governor Lachlan Macquarie and his wife Elizabeth left England for Australia in 1809. Elizabeth Macquarie asked John Watts, the governor's aide-de-camp from 1814 to 1819, to design the towers for St John's Cathedral, and these, {{together}} with its west front, are the oldest remaining parts of an Anglican church in Australia, and are on the oldest site of continuous Christian worship there. In 1990 a stone from Reculver was presented to St John's Cathedral by the Historic Building and Monuments Commission for England, now English Heritage.|$|E

5|$|This match {{marked the}} end of the feud between Hulk Hogan and André the Giant that had {{dominated}} WWF programming for over 18 months though the two would face off several more times In single matches that October. The two would face off for the last time 6 months later, just weeks prior to Wrestlemania VI when the then-WWF World Tag Team Champions The Colossal Connection Andre and Haku faced then-WWF World Champion Hulk Hogan and the Big Boss man at a house show. In the weeks after the match, André feuded with other upper-card wrestlers such as Savage and Jake Roberts.

5|$|At 8:32a.m., FAA {{officials}} were notified Flight 11 had been hijacked and {{they in turn}} notified the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). NORAD scrambled two F-15s from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts and they were airborne by 8:53a.m. Because of slow and confused communication from FAA officials, NORAD had 9minutes' notice that Flight 11 had been hijacked, and no notice {{about any of the}} other flights before they crashed. After both of <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> <b>Towers</b> had already been hit, more fighters were scrambled from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia at 9:30a.m. At 10:20a.m. Vice President Dick Cheney issued orders to shoot down any commercial aircraft that could be positively identified as being hijacked. These instructions were not relayed in time for the fighters to take action. Some fighters took to the air without live ammunition, knowing that to prevent the hijackers from striking their intended targets, the pilots might have to intercept and crash their fighters into the hijacked planes, possibly ejecting at the last moment.|$|E

The September 11 attacks {{interrupted}} the season, and the resumption of baseball in New York became a symbol of how the city recovered from the destruction of <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> <b>Towers.</b> After falling behind 2–0 in the ALDS against the Athletics, the Yankees won three straight contests to advance to the ALCS. They prevailed in five games against the Seattle Mariners, who had tied a single-season MLB record with 116 regular season wins, for the team's fourth straight AL pennant. The Arizona Diamondbacks gained a two-game lead in the 2001 World Series before the Yankees won three consecutive ballgames; New York home runs with two outs in the ninth inning of Games 4 and 5 led to extra inning wins in both games, with Game 4 ended by a Jeter home run. The Yankees' championship streak ended, though, as the Diamondbacks won the Series in seven games with a late rally in the final inning of Game 7.|$|E

5|$|With Spider-Man cast, filming was set {{to begin}} the {{following}} November in New York City and on Sony soundstages. The film was set for release a year later, but when the film was postponed to be released on May 3, 2002, filming officially began on January 8, 2001 in Culver City, California. After {{the terrorist attacks on}} September 11, 2001, certain sequences were re-filmed, and images of <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> <b>Towers</b> were digitally erased from the film. Sony's Stage 29 was used for Peter's Forest Hills home, and Stage 27 was used for the wrestling sequence where Peter takes on Bonesaw McGraw (Randy Savage). Stage 27 was also used for the complex Times Square sequence where Spider-Man and the Goblin battle for the first time, where a three-story set with a breakaway balcony piece was built. The scene also required shooting in Downey, California. On March 6, forty-five-year-old construction worker Tim Holcombe was killed when a forklift modified as a construction crane crashed into a construction basket that he was in. The following court case led to the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health to fine Sony $58,805.|$|E
