5|$|According to {{the film}} {{historian}} Randor Guy, Pelli Chesi Choodu {{was the first in}} a series of satirical comedies directed by Prasad and produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios. Guy said the film's box office performance made Prasad famous in both Telugu and Tamil cinema. After Pelli Chesi Choodu, Prasad and Vijaya Vauhini Studios collaborated on Missamma (1955) and Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu (1959). All three films were profitable ventures and achieved cult status in Telugu cinema. Pelli Chesi Choodu is considered as one of the acclaimed films in the careers of Prasad and Varalakshmi. Relangi Narasimha Rao's 1988 Telugu film, which was also about the negative effects of dowry system in India, was titled Pelli Chesi Choodu. Pelli Chesi Choodu was also used as the <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 2014 theatrical play staged by Sri Sai Arts, which won a Nandi Award.|$|E
5|$|Docter {{began work}} on the film that would become Monsters, Inc. in 1996 while others focused on A Bug's Life (1998) and Toy Story 2 (1999). Its code name was Hidden City, named for Docter's {{favorite}} restaurant in Point Richmond. By early-February 1997, Docter had drafted a treatment together with Harley Jessup, Jill Culton, and Jeff Pidgeon that bore some resemblance to the final film. Docter pitched the story to Disney with some initial artwork on February 4 that year. He and his story team left with some suggestions in hand and returned to pitch a refined {{version of the story}} on May 30. At this pitch meeting, longtime Disney animator Joe Grant– whose work stretched back to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)– suggested the title Monsters, Inc., a play on the <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gangster film Murder, Inc., which stuck. The film marks the first Pixar feature to not be directed by Lasseter instead being helmed by Docter, as well as Lee Unkrich and David Silverman who served as co-directors.|$|E

5|$|Pope John XXIII issued eight Papal Encyclicals {{during his}} five-year reign as Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, from his {{election}} on October 28, 1958 {{until his death}} on June 3, 1963. Two of his encylicals, Mater et magistra and Pacem in terris, are especially important. A Papal Encyclical is a letter sent by the Pope which is addressed to Roman Catholic bishops {{in a particular area}} or the whole world. Encyclicals may condemn errors, point out threats to faith and morals, exhort faithful practices, or provide remedies for present and future dangers to the church. The authority of the encyclical varies depending on the circumstances and is not necessarily ex cathedra. The <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Papal Encyclical is usually taken from its first few words.|$|E

Sennett offered Smith a chance to go with him when he started the company Keystone Studios, but he declined the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|Shadows Fall {{was formed}} in 1995 by guitarists Jonathan Donais and Matt Bachand, then good friends from the local music scene. Bachand had {{previously}} been {{a founding member of}} a death metal band and Donais a member of the metalcore band Aftershock. By 1996 the band had found a complete lineup with the addition of Damien McPherson (vocals), Mark Laliberte (bass), and David Germain (drums). Also in 1996, Adam Dutkiewicz performed live drums to fill in for Germain. By late 1996, the band recorded and released a demo titled Mourning a Dead World, of which only about 200 copies were produced. It consisted of the songs Lifeless, Suffer the Season, Fleshold, Forever Lost, A Souls Salvation, and Deadworld. McPherson decided to leave the band, and was replaced by Philip Labonte in 1997. Around the same time, bass guitarist Paul Romanko, formally of the hardcore band Pushbutton Warfare, was recruited as a permanent replacement for Laliberte, who had originally joined on a temporary basis. Now with a more solid lineup, the band released its first EP, To Ashes, with Dutkiewicz playing as a session drummer. The band's name, according to Bachand, comes from the <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> comic book published in the early 1990s.|$|E
