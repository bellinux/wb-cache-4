Document-oriented databases {{are one of the}} main categories of NoSQL databases, and the popularity of the term [...] "document-oriented database" [...] has grown {{with the use of the}} term NoSQL itself. XML databases are a subclass of document-oriented databases that are optimized to work with XML documents. Graph databases are similar, but add another layer, the relationship, which allows them <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>documents</b> for rapid traversal.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. agroXML is a {{standardized}} language for data exchange in agriculture. It {{is based on}} the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) us-ing XML Schema as its definition language. agroXML is used to submit data from farm management information systems to external partners, like e. g. product processing industries in the food supply chain or agri-cultural service providers. In addition, data about operating supplies like fertilizers or pesticides can be made available to the farmer by their re-spective suppliers. In the future, using XML linking technologies might provide a dynamic and flexible mechanism <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>documents</b> to such external information sources. ...|$|E

40|$|Assessing {{semantic}} {{similarity between}} text documents {{is a crucial}} aspect in Information Retrieval systems. In this work, we propose to use hyperlink information to derive a similarity measure that can then be applied to compare any text documents, with or without hyperlinks. As <b>linked</b> <b>documents</b> are generally semantically closer than unlinked documents, we use a training corpus with hyperlinks to infer a function a, b → sim(a, b) that assigns a higher value <b>to</b> <b>linked</b> <b>documents</b> than <b>to</b> unlinked ones. Two sets of experiments on different corpora show that this function compares favorably with OKAPI matching on document retrieval tasks. Categories and Subject Descriptors...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, the {{increasing}} amount of collaboratively created content is hardly accessible for analysis with traditional technology {{because it is}} normally unstructured information. At the same time such content {{becomes more and more}} business relevant because it is heavily used in daily work processes and business decision making. The ability <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>documents</b> with weakly structured and structured information allows a new generation of sensemaking algorithms to extract meaning from a nearly unmanageable amount of data. For this reason, SAP Research is working towards an internal project to extract meaning from unstructured data using semantic technologies. Because of the huge amount of source data, the motivation of this thesis is to accelerate the unstructured information processing by using the cloud-based technologies. In additional, the SLA (Service Level Agreement) will also be introduced to fulfill the potential business requirements...|$|E
40|$|The {{editors of}} this special edition {{originally}} asked if institutional repositories are shaping and changing scholarly communications. While the Open Access movement has had a profound impact, {{there is at least}} one area where repositories are not. While repositories are Web-based, they almost always contain only print-oriented materials which are not fully realizing the fabric of the Web and its ability <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>documents</b> to each other and to data. This article will explore some of the factors that have contributed to this print-dominated situation and then report on work undertaken at the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) to make repositories more Web-like, using a publishing system which was originally devised at the university for publishing course materials to multiple formats. The article concludes with a description of a new model for changing scholarship by focusing on post-graduate theses and new journals in an open access context. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Relationships are {{keys to the}} {{semantics}} {{and hence}} the Semantic Web. One interesting way to exploit relationships is <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>documents</b> such that terms in the documents are semantically related through well defined relationships. In his 1945 article, Dr. Vannevar Bush posited {{the idea of creating}} a device capable of recording all of human knowledge. Dr. Bush suggested that such a device would allow its user to traverse a space of documents by following a “trail of associations ” in the user’s mind. The assumption however is that links of the Web are meaningful to the user. This assumption certainly does not hold for the eight billion pages on the Web. We consider a scenario where the user has some prior knowledge of the domain. Our approach to building such a system relies on two aspects of Semantic Web: (a) semantic metadata for documents, and (b) populated ontology with relationship instances...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the state-of-the-art of World Wide Web management. We first identify {{a set of}} requirements {{for the management of}} the Web. Based on these requirements, we present the relevant Internet standards defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and we compare them with approaches that use the Web itself to make management information available. We evaluate both approaches against the identified requirements and we conclude with remarks how both approaches should evolve in the future. 1. Introduction The World Wide Web is in wide-spread use today and many people and organizations, among them the organizers of this workshop, rely on its correct operation. The success of the Web is largely based on the development of a common naming scheme which allows <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>documents</b> of arbitrary types together. The complexity of the technology underlying the Web has increased in the last years, {{while at the same time}} the accessibility, usability and reliability of the Web beca [...] ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{approach}} to automatic creation of anchor texts for hyper-links in a document pointing to similar doc-uments. Methods used in this approach rank parts of a document based on the similarity to a presumably related document. Ranks are then used to automatically construct the best anchor text for a <b>link</b> inside original <b>document</b> <b>to</b> the compared document. A number of dif-ferent methods from information retrieval and natural language processing are adapted for this task. Automatically constructed anchor texts are manually evaluated in terms of relat-edness <b>to</b> <b>linked</b> <b>documents</b> and compared <b>to</b> baseline consisting of originally inserted an-chor texts. Additionally we use crowdsourc-ing for evaluation of original anchors and au-tomatically constructed anchors. Results show that our best adapted methods rival the preci-sion of the baseline method. ...|$|R
