The Aria Boulevard interchange was first planned in 2005, and was completed without using any federal funding.|$|E

5|$|The Commandos on Campbeltown now disembarked: two assault teams, five {{demolition}} {{teams with}} their protectors and a mortar group. Three demolition teams were tasked with destroying the dock pumping machinery and other installations {{associated with the}} dry dock. The kilt-wearing Captain Donald Roy – 'The Laird' – and his 14-man assault troop were tasked with knocking out two pump-house roof-top gun emplacements high above the quayside and securing a bridge to provide a route for the raiding parties <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> the dock area. Roy and Sgt Don Randall used scaling ladders and grenades to accomplish the former, and a head-on rush to secure the bridge and form a bridgehead that enabled Capt. Bob Montgomery and Lt Corran Purdon and their demolition teams <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> the area.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland State Highway Administration {{transferred}} {{maintenance of}} Queens Chapel Road from MD 410 to US 1 {{to the town}} of University Park in August 1988 ahead of the construction of the Washington Metro's Green Line underneath the town; the town subsequently closed the road through town. A 1991 traffic study showed the majority of traffic along the University Park segment of Queens Chapel Road was through traffic before it was closed, and recommended the highway be closed {{at the southern end of}} town and only allow traffic <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> the town onto US 1. After Metro construction was completed in the summer of 1992, the University Park Town Council elected to keep the road closed to through traffic; this measure was affirmed by a town referendum in January 1993. Today, there is a cul-de-sac at the southwest end of town adjacent to the MD 500MD 410 intersection; the intersection with US 1 at the northeast end of town only allows traffic <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> Queens Chapel Road.|$|E

More specifically, the study compares risk factors associated with joining gangs and barriers <b>to</b> <b>exiting</b> gangs between youth who grow up in a middle-class “suburban” environment and the available research, which has predominantly been focused on youth who grow up in a “poor” underprivileged environment. The study found no distinguishing risk factors between the participants and the available data. In addition, the study also examined whether there are any unique risk factors encountered by youth who were raised in Canada by foreign born parents. The research found no unique risk factors associated with joining and obstacles <b>to</b> <b>exiting</b> among this group either...|$|R

50|$|One {{difference}} of the predecessor Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis {{is that all}} of the end of level bonuses are now required. In the previous game, extra points were earned by getting all Minis <b>to</b> the <b>exit,</b> getting them <b>to</b> the <b>exit</b> with no long time intervals between any two Minis, and getting them <b>to</b> the <b>exit</b> without stopping any of them. In Minis March Again, the door is boarded up and the player fails the level if any Minis don't make it <b>to</b> the <b>exit</b> within a few seconds of another Mini getting <b>to</b> the <b>exit,</b> and none of the minis may be stopped or turned directly by the player. Only items and obstacles can be used to control their direction.|$|R

5|$|According to setup {{coordinator}} Douglas Cook, the rehearsals {{enabled them}} to reduce the setup time to under five minutes. Cook, who had worked on previous halftime shows, understood the details and guided the team. Drawings of the performances depicted what was expected for each setup, with the volunteers assembling the stage in segments and moving them to the field with carts. Madonna's entrance had to be rehearsed several times for coordination. Although Cook learned during the game that the New England Patriots were scheduled <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> on the route used by volunteers carrying the stage equipment, he resolved the issue by talking with the team.|$|E

Even though his show-and-tell {{presentation}} is well received by the class, the dog escapes into the school air ducts to follow the food scent coming from the kitchen and is spotted by Ralph. Groundskeeper Willie is sent after the dog and catches it, but he chooses the wrong vent <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> and the fire department is called in to rescue him. As the firemen are attempting to rescue Willie, an outraged Superintendent Chalmers appears and fires Principal Skinner, much to Bart's shock.|$|E

Damage reports from the Philippines remained scarce, though the PAGASA indicated that damage costs totaled 67.250million Philippine pesos (US$1.26million). On July18, an Airbus A330-242 carrying 242passengers bound for Hong Kong encountered Koni in the South China Sea and attempted to deviate from its planned trajectory in order to avoid severe weather. However, the plane inadvertently encountered an area of severe turbulence, resulting in three minor injuries on board. The plane was later able <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> the area of turbulence and land safely at Hong Kong International Airport.|$|E

Giving Austria huge subsidies came back to haunt France. It could not bolster defences in New France; the British easily captured Louisbourg in 1758, {{and went on to}} conquer all of New France.|$|E
