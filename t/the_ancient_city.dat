The game is set across several locations on the fictional Mount Olympus, including the Tomb of Ares, <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> of Olympia, the Path of Eos, the Labyrinth, several areas of the Palace of the Gods, such as the Forum and Hera's Gardens, and the Underworld and Tartarus.|$|E
5|$|From 2000 {{excavations}} {{carried out}} by University College London and the Moroccan Institut National des Sciences de l'Archéologie et du Patrimoine {{under the direction of}} Elizabeth Fentress, Gaetano Palumbo and Hassan Limane revealed what should probably be interpreted as the headquarters of Idris I just below the walls of the Roman town to the west of <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> centre. Excavations within the walls also revealed a section of the early medieval town. Today, many artefacts found at Volubilis can be seen on display in the Rabat Archaeological Museum.|$|E
5|$|Olga Tufnell (26 January 1905 – 11 April 1985) was a British {{archaeologist}} who assisted on {{the excavation}} of <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> of Lachish in the 1930s. She had no {{formal training in}} archaeology, but {{had worked as a}} secretary for Flinders Petrie {{for a number of years}} before being given a field assignment. Olga then went on to join James Leslie Starkey in the expedition to find Lachish in 1929 and remained part of the team for the following seasons.|$|E

5|$|Such {{names have}} {{remained}} in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries. Since 1965 Greater London has been divided into 32 London boroughs in addition to <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>City</b> of London. The City of London is the main financial district, and Canary Wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the Docklands to the east.|$|E
5|$|The Polonnaruwa Vatadage {{is located}} in a quadrangular area known as the Dalada Maluva in <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> of Polonnaruwa. The Dalada Maluva {{contains}} some of the oldest and most sacred monuments of the city. The Polonnaruwa Vatadage, which occupies most of the south western area of it, is a prominent structure among them. It is the best preserved example of a Vatadage in the country, and is somewhat similar in design to those belonging to the Anuradhapura period, especially Thuparamaya and Lankaramaya.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> of Sarapion is {{believed}} to have been the predecessor state of Mogadishu. It is mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a Greek travel document dating from the first century AD, as one of a series of commercial ports on the Somali littoral. According to the Periplus, maritime trade already connected peoples in the Mogadishu area with other communities along the Indian Ocean coast.|$|E

5|$|The {{residents}} of <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> of Jeitun, which dates to 6000 BC, kept {{sheep and goats}} as their primary livestock. There have also been numerous identifications of Nomadic pastoralism in archaeological sites, identified by a prevalence of sheep and goat bones, a lack of grain or grain-processing equipment, very limited architecture showing a set of characteristic traits, a location outside the region's zone of agriculture, and ethnographic analogy to modern nomadic pastoral peoples.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Starkey secured {{funding from}} Charles Marston and Henry Wellcome {{to start an}} {{expedition}} apart from the Petries, which Olga joined. The Wellcome-Marston expedition was {{to focus on the}} excavation of <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> of Lachish, a stronghold mentioned in the Bible. Over the next six years, the team made some important finds, including the Lachish letters, but the work was interrupted by the murder of Starkey, while he was en route to the opening of the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. The remaining team finished during the 1938/9 season, then closed the site. Olga wrote the final report.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Soviet {{scientist}} Victor Cherdyntsev, who {{had previously}} claimed the existence of primordial curium-247, claimed to have discovered element 108 (specifically, the 267Hs isotope, which supposedly had a half-life of 400 to 500million years) in natural molybdenite and suggested the name sergenium (symbol Sg; at the time, this symbol {{had not yet been}} taken by seaborgium) for it, after <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> of Serik along the Silk Road in Kazakhstan where his molybdenite samples came from. His rationale for claiming that sergenium was the heavier homologue to osmium was that minerals supposedly containing sergenium formed volatile oxides when boiled in nitric acid, similarly to osmium. His findings were criticized by V. M. Kulakov on the grounds that some of the properties Cherdyntsev claimed sergenium had were inconsistent with the then-current nuclear physics.|$|E

5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, {{the city walls}} shaped the route of Canterbury's modern ring road system, {{protecting}} the inner core of <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>city,</b> despite proposals under the Holden Plan of 1945 for a radical reshaping of the city's road network. During the 1950s, a stretch of Canterbury's walls were reconstructed, including two circular towers, {{as part of the}} redevelopment of the St George district. In the early 1980s, the volume of traffic around the West Gate was causing damage to the structure of the building. The remaining walls and West Gate are protected under UK law as scheduled monuments and as a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{returns to}} his {{teaching}} position at a New England college, where he is interviewed by two Army Intelligence agents.

The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> of Tanis in Egypt, and that he possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant – the Nazis believe that if they acquire the Ark, their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra {{is the key to}} finding the Well of Souls, a secret chamber in which the Ark is buried.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ancient</b> <b>City</b> of Damascus, {{including}} the citadel, {{was listed as}} a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979.

Until 1999, the restorations were carried out by the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums (DGAM). In 1999 a joint French-Syrian mission was initiated {{under the supervision of the}} DGAM and the Institut français du Proche-Orient (IFPO). Between 2000 and 2006, this mission carried out extensive archaeological and art-historical research in the citadel, as well as further restoration works. In celebration of these restorations, a ceremony was held on 1 July 2006 which was attended by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.|$|E

5|$|The Firebrand is an 1987 {{historical}} fantasy {{novel by}} American author Marion Zimmer Bradley. Set in <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> of Troy, {{the novel is}} a re-telling of Homer's epic poem, the Iliad.

As in the Iliad, Kassandra foresees catastrophe for her city but few pay heed to her warnings. In Bradley's story, Kassandra is presented as a strong and insightful woman, rather than as a sufferer of insanity.|$|E

5|$|After {{collecting}} {{all four}} artefacts, Lara travels to Antarctica and discovers that Dr. Willard {{had been using}} the knowledge gained from the meteorite to perform experiments on his own men, turning them into horrible mutations. Angered by this revelation, she confronts Dr. Willard, who reveals that he is planning to encourage the mutations, only on a global scale, using the combined power of the artefacts and the meteorite from which they were carved. As Lara voices her opposition to his operation, Willard betrays her, steals the artefacts, and disappears into the excavation site. After fighting more mutants and navigating the treacherous ruins of <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> built atop the meteorite crater, Lara faces Willard, who has now used {{the power of the}} four artefacts to greatly speed up the evolutionary processes of the human body and thereby turned himself into a spider-like creature. Lara deactivates the meteorite by recovering the artefacts, kills the mutated Willard, and escapes by helicopter.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Marie urged Ferdinand to ally himself with the Triple Entente and declare war on Germany, which he eventually did in 1916. During {{the early stages of}} fighting, Bucharest was occupied by the Central Powers and Marie, Ferdinand and their five children took refuge in Moldavia. There, she and her three daughters acted as nurses in military hospitals, caring for soldiers who were wounded or afflicted by cholera. On 1 December 1918, the province of Transylvania, following Bessarabia and Bukovina, united with the Old Kingdom. Marie, now queen of Greater Romania, attended the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, where she campaigned for international recognition of the enlarged Romania. In 1922, she and Ferdinand were crowned in a specially-built cathedral in <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> of Alba Iulia, in an elaborate ceremony which mirrored their status as queen and king of a united state.|$|E
5|$|Shooting in Venice {{took place}} on August 8. For scenes such as Indiana and Brody {{greeting}} Elsa, shots of the boat chase, and Kazim telling Indiana where his father is, Robert Watts gained control of the Grand Canal from 7 am to 1 pm, sealing off tourists {{for as long as}} possible. Cinematographer Douglas Slocombe positioned the camera to ensure no satellite dishes would be visible. San Barnaba di Venezia served as the library's exterior. The next day, filming moved to <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> of Petra, Jordan, where Al Khazneh (The Treasury) stood in for the temple housing the Grail.
