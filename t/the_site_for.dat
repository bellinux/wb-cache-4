5|$|Construction of the Green Line past Anacostia Station was {{complicated}} by {{the discovery of a}} potential toxic waste site {{in the path of the}} subway. In June 1991, WMATA discovered that the District of Columbia had dumped 426,000 tons of possibly hazardous incinerator bottom ash in an unused exposed culvert along the subway's potential path near St. Elizabeth's Hospital between 1977 and 1989. The city continued to dump the ash at <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>for</b> four years after it learned that WMATA planned to use <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>for</b> the Green Line. Experts were concerned that the ash dump contained pockets of methane gas and soluble acid, which would make the site unusable by Metrorail.|$|E

Our results indicate that transcription activation at Class I promoters, irrespective of the distance between <b>the</b> DNA <b>sites</b> <b>for</b> CAP and RNA polymerase, requires the activating region of the promoter-proximal subunit of CAP. In striking contrast, our results indicate that transcription activation at Class II promoters requires the activating region of the promoter-distal subunit of CAP...|$|R

5|$|A {{parliamentary}} {{inquiry and}} media reports {{indicated that the}} Indigenous traditional owners of Muckaty Station were divided over whether it should host a radioactive waste facility.

Political scientist Rebecca Stringer criticised the federal government's approach to the siting of the waste facility, arguing that it undermined the Indigenous owners' sovereignty and control of their own lands.

At the ceremony, Patio 29 was described {{as a symbol of the}} country's painful history and an educational place for human rights. As a national monument, the site will be conserved and maintained by government funds unless ordered otherwise by the courts. It is the first cemetery to become a national monument in Chile.|$|E

To prevent the LSWR from {{exploiting}} its monopoly on access to the cemetery, the private Act of Parliament authorising the scheme bound the LSWR to carry corpses and mourners to the cemetery in perpetuity and set a maximum tariff which could be levied on funeral traffic, but did not specify details of how the funeral trains were to operate.|$|E

5|$|From {{the start}} of the 18th century onwards, the garden went through major changes as it fell into neglect.

5|$|In 1818, Jennings began {{promoting}} a large-scale plan for internal {{improvements in the}} state.

After Indianapolis became <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>for</b> the state's permanent capital in 1821 and new settlers arrived in the area, the Indiana General Assembly appropriated $100,000 for new road construction and improvements {{to some of the}} more important routes, but it was considerably short of the amount needed.|$|E
