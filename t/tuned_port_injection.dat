L69 production was stopped, leaving the LG4 as the only remaining carbureted V8 used in the F-body. Trans Am GTA (Gran Turismo Americano) was introduced, available with the LB9 305 TPI engine (which was returned to 205 hp) or the L98 350 TPI.

In {{order to have a}} precise control of hydrogen flow and to avoid the backfire and pre-ignition problems hydrogen was injected into the intake system. Experiments were conducted to determine the optimized injection timing, injection duration and injection quantity of the fuel in manifold and port injected hydrogen-operated engine using diesel as ignition source for hydrogen operation.

In <b>port</b> <b>injection</b> technique, the optimized condition was start of injection at 5 o before gas exchange top dead centre (5 o BGTDC) with injection duration of 30 o CA with hydrogen flow rate of 7. 5 litres/min. With the above optimized timings of <b>port</b> and manifold <b>injection</b> it was observed that brake thermal efficiency in <b>port</b> <b>injection</b> increases by 13 % and 16 % in manifold injection at 75 % load.

The optimum minimum value of BSFC occurred within a range AFR from 38. 14 (φ= 0. 9 to 42. 91 (φ= 0. 8) for selected range of speed.

40|$|Increasing {{concerns}} over energy security and stricter legislation on automotive exhaust emission limits have triggered greater efforts in utilizing alternatives to petroleum-based fuels.

In this paper, methane, the major constituent of natural gas (NG), in used to fuel a Ricardo E 6 engine and run in a <b>port</b> <b>injection</b> operation with open-valve and close-valve injection. The compression ratio is set at 10. 5 : 1. Methane at 30 bar was supplied to the injector and injection length was adjusted to achieve the desired air fuel ratio (AFR). The minimum advance for best torque (MBT) was determined for 1100 rpm speed by measuring the indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) for combustion at spark advance between 14 °CA and 35 °CA BTDC. The result is clearly demonstrated that the performance of the open valve <b>port</b> <b>injection</b> (OVPI) is superior to the one of the close valve <b>port</b> <b>injection</b> (CVPI) with better IMEP, fuel conversion efficiency, indicated power and volumetric efficiency. The observation indicates that OVPI shows steadiness of peak pressures shifts toward top dead centre (TDC) as spark ignitions were advanced compared to CVPI. In terms of combustion characteristics, the OVPI operation yields shorter ignition delay and overall burning duration even at the same phasing angle. Therefore, the open valve operation is preferable for NG <b>port</b> <b>injection</b> {{due to the fact that}} injections take place while intake valve is open.
