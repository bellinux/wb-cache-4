5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{is highly}} {{volatile}} and penetrates skin readily, {{and is very}} <b>toxic</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation,</b> ingestion, and skin contact. Airborne low concentrations of osmium tetroxide vapor can cause lung congestion and skin or eye damage, and should therefore {{be used in a}} fume hood. Osmium tetroxide is rapidly reduced to relatively inert compounds by polyunsaturated vegetable oils, such as corn oil.|$|E
25|$|Thiomersal is very <b>toxic</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation,</b> ingestion, and {{in contact}} with skin (EC hazard symbol T+), with a danger of {{cumulative}} effects. It is also very toxic to aquatic organisms and may cause long-term adverse effects in aquatic environments (EC hazard symbol N). In the body, it is metabolized or degraded to ethylmercury (C2H5Hg+) and thiosalicylate.|$|E
25|$|Methyl {{isocyanate}} (MIC) {{is extremely}} toxic. The {{threshold limit value}} set by the American Conference on Government Industrial Hygienists is 0.02 ppm. MIC is <b>toxic</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation,</b> ingestion and contact in quantities as low as 0.4 ppm. Exposure symptoms includes coughing, chest pain, dyspnea, asthma, irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, as well as skin damage. Higher levels of exposure, over 21 ppm, can result in pulmonary or lung edema, emphysema and hemorrhages, bronchial pneumonia and death. Although the odor of methyl isocyanate cannot be detected at 5 ppm by most people, its potent lachrymal properties provide an excellent warning of its presence (at a concentration of 2–4 parts per million (ppm) subject's eyes are irritated, while at 21 ppm, subjects could not tolerate the presence of methyl isocyanate in air).|$|E

50|$|While this {{chemical}} has {{not been}} confirmed to be a carcinogen, exposure to this chemical causes irritation to the respiratory system and skin. Additionally, acetyl cyanide is <b>toxic</b> <b>by</b> both <b>inhalation</b> and ingestion. Furthermore, this compound may be toxic to aquatic organisms, possibly causing long-term adverse effects in the aquatic environment.|$|R
2500|$|Aniline is <b>toxic</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> of the vapour, ingestion, or {{percutaneous}} absorption. [...] The IARC lists it in Group 3 (not classifiable {{as to its}} carcinogenicity to humans) due to {{the limited}} and contradictory data available. [...] The early manufacture of aniline resulted in increased incidents of bladder cancer, but these effects are now attributed to naphthylamines, not anilines.|$|E
2500|$|Two arsenic {{pigments}} {{have been}} widely used since their discovery – Paris Green and Scheele's Green. After the toxicity of arsenic became widely known, these chemicals were used less often as pigments and more often as insecticides. In the 1860s, an arsenic byproduct of dye production, London Purple was widely used. [...] This was a solid mixture of arsenic trioxide, aniline, lime, and ferrous oxide, insoluble in water and very <b>toxic</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> or ingestion But it was later replaced with Paris Green, another arsenic-based dye. With better understanding of the toxicology mechanism, two other compounds were used starting in the 1890s. Arsenite of lime and arsenate of lead were used widely as insecticides until the discovery of DDT in 1942.|$|E
2500|$|The U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) {{has set a}} 15-minute {{exposure}} limit for gaseous ammonia of 35 ppm by volume in the environmental air and an 8-hour {{exposure limit}} of 25 ppm by volume. NIOSH recently reduced the IDLH from 500 to 300 based on recent more conservative interpretations of original research in 1943. IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health) is the level to which a healthy worker can be exposed for 30 minutes without suffering irreversible health effects. Other organizations have varying exposure levels. U.S. Navy Standards [...] maximum allowable concentrations (MACs):continuous exposure (60 days): 25 ppm / 1 hour: 400 ppm Ammonia vapour has a sharp, irritating, pungent odour {{that acts as a}} warning of potentially dangerous exposure. The average odour threshold is 5 ppm, well below any danger or damage. Exposure to very high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can result in lung damage and death. Although ammonia is regulated in the United States as a non-flammable gas, it still meets the definition of a material that is <b>toxic</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> and requires a hazardous safety permit when transported in quantities greater than 13,248 L (3,500 gallons). Household products containing ammonia (i.e., Windex) should never be used in conjunction with products containing bleach, as the resulting chemical reaction produces highly toxic fumes.|$|E
50|$|Metal carbonyls are <b>toxic</b> <b>by</b> skin contact, <b>inhalation</b> or ingestion, in {{part because}} of their ability to carbonylate {{hemoglobin}} to give carboxyhemoglobin, which prevents the binding of O2.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lethal dose}} for a 70 kg (154 lb) human is {{estimated}} at 5-10 g. [...] Sodium fluoride is classed as <b>toxic</b> <b>by</b> both <b>inhalation</b> (of dusts or aerosols) and ingestion. [...] In high enough doses, {{it has been shown}} to affect the heart and circulatory system. For occupational exposures, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have established occupational exposure limits at 2.5 mg/m3 over an eight-hour time-weighted average.|$|R

2500|$|... 1,2-Dichloroethane is <b>toxic</b> (especially <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> due to {{its high}} vapour pressure), highly flammable, and {{possibly}} carcinogenic. Its high solubility and 50-year half-life in anoxic aquifers make it a perennial pollutant and health risk that is very expensive to treat conventionally, requiring a method of bioremediation. [...] While the chemical is not used in consumer products manufactured in the U.S., a case was reported in 2009 of molded plastic consumer products (toys and holiday decorations) from China that released 1,2-dichloroethane into homes at levels high enough to produce cancer risk.|$|R
50|$|Cacodylic acid {{is highly}} <b>toxic</b> <b>by</b> ingestion, <b>inhalation,</b> or skin contact. Once {{thought to be}} a {{byproduct}} of inorganic arsenic detoxification, it is now believed to have serious health consequences of its own. It {{has been shown to be}} teratogenic in rodents, most often causing cleft palate but also fetal fatality at high doses. It has been shown to be genotoxic in human cells, causing apoptosis and also decreased DNA production and shorter DNA strands. While not itself a strong carcinogen, cacodylic acid does promote tumors in the presence of carcinogens in organs such as the kidneys and liver.|$|R
50|$|Mercury {{occurs in}} {{deposits}} {{throughout the world}} mostly as cinnabar (mercuric sulfide). The red pigment vermilion is mostly obtained by reduction from cinnabar. Cinnabar is highly <b>toxic</b> <b>by</b> ingestion or <b>inhalation</b> of the dust. Mercury poisoning can also result from exposure to water-soluble forms of mercury (such as mercuric chloride or methylmercury), inhalation of mercury vapor, or eating seafood contaminated with mercury.|$|R

5000|$|In acute {{toxicity}} studies using laboratory animals, paraquat {{has been shown}} to be highly <b>toxic</b> <b>by</b> the <b>inhalation</b> route and has been placed in Toxicity Category I (the highest of four levels) for acute inhalation effects. However, the EPA has determined that particles used in agricultural practices (400 to 800 μm) are well beyond the respirable range and therefore inhalation toxicity is not a toxicological endpoint of concern. Paraquat is <b>toxic</b> (Category II) <b>by</b> the oral route and moderately <b>toxic</b> (Category III) <b>by</b> the dermal route. Paraquat will cause moderate to severe eye irritation and minimal dermal irritation, and has been placed in Toxicity Categories II and IV (slightly toxic) respectively for these effects.|$|R

50|$|Mercury can be inhaled and absorbed {{through the}} skin and mucous membranes, so {{containers}} of mercury are securely sealed to avoid spills and evaporation. Heating of mercury, or compounds of mercury that may decompose when heated, is always carried out with adequate ventilation {{in order to avoid}} exposure to mercury vapor. The most toxic forms of mercury are its organic compounds, such as dimethylmercury and methylmercury. However, inorganic compounds, such as cinnabar are also highly <b>toxic</b> <b>by</b> ingestion or <b>inhalation</b> of the dust. Mercury can cause both chronic and acute poisoning.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} l-(di) halo- 2 -fluoroethanes {{reported}} in the literature to be nontoxic or of low toxicity were found to be highly <b>toxic</b> <b>by</b> the <b>inhalation</b> route.

It is also corrosive - contact with the eyes can lead to severe irritation or burns. Typical threshold limit value (above which the substance is harmful) is 0.15 mg/m3.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of exposure include: nervousness/restlessness, miosis (contraction of the pupil), rhinorrhea (runny nose), excessive salivation, dyspnea (difficulty in breathing due to bronchoconstriction/secretions), sweating, bradycardia (slow heartbeat), loss of consciousness, convulsions, flaccid paralysis, loss of bladder and bowel control, apnea (breathing stopped) and lung blisters. The exact {{symptoms of}} overexposure {{are similar to}} those created by all nerve agents. Tabun is toxic even in minute doses. The number and severity of symptoms which appear vary according to the amount of the agent absorbed and rate of entry of it into the body. Very small skin dosages sometimes cause local sweating and tremors accompanied with characteristically constricted pupils with few other effects. Tabun is about half as <b>toxic</b> as sarin <b>by</b> <b>inhalation,</b> but in very low concentrations it is more irritating to the eyes than sarin. Also, tabun breaks down slowly, which after repeated exposure can lead to build up in the body.|$|R
