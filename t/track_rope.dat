It was built in 1970 by the Swiss manufacturer Habegger Engineering Works and opened on 21 July 1971. Its two cabins can carry 25 people each, plus the cabin attendant. Each cabin travels up and down along its own <b>track</b> <b>rope</b> at a maximum speed of 5m/s (18km/h, 984ft/min) over an inclined length of 341m (1118ft).

The track ropes have a diameter of 40mm, the haul rope connecting the two cabins via the drive bull wheel in the [...] upper terminal has a diameter of 19mm and its counter rope 15mm. The track ropes are anchored in the upper terminal and are tensioned by two concrete blocks of 42 tons each suspended inside the lower terminal where the blocks have a leeway of 7.9m to move up and down. The haul rope and its counter rope are tensioned by a counterweight of 3.5 tons, also in the lower terminal. The max output of the motor is 140 HP (104kW).

40|$|In the paper, {{traditional}} hypotheses of cableways engineering regarding wind {{action are}} checked using a numerical procedure which considers a 3 -D wind field, its variability {{in space and}} time and the aerodynamic forces due to exposure of both the <b>track</b> <b>rope</b> and the passengers- vehicle to the wind flow. The aim is to capture the buffeting response and aeroelastic phenomena, such as galloping, due to ice accretion. The <b>track</b> <b>rope</b> is modelled by cable finite elements directly formulated in the global frame of reference. Aerodynamic forces on cables are computed from sectional forces according to the quasi-static theory. The passengers-cabin is considered stationary along the <b>track</b> <b>rope</b> and is modelled as a rigid body formulated adopting a finite-rotation kinematics; the aerodynamic forces due to the wind acting on the cabin surfaces are also considered. The static configuration of the system is computed adopting the dynamic relaxation technique while standard step-by- step procedure, with Newton-Raphson type iterations for equilibrium correction, is used for integrating the equations of motion...|$|E

40|$|End-to-end {{distortion}} estimation {{is critical}} to effective errorresilient video coding. The recursive optimal per-pixel estimate (ROPE) is a known approach to compute up to second moments of decoder-reconstructed pixels, and thereby optimally estimate the distortion. ROPE accurately accounts for encoding/decoding operations that are recursive in the pixel domain, and their interaction with packet loss and decoder concealment. The premise of this work is that considerable gains could be recouped by a dual estimation technique that would perform its recursion in the transform domain. This {{opens the door to}} accurate distortion estimation in conjunction with estimation-theoretic source coding approaches that involve transform domain operations, including improved prediction in both single-layer and scalable video coding. We present a novel recursive optimal estimate that operates entirely in the transform domain, namely, the spectral coefficient-wise optimal recursive estimate (SCORE). The method overcomes intricacies due to motion compensation from “off-grid ” blocks. We first demonstrate that its accuracy matches ROPE in the usual setting where ROPE is known to be optimal. Then we consider an enhanced encoding scenario involving spectral operations that cannot be accurately <b>tracked</b> by <b>ROPE,</b> but for which SCORE still maintains optimality and hence enables substantial end-to-end performance gains over a large range of packet loss rates.
