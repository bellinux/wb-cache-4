He also recognised <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>element</b> within the inspiration noting the differences in the canonical gospels. Zwinglianism is the Reformed confession based on the Second Helvetic Confession promulgated by Zwingli's successor Heinrich Bullinger in the 1560s.|$|E

Some animals, such as several species of waterfowl, show strong avoidance behaviors toward humans and any form of human disturbance. No matter how nice an urban park is built, the proximity of humans will scare away some birds. Other species must maintain large territories, and barriers that abound in human habitats, such as roads, will stop them from coexisting with humans. These animals will require undisturbed land set aside for them.|$|E

500|$|The {{inspiration}} of scripture, {{the concept that}} God or the Holy Spirit is the author, was taken for granted by Zwingli. His view of inspiration was not mechanical and he recognized <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>element</b> in his commentaries as he noted {{the differences in the}} canonical gospels. He did not recognize the apocryphal books as canonical. Like Martin Luther, Zwingli did not regard the Revelation of St John highly, and also did not accept a [...] "canon within the canon", but he did accept scripture as a whole.|$|E
500|$|Addressing his approach, Weisman {{said that}} {{eliminating}} <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>element</b> eliminated the [...] "fear factor" [...] {{that people are}} doing something wrong or that they will die; {{it is meant to}} be read as a fantasy, according to the author. Josie Appleton of Spiked related the book to [...] "today's romanticisation of nature" [...] in that it linked [...] "the decadence and detachment of a modern consumerist society" [...] with an ignorance of the efforts required to produce products so easily disposed. Appleton also felt the book countered the [...] "Nature knows best" [...] notion by highlighting the randomness of natural forces.|$|E

[...] Walker highlighted the way that Lord had avoided telling the story {{through the prism of}} social class, which had been the usual style of previous narratives, and instead successfully depicted <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>element</b> of the story by showing how those aboard reacted to the disaster whatever their class.|$|E

[...] However, he feels it is sure to amaze its audience. A Chicago Sun-Times reviewer describes it as a scholarly product that is [...] "easily the most comprehensive reference book on the Chicago region ever published". The State Journal-Register, the Springfield, Illinois newspaper, reviewers complain that downstate cities and regions are neglected in the book. A Daily Herald review describes it as a book accurately [...] "billed as the city's most definitive historical reference book".

500|$|Hill began {{recording}} The Miseducation in late 1997 at Chung King Studios in New York City, {{and completed}} it in June 1998 at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica. In an interview, Hill described {{the first day}} of recording, stating: [...] "The first day in the studio I ordered every instrument I ever fell in love with: harps, strings, timpani drums, organs, clarinets. It was my idea to record it so <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>element</b> stayed in. I didn't want it to be too technically perfect." [...] Initially, Jean did not support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered to help as a producer, which she did not accept. Aside from doing work at Chung King Studios, Hill also recorded at Perfect Pair Studios in New Jersey, as well as Sony Studios, with some songs having different elements recorded at different studios. The bulk of the album, however, was recorded at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, the studio built by reggae musician Bob Marley. Regarding this shift in environment, Hill stated: [...] "When I started recording in New York and New Jersey, lots of people were talking to me about going different routes. I could feel people up in my face, and I was picking up on bad vibes. I wanted a place where there was good vibes, where I was among family, and it was Tuff Gong." [...] Many members of the Marley family were present in the studio during the recording sessions, among them Julian Marley, who added guitar elements to [...] "Forgive Them Father." ...|$|E

[...] Continued Dargis: There is much else to say about the movie, which ends with the harrowing siege of Bin Laden's hideaway by the Navy SEALs (played by, among others, Joel Edgerton and Chris Pratt), much of it shot to approximate the queasy, weirdly unreal green of night-vision goggles. Ms. Bigelow's direction here is unexpectedly stunning, at once bold and intimate: she has a genius for infusing even large-scale action set pieces with <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>element.</b> One of the most significant images is of a pool of blood on a floor. It's pitiful, really, and as the movie heads toward its emphatically non-triumphant finish, it is impossible not to realize with anguish that all that came before– the pain, the suffering and the compromised ideals– has led to this.|$|E
2500|$|Gibson's {{script was}} mockingly {{summed up by}} him as [...] "Space commies hijack alien eggs – big problem in Mallworld". The story picked up after Aliens, with the Sulaco {{drifting}} into an area of space claimed by the [...] "Union of Progressive Peoples". The ship is boarded by people from the U.P.P., who are attacked by a facehugger hiding in the entrails of Bishop's mangled body. The soldiers blast the facehugger into space and take Bishop with them for further study. The Sulaco then arrives at a space station-shopping mall hybrid named Anchorpoint. With Ripley put in a coma, Hicks explores the station and discovers Weyland-Yutani are developing an Alien army. In the meantime, the U.P.P. are doing their own research, which led them to repair Bishop. Eventually Anchorpoint and the U.P.P stations are overrun with the Aliens, and Hicks must team up with the survivors to destroy the parasites. The film ends with a teaser for a fourth movie, where Bishop suggests to Hicks that humans are united against a common enemy, and they must track the Aliens to their source and destroy them. The screenplay was very action oriented, featuring an extended cast, and is considered in some circles as superior to the final film and has a considerable following on the Internet. The producers were on the whole unsatisfied with the screenplay, which Giler described as [...] "a perfectly executed script that wasn't all that interesting", particularly for not taking new directions with the initial pitch. They still liked certain parts, such as the subtext making the Alien {{a metaphor for the}} HIV, but felt it lacking <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>element</b> present in Aliens and Gibson's trademark cyberpunk aesthetic. Following the end of the WGA strike, Gibson was asked to make rewrites with Harlin, but declined, citing various other commitments and [...] "foot dragging on the producers' part." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{originally}} developed for a Canadian audience, {{it was announced}} on January 29, 2008 that American network CBS had purchased the rights to air the series in the United States, making it the first Canadian TV series aired in primetime on a US broadcast network since Due South, also a CTV show aired by CBS. In addition, Flashpoint is the first Canadian series aired by a major U.S. broadcast network set entirely in Canada (as Due South was primarily set in Chicago but filmed in Toronto). On March 5, 2008, CBS announced that Flashpoint would premiere in July. CTV announced on May 8, 2008 that it would simulcast the show in Canada beginning on July 11. Flashpoint began filming 13 episodes on April 17, 2008. It was written and created by Mark Ellis and Stephanie Morgenstern and executive produced by multiple Gemini Award-winner Anne Marie La Traverse for Pink Sky Entertainment and Bill Mustos for Avamar Entertainment, {{in association with the}} CTV Television Network and CBS Television Studios (formerly CBS Paramount Network Television). The pilot episode, titled [...] "Scorpio" [...] was based on an actual event that occurred in Toronto in 2004, in which a gun-wielding hostage-taker was shot and killed by an Emergency Task Force (TPS) sniper. Ellis and Morgenstern wrote their teleplay for the episode after interviewing members of the ETF. The majority of the episode reused substantial portions of the unaired Critical Incident pilot together with new footage featuring Amy Jo Johnson and Mark Taylor (who were not in the pilot). Director David Frazee carefully shot the SRU as one unit to demonstrate their unity. Producer Anne Marie La Traverse said the show would take people to their [...] "own personal flash point." [...] David Paetkau, one of the show's regular cast members, said Flashpoint [...] "tries to capture <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>element</b> involved in policing, and discusses how some officers end up with emotional baggage and suffer with mental illnesses like post traumatic stress disorder." [...] Input and advice from various ETF personnel were used in making the series.|$|E
