500|$|The {{surveying}} crew of Allexey W. Von Schmidt {{conducted the}} first systematic traverse of {{any part of}} the Yosemite area backcountry in 1855, when it extended an approximation of the Mount Diablo Baseline eastward from a point west of the present park boundary, to a point south of Mono Lake. [...] The actual route taken was 5 to 6 miles south of the actual baseline, due to topographic difficulties, including the Tuolumne River canyon at low elevations, and steep mountain slopes higher up. [...] Nevertheless, this was the first straight line survey made across the Sierra Nevada From 1879 to 1883 large parts of the western half of the park were surveyed as part of the General Land Office survey. However, the individual contracted for the largest area, one S. A. Hanson, was later listed among those associated with the Benson Syndicate, and he combined actual with probably fabricated surveys. [...] <b>Topographic</b> <b>surveys</b> performed by Lieutenant Montgomery M. Macomb, under George M Wheeler's Surveys West of the 100th Meridian, were completed in the late 1870s and early 1880s.|$|E

40|$|In this decade, {{terrestrial}} {{laser scanner}} (TLS) is getting popular in many {{fields such as}} reconstruction, monitoring, surveying, as-built of facilities, archaeology, and <b>topographic</b> <b>surveying.</b> This is due the high speed in data collection which is about 50, 000 to 1, 000, 000 three-dimensional (3 D) points per second at high accuracy. The main advantage of 3 D representation for the data {{is that it is}} more approximate to the real world. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} show the use of High-Definition Surveying (HDS), also known as 3 D laser scanning for <b>topographic</b> <b>survey.</b> This research investigates the effectiveness of using terrestrial laser scanning system for <b>topographic</b> <b>survey</b> by carrying out field test in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), Skudai, Johor. The 3 D laser scanner used in this study is a Leica ScanStation C 10. Data acquisition was carried out by applying the traversing method. In this study, the result for the <b>topographic</b> <b>survey</b> is under 1 st class survey. At the completion of this study, a standard of procedure was proposed for topographic data acquisition using laser scanning systems. This proposed procedure serves as a guideline for users who wish to utilize laser scanning system in <b>topographic</b> <b>survey</b> fully. ...|$|R
