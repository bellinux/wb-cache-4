5|$|Toward this end, in {{the early}} November 1798, Jourdan arrived in Hüningen, near the Swiss city of Basel, to take command of <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> of Observation, {{so-called}} because its function was to observe {{the security of the}} French border on the Rhine. Once there, Jourdan assessed the quality and disposition of the forces and identified needed supplies and manpower. He found <b>the</b> <b>army</b> woefully inadequate for its assignment. <b>The</b> <b>Army,</b> and its flanking armies, <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> of Helvetia (Switzerland) and <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> of Mayence, were equally short of manpower, supplies, ammunition, and training. Jourdan documented assiduously these shortages, pointing out in lengthy correspondence to the Directory the consequences of an under-manned and under-supplied army; his petitions seemed to have little effect on the Directory, which sent neither significant additional manpower nor supplies.|$|E
5|$|A {{study from}} June 15, 1945, by the Joint War Plans Committee, who {{provided}} planning {{information to the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff, estimated that Olympic would result in between 130,000 and 220,000 U.S. casualties, of which U.S. dead {{would be in the}} range from 25,000 to 46,000. Delivered on June 15, 1945, after insight gained from the Battle of Okinawa, the study noted Japan's inadequate defenses due to the very effective sea blockade and the American firebombing campaign.
