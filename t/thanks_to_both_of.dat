40|$|It {{appears to}} be {{customary}} to begin by thanking one’s supervisor. But I find it superfluous, particularly since Professor A. K. Roy means much {{more to me than}} merely my supervisor. After all, one normally doesn’t thank his parents for holding his hands when he is taking his first faltering steps, for teaching him to walk. Though I consider this entire thesis as a kind of joint venture, Prof. Roy has allowed me to pass much of it as my own. For the records, only the materials of Chapter 3 have so far appeared as a joint paper, which too he has permitted me to include in this thesis without any questions asked. I joined this Institute as a student more than a decade ago. The list of teachers who have taught me, nurtured me, encouraged me, made me what I am today, is naturally bound to read like the whole faculty list. To each of them I owe a lot and it is impossible for me to choose only few of them for special mention. The same is also true for the numerous friends and colleagues in the hostel, the division or outside. Each of them contributed in making this place my “home away from home”, gave me much-needed moral support. I thank them all. In the initial days of my research, I had good fortune of many fruitful discus-sions with Prof. D. van Dulst of University of Amsterdam and Dr. T. S. S. R. K.

40|$|In {{most states}} with market {{oriented}} economic systems privatisation {{plays an important}} role in the political discussion, mainly due to the fundamental problem of all economic systems, which is scarcity of available resources. The responsible politicians try to improve the allocation of scarce resources and to increase the financial possibilities for needed development investments by creating an adequate macroeconomic framework and a business-friendly environment. Within the scope of these efforts the production of goods and commercial services by state-owned enterprises only plays a very limited role. The state would be best advised to leave these functions to the, in this regard, more efficient private sector. The public sector should concentrate its respective efforts only on the production of so-called Public Goods and, for political reasons, eventually on some sub-sectors, which are essential for the security of the country. Nearly all market economies and especially states which are in the transitional process from more centrally administered to market oriented economic systems, have room for manoeuvre towards privatisation of state-owned enterprises. Privatisation facilitate the improvement of factor allocation and the reduction of budget constraints, not only by the way of sales revenues but also by creating a broader tax-base, decreasing the need to provide subsidies and, last but not least, mobilising private resources for the aimed development-process. This is also true for the Republic of India as well as for the Federal Republic of Germany. However, privatisation causes not only advantages for the economic systems and the public budgets, but also some economic and financial costs. These costs have to be reduced as much as possible by an efficient target-oriented policy. Although the corresponding policies and experiences in one country can hardly be a blueprint for another country, a policy-dialogue at various levels about privatisation and on the underlying legal and economic frameworks is helpful for all involved parties. The exchange of experiences can also contribute to the avoidance of disappointments and setbacks that could jeopardise the privatisation policy introduced. Relating to the above the Government of India noticed: "Thus, while one would do well to learn from the successful experience, one would have to be careful of the pitfalls as well. In the final analysis, while experience of other countries is available by the way of guidance, one would have to evolve one's own techniques, best suited to the level of development of the country. [...] . The historic, cultural and institutional context influences the way in which and the pace at which privatisation is implemented" (Ministry of Disinvestment 2003, p. 1). Experience sharing between experts of different countries is an appropriate way of learning from each other and avoiding the disadvantages of blue prints at the same time. On initiative of the Ministers of Finance of the Republic of India and the Federal Republic of Germany, both governments agreed, therefore, to enhance the exchange of experiences about disinvestment/privatisation in the framework of economic cooperation. The Ministry of Disinvestment (since June 2004 : Department of Disinvestment in the Ministry of Finance) and the Bundesministerium fuer wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung, BMZ, (Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development) are the responsible authorities. The German contributions will be provided by the Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Technische Zusammenarbeit, GTZ, (German Agency for Technical Cooperation) on behalf of BMZ. This Report gives an overview of selected principles, elements and experiences of privatisation in Germany, with special reference to the new Federal States in East Germany and under consideration of selected aspects in neighbouring countries. The intention is not to present a complete abstract, but to provide a discussion basis for identifying starting points for a future dialogue about lessons learnt. This paper was elaborated by the Hamburg Institute of International Economics (HWWA) at the instigation of Sanjeev S. Ahluwalia, IAS, (Department of Disinvestment) and Dr. Dietrich Kebschull (GTZ).

40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to analyse mutual relations between the European Union and the Caribbean region, especially to study and subsequently evaluate the various levels in which these relations take place. The first chapter deals with the mutual relations of the EU and the Caribbean {{as a part of}} the ACP group of states, which represented the beginnings of their collaboration. In addition to the characteristics of the group as a whole and their common features, it addresses also specific features of different regions while trying to distinguish the Caribbean from the other two. Its main part is a legal institutional form of their relations as well as its practical form. The second chapter is the level at which the EU cooperates with the various groupings of the Caribbean. It discusses the legal institutional framework ensuring their relations, trade and development cooperation.

40|$|This great opus by {{the late}} Andreas Blank is a {{masterpiece}} <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> the depth <b>of</b> its theoretical foundations and its host of concrete examples. These are also listed separately in the word index (Wortregister, pp. 479 – 496), amounting to about 1500 single items in more than ten different languages. Given its unique character as a rich quarry, it is regrettable that the book only exists in German and is not (yet) available in English. Producing an English translation would indeed be a real, tangible homage to the great talents of this marvellous scholar who died far too young. In this review I will mainly concentrate on Blank’s theoretical foundations. Coming from a semantic-structuralist background, Blank has managed – unlike other Romance historical linguists such as Coseriu (see Coseriu 2000) – to adopt an open attitude towards the new theoretical prospects opened up by congnitive linguistics, towards which he was gradually developing, as appears from his edited volume (Blank and Koch 1999). In Prinzipien, he is still wavering between some basic tenets of Saussurean structuralism and the full consequences of the cognitive paradigm change. This is manifested most clearly in his belief in a fundamental split between linguistic meaning and encyclopedic informa-tion.

The ancient collection includes the most important editions of gastronomy that were published in Italy between the sixteenth and the seventeenth century. A peculiar example is De honesta voluptate by Platina (1530), which is considered as the first treatise of modern gastronomy.As regards the works about enology, the library keeps some editions of De naturali vinorum historia (1596) by the Roman doctor Andrea Bacci.The physical-philological-historic-medical-chemical treatise Ampelographia (1660) by the German doctor Philipp Jacob Sachs starts the collection of treatises about ampelography which make the library an international reference point in the field. The dithyrambic literature and poetry {{is an important part}} of the initial collection. The library holds 63 of the 82 known editions of Il Bacco in Toscana by Francesco Redi.Other collections, in addition to the original collection, have increased the patrimony of the library <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> new purchases, <b>both</b> <b>of</b> ancient and modern volumes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a printed organic complementary technology on flexible plastic substrate with high performance N and P-type Organic Thin Film Transistors (OTFTs), based on small-molecule organic semiconductors in solution. Challenges related <b>to</b> the integration <b>of</b> <b>both</b> OTFT types {{in a common}} complementary flow are addressed, showing the importance of surface treatments. Stability on single devices and on an elementary complementary digital circuit (ring oscillator) is studied, demonstrating that a robust and reliable flow with high electrical performances can be established for printed organic devices. These devices are used to manufacture several analog and digital building blocks. The design is carried out using a model specifically developed for this technology, and {{taking into account the}} parametric variability. High-frequency measurements of printed envelope detectors show improved speed performance, resulting from the high mobility of the OTFTs. In addition, a compact dynamic flip–flop and a low-offset comparator are demonstrated, <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> availability <b>of</b> <b>both</b> n-type and p-type OTFTs in the technology. Measurement results are in good agreement with the simulations. The circuits presented establish a complete library of building blocks for the realization of a printed RFID tag...|$|R
30|$|In {{this study}} acetic acid was {{selected}} as a prime suspect model pollutant from {{the wide variety of}} pollutants found typically in the air <b>of</b> repositories, based <b>both</b> on its chemical reactivity and its abundance. The majority of the gaseous pollutants to which paper collections are exposed are considered essentially inert. Only a handful of gaseous substances are described in conservation literature to induce chemical reactions in paper [14]. These pollutants can be subdivided into outdoor generated and indoor generated gases. The effect of the outdoor generated pollutants sulfur-dioxide, nitrogen-oxides and ozone on paper has been studied extensively with accelerated aging laboratory experiments [1 – 3, 5, 6, 24 – 27]. Nevertheless, <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> policies <b>of</b> outdoor pollution reduction and policies of improvement of the energy efficiency of buildings by reducing the fresh air intake, the typical concentration of such gases in repositories has declined below 5  ppb for sulphur dioxide and ozone and 15  ppb for nitrogen dioxide [28]. Probably as a consequence the focus of conservation research shifted in the last 15  years to investigate the indoor generated pollutants methanal (formaldehyde), ethanoic (acetic) and methanoic (formic) acid [4, 7 – 11, 16, 29 – 36]. Indoor emission of formaldehyde from urea–formaldehyde bonded products like fiberboard has been studied thoroughly in connection to human health. The relevance to paper decay is probably small because chemical reactivity is limited in absence of oxidants [9, 37, 38] and concentrations found in archival storage rooms are below 10  ppb [16]. In contrast to the pollutants discussed above, the two carboxylic acids formic and acetic acid are typically found in storage rooms containing paper at concentration levels up to respectively 70  ppb and 150  ppb [14, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22]. In some special situations containing non-paper emitting sources in closed cabinets, higher concentration levels have been reported [39, 40]. Both acids are generated by oxidative and hydrolytic reactions in organic materials like wood and paper [41 – 43]. If absorbed by less acidic paper materials they might promote chemical decay by catalyzing hydrolysis of cellulose. The transfer of chemically reactive volatile components from certain collection objects to others is commonly referred to as cross-contamination. The laboratory-derived experimental evidences of the detrimental effect of acetic acid in typical archival conditions is nevertheless contradictory. Menart and co-authors [10] extrapolating data collected at an intermediate concentration (1000  ppb) and temperature (60, 70 and 80  °C) in a set-up with continuous gas flushing, which guarantees the attainment of equilibrium between the concentration of the gas in air and in the paper, conclude that “the effect (of acetic acid) in typical archival environments is limited and in some cases insignificant”. On the other side in a modified Oddy test for plastic materials performed at 80  °C and for 14  days, acetic acid has been shown to depolymerize pure cellulose paper [44]. In a similar set-up based on the investigation of the impact of historic storage materials on the carbonyl group content and the weight average molar mass of two types of paper, Becker and co-authors [11] conclude that “the mutual evaluation of formic acid and acetic acid is able to explain increased deterioration despite VOC emissions that are seemingly low at first sight”. Prompted by these contradictory evidences we have searched for indications of acetic acid damage on studies examining directly archival collections.|$|R

40|$|Background. Primary and {{acquired}} resistance to selective Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors {{remains the most}} significant obstacle {{to the success of}} these targeted agents in cancer therapy. The mechanisms of resistance involve the activation of alternative signaling pathways able to bypass EGFR blockade, and Akt activation and VEGF induction have been described in EGFR inhibitor-resistant tumors. Combined inhibition of EGFR and other signaling proteins has become an effective approach to efficiently inhibit compensatory escape pathways, stimulating the search for further determinants of resistance as basis for novel therapeutic strategies. Aim of the study. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the signaling mechanisms operating in human cancers with intrinsic or acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies and responsible for the lack of response to EGFR inhibitors. To this aim, we established human cancer cell lines with various degrees of EGFR expression and sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors and analyzed signal transducers under the control of EGFR-dependent and –independent pathways. Results. Multitargeted inhibitor vandetanib (ZD 6474) inhibited human endothelial cells survival <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> inhibition <b>of</b> <b>both</b> VEGFRs and EGFR signaling pathways. Vandetanib also inhibited the growth and the phosphorylation of Akt and its effector p 70 S 6 kinase in both, wild-type and EGFR inhibitor-resistant human colon, prostate and breast cancer cells. We found that the resistant cell lines exhibit, as common features, VEGFR- 1 /Flt- 1 overexpression, increased secretion of VEGF and placental growth factor (PlGF), and augmented migration capabilities, and that vandetanib is able to antagonize them. Accordingly, a new kinase assay revealed that in addition to VEGFR- 2, RET and EGFR, vandetanib efficiently inhibits also VEGFR- 1; this capability plays a key role in determining its activity on EGFR drugs-resistant tumors. The contribution of VEGFR- 1 to the resistant phenotype was further supported by the demonstration that VEGFR- 1 silencing in resistant cells restored sensitivity to anti-EGFR drugs and impaired migration capabilities, while exogenous VEGFR- 1 overexpression in wild-type cells conferred resistance to these agents. Conclusions. This study demonstrates that VEGFR- 1 contributes to anti-EGFR drugs resistance in different human cancer models. Moreover, vandetanib inhibits VEGFR- 1 activation, cell proliferation and migration, suggesting its potential utility in patients resistant to EGFR inhibitors. Since vandetanib is successfully under investigation in several clinical studies, these data may be important for its clinical development...|$|R
