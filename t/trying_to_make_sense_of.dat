500|$|The {{portrayal}} of the Britten family was praised by television critics. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly was keen to Isaacs' acting in the series. [...] "It helps enormously to have Isaacs playing the lead. This actor knows how to convey a gravity that contrasts well with the series' airy concept, but he avoids becoming heavy and morose." [...] West summated that the cast [...] "really couldn't be better on this series"; [...] "Isaacs [...] a stellar performance as the intelligent detective, and loving father and husband who’s just <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> what’s going on and probably not entirely regretful to be experiencing a split reality. Cinema Blend Kelly West claimed that [...] "Laura Allen and Dylan Minnette also deliver strong performances as Michael's wife and son respectively". Critics IGN, TV Fanatic, and the Paste magazine all argued that Jason Isaacs performance deserves an Emmy.|$|E
500|$|Allison Mack characterizes Chloe {{as being}} a [...] "misfit" [...] during the first season; more of [...] "a really smart girl with attitude". She goes on to {{describe}} Chloe as intelligent and independent. Another of Chloe's defining characteristics is her need to [...] "expose falsehoods" [...] and find the truth in every situation. The character is curious, and wants {{to be honest with}} people. She is always <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the situation. Next to her curiosity, her impulsiveness is a key characteristic that eventually leaves her under the control of Lionel Luthor, when she offers to uncover information on Clark for Lionel. The reason for this betrayal is based on Chloe's love for Clark. As Allison Mack explains, Chloe is so blinded by her love for Clark that she neglects to see all of the mistakes that he makes. It is this unrequited love for Clark that [...] "drives [...] to be as ambitious and as focused as she is".|$|E

2500|$|The {{judgment}} briefly {{mentions the}} TRIPS {{agreement and the}} fact that its lack of a list of exclusions from patentability and its requirement that patents should be available in [...] "all fields of technology" [...] puts political pressure on Europe to remove or reduce the categories of non-inventions. However, Jacob had previously ruled that TRIPS does not have direct effect on UK law and thus did not affect the case in question. Instead, cases relating to the exclusions from patentability must be decided by simply <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the language of the EPC without bias for or against exclusion.|$|E
2500|$|The Washington Post said: [...] "is forever {{struggling}} with words and emotions on her debut album The Divine Comedy, forever <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> love {{or the lack}} of it. She never succeeds, of course, but her tenacity is what makes the album worth hearing. Evoking a curious combination of childlike innocence, Harlequin romance and hippie sentimentality, her songs are tone poems of a sort, inspired by vulnerability and wariness, sung in a small, plaintive, unguarded soprano. At times she seems hopelessly lovesick, a prime candidate for any heartbreaker's ruse, but on [...] "You Did It All Before," [...] "Clock," [...] and [...] "Don't Fade Away" [...] she sounds a lot older and wiser, no stranger to hurt and disillusionment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Off Beat {{has been}} {{generally}} well received by readers. It has received praise for its unique style {{of art and}} humour, slow unraveling plot, and {{has been described as}} [...] "a wildly imaginative romantic drama, filled with all the hopes, dreams and anxiety of a teenager <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> his place in the world." [...] Readers find Off Beats setting especially appealing, feeling that Quick has effectively crafted a [...] "pure U.S. city" [...] which has lent itself to a distinct American characterization despite influences from conventional modes of Japanese manga. Conversely, a minority of critics has dismissed these aspects as disorienting when compared to other manga, but nonetheless find redeeming qualities in the story and character development.|$|E

His contributions {{to the theory of}} sensemaking include research papers such as his detailed analysis of the breakdown of sensemaking {{in the case of the}} Mann Gulch disaster, in which he defines the notion of a 'cosmology episode' - a challenge to assumptions that causes participants to question their own capacity to act.|$|R
2500|$|Clark {{recalls that}} Coppola's {{approach}} was {{at odds with}} the subject matter. [...] "Francis... wanted to make it more real. The problem with Finian's Rainbow is that it's sort of like a fairy tale... so <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> it was a very delicate thing." [...] Coppola opted to fall somewhere in the middle, with mixed results. Updating the story line was limited to changing Woody from a labor organizer to the manager of a sharecroppers' cooperative, making college-student Howard a research botanist, and a few minor changes to the lyrics in the Burton Lane-E. Y. Harburg score, such as changing a reference to Carmen Miranda to Zsa Zsa Gabor. Other than that, the plot remains firmly entrenched in an era that predates the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E

60|$|The dinner, {{like all}} other public dinners, was as good and {{substantial}} as a lavish expenditure of cash could make it; but really my recollections of it are very indistinct. The ceaseless din of plates, glasses, knives, forks, and tongues was tremendous; and this, together with the novelty of the scene, {{the heat of the}} room, and excellence of the viands, tended to render me oblivious of much that took place. Almost all the faces present were strange to me. Who were, and who were not, the gentlemen of the committee, was to me matter of the most perfect indifference; and as no one took the trouble to address me in particular, I confined myself to the interesting occupation of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> a conversation held by upwards of fifty pairs of lungs at one and the same time. Nothing intelligible, however, was to be heard, except when a sudden lull in the noise gave a bald-headed old gentleman near {{the head of the table}} an opportunity of drinking the health of a red-faced old gentleman near the foot, upon whom he bestowed an amount of flattery perfectly bewildering; and after making the unfortunate red-faced gentleman writhe for half an hour in a fever of modesty, sat down amid thunders of applause. Whether the applause, by the way, was intended for the speaker or the speakee, I do not know; but being quite indifferent, I clapped my hands with the rest. The red-faced gentleman, now purple with excitement, then rose, and during a solemn silence delivered himself of a speech, to the effect that the day then passing was certainly the happiest in his mortal career, that he could not find words adequately to express the varied feelings which swelled his throbbing bosom, and that he felt quite faint with the mighty load of honour just thrown upon his delighted shoulders by his bald-headed friend. The red-faced gentleman then sat down to the national air of rat-tat-tat, played in full chorus with knives, forks, spoons, nut-crackers, and knuckles on the polished surface of the mahogany table.|$|E
