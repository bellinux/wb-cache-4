25|$|There {{have been}} several episodes in which {{large numbers of people}} were {{severely}} poisoned by food contaminated with high levels of methylmercury, notably the dumping of industrial waste that resulted in the pollution and subsequent mass poisoning in Minamata and Niigata, Japan and <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> in the 1960s and 1970s in which wheat treated with methylmercury as a preservative and intended as seed grain was fed to animals and directly consumed by people (see Basra poison grain disaster). These episodes resulted in neurological symptoms including paresthesias, loss of physical coordination, difficulty in speech, narrowing of the visual field, hearing impairment, blindness, and death. Children who had been exposed in-utero through their mothers' ingestion were also affected with a range of symptoms including motor difficulties, sensory problems and intellectual disability.|$|E

500|$|More than 20 nations (most {{notably the}} United Kingdom), {{designated}} the [...] "coalition of the willing" [...] joined the United States in invading Iraq. They launched the invasion on March 20, 2003. The Iraqi military was quickly defeated. The capital, Baghdad, fell on April 9, 2003. On May 1, Bush declared {{the end of}} major combat operations in Iraq. The initial success of U.S. operations increased his popularity, but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; Bush's [...] "Mission Accomplished" [...] speech was later criticized as premature. From 2004 until 2007, <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> deteriorated further, with some observers arguing {{that there was a}} full-scale civil war in Iraq. Bush's policies met with criticism, including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq. The 2006 report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, led by James Baker, concluded that <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> was [...] "grave and deteriorating". While Bush admitted that there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of Iraq, he maintained he would not change the overall Iraq strategy. According to Iraq Body Count, some 251,000 Iraqis {{have been killed in the}} civil war following the U.S.-led invasion, including at least 163,841 civilians.|$|E

500|$|Clinton {{opposed the}} Iraq War troop surge of 2007, for both {{military}} and domestic political reasons (by the following year, she was privately acknowledging that the surge had been successful). In March of that year, she {{voted in favor}} of a war-spending bill that required President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq by a deadline; it passed almost completely along party lines but was subsequently vetoed by Bush. In May, a compromise war funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80–14 and would be signed by Bush; Clinton {{was one of those who}} voted against it. Clinton responded to General David Petraeus's September 2007 Report to Congress on <b>the</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> by saying, [...] "I think that the reports that you provide to us really require a willing suspension of disbelief." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2006, George W.

Bush replied [...] "It's bad in Iraq. Does that help?". He had another run-in with Bush at a press conference at Camp David, when Bush asked him [...] "you still hanging around?". He then suggested to Robinson, with reference {{to the fact that it}} was a hot day, that [...] "next time you should cover your bald head". As Bush walked away, Robinson replied [...] "I didn't know you cared", to which Bush responded [...] "I don't". Robinson described his quip as a [...] "fatal error" [...] on his blog. In a final encounter in 2008, Bush joked with Robinson about still not wearing his hat.|$|E
500|$|Thompson began May at {{the first}} Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California {{sponsored}} by MSNBC on May 3. During the debate, he again voiced his support for an Iraqi vote, and included the plan's second phase if the Iraqis chose for American forces {{to remain in the}} nation. He stated that the oil revenues could have been split and a system of federalism could have been established. When asked about abortion, Thompson stated that he believed its legalization should be left up to the individual states, disagreeing with the precedent set in Roe v. Wade. He was also given the opportunity to discuss his governorship of Wisconsin, highlighting his record of 1,900 vetoes and the overall cutting of taxes by $16.4 billion. On the subject of taxes, he articulated his support for the option of a flat tax for the taxpayer, if it was to their benefit. At the end of the debate, Thompson differentiated himself from President George W. Bush stating that as president he would [...] "transform the health care system" [...] and settle <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b>|$|E

500|$|On May 18, Gilmore {{appeared}} on the MSNBC program Tucker, hosted by Tucker Carlson.

He stated that it {{is in the interest of}} Americans to remain in Iraq and be involved in the [...] "Middle East issue" [...] because if not, America is [...] "going to end up with a major war". Later in the interview when Gilmore was asked if he believed Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was credible, he stated, [...] "No, I don’t think he is particularly credible". On May 27, Gilmore {{appeared on}} ABC's This Week and continued the strategy of attacking his opponents in the race for president. On the show, he criticized the credentials of former Senator and potential candidate Fred Thompson of Tennessee. He reminded the audience that Thompson is [...] "a one-term senator" [...] and that [...] "he's well known because of his Law & Order appearance. But the question is, is there a solid, consistent record there of supporting conservative principles?" ...|$|E
500|$|Early in May, Dodd {{continued}} to campaign in California {{for a few}} days but later shifted back to the strategically important states of Iowa and New Hampshire {{for the rest of the}} month. On May 15 the campaign released its first ad, which detailed his plan for ending the war in Iraq. In the ad, Dodd also criticized his fellow Democratic candidates by stating, [...] "We can't simply wait for a new president. We should have the conviction to stand up to this one," [...] In Washington, Dodd was exposed to debate on the Iraq War Spending Bill and new videos from al-Qaeda's second in command Ayman al-Zawahiri. Back on the campaign trail he talked about how he would deal with foreign issues particularly in regards to <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> [...] "I'm not going to let my foreign policy be decided by Mr. al-Zawahiri. Obviously, he's playing his game here. He'd probably like to see us stay down there, bogged down, at the costs we're increasing here, the loss of lives, not to mention the isolation of the United States." [...] When Presidential candidate John Edwards released an ad criticizing Congress' failure to end the Iraq War, Dodd took it personal and shot back at Edwards stating, [...] ""With all due respect, we could have used John's vote here in the Senate on these issues here."

500|$|The summit was {{dominated}} by divisions over the Iraq war as NATO members were only able to agree to limited assistance {{in the form of}} training for Iraqi security forces. The NATO support given to Iraq troop training was in response to a request by the Iraqi Interim Government, and in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546, which requests international and regional organisations to contribute assistance to the multinational force. Even this limited agreement contained areas of contention, with France insisting that it would only help with training outside Iraq, while the United States favored that the training would take place inside Iraq. As a consequence, the deal was left deliberately vague and differences remained on whether NATO should train Iraqi officers inside Iraq, or limit itself to training outside the country and acting as a clearing house for national efforts. The commitment was also vague as it was not made clear what the size of the training mission would be or exactly when and where it would take place. German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, known for his earlier opposition to the Iraq War, commented: [...] "The engagement of NATO is reduced to training and only training. We have made clear that we don't want to see German soldiers in Iraq." [...] Despite outwardly optimistic statements by the US concerning NATO's commitment towards Iraqi troop training after the summit, France and Germany had refused to share the burden of responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> and did not support the US and British demand for sending NATO troops. Put differently, participation in the multinational forces in Iraq was left to the discretion of the particular alliance members and the USA relunctantly consented to troop training outside Iraq. Consequently, despite an outward show of NATO unity, the split over Iraq still persisted and tensions in interstate relations within the alliance were not resolved.|$|E
