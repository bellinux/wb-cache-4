40|$|Replication, transcription, and {{translation}} stress all lead <b>to</b> <b>stalling</b> {{of their}} respective polymerases (DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase, and the ribosome), and the cell must respond to these events {{in order to preserve}} macromolecular integrity. In response to replication stress such as DNA damage, the cell activates a checkpoint and promotes repair or bypass at the lesion. Transcriptional stress leading <b>to</b> <b>stalling</b> of RNA polymerase can also be caused by DNA damage, and recognizing stalled RNA polymerase can lead to transcription-coupled repair or, in response <b>to</b> prolonged <b>stalling,</b> degradation of the polymerase. Translational stress generated by problems either with the mRNA template or the ribosome itself also leads <b>to</b> <b>stalling</b> of the ribosome, and the cell responds by degrading both the message and the nascent polypeptide. In this review, we will discuss the stresses that lead <b>to</b> <b>stalling</b> of each of the polymerases and how the cell recognizes and responds <b>to</b> the <b>stalled</b> enzymes...|$|R

5|$|Actual {{planning}} for I-359 commenced in 1961, and by 1971, the Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) announced that federal funding would be sought for its construction. Planning for the corridor continued throughout the 1970s, only <b>to</b> <b>stall</b> briefly due to complications with the required {{environmental impact assessment}} associated with the project. By 1976, it was announced I-359 would have an exit both at 35th Street and 15th Street to improve access to both the University of Alabama and Stillman College.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the wing was its washout. The {{trailing}} edge of the wing twisted slightly upward along its span, the angle of incidence decreasing from +2° at its root to -½° at its tip. This caused the wing roots <b>to</b> <b>stall</b> before the tips, reducing tip-stall that could otherwise {{have resulted in a}} wing drop, often leading to a spin. As the wing roots started <b>to</b> <b>stall,</b> the separating air stream started to buffet (vibrate) the aircraft, warning the pilot, and hence allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly the aircraft to the limits of its performance. This washout was first featured in the wing of the Type 224 and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire. The complexity of the wing design, especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading-edge structures, at first caused some major hold-ups in the production of the Spitfire. The problems increased when the work was put out to subcontractors, most of whom had never dealt with metal-structured, high-speed aircraft. By June 1939, most of these problems had been resolved, and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings.|$|E

40|$|The family B DNA {{polymerase}} {{from the}} euryarchaeote, Pyrococcus furiosus (PFU-Pol), {{has been shown}} to recognize template strand uracil and stall DNA synthesis four bases ahead, thus preventing the permanent fixation of the mutation. This recognition is due to the presence of a special pocket in the N-terminal domain of the enzyme. This study confirmed the recognition of hypoxanthine, the deaminated product of adenine, by PFU-Pol. Primer extension assays demonstrated that template strand hypoxanthine leads <b>to</b> <b>stalling</b> of DNA synthesis, four bases demonstrated that template strand hypoxanthine leads <b>to</b> <b>stalling</b> of DNA synthesis, four bases in front of the base, exactly the same position as seen for uracil.

40|$|RFWD 3 has E 3 ligase {{activity}} in vitro, but its in vivo function remains unknown. In {{this study we}} identified RFWD 3 as a novel replication protein A (RPA) -associated protein. Using purified proteins, we observed a direct interaction between RPA 2 and RFWD 3. Further analysis showed that RFWD 3 is recruited <b>to</b> <b>stalled</b> replication forks and co-localizes with RPA 2 in response to replication stress. Moreover, RFWD 3 is important for ATR-dependent Chk 1 activation in response to replication stress. Upon replication stress, deletion of RPA 2 binding region on RFWD 3 impairs its localization <b>to</b> <b>stalled</b> replication forks and decreases Chk 1 activation. Taken together, our results suggest that RFWD 3 and RPA 2 functionally interact and participate in replication checkpoint control...|$|R

5|$|Gibraltar's {{relationship}} with Spain {{continued to be}} a sensitive subject. By 2002, Britain and Spain had proposed an agreement to share sovereignty over Gibraltar. However, it was opposed by the government of Gibraltar, which put it to a referendum in November 2002. The agreement was rejected by 17,000 votes to 187– a majority of 98.97%. Although both governments dismissed the outcome as having no legal weight, the outcome of the referendum caused the talks <b>to</b> <b>stall</b> and the British government accepted that it would be unrealistic to try to reach an agreement without the support of the people of Gibraltar.|$|E

40|$|DNA {{damage and}} {{secondary}} structures {{can act as}} potent obstacles to the replication machinery. Persistent <b>stalling</b> events lead <b>to</b> genomic instability and therefore numerous cellular tolerance mechanisms exist to complete genome duplication {{in the presence of}} such impediments. In addition to translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases, eukaryotic cells contain a multi-functional replicative enzyme called Primase-Polymerase (PrimPol) that is capable of directly bypassing DNA damage by TLS, as well as repriming replication restart downstream of lesions and secondary structures. Here, we report that PrimPol is recruited <b>to</b> re-prime <b>stalled</b> replication through its interaction with RPA. Using crystallographic and biophysical approaches, we identify that PrimPol possesses two RPA-interacting motifs and identify the key residues required for these interactions. We demonstrate that one of these motifs is critical for PrimPol’s recruitment <b>to</b> <b>stalled</b> replication forks in vivo thus facilitating its role in re-priming DNA synthesis. In addition, biochemical analysis reveals that RPA serves to stimulate the primase activity of PrimPol. Together, these findings provide unprecedented molecular insights into PrimPol’s mode of recruitment <b>to</b> <b>stalled</b> forks that enables it to efficiently re-prime the restart of DNA replication...|$|R
