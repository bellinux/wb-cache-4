5|$|At {{the end of}} the Cold War, the FPÖ {{became more}} eurosceptic, which was {{reflected}} by its change from pan-Germanism to Austrian patriotism. The party's opposition to the European Union grew stronger in the 1990s. The FPÖ opposed Austria's joining the EU in 1994, and promoted a popular initiative against the replacement of the Austrian Schilling with the Euro in 1998, but to no avail. Owing <b>to</b> <b>perceived</b> differences between Turkish and European culture, the party opposes the accession of Turkey to the EU; it has declared that should this happen, Austria must immediately leave the EU.|$|E
5|$|Newspaper writers {{initially}} performed {{this function}} {{in the early days}} of Major League Baseball (MLB). As the importance of baseball player statistics increased, teams began to pressure writer-scorers for favorable scoring decisions for their players in games played at home stadiums, and a home team scoring bias was perceived by many coaches, players, and writers. Controversies related <b>to</b> <b>perceived</b> bias or errors in scoring have led to questions about important baseball records, including several no-hitters and Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak of 1941. By 1979, many major newspapers decided to ban their writers from scoring baseball games due to conflict-of-interest concerns, and in 1980 MLB began to hire independent official scorers.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} and {{defends the}} capacity view, that is, {{the view that}} the ability <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> the perspective-independent or intrinsic properties of objects depends on the perceiver’s capacity to act. More specifically, I argue that self-location and spatial know-how are jointly necessary <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> the intrinsic spatial properties of objects. Representing one’s location allows one to abstract from one’s particular vantage point <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> the perspective-independent properties of objects. Spatial know-how allows one <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> objects as {{the kind of things that}} are perceivable from points of view other than one’s own and thus <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> them as three-dimensional space occupiers...|$|R

5|$|The {{first version}} of the Gorgon, Medusa, was to have five feet, but due <b>to</b> <b>perceived</b> {{animation}} difficulties, the final version had one tail. Other Gorgons in the game adhered to this design. The goddess Artemis was considered for inclusion in God of War: Ascension as a playable female character, offering alternative combat options. Game Director Todd Papy said {{she would have been}} depicted as half-human and half-feline, with the head and torso of a woman and the legs of a lioness. However, she was ultimately cut from the game and thus only appears in the original God of War as a translucent head.|$|E
5|$|BK targets {{specific}} sub-groups {{within the}} adult market. Products like the BK Stacker and BK XXL {{are aimed at}} late teen to young adult males; health-conscious individuals are offered products such as salads, grilled chicken, and veggie burgers. Products such as the BK Veggie, a meatless burger initially introduced in 2002, target the female and health-oriented demographic using a co-branded marketing program and a patty produced by the Kellogg Company's Morningstar Farms division. Another sub-market in this group is on-the-go parents and commuters; The company's BK Chicken Fries—French-fry cut pieces of breaded chicken—is specifically targeted to this segment. First introduced in 2005, the product was successful enough that Burger King expanded the marketing of chicken fries to the children's demographic with a kid's meal version of the product in 2007. The meal was launched with a cross-promotion in conjunction with Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants. The series of commercials raised the ire of the American Family Association due <b>to</b> <b>perceived</b> nudity concerns.|$|E
5|$|In 1847, in {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>perceived</b> discrimination against First Nations {{people by the}} Hudson's Bay Company in the fur trade, Belcourt prepared a petition to Queen Victoria to seek redress. The petition was signed by 977 First Nations people, but the Colonial Secretary, Earl Grey, consulted with advisors who had little sympathy for the natives and took no action in the case. The Company criticised Belcourt for what it saw as his inciting discontent among the local First Nations. The Company administrators decided that the priest {{should not be allowed}} to remain in British North America. The missionary was arrested, but was released after the charges against him were discovered to be unfounded. At the urging of the Company's Governor, the Archbishop of Quebec asked Belcourt to return to Montreal. Belcourt asked the Governor of the Company to retract the charges for which he was arrested. The Governor apologised for what he described as a mistake on the part of the Company's chief Factors.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} 500 economically disadvantaged females' perceptions and screening practices regarding breast cancer. The {{vast majority of}} respondents did not identify themselves, or economically disadvantaged women in general, as more susceptible to breast cancer. Those who were the most knowledgeable about breast cancer {{were significantly more likely}} than the least knowledgeable <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> themselves as more susceptible to breast cancer, <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> breast cancer as less severe, <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> fewer barriers, and <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> more benefits <b>to</b> screening for breast cancer. Fifty-four percent of the women claimed they had previously had a mammogram. A series of t-tests were conducted to see if breast cancer knowledge or health beliefs would discriminate between those who had and those who had not had a mammogram. The only {{difference between the two groups}} was that those who had a mammogram were more likely <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> greater benefits of mammography screening. The results of this survey indicate that there is considerable room for improvement in knowledge, perceptions, and practices of economically disadvantaged women regarding breast cancer...|$|R

50|$|Bilingual {{speakers}} {{often find}} themselves in situations where a pair of phonemes are contrasted {{in one of their}} languages but not in the other. Babies are born with the ability to discriminate all phonemes, but as they age their ability <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> phoneme boundaries lessens in ways specifically tailored to the language they hear as their input. In order <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> a particular phonemic contrast, then, the pair must be contrastive in one's input. Generally, the earlier a language and/or phonemic contrast is learned, or is part of the input, the more sensitive a listener is to the phonemic boundaries of that pair and therefore better able <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> the difference between the contrasting sounds. It is still possible, though, for late learners to acquire the ability <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> contrasts that are not part of their first language.|$|R
