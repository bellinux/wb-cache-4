25|$|The {{choice of}} {{discount}} rate is subjective. A smaller rate values future generations equally {{with the current}} generation. Larger rates (e.g. a market rate of return) reflects humans' attraction to time inconsistency—valuing money that they receive today more than money <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. The choice makes a large difference in assessing interventions with long-term effects. One issue is the equity premium puzzle, in which long-term returns on equities may be rather higher than they should be. If so then arguably market rates of return {{should not be used}} to determine a discount rate, as doing so would have the effect of undervaluing the distant future (e.g. climate change).|$|E

And how do you sum up what will one day be viewed as one of the most significant moments in the history of college football? I’m not exaggerating....Boise State beating Oklahoma in a New Year’s Day bowl game is college football’s equivalent to George Mason reaching the Final Four, with one extremely significant difference: George Mason had its chance to compete for the national title; Boise State does not. Like it or not, Boise State 43, Oklahoma 42 just became the single biggest argument to date for a college football playoff....Not only did <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, they made a major statement on behalf of their mid-major brethren that none of us will soon forget.|$|E

While there, he {{was offered}} the role of father Danny Brogan in Cape Wrath, an Ecosse Films series about a family being moved on a witness {{protection}} scheme to a mysterious village. He {{signed on to the}} seven-part series in September 2006 and filmed the series {{until the end of the}} year. He relished working on the character's back story as it confounded the expectations of both him and the audience. The series was broadcast in Britain and America in 2007. The following year, he played the part of Colonel Brandon in Andrew Davies' serial Sense and Sensibility. When he first got the script in 2007, he was unsure if British television needed another Jane Austen adaptation, but he took the role when he saw how Davies had given more screen time to the male characters than <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1995 film adaptation. He also appeared as Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk in The Other Boleyn Girl (2008). He compared Norfolk to bassist Lemmy from Motörhead and researched the role by reading history books and literature from the 16th century.|$|E

2500|$|The review commented {{negatively}} {{on some of}} {{the scenes}} involving Nancy's family, noting that [...] "the movie's worst scenes involve Nancy and her alcoholic mother". On the character development, Newman stated that [...] "the impression that about two hundred pages worth of characterisation has been compressed into cliché details like boozy Ronee Blakley demonstrating her renewed self-respect by throwing away a half-full bottle." [...] Newman also said that the nightmares in the film worked against itself, stating that [...] "while the kissing telephone and bottomless bathtub are disorienting in the [...] Cronenberg spirit, <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of the relentless, pursuing-monster aspect that Carpenter manages so well." ...|$|E

Though he expresses that he saw little need for Mickey and Jackie in this episode, he asserts that Donna had [...] "the saddest end for a companion ever" [...] and praises Davies for just managing to keep the plot together. He argues that as Davies [...] "writes the emotions and big themes so well...blow logic and rational plot moments if <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way!" [...] He compares Davies's writing style to [...] "PT Barnum showmanship" [...] and praises both the dark and light elements of the episode. He concludes that, if not overthought, the episode remains [...] "an audacious, big, silly, often poignant season finale".|$|E
2500|$|In late August, Harris lost {{another key}} staffer, Rhyan Metzler, {{in the wake}} of a {{disastrous}} political rally at Orlando Executive Airport. Only 40 people showed up for the event, and Harris blamed the paltry turnout in part on a last-minute change in location. She claimed that a tree fell on the hangar that was originally scheduled to hold the rally, forcing her campaign to switch to another hangar. Airport officials, however, stated that not only had no trees fallen, but also that there are no trees as <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of the airplanes; further adding that the event in fact took place in the hangar that Harris's campaign had originally booked. Harris's campaign blamed Metzler for the comments Harris made after the rally. On August 31, 2006, Harris was interviewed on Hardball with Chris Matthews, where she responded to the criticisms from her former staffers with [...] "We have their email traffic, we know what was behind all that, we know who's been paid and who isn't." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the USA, the {{negative}} usage {{appears to have}} continued into the 1930s. F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1922 novel The Beautiful and Damned uses the word twice: [...] "It {{was one of the}} type known as 'tourist' cars, a sort of brummagem Pullman ... a single patch of vivid green trees that guaranteed the brummagem umbrageousness of Riverside Drive". Gilbert Seldes, in his 1924 book The Seven Lively Arts, wrote in praise of Krazy Kat: [...] "everything paste and brummagem has had its vogue with us; and a genuine, honest native product has gone unnoticed". It appears in two essays by H.L. Mencken from 1926: [...] "Valentino" [...] ("Consider the sordid comedy of his two marriages – the brummagem, star-spangled passion that invaded his very deathbed!") and [...] "A Glance Ahead" [...] ("It would be hard to find a country in which such brummagem serene highnesses are revered with more passionate devotion than <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States.") Mencken's influence is apparent when the term appears in John Fante's 1939 novel Ask the Dust: [...] "The church must go, it is the haven of the booboisie, of boobs and bounders and all brummagem mountebanks." [...] More recently, Lemony Snicket, in his 1999 young adult novel The Reptile Room, introduces brummagem as a rare synonym for [...] "fake".|$|E
