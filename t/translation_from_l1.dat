5000|$|The {{distinctive}} feature of DLT {{was the use}} of version of Esperanto as an intermediate language (IL) and the idea that translation could be divided into two stages: <b>from</b> <b>L1</b> into IL and then from IL into L2. The intermediate translation could be transmitted over a network to any number of workstations which would take care of the <b>translation</b> <b>from</b> IL into the desired language. Since the IL format would have been disambiguated at the source, it could itself serve as a source for further translation without human intervention.
