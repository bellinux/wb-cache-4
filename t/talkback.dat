5|$|On 10 September 2007, Licciardello rang a <b>talkback</b> {{radio station}} {{pretending to be}} someone else, and complained about the stunt, {{claiming}} that it was stupid and anyone involved at the ABC, including Kerry O'Brien, should be jailed for ten years. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode, and Licciardello said {{he wished he had}} made the call on the evening of the security breach because <b>talkback</b> radio discussion would not have already died down.|$|E
5|$|However, the ABC {{received}} more than 250complaints, outweighing the 177 positive submissions. A spokesperson for the national broadcaster said that the results were misleading because people who enjoyed the show typically do not make comments. Around the country, around 80% of callers to <b>talkback</b> radio were supportive; and one third of all calls regarding APEC mentioned the stunt.|$|E
5|$|Although {{set in a}} hospital, it uses {{no medical}} storylines; the action is {{produced}} {{by a series of}} soap opera-style twists and turns in the personal lives of the characters. They proceed through a series of often absurd sketch-like scenes, or by sequences where the film is slowed down or sped up, often emphasizing the body language of the characters. The show had eight writers. Two series were made by the <b>Talkback</b> Thames production company for Channel 4.|$|E

50|$|The {{result is}} a coming of age tale {{disguised}} within the indie genre. Because of its comedy-drama blend, it has been compared at <b>talkbacks</b> and forums at film festivals to films by Woody Allen, Wes Anderson, Todd Solondz and Richard Linklater.|$|R

5|$|The tour {{started on}} May 23 in Lethbridge {{and went on}} to the other Canadian cities of Saskatoon, Ottawa, Montreal, Halifax, London, Winnipeg, Calgary, Victoria, Vancouver, Kelowna, Edmonton, and Red Deer. London was added mid-tour because of popular demand. The London {{performances}} were hosted by Men Against Sexual Trafficking and the London Anti-Human Trafficking Committee.

5|$|After {{making his}} debut as Hughie Grant in the Oxford-financed Privileged (1982), Grant dabbled {{in a variety}} of jobs, such as working as an {{assistant}} groundsman at Fulham Football Club, tutoring, writing comedy sketches for TV shows, and working for <b>Talkback</b> Productions to write and produce radio commercials for products such as Mighty White bread and Red Stripe lager. To obtain his Equity card, he joined the Nottingham Playhouse, a regional theatre, and lived for a year at Park Terrace in The Park Estate. Bored with small acting parts, he created his own comedy revue called The Jockeys of Norfolk, a name taken from Shakespeare's Richard III, with friends Chris Lang and Andy Taylor. The group toured London's pub comedy circuit with stops at The George IV in Chiswick, Canal Cafe Theatre in Little Venice and The King's Head in Islington. Starting on a low note, The Jockeys of Norfolk eventually proved a hit at the Edinburgh Festival after their sketch on the Nativity, told as an Ealing comedy, gained them a spot on the BBC2 TV show called Edinburgh Nights. During this time, Grant also appeared in theatre productions of plays such as An Inspector Calls (at the Royal Exchange, Manchester), Lady Windermere's Fan, and Coriolanus.|$|E

40|$|The article {{examines}} the place of national narratives and metanarratives in reconciliation between parties to an identity conflict and the role the media play in this process. The article introduces a conceptual framework demonstrating the relationship between metanarrative and national narratives and applies it {{to the case of}} Mohammad al-Dura in September 2000. It analyses items from two Israeli newspapers (Yediot Aharonot and Ha’aretz) and three Palestinian newspapers (al-Quds, Alayam, and al-Hayat al-Jadida) as well as news reports published online by two Israeli portals, YNET and WALLA!, and the <b>talkbacks</b> received in response to the coverage. The analysis illustrates the role the media, and more specifically Palestinian regular media and the Israeli <b>talkbacks,</b> have played in amplifying the national narratives and reinforcing the colliding metanarratives. On the other hand, the Israeli media have, by and large, proved the article’s thesis that narratives in an identity conflict can be handled differently. By deconstructing the narrative to its constitutive components, raising questions regarding the reliability of one’s own national/official version, and showing readiness to incorporate the narrative of the “other ” into one’s own narrative, the media have played a potentially positive role in the reconciliation process between Israelis and Palestinians...|$|R
