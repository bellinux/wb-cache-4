5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the mating season, adult females move from <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term ‘harems’ that consist of a male and an unstable group of up to five females.

The mating system of the grey-headed flying fox is best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential resources to females and are chosen {{on the basis of their}} physical location within the roost, which correlates with male quality.|$|E

40|$|The paper explores <b>the</b> <b>peripheries</b> of <b>the</b> city of Napoli {{starting}} {{from a different}} definition and description of its huge public housing stock. The main research hypothesis is that public housing transformations, their historical evolution and differences, are very important elements for the city regeneration politics design, that {{should be able to}} deal with the complexity and variety of the present problems (first of all social exclusion). The limited effectiveness of peripheries politics is often tied to an erroneously homogenous reading of <b>the</b> <b>peripheries</b> as if they were an homogeneous thing. For this reason the paper proposes a description of <b>the</b> Napoli’s <b>peripheries</b> based on their public housing dimension, that it is important to redefine the different characteristics, invariants and problems of this parts of the city. Through this process of re-descriptions of <b>the</b> different <b>peripheries,</b> with theirs ‘evils’ (or values), we recognize background’s emergencies and problems that supply indications for the treatment of important problematic dimensions as policy design proposals for <b>the</b> <b>peripheries</b> public politics...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} I investigate, what I have called ‘the paradox of {{urbanization}}’, through {{the case of}} Rio de Janeiro. The paradox of urbanization is {{a process in which}} the qualitative impulses - improvements of urbanization, such as public infrastructure and facilities - are planned and implemented in central neighborhoods, while the quantitative rate of urbanization - the strongest growth of the city in terms of residents - takes place in <b>the</b> <b>peripheries</b> of <b>the</b> city. In Rio de Janeiro the paradox of urbanization has resulted in a divided city, in which rich and poor neighborhoods are separated, and exist as closed and partially autonomous communities. The prosperous central neighborhoods were facilitated with parks, pavements, and public buildings, while <b>the</b> <b>peripheries</b> were developed with private means: residents paved their own sidewalks, and companies provided collective buildings and facilities. Based on the work of Ananya Roy, I propose a role for architects and planners that I shall indicate as ‘the aesthetization of urbanity’. I propose that architects and planners should create spaces for public functions, with a substantial urban qualitity that transcends the interest of a particular community, and adopt the common norms of society as a standard for their representation. The aesthetization of urbanity is a response to community based, self-help projects: using similar architectural means in the peripheral zones as one would use in the centre, to give <b>the</b> <b>peripheries</b> a qualitative impulse that trancends local interests, and make <b>the</b> <b>peripheries</b> an integral and established part of the city. The qualitative improvements in <b>the</b> <b>peripheries</b> should be of substantial architectural quality as a mean of representation of state interest in <b>the</b> poor <b>peripheries,</b> should be in the interest of society as a whole and not only a local community, and should create opportunities for residents in <b>the</b> <b>peripheries</b> of <b>the</b> city through public means.

40|$|The {{differential}} tissue {{distributions of}} aztreonam and ceftazidime within fibrin clots infected with Pseudo-monas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens, their efficacies, and the in vivo bacterial morphological changes induced by these drugs were evaluated. Rabbits were given intravenously a single dose of 100 mg of either agents/kg of body weight. In the cores of the clots, the peak levels of both drugs were {{much lower than}} those observed in <b>the</b> <b>peripheries</b> and in serum. Aztreonam’s half-lives within <b>the</b> <b>peripheries</b> and in <b>the</b> cores of the fibrin clots were up to six times higher than that observed in serum, while ceftazidime’s half-lives in clots were twice that observed in serum. This resulted in a much greater penetration ratio for aztreonam than for ceftazidime. Both drugs controlled the growth of P. aeruginosa in vivo, but E. cloacae and S. marcescens responded better to ceftazidime. Morphological changes were more abundant in <b>the</b> <b>peripheries</b> than in <b>the</b> cores of the clots. In the control group, P. aeruginosa’s morphology in the cores was different than that in <b>the</b> <b>peripheries</b> of <b>the</b> clots. Against P. aeruginosa, aztreonam did induce morphological changes in the cores while ceftazidime did not. Electron microscopic studies revealed that morphological changes associated with aztreonam seemed different than those of ceftazidime. Along with elongation of bacteria, more bow tie and herniated bacteria were observed with aztreonam.

5|$|Matangi {{is often}} {{described}} as an outcaste and impure. Her association with pollution mainly streams from her relation to outcaste communities, considered to be polluted in Hindu society. These social groups deal in occupations deemed inauspicious and polluted like collection of waste, meat-processing and working in cremation grounds. In a Nepali context, such groups are collectively called Matangi, who collect waste—including human waste—and other inauspicious things, and often live outside villages. Thus she is associated with death, pollution, inauspiciousness and <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> of Hindu society.|$|E

5|$|Surveys have {{revealed}} {{an average of}} 436 structures per square kilometer (1118 per square mile) in the site core, falling to 244 structures/km² (626/square mile) in <b>the</b> <b>periphery.</b> At its height in the Late Preclassic, the population has been estimated at 1600 in the site core with a further 8000 dispersed through <b>the</b> <b>periphery,</b> to produce an estimated total population of almost ten thousand.

In the Late to Terminal Classic the population increased to 85% of its Late Preclassic level, an expansion {{that appears to have}} occurred rapidly and spread to all parts of the site, perhaps as the result of an influx of refugees arriving from other sites around AD 830.
