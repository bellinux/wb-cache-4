500|$|Orville {{apparently}} visualized {{that the}} fixed rudder resisted {{the effect of}} corrective wing-warping when attempting to level off from a turn. He wrote in his diary that {{on the night of}} October 2, [...] "I studied out a new vertical rudder". The brothers then decided <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> rear rudder <b>movable</b> <b>to</b> solve <b>the</b> problem. They hinged the rudder and connected it to the pilot's warping [...] "cradle", so a single movement by the pilot simultaneously controlled wing-warping and rudder deflection. Tests while gliding proved that the trailing edge of the rudder should be turned away from whichever end of the wings had more drag (and lift) due to warping. The opposing pressure produced by turning the rudder enabled corrective wing-warping to reliably restore level flight after a turn or a wind disturbance. Furthermore, when the glider banked into a turn, rudder pressure overcame the effect of differential drag and pointed the nose of the aircraft {{in the direction of the}} turn, eliminating adverse yaw.|$|R

50|$|If {{the linkage}} has four hinged joints with axes angled to {{intersect}} {{in a single}} point, then the links move on concentric spheres and the assembly is called a spherical four-bar linkage.

40|$|Abstract. The slanted-guide-pillar core-pulling {{mechanism}} {{is the most}} commonly used side core-pulling mechanism in die-casting die. But when filling the die with pressure, aluminum leak frequently happens between lower motion-stopping surface of sliding block and side surface of moving die insert, since the clearance is bigger between side core and core hole. In many improved approaches, changing the lower motion-stopping surface of sliding block into upper motion-stopping surface of it or reducing the lower motion-stopping surface area is the simplest and reliable measure. The sliding block’s setback which occurs in die-casting process can be eliminated effectively and the workload of maintaining die can be reduced by this measure. Common structure of Slanted-guide-pillar core-pulling mechanism in die-casting die The die casting is one of main formed methods for aluminum alloy. If there are holes or grooves or convex plates in sidewall of casting part, the corresponding components in die-casting die must be designed <b>the</b> <b>movable</b> cores which can move in side direction[1]. When the casting part need to be taken out from die, <b>the</b> <b>movable</b> cores must be pulled out firstly before die-opening(otherwise, the die can not be opened). When closing the die, it must be returned. Like this mechanism which can <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>movable</b> core pull out and return, usually call it side core-pulling mechanism...|$|R
