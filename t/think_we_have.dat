And I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to take what the secretary Condoleezza Rice says at face value. It is something very important, it is done very carefully and she has said we do not authorise, condone torture in any way, shape or form.|$|E

I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to wait for the estimation of historians'. However, on a TV program in July 2006 he denied that Manchukuo was a puppet state.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{imperfections}} in the new South Africa where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> basically achieved what we set out to achieve. And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E

500|$|Rise Against's musical style {{throughout}} the band's {{career has been}} described by most critics as melodic hardcore, punk rock, and hardcore punk. The band has cited numerous punk and hardcore bands as influences to its music.

Huntsman also supports granting more H-1B visas to foreigners.|$|E

In 1972, she stated, [...] "Anything that gets out of control becomes a hazard, whether it's fire, flood, or women's lib". She {{went on to say}} that [...] "we want to preserve the nobility, dignity, and femininity of women; there's a danger of some of that being lost.

500|$|In 1805, Ordener {{participated in}} the {{campaign}} against Austria as commander of a regiment of horse grenadiers of the Imperial Guard. At the Battle of Austerlitz, he led a decisive and energetic charge. He executed this, upon order of Napoleon, with impetuosity; this was the charge that pushed the Russians onto the ice and during which, French sources maintain, 40,000 Russians drowned and another 30,000 were taken prisoner. Although this charge garnered for Ordener his promotion to general of division, Napoleon commented that Ordener was worn out. He followed this observation with the frequently quoted prediction, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{no more than five}} or six years left of him." ...|$|E

NASCAR vice president for competition Robin Pemberton stated, [...] "We'll have to get back and talk to the teams and look at the speeds from the last two days of testing. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> some high-water marks at 197-and-a-half [...] which, depending on where they pulled up in the draft, it may be a little quick, but it's hard to say." ...|$|E

Povenmire, eating dinner with his family at a Wild Thyme restaurant in South Pasadena, California, drew a quick sketch of a [...] "triangle kid." [...] Povenmire named the triangle doodle [...] "Phineas," [...] saying he [...] "look like [...] ", and with reference to the character Phileas Fogg (often misreferenced as [...] "Phineas Fogg") from Around the World in 80 Days.

Egan said that her mother [...] "told me he was a great character, but an evil one, so I was really excited. And now knowing Michael, it has been so much fun." [...] She said that [...] "everyone seems to <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> good on-screen chemistry" [...] and that [...] "it's an interesting energy between Chelsea and Adam being the [...] "bad guys" [...] in town."

500|$|The Kazon were {{inspired}} by Los Angeles gangs, and were referenced in a [...] "shorthand 'Crips' and 'Bloods' fashion". The idea for the Kazon as warrior sects, {{as opposed to a}} unified race, was introduced by Taylor, who drafted them as [...] "three gangs, with constantly shifting relationships and allegiances. Just as we <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> sorted it out, the balance shifts again." [...] While discussing the Kazon's original inspiration, Taylor viewed them as a way [...] "to address the tenor of our times and what [...] was happening in our cities and recognizing a source of danger and social unrest". Piller further described the premise for the Kazon as rooted in gang violence and warfare by clarifying: [...] "Our intention was to create a sort of disorganized anarchy, them-against-them as much as them-against-us." ...|$|E
