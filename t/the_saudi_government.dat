5|$|Although the country's {{reliance}} on foreign workers {{has been a}} concern to <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>government</b> since the mid-1950s, the situation has persisted because of a reluctance by Saudis to take on menial work and a shortage of Saudi candidates for skilled jobs. This has, in part, been blamed on the Saudi education system, which {{has been criticized for}} its emphasis on religion and rote learning. The Saudi economy has, therefore, remained dependent on Westerners for expertise in specialised industries and on the Asian workforce for the construction industry as well as for menial and unskilled tasks. In response, since 1995 <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>government</b> has initiated a policy of Saudization, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals. For example, in 2000, it was decreed that the work force of businesses with more than 20 employees must be at least 25 per cent Saudi. In the private sector, there has been a reluctance to employ Saudis and Saudization is generally considered to have been a failure. Saudis themselves may be unwilling to take certain jobs, considering them to lack social value.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>government</b> only {{recognises}} {{contracts for}} foreign workers written in Arabic.

Wages for foreign workers vary, depending on the position, although in general Saudis holding similar positions earn more.|$|E

5|$|No {{political}} parties or national elections are permitted in Saudi Arabia {{and according to}} The Economist's 2010 Democracy Index, <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>government</b> is the seventh most authoritarian regime from among the 167 countries rated.

The Saudi press is strictly censored and articles on Saudi dissidents are banned. Saudi censorship is considered among the most restrictive {{in the world and the}} country blocks broad swathes of the Internet. After protests occurred in early 2011, the government banned all public demonstrations and marches.|$|E
5|$|Qadis {{generally}} have degrees in Sharia law from an Islamic university recognized by <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>government</b> with, in many cases, a post-graduate qualification from the Institute of Higher Judiciary in Riyadh. The training received from such Sharia law degrees is entirely religious in character {{and is based}} on the Qur'an and centuries old religious treatises with no reference to, for example, modern commercial issues. Although most judges have been educated and appointed under the current system, some of the older judges received the traditional qadi's training of years of instruction by a religious mentor in a mosque.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>government</b> is also putting greater {{resources}} into combating unauthorized distribution of software, printed material, recordings and videos.

Before {{disposing}} of the body, the U.S. called <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>government,</b> who approved of burying {{the body in}} the ocean. Muslim religious rites were performed aboard Carl Vinson in the North Arabian Sea within 24 hours of bin Laden's death. Preparations began at 10:10am local time and at-sea burial was completed at 11am. The body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet and placed in a weighted plastic bag. An officer read prepared religious remarks which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. Afterward, bin Laden's body was placed onto a flat board.

5|$|Between 1996 and 2000, Saudi Arabia acceded to four UN {{human rights}} {{conventions}} and, in 2004, the government approved {{the establishment of}} the National Society for Human Rights (NSHR), staffed by government employees, to monitor their implementation. To date, the activities of the NSHR have been limited and doubts remain over its neutrality and independence. Saudi Arabia was one of only eight countries that did not accept the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights when it was launched in 1948. Now, only Saudi Arabia remains openly opposed to the declaration. In response to the continuing criticism of its human rights record, <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>government</b> points to the special Islamic character of the country, and asserts that this justifies a different social and political order.|$|E
5|$|In response, the United Nations {{began to}} pass a series of resolutions {{demanding}} the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Afraid that Saudi Arabia would be invaded next, <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>government</b> requested immediate military aid. As a result, the United States began marshalling forces {{from a variety of}} nations, styled the Coalition, on the Arabian peninsula. Initially, Saddam Hussein attempted to deter Coalition military action by threatening Kuwait's and Iraq's petroleum production and export. In December 1990, Iraq experimented with the use of explosives to destroy wellheads {{in the area of the}} Ahmadi loading complex, developing their capability to destroy Kuwait's petroleum infrastructure on a large scale. On 16 January, Iraqi artillery destroyed an oil storage tank in Khafji, Saudi Arabia, and on 19 January the pumps at the Ahmadi loading complex were opened, pouring crude oil into the Persian Gulf. The oil flowed into the sea at a rate of 200,000 barrels a day, becoming one of the worst ecological disasters to that date.|$|E

5|$|Making {{necessary}} arrangements {{each year}} for {{the growing number of}} pilgrims poses a logistic challenge for the government of Saudi Arabia, which has, since the 1950s, spent more than $100 billion to increase pilgrimage facilities. Major issues like housing, transportation, sanitation, and health care have been addressed and improved greatly by the government by introducing various development programs, with the result that pilgrims now enjoy modern facilities and perform various rites at ease. <b>The</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>government</b> often sets quota for various countries to keep the pilgrims' number at a manageable level, and arranges huge security forces and CCTV cameras to maintain overall safety during Hajj. Various institutions and government programs, such as the Haj subsidy offered in India or the Tabung Haji based in Malaysia assist pilgrims in covering the costs of the journey. For 2014 Hajj, special Hajj information desks were set up at Pakistani airports to assist the pilgrims.|$|E
