After mature consideration, we provided ourselves with a supply of such things as were most necessary and suitable--such as <b>tobacco,</b> <b>powder,</b> and shot, and ball, a few trade-guns, several pieces of brightly-coloured cloth, packages of beads (some white enamelled, others of coloured glass), coffee and tea, knives, scissors, rings, and a variety of other knick-knacks. These, with a little brandy to be used medicinally, our blankets and camp cooking utensils, formed a heavy load for ten men; but, of course, as we advanced, the load was lightened by the consumption of our provisions and the giving away of goods. The additions which I made, however, in the shape of stuffed specimens, began in the course of time to more than counterbalance this advantage.|$|E

The leaves were dried and ground separately into fine powders. These were mixed with the roselle seeds and put into the various containers. The neem leaf <b>powder</b> (NLP) and <b>tobacco</b> leaf <b>powder</b> (TLP) were each applied {{at the rate of}} 50 % (W/W) and 100 % for wood ash (WA). Also added were the desiccants (10 g charcoal and 10 g toasted rice) to absorb any moisture that might be generated during respiration of the seeds in the containers. Some seeds were stored in the containers without dressings or desiccants to serve as control. The containers and their contents were stored at room temperature (21 - 30 °C) and relative humidity (40 - 70 %) for a period of one-year after which they were sown to determine viability and vigour. After 14 and 20 days since sowing, the germination percentage and vigour index data were recorded, respectively. NLP and WA did not have any adverse effect on the vigour of treated roselle seeds. The best container for roselle seed storage was plastic containers, followed by bottles and polythene bags in that order. The results also showed that charcoal was a better desiccant than toasted rice and the former improved the viability and vigour of seeds stored in gourds and earthen pots...|$|R

At the time of its first occupancy by United States troops there was a small Mexican hamlet there, containing probably less than one hundred souls. There was, in addition, a small American trading post, at which goods were sold to Mexican smugglers. All goods were put up in compact packages of about one hundred pounds each, suitable for loading on pack mules. Two of these packages made a load for an ordinary Mexican mule, and three for the larger ones. The bulk of the trade was in leaf tobacco, and domestic cotton-cloths and calicoes. The Mexicans had, before the arrival of the army, but little to offer in exchange except silver. The trade in tobacco was enormous, considering the population to be supplied. Almost every Mexican above the age of ten years, and many much younger, smoked the cigarette. Nearly every Mexican carried a pouch of leaf <b>tobacco,</b> <b>powdered</b> by rolling in the hands, and a roll of corn husks to make wrappers.

METHODS: From 2002 to 2005, we interviewed 636 patients and 615 controls from Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, frequency-matched by centre, age, sex, and childhood household type (urban/rural). Conditional logistic regression {{was used to evaluate}} the association of lifestyles with NPC risk, controlling for socioeconomic status and dietary risk factors. RESULTS: Cigarette smoking and snuff (<b>tobacco</b> <b>powder</b> with additives) intake were significantly associated with differentiated NPC but not with undifferentiated carcinoma (UCNT), which is the major histological type of NPC in these populations. As demonstrated by a stratified permutation test and by conditional logistic regression, marijuana smoking significantly elevated NPC risk independently of cigarette smoking, suggesting dissimilar carcinogenic mechanisms between cannabis and tobacco. Domestic cooking fumes intake by using kanoun (compact charcoal oven) during childhood increased NPC risk, whereas exposure during adulthood had less effect. Neither alcohol nor shisha (water pipe) was associated with risk. CONCLUSION: Tobacco, cannabis and domestic cooking fumes intake are {{risk factors for}} NPC in western North Africa...|$|E

Efficacy of this method as a deterrent was significantly better in the low-rainfall regime relative to medium and high-rainfall regimes. The initial promising results present a case for more rigorous experimentation; these would help determine if the elephants avoiding the rope are responding physiologically to the chilli-tobacco smell or merely reacting cautiously to a novel substance in their environment...|$|E
