[...] The Green Line relies more on operators than its signal system compared to other lines, especially where trams are driven across or even in automobile lanes on surface rails.

The term passenger information display has widely replaced the term platform display as station design can include different types of information displays - like a departure board in the main hall, a shorter list in the tunnels and an announcement of the next train on each platform side - which all get their information from a central electronic railway control system. Additionally passenger information displays have come into use for bus and tram stops as well where the destination display equipment is technically similar.|$|E

RailRadar GPS shows trains running tracking data neatly displayed on a Google Map. The map also indicates the on-current time status of trains. Trains running on time have Green indicators, while those running late are marked red.|$|E

5000|$|SelTrac {{is offered}} in two ways: 1. A {{complete}} integrated solution in which movement authority and interlocking are integrated within wayside zone controllers; this reduces equipment and potential interfacing issues. Integrating {{the management of}} the interlocking with <b>train</b> <b>location</b> information, as communicated through the CBTC system, allows faster response times, more tightly controlled movements, and easier expandability and adaptability. Interfaces within the zone controller are more easily designed than those between subsystems. The integrated system knows the position of each train to a high degree of accuracy. It can control the behavior of the train at all times and, in response to changing conditions, can modify the behavior to ensure safety of the system while offering maximum service.It can adapt its algorithms to take advantage of individual train behavior, and change parameters to ensure optimum use of resources, such as platform availability and traction power. The Limit of Movement Authority setting logic has a high impact on the end system performance, i.e. managing the interlocking in an integrated manner. Interlocking and switch control logic is optimized using position reports of communicating trains. The integrated design includes: ...|$|E
