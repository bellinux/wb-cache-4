Similarly, in three dimensions <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> one quasiregular honeycomb, which has eight tetrahedra and six octahedra at each polyhedron vertex.

5|$|Little {{is known}} about Leofric, as his cathedral town was not a centre of {{historical}} writing, and he took little part in events outside his diocese. Little notice was taken {{of his life and}} activities; only a few charters originated in his household and there is only one listing of gifts to his diocese. No official acts from his episcopate have survived, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> a brief death notice in the Leofric Missal, although no notice of his death occurs in the contemporary Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. He occurs as a witness to royal charters.|$|E

5|$|The 10th-century Persian {{geographer}} Ibn al-Faqih {{wrote of}} a local legend related {{by the people of}} Lajjun regarding the source of the abundant spring used as the town's primary water source over the ages: <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> outside al-Lajjun a large stone of round form, over which is built a dome, which they call the Mosque of Abraham. A copious stream of water flows from under the stone and it is reported that Abraham struck the stone with his staff, and there immediately flowed from it water enough to suffice for the supply {{of the people of the}} town, and also to water their lands. The spring continues to flow down to the present day.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding the idea that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading {{and that we should}} use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.|$|E
5|$|After {{the five}} heroine's routes are completed, the story shifts to a setting amid a ruined Kazamatsuri where Kotarou {{encounters}} Kagari {{in a world}} after re-evolution, still on the Moon. Kotarou {{at this point is}} a unified entity of all the Kotarous from all timelines where humanity was destroyed and he has memories of these events. The Moon's Kagari is trying to research a way so the Earth and humanity are not destroyed, and Kotarou attempts to buy her time while fighting a hoard of familiars summoned by Sakura Kashima of Gaia whose resolve is to annihilate humanity by killing Kagari. Kotarou and the entire cast rejoin together to protect Kagari, who manages to finish her plan to allow the Earth and humanity to coexist by sending the Moon's life force back to Earth. In the past, the Earth had sent this energy to the Moon so life could continue. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> enough energy and resources left for a final re-evolution.|$|E

25|$|After the {{adoption}} of the euro, policy changed to linking currencies of EU countries outside the eurozone to the euro (having the common currency as a central point). The goal was to improve the stability of those currencies, as well as to gain an evaluation mechanism for potential eurozone members. This mechanism is known as ERM II and has superseded ERM. Currently <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> one currency in the ERM II, the Danish krone.|$|E

25|$|Now {{expand the}} {{situation}} to have one sentient being observing the device. Now, they too enter the indefinite state. Their eyes, body, and brain are seeing both spins at the same time. The mind however, stochastically chooses one of the directions, {{and that is what}} the mind sees. When this observer goes over to the second detector, their body will see both results. Their mind will choose the result that agrees with the first detector, and the observer will see the expected results. However, the observers mind seeing one result does not directly affect the distant state - <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> no wave function in which the expected correlations do not exist. The true correlation only happens when they actually go over to the second detector.|$|E
25|$|In his Ph.D. dissertation, John Nash {{proposed}} two {{interpretations of}} his equilibrium concept, {{with the objective}} of showing how equilibrium points ``(...) can be connected with observable phenomenon. One interpretation is rationalistic: if we assume that players are rational, know the full structure of the game, the game is played just once, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> one Nash equilibrium, then players will play according to that equilibrium. This idea was formalized by Aumann, R. and A. Brandenburger, 1995, ``Epistemic Conditions for Nash Equilibrium, Econometrica, 63, 1161-1180 who interpreted each player's mixed strategy as a conjecture about the behaviour of other players and have shown that if the game and the rationality of players is mutually known and these conjectures are commonly know, then the conjectures must be a Nash equilibrium (a common prior assumption is needed for this result in general, but not in the case of two players. In this case, the conjectures need only be mutually known).|$|E
25|$|The {{mortality}} rate in Lower Kersal and Charlestown {{is more than}} twice the national average and approximately one third of the population has a chronic illness. Although 52 General Practitioners serve the area, only three are located within it and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> one pharmacy and one part-time dentist. New Deal for Communities (NDC) was a programme {{that was part of the}} Government strategy to regenerate deprived neighbourhoods in England. The two neighbourhoods covered by the Salford NDC were Charlestown and Lower Kersal. A grant of £53m was awarded to the area and a 10-year plan developed. It focused on health, crime, education and employment, young people, building communities and the physical environment. Plans for new health services in Kersal, including two GP practices, a pharmacy, a healthy living project, children and young people's health services and community health services, were implemented with the opening of the Horizon Centre, part of the Willow Tree Healthy Living Centre, at 94 Littleton Road in 2007.|$|E

500|$|Psychologists and neuroscientists {{generally}} {{agree that}} the hippocampus {{plays an important role}} in the formation of new memories about experienced events (episodic or autobiographical memory). Part of this function is hippocampal involvement in the detection of new events, places and stimuli. Some researchers regard the hippocampus as part of a larger medial temporal lobe memory system responsible for general declarative memory (memories that can be explicitly verbalized—these would include, for example, memory for facts in addition to episodic memory). The hippocampus also encodes emotional context from the amygdala. This partly why returning to a place (or context) where an emotional experience occurred may evoke that emotion. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> a deep emotional connection between episodic memories and places.|$|E
500|$|Since encountering {{satellite}} {{news feeds}} {{when he worked}} on Saturday Night Live, Shearer has been fascinated with {{the contents of the}} video that does not air. Shearer refers to these clips as found objects. [...] "I thought, wow, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> an unending supply of this material, and it's wonderful and fascinating and funny and sometimes haunting – but it's always good," [...] said Shearer. He collects this material and uses it on Le Show and on his website. In 2008, he assembled video clips of newsmakers from this collection into an art installation titled [...] "The Silent Echo Chamber" [...] which was exhibited at The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, Connecticut. The exhibit was also displayed in 2009 at Institut Valencià d'Art Modern (IVAM) in Valencia, Spain and in 2010 at the New Orleans Contemporary Arts Center.|$|E

[...] Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD, stated that [...] "There's a lot to laugh with here and a cast of characters that grow quickly on you as you start finding those you favor and those you don't." [...] Andrew Shelton from Anime Meta explains that [...] "The character of the girls is extremely well brought out. The superb observation, and ability to capture expression, makes the anime incredibly fun to watch in addition to meeting the story requirements. The action, and very rich comedy, are also wonderfully represented. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> so much meaning, and charm, {{in even the most}} minor of expressions."
