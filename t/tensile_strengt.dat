40|$|The Huge {{volume of}} urban garbage despite limited space of garbage dump and {{inappropriate}} handling have become complicated and never ended problem. Helped to these issue, {{the research on}} Forming Ecocement from organic garbage was carried out. Ecocement was made from the mixture of the ash of organic garbage and limestone. The ashing was started by putting up the dry leaves and branches and some anorganic garbage (i. e paper) in pirolisis reactor, heated at temperatures 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 (oC). The resulted ash was mixed with limestone at (60 : 40); (55 : 45); (50 : 50); (45 : 55); (40 : 60) (%) ratio and blended with water. Next, the mixture was heated in a temperature of 900 oC for 1 hour. The ash analysis from the pirolisis process indicated that the best ash to produce cement was one that was heated in the temperature of 300 oC {{in the composition of}} CaO = 200. 591, 8 ppm SiO 2 = 160. 020, 8 ppm Al 2 O 3 = 56. 800, 9 ppm dan Fe 2 O 3 = 5. 510, 6 ppm, while the best ratio of ash : lime stone is 55 % : 45 % in the composition of CaO= 60, 8 %, SiO 2 = 16, 3 %, Al 2 O 3 = 4, 8 %, Fe 2 O 3 = 0, 3 %.

40|$|International audienceWe have {{characterized}} the melt rheological {{behavior and the}} solid tensile properties of sawdust/polyethylene composites prepared in an internal mixer. Various concentrations (from 0 to 60 wt %) and three particle sizes have been tested, in presence of a coupling agent (maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene). In the molten state, for each particle size, a mastercurve of the complex viscosity as function of frequency can be plotted, using a shift factor depending oil weight fraction. We show that the shift factors can be described by a Krieger-Dougherty law, leading to a "universal" viscosity law of the Carreau-Yasuda type. In the solid state, the presence of sawdust increases Young modulus in uniaxial elongation, mainly for small size particles, but reduces dramatically deformation at break and <b>tensile</b> <b>strengt...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} Zn and Mg amounts on the {{solidification}} characteristics, microstructure, thermal conductivity and tensile strength of Al-Zn-Mg-Fe alloys were investigated {{for the development}} of high thermal conductivity aluminium alloys for die casting. Zn and Mg amounts in Al-Zn-Mg-Fe alloys had a little effect on the liquidus / solidus temperature, the latent heat for solidification and the fluidity of Al-Zn-Mg-Fe alloys. Thermo-physical modelling of Al-Zn-Mg-Fe alloys by JMatPro program showed MgZn 2, AlCuMgZn and Al 3 Fe phases on microstructure of their alloys. Increase of Zn and Mg amounts in Al-Zn-Mg-Fe alloys resulted in gradual reduction of the thermal conductivity of their alloys.

40|$|Understanding the {{complete}} stress-strain behavior of shotcrete {{is extremely important}} in ground support design; especially in cases where large deformations are expected such as around mine excavations at great depth. The application of non-linear numerical modeling to mining industry problems has increased in recent years. More realistic stress-strain response and failure criteria in complex plasticity models are also {{being used in the}} design of the larger, deeper mines. One of the factors to improve the reliability of numerical modeling is to properly define geotechnical parameters for both the rock mass and shotcrete surface support. Uniaxial and triaxial compression tests on steel fibre reinforced shotcrete (SFRS) have been used to quantify elastic-plastic response behaviour for both the peak and post-peak regions. The laboratory tests were conducted with a servo-controlled testing machine to obtain complete stress-strain curves.

40|$|Abstract: Due to the {{pozzolanic}} reactivity, {{rice husk}} ash (RHA) {{is used as}} supplementary cementing material in mortar and concrete and has demonstrated significant influence in improving the mechanical and durability properties of mortar and concrete. It has economical and technical advantages to use in concrete. In this paper, a critical review on the influences of RHA {{on the strength of}} mortar and concrete are mainly presented. In addition, properties and pozzolanic activity of RHA, advantages and disadvantages of supplementary use of RHA in mortar/concrete are mentioned here. Based on the available documented literature, it can be concluded that RHA could be used as supplementary cementing material up to a certain level of replacement (about 20 - 30 % of binder) without sacrificing strength of concrete. Proper consumption of these RHA contributes in solving environmental pollution and production of cost-effective concrete; it can also play a vital role for the production of sustainable concrete.

40|$|Brass {{targets were}} {{irradiated}} with various laser pulses of Excimer laser ranging from 1200 to 3000 for constant fluence of 3. 4 J/cm 2 in oxygen atmosphere (100 Torr). The surface morphology and crystallographic {{analyses were performed}} by using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD). SEM analysis reveals the formation of laser-induced micro-sized cavi-ties, bumps, cones and wave-like ridges with non-uniform shape and density distribution. These features are formed for all number of pulses; however with increasing number of pulses from 1200 to 2400, the density of cavities decreases whereas, the wave-like ridges become more pro-nounced and bump-formation is vanished. For maximum number of 3000 shots, the appearance of cones and wave-like ridges becomes diffusive, whereas the density and size of cavities increase again. XRD analysis demonstrates that no new phases are formed in irradiated brass. However, the change in peak intensity along with lower and higher angle shifting is observed which is at-tributed to generation of laser induced stresses.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{manufacturing}} of the glass fibre reinforced epoxy composite laminate as per the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) Standards. This laminate consists of matrix and reinforcement. Epoxy {{is used as a}} structural matrix material which is then reinforced by glass fiber, combining glass fibres with resin matrix results in composites that are strong, lightweight, corrosion-resistant and dimensionally stable. They also provide good design flexibility, high dielectric strength and act as inflammable materials. Their tremendous strength-to-weight and design flexibility make them ideal in structural components for the aerospace industry. In this paper the glass fibre reinforced epoxy composite is manufactured into six different parts each having ratios of glass fibre to epoxy resin as 0 : 100, 20 : 80, 40 : 60, 60 : 40, 80 : 20, 100 : 0 respectively and are compared for ultimate tensile strength, impact strength and flexural strength of the material by conducting experiment such as tensile test, flexural test and impact test.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{extracellular}} matrix of epiphyseal cartilage tissue was preserved {{in a state}} believed to resemble closely that of native tissue following processing by high pressure freezing, freeze substitution, and low temperature embedding (HPF/FS). Proteoglycans (PG) were preserved in an extended state and were apparent as a reticulum of fine filamentous threads throughout the matrix. Within this network, two morphologically discrete components were discernible and identified with the carbohydrate and protein components of PG molecules Numerous points of contact were clearly visible between components of the PG network and cross-sectioned Collagen fibrils and also between PG components and chondrocytic plasmalemmata. These observations provide direct morphological indication that such relationships may exist in native epiphyseal cartilage tissue. The intercellular matrix ofepiphyseal cartilage tissue consists of a proteoglycan (PG) ' phase trapped within a network of collagen fibrils (24, 28). It is {{by virtue of their}} presence in high concentration (7, 11, 24) that the PG are able to exert a considerable pressure upon the collagen network and, as a consequence of this, the matrix is rendered resilient to compression from external forces.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to achieve Ti-β alloys without {{considerable}} toxic elements (Al and V) with lower elastic moduli to improve the mechanical compatibility with the bone (17 GPa- 35 GPa) [1, 2]. Ti- 35 Nb- 7 Zr and Ti- 41, 1 Nb- 7, 1 Zr alloys were produced in fusion by arc melting under argon atmosphere. The ingots, with the initial diameter of 18 mm were submitted to solution heat treatment, cool rotary forging and recrystallization treatment until 6 mm of diameter. The microstructural analyses were performed using Optical Microscopy, X-ray diffraction and hardness. The mechanical characterization was evaluated through uniaxial tensile tests. The results showed that properties are dependent on the compositions studied. Microstructure results indicated that both alloys are Ti-β. Ti- 35 Nb- 7 Zr in β-solution treated condition posses the lowest value of hardness (157 HV). Vickers hardness values for alloys within 35 Nb and 41, 1 Nb, in the recrystallization condition were very close 161 and 169 HV, respectively. The Ti- 35 Nb- 7 Zr alloy presented the lowest elastic modulus (54 GPa) and the highest ductility, based on reduction of area and elongation without change <b>tensile</b> <b>strengt...</b>|$|E

Individually penned Finnish Landrace and Yorkshire pigs and their crosses (30 kg; no. = 70) were offered the basal diet with no added betaine or choline, or the basal diet supplemented {{with low to}} moderate doses (250, 500 or 1000 mg/kg) of betaine (Betafin (R) S 1), or with a similar molar amount of choline (578, 1155 or 2310 mg/kg of choline chloride). The maize-soya-bean-meal basal diet was formulated to contain 12. 3 MJ/kg digestible energy, 155 g/kg crude protein and 7. 4, 4. 4 and 4. 3 g/kg digestible lysine, threonine and methionine + cystine, respectively. Oat hull meal (100 g/kg) was added to reduce the diatary energy concetration. The pigs were on a restricted feeding level, 1. 5 to 3. 0 kg food per day (proportionally 0. 8 of ad libitum intake) for 75 days. Daily weight gain and food-to-gain ratio improved linearly (P < 0. 01) with increasing diatary betaine. Carcass weight increased linearly (P < 0. 01) but slaughter loss proportion, backfat and sidefat thicknesses and lean proportions in ham and carcass were unaffected by dietary betaine level. Linear betaine level increased linearly (by up to a proportion of 0. 62 {{in comparison with the}} control) with dietary betaine addition (P < 0. 05) and betaine tended to improve linearly the <b>tensile</b> <b>strengt</b> of the proximal ileaum (P = 0. 07). The presence of choline had no effect on any of the parameters. these results indicate that low to moderate doses of dietary betaine improved the growth and the efficiency of food utilization of growing-finishing pigs. Pigs on betaine diets had heavier carcasses without a relative increase in carcass fat. Choline had no such effects in pigs offered the restricted amount of diet. Liver betaine concentration increased with level of betaine in the diet whereas the betaine precursor choline did not affect hepatic betaine. v 2003 okEripainoksia saatavissa tekijält...|$|E
40|$|The need of wood {{as one of}} raw {{materials}} in furniture industry keeps increasing. One of efforts to reduce wood consumption is to develop research by creating composite design from material that contains sellulose to be particle board. Particle board is one of material alternatives that can be wood substitute. The objective {{of this research is}} to investigate the effect of natural-adhesive-mixture composition (acacia bark and gambier) with oil-palm-empty bunch toward mechanical property of particle board. Characterization of particle board was carried out by undertaking mechanical property testing (tensile strength and compressive strength) under wet and dry conditions. Composition variations of adhesive and oil-palm-empty bunch were 30 : 70; 40 : 60; 50 : 50; 60 : 40; 70 : 30. Making process of particle board is carried out by mixing oil-palm-empty bunch and adhesive with addition of 2 % para-formaldehyde and water as much of 10 %. Furthermore, the mixture is compressed by using Hot Press at temperature of 150 oC and pressure of 10 kg/cm 2 for 15 minutes. The research result indicates that the higher the adhesive composition (either adhesives of acacia bark or gambier), particle board resulted is better. In dry condition,  values of the tensile strength of particle boards  that have acacia bark adhesive and gambier adhesive have range of 84. 2 - 104 Kgf/cm 2 and 83. 4 - 81. 5 kg/cm 2, respectively. Whereas, values of compressive strength of particle boards that have adhesives of acacia bark and gambier are in the range of 6. 8 - 10. 5 kg/cm 2   and 6. 3 - 9. 3 kg/cm 2, respectively. The values of tensile strength and compressive strength are obtained on compositions  of adhesive: oil-palm-empty bunch ≥ 40 : 60, and they have fulfilled satandard of SNI 03 - 2105 - 1996. The values of tensile strength and compressive strength of particle board in wet condition, either adhesives of acacia bark or gambier, have not fulfilled standard of SNI 03 - 2105 - 1996.

Materials and methods: Four commercially available bulk-fill RBCs (Tetric® N-Ceram, SonicFill™, Smart Dentin Replacement (SDR™) Posterior Flowable Material, and Filtek™ Posterior Restorative) were used in this study. A total of 72 cylindrical specimens of each RBC (n= 288) were prepared and subjected to Vickers microhardness, compressive strength, and diametral tensile strength tests at high (1200 mW/cm 2) and low (650 mW/cm 2) curing light intensities (each n= 12). Results were evaluated using independent and paired sample t-tests, one-way analysis of variance, and Tukey’s post hoc test. All tests were performed at a significance level of P< 0. 05. Results: The highest mean microhardness was observed for SonicFill (58. 3 Vickers hardness number [VHN]) cured using high-intensity light. Although having the least mean microhardness values, a significant difference was observed between SDR cured using high-intensity light and that cured using low-intensity light (P< 0. 05). In the total sample, the highest mean compressive strength was obtained for SonicFill (262. 6  MPa), followed by SDR (253. 2  MPa), both cured using high-intensity light, and the least was measured for Tetric N-Ceram cured using low-intensity light (214. 3  MPa). At high and low curing light intensities, diametral tensile strength for all RBCs except SonicFill was significant (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: A higher curing light intensity (1200 mW/cm 2) had a positive influence on the compressive and tensile strength of the four bulk-fill RBCs and microhardness of two materials tested compared with lower curing light intensity (650 mW/cm 2). SonicFill showed the greatest microhardness and compressive strength significantly for both curing light intensities and greater diametral tensile strength with high-intensity light, although not significant. SDR cured with high-intensity light showed the greatest diametral tensile strength among the four materials.
