500|$|Marable {{studied the}} Autobiography {{manuscript}} [...] "raw materials" [...] archived by Haley's biographer, Anne Romaine, and described a critical {{element of the}} collaboration, Haley's writing tactic to capture the voice of his subject accurately, a disjoint system of data mining that included notes on scrap paper, in-depth interviews, and long [...] "free style" [...] discussions. Marable writes, [...] "Malcolm also {{had a habit of}} scribbling notes <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke." [...] Haley would secretly [...] "pocket these sketchy notes" [...] and reassemble them in a sub rosa attempt to integrate Malcolm X's [...] "subconscious reflections" [...] into the [...] "workable narrative". This is an example of Haley asserting authorial agency during the writing of the Autobiography, indicating that their relationship was fraught with minor power struggles. Wideman and Rampersad agree with Marable's description of Haley's book-writing process.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Sheen {{appeared}} in a supporting role as the boyfriend of Tina Fey in the comedy Admission, with Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice describing the character as [...] "a whiskery, elfin academic who chuckles <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> reads the Canterbury Tales prologue aloud in bed, in Middle English, no less. (Sheen is scarily good at this.)" [...] In 2014, he starred in the fantasy children's film Mariah Mundi and the Midas Box. R. Kurt Osenlund of Slant Magazine said [...] "the ever-versatile Sheen brings an artful hamminess to his role" [...] but Matt Pais of RedEye found him [...] "insufficiently zany" [...] in [...] "a part that Robert Downey Jr. would nail but never accept." [...] His second film role of 2014 was a minor role in the political thriller Kill the Messenger. Also in 2014, he starred in IFC's six-episode The Spoils of Babylon, a television parody of classic, sweeping miniseries, in which he played the husband of Kristen Wiig's character.|$|E

[...] Losts co-show runner/executive producer/head writer/co-creator Damon Lindelof enjoyed Kevin Durand's {{supporting}} performance as Tucker and checked {{to see if}} he was available for a role on Lost. [...] The casting director had Durand read a page of dialogue for the new character Keamy; Durand was offered the role in early October and he traveled to Honolulu in Hawaii—where Lost is filmed on location—by October 17, 2007. [...] A former stand-up comic and rapper from Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, with the stage name [...] "Kevy D", Durand had seen only around six episodes of Lost by the time that he won the part. [...] When he was shooting, he was confused by the story, later stating [...] "I didn't want to know anything or be attached to anybody. [...] I'm glad I didn't. [...] But now that I'm on it, I'll watch all of it." [...] Durand revealed his appreciation for the cast, crew and scripts and the fact that he had the chance to act as someone with a similar physical appearance <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had previously done roles that had not prompted recognition from viewers on the street.|$|E
