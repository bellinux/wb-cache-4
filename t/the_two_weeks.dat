5|$|Several {{nightjar}} {{species are}} known to be more likely to lay in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> before the full moon than the during the waning moon, possibly because insect food may be easier to catch as the moon waxes.

This strategy means that a second brood in July would also have a favourable lunar aspect.|$|E

40|$|Ramadan fasting for Muslims means {{abstinence}} from eating, drinking, {{and smoking}} from sunrise to sunset. There are concerns whether {{the occurrence of}} renal colic increases {{during the month of}} Ramadan. In view of the importance of fasting among Muslims, the occurrence of renal colic during Ramadan fasting has been compared during <b>the</b> following periods: <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> before commencement of Ramadan (stage- 1), during <b>the</b> first <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> (stage- 2), <b>the</b> last <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> (stage- 3), and, <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> after Ramadan (stage- 4). This was a prospective observational study, which was carried out in patients with symptoms of renal colic who were referred to the emergency wards in two major hospitals in Iran. During the study period, 610 subjects were admitted with renal colic during the four periods of study; there were 441 males (72. 3 %) and 169 females (27. 7 %). The number of patients with renal colic was highest during <b>the</b> first <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> of Ramadan in comparison with the other periods (stage- 1 : 157, stage- 2 : 195, stage- 3 : 139, stage- 4 : 119, P < 0. 05].

5|$|At {{the start}} of conference play, the Bearcats were 4–1, and their only loss was against top-five {{opponent}} Oklahoma. With Pike still injured, Cincinnati beat Rutgers, 13–10, in the Bearcats' first Big East game of the season. The Bearcats suffered their second defeat {{of the season in}} the following week, however, losing to the UConn Huskies, 40–16. Pike returned from the injury and had the Bearcats leading at halftime, but he left the game at the half when numbness in his non-throwing hand prevented him from being able to take the snap. In <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> that followed the loss to the Huskies, Cincinnati recovered to beat two top-25 opponents: No. 23 South Florida and No. 20 West Virginia. The two victories pushed the Bearcats to a 3–1 conference record and the No. 22 position in the AP Poll before Cincinnati's annual rivalry game against Louisville. That game, also known as the Battle for The Keg of Nails, ended in a Cincinnati victory {{for the first time since}} 2002.|$|E
5|$|In Diane's {{immediate}} aftermath, one of {{the first}} priorities in response was to distribute adequate inoculations for typhoid amongst the widespread areas left without clean drinking water. The United States Army assisted in search and rescue operations using helicopters. After the floods of Hurricane Diane, more than 100,000people fled to shelter or away from their houses. The American Red Cross quickly provided aid to the affected residents, using churches and public buildings to house homeless people. In <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> after the storm, Americans donated about $10million to the Red Cross. The countries of Great Britain, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, France, Austria, and Venezuela offered aid to help the flood victims, sending emergency supplies. Additional flooding affected New England in September and October 1955, although neither was as major as those caused by Hurricane Diane. Following Diane, hundreds of companies affected by the flooding installed waterproof doors and windows to preempt similar disasters in the future.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> {{following}} 27 July, German transports moved nearly 2,500 {{troops of}} the Army of Africa to Spain; 1,500 between 29 July and 5 August. Transport planes were moved to Spain from Germany via San Remo in Italy. German aircraft continued to provide cover for ship movements in the Strait of Gibraltar. There were fuel shortages, however, these eased as more fuel arrived from Germany. By 11 October, the mission's official end, 13,500 troops, 127 machine guns and 36 field guns had been carried into Spain from Morocco. Over this period there was a movement from training and supply missions of overt combat. The operation leader, Alexander von Scheele, was replaced by Walter Warlimont, and was moved into Franco's headquarters to coordinate military and diplomatic efforts. In September, 86 tons of bombs, 40 Panzer PzKpfw I tanks and 122 personnel had been landed in Spain; they were accompanied with 108 aircraft in the July–October period, split between aircraft for the Nationalist faction itself and planes for German volunteers in Spain.|$|E
5|$|The {{stocks and}} sails were {{made during the}} two work-ins held in July and August, a total of 41 people {{attending}} over <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks.</b> A second-hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it {{was found to be}} unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or laminated stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made.|$|E
5|$|This shift by Timex came at {{an ideal}} time for Sinclair. The ZX80 had proved {{more popular than}} {{expected}} and Sinclair's existing manufacturer, a small electronics company in St Ives, lacked the resources {{to deal with the}} demand. Timex took over production of the ZX80 late in 1980. The arrangement worked well for both companies and Timex took on the manufacture of the ZX81, aided by capital investment in its Dundee plant. Sinclair initially planned to produce 10,000 ZX81s a month, rising to 30,000 a month within a year. However, Timex initially had significant problems in producing enough ZX81s to satisfy demand. As a consequence, it took up to nine weeks for ZX81s to be delivered by mail order. It was not until September 1981, five months after the launch of the ZX81, that the delivery times finally came down to the promised twenty-eight days. Those who already owned or had recently ordered the ZX80 were not excluded; anyone who had ordered a ZX80 in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> before the ZX81's launch would receive the newer machine, while existing owners were able to upgrade their ZX80s by plugging an extra £20 ROM chip into the circuit board.|$|E
