25|$|Facilitation is a {{significant}} ecological process that produces community-level effects through individual interactions. By improving dispersal, increasing access to resources, and providing protection from stress, predation, and competition, facilitation can impact community structure, diversity, and invasibility. Incorporation of facilitation into such classic theories as natural selection and niche separation should be a goal of current and future ecologists. This will require further research into the mechanisms of facilitation {{at the level of}} individuals, and the impacts of facilitation at the level of population, community, and ecosystem. Continued study of positive species interactions will serve <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>our</b> understanding of processes and application of theories.|$|E

[...] The programme was condemned by the current Ladywood MP, Labour's Shabana Mahmood: [...] "I found it shocking that Channel 4 or any other organisation would present poverty as entertainment. It was profoundly wrong." [...] In the Radio Times, Clare Short, who represented the constituency prior to Mahmood, said the series was [...] "totally unrepresentative" [...] of the area, and condemned it as [...] "crummy and misleading". Others have also criticised Benefits Street, arguing it does not present a balanced view of the subject. Labour MP Anne Begg, chair of the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee, said that the programme was a [...] "misrepresentation" [...] of people claiming benefits, arguing that it focused on those claiming unemployment benefits which makes up a small proportion of the overall welfare bill. Referring to the first episode that featured a shoplifter, Chris Williamson (also a Labour MP) said it was [...] "irresponsible" [...] to portray him as a typical benefits claimant. Owen Jones, a columnist for The Independent, described the series as [...] "medieval stocks updated for a modern format". In an article for the Birmingham Mail, writer and television personality Samantha Brick, a native of Birmingham, said that the series was an [...] "atrociously unbalanced" [...] view of the city.
