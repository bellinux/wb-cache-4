5|$|In the {{internal}} chronology of the Hainish universe, {{the events of}} <b>The</b> <b>Word</b> <b>for</b> World is Forest occur after The Dispossessed, in which both the ansible and the League of Worlds are unrealised dreams. However, the novel is located prior to Rocannon's World, in which Terran mindspeech {{is seen as a}} distinct possibility. A date of 2368 CE has been suggested by reviewers, although Le Guin provides no direct statement of the date.|$|E

5|$|Like Le Guin's earlier novel <b>The</b> <b>Word</b> <b>for</b> World Is Forest, {{this story}} {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} humans and their natural environment. The story also makes repeated references to the poetry of Andrew Marvell, including in the title. The story was republished in Le Guin's collections The Wind's Twelve Quarters and Buffalo Gals and Other Animal Presences, {{as well as in}} many other anthologies. It was nominated for the Hugo Award in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to future}} history works by other authors such as Isaac Asimov, Le Guin's fictional works {{set in the}} Hainish {{universe}} explore the idea of human society expanding across the galaxy. Books like The Dispossessed, The Left Hand of Darkness, and <b>The</b> <b>Word</b> <b>for</b> World is Forest also explore the effects of various social and political systems. Le Guin's later Hainish novels also challenge contemporary ideas about gender, ethnic differences, the value of ownership, and human beings' relationship to the natural world.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{the lion}} too {{has always had}} a close {{association}} with Iranian kingship. The garments and throne decorations of the Achaemenid kings were embroidered with lion motifs. The crown of the half-Persian Seleucid king Antiochus I was adorned with a lion. In the investiture inscription of Ardashir I at Naqsh-e Rustam, the breast armour of the king is decorated with lions. Further, in some Iranian dialects <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> king (shah) is pronounced as sher, homonymous with <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> lion. Islamic, Turkish, and Mongol influences also stressed the symbolic association of the lion and royalty. The earliest evidence for the use of a lion on a standard comes from the Shahnameh, which noted that the feudal house of Godarz (presumably a family of Parthian or Sassanid times) adopted a golden lion for its devices.|$|E
50|$|These {{should not}} be {{confused}} with <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> parents of offspring (i.e. sire and dam) or with <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>for</b> male and female of the species (i.e. dog and bitch).

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} how <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>for</b> "Jew" {{are used}} as insults and in pejorative ways in German and French, drawing on in-depth interviews. The forms, functions and effects of this phenomenon are similar despite the different languages and different contexts in France and Germany. The paper shows how the pejorative use of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>for</b> "Jew", "Jude" in German and "Juif" and "Feuj" in French, trivializes open anti-Semitism. The pejorative use of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>for</b> "Jew" leads to negative and therefore anti-Semitic connotations in the terms for "Jews" which are inseparable of anti-Semitic perceptions of Jews. What is more, the pejorative use of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>for</b> "Jew" enhances <b>the</b> establishment of a norm of verbal anti-Semitism and an anti-Semitic social order which both prepare the ground for anti-Semitic verbal and physical violence. ...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Word</b> <b>for</b> World Is Forest is {{a science}} fiction novella by American writer Ursula K.

It is part of Le Guin's Hainish Cycle.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Word</b> <b>for</b> World is Forest also {{challenges}} {{the idea of}} colonialism; the Terran colonists are depicted as being blind {{to the culture of}} the Athsheans, and convinced that they represent a higher form of civilization.

5|$|The shark {{was first}} {{described}} by Peron and Lesueur in 1822, {{and was given}} the name Squalus cuvier. Müller and Henle in 1837 renamed it Galeocerdo tigrinus.

Local names of many {{food and drink}} items have become Singlish and consist of words from different languages and are indicative of the multi-racial society in Singapore.

5|$|From {{the advent}} of very-large-scale {{integration}} (VLSI) computer-chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986, speed-up in computer architecture was driven by doubling computer word size—the amount of information the processor can manipulate per cycle. Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than the length of <b>the</b> <b>word.</b> <b>For</b> example, where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers, the processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer using the standard addition instruction, then add the 8 higher-order bits using an add-with-carry instruction and the carry bit from the lower order addition; thus, an 8-bit processor requires two instructions to complete a single operation, where a 16-bit processor {{would be able to}} complete the operation with a single instruction.|$|E
5|$|In Arabic, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> street (الشارع, ash-shāriʿ) {{is derived}} from a root whose other forms denote a place of entry or beginning, {{the point of a}} weapon, and law or {{lawfulness}} and legitimacy in both the secular and religious sense. Among those words are sharia, the term for Islamic religious and moral law. Shāriʿ itself {{can also be used to}} refer to a legislator or lawgiver, and when used with the definite article al- in a religious context is a reference to God as the source of all religious law.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Word</b> <b>for</b> World is Forest {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} Hainish universe, which Le Guin {{introduced}} in her first novel Rocannon's World, published in 1966. In this alternative history, human beings did not evolve on earth, but on Hain. The people of Hain colonized many neighboring planetary systems, including Terra (Earth) and Athshe, possibly a million years before the setting of the novels. The planets subsequently lost contact with each other, for reasons that Le Guin does not explain. Le Guin does not narrate the entire history of the Hainish universe at once, instead letting readers piece it together from various works.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two words}} in the Marquesan {{language}} for dog: peto, used in the Northern Marquesas, and nuhe, used in the Southern Marquesas. The former {{might have been an}} English loanword from pet or a Spanish loanword from perro (dog), although pero was an alternative for dog (kurī) in the related Māori language. According to another theory supporting its foreign origin, the name came from a New Haven dog named Pato left on Nuku Hiva by the American sea captain Edmund Fanning from 1798 to 1803. The South Marquesan Nuhe is unique in the Polynesian languages, but may have some connection to wanuhe, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> dog in the Papuan language of the Brumer Islands. French Catholic missionary René-Ildefonse Dordillon listed two other forms: mohoʻio and mohokio in his 1904 dictionary Grammaire et dictionnaire de la langue des iles Marquises.|$|E
5|$|At this hill, the Sabines, {{creeping}} to the Citadel, were let {{in by the}} Roman maiden Tarpeia. For this treachery, Tarpeia was {{the first}} to be punished by being flung from a steep cliff overlooking the Roman Forum. This cliff was later named the Tarpeian Rock after the Vestal Virgin, and became a frequent execution site. The Sabines, who immigrated to Rome following the Rape of the Sabine Women, settled on the Capitoline. The Vulcanal (Shrine of Vulcan), an 8th-century BC sacred precinct, occupied much of the eastern lower slopes of the Capitoline, at the head of what would later become the Roman Forum. The summit was the site of a temple for the Capitoline Triad, started by Rome's fifth king, Tarquinius Priscus (r. 616-579 BC), and completed by the seventh and last king, Tarquinius Superbus (535–496 BC). It was considered {{one of the largest and}} the most beautiful temples in the city (although little now remains). The city legend starts with the recovery of a human skull (<b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> head in Latin is caput) when foundation trenches were being dug for the Temple of Jupiter at Tarquin's order. Recent excavations on the Capitoline uncovered an early cemetery under the Temple of Jupiter.|$|E
