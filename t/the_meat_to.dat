5|$|On the Faroe Islands mainly Pilot Whales {{are killed}} by drive hunts for their meat and blubber. Other species are also killed on rare {{occasion}} such as the Northern bottlenose whale and Atlantic White-sided Dolphin. The Northern bottlenose whale is mainly killed when it accidentally swims {{too close to the}} beach and cannot return to the water. When the locals find them stranded or nearly stranded on the beach, they kill them and share <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>to</b> all the villagers.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of the U.S. railroad system, natural ice became used to transport larger quantities of goods much longer distances through the invention of the refrigerator car. The first refrigerator cars emerged in the late 1850s and early 1860s, and were crude constructions holding up to 3,000lbs (1,360kg) of ice, on top of which the food was placed. It was quickly found that placing meat directly on top of blocks of ice in cars caused it to perish; subsequent designs hung the meat from hooks, allowing <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>to</b> breathe, while the swinging carcasses improved the circulation in the car. After the Civil War, J. B Sutherland, John Bate and William Davis all patented improved refrigerator cars, which used stacks of ice placed at either end and improved air circulation to keep their contents cool. This improved ventilation was essential to avoid warm air building up in the car and causing damage to the goods. Salt could be added to the ice to increase the cooling effect to produce an iced refrigerator car, which preserved foods even better. For much of the 19th century, the different gauges of train lines made it difficult and time consuming to move chilled cargoes between lines, which was a problem when the ice was continually melting; by the 1860s, refrigerator cars with adjustable axles were being created to speed up this process.|$|E
25|$|Between 1977 and 1983, Hvalur Hf (the Icelandic whaling company {{owned and}} {{operated}} by Kristján Loftsson) had taken hundreds of undersized fin and sei whales and exported <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>to</b> Japan, according to an IWC report.|$|E

5000|$|Additional information: <b>The</b> <b>meat</b> is <b>to</b> be {{prepared}} {{in a simple}} way stove top (usually Khashlama) with minimal spices. It {{is not to be}} grilled over a fire. Also <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> is supposed <b>to</b> be shared among 7 families (relatives and/or neighbors). Frequently a Matagh takes place as a thank you to the gods after an accident or other life-threatening event with a good outcome.|$|R
25|$|Tahri or Tahari {{is similar}} to pulao–Biryani and is very popular in Aurangabad and Marathwada. Tahri is {{prepared}} by adding <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>to</b> the rice, as opposed to traditional Biryani where the rice {{is added to the}} meat.|$|E
25|$|Draining as {{much blood}} as {{possible}} from the carcass is necessary because blood causes <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>to</b> have an unappealing appearance and is a breeding ground for microorganisms. The exsanguination is accomplished by severing the carotid artery and the jugular vein in cattle and sheep, and the anterior vena cava in pigs.|$|E
25|$|White wine is {{regularly}} {{used as an}} ingredient. Its acidity balances well with fat taking away excess heaviness. This acidity also refines the meat or fish and it helps {{to break down the}} fibres of <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>to</b> make it tender. The role of white wine {{is similar to that of}} lemon juice used under the same conditions: once verjuice also fulfilled this function. The vinegar combines acidity with a burning sensation that gives recipes where it is used a bittersweet side characteristic.|$|E

25|$|In the Royal Navy's Arctic expeditions in the 19th century it {{was widely}} {{believed}} that scurvy was prevented by good hygiene on board ship, regular exercise, and maintaining {{the morale of the}} crew, rather than by a diet of fresh food. Navy expeditions continued to be plagued by scurvy even while fresh (not jerked or tinned) meat was well known as a practical antiscorbutic among civilian whalers and explorers in the Arctic. Even cooking fresh meat did not entirely destroy its antiscorbutic properties, especially as many cooking methods failed to bring all <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>to</b> high temperature.|$|E
25|$|Kristján Loftsson, {{owner of}} the whaling company Hvalur (Icelandic for Whale), which had had to diversify from its main {{industry}} for the preceding 20years, stated {{that there is no}} reason they can't continue hunting whales for eternity by sustainable management of the hunting. Loftsson also indicated that he planned to export <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>to</b> Japan as neither Iceland nor Japan is subject to a trade ban, although Claire Sterling of the International Fund for Animal Welfare said that Japan has officially stated {{that it would not be}} buying Icelandic whale meat. As Japan does not have any laws against importing whale meat it would not hinder such an import.|$|E
25|$|Once downed, a {{reindeer}} {{is quickly}} field dressed {{by removing the}} viscera. The skin, head, and viscera are often discarded and left for consumption by foxes, ravens, and other birds. The meat is kept cool to minimize decomposition and protected from blow-flies {{by the use of}} mesh game bags, and any fly eggs (very visible) and maggots are removed immediately. The cool climate makes it possible for <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>to</b> be kept out in the open longer than in warmer climates, therefore a hunting expedition can last several days without a serious loss of meat quality. Once home again, the meat can be hung and aged for a few days before further processing.|$|E

25|$|The broth for {{the dish}} {{can be either}} a mixture of two broths, made from beef tripe and brisket, respectively, or gomtang, a thin soup with a rich flavor made by {{simmering}} beef bones for a long time. If choosing the first type, the beef tripe and brisket have to be boiled separately because beef tripe has strong flavor that can affect the brisket broth and <b>the</b> <b>meat.</b> <b>To</b> make the beef tripe broth, cleaned beef tripe, onions, scallions, garlic, and ginger are placed {{in a large pot}} with a large amount of water and boiled until thoroughly cooked. Likewise, the brisket broth is prepared using the same method, using the same secondary ingredients to remove any bad odors that might persist. After that, both broths are chilled, and any fat floating on the surface is skimmed off. The cooked brisket is cut into bite-sized pieces, while the yang and gopchang are cut into long, diagonal strips. The boiled beef tripe and brisket are marinated with seasonings and kneaded for a long time.|$|E
500|$|Production methods {{moved from}} the {{traditional}} dry-curing process of rubbing salt, spices and sugar into the bacon to the less labour-intensive wet-curing {{process in which the}} bacon is left to soak in brine. [...] Wet curing {{can also be used to}} increase the water content of <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>to</b> add bulk and to add sodium nitrate and phosphates to shorten the process, which can then take as little as six hours compared to 2–3 days for dry curing.|$|E
500|$|A late Commentary on the Shulchan Arukh {{known as}} the Taz (Turei Zahav), on Yoreh De'ah 69:5:16, writes that the pieces of meat can be [...] "very thick" [...] when salting. The Yemenite Jewish practice, however, follows Rabbi Saadiah Gaon who {{required}} that the meat not be larger than half a [...] "rotal" [...] (i.e. ca. 216 grams) when salting. This allows {{the effects of the}} salt to penetrate. Some Orthodox Jewish communities require the additional stricture of submersing raw meat in boiling water prior to cooking it, a practice known as ḥaliṭah (...) , “blanching.” This was believed to constrict the blood lodged within <b>the</b> <b>meat,</b> <b>to</b> prevent its oozing out when it is eaten. The raw meat is left in the pot of boiling water {{for as long as it}} takes for <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>to</b> whiten on its outer layer. If someone wanted to use the water for soup after making ḥaliṭah in the same pot, he simply scoops out the film, froth and scum that surface in the boiling water. Ḥaliṭah is not required when roasting meat over a fire, as the fire constricts the blood.|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{the biblical}} {{prohibition}} of eating blood ( [...] , , [...] ), all blood must be promptly removed from the carcass.

If this procedure is not performed promptly, the blood is considered to have “set” in the meat, and the meat is no longer salvageable to eat except when prepared through broiling with appropriate drainage.|$|E
