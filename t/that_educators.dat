25|$|While {{studies have}} {{reported}} inconsistent results with regards to music's effect on memory, it has been demonstrated that music is able to interfere with various memory tasks. It has been demonstrated that new situations require new combinations of cognitive processing. This subsequently results in conscious attention being drawn to novel aspects of situations. Therefore, the loudness of music presentation along with other musical elements can assist in distracting one from normal responses by encouraging attentiveness to the musical information. Attention and recall {{have been shown to}} be negatively affected by the presence of a distraction. Wolfe (1983) cautions <b>that</b> <b>educators</b> and therapists should be made aware of the potential for environments with sounds occurring simultaneously from many sources (musical and non-musical) to distract and interfere with student learning.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of the justices held that the school principal was entitled to censor the articles. The majority opinion, written by Associate Justice Byron White, stated that officials had never intended the school paper {{to be a public}} forum, as underground publications were in past cases. White went on to say <b>that</b> <b>educators</b> do not infringe on First Amendment rights when exercising control over student speech in school-sponsored activities, [...] "so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns". The court established that the student publication could be regulated by school officials, and that they [...] "reserved the forum for its intended purpose, as a supervised learning experience for journalism students".|$|E
2500|$|Many {{opponents of}} LGBT social {{movements}} have attributed their indifference toward homosexuality {{as being a}} result of the immoral values that it may instill in children who are exposed to homosexual individuals. In opposition to this claim, many proponents of increased education about homosexuality suggest <b>that</b> <b>educators</b> should refrain from teaching about sexuality in schools entirely. In her book entitled [...] "Gay and Lesbian Movement," [...] Margaret Cruickshank provides statistical data from the Harris and Yankelovich polls which confirmed that over 80% of American adults believe that students should be educated about sexuality within their public school. In addition, the poll also found that 75% of parents believe that homosexuality and abortion {{should be included in the}} curriculum as well. An assessment conducted on California public school systems discovered that only 2% of all parents actually disapproved of their child being taught about sexuality in school.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the growing}} number of {{international}} business, military placements, and immigration there has been a growing number of TCKs. Third culture kids are being educated in a culture that is not their own. Schools and teachers {{need to be aware of}} the culture differences these students face. Studies have found <b>that</b> <b>educators</b> and counselors should be culturally competent and possess the knowledge to properly educate these type of students. This would create an effective and optimal environment for their learning and adjusting abilities. Research conducted on TCKs have [...] been found to need special attention during their transition phase. The stress and grief students feel during transitional phases can distort their psycho-social development which can affect their grades and school work. Therefore, Third Culture Kid students need a comfortable and inviting school setting to offset the effect of their transition. The best way for counselors to work with TCKs is to have sound knowledge about the students and their unique characteristics.|$|E

40|$|Social Networking Sites (SNS) {{have been}} used to support {{educational}} and professional endeavors. However, little research has been done to understand the relationship between educator identity and participation in SNS or to examine the implications that institutional regulation of such media may have upon educator identity. Using grounded theory, in this study we developed a framework for understanding how a group of teacher education students viewed their developing identities within social networking sites as they began the life transition to becoming <b>educators.</b> The theory <b>that</b> emerged from this study proposes <b>that</b> <b>educator</b> identity consists of a constellation of interconnected acceptable identity fragments, which are each intentional, authentic, transitional, necessarily incomplete, and socially-constructed and-responsive. This view of educator identity contrasts sharply with previous views of identity by highlighting the complicated, negotiated, and recursive relationship <b>that</b> exists between <b>educator</b> participation in SNS and educator identity. Additionally, this perspective suggests <b>that</b> <b>educator</b> participation in SNS is neither fully representative of authentic identity (as prominent SNS models imply) nor dramaturgical. These findings yield important implications for educators, researchers, educational institutions, lawmakers, and SNS developers alike, because they lead to a more sophisticated understanding of identity and online participation that is essential for developing mechanisms to support moral and legal judgments, professionalism, and social interactions relative to SNS. ...|$|R
