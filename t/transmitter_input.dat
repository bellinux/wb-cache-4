Recent work showed that each extraocular muscle is controlled by two motoneuronal groups: (1) Motoneurons of singly-innervated muscle fibers (SIF) that lie {{within the boundaries of}} motonuclei mediating a fast muscle contraction; and (2) motoneurons of multiply-innervated muscle fibers (MIF) in the periphery of motonuclei mediating a tonic muscle contraction. Currently only limited data about the <b>transmitter</b> <b>inputs</b> to the SIF and MIF motoneurons are available. Here we performed a quantitative study on the <b>transmitter</b> <b>inputs</b> to SIF and MIF motoneurons of individual muscles in the oculomotor and trochlear nucleus in monkey. Pre-labeled motoneurons were immunostained for GABA, glutamate decarboxylase, GABA-A receptor, glycine transporter 2, glycine receptor 1, and vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2. The main findings were: (1) the inhibitory control of SIF motoneurons for horizontal and vertical eye movements differs. Unlike in previous primate studies a considerable GABAergic input was found to all SIF motoneuronal groups, whereas a glycinergic input was confined to motoneurons of the medial rectus (MR) muscle mediating horizontal eye movements and to those of the levator palpebrae (LP) muscle elevating the upper eyelid. Whereas SIF and MIF motoneurons of individual eye muscles do not differ numerically in their GABAergic, glycinergic and vGlut 2 input, vGlut 1 containing terminals densely covered the supraoculomotor area (SOA) targeting MR MIF motoneurons.

40|$|Advancements of the {{semiconductor}} technology {{opened a new}} era in wireless communications which led manufacturers to produce faster, more functional devices in much smaller sizes. However, testing these devices of today's technology became much harder and expensive due to the complexity of the devices and the high operating speeds. Moreover, testing these devices becomes more important since decreasing feature sizes increase the probability of parametric and catastrophic faults because of the severe effects of process variations. Manufacturers have to increase their test budgets to address quality and reliability concerns. In the radio frequency (RF) domain, overall test cost are higher due to equipment costs, test development and test time costs. Advanced circuit integration, which integrates various analog and digital circuit blocks into single device, increases test costs further because of the additional tests requiring new test setups with extra test equipments. Today's RF transceiver circuits contain many analog and digital circuit blocks, such as synthesizers, data converters and the analog RF front-end leading to a mixed signal device. Verification of the specifications and functionality of each circuit block and the overall transceiver require RF instrumentation and lengthy test routines. In this dissertation, we propose efficient component and system level test methods for RF transceivers which are low cost alternatives to traditional tests. In the first component level test, we focus on in-band phase noise of the phase locked loops (PLL). Most on-chip self-test methods for PLLs aim at measuring the timing jitter that may require precise reference clocks and/or additional computation of measured specs. We propose a built in test (BiT) circuit to perform a go/no-go test for in-band PLL phase noise. The proposed circuit measures the band-limited noise power at the input of the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). This noise power is translated as the high frequency in-band phase noise at the output of the PLL. Our circuit contains a self calibration sequence based on a simple sinusoidal input signal to make it robust with respect to process variations. The second component level test is a built in self test (BiST) scheme proposed for analog to digital converters (ADC) based on a linear ramp generator and efficient output analysis. The proposed analysis method is an alternative to histogram based analysis techniques to provide test time improvements, especially when the resources are scarce. In addition to the measurement of differential nonlinearity (DNL) and integral nonlinearity (INL), non-monotonic behavior of the ADC can also be detected with the proposed technique. The proposed ramp generator has a high linearity capable of testing 13 -bit ADCs. In the proposed system level test methods, we utilize the loop-back configuration to eliminate the need for an RF instrument. The first loop-back test method, which is proposed for wafer level test of direct conversion transceivers, targets catastrophic and large parametric faults. The use of intermediate frequencies (IF) generates a frequency offset between the transmit and receive paths and prevents a direct loop-back connection. We overcome this problem by expanding the signal bandwidth through saturating the receive path composed of low noise amplifier (LNA) and mixer. Once the dynamic range of the receiver path is determined, complete transceiver can be tested for catastrophic signal path faults by observing the output signal. A frequency spectrum envelope signature technique is proposed to detect large parametric faults. The impact of impairments, such as transmitter receiver in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) gain and phase mismatches on the performance have become severe due to high operational speeds and continuous technology scaling. In the second system level loop-back test method, we present BiST solutions for quadrature modulation transceiver circuits with quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) and Gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK) baseband modulation schemes. The BiST methods use only transmitter and receiver baseband signals for test analysis. The mapping between <b>transmitter</b> <b>input</b> signals and receiver output signals are used to extract impairment and nonlinearity parameters separately with the help of signal processing methods and detailed nonlinear system modeling. The last system level test proposed in this dissertation combines the benefits of loop-back and multi-site test approaches. In this test method, we present a 2 x-site test solution for RF transceivers. We perform all operations on communication standard-compliant signal packets, thereby putting the device under the normal operating conditions. The transmitter on one device under test (DUT) is coupled with a receiver on another DUT to form a complete TX-RX path. Parameters of the two devices are decoupled from one another by carefully modeling the system into a known format and using signal processing techniques. Dissertatio...|$|E

We studied the <b>transmitter</b> <b>inputs</b> to human nIII and the trochlear nucleus (nIV), which innervates the superior oblique muscle (SO), to outline individual motoneuron subgroups. Parallel series of sections from human brainstems were immunostained for different markers: acetylcholine transferase (ChAT) combined with glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), calretinin (CR) or glycine receptor (GlyR). The cytoarchitecture was visualized with Cresyl violet, Gallyas staining and expression of non-phosphorylated neurofilaments (NP-NF). Apart from nIV, seven subgroups were delineated in nIII: the central caudal nucleus (CCN), a dorsolateral (DL), dorsomedial (DM), central (CEN), and ventral group (VEN), the nucleus of Perlia (NP) and the non-preganglionic centrally projecting Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EWcp). DL, VEN, NP and EWcp were characterized by a strong supply of GAD-positive terminals, in contrast to DM, CEN and nIV. CR-positive terminals and fibres were confined to CCN, CEN and NP. Based on location and histochemistry of the motoneuron subgroups in monkey, CEN is considered as the SR and IO motoneurons, DL and VEN as the B- and A-group of MR motoneurons, respectively, and DM as IR motoneurons. A good correlation between monkey and man is seen for the CR input, which labels only motoneurons of eye muscles participating in upgaze (SR, IO and LP).

This study provides {{a map of the}} individual subgroups of motoneurons in human nIII for the first time, and suggests that NP may contain upgaze motoneurons.
