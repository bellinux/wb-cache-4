50|$|Over the years, the Tech IV engine {{has proved}} to be a {{reliable}} workhorse for owners when not pushed to its limits. All 1978-1990 Iron Duke L-4's are outfitted with a micarta camshaft gear that meshes directly with a steel gear on the crankshaft (no timing chain), a design also used by the Chevrolet inline six. 1991-92 VIN R and U engines received a timing chain. The <b>timing</b> <b>gear</b> has a tendency to crumble a tooth anytime after 80,000 miles. The cam gear simply shears a tooth at startup and the engine won't start; because of the non-interference design of the engine, no further damage occurs. When the cam gear loses a tooth, the camshaft AND distributor stop rotating during engine cranking. Replacing the gear requires heating the new gear in hot oil and quickly installing it for a shrink(interference) fit on the cam stub. One upgrade is the use of the aluminum camshaft <b>timing</b> <b>gear</b> from a Chevrolet 250 inline six with the Iron Duke's crankshaft <b>timing</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Boarhound was {{evaluated}} alongside the Armstrong Whitworth Atlas, de Havilland Hyena and Vickers Vespa. The Jupiter's variable <b>timing</b> <b>gear</b> gave poorer power at low altitudes, a disadavantage for an army cooperation aircraft, and the Atlas was considered superior.|$|R
5000|$|A {{short block}} is an engine {{sub-assembly}} comprising {{the portion of}} the cylinder block below the head gasket but above the oil pan. An in-block cam engine includes the camshaft, <b>timing</b> <b>gear,</b> and any balance shafts. Overhead cam engines don't include those parts.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} application devised in the 1920s {{was the use}} of phenolic laminate fabric for gears; cut {{on conventional}} hobbing machines, the gears were tough and quiet, which was important for automotive <b>timing</b> <b>gears.</b> By 1932, Formica Insulation Company was producing 6,000 gear blanks per day for Chevrolet and other car makers.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} 9N {{engine was}} a four-cylinder engine and {{was designed to}} be powered by distillate fuels. The engine shares the same bore and stroke sizes as one bank of the Ford V8 automobile engines. A few standard Ford auto and truck parts, such as <b>timing</b> <b>gears</b> and valve tappets, were used in this engine.|$|E
5000|$|Another engine, {{supposedly}} {{based upon}} the Cosworth BDA and YB series engines, weighed 168 lb, half the weight of its metal counterpart. [...] Plastic parts included the engine block, cam cover, air intake trumpets, intake valve stems, piston skirts and wrist pins, connecting rods, oil scraper piston rings, tappets, valve spring retainers and <b>timing</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Mark I, US built engines {{modified}} in Britain. Modification incorporated new carburettors {{and a new}} {{induction system}} from Solex, revision of the crankcase breather, new <b>timing</b> <b>gear,</b> and revised crankshaft end thrust.

5000|$|Buda's engines were water-cooled, in-line four, six, or eight-cylinder models. Buda {{advertisements}} {{in the early}} 1900s proclaimed Buda as [...] "Pioneer of the cast-in-block" [...] method. Their engines featured long stroke, enclosed valves, noiseless <b>timing</b> <b>gears,</b> and self-contained oiling system. Early four-cylinder gasoline-fueled models produced 30 to 60 bhp. Later six-cylinder diesel Buda-Lanova engines exceeded 200 bhp.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Valve <b>timing</b> <b>gears</b> on a Ford Taunus V4 engine — {{the small}} gear {{is on the}} crankshaft, the larger gear is on the {{camshaft}}. Since the camshaft gear is twice the circumference of the crankshaft gear, it runs at half the crankshaft RPM. See gear ratio. The small gear left is on the balance shaft.|$|E
5000|$|An early {{experimental}} 200 hp Clerget V-8 {{from the}} 1910s used a sliding camshaft {{to change the}} valve timing. Some versions of the Bristol Jupiter radial engine of the early 1920s incorporated variable valve <b>timing</b> <b>gear,</b> mainly to vary the inlet valve timing in connection with higher compression ratios. [...] The Lycoming R-7755 engine had a Variable Valve Timing system consisting of two cams that can be selected by the pilot. One for take off, pursuit and escape, the other for economical cruising.|$|R
50|$|A new-generation straight-6 F-head (overhead inlet, {{side exhaust}} valve) it {{differed}} from its predecessor by having redesigned big end and main bearings using an improved alloy, improved tappets {{and a more}} efficient drive to the <b>timing</b> <b>gear.</b> Piston crowns were raised and rectangular combustion chambers provided. Externally an oil filter was mounted on the forward right hand side. Without a beam axle the engine could be mounted further forward and particular care was taken to mount it so as to minimise noise and vibration to the passengers.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s Mr G.Crookbank {{the tracks}} chief {{electrician}} had invented photoelectric <b>timing</b> <b>gear</b> that would revolutionise the sport. Hand timing {{would become a}} thing of the past after Crookbank came up with the idea that a greyhound’s race time could be recorded electronically. The invention known as 'Automatic Ray Timing' would remain as the timing method until the advent of modern computer timing. The Hackney sales became a major feature of business throughout the year, these sales became a prominent way for buying and selling greyhounds in London.|$|R
5000|$|After delaying {{introduction}} of new 16 litre engine for 2 years [...] in 2003 Volvo introduced {{one of the most}} powerful trucks ever built. The D16C engine was available in two power outputs configurations [...] and [...] and it was a completely new design similar in the lines of D9 engine introduced a couple of years earlier for FM series. The notable design changes included <b>timing</b> <b>gears</b> being on the flywheel side of the engine (rear mounted), design which allows for increased airflow around the engine, more precise injection and valve operation, noise reduction and manufacturing cost due to flywheel casing being used to house <b>timing</b> <b>gears</b> as well. In 2005 Volvo had increased the available power of D16C to [...] respectively making in it {{one of the most powerful}} production truck available.

50|$|Providers {{can also}} offer sub-divisions of auto repair insurance. There is {{standard}} repair insurance which covers the {{wear and tear}} of vehicles, and naturally occurring breakdowns. Some companies will only offer mechanical breakdown insurance, which only covers repairs necessary when breakable parts need to be fixed or replaced. These parts include transmissions, oil pumps, pistons, <b>timing</b> <b>gears,</b> flywheels, valves, axles and joints.|$|E
50|$|Production of the Model 2 {{began in}} 1947. Initial {{problems}} like noisy <b>timing</b> <b>gears</b> were remedied with special quality control measures, which included having the production foreman test and personally approve each engine {{that left the}} plant. The 1948 Model 3 DeliverCycle, a three-wheeled commercial vehicle used for parking enforcement by city police departments, was developed from the Model 2. Production of the DeliverCycle began in 1948.|$|E

5000|$|The {{straight}} six-cylinder postwar engine, {{which had}} been briefly made for the aborted by war Bentley Mark V, replaced conventional overhead valve gear with an F-head configuration of overhead inlet valves and side exhaust valves and reshaped combustion chambers. There were new main and big-end bearings and a more efficient drive to the <b>timing</b> <b>gear.</b> To this prewar mix Rolls-Royce added chromed bores. Initially, this engine retained the Mark V's capacity of [...] increased from 1951 to [...] and in 1955, after {{the introduction of the}} (standard wheelbase) Silver Cloud, to [...] for the remaining Silver Wraiths.|$|R
50|$|For the 1992 model year, the 4.3L had its {{block design}} {{modified}} {{to allow a}} balance shaft to be installed. Even though the 4.3L is an even fire V6, the 90-degree block layout is not ideal for smoothness. The balance shaft on the 4.3L is installed above the top <b>timing</b> <b>gear,</b> and runs through {{the top of the}} lifter valley. It is gear driven off the timing chain, and therefore a new timing chain cover was designed for these balanced 4.3L V6s. Balance shaft engines do not have provisions for a mechanical fuel pump unlike the non-balance shaft motors which retained the cast in boss.|$|R
