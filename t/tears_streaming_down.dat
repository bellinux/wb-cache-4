500|$|The chorus was {{inspired}} by U2's first concert in New York City following the September 11 attacks during their 2001 Elevation Tour. When the lights illuminated the audience during a performance of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name," [...] the band saw <b>tears</b> <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> the faces of many fans. Upon seeing this raw release of emotion, Bono shouted, [...] "Oh you look so beautiful tonight"; later, the band integrated the line into the chorus. The fans' passion, along with the resolve of the city following the attack, were the primary inspirations {{for many of the}} song's other lyrics.|$|E
500|$|From the 1920s {{through the}} 1950s, {{the story was}} told, re-told and likely embellished in columns by Grantland Rice, Art Carlson, Frank Blair and Dave Lewismore than one of them writing that they had seen the game in person. [...] In Carlson's 1925 account, [...] "the giant center had been {{rendered}} practically useless from the Penn attack", but refused to leave the game. [...] Carlson recalled Schulz's removal from the game this way: [...] "It was a scene I shall never forgetthe giant Schulz, towering above {{the rest of the}} combatants, literally dragged off the field, <b>tears</b> <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> his mud-spattered cheeks as he frantically protested his removal from the game".|$|E
500|$|The International Dyslexia Association {{screened}} Taare Zameen Par [...] on 29 October 2008 in Seattle, Washington. Khan {{noted in}} his official blog that there were about 200people in the audience {{and that he was}} [...] "curious to see the response of a non-Indian audience to what we had made." [...] He felt some concern that Taare Zameen Par was shown in a conference room rather than a cinema hall and was projected as a DVD rather than as a film. He said that the showing concluded to an [...] "absolutely thunderous standing ovation" [...] which [...] "overwhelmed" [...] him and that he [...] "saw the <b>tears</b> <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> the cheeks of the audience." [...] Khan also noted that the reaction to the film [...] "was exactly as it had been with audiences back home in India".|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{before the}} third {{leg of the}} Elevation Tour, the September 11 attacks {{occurred}} in New York City and Washington D.C. During the band's first show in New York City following the attacks, the band performed [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name", and when the stage lights illuminated the audience, the band saw <b>tears</b> <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> the faces of many fans. The experience was one inspiration for the song [...] "City of Blinding Lights". The band paid tribute to the 9/11 victims during their performance of the song at the Super Bowl XXXVI halftime show on 3 February 2002. The performance featured {{the names of the}} September 11 victims projected onto a large white banner behind the band, and concluded with Bono opening up his jacket to reveal the Star Spangled Banner. U2's appearance was later ranked number 1 on Sports Illustrateds list of [...] "Top 10 Super Bowl Halftime Shows".|$|E
500|$|John Pomfret of The Washington Post said a wide {{spectrum}} of Chinese and foreigners believed that Liu's award [...] "could actually resonate more deeply within China than any similar act in years". The open letter by Xu Youyu et al, which described Liu as [...] "a splendid choice" [...] because of his advancement of human rights causes and the peaceful fight against social injustice, amassed signatures from about 200 mainland intellectuals and activists; it was posted in Chinese, English, French and Japanese on websites hosted outside China. Artist and critic Ai Weiwei said that, although the regime ought to feel the most ashamed, [...] "intellectuals who had drifted away from their public responsibilities" [...] should bear some of that burden for betraying values they once strove for. Ai said that the Prize was a message from the international community to the Chinese government to respect universal human values, notwithstanding China's economic performance. Writer Liao Yiwu, a close friend of Liu, described it as [...] "a big moment in Chinese history". Another writer, Yu Jie, said he spent the night awake with <b>tears</b> <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> his face – [...] "Twenty years ago Liu Xiaobo said that China needed someone with moral clarity about what China needs. Now he has become just that person, that he himself was looking for", he said. Former Chinese diplomat Yang Hengjun described it as a strong signal to the Chinese government to speed up political reform [...] "or you will have a lot of enemies around you and within you." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the film, Jolson {{rose from}} his seat and ran down to the stage. [...] "God, I think you're really on the level about it. I feel good" [...] he cried to the audience.

2500|$|According {{to music}} historians Bruce Crowther and Mike Pinfold: [...] "During his {{time he was}} the best known and most popular {{all-around}} entertainer America (and probably the world) has ever known, captivating audiences in the theatre and becoming an attraction on records, radio, and in films. He opened the ears of white audiences to the existence of musical forms alien to their previous understanding and experience … and helped prepare the way for others who would bring a more realistic and sympathetic touch to black musical traditions." [...] Black songwriter Noble Sissle, in the 1930s, said [...] "e was always the champion of the Negro songwriter and performer, and was first to put Negroes in his shows". Of Jolson's [...] "Mammy" [...] songs, he adds, [...] "with real <b>tears</b> <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> his blackened face, he immortalized the Negro motherhood of America as no individual could." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gloria Foster died on September 29, 2001, at age 67. The {{cause of}} her death was diabetes. Though {{she was no longer}} married, her ex-husband, Clarence Williams III, was the one to {{announce}} her death. [...] A memorial was held at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn on October 15, 2001. Many of her close friends and actors and actresses who had performed with her came to attend the funeral. [...] Judith Rutherford James, a well-known producer and good friend who worked with Foster on In White America and Having Our Say played a huge part in the memorial service and helped to oversee that it ran smoothly. [...] Many of the speeches given at the service showed and spoke about how Gloria Foster not only played her part, but also embodied the character, both emotionally and physically. [...] Martin Duberman, the author of In White America, told the audience that, [...] "she embodied it. [...] At the end of the scene each night, there were <b>tears</b> <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> her face, her body was trembling, but her dignity was intact...Foster had to be covered with blankets in order to calm her shaking".|$|E

2500|$|After Goforth’s {{address the}} first morning an elder stood up before all the people and confessed to having embezzled church funds. The effect on the hearers was “instantaneous”. One person gave a [...] “piercing cry” then many, now in tears, began {{spontaneous}} prayer and confession. For three days these incidents continued. Goforth recorded, [...] "On the fourth morning an unusually large congregation had assembled. The people seemed tense, expectant… Just then the hymn ended, and I rose to speak. All through that address I was acutely conscious {{of the presence of}} God. Concluding, I said to the people: [...] "You may pray." [...] Immediately a man left his seat and, with bowed head and <b>tears</b> <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> his cheeks, came up {{to the front of the}} church and stood facing the congregation. It was the elder who, two days before, had given vent to that awful cry. As if impelled by some power quite beyond himself, he cried out: [...] "I have committed adultery. I have tried three times to poison my wife." [...] Whereupon he tore off the golden bracelets on his wrist and the gold ring from his finger and placed them on the collection plate, saying: [...] "What have I, an elder of the Church, to do with these baubles?" [...] Then he took out his elder's card, tore it into pieces and threw the fragments on the floor. [...] "You people have my cards in your homes," [...] he cried. [...] "Kindly tear them up. I have disgraced the holy office. I herewith resign my eldership." [...] For several minutes after this striking testimony no one stirred. Then, one after another, the entire session rose and tendered their resignations. The general burden of their confession was: [...] "Though we have not sinned as our brother has, yet we, too, have sinned, and are unworthy to hold the sacred office any longer." [...] Then, the deacons one by one got up and resigned from their office. [...] "We, too, are unworthy," [...] they confessed. For days I had noticed how the floor in front of the native pastor was wet with tears. He now rose and in broken tones said, [...] "It is I who am to blame. If I had been what I ought to have been, this congregation would not be where it is to day. I'm not fit to be your pastor any longer. I, too, must resign." [...] Then there followed one of the most touching scenes that I have ever witnessed. From different parts of the congregation the cry was heard: [...] "It's all right, pastor. We appoint you to be our pastor." [...] The cry was taken up until it seemed as if every one was endeavouring to tell the broken man standing there on the platform that their faith and confidence in him had been completely restored. There followed a call for the elders to stand up; and as the penitent leaders stood in their places, with their heads bowed, the spontaneous vote of confidence was repeated, [...] "Elders, we appoint you to be our elders." [...] Then came the deacons' turn. [...] "Deacons, we appoint you to be our deacons." [...] Thus were harmony and trust restored. That evening the elder whose confession had had such a marked effect was remonstrated with by one of his friends. [...] "What made you go and disgrace yourself and your family like that?" [...] he was asked. [...] "Could I help it?" [...] he replied." ...|$|E
