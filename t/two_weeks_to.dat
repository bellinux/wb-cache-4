5|$|Mei Lanfang, one of {{the most}} famous Dan {{performers}} of all time, was also {{one of the}} greatest popularizers of Peking opera abroad. During the 1920s, he performed Peking opera in Japan.

The performances had to be relocated from the 49th Street Theater to the larger National Theater, and the duration of the tour extended from <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> five. Mei traveled across the United States, receiving honorary degrees from the University of California and Pomona College. He followed this tour with a tour in the Soviet Union in 1935.|$|E
