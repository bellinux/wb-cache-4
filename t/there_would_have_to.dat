5|$|Several {{conclusions}} {{were drawn}} from discussions between Patel and the CPS, Starmer said: (a) because Patel had not retained or sampled the three litres of fluid, no firm conclusions could be drawn {{about the nature of}} it; (b) for Tomlinson's death to have resulted so quickly from blood loss, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have been a significant internal rupture; (c) Patel found no such rupture; (d) the later postmortems also found no visible rupture; and (e) because Patel was the only person to have examined Tomlinson's intact body, he was {{in the best position to}} judge the nature of the fluid, and whether there was a rupture that could have caused it. This meant that Patel's evidence would significantly undermine the evidence of the second and third pathologists.|$|E
25|$|Habitability for {{hypothetical}} planets orbiting {{brown dwarfs}} has been studied. Computer models suggesting conditions for these bodies to have habitable planets are very stringent, the habitable zone being narrow and decreasing with time, {{due to the}} cooling of the brown dwarf. The orbits <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be of extremely low eccentricity (of the order of 10−6) to avoid strong tidal forces that would trigger a greenhouse effect on the planets, rendering them uninhabitable.|$|E

Liam Fox, the Secretary of State for Defence, warned that if Trident were to be considered core funding, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be severe restrictions in the way that the UK operated militarily.|$|E

25|$|For such iron-rich {{rocks to}} be {{deposited}} <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be anoxia in the ocean, so that much dissolved iron (as ferrous oxide) could accumulate before it met an oxidant that would precipitate it as ferric oxide. For {{the ocean to}} become anoxic it must have limited gas exchange with the oxygenated atmosphere. Proponents of the hypothesis argue that the reappearance of BIF in the sedimentary record {{is a result of}} limited oxygen levels in an ocean sealed by sea-ice, while opponents suggest that the rarity of the BIF deposits may indicate that they formed in inland seas.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, it is {{theorized that}} {{contamination}} could also {{result from the}} capillary migration of deep residual hyper-saline water and hydraulic fracturing fluid, slowly flowing through faults and fractures until finally making contact with groundwater resources; however, many researchers argue that the permeability of rocks overlying shale formations are too low to allow this to ever happen sufficiently. To ultimately prove this theory, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be traces of toxic trihalomethanes (THM) since they are often associated {{with the presence of}} stray gas contamination, and typically co-occur with high halogen concentrations in hyper-saline waters. Besides, highly saline waters are a common natural feature in deep groundwater systems.|$|E

25|$|There can be {{some issues}} of undetected {{behaviors}} {{in the case of}} behaviors that many people keep secret presently or in their earlier lives. They may not be as willing to reveal behaviors that are discriminated against or stigmatized. If environment played no role in the actual behavior, skewed detection would still make it look like it played a role. For environment to appear to have no role in such cases, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be either a counterproductivity of intolerance in the sense of intolerance causing the behavior it is bigoted against, or a flaw in the study that makes the results scientifically useless.

25|$|Grant {{initially}} {{intended to}} cross the river at Grand Gulf, but the two Confederate batteries <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be eliminated before his soldiers could go ashore. Porter's gunboats attempted to do this on 29 April. Mound City and three of her sisters were assigned the task of reducing the lower battery, known as Fort Wade. Once this was accomplished, the four gunboats moved upstream to join three {{other members of the}} Mississippi River Squadron in the bombardment of the upper battery, Fort Cobun. The latter, being more favorably sited on high ground, could not be put out of action. One man was killed on Mound City, the only casualty the ship suffered during the gunfight. At the end of the day, Fort Cobun had only a single gun still operational, but it was sufficient to cause Grant to decide not to make his river crossing at Grand Gulf. He continued down the river and made an unopposed landing at Bruinsburg, Mississippi.|$|E

500|$|The {{subject of}} {{aperiodic}} tilings received {{new interest in}} the 1960s when logician Hao Wang noted connections between decision problems and tilings. In particular, he introduced tilings by square plates with colored edges, now known as Wang dominoes or tiles, and posed the [...] "Domino Problem": {{to determine whether a}} given set of Wang dominoes could tile the plane with matching colors on adjacent domino edges. He observed that if this problem were undecidable, then <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> exist an aperiodic set of Wang dominoes. At the time, this seemed implausible, so Wang conjectured no such set could exist.|$|E

It was decided that the service should take 19 minutes—and not one minute more.

500|$|Several {{biographies of}} Hans-Joachim Marseille {{have written about}} his disdain for {{authority}} and for the National Socialist movement in general. Some biographers describe him as [...] "openly anti-Nazi." [...] When Marseille first met Hitler in 1942 he did not form a positive impression. After returning to Africa, Eduard Neumman recalled, [...] "After his first visit with Hitler, Marseille returned {{and said that he}} thought 'the Führer was a rather odd sort'." [...] On the visit, Marseille also said some unflattering things about Hitler and the Nazi Party. Several senior officers, which included Adolf Galland and Nicolaus von Below, overheard his remarks during one of the award ceremonies. Von Below asked Marseille if he would join the Nazi Party and within earshot of others, Marseille responded, [...] "that if he saw a party worth joining, he would consider it, but <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> plenty of attractive women in it."

500|$|Under Bruce the Australian {{government}} also moved {{to its new}} permanent home in the planned federal city of Canberra. Plans for a new federal capital had been circulated {{since the time of}} Federation, and a site on the Molonglo River was selected in 1913. Design and construction had proceeded slowly due to World War I as well as funding and management problems. Bruce was a committed advocate of the new capital, however, stating: [...] "For the purposes of Federation it was essential that there should be some central point of nationhood, suitable to Australia as a nation... and sooner or later <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be a national capital, overriding State boundaries and State prejudices." [...] This came to pass on 9 May 1927 when the Federal Parliament moved to its new premises in Canberra; Bruce had moved himself and his wife to The Lodge a few days earlier. At the Federal Parliament's opening ceremony, Bruce decided that voices of the clerks of the House of Representatives and the Senate were too heavily accented, and determined that he would personally welcome the Duke of York and co-open the new building a move that was criticised by several parliamentarians. The business of transferring government and cabinet operations to the new capital proceeded slowly over 1927 and 1928. This was an administrative task that occupied a significant proportion of the government's time in those years, with many departments only very gradually transferring from Melbourne, much to Bruce's consternation.|$|E

That same day, Tsvetanov denied media reports that it was a local Hezbollah cell, saying that the possibility was not discussed.

This was found simply to mean [...] "requiring considerable management time and effort".
