40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the use of an}} indirectly heated, high temperature (900 ºC), high vacuum (28 " Hg) rotary kiln, developed and patented by Raduce, Inc. (subsidiary of Sepradyne Corp.), to treat a dioxin contaminated mixed waste incinerator ash from the Idaho National Engineering Lab (INEEL) Waste Experimental Reduction Facility (WERF). The Raduce process differs from conventional thermal processing systems (e. g., direct-fired incinerators and indirect heated <b>thermal</b> <b>desorption</b> <b>units)</b> primarily due to the combination of a high vacuum and rotary mixing action achieved by means of a proprietary rotating vacuum seal. Treatment {{in the absence of an}} oxidative environment distinguishes the technology from conventional techniques and eliminates products of incomplete combustion. A 500 cm 3 bench-scale rotary vacuum <b>thermal</b> <b>desorption</b> and destruction <b>unit</b> (DDU) was used at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) to demonstrate this thermal treatment process. Dioxins and furans were successfully decomposed at both low (450 ºC) and high (700 - 800 ºC) temperature regimes. Dioxin homologue concentrations in the untreated ash ranged between 30 and 565 ppb and furan homologue concentrations ranged between 78 and 267 ppb. After thermal treatment, dioxin/furan homologue concentrations were close to non-detectable (the highest dioxin concentration was reported at 0. 067 ppb and the highest furan concentration was 0. 119 ppb) for samples treated at both 450 ºC and 750 ºC. In addition, substantial volume and mass reduction of the ash was achieved. Stabilization of the nonvolatile residues by a post-treatment encapsulation process will be required to reduce the leachability of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) metals to levels below the EPA Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) requirements...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a recent {{increase}} {{in the amount of}} oil and natural gas exploration due to fuel reserves that were once inaccessible in North America becoming available through methods such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. However, these methods of exploration generate substantial amounts of oil contaminated waste which pose significant pollution risks of which current methods of treatment are slow and ineffective. This project aims to design a better operating process for use with Anaerobic <b>Thermal</b> <b>Desorption</b> <b>Units</b> (ATDU) that are currently manufactured by RLC Technologies which offer more environmentally safe and quick processing of such wastes. Current methods used to treat oil contaminated waste include land farming and deep well injection. These methods in essence leave the oils on or in the ground that has raised concern regarding land and groundwater pollution. These methods are practiced due their lack of regulation and little cost investment. RLC provides a waste treatment service that is currently more cost efficient {{than the rest of the}} current market for <b>thermal</b> <b>desorption</b> plants. Through success of this project, a more cost effective method can be offered by RLC Technologies that can be competitive with the current regulation light methods in practice. The focus of the project is on aiding RLC in the utilization of their ATDU for their plant operations. In order to do so, the team will study the effects of drum rotation speed, temperature, and waste composition on waste materials from drill cuttings and (remove!) synthetically created waste on a bench and pilot scale sized batch ATDU. The data collected will be used for determining the thermal efficiency by analyzing how much of the base oils are collected. The desired outcomes are to improve the oil recovery of the current ADTU capabilities by at least ten percent while reducing costs associated with it’s operation. There will be efforts to increase the amounts of the diesel ranged oils in the recovered product through controlling the thermal cracking in the ADTU. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) for the enrichment of pesticides from vegetables, fruits and baby food samples is discussed. After extraction with methanol, an aliquot is diluted {{with water and}} SBSE is performed for 60 min.

The presence of pesticide residues is elucidated with the retention time locked gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy method (RTL-capillary GC-MS). With SBSE-RTL-capillary GC-MS operated in the scan mode, more than 300 pesticides can be monitored in vegetables, fruits and baby food.

Considerable research has been devoted towards determining the kinetics of the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass such as wood residues and agricultural waste. In this study, we have developed a finite element model (FEM) in order to simulate the coupled heat and mass transfer phenomena during pyrolysis. The resulting sets of partial differential equations were then solved simultaneously using the COMSOL Multiphisics software package.

40|$|An in-situ {{derivatization}} {{thermal desorption}} method followed by gas chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (IDTD-GC-TOFMS) {{was developed for}} determination of polar organic compounds. Hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of compounds such as anhydrous sugars, alcohols and phenols, fatty acids and resin acids are targets of the derivatization procedure. Derivatization is based on silylation with N-Methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) during the step of thermal desorption. The high temperature of 300 &deg;C during desorption is utilized for the in-situ derivatization on the collection substrate (quartz fibre filters) accelerating the reaction rate. Thereby, the analysis time is as short as without derivatization. At first the filter surface is dampened with derivatization reagent before insertion of the sample into the <b>thermal</b> <b>desorption</b> <b>unit.</b> To ensure ongoing derivatization during thermal desorption the carrier gas is saturated with MSTFA until the desorption procedure is finished.
