40|$|The apple is {{the most}} {{ubiquitous}} of temperate fruits and has been cultivated in Europe and Asia from antiquity. It was known to the Greeks and Romans and mentioned by Theophrastus in the third century B. C. Since then the apple has been distributed into almost {{all parts of the}} world. The genetic variability found in the apple has allowed adapted types to be selected for different environments, and selection continues for new types to extend apple culture into both colder and warmer regions. Orchards are now found in Siberia and northern China where winter temperatures fall to – 40 °C and in high elevations in Colombia and Indonesia straddling the equator where two crops can be produced in a single year (Janick 1974).

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of studying the effect of using <b>table</b> salt, <b>apple</b> juice and citric acid on quality parameters of aerated dough and bread prepared by mechanical leavening. The wholegrain flour from chickpea seeds has been used to prepare dough. The amount of salt is in the range from 1 to 3 %, apple juice from 5 to 25 %, citric acid 0. 05 to 0. 2 % over the weight of the flour. The working mechanism of recipe components on the process of foaming while kneading of the semi-finished products of chickpea flour has been identified. The increase of their amount leads to increase of active acidity of the test and brings the protein pH to isoelectric point. Thus increasing the foaming capacity of the albuminous substances while kneading the semis. It has been founded that the maximum foaming capacity of the semis is achieved at pH 5. 5. At the same time a decrease in the bulk density of the dough and the increase in specific volume of the baked product. In this case, the samples are characterized by lower bulk density (0. 32 g / cm 3), and maximum specific volume of finished product (365 cm 3 / 100 g).

40|$|Sensory {{experience}} {{seems to}} be the basis of our knowledge and conception of mind-independent things. The puzzle is to understand how that can be: even if the things we experience (<b>apples,</b> <b>tables,</b> trees etc), are mind-independent how does our sensory experience of them enable us to conceive of them as mind-independent? George Berkeley thought that sensory experience can only provide us with the conception of mind-dependent things, things which cannot exist when they aren't being perceived. It's easy to dismiss Berkeley's conclusion but harder to see how to avoid it. In this book, John Campbell and Quassim Cassam propose very different solutions to Berkeley's Puzzle. For Campbell, sensory experience can be the basis of our knowledge of mind-independent things because it is a relation, more primitive than thought, between the perceiver and high-level objects and properties in the mind-independent world. Cassam opposes this 'relationalist' solution to the Puzzle and defends a 'representationalist' solution: sensory experience can give us the conception of mind-independent things because it represents its objects as mind-independent, but does so without presupposing concepts of mind-independent things. This book is written {{in the form of a}} debate between two rival approaches to understanding the relationship between concepts and sensory experience. Although Berkeley's Puzzle frames the debate, the questions addressed by Campbell and Cassam aren't just of historical interest. They are among the most fundamental questions in philosophy...|$|R
5000|$|Upon arrival {{the guests}} found all three granary {{buildings}} decorated with evergreens, flags, banners, and bunting. Lawson used the largest room, with seating arrangements for over one thousand guests {{for music and}} dancing; assigning the two smaller rooms, each with a seating capacity for 400 guests, for lectures and the serving of refreshments. The formalities began with James Burns, the celebrated London gymnast reciting an amusing sketch entitled, ‘How to read a man like a book’. At noon Lawson served a ‘fruit, grain, and vegetable meal’, consisting of raw turnip, boiled cabbage, boiled wheat, boiled barley, shelled peas, oatmeal gruel, boiled horse beans and boiled potatoes. He also presented a salad, made from chopped carrot, turnip, cabbage, parsley and celery, served with a congealed sauce made from boiled linseed. There were no condiments and since everything was cold except the potatoes, one can only imagine the guest's apprehension, as they sat down to dinner. To compensate for the poorly prepared meal each guest upon rising from the <b>table</b> received an <b>apple</b> and a biscuit. The {{total cost of the}} ingredients was less than £8. The entertainment continued in the afternoon with a colourful concert comprising gymnastic displays, music, songs and speeches. During the afternoon, the two [...] steam engines set off with whistles screaming to lead a procession through the farm. Around five in the afternoon guests received an ‘evening meal’, followed by a lecture entitled, ‘Diet and the Health of the Human Body’. However unpalatable these proceedings may appear today the guests appreciated the proceedings. The problems arose from lack of experience, a shortage of cooking facilities, and from Lawson's insistence that the food comprise a truly national flavour, thus excluding rice, raisins, currants, pepper, sugar, salt and other readily available imports. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, public opinion suggested that the lectures and experiments were ample compensation for the dissatisfaction caused by the bland food. The second festival was equally successful, and although Lawson levied a small charge for food, he did provide bread and beef. Lawson hailed the third festival as a Social Science Congress, with a series of lectures covering a wide variety of scientific topics. Again, food was free and although beef and ham were available, the meal consisted in the main of rice boiled with currants and raisons. On this occasion, the application for free tickets was so immediate and numerous that after receiving almost 3,000 requests he closed the offer on December 3, Although ruined by rain, observers recalled two novel events, labourers using Cain’s boiler to heat the water to mash tea, and an attempt by Lawson to introduce a non-smoking policy. In total, Lawson sponsored five festivals, the first four on consecutive Christmas days, while the fifth celebration took place in July, in a meadow adjoining the River Ellen.|$|R
40|$|Neben dem Verzehr von Obst und Gemüse wird auch Fruchtsäften eine Bedeutung für die Prävention chronisch entzündlicher Darmerkrankungen und Dickdarmkrebs beigemessen. Neben der direkten antioxidativen Kapazität polyphenolischer Inhaltstoffe spielt vermutlich auch deren Einfluss auf die Expression redoxsensitiver Gene, wie z. B. der gamma-Glutamylcystein-Ligase (g-GCL) eine protektive Rolle. Die {{in-vitro}} Arbeiten an den Kolontumorzelllinien verfolgten das Ziel die antioxidative Wirksamkeit verschiedener Apfelsaftextrakte zu charakterisieren. Hierbei wurde der Einfluss der Aglyka Quercetin und Phloretin, der Inhaltsstoffe Chlorogensäure und Kaffeesäure, sowie der Apfelsaftextrakte AE 02 / 03 und AE 05 auf die Transkription redoxsensitiver Zielgene in HT- 29 und Caco- 2 Zellen nach 6 - und 24 h-Inkubation mittels Real Time TaqMan PCR untersucht. Als Referenzverbindungen wurden Sulforaphan und Menadion eingesetzt. Die für den Glutathion-Redoxstatus relevanten ARE-abhängigen Gene GPX 2 und GSR, sowie die Nrf 2 Genexpression wurden in die Untersuchungen miteinbezogen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen u. a. charakteristische, zellspezifische Unterschiede in der Modulation der antioxidativen Genexpression, bei der sich die HT- 29 Zellen vor allem im Hinblick auf die gewählte Inkubationszeit und Konzentration der untersuchten Testmaterialien als sensitiver erwiesen. Ein weiteres Ziel dieser Arbeit war die Charakterisierung eines polyphenolreichen Smoothies im Hinblick auf Bioverfügbarkeit und antioxidative Wirksamkeit im menschlichen Darm. Die Interventionsstudie mit Ileostoma-Patienten ermöglichte es, Saftinhaltstoffe und Metabolite eines Smoothiees der Apfelsorte Winesap unmittelbar vor der Dickdarmpassage aus den Inhalten der Ileostomabeutel zu gewinnen und in-vitro auf antioxidative Wirksamkeit hin zu überprüfen. Hierbei konnten sowohl zellfrei (TEAC und ORAC Assay) als auch mit der humanen Kolonkarzinomzellinie HT 29 ein antioxidatives Potenzial der Ileostoma-Beutelinhalte nachgewiesen werden. Die TEAC- und ORAC-Werte der Ileostoma-Proben zeigten einen deutlichen Anstieg mit einem Maximum bei 4 h nach Saftverzehr. Im Vergleich zu den 0 h- Ileostombeutel-Inhalten bewirkten die 2 h- und 4 h-Ileostoma-Beutelinhalte eine signifikanten Reduktion des TBH-induzierten ROS-Levels (DCF-Assay) nach 24 h Inkubation in HT 29 -Zellen. Die Identifizierung als auch die quantitative Erfassung der in den Ileostoma-Proben enthaltenen polyphenolischen Inhaltsstoffe, sowie deren Abbauprodukte könnte Hinweise auf aktivitätsgeleitete Strukturen einzelner polyphenolischer Verbindungen geben. In einer Interventionsstudie an Ratten wurde der Einfluss unterschiedlich hergestellter Apfelsäfte (klarer/ trüber AS, Smoothie, im Vergleich zu einem polyphenolfreien Kontrollsaft) auf die Modulation ARE abhängiger Genexpression in Kolon und Leber männlicher SD-Ratten mittels duplex RT-PCR untersucht. Die aus der vorliegenden Interventionsstudie an Ratten gewonnen Ergebnisse, weisen auf eine Erhöhung der antioxidativen Abwehr durch polyphenolische Apfelsäfte hin. Die Induktion der redoxsensitiven Genexpression variierte hierbei in ihrer Stärke je nach Zielgewebe (Kolon > Leber) und Art des Saftes (trüber > klarer ~ Smoothie). Ergänzend zu den von Spormann et al. untersuchten Biomarkern wurden Genexpressionsuntersuchungen aus PBMCs von Hämodialyse-Patienten mittels Real Time TaqMan PCR durchgeführt. Hierbei wurde neben der Expression ausgewählter glutathionbezogener Gene (g-GCL, GPX 1, GSR) auch die Nrf 2 Transkription, sowie die Genexpression des inflammatorischen Enzyms COX- 2 erfasst. Im Vergleich zur Woche 1 der run-in Phase zeigt sich nach Intervention mit rotem Mehrfruchtsaft ein deutlicher Anstieg der mRNA Expression in den meisten antioxidativen Zielgenen, die COX- 2 Genexpression wurde dagegen während der Saftaufnahme leicht herunterreguliert. The risk {{of cancer}} and other degenerative diseases is inversely correlated with consumption of fruits and vegetables. This beneficial effect is mainly attributed to secondary plant constituents such as polyphenols, supposed {{to play a major}} role in protection against ROS (reactive oxygen species) associated toxicity. In addition to the direct antioxidative capacity of polyphenols, modulation of redox-sensitive gene expression, such as of gamma-glutamate-cysteine ligase (g-GCL), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of glutathione synthesis, is of particular interest. Inter alia we investigated the modulation of antioxidant response element (ARE) - dependent genes (g-GCL: catalytic and modulatory subunits, glutathione peroxidase 2 : GPX 2, glutathione reductase: GSR and erythroid-derived 2 -like 2 : Nrf 2) by phenolic juice extracts from <b>table</b> and cider <b>apple</b> varieties (AE 02, AE 03), known to elevate the glutathione level in HT- 29 and Caco- 2 cells. The aglyca quercetin (Qu) and phloretin (Ph), the constituents rutin (Ru), chlorogenic acid (ChA), caffeic acid (CA) and two known inducers of g-GCL (menadione, Mn; sulforaphane, Sul), were also studied. mRNA levels were quantified by Real Time TaqMan PCR after 6 and 24 h incubation. In conclusion, modulation of gene expression by aglyca, rutin and AEs varied with cell type and structure of the compounds: Qu and AE 03 (rich in quercetin glycosides) are most effective, elevating g-GCL transcription. A relation between g-GCL transcription and glutathione level was partially observed, e. g. with Qu and AE 03 (both effective in Caco- 2 cells) and AE 02 (not effective in HT- 29 cells). The results obtained with Su and Mn in HT- 29 cells showed similar patterns for the ARE- dependent genes g-GCL, GPX 2 and GSR. In an intervention study, 10 healthy probands with terminal ileostomy consumed 0. 7 L of a pulp enriched apple juice (Smoothie) and the ileostomy bags were collected at different time points (before juice consumption (0 h) and after intervention: 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h and 8 h). The aim of the study was to characterize the antioxidative effectiveness of the lyophilized ileostomy bag contents in-vitro after fermentation of the polyphenol-rich Smoothie in-vivo. The results show a distinct cell free antioxidant activity (TEAC and ORAC Assay) of the lyophilized samples, exhibiting a maximum by the samples at 4 h after juice intervention. The tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH) induced reactive oxygen (ROS) -level (DCF-Assay) was significantly decreased in the HT- 29 cell line by the 2 h and 4 h lyophilisate samples. Further, we studied the potential of differently manufactured apple juices (clear AJ/ cloudy AJ/ smoothie, in comparison to a polyphenol free control juice) to modulate expression of antioxidant response element (ARE) -dependent genes in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Expression of target genes (superoxide dismutase, SOD 1 / SOD 2; GPX 1 / GPX 2; g-GCL; GSR; catalase, CAT; NAD(P) H quinone oxidoreductase 1, NQO 1 and transcription factor Nrf 2, was quantified with duplex RT-PCR, using glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as endogenous control. In colon and liver of rats consuming polyphenol-free control juice, rather similar basic expressions were observed (relative GAPDH ratios ranging from 2 - 0. 7 and 2. 5 - 0. 3, respectively). In the distal colon, apple juice intervention slightly but significantly induced most genes (e. g. GPX 2, GSR, CAT, Nrf 2; p clear AJ ~ smoothie). Taken together, the results underline the potential of polyphenol rich apple juice to increase the expression of ARE dependent antioxidant genes. Uptake of fruit juice with especially high flavonoid/polyphenol content has been shown to reduce oxidative cell damage in healthy probands (Weisel et al. 2006) and might also be utilized as preventive measure in hemodialysis (HD) -patients. An intervention study with patients on hemodialysis was performed by Spormann et al. with mixed fruit juice (Spormann et al. 2008) and from blood samples of 10 HD-patients of the aforementioned study we investigated the modulation of ARE dependent (g-GCL, GPX 1, GSR, Nrf 2), as well as inflammatory (Cyclooxygenase- 2, Cox- 2) gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). During the juice intervention phase a distinct increase in expression of most antioxidant genes was observed, whereas expression of the inflammatory Cox- 2 gene was moderately down regulated. In conclusion, the red fruit juice clearly shows a marked potential to elevate antioxidant gene expression in HD-patients...|$|R
