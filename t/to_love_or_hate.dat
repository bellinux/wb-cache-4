60|$|The Press is {{the second}} great factor to which critics of {{capitalism}} point when they wish to prove that capitalism {{is the source of}} modern war. Since the running of a big newspaper requires a large capital, the proprietors of important organs necessarily belong to the capitalist class, {{and it will be a}} rare and exceptional event if they do not sympathize with their own class in opinion and outlook. They are able to decide what news the great mass of newspaper readers shall be allowed to have. They can actually falsify the news, or, without going so far as that, they can carefully select it, giving such items as will stimulate the passions which they desire to stimulate, and suppressing such items as would provide the antidote. In this way the picture of the world in the mind of the average newspaper reader is made to be not a true picture, but in the main that which suits the interests of capitalists. This is true in many directions, but above all in what con- cerns the relations between nations. The mass of the population of a country can be led <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>or</b> <b>hate</b> any other country at the will of the newspaper proprietors, which is often, directly or indirectly, influenced by the will of the great financiers. So long as enmity between England and Russia was desired, our newspapers were full of the cruel treatment meted out to Russian political prisoners, the oppression of Finland and Russian Poland, and other such topics. As soon as our foreign policy changed, these items disappeared from the more important newspapers, and we heard instead of the misdeeds of Germany. Most men are not sufficiently critical to be on their guard against such influences, and until they are, the power of the Press will remain.|$|E

And I doubt not that he speaks honestly. But (I quote with all reverence) though the spirit be willing, the flesh is weak. Studies which {{have to do with}} man's history, man's thoughts, man's feelings, are too exciting, too personal, often, alas, too tragical, to allow us to read them calmly at first. The men and women of whom we read are so like {{ourselves}} (for the human heart is the same in every age), that we unconsciously begin <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>or</b> <b>hate</b> them in the first five minutes, and read history as we do a novel, hurrying on to see when the supposed hero and heroine get safely married, and the supposed villain safely hanged, {{at the end of the}} chapter, having forgotten all the while, in our haste, to ascertain which is the hero and which is the villain. Mary Queen of Scots was [...] "beautiful and unfortunate"--what heart would not bleed for a beautiful woman in trouble? Why stop to ask whether she brought it on herself? She was seventeen years in prison. Why stop to ascertain what sort of a prison it was? And as for her guilt, the famous Casket Letters were, of course, a vile forgery. Impossible that they could be true. Hoot down the cold-hearted, and disagreeable, and troublesome man of facts, who will persist in his stupid attempt to disenchant you, and repeat--But the Casket Letters were not a forgery, and we can prove it, if you will but listen to the facts. Her prison, as we will show you (if you will be patient and listen to facts), consisted in greater pomp and luxury than that of most noblemen, with horses, hounds, books, music, liberty to hunt and amuse herself in every way, even in intriguing with every court of Europe, as we can show you again, if you will be patient and listen to facts. And she herself was a very wicked and false woman, an adulteress and a murderess (though fearfully ill-trained in early youth), who sowed the wind, poor wretch, from girlhood to old age, and therefore reaped the whirlwind, receiving the just reward of her deeds. Catherine of Russia, meanwhile, instead of being beautiful and unfortunate, was only handsome and successful. Brand her as a disgrace to human nature. The morals and ways of the two were pretty much on a par, with these exceptions in Catherine's favour-- that she had strong passions, Mary none; that she lived in outer darkness and practical heathendom, while Mary had the light shining all round her, and refused it deliberately again and again. What matter to the sentimentalist? Hiss the stupid hard-hearted man of facts, by all means. What if he be right? He has no business to be right; we will consider him wrong accordingly, of our own sovereign will and pleasure. For after all, if we had the facts put before us (says the conscience of many a hearer), we could not judge of them; we read to be amused and instructed, not to study cases like so many barristers. So is history read. And so, alas, is history written, too often, for want of a steady and severe training which would enable people to judge dispassionately of facts. In politics the case is the same. In poetry, which appeals more directly to the feelings, it must needs be still worse; as has been shown sadly enough of late by the success of several poems, in which every possible form of bad taste has only met with unbounded admiration from the many who have not had their senses exercised to discern between good and evil.|$|E

40|$|Heracleum persicum was {{introduced}} to Norway as an ornamental in the 1830 ′s. Towards {{the end of the}} 19 th century, it started spreading outside gardens, later to become a frequent sight in the major towns and settlements of North Norway – and a veritable pest plant. During the last 100 years or so, a substantial ethnobotanical tradition related to the species has evolved, demonstrating that folk knowledge is not only forgotten and lost, but also charting new terrain. This survey is based on data extracted from all relevant publications, including botanical literature, travel accounts, newspaper notes, etc., as far as they have come to my attention. In addition, information on vernacular names and various uses of the H. persicum in Norway has been extracted from my own, substantial archive of interviews, questionnaires, and correspondence related to the ethnobotany of Norway. Where extant, H. persicum tends to be known to everyone, even by city dwellers who otherwise generally neglect plants. People tend <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>or</b> <b>hate</b> it, and in Tromsø, the largest town of northern Norway, the species has become more or less emblematic of the city. Both here and in other areas of northern Norway, it is referred to by a variety of vernacular names, partly borrowed from other species, partly derived from the Latin genus name, and partly coined for this species only. In the latter group, tromsøpalme (‘the palm of Tromsø’) has proved by far the most popular invention. It was seemingly first used (and coined) by German soldiers during the World War II occupation of Norway, but now largely replaces other vernacular names. The plant is still popular with children, who frequently play in and with it, whereas adults have been more prone to speculate on its origins – and how to get rid of it. Salt is the most popular “herbicide” for this purpose. Over the years, H. persicum has accumulated at least twenty different vernacular names in Norway, {{and a variety of other}} traditions. By necessity, all these traditions are less than 180 years old, showing that even modern and urban societies may produce a substantial body of plant lore, which certainly merits ethnobotanical attention...|$|E
40|$|Kevin Rudd 2 ̆ 7 s lead in {{the polls}} {{is not hard to}} understand, writes DAVID BURCHELL RECENTLY the {{political}} commentator Robert Manne was musing over the remarkable political rise of Kevin Rudd. He noted the sudden and striking turnaround in the polling figures since Rudd’s ascension to the Labor leadership. “No one knows why it has happened,” he observed, in puzzled tones. And “no one knows whether this kind of polling will last. ” For Manne the electorate appeared like a kind of Delphic oracle, mysterious yet omnipotent. Manne is not alone. Commentators of all persuasions have been exceedingly slow to take the polling figures of the last ten months seriously. Even lifelong pollsters like Sol Lebovic have been suspicious of them, as if the polls were a strange species of poisonous snake that might snap around to bite them. Senior members of the government, meanwhile, have appeared palpably stunned by the turnaround, and have begun to talk as if the electorate were an ungrateful teenager, who fails to understand all the good that has been done for it. Tony Abbott’s parental frustration has been particularly ill-hidden. (My daughter, watching him on TV, recognised it right away.) At one level this bewilderment probably says something about the persistently mysterious character of representative democracy. We all believe somewhere in our minds in the sovereignty of the Australian people over the electoral process. Yet since - unlike the citizens of ancient Athens - the people don’t meet together in some appointed place to make their decisions, commentators and politicians alike are forced to second-guess what “they” really think. And they develop elaborate theories about public attitudes which often amount to little more than educated intuition. Most of the time this strange beast called public opinion seems to scuttle about fairly harmlessly, moving its location only by easily-trackable degrees. From time to time, though, public opinion turns skittish. And then commentators turn into self-imagined wildlife-handlers, attempting to talk the public back onto some more predictable path. On the face of it, though, there’s nothing especially mysterious about the shift in the political atmosphere since December last year. It’s merely that the commentariat - as is so often the case - was so immersed in its own particular mental universe that it failed to notice what was going on. Ever since the 1998 election Labor lacked credibility as an alternative government. Neither Kim Beazley nor Simon Crean commanded conviction as alternative prime ministers. Nor did Labor over that period have much to say that was new and relevant {{in the context of a}} thriving, dynamic society. Mark Latham woke voters up, and suggested new policy themes for Labor’s future. But the brushstrokes were never filled in, and the electorate rightly sensed a troubling volatility about a leader elevated far too early in his career. The initial polling response to Kevin Rudd is perhaps best understood in this context as a collective electoral sigh of relief. At last there was an alternative government worth considering. All the better, given that the incumbents had been in power so long, and were starting to behave like a comfortable regime. Commentators have been inclined to pooh-pooh Rudd’s insistence on the government’s longevity and the PM’s age. On the whole they’ve agreed with Tony Abbott: you should judge a government not by its age, but by its deeds. But the fear that ageing governments will turn sclerotic is a venerable and healthy democratic instinct. Given enough time, even the most democratically-inclined individuals tend to believe themselves destined to rule forever. The mere fact that so many in the government believe they deserve to win this election on their past record alone is testimony to this familiar political cancer. Nor is this new. By the early 1990 s many Labor ministers similarly had come to believe that Labor governments were henceforth to be Australia’s manifest destiny. On the account of a senior staffer of the time, one ex-minister was so devastated and uncomprehending about the 1996 defeat that for two years afterwards he kept attempting to issue policy announcements, like a defeated general moving phantom divisions around on a table-top. The same sadly humorous story may well recur after November. However, there’s probably also another, more shadowy, aspect to this widespread incomprehension over the electorate’s skittishness. Commentators of all persuasions have taken to their hearts the belief that “the Howard years” have made a lasting impact on the mood of the nation. The PM’s critics in the intelligentsia love to imagine him as a kind of diabolical Rasputin figure, mesmerising the electorate by appealing to the dark side of the collective unconscious. (That’s especially gratifying if you believe yourself to one of the few not taken in.) His supporters like to imagine Mr Howard connecting with Middle Australia as if through a political umbilical cord. Yet in truth most Australians feel much less strongly about the PM than do members of either commentary camp. Most people don’t feel the need either <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>or</b> <b>hate</b> their political leaders. On the whole they merely give them grudging respect: after all, it keeps them on their toes. John Howard has been a competent and conscientious PM, and an effective communicator of conservative political nostrums. His greatest skill, perhaps, lies in pointing out the delusions and shortcomings of his political opponents. That doesn’t mean, though - as it’s so often taken to mean - that he’s somehow managed to shift the basic attitudinal makeup of the majority of Australians. Broadly speaking, there are no more conservatives in Australia than there were eleven years ago. Nor, despite all the intellectual brouhouha about affluence, selfishness and “gated communities,” are Australians obviously less concerned for each others’ welfare than they were back in 1996. Or, to cut a long story short: believe the polls. The electorate does change its mind. And the government is in terminal trouble. • David Burchell teaches in Humanities at the University of Western Sydney, and is associate editor of APO. Photo: AAP Image/Alan Porrit...|$|E

We don't have any interest in being this week's flavor of the month; we don't want to be a band that's just recognized by journalists and other musicians." ...|$|R
