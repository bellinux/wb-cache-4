After Brendan attempts <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> about the pH balance of the soil, Tracey sharply comments that gardening is more about respect for nature than scientific theory. Otherwise, though, he doesn't betray his more sinister intent towards Brendan. Later that night, he sends his son out to kidnap the sleeping Brendan from the house.|$|E
25|$|Rhonda Lee (Leslie Easterbrook) is a tall, voluptuous, {{somewhat}} ditzy blonde actress/singer/dancer/model {{trying to}} get discovered and make it big in Hollywood. She is Laverne and Shirley's neighbor and a regular character after they move to Burbank. Rhonda, who also comes off as rather narcissistic about her good looks and self-obsessed, usually (always?) refers to herself in the third person, by her first name. Rhonda often bursts into Laverne and Shirley's apartment (occasionally at inopportune times, much like Lenny and Squiggy often do) to borrow things without really asking and <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> about her social engagements or romantic dates with desirable men {{with the intention of}} making the girls envious.|$|E

I want my children to say, 'Daddy really said something, he wasn't just trying <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> on himself.'" [...] Many songs on ATLiens feature more unconventional subject matter for hip hop. [...] The lyrical content ranges from addressing urban life as hustlers and pimps to extraterrestrial life and space travel. The title track's chorus expresses Southern pride, while its verses feature André 3000 explaining his newly adopted drug-free lifestyle.|$|E

[...] Dixon felt that the lyrics expressed part of the audience's unfulfilled desire <b>to</b> <b>brag,</b> while Waters later admitted that they were supposed to have a comic effect. [...] Music historian Ted Gioia points to the underlying theme of sexuality and virility as sociologically significant. [...] He sees it as challenge to the fear of miscegenation in the dying days of racial segregation in the United States. [...] Record producer Marshall Chess took a simpler view: [...] "It was sex.

Immediately afterwards, Meg enters her home, and begs her parents to get buy her a new vehicle. Reluctant to do so, Peter informs Meg that plenty of people are able to get around without a car, including the fictional Marvel Comics superhero Iceman.

2500|$|Andriantsimitoviaminandriandehibe {{pledged to}} {{continue}} his father's work to transform the Bestimitatatra swamps into rice paddies to feed the growing population of Imerina. He selected two of his sons to oversee the labor. The two princes challenged one another to see who could complete their dike fastest. The king proceeded to traditionally divide the territory into northern and southern halves along the Ikopa River and assigned Andrianjakanavalondambo to construct a southern dike at Ambivy, while his eldest son and heir apparent, Razakatsitakatrandriana, was tasked with building a northern dike from Ankadimbahovaka to Anosizato. The king positioned himself at Ankadimbahovaka where he could observe {{the work of the}} entire population and both his sons' qualities of governance as they oversaw the construction of the dikes. The younger of the two boys, Andrianjakanavalondambo, was the first to complete the construction of his dike.

2500|$|Besides {{the added}} {{incentive}} of no longer depleting the finances with expensive wars with Hatti {{and increasing the}} security of Egypt's claims in Syria, signing the treaty with Hatti also provided Ramesses the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> about his [...] "defeat" [...] of the Hittites. Since Hattušiliš {{had been the one}} to approach Ramesses, the pharaoh in his depictions at the Ramesseum represents the settlement as one that the Hittite had asked for in a position of submission. Considering the official language of the treaties at the time was completely independent of one another, Ramesses was able to present the terms of the treaty from his perspective. This free control over the depictions of his role by the language of the treaty gave the pharaoh opportunity to present a greatly idealized point of view. His ability to assert a sense of supremacy as ruler of Egypt and his attempts to portray this strategic alliance as a victory over the Hittites demonstrate why Ramesses' would be so willing to choose such a mutually beneficial peace. The conclusion of open hostilities between the two regional powers was a personal triumph for the aging pharaoh and as his monument at Abu Simbel shows the pharaoh made his subjects well {{aware of the fact that}} he, Ramesses, was the conqueror of the Hittites.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accounts}} of this battle mainly {{are derived from}} Egyptian literary accounts known as the Bulletin (also known as the Record) and the Poem as well as pictorial Reliefs. Unfortunately for scholars and individuals interested in the Battle of Kadesh, the details that these sources provide are heavily biased interpretation of the events. Since Ramesses II had complete control over the building projects, the resources were used for propagandist purposes by the pharaoh, who used them <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> about his victory at Kadesh. It is still known that Ramesses marched through Syria with four divisions of troops {{in the hopes of}} destroying the Hittite presence there and restoring Egypt to the [...] "preeminent position it had enjoyed under Tuthmosis III". The Hittite king, Muwatalli II, gathered together an army of his allies to prevent the invasion of his territory. At the site of Kadesh, Ramesses foolishly outdistanced the remainder of his forces and, after hearing unreliable intelligence regarding the Hittite position from a pair of captured prisoners, the pharaoh pitched camp across from the town. The Hittite armies, hidden behind the town, launched a surprise attack against the Amun division and quickly sent the division scattering. Although Ramesses tried to rally his troops against the onslaught of the Hittite chariots, it was only after the arrival of relief forces from Amurru that the Hittite attack was thrown back.|$|E

2500|$|The bust of frontiersman Daniel Boone {{appears on}} the obverse—Boone lived in Missouri for the final quarter century of his life. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their 1988 book on {{commemorative}} coins, note speculation that the obverse may {{have been inspired by}} Albin Polasek's sculptured bust of Boone in the Hall of Fame for Great Americans in New York City. Boone wears a deerskin jacket and a coonskin cap. The centennial dates, the name of the country and the coin's denomination surround the bust. The reverse depicts Boone with rifle and powder horn, and a Native American—Swiatek and Breen noted that the frontiersman appears to be sending away the Indian, who bears a shield and peace pipe, apparently dramatizing Montgomery's desire to show the white man supplanting the Indian in Missouri [...] "as though this was something <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> about". The 1921 Report of the Director of the Mint describes the interaction as [...] "Daniel Boone, with powder and rifle, directing the attention of an Indian to the westward course of the white man". The Missouri Centennial half dollar, in having Boone on both sides, {{it is one of the}} few coins in United States numismatic history to have the same individual depicted on both sides. Other individuals so honored on commemoratives include Boone himself on the 1934–1938 Daniel Boone Bicentennial half dollar, Lafayette on the 1900-dated Lafayette dollar, the frontiersman on the 1936 Elgin, Illinois, Centennial half dollar, and Dwight Eisenhower on the 1990 Eisenhower commemorative dollar.|$|E
