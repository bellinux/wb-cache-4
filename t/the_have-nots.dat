She discussed her incorporation of the android as a metaphor for a minority, whilst being the role of the story's protagonist also. In {{an interview}} for Blues & Soul, Monáe said [...] "she represents the MEDIATOR between the haves and <b>the</b> <b>have-nots,</b> the minority and the majority. So in that way she’s very similar to Neo, the Archangel from The Matrix. And basically her return will mean freedom for the android community".|$|E
500|$|The {{physical}} {{violence in the}} story {{is a metaphor for}} the mechanisms behind capitalism. Morgan uses competition as theme throughout novel, punctuated by the [...] "portrayal of a society governed by extreme violence, ruthlessness and with no account for law, morals or humanity". Violent competition, where the losers die, is the norm and {{comes in the form of}} businesses competing for contracts, employees competing for promotions, foreign governments fighting insurgents, and other stand-offs between characters. Non-violent competition is viewed as a novelty or ineffective, like playing chess or publishing opinion essays. The existence of winners and losers and the duality of [...] "haves and the have-nots" [...] are contrasted. By illustrating how the First World exploits the Third World and the corporate executive's use of the ghetto areas, the novel challenges the idea that <b>the</b> <b>have-nots</b> are there by choice or that they competed and lost.|$|E
500|$|Following Laura's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Buzzworthy" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests {{attempted}} to launch a ball into a group of buckets {{in the shape of}} a honeycomb with the goal of being closest to the center. The HouseGuest who was closest to the center would be the Head of Household. Jessie was the winner. Though numerous HouseGuests expected Ronnie to be nominated that week, Jessie informed Natalie and Russell that he would be making his own decisions that week, rather than listening to the other HouseGuests. Natalie and Russell, fearing he would come after them, suggested that Casey should be targeted that week. On Day 20, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Back Yard Bash" [...] Have-Not competition. For this competition, one HouseGuest from each clique competed, and were required to attempt to fill their opponents cans with various plastic ice cubes; the clique with the most ice cubes in there can would be <b>the</b> <b>Have-Nots</b> for the week. The Brains clique, consisting of Chima, Michele, and Ronnie, were <b>the</b> <b>Have-Nots</b> for the week. Later that day, Jessie chose to nominate Jordan and Michele for eviction, with the intention of seeing Casey be evicted that week. Despite Jessie's nominations, Casey, Jeff, Jordan, and Michele were still under the impression that Ronnie was the target for eviction rather than Casey. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Jeff, Casey, and Chima were selected to compete; Natalie was selected to host. On Day 21, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "When Pigs Fly" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests dressed as pigs and were required to dig through mud in an attempt to find various truffles with point values on them, with each HouseGuest selecting four truffles to keep; the winner was the HouseGuest that had the highest total when combining the numbers on their truffles. Michele was the winner of the Power of Veto. On Day 23, Michele chose to use the Power of Veto to remove herself from the block, with Casey being nominated in her place. On Day 26, Casey became the third HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of seven to one.|$|E

500|$|On Day 4, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Big Brother Rave" [...] Have-Not competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were {{required}} to construct a series of pipes to spell out the word [...] "Have" [...] while neon [...] "Rave Juice" [...] flowed through the piping. If done correctly, the pipes would cause the juice to spill onto a wheel and cause it to spin; the last team {{to complete the task}} would be <b>the</b> <b>Have-Nots</b> for the week. The Brains clique lost the competition, meaning Chima, Michele, and Ronnie were <b>the</b> <b>Have-Nots</b> for the week. This greatly upset Chima, who stated on numerous occasions afterwards that she was debating walking from the game. Jessie took an immediate dislike to Laura, and hoped to put her up, though his clique members attempted to convince him that Lydia should be evicted that week. Due to Ronnie refusing to be nominated as a pawn, Chima later agreed to be nominated as a pawn. On Day 5, Jessie chose to nominate Chima and Lydia for eviction, with Lydia being his target for eviction. Worried they might not have the votes to keep Chima, Jessie and Russell formed an alliance with Laura in attempt to get her to evict Lydia. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Russell, Natalie, and Jeff were selected to compete for the Power of Veto; Casey was selected to host. On Day 7, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Pop Goes the Veto!" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to pop [...] "pimples" [...] on an over-sized face, with various Scrabble tiles inside of them. The HouseGuests would collect tiles and attempt to spell a word with their collected tiles; the HouseGuest with the longest correctly spelled word would win the Power of Veto. Russell was the winner of the Power of Veto. Following the competition, Jeff engaged in numerous arguments with Russell and Natalie, causing a rift in their clique. In an attempt to save herself, Lydia attempted to convince Russell and Jessie to backdoor Braden that week by taking her off the block as a way to hurt Jeff. Russell later told Ronnie that this was the plan, with Ronnie telling Braden, Jeff, and Jordan about the plan. On Day 9, Russell chose to use the Power of Veto to remove Lydia from the block, with Braden being nominated in her place. Following Braden's nomination, Jordan and Laura began campaigning to get the votes for him to stay, and appeared to have themselves, Casey, Jeff, Michele, and Ronnie in agreement; Ronnie, however, was playing both sides and had no intention of keeping Braden in the game. On Day 12, Braden became the first HouseGuest to be evicted from the house when Jessie cast the tie-breaker vote in Chima's favor.|$|E
500|$|Following Braden's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Most Likely To..." [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests {{attempted}} to correctly guess which clique the viewers felt best fit a certain scenario; when a HouseGuest answered correctly they could eliminate one contestant from the competition, while an incorrect answer led to their own elimination. Ronnie was the winner. Following the eviction, those who evicted Chima began to speculate that Ronnie had been the HouseGuest to change his vote, though he continued to deny this and blamed Michele. Laura, {{being one of the}} first to realize that Ronnie had been the one to change his vote, attempted to turn the other HouseGuests against him, though Chima and Natalie later informed Ronnie of this. On Day 13, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Who Knows The Ugly Truth?" [...] luxury competition. For this competition, former winner Dan Gheesling returned to host the competition, in which the HouseGuests were required to answer questions based on what a member of the opposite sex felt. The male and female winners of the competition would win the opportunity to see the film The Ugly Truth, as well as choose <b>the</b> <b>Have-Nots</b> for the week. Casey and Chima are the winners of the prize, and choose the Popular clique, consisting of Jordan and Laura, to be <b>the</b> <b>Have-Nots</b> for the week. Later that day, Ronnie chose to nominate Jeff and Laura for eviction. Ronnie revealed his intentions to be backdooring Russell that week, though his alliance felt as though Russell would have the votes to stay. Following a confrontation between Lydia and Russell, Lydia and Kevin approached Ronnie about backdooring Russell, and Natalie later debated turning on him as she felt he placed a target on her back. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Russell, Natalie, and Casey were selected to compete for the Power of Veto; Lydia was selected to host. On Day 14, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "Big Brother Mint" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were given an amount of money and had two minutes to attempt to get that amount of money in change. HouseGuests competed in rounds, and the HouseGuests farthest away from the goal amount each round was eliminated; the last HouseGuest remaining would win the Power of Veto. Jeff was the winner of the Power of Veto. Despite initially planning on nominating Russell after the Power of Veto was used, Ronnie later began to see Laura as a bigger threat, feeling she was smart enough to figure out his plans. On Day 16, Jeff chose to use the Power of Veto to remove himself from the block, with Jordan being nominated in his place. When Ronnie lied and stated that Russell was campaigning to keep Laura in the game, he was confronted by the majority of the HouseGuests and accused of lying and playing both sides of the house. Following these events, Russell followed Ronnie around the house calling him names and taunting him for days afterwards. On Day 19, Laura became the second HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of eight to one.|$|E
500|$|Following Lydia's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Can Do" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests stood atop a {{platform}} and attempted to drop aluminum cans into plastic tubes; the first HouseGuest to drop twenty-four cans into their tube would be the winner. Jeff was the winner. Due to having {{the least amount of}} cans in their tubes, Michele and Russell became <b>the</b> <b>Have-Nots</b> for the week. Due to the lie that Kevin had told Jeff, both Jeff and Jordan hoped to see Russell evicted. In an attempt to save themselves, Kevin and Natalie made a deal to get to the final four with Jeff and Jordan, and Jeff later told them he would nominate them as pawns in an attempt to backdoor Russell. On Day 48, Jeff chose to nominate Kevin and Natalie for eviction. Though Jeff continued to assure Michele and Russell that the plan was to evict Kevin, the two became suspicious that the plan was to backdoor one of them. On Day 49, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Otev the Ape" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were given a riddle by Otev the Ape and were required to search through various bananas in the backyard with the names of previously evicted HouseGuests on them to find the banana that would solve the riddle. The last HouseGuest to bring Otev the correct banana, or the HouseGuest who brought an incorrect banana, were eliminated each round. Jeff was the winner of the Power of Veto. On Day 51, Jeff chose to use the Power of Veto to remove Kevin from the block, with Russell being nominated in his place. Following his nomination, Russell engaged in numerous arguments with his fellow HouseGuests. On Day 54, Russell became the seventh HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a unanimous vote of three to zero. He became the third member of the Jury of Seven.|$|E

50|$|The houseguests {{went to the}} {{backyard}} expecting the next Head of Household competition, but to their surprise, {{the backyard}} was empty. They were informed that Canada would be week five's Head of Household. Viewers {{had the opportunity to}} nominate two people for eviction, though who would ultimately be evicted would still be up to the houseguests. In the have/have-not competition, the theme was Big Brother Prom. The houseguests are broken into four teams; one member had one minute to act out ten different dances, and for every correct dance identified, the group would receive one point. The group with the least amount of points in the end would be <b>the</b> <b>have-not’s</b> for <b>the</b> week. Jon and Adel became <b>the</b> <b>have-not’s.</b>|$|R
50|$|Only {{one other}} team, the declining Philadelphia 76ers of Billy Cunningham and Hal Greer had {{a winning record}} that year, {{for a total of}} just 6 out of the NBA's 14.

500|$|Following Ronnie's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Say what?" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were asked true or false {{questions}} about fan-submitted messages they had heard the previous night; an incorrect answer resulted in elimination, and the last HouseGuest remaining was the winner. Chima was the winner. On Day 34, HouseGuests competed in [...] "The Goods" [...] luxury competition. For this competition, actor Jeremy Piven entered the house to inform the HouseGuests of the competition. The HouseGuests split into teams and were required to fill a station wagon with various items that were worth different amounts of points; the team would only earn a point for the items they successfully fit into their car, and {{the team with the}} most points would earn the right to see the film The Goods. The team of Chima, Jordan, Jessie, Natalie, and Russell won the competition, meaning Jeff, Kevin, Lydia, and Michele were <b>the</b> <b>Have-Nots</b> for the week. Later that day, Chima chose to nominate Lydia and Russell for eviction. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Jeff, Kevin, and Natalie were selected to compete; Michele was selected to host. On Day 35, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "BB Farm" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were required to reach through a fence and attempt to get twelve eggs from {{the opposite side of the}} fence to them; the first HouseGuest to successfully get twelve eggs would win the Power of Veto. Kevin was the winner of the Power of Veto. On Day 37, Kevin chose not to use the Power of Veto on either nominee. On Day 40, Jeff chose to use the Coup d'État, thus overthrowing Head of Household Chima. He chose to remove both Lydia and Russell from the block, replacing them with Jessie and Natalie. Due to using the Coup d'État, Jeff was ineligible to vote during this eviction, as was Chima. Jessie then became the fifth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of three to two. He became the first member of the Jury of Seven.|$|E

2500|$|The Telegraph {{published}} {{an interview with}} Monáe, talking about her first studio album, in which the journalist Bernadette McNulty said, [...] "I begin to worry {{for a moment that}} Monáe may not just be a humourless science-fiction nerd, but actually an android herself, created in a laboratory as a super-musical cross between James Brown, Judy Garland, André 3000 and Steve Jobs, invented to test the desperate incredulity of music journalists." [...] She also compared Monáe to artists such as Annie Lennox, Lauryn Hill, and Corinne Bailey Rae. Her musical styles have been described as [...] "a soaring orchestral trip enlivened with blockbuster vocals, mysterious imagery and notes of Sixties pop and jazz". The Guardian has noted some of her influences as: Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Prince, Outkast, Erykah Badu, James Brown, Grace Jones, Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Jimi Hendrix, Bernard Herrmann, Funkadelic and the Incredible String Band. Matthew Valnes likens her dancing style in the music video for [...] "Tightrope", to that of James Brown. In an opinion piece for The Quietus, John Calvert places Janelle Monáe within the Afrofuturism movement, pointing out her similarities to Sun Ra and George Clinton. He asserts that Janelle Monáe is innovating the genre. Monáe has stated that she has an alter-ego named Cindi Mayweather who according to Monáe is from the year 2719. In [...] she gave her alter-ego a back-story stating that she was on the run after breaking the law in her home town of Metropolis by falling in love with a human named Anthony Greendown. Monáe explained about Cindi, saying [...] "The Archandroid, Cindi, is the mediator, between the mind and the hand. She's the mediator between the haves and <b>the</b> <b>have-nots,</b> the oppressed and the oppressor. She's like the Archangel in the Bible, and what Neo represents to the Matrix." [...] In her second album, Cindi Mayweather returned to Earth to liberate Metropolitans from the Great Divide, an oppressive oligarchy that used time travel to [...] "suppress freedom and love". Chris Champion of The Observer described Metropolis and The ArchAndroid as [...] "psychedelic soul with a sci-fi twist". Matthew Valnes describes Monáe as innovating a more contemporary Neo-Afrofuturism, where her android role is used as a tool to critique the representation of Black female musicians in the funk genre. Funk music of the 1960's through the 1980's is a prevalent music style influencing Monáe. On the website for Monáe's Wondaland Arts Society Collective, they assert [...] "We believe there are only three forms of music; good music, bad music, and funk." [...] Monáe has also referred to herself as a [...] "funkstress".|$|E

6000|$|The {{injustice}} {{of the existing}} set of rules simply appals the Radical. Yet oddly enough, this injustice itself appeals rather to the comparative looker-on than to the heavily-handicapped players in person. They, poor creatures, dragging their log in patience, have grown so accustomed to regarding the world as another man's oyster, that they put up uncomplainingly {{for the most part}} with the most patent inequalities. Perhaps 'tis their want of imagination that makes them unable to conceive any other state of things as even possible--like the dog who accepts kicking as the natural fate of doghood. At any rate, you will find, if you look about you, that the chief reformers are not, as a rule, the ill-used classes themselves, but the sensitive and thinking souls who hate and loathe the injustice with which others are treated. Most of the best Radicals I have known were men of gentle birth and breeding. Not all: others, just as earnest, just as eager, just as chivalrous, sprang from the masses. Yet the gently-reared preponderate. It is a common Tory taunt to say that the battle is one between the Haves and <b>the</b> <b>Have-nots.</b> That is by no means true. It is between the selfish Haves, on one side, and the unselfish Haves, who wish to see something done for <b>the</b> <b>Have-nots,</b> on the other. As for the poor Have-nots themselves, they are mostly inarticulate. Indeed, the Tory almost admits as much when he alters his tone and describes the sympathising and active few as [...] "paid agitators." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Again, the {{exclusive}} tendency of richer people--due, no doubt, {{to the increasing}} refinement of their education, and the widening gulf {{between them and the}} rude violence of the poor--is already leading to the closing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the surface of the land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the prettier country is shut in against intrusion. And this same widening gulf--which is due to the length and expense of the higher educational process and the increased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits {{on the part of the}} rich--will make that exchange between class and class, that promotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of our species along lines of social stratification, less and less frequent. So, in the end, above ground you must have the Haves, pursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty, and below ground <b>the</b> <b>Have-nots,</b> the Workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of their labour. Once they were there, they would no doubt have to pay rent, and not a little of it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and if they refused, they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such of them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die; and, in the end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would become as well adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as happy in their way, as the Upper-world people were to theirs. As it seemed to me, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed naturally enough.|$|E
60|$|This is {{so clearly}} evident that {{to any one}} who {{believes}} self-seeking is the ruling motive, the only possible motive in mankind, it seems incredible that your class ever will do anything than oppose to the last the advancement of Socialism. You will fight for what you have, and <b>the</b> <b>Have-nots</b> will fight to take it away. Therefore {{it is that the}} Socialists of the Social Democratic Federation preach a class war; to my mind a lurid, violent and distasteful prospect. We shall {{have to get out of}} the miseries and disorder of to-day, they think, if not by way of chateau-burning and tumbrils, at least by a mitigated equivalent of that. But I am not of that opinion. I have a lurking belief that you are not altogether eaten up by the claims of your own magnificence. While there are no doubt a number of people in your class who would fight like rats in a corner against, let us say, the feeding of poor people's starving children or the recovery of the land by the State to which it once belonged, I believe there is enough of nobility in your class as a whole to considerably damp their resistance. Because you have silver mirrors and silver hairbrushes, it does not follow that you have not a conscience. I am no believer in the theory that to be a sans-culotte is to be morally impeccable, or that a man loses his soul because he possesses thirty pairs of trousers beautifully folded by a valet. I cherish the belief that your very refinement will turn--I have seen it in one or two fine minds visibly turning--against the social conditions that made it possible. All this space, all this splendour has its traceable connection with the insufficiencies and miseries from which you are so remote. Once that realization comes to you the world changes. In certain lights, correlated with that, your magnificence can look, you will discover--forgive the word!--a little vulgar....|$|E

On Day 51, everyone but Pilar challenged in the [...] "Pin It to Win It" [...] Power of Veto competition. HouseGuests were shown a video showing different Canadian cities. They then had to take turns and put push pins with the names of the cities into a Canadian map. For every city they got correct, they got one ball for a plinko machine. Each round, they raced to get one ball to land into each slot (R for the first round, A for the second, M for the third, etc.). The last person to land their ball in each round will be eliminated. The last person standing will win the Power of Veto, along with 250,000 Windom rewards points. Sarah was the winner of the Power of Veto.

This definition was later reversed by a Mexican arts movement which transformed <b>the</b> <b>have-not</b> sensibility into a style, [...] "Rasquachismo," [...] suited {{to dealing with the}} material and professional limitations faced by artists in the movement. It is the [...] "view of the underdog, which combines inventiveness with a survivalist attitude." [...] Rasquache art uses the most basic, simplest, quickest, and crudest means necessary to create the desired expression, in essence, creating the most from the least. The term {{can also be used to}} reference the bicultural inspiration from which these artists draw inspiration. http://www.latinola.com/story.php?story=1659 ...|$|R
