25|$|Droste's {{earliest}} {{poems are}} derivative and conventional but in 1820 her work {{began to show}} marked originality when she embarked on a cycle of religious poems, Das geistliche Jahr ("The Spiritual Year"). Droste intended to write one poem for each Sunday and Feast Day of the church year and the cycle was meant to please her devout grandmother, but when Droste had completed 25 poems, she realised they were too personal and showed too many traces of spiritual doubt, so she shelved the work until 1839 when a friend persuaded her to complete the series. Even <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not publish the poems and they were only offered to the public posthumously in 1851.|$|E
500|$|She had {{her usual}} {{domestic}} success in 1993, {{including a new}} record time in the Coast to Coast. Her focus sharpened in early 1994 {{when it was announced}} that mountain biking would be an Olympic event at the 1996 Atlanta Games. Although she would be 39 <b>then,</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not want to give the selectors an opportunity to look past her. The 1994 domestic mountain bike season was the most competitive yet, with Kate Rattray and the visiting Susan DeMattei providing good competition, but it was 1995 where it counted. Rather than go for another veteran's medal, Lynch entered the Pro race at the 1995 UCI Mountain Bike World Championships in Kirchzarten in Germany's Black Forest. Lynch had a fierce start of the cross country race and led the field into the first climb. One by one, younger and full-time professional cylists went past her, and Lynch ended up 21st, with Mary Grigson 33rd, and the other Kiwis further back. They had gained New Zealand two qualifying positions for the Olympics; no New Zealand men qualified. Grigson accepted an offer to race for Australia and left New Zealand (she competed at the Olympics in 1996 and 2000), so the New Zealand Mountain Bike Association decided to nominate just one competitor for the New Zealand Olympic team. The team was announced on 16 April 1996 and Lynch's name came up. This was by no means a foregone conclusion, and Lynch thinks that she was selected against the selection panel's inclinations: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{penultimate}} {{scene of}} the play begins with the two clowns digging a grave for the late Ophelia. [...] They debate whether she {{should be allowed to}} have a Christian burial, because she committed suicide. [...] This quickly leads them into a discussion of the impact of politics on the decision, and the two parody lawyer speech. [...] They present Ophelia's case from both positions: if she jumped into the water, then she killed herself, but if the water effectively jumped on her, <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not. [...] The First Gravedigger laments the fact that the wealthy have more freedom to commit suicide than the poor.|$|E

50|$|Meygan - Meygan's older sister, Tanya and {{her friend}} Callie {{take her to the}} carnival, but boss her around and only do the things they want to do. Meygan wishes for {{everyone}} to go away, but her wish comes true and she finds she's the only one at the carnival. Then Meygan gets frightened at lots of clowns. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> goes back to where the magic show was. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> the magic and everyone appears.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never! Perhaps I shall live on; but I {{feel that}} it has killed me for this world. I don't know how a girl is {{to get over it}} when she has said that she has loved any one. If they are married, <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not want to get over it; but if they are not,--if he deserts her, or is unworthy, or both,--what can <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>then,</b> but just go on {{thinking}} of it till--she dies?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... [She {{looks at}} him, about to speak, <b>then</b> hesitates. <b>She</b> <b>does</b> not [...] dare, and {{resolves}} to be silent. ANNE {{comes to the}} rescue.] ...|$|R
60|$|Hetty turned very white. Then {{she looked}} up at Harry, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not say a single word.|$|E
60|$|Barbara Harding {{looked at}} him for a moment, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> the one thing that could have hurt him most--she laughed.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not love}} him! How {{could she have}} pretended love, and raised him to such a {{pinnacle}} of hope only to cast him down to such utter depths of despair! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Kill her,' he said. 'It is no {{more than}} she deserves for daring to marry the king's son. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> can <b>do</b> no more hurt to anyone.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Steve (Fred Allen) and Ramona Gladwyn (Ginger Rogers) are a husband-and-wife radio team whose on-air loving {{behavior}} on their show [...] "Breakfast with the Glad Gladwyns" [...] conceals {{the fact that}} they cannot stand each other. However, {{they do not want to}} lose their large salaries. When they arrive outside the marriage license bureau, they encounter a happy couple leaving. The sight makes Steve reconsider his relationship with Ramona, <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> too.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall we go {{and look}} at the aviary?" [...] said Mr. Magnet, {{reverting}} to a favourite idea of his, and <b>then</b> remembered <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not like to see caged birds.|$|R
60|$|GLORIA. She {{has never}} {{mentioned}} your name to me. (He groans involuntarily. She {{looks at him}} rather contemptuously and continues) Except once; and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> remind me of something I had forgotten.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs Dale {{was silent}} {{for a minute or two}} before she {{answered}} this, but <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> answer it. [...] "I think I do," [...] said she. [...] "I think I do wish for it." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{said no more}} {{until we}} reached {{the front of the}} Moyats' house. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not offer me her hand, but she stood quite close to me, and spoke in an unnaturally low tone.|$|E

50|$|The series {{centered}} on Emily (Graham), {{an editor of}} self-help books who is unable to find success in romance. In the premiere episode she ends a bad relationship and adopts a new rule for her romances: if she can list five reasons to break up with a guy <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> so. Emily gets help from her friends, among them Josh, whose character is strongly based on gay stereotypes. The show was widely considered a less risqu√© copycat of Sex and the City.|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{shall be}} the last, Walter," [...] she said. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> kiss him, as she would have kissed her brother that was going from her, and {{escaping}} from his arms she left the room.|$|E
60|$|She {{had dropped}} on one knee, as her {{companion}} fled, expecting he would overlook {{her as he}} passed, but his direct onset had extracted the feminine outcry. Yet even <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not seem greatly frightened.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned on}} him a look that cut him to the heart, with what he fancied its reproach and its wonder. She did not reply at once, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not reply to his hinted question.|$|E
5000|$|Billboard {{magazine}} {{reviewed the}} song favorably, saying that [...] "when she writes, she turns out masterpieces, and <b>then</b> when <b>she</b> <b>does</b> the interpretation herself, it is superb. This {{is a case}} in point." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{order of}} the solos varies in certain albums. In the movie and Roxy cast album, Columbia's solo is right after Magenta's, then Columbia does her tap dance after a second chorus. The version {{that has been in}} stage shows more {{recently}} is similar to the movie and Roxy cast, with Columbia singing her solo right after Magenta's, but <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> her tap dance right after her solo, leaving only two choruses. Occasionally, Columbia's solo and tap dance come after the chorus after Magenta's solo.|$|R
50|$|Rahel {{then joined}} the Audi DTM squad and {{replaced}} Katherine Legge in 2011. <b>Then</b> decided <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not wish to}} carry on with her DTM career and left {{at the start of}} the 2013 season.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> an unaccountable thing. She hunted an {{old piece}} of tape out of her pocket, and tied to crosswise, with a big loop, round the thaler, and hung it round {{the neck of the}} little Saint.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not just now," [...] she said, {{trailing}} aimlessly to the piano. She {{sat down}} and began to play at random, from memory. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> that most irritating thing‚Äîplayed accompaniments to songs, with snatches of the air where the voice should have predominated.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] asked Trot, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{exactly what}} she had been told not to do. She lifted her head and saw {{stretched}} over them a network of scrawny, crimson arms interlaced like the branches of trees in winter when the leaves have fallen and left them bare.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{understand}} that generalization,' answered her uncle; <b>then,</b> as <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not answer, he added, 'I am sure your Aunt Lily is {{very anxious to}} make you happy. Have you anything to complain of?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then,</b> as <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not like}} to send the letter out among the {{servants}} without any address, and thus to confess to them that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not know where her husband had gone, she directed the letter to him at his club in London.|$|R
