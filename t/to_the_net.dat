5|$|The energy {{generation}} of the Sun is based upon thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. This occurs in the core region of the star using the proton–proton chain reaction process. Because there is no convection in the solar core, the helium concentration builds up in that region without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature {{at the core of}} the Sun is too low for nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the triple-alpha process, so these atoms do not contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> {{energy generation}} that is needed to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{plays with}} a single-handed backhand, which gives him great variety. He employs the slice, {{occasionally}} {{using it to}} lure his opponent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> and deliver a passing shot. Federer can also fire topspin winners and possesses a 'flick' backhand with which he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net. His serve is difficult to read because he always uses a similar ball toss, regardless of what type of serve {{he is going to}} hit and where he aims to hit it, and turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200km/h (125mph); however, he is capable of serving at 220km/h (137mph). Federer is also accomplished at serve and volleying, and employed this tactic frequently in his early career.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Elena is {{kidnapped by}} Roman, and Nate reunites with Sully and follows {{him to the}} statue. Encouraged by Navarro, Roman opens the sarcophagus, exposing himself to an {{airborne}} virus. As he begins to turn, Navarro guns him down and orders his men to secure the statue {{so that he can}} sell the virus to the highest bidder on the black market. Nate jumps onto the net carrying the treasure which is connected to the transport chopper while a captive Elena gets the pilot killed, causing it to crash on Navarro's cargo ship. Nate kills the remaining mercenaries and attempts to rescue Elena, only to be attacked by Navarro. After a fistfight, he pulls her out of the chopper and pushes it overboard, taking Navarro, whose leg is tangled in the rope connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>net,</b> and the statue with it {{to the bottom of the}} sea.|$|E

5|$|Napoli {{shareholder}} equity on 30 June 2005 was {{a negative}} of €261,466, which the club started from €3 million capital and re-capitalized €3.8 million during 2004–05 Serie C1. On 30 June 2006 the equity was increased to €211,220, as the net loss {{was backed by}} a re-capitalisation of €9.3 million + €261,466 for previous net loss. On 30 June 2007 the equity was increased to €1,961,975, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> profit and a re-capitalisation of €288,780 (to make the share capital back to €500,000). On 30 June 2008 the equity was increased to €13,829,015 with a capital increase of just €1,000. The net income contributed the increase in equity on 30 June 2009, which was €24,763,537. On 30 June 2010 the equity was at €25,107,223. On 30 June 2011 the equity was increased to €29,305,052. Though less than €17 million equity contribution in total from Filmauro, Napoli achieved self-sustainability by good management and its large fans base.|$|E
5|$|Study {{has shown}} that the origin of charge is from certain types of {{subatomic}} particles which have the property of electric charge. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire. The informal term static electricity refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.|$|E

25|$|Intuitively, the theorem simply {{states that}} the sum of infinitesimal changes in a {{quantity}} over time (or over some other variable) adds up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> change in the quantity.|$|E
25|$|In SI units, it is {{measured}} in kilogram meters per second (kg·m/s). Newton's second law of motion states that a body's rate of change in momentum is equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> force acting on it.|$|E
25|$|The law of {{moment of}} {{momentum}} states that {{the sum of the}} moments of external forces acting on a fluid which is temporarily occupying the control volume is equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> change of angular momentum flux through the control volume.|$|E

25|$|The {{resulting}} forces must {{be balanced}} by {{the pressure on the}} inside of the bubble. This is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases inside due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> diffusion of gas to and from the bubble.|$|E
25|$|Roy {{was known}} for superstitious quirks. He often talked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> posts, and he never talked to reporters on days {{in which he was}} {{scheduled}} to play. He also refused to let his skates touch the red and blue lines on the ice, stepping over them.|$|E
25|$|Conservation of momentum: Newton's second law {{of motion}} {{applied to a}} control volume, is a {{statement}} that any change in momentum of the fluid within that control volume will be due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> flow of momentum into the volume and the action of external forces acting on the fluid within the volume.|$|E

50|$|In the 2006 NBA Playoffs, Johnson {{scored a}} career-high 40 points against <b>the</b> New Jersey <b>Nets</b> in Game 6 of the series. Despite his heroics, the Pacers lost 96-90, and <b>the</b> series 4-2 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nets.</b>|$|R
50|$|The current {{flagship}} {{radio station}} of <b>the</b> <b>Nets</b> is WFAN, which took over <b>the</b> radio rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nets</b> after losing their basketball {{contract with the}} Knicks (who moved to WEPN). Prior to that, Nets games aired on WNEW, WMCA, WVNJ, WNBC, WQEW, and WOR.|$|R
25|$|The {{advantage}} of alkyl aluminium and similar compounds {{is the high}} content of carbon and hydrogen, resulting in bright emission lines similar to spectral signature of burning jet fuel. Controlled content of solid combustion products, generating continuous black body radiation, allows further matching of emission characteristics <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> infrared emissions of fuel exhaust and hot engine components.|$|E
25|$|Shuffle: A {{technique}} for lateral movement when the puck is relatively close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>net.</b> The goaltender slides his legs, {{one at a}} time, in the desired direction. If the goaltender is not quick this technique momentarily leaves the five-hole open. This {{is the most common}} method of movement for a goaltender when in the butterfly position.|$|E
25|$|In a {{theoretical}} situation, a node would normally forward messages to a hub. The hub, {{acting as a}} distribution point for mail, might then send the message <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Net</b> Coordinator. From there it may be sent through a Regional Coordinator, or to some other system specifically {{set up for the}} function. Mail to other zones might be sent through a Zone Gate.|$|E
50|$|Instead {{of being}} used as the sole anti-submarine measure, {{indicator}} nets were often mixed with extensive minefields and patrolling warships. Sometimes mines were attached directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nets,</b> thus reducing submarine survival chances.|$|R
5000|$|The Kentucky Colonels, despite {{finishing}} {{the season with}} {{the best record in}} the history of the ABA (68-16, [...]810), winning 8 of 11 regular season games against <b>the</b> New York <b>Nets</b> and finishing 24 games ahead of <b>the</b> <b>Nets</b> in <b>the</b> regular season standings, lost their first round series <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nets.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{very similar}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 3D <b>net</b> for a 4D cubic pyramid, as <b>the</b> <b>net</b> for a square based is a square with triangles {{attached}} <b>to</b> each edge, <b>the</b> <b>net</b> for a cubic pyramid is a cube with square pyramids attached to each face.|$|R
25|$|Sampras was an all-court {{player who}} would often serve and volley. Possessing an {{all-around}} skill, {{in the early}} years of his career, when not serving, his strategy was to be offensive from the baseline, put opponents in a defensive position, and finish points at the net. In his later years, he became even more offensive and would either employ a chip-and-charge strategy or try to hit an offensive shot on the return and follow his return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>net.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although {{clomipramine}} shows around 100- to 200-fold {{preference in}} {{affinity for the}} SERT over the NET, its major active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine (norclomipramine), binds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>NET</b> with very high affinity (Ki = 0.32nM) and with dramatically reduced affinity for the SERT (Ki = 31.6nM). Moreover, desmethylclomipramine circulates at concentrations that are approximately twice those of clomipramine. In accordance, occupancy of both the SERT and the NET has been shown with clomipramine administration in positron emission tomography studies with humans and non-human primates. As such, clomipramine {{is in fact a}} fairly balanced SNRI rather than only a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI).|$|E
25|$|Tsonga {{is known}} for his {{offensive}} baseline style of play but is also able to mix his style of play up by rushing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>net.</b> He is also currently {{one of the very few}} remaining players who often utilize a serve-and-volley type of play. Tsonga's movement around the court is considered to be very good, considering his height. Tsonga is also known for his clutchness on serve, having saved 67% of the break points he faced in his career as of today, which ranks him in the 4th position among active players. His two weaknesses are his return of serve and to a lesser extent his backhand.|$|E
50|$|The NSW and Queensland also utilse {{acoustic}} pingers attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nets</b> <b>to</b> reduce bycatch of dolphins, {{whales and}} other marine mammals. Use of the pingers {{has been shown}} to significantly reduce marine mammal bycatch.|$|R
5000|$|Fishermen wade out at {{low tide}} with lave nets on their {{shoulders}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fishing grounds, with <b>the</b> water up <b>to</b> their waists. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> is then opened and lowered into the outgoing tide which rushes through <b>the</b> <b>net.</b> With his fingers placed at the bottom meshes of <b>the</b> <b>net,</b> <b>the</b> fisherman then waits for <b>the</b> fish <b>to</b> hit <b>the</b> <b>net.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dawkins {{was traded}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nets</b> during <b>the</b> 1982 {{off-season}} {{in exchange for}} a first round draft pick. At age 25, Dawkins joined a Nets club that included Albert King, Buck Williams, and Otis Birdsong. His first two seasons with <b>the</b> <b>Nets</b> were successful for both sides, as Dawkins experienced a career renaissance of sorts and <b>the</b> <b>Nets</b> had their most successful seasons to that point.|$|R
