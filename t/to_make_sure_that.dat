5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals {{was the only way to}} achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E

Complications arose when both Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul had problems with their condensers, a matter which was made much worse by the hot, tropical climate in which the ships were serving.|$|E

Brute vehicles and weapons featured in past Halo games helped influence the design changes and creation of new technology in the Banished's arsenal.|$|E
