40|$|AbstractPurposeUndergraduate {{students}} in the allied health science disciplines are normally required to complete a human anatomy course in their first year. Such courses, while popular, present challenges in <b>that</b> the content <b>requires</b> students to engage different approaches to learning. Recent literature reflects an increased interest in active, experiential learning activities to improve the learning of anatomy and physiology, but activities {{that focus on the}} development of metacognitive skills and visual-spatial thinking have been lacking. To address these inadequacies we developed a plasticine modeling and drawing activity in a tutorial room devoid of resources and visual cues referred to as the “blank page” room. The purpose of this manuscript is to communicate the merits of this intervention as an instructional technique used to facilitate the learning of anatomy for undergraduates of allied health disciplines. MethodDuring anatomy laboratory sessions we randomly allocated student groups to the activity of plasticine modeling and drawing (blank page technique) or the completion of written review questions. We compared the grades achieved by students who had been exposed to the blank page intervention with the grades achieved by students who were given standard review questions. We also collected qualitative feedback in the form of questionnaires <b>that</b> <b>required</b> <b>participating</b> students to rate the learning efficacy of the activities. ResultsStudents performed slightly better on assessment quizzes after the blank page activity compared with the review questions. Student feedback indicated that the blank page activity had greater learning value and promoted stronger engagement in the learning tasks. DiscussionThe blank page activity has merit in student engagement and facilitation of the learning of anatomy by broadening the scope of instruction to encompass multimodal learning preferences, metacognition and visual spatial thinking...|$|R

There is no simple “outsourcing.” Regional clusters that foster technological innovation depend on diverse sources of knowledge, government policies that foster new technologies rather than allow incumbent firms to dominate, and rich networks of relationships that enable the exchange of tacit knowledge (see summary by Gilbert 2012). Organizations willingly participate because they can tap into supplier networks or access customers. These clusters demonstrate that for complex innovation eco-systems, multiple organizations can co-create a context of mutual learning that enables participants to muster the staying power to persist and learn.|$|R

Many systems for acidic resistance (AR) under extremely acidic conditions have been reported, but the role of ATP has not been examined. To clarify whether or not ATP {{is necessary for the}} AR in Escherichia coli, the AR of mutants deficient in genes for ATP biosynthesis was investigated in this study. The deletion of purA or purB, each of which encodes enzymes to produce AMP from inosinate (IMP), markedly decreased the AR. The content of ATP in these mutants decreased rapidly at pH 2. 5 compared to that of the wild type. The AR was again decreased significantly by the mutation of adk, which encoded an enzyme to produce ADP from AMP. The DNA damage in the purA and purB mutants was higher than that in the wild type. These results demonstrated that metabolic processes <b>that</b> <b>require</b> ATP <b>participate</b> in survival under extremely acidic conditions, and that one such system is the ATP-dependent DNA repair system...|$|R

40|$|The European {{emissions}} trading scheme (EU-ETS) is a {{cap and trade}} system <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> the industries <b>participating</b> in the program to obtain allowances to cover their carbon emissions. Energy Intensive Industries claim that this system puts their European plants at an economics disadvantage compared to facilities located outside the EU. As a direct consequence, industries may relocate their production activities in unregulated countries, leading to the so-called carbon leakage effect. In order to curb this effect, several policies have been devised, including grandfathering of CO 2 allowances and border tax adjustment. This paper investigates {{the impact of these}} two policies on the cement sector, with a particular focus on the Italian market, particularly prone to carbon leakage. The analysis is based on an oligopolistic partial equilibrium model with a detailed technological representation of the market. The model is a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem that accounts for the interactions of cement companies. Simulations show that neither the grandfathering nor the border tax adjustment fully solve the carbon leakage problem because cement companies modify their cement and clinker trade strategies according to the measure applied in order to avoid or reduce their carbon costs...|$|R

Individuals and organizations generate huge amount of data through everyday activities. This data is either centralized for pattern identification or mined in a distributed fashion for efficient knowledge discovery and collaborative computation. This has raised serious concerns about privacy issues. The data mining community has responded to this challenge by developing a new breed of algorithms that are privacy preserving. The main objective of data mining is to extract the identified pattern for efficient knowledge discovery with centralized or decentralized collaborative computation. This paper focuses on developing secure computational model for preserving the privacy of the distributed data by performing multiparty computation in peer-to-peer network. However this approach <b>requires</b> <b>that</b> <b>participating</b> parties are attached to the coordinator of the peer-to-peer network through a specified path and maintain privacy by performing certain application specific computation on their local site.
