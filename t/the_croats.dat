5|$|Ivan Zajc's 1876 opera Nikola Šubić Zrinski is {{his most}} famous and popular work in Croatia. This recounts the heroic {{defiance}} of <b>the</b> <b>Croats</b> towards the Turks, {{as a metaphor for}} their later nationalist impulses within the Habsburg monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius entered {{diplomatic}} relations with <b>the</b> <b>Croats</b> and Serbs in the Balkans. He tried to repair the schism in the Christian church {{in regard to the}} Monophysites, by promoting a compromise doctrine called Monothelitism. The Church of the East (commonly called Nestorian) was also involved in the process. Eventually this project of unity was rejected by all sides of the dispute.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Frederick {{thought the}} sounds of the battle were either an outpost {{skirmish}} or <b>the</b> <b>Croats,</b> who apparently started their days with regular firing of their weapons. His staff had trouble rousing him from bed, but he was soon alerted when Prussian cannons, captured by the Austrians, started to fire on his own camp.|$|E

50|$|In reality, Croatian {{military}} forces at {{the area in}} September were virtually non-existent. <b>The</b> <b>Croat</b> forces consisted of just one locally conscripted unit, which numbered less than 1,500 men and had no tanks or heavy guns. Also, there were no mercenaries, Kurdish or otherwise, on <b>the</b> <b>Croat</b> side.|$|R
50|$|This {{would make}} <b>the</b> <b>Croat</b> entity {{virtually}} a symmetric {{version of the}} current Federation (70% Bosniak, 22% Croat, 2% Serb). If only the western, Croat-inhabited part of Mostar municipality {{is included in the}} entity, this would reduce the number of Bosniaks in <b>the</b> <b>Croat</b> entity by roughly 45.000 and increase Croat majority to 83%. If Jajce, Travnik and Uskoplje municipalities would be divided into Croat- and Bosniak-majority municipalities to be added to two entities, respectively, Večernji list claims that as much as 83% of Federation's Croats would end up in <b>the</b> <b>Croat</b> federal unit.|$|R
5|$|According to {{the work}} De Administrando Imperio written by the 10th-century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, <b>the</b> <b>Croats</b> had arrived in what is today Croatia in the early 7thcentury; however, that claim is disputed and {{competing}} hypotheses date the event between the 6th and the 9th centuries. Eventually two dukedoms were formed—Duchy of Pannonia and Duchy of Croatia, ruled by Liudewit and Borna, as attested by chronicles of Einhard starting in 818. The record represents the first document of Croatian realms, vassal states of Francia at the time.|$|E
5|$|Charlemagne, King of the Franks from 768 {{until his}} death in 814, {{expanded}} the Frankish kingdom into an empire that incorporated much of western and central Europe. He brought the Frankish state {{face to face with the}} Slavs to the northeast and the Avars and Slavs to the southeast of the Frankish empire. <b>The</b> <b>Croats</b> lived in Pannonian Croatia and Dalmatian Croatia (Littoral Croatia) to the southeast of the Frankish Empire. Dalmatian Croatia was ruled by Duke Višeslav, one of the first known Croatian dukes.|$|E
5|$|Salona, {{the capital}} of the {{province}} of Dalmatia was sacked and destroyed in 614 by Avars and Slavs. The population fled to Diocletian's walled palace of Split, which was able to hold up. Thereafter, Split rose quickly in importance, as one of Dalmatia's major cities. After a few decades, the Avars were driven out by <b>the</b> <b>Croats.</b> This probably happened after 620, when in second wave Croats migrated on the invitation by the Emperor Heraclius to counter the Avar threat on the Byzantine Empire.|$|E

5000|$|In 1915, during World War I in Galicia, Croatian {{soldiers}} {{serving in}} the Austro-Hungarian Army were sent on Eastern Front to fight against Russian Army and Circassian bandits. An Austrian-Hungarian soldier who has survived <b>the</b> battle, a <b>Croat,</b> takes uniform and identification tag from a dead NCO. Later, <b>the</b> <b>Croat</b> {{and a group of}} Croatian and Hungarian deserters are captured by the Austrians led by Lieutenant Ali Tiffenbach. Before <b>the</b> <b>Croat</b> could be executed by firing squad {{with the rest of the}} deserters, he is mistaken for Zugsführer Josef, the dead NCO whose identification tag he's carrying. The Austrian Colonel decides to spare <b>the</b> <b>Croat</b> because Josef is well known as a regimental fencing champion, much to the disappointment of Lieutenant Tiffenbach, who suspects that <b>the</b> <b>Croat</b> is an impostor. Tiffenbach later confirms his suspicions when he easily defeats [...] "Josef" [...] in a sword duel.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>croat</b> was {{originally}} worth twelve terns of 25% silver billon. In 1340 the gold florín was introduced at {{a value of}} eleven <b>croats.</b> <b>The</b> purity of the florín was fixed at eighteen carats (75% gold) in 1365. As {{the popularity of the}} florín and <b>the</b> <b>croat</b> grew, <b>the</b> Aragonese empire settled into bimetallism. <b>The</b> Catalan <b>croat</b> was equivalent in value to the Aragonese ral (which went by many names: grosso, real, alfonsino, anfusinus). It was the most stable of all the Aragonese coinage and widely used in the Mediterranean trade.|$|R
5|$|The battle also {{affected}} the Serbs and <b>the</b> <b>Croats,</b> who {{were forced to}} acknowledge the supremacy of the Byzantine Emperor after 1018. The borders of the Byzantine Empire were restored to the Danube {{for the first time}} since the 7th century, allowing Byzantium to control the entire Balkan peninsula from the Danube to the Peloponnese and from the Adriatic Sea to the Black Sea.|$|E
5|$|After decisive Ottoman {{victory at}} the Battle of Krbava field in 1493, and {{especially}} after the Battle of Mohács in 1526, <b>the</b> <b>Croats</b> continued defending themselves against the Ottoman attacks. The Ottoman conquest {{during the early years}} of the 16th century prompted the formation of the Uskoks, which were led by Croatian captain Petar Kružić, also called (Prince of Klis). As a part of the Habsburg defensive system, Uskoks used the base at Klis as an important defensive position. They fought almost alone against the Ottomans, and for more than two decades defended the fortress against the Ottoman attacks.|$|E
5|$|After the Croatian Democratic Union won 1990 {{parliamentary}} {{elections in the}} Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions between Croats and Serbs within the Republic worsened. The ethnic groups are also divided along religious lines as <b>the</b> <b>Croats</b> are Catholics while the Serbs are Orthodox Christians. The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) confiscated the weapons of Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana - TO) forces to minimize resistance. On 17 August, tensions escalated into an open revolt by Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, {{and parts of the}} Lika, Kordun, Banovina and eastern Croatia. This revolt was followed in January 1991, by two unsuccessful attempts by Serbia, supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo, to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Croat</b> {{quest for}} {{independence}} led to large Serb communities within Croatia rebelling {{and trying to}} secede from <b>the</b> <b>Croat</b> republic.

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Kingdom of Bosnia into the Ottoman hands in 1463, the {{southern}} and central parts of the Kingdom of Croatia remained unprotected, the defense of which was left to Croatian gentry who kept smaller troops in the fortified border areas at their own expense. Decisive Ottoman victory at the Battle of Krbava field in 1493, shook all of Croatia. However, it did not dissuade <b>the</b> <b>Croats</b> from making more decisive and persistent attempts at defending themselves against the attacks of the much larger enemy. A new wave of Ottoman conquest began in 1521, after which a good portion of Croatia was conquered or pillaged.|$|E
5|$|As he withdrew, Frederick {{established}} a fighting line {{north of the}} village, and it eventually served as a rallying point for stragglers and survivors. By mid-morning, around 10:00, the Prussians retreated to the north-west. Any pursuing troops were met with a wall of musket fire. Frederick and his surviving army were {{out of range of}} the Austrian army by the time they had reorganized. Hans Joachim von Zieten and Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, who also had remained alert all night, organized a rear guard action that prevented the Austrians from falling upon the retreating Prussians. This discouraged even the most determined Austrians; <b>the</b> <b>Croats</b> and irregulars contented themselves with pillaging the village and the Prussian bodies.|$|E
5|$|Daun's {{battle plan}} took the Prussians {{completely}} by surprise. The {{east side of}} Frederick's line {{was the first to}} be attacked. Using the starless night and fog as cover, and grouped into small shock units for easier control and stealth, the Austrians fell on the Prussian battery when the church bell signaled 5:00, catching the Prussians completely off guard. Many men were still sleeping, or just waking up, when the attack started. After setting fire to the village, <b>the</b> <b>Croats</b> cut tent ropes, causing the canvas to fall on sleeping soldiers, then bayoneted the men as they struggled to free themselves from canvas and cords. Men tangled in the tents bled to death, in what today is still called Blutgasse, or Blood Alley.|$|E

5|$|Humanitarian {{workers and}} foreign {{military}} observers had suspicions that <b>the</b> <b>Croats</b> deliberately abandoned Jajce, {{as well as}} territories lost in Operation Corridor 92, to the VRS {{in exchange for the}} Prevlaka Peninsula south of Dubrovnik. Even though Croatia and several Western diplomats denied this claim, European Community envoy David Owen urged the UN to impose sanctions against Croatia. The suspicion was fueled by an October 1992 agreement between Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and Yugoslav President Dobrica Ćosić to withdraw the JNA from Prevlaka. However, the JNA withdrawal from Croatian soil had also {{been a part of the}} Vance plan, which was accepted by both Croatia and Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944, Meyszner's {{campaign}} against the German-Chetnik agreements escalated sharply. He had unusual allies in this, as Nedić and Ljotić also opposed them, in their case because the agreements tended to sideline them in favour of the Chetniks. In particular, Meyszner strongly opposed the further arming of the Chetniks led by Đurišić and Lukačević, {{on the grounds that}} they had not upheld their previous agreements and that <b>the</b> <b>Croats,</b> as well as Muslims in Albania, Kosovo and the Sandžak, had expressed concerns about any strengthening of the Chetniks. The commander of the Bulgarian 1st Occupation Corps, General Asen Nikoloff, also opposed the agreements. Meyszner's increasing objections to the agreements coincided with growing Partisan pressure from the west and the advance of the Red Army from the east.|$|E
5|$|The {{demographic}} {{history of}} Croatia is characterised by significant migrations, {{starting with the}} arrival of <b>the</b> <b>Croats</b> in the area. According to the work De Administrando Imperio written by the 10th-century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, <b>the</b> <b>Croats</b> arrived in the area of modern-day Croatia in the early 7thcentury. However, that claim is disputed, and competing hypotheses date the event between the 6th and the 9th centuries. Following the establishment of a personal union of Croatia and Hungary in 1102, and the joining of the Habsburg Empire in 1527, the Hungarian and German speaking population of Croatia began gradually increasing in number. The processes of Magyarization and Germanization varied in intensity but persisted to the 20th century. The Ottoman conquests initiated a westward migration of parts of the Croatian population; the Burgenland Croats are direct descendants of some of those settlers. To replace the fleeing Croats the Habsburgs called on the Orthodox populations of Bosnia and Serbia to provide military service in the Croatian Military Frontier. Serb migration into this region peaked during the Great Serb Migrations of 1690 and 1737–39. Similarly, Venetian Republic rule in Istria and in Dalmatia, following the Fifth and the Seventh Ottoman–Venetian Wars ushered gradual growth of Italian speaking population in those areas. Following the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918, the Hungarian population declined, especially in the areas north of the Drava river, where they represented the majority before World War I.|$|E

According to testimonies of surviving residents of Voćin, the White Eagles and several local Serbs terrorised <b>the</b> <b>Croat</b> population, reduced to 80 by late 1991.

5|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Western Roman Empire, which included the territory occupied by modern-day Slavonia, the area became a part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom {{by the end of the}} 5th century. However, control of the area proved a significant task, and Lombards were given increasing control of Pannonia in the 6th century, which ended in their withdrawal in 568 and the arrival of Pannonian Avars and Slavs, who established control of Pannonia by year 582. According to the work De Administrando Imperio written by the 10th century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, <b>the</b> <b>Croats</b> had arrived in the early 7thcentury in the then region of Dalmatia, although this is disputed and competing hypotheses date the event between the 6th and the 9th centuries. Eventually a dukedom was formed, Duchy of Dalmatia, ruled by Borna, as attested to by the chronicles of Einhard, starting in the year 818. This record represents the first document of the Croatian state, vassal of Francia at the time. The Frankish overlordship ended during the reign of Mislav two decades later.|$|E
5|$|Croatia is {{inhabited}} {{mostly by}} Croats (90.4%), while minorities include Serbs (4.5%), and 21 other ethnicities (less than 1% each). The demographic history of Croatia {{is marked by}} significant migrations, including the arrival of <b>the</b> <b>Croats</b> in the area growth of Hungarian and German speaking population since the union of Croatia and Hungary, and joining of the Habsburg Empire, migrations set off by Ottoman conquests and growth of Italian speaking population in Istria and in Dalmatia during Venetian rule there. After the collapse of Austria-Hungary, the Hungarian population declined, while the German-speaking population was forced or compelled to leave after World War II and similar fate was suffered by the Italian population. Late 19th century and the 20th century were marked by large scale economic migrations abroad. The 1940s and the 1950s in Yugoslavia were marked by internal migrations in Yugoslavia, {{as well as by}} urbanisation. The most recent significant migrations came {{as a result of the}} Croatian War of Independence when hundreds of thousands were displaced.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April, the German XLVI Motorised Corps {{completed}} its preparations for full-scale offensive action by expanding its bridgehead at Gyékényes. The cavalry units continued {{to fight the}} Germans around Peteranec, but the left sector of the divisional front line began to disintegrate. The commander of the right sector, Pukovnik Mihailo Georgijević ordered his troops to hold their positions and went to divisional headquarters to ask approval to discharge <b>the</b> <b>Croats</b> in his units. Marić would not inform 4th Army headquarters of this idea, so Georgijević went to Zagreb to speak to Petrović, and to further urge him to withdraw all troops that still wanted to fight to a line south of the Sava. According to Georgijević, Petrović ordered him to tell Marić to consider disarming his Croat troops, and to continue to hold positions on {{the line of the}} Bilogora, but to conduct a fighting withdrawal towards Zagreb and Sisak if the German pressure was too great. The intent of these orders was not implemented, as fifth column elements changed the wording so that orders were issued to discharge Croat troops and to retreat towards Zagreb without fighting.|$|E
