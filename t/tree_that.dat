5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether {{the story of the}} <b>Tree</b> <b>That</b> Owns Itself began with the Weekly Banner article, or if it had been an element of local {{folklore}} prior to that time. The article's author writes that, in 1890, there were few people still living who knew the story.|$|E
5|$|One {{section of}} the M11 {{extension}} was due to tunnel under George Green in Wanstead. Residents had believed that this would save their green, and a 250-year-old sweet chestnut <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> grew upon it, but {{because this was a}} cut and cover tunnel, this required the tree to be cut down.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the story}} of the <b>Tree</b> <b>That</b> Owns Itself is more legend than history, the tree has become (along with the University Arch and the Double-Barreled Cannon) one of the most {{recognized}} and well-loved symbols of Athens. It is routinely featured in travel guides and other visitor information, and has even garnered international recognition through such publications as Ripley's Believe It Or Not, where it has been featured on several occasions.|$|E
50|$|Twelve elm <b>trees</b> <b>that</b> {{represented}} the twelve apostles of Jesus were originally {{planted in the}} gardens as gifts from the owners of local townhouses, but these were later part of 38 <b>trees</b> <b>that</b> were cut down due to disease. The felled trees were replaced by beech and elm <b>trees</b> <b>that</b> form a natural border with the Waters of Leith at the bottom part of the gardens.

5|$|Banksia integrifolia, {{commonly}} known as coast banksia, is a species of <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> grows along {{the east coast of}} Australia. One of the most widely distributed Banksia species, it occurs between Victoria and Central Queensland in a broad range of habitats, from coastal dunes to mountains. It is highly variable in form, but is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (82ft) in height. Its leaves have dark green upper surfaces and white undersides, a contrast that can be striking on windy days.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequences}} can be {{mapped to}} reveal a phylogenetic <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> represents evolutionary relationships, with each branch point representing the divergence of two lineages from a common ancestor. On this tree the term basal is used to describe a lineage that forms a branch diverging nearest to the common ancestor. Wolf genetic sequencing has found the Beringian wolf to be basal to all other gray wolves except for the modern Indian gray wolf and Himalayan wolf, and the extinct Belgian clade of Pleistocene wolves.|$|E
5|$|He thought {{its closest}} {{relatives}} to be Banksia speciosa and B.baxteri, {{and that it}} also formed a link with eastern species, particularly Banksia serrata. Since Brown's original publication had treated all of Fraser's specimens as syntypes for the species, George also chose a lectotype, selecting a <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> Fraser had received from Macleay in May 1828.|$|E

5|$|The Waterloo {{position}} {{was a strong}} one. It consisted of a long ridge running east-west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along {{the crest of the}} ridge ran the Ohain road, a deep sunken lane. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was a large elm <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.|$|E

The two cry over their loss. Later, the two gather at Finn's outdoor memorial at McKinley, which includes a <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> Puck had stolen as a memento and later replanted at Beiste's behest, and Puck tells the coach that he has decided to join the Air Force.|$|E

5|$|Gallimimus are {{featured}} in a stampede scene where {{one of them is}} devoured by the Tyrannosaurus. The Gallimimus was the first dinosaur to receive a digital version, being featured in two ILM tests, first as a herd of skeletons and then fully skinned while pursued by the T. rex. Its design was based on ostriches, and to emphasize the birdlike qualities, the animation focused mostly on the herd rather than individual animals. As reference for the dinosaurs' run, the animators were filmed running at the ILM parking lot, with plastic pipes standing in as the <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> the Gallimimus jump over. The footage even inspired to incorporate an animal falling in its leap as one of the artists crashed making the jump. Horse squeals became the Gallimimus sounds.|$|E
5|$|Icewind Dale II {{takes place}} in the Forgotten Realms D {{campaign}} setting, on the continent of Faerûn. It centers on the northern Icewind Dale region, and is set thirty years after the original game. The game begins in the harbor town of Targos, one of the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale, which is under siege by a goblin army. The goblins are directed by the Legion of the Chimera, an army composed of outcast races and religious factions, such as goblinoids, half-breeds, and followers of winter goddess Auril. Targos hires mercenaries to defend against the attack. Areas encountered in the game include: the Black Raven Monastery, built over an entrance to the Underdark; the town of Kuldahar, constructed around a magical <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> emits heat; the Severed Hand, an ancient elven fortress that was lost during a war with goblinoids; and the Dragon's Eye, a network of volcanic caverns inhabited by yuan-ti. Other areas include the Underdark and the Jungles of Chult.|$|E
5|$|In Tampico, {{near the}} {{location}} of the storm's second landfall, the streets were littered with fallen trees branches, utility poles, and billboards. Additionally, many roads were inundated with water, leaving some impassable. Nearby, over 700people fled their homes for shelter due to flooding in Ciudad Madero. One death occurred in Pueblo Viejo when a woman was crushed by a <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> fell on her house. Six other deaths occurred in Veracruz, five from a ship capsizing near Boca del Río and another after a person was caught in an undertow offshore Úrsulo Galván. Two landslides in northern Puebla left roads impassable, isolating some communities such as Tlatlauquitepec. Hundreds of homes were destroyed leaving 35,000people homeless and there was severe damage in Tuxpan, Tamiahua, Pueblo Viejo, Platon, Pánuco, Tampico Alto, and elsewhere along the coast of northeast Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Joseph {{is said to}} {{have arrived}} in Glastonbury by boat over the flooded Somerset Levels. On {{disembarking}} he stuck his staff into the ground and it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn (or Holy Thorn). This is said to explain a hybrid Crataegus monogyna (hawthorn) <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> only grows within a few miles of Glastonbury, and which flowers twice annually, once in spring and again around Christmas time (depending on the weather). Each year a sprig of thorn is cut, by the local Anglican vicar and the eldest child from St John's School, and sent to the Queen.|$|E
5|$|Many {{problems}} in data analysis concern clustering, grouping data items into clusters of closely related items. Hierarchical clustering is {{a version of}} cluster analysis in which the clusters form a hierarchy or tree-like structure rather than a strict partition of the data items. In some cases, this type of clustering may be performed {{as a way of}} performing cluster analysis at multiple different scales simultaneously. In others, the data to be analyzed naturally has an unknown tree structure and the goal is to recover that structure by performing the analysis. Both of these kinds of analysis can be seen, for instance, in the application of hierarchical clustering to biological taxonomy. In this application, different living things are grouped into clusters at different scales or levels of similarity (species, genus, family, etc). This analysis simultaneously gives a multi-scale grouping of the organisms of the present age, and aims to accurately reconstruct the branching process or evolutionary <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> in past ages produced these organisms.|$|E
5|$|Markway becomes {{alarmed at}} Eleanor's {{obsession}} with Hill House {{in spite of}} the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home. Before he can join her in the car, Eleanor drives off and speeds down the road toward the front gates. She soon feels the steering wheel move by itself and the car advances erratically. At first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. Suddenly Grace appears from behind a tree and steps in front of the car. Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her. He notes that the <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> claimed Eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted—to remain with the house.|$|E
