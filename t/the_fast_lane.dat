25|$|The race {{restarted}} {{at the end}} of lap {{three with}} Rosenqvist being forced to defend first place from Lynn after losing fraction in his tyres from driving behind the safety car. Lynn steered to the outside of Rosenqvist going into Lisboa corner and turned in to take over the lead. Félix da Costa overtook Auer for third on the run up to Mandarin Oriental bend, and Auer lost a further place to Marciello at Lisboa turn. Auer then crashed heavily into the barriers at San Francisco bend while defending from Derani, ending his race early. Shortly after Jones hit a bump going off the racing line at Fisherman's Bend and made contact with the wall. Yellow flags were waved in the area but were withdrawn after he was removed from the circuit. Up front Lynn continued to lead Rosenqvist while Félix da Costa was being hounded by Marciello for third. Similarly King was battling Sims for fifth with Coletti, Buller and Ocon running in close formation in a battle for sixth. Mason was handed a drive-through penalty after his team started his engine while stationary in <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> <b>lane</b> of the pit lane.

25|$|The second {{qualifying}} session began {{fifteen minutes}} later than scheduled due to freight for the Guia Race of Macau being stranded in Beijing, and was further delayed by crashes in the local touring car support races. When the session did start, Jarvis set the early pace before he was eclipsed by Tsukakoshi one minute before the conclusion of second qualifying. This was immediately bettered by Jarvis with a lap of two minutes and 11.696 which he held to secure pole position for the qualifying race. Amser set his best time on his last lap to join Jarvis on {{the front row of}} the grid. Tsukakoshi was 0.216 seconds adrift in third place. Buemi remained in fourth position with Mortara moving up four positions to fifth. Grosjean's effort in second qualifying dropped him to sixth overall while teammate Kobayashi similarly lost ground and could only manage seventh. The top ten was completed by Oshima, Streit and Buurman. Behind them {{the rest of the field}} consisted of Jakes, Guerrieri, Jelley, Van Dam, Hülkenberg, Bird, Breen, Senna, Kennard, Mustonen, Hartley, Mailleux, Van Der Zande, Izawa, Ho, Ávila, Grubmüller, Lou Meng, Kit Meng and Merszei. The session was halted three times: firstly for Van Der Zande who crashed into the barriers leaving Paiol corner and debris was littered across the track. Hartley was the cause of the second stoppage when he impacted the wall at the exit of Lisboa turn and his car was stranded in a dangerous position. The final stoppage was for Grubmüller who went into the barriers on his out-lap. Buemi and Buurman each received penalties after second qualifying: Buemi was summoned to the stewards office for a review of his fastest lap and they felt his attempt was recorded under yellow flag conditions. Thus, Buemi was demoted five places on the grid. Buurman dropped three positions after he was adjudged to move into <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> <b>lane</b> of the pit lane before it was declared open.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualifying}} period was {{split into two}} sessions; the first was held on Thursday afternoon and ran for 40 minutes with the second held on Friday afternoon and was similarly timed to the previous day's session. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final starting position for the qualification race. The first qualifying session saw Asmer {{come out on top}} with a time of two minutes and 13.122 seconds set nine minutes remaining in the session. The heavy damage to Grosjean's car forced him to sit out the session's opening minutes and gradually improved to be two-tenths adrift of Asmer and settled for provisionally second. Despite clipping the wall Yelmer Buurman ran strongly throughout and finished in third place with Buemi battling for pole position {{for the majority of the}} session until he dropped to fourth. Esteban Guerrieri made an improvement late on to end up fifth in front of Tsukakoshi in sixth and 2006 pole sitter Kamui Kobayashi stood in seventh. James Jakes, Streit and Jelley rounded out the top ten. Although he was at one point high up as fourth in the time sheets Jarvis was the quickest driver not to reach the top ten. Following him were the highest placed rookie Mortara, Oshima with Hülkenberg provisionally joining the Japanese driver on the seventh row in spite of him glancing the tyre barriers at Lisboa corner. Niall Breen was next up ahead of Atte Mustonen, Jonathan Kennard, Van Dam, Renger van der Zande and Senna. The rest of the order was completed Bird, Mailleux, Hartley, Grubmüller, Takuya Izawa, Ávila, Ho, Kit Meng. Cheong Lou Meng and the only driver to fail to record within 110% of Asmer was Merszei. Other incidents that occurred during first qualifying were Mustonen damaging his suspension against the tyre wall and Bird went into the barrier at Fisherman's Bend. Senna then crashed into the tyre barriers at San Francisco Bend and then was impacted by Izawa which prompted the waving of the red flags. After qualifying, numerous penalties were handed out. Kobayashi and Mutstonen were given three-place grid penalties for moving into <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> <b>lane</b> of the pit lane before it was declared open. Hülkenberg and Lou Meng were similarly penalised for ignoring the red light signal at the end of the pit lane which mandated them to enter the weighbridge.|$|E
