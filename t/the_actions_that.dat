Some commentators have argued that prosecutions of state and local officials under these statutes pose substantial federalism questions, while others argue that the Guarantee Clause provides additional authority for such prosecutions.|$|E

5|$|In 1543, several {{conservative}} clergymen in Kent {{banded together}} to attack and denounce two reformers, Richard Turner and John Bland, before the Privy Council. They prepared articles {{to present to the}} Council, but at the last moment, additional denunciations were added by Stephen Gardiner's nephew, Germain Gardiner. These new articles attacked Cranmer and listed his misdeeds back to 1541. This document and <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>that</b> followed were the basis of the so-called Prebendaries' Plot. The articles were delivered to the Council in London and were probably read on 22 April 1543. The king most likely saw the articles against Cranmer that night. The archbishop, however, appeared unaware that an attack on his person was made. His commissioners in Lambeth dealt specifically with Turner's case where he was acquitted, much to the fury of the conservatives.|$|E
5|$|Born in Auckland, Bassett was a bank worker {{when the}} First World War began. A member of New Zealand's Territorial Force, he volunteered for service abroad with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) and was posted to the New Zealand Divisional Signal Company as a sapper. He saw {{action on the}} opening day of the Gallipoli Campaign, and it was during the Battle of Chunuk Bair that he {{performed}} <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>that</b> led to his award of the VC. Medically evacuated due to sickness shortly after the battle, he later served on the Western Front and finished the war as a second lieutenant. He returned to the banking profession but was recalled to active duty during the Second World War. He served on the Home Front {{and by the time he}} was taken off active duty in December 1943, he had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and was commander of signals in the Northern Military District. When he retired from his banking career he became a justice of the peace in Devonport. He died in 1983 at the age of 91.|$|E

25|$|Corporate finance is {{the area}} of finance dealing with the sources of funding and the capital {{structure}} of corporations, <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>that</b> managers take to increase {{the value of the}} firm to the shareholders, and the tools and analysis used to allocate financial resources.

He, however, dies on the voyage from England. The narrator and her family are put up in the finest house in the settlement, in accord with their station, and the narrator's experiences of meeting the indigenous peoples and slaves are intermixed with the main plot of the love of Oroonoko and Imoinda. At the conclusion of the love story, the narrator leaves Surinam for London.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} the course of this battle that Keysor {{performed}} <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>that</b> led to him receiving the Victoria Cross. Early in the morning on 6 August 1915 the 1st Battalion carried out a diversionary attack at Lone Pine and after heavy fighting that lasted almost the entire day they managed to capture the Turkish trenches. After this more fighting would continue around the position for the next three days as the Turks attempted to regain the position. The fighting was carried out at close range, using bayonets and improvised grenades and bombs. Over the course of about 50 hours on 7–8 August, Keysor continually risked his life to pick up the Turkish grenades as they were thrown into the trenches and throw them back. Later, despite being wounded and ordered to seek medical attention, Keysor continued to remain in the line, volunteering to throw bombs for another company.|$|E
25|$|Wilkinson {{transferred}} to the Royal Artillery on 1 June 1942, and was again a temporary lieutenant-colonel, commanding 99th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, when on 13 May 1944, during {{the final stages of}} the Battle of Monte Cassino he performed <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>that</b> led to his appointment as a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order on 21 September 1944. His regiment had been detailed to make smoke to cover the bridges over the Gari River, early in the day it was reported that there was no smoke covering one particular bridge (codenamed Amazon). Wilkinson took a jeep to investigate the situation for himself, approaching the bridge the trailer from another jeep was found, which contained the equipment for making smoke, which was then loaded into his own jeep. It was later determined that both officers responsible for the bridge had been injured (one killed), and the sergeant had also been killed, and initial supplies of smoke canisters had been exhausted. Wilkinson proceeded to cross the bridge on foot, under mortar and small arms fire, carrying replacement smoke canisters. He managed to begin the re-establishment of the smoke screen, left the one man still there tending the new smoke canisters, and gathered an additional party of men to ensure the screen was maintained.|$|E

25|$|The 31st Battalion, AIF, {{was formed}} with two {{companies}} from Queensland and two companies from Victoria and concentrated at Broadmeadows in Victoria before departing from Melbourne in October 1915. Initially, it {{was sent to}} Egypt where it {{was involved in the}} defence of the Suez Canal against the Turks, thus earning another battle honour—"Egypt 1915–16". Upon the battalion's arrival in Egypt, the 8th Brigade had been unattached at divisional level, but in early 1916, it was assigned to the 5th Division, after a reorganisation that saw the AIF expanded from two infantry divisions to five. In July 1916 the battalion arrived in France where its first involvement of war on the Western Front was the Battle of Fromelles, during which it suffered over 500 casualties and was so badly mauled that it undertook no more offensive action {{for the rest of the}} year. In 1917, the battalion was involved in the Allied advance towards the Hindenburg Line, although because it was employed mainly in the flank protection role in this time, the only major fighting that it was involved in was at Polygon Wood during the Battle of Passchendaele in the Ypres sector in September 1917. It was here that Private Patrick Joseph Bugden, an original member of the Kennedy Regiment, performed <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>that</b> led to him receiving the Victoria Cross.|$|E
25|$|Lying {{astride the}} border {{separating}} the Union and Confederacy, the Alleghenies {{were among the}} areas most directly affected by the American Civil War (1861–1865). One of the earliest campaigns of the War was fought {{for control of the}} Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike and for the access it provided to the B Railroad. The Battle of Rich Mountain (July 11, 1861) gave the Federals control of the turnpike, of Tygart's Valley, and of all of the territory of western Virginia to the north and west, including the railroad. (Union General George McClellan's victory in this theater would ultimately bring him promotion to commander the Army of the Potomac.) The Federals fortified at Cheat Summit, and the Confederates established strongholds at Camp Bartow and Camp Allegheny. Here they faced each other warily through the fall of 1861 and the following winter. General Robert E. Lee's attempt to attack Cheat Summit Fort (September 12–15, 1861) and Federal attempts to attack Bartow and Allegheny, all failed to change the strategic stalemate. Finally, the harsh, high elevation winter achieved what the troops had failed to accomplish, and in the spring of 1862 both armies moved on down the pike to the Battle of McDowell (May 8, 1862), and then on to fight what became General Stonewall Jackson's Shenandoah Valley Campaign (spring 1862). Two years later, much of this contested area (along with much else) became part of the new state of West Virginia. The very rugged terrain of the Alleghenies was not at all amenable to a large-scale maneuver war and so <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>that</b> the area witnessed {{for the remainder of the}} conflict were generally guerrilla in nature.|$|E
