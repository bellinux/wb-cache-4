5|$|Some of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>contained</b> <b>in</b> the Liber is {{important}} to historians. It is in the Liber that the first statement that Æthelwold translated the Benedictine Rule into Old English is made. The Liber is the longest of the local histories produced in England during the 12th century, and it contains {{a description of the}} royal chancery, which might be the earliest evidence for the existence of that office in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The Liber describes how King Edgar (died 975) granted the abbey the office of chancellor (head of the chancery), but the authenticity of the passage is unclear. The existence of a formal chancery office in Anglo-Saxon England before the Norman Conquest is a matter of some debate amongst historians.|$|E
5|$|Transcription is {{the process}} by which <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>contained</b> <b>in</b> a section of DNA is {{replicated}} {{in the form of a}} newly assembled piece of messenger RNA (mRNA). Enzymes facilitating the process include RNA polymerase and transcription factors. In eukaryotic cells the primary transcript is pre-mRNA. Pre-mRNA must be processed for translation to proceed. Processing includes the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail to the pre-mRNA chain, followed by splicing. Alternative splicing occurs when appropriate, increasing the diversity of the proteins that any single mRNA can produce. The product of the entire transcription process (that began with the production of the pre-mRNA chain) is a mature mRNA chain.|$|E

5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>contained</b> <b>in</b> analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of noise is called additive noise, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E

Another Latin translation of Greek works that was widely copied in the Middle Ages, probably illustrated in the original, was that attributed to Apuleius and this also contained the alternative names for particular plants given in several languages. It dates to about 400 CE and a surviving copy dates to about 600 CE.|$|E

25|$|Parametric and phylogenetic methods draw on {{different}} sources of information; {{it is therefore}} difficult to make general statements about their relative performance. Conceptual arguments can however be invoked. While parametric methods are limited {{to the analysis of}} single or pairs of genomes, phylogenetic methods provide a natural framework to take advantage of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>contained</b> <b>in</b> multiple genomes. In many cases, segments of genomes inferred as HGT based on their anomalous composition can also be recognised as such on the basis of phylogenetic analyses or through their mere absence in genomes of related organisms. In addition, phylogenetic methods rely on explicit models of sequence evolution, which provide a well-understood framework for parameter inference, hypothesis testing, and model selection. This is reflected in the literature, which tends to favour phylogenetic methods as the standard of proof for HGT. The use of phylogenetic methods thus appears to be the preferred standard, especially given that the increase in computational power coupled with algorithmic improvements has made them more tractable, and that the ever denser sampling of genomes lends more power to these tests.|$|E

500|$|Lawyers for The Progressive filed {{a motion}} to vacate the {{decision}} {{on the grounds that}} <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>contained</b> <b>in</b> Morland's article was already in the public domain. The basis for this claim was two reports from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory UCRL-4725, [...] "Weapons Development During June 1956", and UCRL-5280, [...] "Weapons Development During June 1958", which contained detailed information on thermonuclear weapon design. One of them, UCRL-4725, gave details about Bassoon, a three-stage thermonuclear device tested during Operation Redwing in 1956. It was found on the shelves of the Los Alamos library by Dmitri Rotow, a researcher for the American Civil Liberties Union. According to the government, the reports had been inadvertently declassified. On June 15, in 486 F. Supp. 5 (W.D. Wis. 1979), Warren therefore denied the motion on the grounds that such an error did not place the documents in the public domain. The appellants, in [...] 610 F. 2d 819 (7th Cir. 1979), immediately appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, claiming that the two documents had been on the shelves for a considerable period of time. The government now advanced the argument that [...] "technical data" [...] was not protected by the First Amendment. The motions for an expedited review were denied because the magazine's lawyers had waived that right—something Morland and The Progressive editors discovered only from the court. The preliminary injunction therefore remained in effect for six months.|$|E
