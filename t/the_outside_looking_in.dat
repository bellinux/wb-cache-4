5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation {{about the idea of}} re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
5|$|Predictably, the Giants {{struggled}} {{to start the}} season. They were 2–2 when Taylor returned from his suspension. With Taylor back and playing well, however, they won six out of their next eight games. After two straight losses, the Giants won their next three contests {{to set up a}} win-or-go-home game against the Jets in the season finale. The Jets defeated the Giants 27–21. When the Eagles beat the Cowboys, and the 49ers lost to the Rams later that night, the Eagles won the NFC East and the Rams clinched the final Wild Card berth. The Giants finished on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> despite a 10–6 record, because in the tiebreakers, they were swept in the season series by Philadelphia and had a worse conference record than the Rams.|$|E

500|$|In summer 2005, {{the band}} {{received}} a phone call from major label Fueled by Ramen founder John Janick, who wished to see the group perform live. The group had a meeting with Janick, before leaving to record demos in New York City. Eager to hear the material, Janick visited the group while they were recording in late July with Shep Goodman. On November 29, it was announced that the band had signed to Fueled by Ramen. Vocalist Shaant Hacikyan said of the label: [...] "There's such an amazing sense of community about the label. ...

Instead of losing myself in the story, I often felt on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> <b>in,</b> appreciating the craftsmanship, but one step removed from the agony on display.

5000|$|Meyers {{supports}} gay rights. He {{cites the}} New Testament {{story of the}} evangelist Philip baptizing the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts 8: 26-40 as “the most powerful story in the Bible to argue in favor of full inclusion of all people regardless of sexual orientation into the full sacramental hospitality of the Church” because it contradicts the Old Testament law in Deuteronomy 23:1 that rendered a eunuch an outcast. Meyers also contends that the Prophet Isaiah, whom the eunuch was reading while meeting Philip, “is on record as saying even eunuchs will be welcomed into the reign of God because God’s love is unconditional… it is for everyone who is on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> in”. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> debate about {{the place of the}} LGBT community within the Church he describes this story as [...] "the most important and overlooked story in the New Testament". Mayflower Congregational UCC voted unanimously to become an [...] "open and affirming" [...] congregation in 1999. In October 2014 it celebrated 14 wedding ceremonies between same-sex couples on the same day. Meyers told the congregation that [...] "love is a gender-less thing".|$|R

Philip held her as never before. The strength of his arms made her dumb with joy. She could not speak. Her husband led her to the divan and she listened to his voice, his words. She heard him entreat her to forgive, to live anew.|$|R

In March 1957, {{he and his}} brother, Carlos, {{were part of an}} attack on the Presidential Palace of Fulgencio Batista; his brother, Carlos, was killed in that attack. On January 3 of 1959, Eloy and his troops entered the City of Havana, Cuba and few days before Fidel Castro did and Eloy was hailed as one of the Commanders Of The Revolution. Eloy's own army was absorbed into the army of Fidel Castro but Eloy was permitted to retain the rank of 'Major' which was the highest rank in Cuba at the time. However, Eloy and many of his senior officers were never offered a post in the Castro Administration. While being on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> and <b>looking</b> <b>in,</b> Eloy grew dissatified with the Castro Administration and in September-October 1959, Eloy and some of his men from the old 1st Version of the Second National Front - which was formed in 1957 as a pro-Castro group - now form the 2nd Version of the Second National Front - which was an anti-Castro group.|$|R

40|$|This chapter reviews water {{allocation}} {{and management}} in the western United States. It first introduces the region, and then examines the legal and administrative framework for water management and needs for reform. In general, the water rights legislation in the region has favored those who arrived first or who have the economic power to acquire rights later, with little emphasis on community control and proportional sharing, and with large adverse impacts on instream flows and the environment. Water is a tremendously important resource in the western United States. For approximately 150 years, water issues {{have been at the}} core of economic, cultural, and political life in the region. Yet, despite the regional importance of water allocation and management, and the enormous investments in infrastructure and technology, water resource {{management in the}} American West is generally based on laws and policies poorly suited to modern demands. To <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> observer <b>looking</b> <b>in,</b> <b>the</b> region offers a wealth of lessons—perhaps more negative than positive. This chapter reviews water allocation and management in the American West. It begins with an overview of the region, which despite its aridity features extensive agricultural production and rapid population growth. Next, the legal and administrative framework for water management is examined, focusing primarily on the prior appropriation doctrine of water allocation. This leads to a discussion of the region’s most pressing management issues, and the opportunities for, and constraints to, meaningful reform...|$|R
60|$|Right {{in front}} of him was the broad window of the chamber, with the moon shining brightly through it. For an instant {{something}} had obscured the light, and now a head was bobbing up and down <b>outside,</b> <b>the</b> face <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> at him, and swinging slowly {{from one side of the}} window to the other. Even in that dim light there could be no mistaking those features. Drawn, distorted and blood-stained, they were still those of the young fellow-squire who had sat so recently upon his own couch. With a cry of horror Alleyne sprang from his bed and rushed to the casement, while the two archers, aroused by the sound, seized their weapons and stared about them in bewilderment. One glance was enough to show Edricson that his fears were but too true. Foully murdered, with a score of wounds upon him and a rope round his neck, his poor friend had been cast from the upper window and swung slowly in the night wind, his body rasping against the wall and his disfigured face upon a level with the casement.|$|R

She stood silent for a moment, then walked {{suddenly}} away, and falling on her uncle's chair, fairly burst out sobbing. Denis was in the acme of embarrassment. He looked round, as if to seek for inspiration, and seeing a stool, plumped down upon it for something to do. There he sat, playing with the guard of his rapier, and wishing himself dead a thousand times over, and buried in the nastiest kitchen-heap in France. His eyes wandered round the apartment, but found nothing to arrest them. There were such wide spaces between the furniture, the light fell so baldly and cheerlessly over all, <b>the</b> dark <b>outside</b> air <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> so coldly through the windows, that he thought he had never seen a church so vast nor a tomb so melancholy. The regular sobs of Blanche de Malétroit measured out the time like the ticking of a clock. He read the device upon the shield over and over again, until his eyes became obscured; he stared into shadowy corners until he imagined they were swarming with horrible animals; and every now and again he awoke with a start, to remember that his last two hours were running, and death was on the march.|$|R

500|$|... "Sardines" [...] {{was written}} {{so that a}} feeling of {{claustrophobia}} would develop as the story progressed; Pemberton said that [...] "our first consideration was, 'Can we get 12 people in a wardrobe?' So when we did the script read-through, the designer bought a wardrobe off eBay and we checked whether we could all get in it and shut the door". Writers for Broadcast described seeing the assortment of actors [...] "crammed inside an imposing wardrobe" [...] during filming as [...] "an arresting spectacle". The story is filmed from within a single bedroom, with much of it taking place inside the wardrobe. Filming presented a particular challenge, as {{the aim was to}} give the impression that the viewer was in the wardrobe with the characters, and not to [...] "cheat" [...] by giving the impression that <b>the</b> viewer was <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> wardrobe <b>looking</b> <b>in.</b> The episode was filmed with two wardrobes; one complete one, and one [...] "faked" [...] one. The complete prop was used to film the characters entering the wardrobe, while the other was in a different room for close-up shots from [...] "within" [...] the wardrobe. For director David Kerr, the difficulty was sustaining the illusion that everything was happening in a single place, ideally without viewers even realising that there was a technical challenge involved. The episode was filmed mostly in sequence, meaning more actors arrived as the filming continued, reflecting the fact that more characters arrive as the episode progresses. Kerr aimed for a particularly [...] "immersive" [...] filming style on the episode, with extensive use of wide angle shots. He aimed to avoid [...] "leading" [...] the audience with regards to the more important characters, by, for instance, [...] "not giving [...] coverage" [...] earlier in the episode.|$|R
