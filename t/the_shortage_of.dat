5|$|Criticisms of Abercrombie {{begin with}} his {{reliance}} on relatively poor intelligence. Reports reached {{him that the}} French strength at Carillon was 6,000, and that a further 3,000 were expected. Many of these reports were from French deserters or captives, and Abercrombie should have investigated them by sending out scouts or light infantry. Even if the reports were accurate, Abercrombie's army still significantly outnumbered that of Montcalm. The same sources must also have reported <b>the</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> provisions at the fort, a sign that a siege would have ended quickly.|$|E
5|$|Enlisted sailors {{during this}} time {{included}} many foreign-born men, and native-born Americans were usually social outcasts who had few other employment options or {{they were trying to}} escape punishment for crimes. In 1835, almost 3,000men sailed with merchant ships out of Boston harbor, but only 90men were recruited by the Navy. It was unlawful for black men to serve in the Navy, but <b>the</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> men was so acute this law was frequently ignored.|$|E

One analyst suggests the poor performance of Japanese auditors may be due to low pay, and overwork due to <b>the</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> certified public accountants: audit fees are up to one-fifth of that of comparable US companies; there are 17,000 CPAs in Japan, compared with 330,000 in the US.|$|E
5|$|In 1842, <b>the</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> {{pig iron}} persuaded Bell to install its own blast furnace for {{smelting}} mill cinder; {{this was a}} key decision, enabling the firm to expand. Only two years later, in 1844, the firm installed a second furnace at Walker for Cleveland Ironstone from Grosmont, six years before the boom in Cleveland iron when Vaughan and Marley discovered ironstone in the Eston Hills in 1850. From 1849, Losh, Wilson and Bell were subcontractors on the Newcastle-Gateshead High Level Bridge, responsible for constructing the bridge approaches.|$|E

He was unhappy with being a field musician because he had joined the Marine Corps to fight. He applied for a change in rating to be a machine-gunner, but was refused due to <b>the</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> buglers. After completing field music school, he was transferred to the 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division.|$|E

5|$|The {{reintegration}} of French prisoners into {{civilian life}} was facilitated by {{a network of}} Maisons du Prisonnier (Prisoner Houses), established across France, which would help them readjust and find work. Generally, prisoners generally found it easy to regain their pre-war jobs because of <b>the</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> labour. The government had hoped that returning prisoners of war would be more sympathetic to the Vichy regime, but prisoners coming back were not noticeably more loyal to Vichy than other groups.|$|E

When his unit moved to California he again asked for relief as a field musician; and for permission to perform line duties. Again, due to <b>the</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> buglers in the Marine Corps, his request was denied.
