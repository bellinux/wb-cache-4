5|$|The final death {{scene in}} Tenebrae – where Neal is accidentally impaled by a {{sculpture}} – is directly referenced in Kenneth Branagh's Hitchcockian murder mystery Dead Again (1991). Kim Newman maintains that Branagh's film imitates the sequence so entirely – with Derek Jacobi being pierced by the sculpture – that Branagh must {{have included the}} reference deliberately. The subsequent moment, where Nicolodi screams repeatedly in <b>the</b> <b>rain,</b> <b>was</b> cited by Asia Argento (Nicolodi's daughter with Dario Argento) as the moment that inspired her to become an actress.|$|E
5|$|Moondram Pirai {{was shot}} in Ketti, a small town {{situated}} close to Ooty. Shooting also took place in Bangalore. A total of 30 days was taken to complete the filming on 36,000 feet of film negative. Mahendra did not find hiring a train expensive at that time; as a result, he hired a train for the film's scene where Haasan and Sridevi depart for Ketti, and another train for the film's climax which was shot at the Ketti railway station. Although it was raining {{on the day the}} climax was shot, Mahendra decided to continue shooting the scene even though <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>was</b> not part of the film's script. In the post-production phase, Smitha's voice was dubbed by Anuradha. Mahendra supervised Anuradha's dubbing session and taught her the methods to emote the dialogues for Smitha in the film.|$|E

5|$|On September1, the Venezuelan tanker Acosta relayed an SOS signal while {{near the}} {{hurricane}} 200mi (320km) {{southeast of the}} Frying Pan Shoals. United States Coast Guard stations in Norfolk, Virginia and Morehead City, North Carolina dispatched cutters to aid the ship. Off of the East Coast, {{an offshoot of the}} hurricane resulted in the drownings of two people. In the Mid-Atlantic states, the passing hurricane's outflow interacted with a cold front that had become quasi-stationary over the area. The cyclone's flow pattern enhanced the moisture environment over the region, resulting in locally heavy rainfall, particularly in New Jersey, where precipitation peaked at 24in (610mm) in Ewan in a nine-hour period on September1. This would make the hurricane the wettest tropical cyclone in state history. Most of <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>was</b> in western portions of the state, however, with minimal rainfall at the coast. The floods caused small rivers to overflow, breaching dams. An overflowed creek inundated parts of Lumberton Township, rendering 2,000people homeless. Rail service between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and areas of southern New Jersey was suspended as a result of washed out tracks. Resulting damage to infrastructure totaled $4,000,000in the southwestern quarter of New Jersey alone. Damage to roads in Burlington County amounted to $2,500,000. In Camden County, damage was estimated at $1million. Four fatalities were reported {{as a result of the}} floods. In Delaware, rainfall was comparatively less. However, rough seas generated by the hurricane offshore caused $50,000 in damages and one death. Further north, strong gusts were reported across New England. Winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) were recorded by a weather station in Nantucket. Peak winds in Massachusetts were estimated at 65 mph (100 km/h). In Eastport, Maine, winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) were reported.|$|E

On Day 4, Joe Root made 58 and Ben Cutting was the pick of the bowlers. England finally put Australia A out of their misery and declared at 7-430. Only 31 overs were bowled as Alex Doolan made 31 as another tour match went down as a draw.|$|E

25|$|On the 16th, {{warm air}} picking up {{moisture}} – due to residual {{heat from the}} Atlantic Ocean – travelled towards the South West Cornish coast as prevailing winds. Upon contact with the topographically vertical coast, these winds experienced a strong up-drafting force thus causing internal moisture to reach the atmosphere, and consequently cool as a string of storm clouds. With convergence and coalescence, enhanced moisture levels resulted in heavy rainfall {{on the afternoon of}} 16 August 2004. 185mm (7inches) of rain fell over the high ground just inland of Boscastle. At the peak of the downpour, at about 15:40 GMT, 24.1mm of rain (almost one inch) was recorded as falling in just 15 minutes at Lesnewth, 2.5 miles (4km) up the valley from Boscastle. In Boscastle, 89mm (3.5inches) of rain was recorded in 60 minutes. <b>The</b> <b>rain</b> <b>was</b> very localised: Otterham and Lesnewth, both a few miles inland from Boscastle, recorded 24 hour totals of 200mm and 185mm respectively on the day, whereas four of the nearest 10 rain gauges showed less than 3mm of rain in the same period. The cause of the very heavy localised rain is thought to be an extreme example of what has become known as the Brown Willy effect.|$|E

500|$|The {{northern}} {{side of the}} Thames was {{the more}} populous, housing two-thirds of London's population, and the works had to proceed through congested streets and overcome such urban hurdles as canals, bridges and railway lines. [...] Work began on the system on 31 January 1859, but the builders encountered numerous problems in construction, including a labourers' strike in 1859–60, hard frosts in winter, and heavier than normal rainfall. <b>The</b> <b>rain</b> <b>was</b> so heavy in June 1862 that an accident occurred at the works re-building the Fleet sewer.

500|$|Thomas {{called the}} scene in which Keith makes Veronica dinner [...] "quintessential Keith" [...] and {{indicative}} of his lasting commitment to his daughter.

SFX reviewer David Bradley also reacted positively, giving the episode four out of five stars. He assessed it as [...] "better structured, funnier and more absorbing" [...] than the previous single episode [...] "Victory of the Daleks" [...] and praised the comedy and acting of Alex Price.

She shows O'Malley papers stored in the arsenal which reveal how Forrest (backed by secretive, ultra-wealthy, power-hungry individuals) planned to use racism, anti-union feeling, and antisemitism to divide the country, turning one group against another if it became too powerful to control, in order to create the chaos that would let him seize power. Christine discovered the plot the day before her husband's death. She went riding the next morning and came upon the washed-out bridge.

The winds broke the record of 210km/h (130mph) set by Typhoon Prapiroon in 2000, and the pressure was 1.5mbar lower than that during Typhoon Sarah in 1959, {{which was one of}} the strongest storms to strike South Korea after Maemi. On the South Korean mainland, the Pusan International Airport reported wind gusts of 143km/h (89mph). Winds in Busan reached 154km/h (96mph), the second-highest wind speed for the city after Typhoon Thelma in 1987. Due to high winds, five nuclear power plants were shut down automatically, but were ultimately unaffected.|$|E
