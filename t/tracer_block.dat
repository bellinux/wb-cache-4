The phenotypes of Rme- 8 mutants bear a strong resemblance to those of Hsc 70 - 4, suggesting that these two genes act in a common pathway. Indeed, biochemical and genetic data demonstrated that Rme- 8 interacts specifically with Hsc 70 - 4 via its J-domain. Thus, Rme- 8 appears to function as an unexpected but critical cochaperone with Hsc 70 in endocytosis. Because Hsc 70 is known to act in clathrin uncoating along with auxilin, another J-protein, its interaction with Rme- 8 indicates that Hsc 70 can act with multiple cofactors, possibly explaining its pleiotropic effects on the endocytic pathway...|$|R

This study used a &ldquo;tracer&rdquo; cell model to mimic low frequency abnormal cells and compare detection and representative sampling with simple sedimentation, Richard-Allan HistoGel&trade;, and Cellient cell <b>block</b> techniques. Methods: <b>Tracer</b> cells were a cultured cell line (CaSki) fixed in methanol, prestained in solution with hematoxylin, and quantified using a hemacytometer. Tracer cells were diluted in a 10 -fold dilution series ranging from 100 to 0. 1 tracer/mL in a background of pooled clinical serous effusion specimens. Ten replicates of each dilution were processed using each cell block method, and the resulting blocks were cut to produce two slides from each block. The slides were deparaffinized, counterstained with eosin, cover-slipped, and screened {{for the presence of}} <b>tracer</b> cells. <b>Blocks</b> were considered to be representative of the specimen if tracer cells were detected on either of the slides. If no tracer cells were observed on either slide, the block was recut to generate a third slide. If tracer cells were seen on the third slide, the block was considered representative of the specimen. Results: Tracer cells were identified on the initial slides for 20 of 40 (50. 0 %) simple sedimentation, 21 of 40 (52. 5 %) of HistoGel, and 25 of 40 (62. 5 %) of Cellient cell blocks. Representative sampling of the 1 tracer/mL specimen was 10. 0 % for simple sedimentation and 30. 0 % for HistoGel and Cellient.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Imaging of gene {{expression}} with {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) {{has emerged as a}} powerful tool for biomedical research during the last decade. The prototypical herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV 1 -TK) PET reporter gene (PRG) is widely used and many other PRGs have also been validated. We investigated varicella zoster virus thymidine kinase (VZV-tk) as new PRG with radiolabeled bicyclic nucleoside analogues (BCNAs) as PET tracers. METHODS: The uptake and washout of four different radiolabeled BCNAs was evaluated in cells expressing VZV-tk after lentiviral vector (LV) transduction and in control cells. Metabolism of the tracers was assayed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Mice bearing VZV-TK expressing xenografts were imaged with PET. RESULTS: High uptake in VZV-tk expressing cells was seen for 3 of the 4 tracers tested. The uptake of the <b>tracers</b> could be <b>blocked</b> by the presence of excess thymidine in the incubation solution. Cellular retention was variable, with one tracer showing an acceptable half-life of ~ 1 hour. The amount of intracellular tracer correlated with the titer of LV used to transduce the cells. VZV-TK dependent conversion into metabolites was shown by HPLC. No specific accumulation was observed in cells expressing a fusion protein containing an HSV 1 -TK moiety. VZV-tk expression in xenografts resulted in a 60 % increase in uptake in vivo as measured with PET. CONCLUSIONS: We have validated the combination of VZV-tk and radiolabeled BCNAs as new PRG/PRP system. Further optimization of the PRPs and the PRG are warranted to increase the signal. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A complex tracer mixture was {{injected}} continuously {{for over}} two years into a 10 m x 10 m x 7 m block of unsaturated tuff as part of the Busted Butte unsaturated-zone tracer test at Yucca Mountain. The test was designed to measure tracer transport within the Topopah Springs and Calico Hills tuffs, units that occur between the potential high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain and the water table below. The mixture included nonreactive (Br, I, and fluorinated benzoic acids (FBAs)) and reactive tracers (Li, Ce, Sm, Ni, Co, and Mn). Bromide, I, FBAs, and Li were detected during the test on absorbent pads emplaced in a series of solute collection boreholes located beneath the injectors but the more strongly sorbing metals did not reach the collection boreholes during this period. To determine the distribution and mobility of these metals, tracer constituents were extracted from tuff samples collected during overcoring and mineback of the test <b>block.</b> <b>Tracers</b> were extracted from the tuff samples by leaching with a 5 % nitric acid solution for metals and a bicarbonate-carbonate buffer for anions. Results from the overcore sample suite show that metals have migrated through the tuff in the region adjacent to and immediately below the tracer injectors. Consistent with laboratory sorption measurements and observed breakthrough in the collection boreholes, rock analyses showed that Li is the most mobile of the metals. Co and Ni behave similarly, traveling tens of cm from the injection sites, while Sm and Ce moved far less, possibly due to precipitation reactions in addition to sorption. Determination of Mn transport is complicated by high background concentrations in the tuff; additional background samples are currently being evaluated. As expected, the rock analyses show that the nonreactive tracers Br and FBAs have moved beyond the overcore region, corroborating results from collection boreholes...|$|R
40|$|HIDAC, offers {{submillimeter}} {{resolution in}} instrumental charac-terization experiments. The {{aim of this}} study was to establish the tomograph’s utility in a biologic application and to demon-strate the feasibility of rapid dynamic neuroreceptor imaging in mice. Methods: We used the well-established, high-affinity do-pamine D 2 receptor PET ligand 18 F-fallypride for imaging striatal D 2 receptors in NMRI mice. Dynamic PET data were acquired using the quad-HIDAC tomograph and subject to 2 different kinetic modeling approaches. The cerebellum, a brain region devoid of D 2 receptors, was chosen as a reference region for kinetic modeling. Results: The resolution of the quad-HIDAC camera allowed clear visualization of the left and right mouse striatum with high target-to-nontarget signal ratios. The sensi-tivity of the tomograph permitted the generation of time–activity curves with initial time frames of 120 s. PET experiments ac-quiring data for 150 min demonstrated that the binding potential of 18 F-fallypride could be fitted robustly with both reference tissue models for scan durations of 40 min. Voxel-wise mod-eling resulted in parametric maps of high quality. The values for the binding potential in the striatum reached approximately 14, consistent with striatum-to-cerebellum ratios extracted from regional time–activity curves. Comparison of in vivo PET imag-ing results with ex vivo postmortem tissue sampling analyses indicated discrepancies in signal intensity, possibly resulting from scatter and random background in the cerebellum region of interest and leading to an overestimation of cerebellar activity concentrations and degradation of striatum-to-cerebellum ra-tios in PET experiments. Intraperitoneal injection of the unla-beled D 2 receptor antagonist haloperidol 30 min before intrave-nous injection of 18 F-fallypride <b>blocked</b> <b>tracer</b> accumulation in the striatum by 95 %.

40|$|Activation of {{adenosine}} A(1) receptors (A(1) R) in {{the brain}} causes sedation, reduces anxiety, inhibits seizures, and promotes neuroprotection. Cerebral A(1) R can be visualized using 8 -dicyclopropylmethyl- 1 -(11) C-methyl- 3 -propyl-xanthine ((11) C-MPDX) and PET. This study aims to test whether (11) C-MPDX {{can be used for}} quantitative studies of cerebral A 1 R in rodents. Methods: (11) C-MPDX was injected (intravenously) into isoflurane-anesthetized male Wistar rats (300 g). A dynamic scan of the central nervous system was obtained, using a small-animal PET camera. A cannula in a femoral artery was used for blood sampling. Three groups of animals were studied: group 1, controls (saline-treated); group 2, animals pretreated with the A(1) R antagonist 8 -cyclopentyl- 1, 3 -dipropylxanthine (DPCPX, 1 mg, intraperitoneally); and group 3, animals pretreated (intraperitoneally) with a 20 % solution of ethanol in saline (2 mL) plus the adenosine kinase inhibitor 4 -amino- 5 -(3 -bromophenyl) - 7 -(6 -morpholino-pyridin- 3 -yl) pyrido [2, 3 -d] pyrimidine dihydrochloride (ABT- 702) (1 mg). DPCPX is known to occupy cerebral A 1 R, whereas ethanol and ABT- 702 increase extracellular adenosine. Results: In groups 1 and 3, the brain was clearly visualized. High uptake of (11) C-MPDX was noted in striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum. In group 2, tracer uptake was strongly suppressed and regional differences were abolished. The treatment of group 3 resulted in an unexpected 40 %- 45 % increase of the cerebral uptake of radioactivity as indicated by increases of PET standardized uptake value, distribution volume from Logan plot, nondisplaceable binding potential from 2 -tissue-compartment model fit, and standardized uptake value from a biodistribution study performed after the PET scan. The partition coefficient of the tracer (K(1) /k(2) from the model fit) was not altered under the study conditions. Conclusion: (11) C-MPDX shows a regional distribution in rat brain consistent with binding to A(1) R. <b>Tracer</b> binding is <b>blocked</b> by the selective A(1) R antagonist DPCPX. Pretreatment of animals with ethanol and adenosine kinase inhibitor increases (11) C-MPDX uptake. This increase may reflect an increased availability of A(1) R after acute exposure to ethanol...|$|R
