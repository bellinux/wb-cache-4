5|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> reacted inappropriately when {{departure}} clearance was ordered by ATC.|$|E
5|$|After the deicing {{truck was}} repaired, the pilot {{requested}} a second deicing, though <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> {{did not perform}} a walkaround of their airplane, and USAir procedures did not require them to do so. Following the second deicing, LaGuardia ground control granted Flight 405 permission to taxi to Runway 13. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> completed the pre-flight checklist during the taxi.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> was criticised for not {{maintaining}} a sterile cockpit during the landing, with excessive non-flight related discussion going on throughout the flight.|$|E
50|$|Contributing to the {{accident}} were (1) <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew’s</b> failure to monitor airspeed {{in relation to}} the rising position of the low-speed cue, (2) <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew’s</b> failure to adhere to sterile cockpit procedures, (3) the captain’s failure to effectively manage <b>the</b> <b>flight,</b> and (4) Colgan Air’s inadequate procedures for airspeed selection and management during approaches in icing conditions.|$|R
5000|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> mismanagement of <b>the</b> airplane's descent during the visual approach, the pilot flying's unintended deactivation of automatic airspeed control, <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> inadequate monitoring of airspeed, and <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> delayed execution of a go-around after they became aware that the airplane was below acceptable glidepath and airspeed tolerances. Contributing to the accident were (1) {{the complexities of the}} autothrottle and autopilot flight director systems that were inadequately described in Boeing's documentation and Asiana's pilot training, which increased the likelihood of mode error; (2) <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> nonstandard communication and coordination regarding the use of the autothrottle and autopilot flight director systems; (3) the pilot flying's inadequate training on the planning and executing of visual approaches; (4) the pilot monitoring/instructor pilot's inadequate supervision of the pilot flying; and (5) <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> fatigue, which likely degraded their performance.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> {{execution}} of <b>the</b> GPWS escape maneuver while the speedbrakes remained deployed.|$|R
5|$|Unusually for an {{aircraft}} accident investigation, the investigative committee was not provided {{information as to}} the identities of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|As the {{aircraft}} climbed, No. 1 engine {{on the port}} wing developed a fuel leak. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> responded by shutting down the engine and feathering its propeller. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> declared an emergency and requested a blind approach to RAF Abingdon. The controller alerted emergency services on the ground. A short time later, cockpit instruments alerted <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> to a large loss of fuel from No. 2 fuel tank, the second of four such tanks in the port wing. In an effort to stop the leak, the crew de-activated the fuel cocks and boosters for the No. 2 tank, but left them on for the No. 1 tank. As the Beverley turned on to final approach for RAF Abingdon the crew attempted to increase power from the remaining three Bristol Centaurus engines but No. 2 engine – also on the port wing – failed to respond and {{the aircraft}} began to lose speed and height.|$|E
5|$|Its design also {{included}} a full glass cockpit rather than the hybrid versions found in previous airliners. The A320's flight deck is equipped with Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) with side-stick controllers. The A320 features an Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) which gives <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> information about all the systems of the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> {{decision}} to continue {{an approach to}} an area where a microburst was likely.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the crash was {{determined}} to be <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> failure to maintain <b>the</b> minimum <b>flight</b> altitude.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> ongoing {{efforts to}} {{expedite}} their {{approach and landing}} {{in order to avoid}} potential delays.|$|R
5|$|The Safety Board {{believes}} that <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> of Flight 405 {{should have taken}} more positive steps to assure a contamination-free wing, such as entering the cabin {{to look at the}} wing from a closer range. Although the Safety Board acknowledges that the detection of minimal amounts of contamination, sufficient to cause aerodynamic performance problems, is difficult and may not be possible without a tactile inspection, an observation from the cabin would have improved the chance of seeing some contamination and might have prompted <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> to return to the gate. The Safety Board {{believes that}} the flight crew’s failure to take such precautions and the decision to attempt takeoff while unsure of wing cleanliness led to this accident and is a cause of it.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{service members}} {{continued}} the hoax, with Burdell's name appearing on various fronts. For example, he was listed on <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> of a B-17 bomber, flying twelve missions over Europe with the 8th Air Force in England, until a Georgia Tech graduate became the new operations officer, recognized {{the name on}} the flight log, and ended the charade.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{added that}} {{the design of the}} Embraer's {{avionics}} is such that the non-functioning of the TCAS that apparently occurred is shown by a small static white text message, which may not be noticeable by <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew.</b> The NTSB noted:Using only static text messages to indicate a loss of collision avoidance system functionality is not a reliable means to capture pilots' attention because these visual warnings can be easily overlooked if their attention is directed elsewhere in the flight environment.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crews</b> {{decided to}} {{go-around}}, {{but then they}} later aborted the go-around and continued their approach.|$|R

5|$|The {{flight was}} {{operated}} {{for the purpose}} of maintaining the currency of the instrument rating of two of the airline's pilots. Shortly after takeoff and only seconds after climbing through , the plane began banking to the right. It continued to roll through 90degrees; the nose then dropped suddenly and moments later it struck the ground. All three members of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> were killed upon impact.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed the aircraft had impacted birds during take-off. Due to loss {{of power in the}} left engine, <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> were unable to control their aircraft before it struck the roof of the apartment building. The investigation further determined the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and officials at DeKalb–Peachtree Airport were aware of the danger of birds at the airport after a landfill site had opened {{in the vicinity of the}} airport ten years before the accident.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of the}} crew pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|E
50|$|In 1982, Adria {{got a new}} {{leadership}} which focused on the education of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crews,</b> technical staff and other professional personnel {{as well as on}} ensuring safety.|$|R

5000|$|... 24 November 2006, an A310 descended {{significantly}} below cleared altitude during radar vectored approach positioning, as {{a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> failure to set the QNH, which was very low.|$|R
5|$|On 31 March 1972, B-52D AF Ser. No. 56-0625, {{departed}} McCoy Air Force Base, Florida on {{a routine}} training mission. Assigned to the 306th Bombardment Wing, the unarmed aircraft sustained multiple engine failures and engine fires on engines No.7 and No.8 shortly after takeoff. The aircraft immediately attempted {{to return to the}} base, but crashed just short of Runway 18R in a residential area of Orlando, Florida, approximately 1 mile north of McCoy AFB, destroying or damaging eight homes. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> of 7 airmen and 1 civilian on the ground were killed.|$|E
5|$|On February 26, 1973, {{a private}} Learjet 24 crashed shortly after {{take-off}} from DeKalb–Peachtree Airport in Chamblee, Georgia, United States. The aircraft, registration N454RN, {{owned by a}} private corporation, struck birds shortly after lifting off. Air traffic control advised <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> of smoke trailing from their left engine; the crew {{said they would not}} be able to return to the airport. The aircraft impacted the roof of an apartment building and came to rest in a ravine. All five passengers and two crew members aboard the aircraft were killed; a person in the apartment building suffered severe burns.|$|E
5|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> members' failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane's location on the airport surface during taxi and their failure to cross-check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's nonpertinent conversations during taxi, {{which resulted in a}} loss of positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration's failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances.|$|E

5|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> operation of <b>the</b> airplane below the minimum descent altitude without an appropriate visual reference for the runway.|$|R
5000|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} causes of this accident were <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> failure to discontinue the approach when severe thunderstorms and their associated hazards to flight operations {{had moved into}} the airport area and the crew's failure {{to ensure that the}} spoilers had extended after touchdown.Contributing to the accident were <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> (1) impaired performance resulting from fatigue and the situational stress associated with the intent to land under the circumstances, (2) continuation of the approach to a landing when the company's maximum crosswind component was exceeded, and (3) use of reverse thrust greater than 1.3 engine pressure ratio after landing.|$|R
5|$|The Peruvian {{government}} {{investigated the}} accident, {{and in its}} final report concluded that the probable cause of the accident was the improper execution of engine-out procedures by <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew,</b> with contributing factors of improper loading of the aircraft and improper maintenance procedures by company personnel. There was also evidence of a coverup and falsification of critical maintenance records by LANSA employees during the investigation process. The Peruvian government subsequently fined LANSA {{and some of its}} employees, and suspended the airline's operating license for 90 days as a consequence.|$|E
5|$|United Airlines {{issued a}} {{statement}} saying it had begun installing the device on its fleet of DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft one week before the accident, having used it successfully in service on their fleet of Douglas DC-7 aircraft. A Martin bar had not yet been fitted on Mainliner Idaho. United Airlines also said a program had begun to install reverse thrust indicator lights on all their DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft. The signals, fitted in the cockpit of the aircraft, would have warned <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> that the thrust lever had been pulled back too far, and the propellers had been reversed.|$|E
5|$|Captain Cliff Taylor and Acting First Officer John Hutchinson {{had managed}} to safely land their {{aircraft}} which, having lost an engine, was on fire carrying about 22,000 gallons of fuel, in the most testing of circumstances and almost certainly saved 121 lives. Taylor was recommended for an award by BOAC, but following {{the publication of the}} official inquiry report in August 1969, the decision was taken at ministerial level not to recognise any member of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew.</b> Both Taylor and Hutchinson received, along with First Officer Francis Kirkland and Check Captain Geoffrey Moss, but not Flight Engineer Thomas Hicks, commendations from BOAC, and Captain Taylor was awarded the British Airline Pilots Association Gold Medal.|$|E
50|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) who concluded that the plane crashed due to <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> failure to maintain terrain clearance, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain in instrument meteorological conditions.|$|R
50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{determined}} the probable {{cause of the}} accident was <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> tardy identification of microburst-induced wind shear. Other factors included poor visibility {{and a lack of}} altitude and airspeed callouts by the aircrew.|$|R
5000|$|The NTSB {{issued the}} {{following}} official Probable Cause statement for <b>the</b> accident: <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> lack of altitude awareness at critical points during the approach due to poor cockpit discipline {{in that the}} crew did not follow prescribed procedure.|$|R
