From {{the end of}} October to mid-November, Poe Evermore, a storytelling event based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe is held. Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, Victorian Christmas or A Dickens of a Christmas, <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> the story of A Christmas Carol, is performed.|$|E
25|$|There are {{at least}} four key moments in <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> the events {{surrounding}} the foundation of Thanet Abbey, and the emphasis and purpose of the story changes substantially to suit the needs {{of each of these}} contexts.|$|E
25|$|Authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and Oscar Wilde (in The Picture of Dorian Gray) also {{developed}} fantasy, in <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> horror tales, a separate branch of fantasy {{that was to}} have great influence on H. P. Lovecraft and other writers of dark fantasy. Wilde also wrote {{a large number of}} children's fantasies, collected in The Happy Prince and Other Stories (1888) and A House of Pomegranates (1891).|$|E

25|$|Episodes with {{dialogue}} {{from the}} Ramayana are enacted using painted {{figures of the}} characters in profile, which strongly resemble the 18th-century Indian tradition of Rajput painting. The Rajput style of brush painting was principally enacted on manuscripts and commonly employed in <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> epics such as the Ramayana. In the film they serve as a more traditional style of dramatic narrative, although the dialogue is frequently ironic, inappropriately modern or otherwise humorous.|$|E
25|$|Symbolism {{plays an}} {{enduring}} role in <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> a story through painting or other Chinese art. For instance, {{stars and the}} moon are important both for religious significance and as an illustration of Chinese mythology. Symbols used in art may be grouped into four overarching categories: religious imagery, divine and mortal beings, symbols from nature and inanimate objects. Some examples of symbols include bats which means both good wishes and good luck. The moon, aside from religious and mythical connotations, can also mean a month. The particular way an image is depicted has meaning - like a round eyed-cat means it's a night scene.|$|E
25|$|Storytelling in {{indigenous}} cultures {{is sometimes}} passed on by oral means {{in a quiet}} and relaxing environment, which usually coincides with family or tribal community gatherings and official events such as family occasions, rituals, or ceremonial practices. During <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> the story, children may act as participants by asking questions, acting out the story, or telling smaller parts of the story. Furthermore, stories are not often told {{in the same manner}} twice, resulting in many variations of a single myth. This is because narrators may choose to insert new elements into old stories dependent upon the relationship between the storyteller and the audience, making the story correspond to each unique situation.|$|E

50|$|Then one night, the man {{dreams of}} the dream-city Zakarion, in which he finds a yellowed papyrus written by wise dream-sages who exist only within the dream world. <b>The</b> papyrus <b>tells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gate, with varying {{accounts}} of what lies beyond: some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dream-sages <b>tell</b> <b>of</b> immense wonders, while others <b>tell</b> <b>of</b> horror and disappointment.|$|R

25|$|By AD 8, he had {{completed}} his most ambitious work, the Metamorphoses, a hexameter epic poem in 15 books. The work encyclopedically catalogues transformations in Greek and Roman mythology, from {{the emergence of}} the cosmos to the apotheosis of Julius Caesar. The stories follow each other in <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> human beings transformed to new bodies: trees, rocks, animals, flowers, constellations etc. At the same time, he worked on the Fasti, a six-book poem in elegiac couplets on the theme of the calendar of Roman festivals and astronomy. The composition of this poem was interrupted by Ovid's exile, and it is thought that Ovid abandoned work on the piece in Tomis. It is probably in this period, if they are indeed by Ovid, that the double letters (16–21) in the Heroides were composed.|$|E
500|$|According to Adler, Anderson had [...] "a very poetic way {{of looking}} at the world". Alison Harlow had {{informed}} her that Anderson's claims about his origins often changed, with Doyle White commenting that [...] "Anderson believed that <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> spiritual 'truths' through stories was more important than factual accounts of the past".|$|E
500|$|Catch Me if You Can {{deals with}} themes of broken homes and troubled childhoods. Spielberg's parents {{divorced}} {{when he was}} a teenager, similar to Frank Abagnale's situation. In the film, Carl Hanratty is also divorced from his wife, who lives with their daughter in Chicago. [...] "Some of my films have had to do with broken homes and people on the run from their sad pasts", Spielberg stated. [...] "But there are those strands that got me to say: you know, there's something also about me that I can say through <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> this kind of lighthearted story".|$|E

500|$|Eddie Condon, Hoagy Carmichael, and Mezz Mezzrow, {{all of whom}} hyperbolically {{raved about}} his playing, also saw Beiderbecke play live or {{performed}} alongside him. Condon, for instance, wrote of being amazed by Beiderbecke's piano playing: [...] "All my life I had been listening to music [...] But I had never heard anything remotely like what Beiderbecke played. For the first time I realized music isn't all the same, it had become an entirely new set of sounds" [...] "I tried to explain Bix to the gang," [...] Carmichael wrote, but [...] "t was no good, like <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> a vivid, personal dream [...] the emotion couldn't be transmitted." ...|$|E
500|$|Brannon Braga {{wrote the}} story from the initial idea of the Doctor having an {{identity}} crisis, [...] "What if the doctor discovers that Voyager is a hologram and he is real?" [...] From there, Braga questioned the axiom [...] "I think, therefore I am" [...] {{and what it means}} to be [...] "real". [...] Calling it a [...] "creepy, philosophical quandary", Braga related the story of [...] "Projections" [...] to the work of René Descartes, where [...] "the [...] plagued by an evil demon out to prove he doesn't exist"; in this instance, Braga made Barclay (Schultz) the demon. [...] The episode was written to keep the viewer guessing as to which reality was true; Braga would later say that the fun of the episode wasn't in the story itself, but in <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> the story, [...] "in considering all the different twists and turns along the way." ...|$|E
500|$|The bridge set {{was moved}} from Stage 6 {{to the larger}} Stage 8 on the Paramount lot between season 1 and 2, {{and in the process}} was re-assembled {{slightly}} asymmetrically, an error no one noticed despite remaining that way {{through the rest of the}} series. Other modifications made to the bridge set included redesigned rear bridge stations so that LeVar Burton's character Geordi La Forge, in his new role as Chief Engineer, could have a work station on the bridge, and modifications to several chairs to fit the actors better. A viewscreen was added to the observation lounge and a new set was created to represent the Ten-Forward lounge. The lounge was the final set to be designed for The Next Generation by Herman Zimmerman. He explained that [...] "Ten-Forward became the place where ordinary crew and the officers could co-mingle, and where aliens who were not allowed on the bridge could interact with other crew-members. It was a very important set for <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> stories." ...|$|E

50|$|Manhunters was {{a three-part}} TV Drama Series that aired on BBC Two in the United Kingdom in 2005. It <b>tells</b> <b>the</b> story <b>of</b> three cases of man-eaters through the memoirs {{of those who}} hunted them and, {{in the case of}} the third episode, accidentally {{unleashed}} them on their community. <b>The</b> first <b>tells</b> <b>the</b> story <b>of</b> Jim Corbett, played by Jason Flemyng and the Man-Eating Leopard <b>of</b> Rudraprayag. <b>The</b> second <b>tells</b> <b>the</b> story <b>of</b> George Rushby and the Lions of Njombe, and <b>the</b> third <b>tells</b> <b>the</b> story <b>of</b> the Wolf of Gysinge.|$|R

500|$|The first vocal {{movement}} is a setting of verse 1 of Psalm 75, [...] "", translated in the King James {{version of the}} bible as [...] "Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare". In contrast to the virtuoso introduction, the chorus begins in motet style in grave stile antico. The bass begins in great simplicity a theme in even steps; the tenor starts imitating almost immediately, the alto a little later, then the soprano. A countersubject illustrates <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> God's wonders, embellishing the words [...] ("declare") and [...] ("wondrous works"). In the beginning only oboes and strings play [...] with the voices, then a trumpet doubles the soprano. Developing further, two trumpets {{take part in the}} polyphony, and a climax is reached when the third trumpet and timpani enter. Hofmann comments that although the movement begins in old style, [...] "Bach’s method of intensification (by means of which he gradually introduces trumpets and ultimately allows the theme to be heard in stretta) is thoroughly baroque.|$|E
500|$|Wagner {{may also}} have been {{influenced}} by the Rhine River-based German legend of Lorelei, the lovelorn young maiden who drowns herself in the river and becomes a siren, luring fishermen onto the rocks by her singing. Further possible sources lie in Greek mythology and literature. Similarities exist between the maiden guardians in the Hesperides myth and the Rhinemaidens of Das Rheingold; three females guard a highly desired golden treasure that is stolen in <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> each tale. Wagner was an enthusiastic reader of Aeschylus, including his Prometheus Bound which has a chorus of Oceanids or water nymphs. One author, Rudolph Sabor, sees a link between the Oceanids' treatment of Prometheus and the Rhinemaidens' initial tolerance of Alberich. Just as in Greek myth the Oceanids are the daughters of the titan sea god Oceanus, in Norse mythology—specifically the Poetic Edda—the jötunn (similar to a giant) sea god Ægir has nine daughters. The name of one of these means [...] "wave" [...] (Welle in German) and is a possible source for Wellgunde's name.|$|E
500|$|Game {{developer}} Ready at Dawn {{pitched the}} idea of a God of War game for the PlayStation Portable to SCE Santa Monica Studio soon after the original God of War launched. In February 2007, Ready at Dawn posted a teaser featuring [...] "Coming Soon" [...] in the God of War font. An editor from 1UP obtained an early copy of God of War II and posted the game's instruction manual, featuring a one-page teaser with [...] "PSP" [...] in the Omega symbol and stating [...] "Coming 2007". On March 12, 2007, God of War II was launched at the Metreon: God of War II Game Director Cory Barlog officially confirmed the development of Chains of Olympus, stating [...] "It is its own story that connects to the overall story. God of War, God of War II, and then if all the stars align God of War III will be <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> a trilogy. This PSP story will be a further fleshing out." [...] An initial trailer for Chains of Olympus was released on April 25, 2007, coinciding with the announcement of a demo on UMD—the optical disc medium for the PSP. The trailer is narrated by voice actress Linda Hunt.|$|E

500|$|The {{novel was}} first {{published}} on 7 August 2008, released in hardback by Sceptre in the UK. The hardback edition sold just 3,000 copies in 2008, however {{the publication of a}} paperback copy, released on 5 February 2009, saw increased sales, with 100,000 paperback copies sold in Britain in March and April 2009, despite no advertising and little marketing for the novel. As of November 2009, 300,000 copies of the novel had been sold. Richard Brooks of The Times attributed its success to recommendations from readers to family and friends, with Cleave calling it [...] "an example of word-of-mouth success." [...] The novel was published in America and Canada by Simon & Schuster under the alternative title Little Bee. It was released in hardback and e-book format in February 2009, and in paperback in February 2010. Cleave likes both titles, believing that The Other Hand [...] "speaks to the dichotomous nature of the novel, with its two narrators and two worlds", also referencing Sarah's injury, while Little Bee is appropriate as the novel is really <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> Little Bee's story, and sounds [...] "bright and approachable", in line with his aim to write [...] "an accessible story about a serious subject." ...|$|E
500|$|The typescript of {{the essay}} is headed by an epigraph, {{attributed}} to The Upbringing of Daughters by Catherine Durning Whethem. It reads: [...] "The chief justification of reading books of any sort is the enlargement of experience that should accrue therefrom". The text which follows is, in Motion's words, [...] "a homily on how and how not to write for children". It argues for the need for well-drawn heroines, and for unrepentant villainesses: [...] "To be tenacious in evil {{is the duty of}} every villain... Let her hate the heroine wholeheartedly, and refuse, yes, even on the last page, to take her hand in forgiveness". The story should not be about schoolgirls, but about a school with girls in it. The school must be English; foreign settings or trips abroad are disparaged. Larkin, in Coleman's voice, pleads for [...] "the Classic Unities": Unity of Place, which is the school and its inhabitants; Unity of Time, normally the term in which the action occurs; and Unity of Action, whereby every recorded incident contributes in some way to <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> the story. The essay is laden with quotations from many writers of the genre, among them Joy Francis, Dorita Fairlie Bruce, Elsie J. Oxenham, Elinor Brent-Dyer and Nancy Breary.|$|E
500|$|Folklorists Iona and Peter Opie {{observe that}} [...] "the tale {{is unusual in}} that the hero little deserves his good fortune, that is if his poverty, his being a third child, and his unquestioning {{acceptance}} of the cat's sinful instructions, are not nowadays looked upon as virtues." [...] The cat should be acclaimed the prince of 'con' artists, they declare, as few swindlers have been so successful before or since. The success of Histoires is attributed to seemingly contradictory and incompatible reasons. While the literary skill employed in <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> the tales has been recognized universally, it appears the tales were set down in great part as the author heard them told. The evidence for that assessment lies first in {{the simplicity of the}} tales, then in the use of words that were, in Perrault's era, considered populaire and du bas peuple, and finally, in the appearance of vestigial passages that now are superfluous to the plot, do not illuminate the narrative, and thus, are passages the Opies believe a literary artist would have rejected in the process of creating a work of art. One such vestigial passage is Puss's boots; his insistence upon the footwear is explained nowhere in the tale, it is not developed, nor is it referred to after its first mention except in an aside.|$|E
