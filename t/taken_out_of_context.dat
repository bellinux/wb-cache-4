5|$|In 2007, Murray {{suggested}} that tennis had a match-fixing problem, stating that {{everyone knows it}} goes on, {{in the wake of}} the investigation surrounding Nikolay Davydenko.

5000|$|According to argumentation theory scholar Michael A. Gilbert, before Kahane's 1971 book North American {{curricula}} {{on critical}} thinking and fallacies was primarily taught from textbooks (such as Irving Copi's Introduction to Logic) in which [...] "fallacies are presented in a brief fashion using examples that were mostly invented or <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context.</b> ... The 'radical change' was that Kahane's book took current examples from newspapers and periodicals dealing with issues students cared about or, at least, recognized. This meant that fallacies were more situated than in older books." ...|$|R
5000|$|In October 2007 {{television}} and radio host and commentator Bill O'Reilly said a Media Matters' headline declaring O'Reilly surprised [...] "there was no difference" [...] between Harlem restaurant and other New York restaurants <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context</b> comments he made regarding a pleasant dinner he shared with Al Sharpton at a Harlem restaurant. O'Reilly said Media Matters misleadingly took comments spoken five minutes apart and presented them as one. In an appearance on NBC's Today with Matt Lauer, Media Matters senior fellow Paul Waldman said Media Matters had included [...] "the full audio, the full transcript, nothing was <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> context".|$|R

25|$|Gil Student, an {{internet}} author, states that many {{attacks on the}} Talmud are merely recycling discredited material that originated in the 13th-century disputations, particularly from Raymond Marti and Nicholas Donin, and that the criticisms are based on quotations <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context,</b> and are sometimes entirely fabricated.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the show}} {{made it seem}} like Adam Carolla wanted center stage and to do [...] "potty humor" [...] Adam said that was never his {{intention}} and most {{of what he said}} was <b>taken</b> completely <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Rank-based grades become {{meaningless}} when <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> a given {{class or}} school.

5000|$|The New Yorker praised its release, {{calling it}} [...] "a {{striking}} artifact—an unmediated {{representation of the}} ambiguities and cruelties of modern warfare".

25|$|CBS 3 {{also made}} {{headlines}} in June 2013 when video surfaced on YouTube of weekend morning anchor Nicole Brewer and meteorologist Carol Erickson appearing to exchange on-air jibes {{at each other}} during their weekend morning newscasts.

25|$|In his lecture, the Pope, {{speaking}} in German, quoted a passage about Islam {{made at the}} end of the 14th century by Byzantine (Eastern Roman) emperor Manuel II Palaiologos. As the English translation of the Pope's lecture was disseminated across the world, the quotation was <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context</b> and many Islamic politicians and religious leaders protested against what they saw as an insulting mischaracterization of Islam.|$|E
25|$|Horowitz {{has been}} criticized for {{material}} in his books, particularly , by noted scholars such as Columbia University professor Todd Gitlin. The group Free Exchange on Campus issued a 50-page report in May 2006 in which they take issue with many of Horowitz's assertions in the book: they identify specific factual errors, unsubstantiated assertions, and quotations which appear to be either misquoted or <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese {{government}} conducted excavations of archeological {{sites and}} preserved artifacts found there. The Japanese administration also relocated some artifacts; for instance, a stone monument (...) , which was originally {{located in the}} Liaodong Peninsula, was <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its <b>context</b> and moved to Pyongyang.|$|R
5000|$|Professor Winfried Trusen of Würzburg, a {{correspondent}} of Radcliffe, wrote {{in part of}} a defence of Eckhart to Cardinal Ratzinger, stating Only 28 propositions were censured, but they were <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their <b>context</b> and impossible to verify, since there were no manuscripts in Avignon.|$|R

25|$|A thought {{experiment}} {{about public}} policy, on national radio, {{should not have}} received the condemnations it has. Anyone paying attention to this debate should be offended {{by those who have}} selectively quoted me, distorted my meaning, and <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context</b> the dialog I engaged in this week. Such distortions from 'leaders' of organizations and parties is a disgrace not only to the organizations and institutions they serve, but to the First Amendment.|$|E
25|$|Defenders of the Talmud {{argue that}} many of these criticisms, {{particularly}} those in antisemitic sources, are based on quotations that are <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context,</b> and thus misrepresent the meaning of the Talmud's text. Sometimes the misrepresentation is deliberate, and other times simply due to an inability to grasp the subtle and sometimes confusing narratives in the Talmud. Some quotations provided by critics deliberately omit passages in order to generate quotes that appear to be offensive or insulting.|$|E
25|$|Some of his assertions seem {{paradoxical}} {{and difficult}} to understand at first glance, {{not only because they}} are <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context,</b> but above all because our habits of thought make us reduce everything to its visible appearance in the world instead of trying to attain its invisible reality in life. It is this separation between visible appearance and invisible reality which allows the dissimulation of our real feelings and which grounds the possibility of sham and hypocrisy, which are forms of lies.|$|E
25|$|Butler {{responded to}} these criticisms {{by stating that}} her remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah were <b>taken</b> {{completely}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context</b> and badly, if not wittingly, distort her established views on non-violence. She has repeatedly condemned the violence and non-democratic actions of these groups while clearly advocating a politics committed to non-violence.|$|R
40|$|Recognise the quote? Hamlet is {{attempting}} to ensure the Player 2 ̆ 7 s performance before the King will be of sufficient quality to entrap the murderer into revealing his guilt.

5000|$|Chávez {{rejected}} the 2010 OAS report, calling it [...] "pure garbage", and said Venezuela should boycott the OAS; a spokesperson said, [...] "We don't recognize the commission as an impartial institution". He disclaims any power {{to influence the}} judiciary. [...] A Venezuelan official said the report distorts and <b>takes</b> statistics <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context,</b> saying that [...] "human rights violations in Venezuela have decreased".|$|R
25|$|Considering evidentiality {{as a type}} of epistemic {{modality}} {{may only}} be the result of analyzing non-European languages in terms of the systems of modality found in European languages. For example, the modal verbs in Germanic languages are used to indicate both evidentiality and epistemic modality (and are thus ambiguous when <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context).</b> Other (non-European) languages clearly mark these differently. De Haan (2001) finds that the use of modal verbs to indicate evidentiality is comparatively rare (based on a sample of 200 languages).|$|E
25|$|When Gore {{was running}} for the vice-presidential {{nomination}} in 1992, The New Republic {{picked up on the}} contrast between the references to Revelle in Gore's book, Earth in the Balance, and the views in the Cosmos article that could now be attributed to Revelle. This was followed up by Newsweek and elsewhere in the media. Patrick Michaels boasted that the Cosmos article had been read into the Congressional Record. The issue was even raised by Admiral James Stockdale in the televised vice-presidential debate. Gore's response was to protest that Revelle's views in the article had been <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context.</b>|$|E
25|$|Khan later {{clarified}} {{his comments}} in January 2016, {{saying that he}} never meant that India was intolerant or he thought about leaving the country. He said that his comments were <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context</b> and the media was responsible for it to some extent. Despite this, he continued to face backlash later in the year, with calls for protests and boycotts against his film Dangal. In October 2016, the Vishva Hindu Parishad called for protests against the film. Following its release in December 2016, #BoycottDangal was trending on Twitter, and BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya called for protests against the film.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} on Kevin and Bean, Pinsky has stated he will speak to any media outlet including TMZ and The National Enquirer, but will not speak to the Los Angeles Times, explaining [...] "They distort, and they mislead, and they <b>take</b> things <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context.</b> I really am stunned at how shoddy their journalism is, so I stopped talking to them." ...|$|R
50|$|Dashrath sends Viplav to Delhi, {{and tries}} to vacate the widow refuge. Luckily, Viplav arrives in Banaras to fight the court case {{on behalf of the}} widows. To {{distract}} Viplav, Dashrath and Viplav's mother arrange for him to get engaged to his childhood friend, Tanya. Viplav is enraged when he finds out that they were hiding the truth from him, and got him engaged by creating misunderstandings. He leaves the ceremony midway and goes to the temple, where he sees Dhaani drowning after fainting from weakness due to her fast. He saves her, but Dashrath's illegitimate son and right-hand man, Tripurari, takes pictures that Dhaani <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context</b> and creates more misunderstandings between the two. Later Viplav calls off engagement to Tanya. He blames himself for stealing the happiness of the widows and plans to stay in the widow refuge to help the widows rather than going to US.|$|R
40|$|If one {{sets out}} to compare {{national}} statistics on mortality, morbidity and health care generally in Canada and the USA in the decade from 1964 to 1974, {{the result is a}} set of tables and charts about {{three times the size of}} the set in this collection. What we have here is a subset selected for its representativeness, inherent interest and moderate cost. The total story will be told in the larger work from which the material here is drawn. The tree diagram on the very last page of this report will give you a rough idea of the scope of the larger work. If occasionally it looks as if tables have been <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>contexts</b> in which explanatory details and source materials should be included, that is because that is exactly what has happened. I have fairly rapidly put together a summary report of my current research...|$|R
25|$|In late October 2010, Sarah Palin {{announced}} on Fox News Channel that the Anchorage CBS-TV affiliate, KTVA, had been conspiring {{to make up}} stories about Miller and that the campaign had proof. It seemed that KTVA personnel had failed to hang up a phone after leaving a message for Miller's campaign spokesman and that their later comments were recorded on the spokesman's voicemail. During the conversation, they laughingly considered twittering about chaos at a Miller rally, and falsely reporting that sex offenders were there. The station's general manager initially took no action, saying the remarks were <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context,</b> but he later fired two producers involved, and canceled two newscasts to hold a staff meeting discussing ethics in journalism.|$|E
25|$|In November 2016, Dr Mohammad Anwar Sahib, the Imam of the Al-Taqwa {{mosque in}} Manukau, Auckland and a {{religious}} {{adviser to the}} FIANZ, drew controversy when he made offensive remarks about Jews, Christians, and women {{in a series of}} speeches that were posted by the right-wing blogger Cameron Slater on YouTube. Sahib's comments were condemned by a wide range of figures and groups in New Zealand society including the FIANZ's President Hazim Arafeh, the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand (IWCNZ), the Race Relations Commissioner Dame Susan Devoy, the Ethnic Communities Minister Sam Lotu-Iiga, the ACT party David Seymour, the New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, the New Zealand Jewish Council, and the Ahmadiyya community. In response to negative publicity, Sahib was dismissed from his advisory position at the FIANZ. Sahib denied accusations of racism and issued a statement claiming his statements had been <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context.</b>|$|E
25|$|At trial {{the village}} {{attorney}} had given testimony {{suggesting that he}} did not know the meaning of some of the terms in the guidelines, and the village president had testified that she did not know what, exactly, was being regulated. The Flipside had argued that these pointed to the statute's vagueness, but Leighton dismissed those concerns. Both passages had been <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context,</b> he wrote. The attorney had been describing how he relied on a report from the police on how such items were displayed in a store, and the village president had similarly explained how she had relied on expertise from the police that she did not herself possess to inform her vote in favor of the ordinance. The judge also noted that the village had enacted an administrative review process to resolve questions over potentially vague terms in the ordinance at the time of any application for a license.|$|E

Fourthly, that he puts undue emphasis on the work of moralists and educationalists while saying little of economic and political factors." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2016, {{answering}} to {{a question}} if he can still enter Crimea and his patriotic position, he stated that he can enter Crimea after each of his fight; that he doesn't like to talk politics {{due to the fact}} that people like to <b>take</b> words <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>context</b> and that in Russia he has many followers and he doesn't divide [...] "our peoples as we are Slavs".|$|R
2500|$|Margaret {{could also}} be charming and informal. People who {{came into contact with}} her could be perplexed by her swings between frivolity and formality. Former governess Marion Crawford wrote in her memoir, [...] "Impulsive and bright remarks she made became {{headlines}} and, <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their <b>context,</b> began to produce in the public eye an oddly distorted personality that bore little resemblance to the Margaret we knew." ...|$|R
