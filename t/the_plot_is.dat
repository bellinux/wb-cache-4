5|$|As {{the game}} proceeds, flashbacks occur showing events in Harris and Klebold's lives {{which may have}} caused them to commit murder; real life events are {{compressed}} into the game's timeframe for narrative purposes. Much of <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> constructed around the events precisely as they {{are believed to have}} occurred; lines of the gunmen's dialogue are often lifted verbatim from their writings or from their own home videos of each other. In contrast to the 16-bit graphics are digitized photographs from the shooting or full voice samples from news reports; photos of the school are used as backdrops during battle scenes.|$|E

5|$|Batman was a 15-chapter serial film {{released}} in 1943 by Columbia Pictures {{and was the}} first appearance of the comic book character on film. The serial starred Lewis Wilson as Batman and Douglas Croft as Robin. Being a World War II era production, the movie serial like many of this period was used as war-time propaganda and had an anti-Japanese bent with J. Carrol Naish playing the Japanese villain, an original character named Dr. Daka. Rounding out the cast were Shirley Patterson as Linda Page (Bruce Wayne's love interest), and William Austin as Alfred. <b>The</b> <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> based on Batman, a US government agent, attempting to defeat the Japanese agent Dr. Daka, at the height of World War II.|$|E

Before development, the Square Enix staff initially planned to make a PlayStation Portable port of the mobile phone game , but after discussion, they decided {{to create a new}} game. <b>The</b> <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> based on a scenario Kazushige Nojima had in mind when working on Final Fantasy VII.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> set in {{the fictional}} Indiana Jones {{universe}} and revolves around the eponymous protagonist's global search for the legendary sunken city of Atlantis. Sophia Hapgood, an old co-worker of Indiana Jones who gave up her archaeological career to become a psychic, supports him along the journey. The two partners are pursued by the Nazis who seek to {{use the power of}} Atlantis for warfare, and serve as the adventure's antagonists. The story was written by Hal Barwood and Noah Falstein, the game's designers, who had rejected the original plan to base it on an unused movie script. They came up with the final concept while researching real-world sources for a suitable plot device.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> {{traditional}} {{in regards}} to Restoration theatre and includes three female characters, three respectable males, three non-respectable males, and three side characters.

50|$|Reviewers were {{generally}} complimentary, citing good chemistry {{between the two}} leads, and the realistic depiction of modern Chinese society, especially the trials of Spring Festival, although one thought the inconsistencies in <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>were</b> slightly distracting.

5|$|The program {{expanded}} the usual {{conventions of the}} genre by using several types of metafiction, referencing the actors themselves or {{the nature of the}} program. An example within <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> Sos mi muqui, a program within the program whose characters were based on the show's main characters. The actors' former characters are occasionally referenced in plots that place them in similar contexts than those of older fictions. Martín infiltrated a convent using a habit similar to the one Arana's character in Padre Coraje wore, and Esperanza wore clothes similar to those Oreiro's character in Muñeca Brava wore when they had to get into a slum.|$|E
5|$|While {{incorporating}} gameplay {{elements from}} the original game and generally following the same plot, Sword of Mana has new gameplay mechanics and a much more involved story. It removes elements of the Final Fantasy series present in the original game as a marketing ploy, while adding in gameplay elements and artistic styles from later games in the series. <b>The</b> <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> modified to allow the player to follow the parallel stories of either the hero or the heroine, and the backstory and dialogue is expanded {{from the original}}. Sword of Mana was produced by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by Takeo Oin, and largely developed by employees of Brownie Brown who had previously worked on the series for Square.|$|E
5|$|A Dainty Politician is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on corruption political activity during a political convention in which a corrupt politician is running for re-election to the United States Congress. The votes are tallied and the challenger ties with the corrupt Congressman Casey, but a third candidate holds the balance of power. Casey bribes the third candidate to retire in his favor, but <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> uncovered and the two are ejected from the convention by a reporter {{who falls in love}} with challenger's daughter. The film was released on August 23, 1910, and saw a wide national release. Little is known of the actual production, but it received mixed reaction for the plausibility of its plot.

5|$|A {{major element}} of <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> {{based on the}} wuxia film series Palm of Ru Lai (如來神掌), {{released}} in 1964. Sing studied the fighting style used in Palm of Ru Lai ("Buddhist Palm style"), from a young age and used {{it at the end}} of Kung Fu Hustle. In reality, the Buddhist Palm fighting style does not leave palm-shaped craters and holes on impact. Instead, the user delivers powerful punches using his palm. The Beast's name in Chinese, Huoyun Xieshen (火雲邪神; Evil Deity of the Fiery Cloud), and the fight with the Landlady and her husband are also references to the Palm of Ru Lai, in which a mortally wounded master strikes the patterns of his art's final techniques into a bell so that his apprentice can learn from it. Kung Fu Hustle also contains direct references to characters from Louis Cha's wuxia novels. For example, the landlord and landlady refer to themselves as Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü, the names of characters in Cha's The Return of the Condor Heroes, when they met the Beast.|$|E
5|$|According to Daniel Joseph Singal, Faulkner's {{literary}} style gradually {{developed from}} 19th century Victorian to modernist, with Light in August more firmly {{grounded in the}} tradition of the latter. The novel is characteristic of the modernist fascination with polaritieslight and dark, good and evilthe burden of history on the present, and the splintering of personal identity. <b>The</b> <b>plot</b> <b>is</b> also divided into dual currents, one focusing on Lena Grove and the other on Joe Christmas, a technique that Faulkner continued to use in other works. The narrative is not structured in any particular order, as it is often interrupted by lengthy flashbacks and constantly shifts from one character to another. This lack of organization and narrative continuity was viewed negatively by some critics. As in his other novels, Faulkner employs elements of oral storytelling, allowing different characters to lend voice to the narrative in their own distinct Southern idiom. Unlike some of the other Yoknapatawpha County novels, notably The Sound and the Fury, Light in August does not rely solely on stream-of-consciousness narration, but also incorporates dialogue and an omniscient third-person narrator that develop the story.|$|E

While having characters and levels rendered in three-dimensions, the gameplay distances itself from the fully 3D graphics one seen in the last four games, bearing closer resemblance to that of the 2D era of the series, using a camera that is perpendicular to the two-dimensional playing field.|$|E
