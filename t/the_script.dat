5|$|<b>The</b> <b>script</b> {{for what}} was then known as Scary Movie went on sale on a Friday in June1995, but {{received}} no bids. By the following Monday, <b>the</b> <b>script</b> had become {{the subject of a}} significant bidding war among a host of established studios, including Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, and Morgan Creek Productions. Producer Cathy Konrad read <b>the</b> <b>script</b> and felt it was exactly what the Weinstein brothers of the fledgling Dimension Films — then a part of Miramax — were looking for. Dimension had previously released several horror films and intended to focus on that genre. Konrad brought <b>the</b> <b>script</b> to Bob Weinstein's assistant, Richard Potter. Believing it had potential, he brought it to Weinstein's attention. Studios began {{to drop out of the}} bidding as the price of <b>the</b> <b>script</b> increased, and the final two bidders were Oliver Stone, who was at the time working under Cinergi Pictures, and the Weinsteins of Dimension Films. Williamson agreed to a bid of $400,000 from Miramax, plus a contract for two sequels and a possible fourth unrelated film. Williamson said he chose Dimension because he believed they would produce Scary Movie immediately and without significantly censoring the violence in <b>the</b> <b>script.</b> Craven read <b>the</b> <b>script</b> before he became involved in the production, and considered convincing a studio to buy it for him to direct. However, by the time Craven read <b>the</b> <b>script,</b> it had already been sold.|$|E

50|$|In February 2013, <b>the</b> {{recording}} <b>script</b> was rewritten. <b>The</b> aspiration {{problem was}} fixed in <b>the</b> new <b>script</b> and <b>the</b> sounds were compacted {{to make it}} easier to control the phonetic data better. In March, two more singers were recorded using <b>the</b> new <b>script.</b> <b>The</b> new <b>script</b> was shorter than the past one and was more difficult for any singer to produce. However, <b>the</b> <b>scripts</b> new results sacrificed expression for clarity and mislabeling was gone. Further tweaks to <b>the</b> <b>scripts</b> were done as recordings went ahead.|$|R

5|$|According to Gary Oldman, {{very little}} was written about Oswald in <b>the</b> <b>script.</b> Stone gave him several plane tickets, {{a list of}} contacts, {{and told him to}} do his own research. Oldman met with Oswald's wife, Marina, and her two daughters to prepare for the role. Beata Poźniak studied 26 volumes of the Warren Report and spent time living with Marina Oswald. Since <b>the</b> <b>script</b> {{contained}} few lines for the Oswalds, Poźniak interviewed acquaintances of the Oswalds in order to improvise her scenes with Gary Oldman.|$|E
5|$|At an {{appearance}} at the Armadillo World Headquarters, a music venue in Austin, Texas, Nelson met publisher and screenwriter William D. Wittliff. Because {{of the success of}} the album, Wittliff decided to write a script for Nelson based on the story of the Red Headed Stranger. In 1979 Wittliff finished a draft of the project, which was turned over to Universal Studios. The studio budgeted the film at $14 million and sent <b>the</b> <b>script</b> to Robert Redford, who turned it down. The movie project was tabled, and Wittliff and Nelson had to buy <b>the</b> <b>script</b> back from Universal. <b>The</b> <b>script</b> then went to HBO, who assigned the project a budget of $5 million, but this project was not completed either. Finally, Nelson and Wittliff decided to finance the film themselves. Nelson portrayed the role of the stranger, and the movie was released in 1986.|$|E

5|$|B. Nagi Reddy of Vijaya Vauhini Studios helped B. Vittalacharya in the {{production}} of Mane Thumbida Hennu (1958), the latter's directorial debut in Kannada cinema. As an act of gratitude, Vittalacharya sold the remake rights to Nagi Reddy. Mane Thumbida Hennu revolves around the life of a rich woman whose brother marries off her daughter to a criminal when she chooses a mentally challenged person as her step-daughter's life partner. Nagi Reddy chose to remake the film in Telugu and discussed it with D. V. Narasa Raju; {{it was the first time}} Vijaya Vauhini Studios decided to remake a film. After <b>the</b> <b>script</b> was ready, Nagi Reddy approached C. Pullaiah to direct the remake after considering Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy.

5|$|Brooker {{originally}} {{wrote the}} episode in an apocalyptic setting, but when <b>the</b> <b>script</b> {{was about to}} be filmed at a former U.S. Air Force base, he changed it because of a fence he saw there.

The main change was the addition of a plot twist at the end of <b>the</b> <b>script,</b> which was noted as the most impressive aspect of the episode by several reviewers.|$|E

Producer Lou Scheimer contacted Weinstein and informed him that they wanted to purchase <b>the</b> <b>script</b> if the ending could be modified, which Weinstein agreed to. Weinstein was 19 at the time and staying in the dormitory at the University of Connecticut, and Scheimer was surprised to find out that Weinstein was so young.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1988 {{publication}} of Roddy Doyle's novel The Commitments (1987) in the United Kingdom, producers Lynda Myles and Roger Randall-Cutler acquired the film rights, and asked Doyle {{to write a}} film adaptation.

5|$|In 1961, {{while working}} on his first feature film Ivan's Childhood, Tarkovsky made a {{proposal}} to Mosfilm for a film {{on the life of}} Russia's greatest icon painter, Andrei Rublev. The contract was signed in 1962 and the first treatment was approved in December 1963.

In June 2008, Craig Gillespie and Ryan Gosling were in talks to join the film, which was to be produced by David Bushell and Marc Abraham for Universal Pictures and Strike Entertainment. Chase Palmer was writing <b>the</b> <b>script</b> that time around, and screenwriters Guillermo Arriaga and Stephen Belber had reportedly also written the subsequent drafts for the film. In 2009, producer Robbie Brenner got involved again and rejected all the rewrites of <b>the</b> <b>script,</b> and the original version by Borten and Wallack was sent to actor Matthew McConaughey to see if the Dallas native would be interested in playing the role.
