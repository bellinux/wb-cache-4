500|$|Riot Act {{received}} mixed to favorable {{reviews from}} music critics according to Metacritic, where it holds a 73 after 20 reviews. NME gave Riot Act an {{eight out of}} ten. Reviewer Louis Pattison stated that [...] "Riot Act {{is the sound of}} a band entering a powerful middle-age. They still deserve your attention." [...] AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four out of five stars, saying [...] "given several plays, this does indeed seem like the richest record Pearl Jam has made in a long time." [...] Spin gave the album seven out of ten stars. The review said, [...] "Pearl Jam's seventh studio album balances emotive bombast with a taut-sweaty hard-rock attack." [...] Critic Robert Christgau described Pearl Jam on the album as [...] "masters of their own audio, with soft spots where their emotions can go." [...] Rolling Stone staff writer Keith Harris gave the album three out of five stars, saying that [...] "like Neil Young at his most deliberately despondent, Pearl Jam sound purposefully tired." [...] Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B, saying that Vedder's lyrics [...] "rarely cohere", and that [...] "too few of the tense rhythmic setups build to the kind of...catharsis <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> to Riot home about." [...] Q gave the album three out of five stars. The review called the album [...] "An adult rock record in which nuance succeeds over bombast." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 21, 2010, The President's Council {{announced}} a change to Goshen's long-standing policy, and thus allowing an instrumental {{version of the}} national anthem to be played prior to some college sporting events. This decision led to numerous complaints from students, faculty and alumni. [...] College art professor, John Blosser, was quoted saying, “It’s obviously about a battle. [...] It’s rather violent. It’s about using violence to conquer and <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> that many people here would have problems with.” In response, Goshen's Board of Directors reversed the President's Council decision on June 6, 2011, after seeking extensive input from the college community.|$|E

The pilot opens with a 4-5 minute sequence which I think is really harrowing and really dangerous, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> that you might have seen on Chicago Code or The Shield. I want it to feel grounded in that way. There'll be some opportunities for laughs after that. It's not a laughs come first show." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{next thing}} was to hire a coachman to take us, in the rain,--for the mist had now swelled into a rain,--through the whole {{appropriate}} round.

6000|$|Baroni made {{a sign to}} them {{to leave}} the tent.

This is death or madness, perhaps both. What will M. de Sidonia say? He loves not men who fail. All will be visited on me. I shall be shelved. In Europe they would bleed him, and they would kill him; here they will not bleed him, and he may die. Such is medicine, and such is life!

60|$|It {{was easier}} to say that at first than to say {{anything}} else. They sat looking at each other.

Each felt <b>that</b> there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> scorching in the words <b>that</b> <b>would</b> recall the irretrievable wrong. But soon, as Maggie looked, every distinct thought began to be overflowed by a wave of loving penitence, and words burst forth with a sob.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{invention}} of 16-track and 2-inch tape there was the belief {{for quite a while}} <b>that</b> there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> wrong with editing tape that big.

5000|$|Bill Harmsen {{founded the}} Jolly Rancher Company in 1949 {{with the goal}} of having a name that seemed {{friendly}} and welcoming to customers.

[...] Still she said nothing; she only stood looking at him, now quite without pretending to ease. [...] "I'm told you're unhappy, and if you are I should like to know it. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> for me.

6000|$|... “Doesn’t it ever strike you,” {{continued}} the niece relentlessly, “that if we {{moved away from}} here or were blotted out of existence our local claim to fame would pass on automatically to whoever happened to take the house and garden? People would say to one another, ‘Have you seen the Smith-Jenkins’ magnolia? It is a perfect mass of flowers,’ or else ‘Smith-Jenkins tells me there won’t be a single blossom on their magnolia this year; the east winds have turned all the buds black.’ Now if, when we had gone, people still associated our names with the magnolia tree, no matter who temporarily possessed it, if they said, ‘Ah, that’s the tree on which the Gurtleberrys hung their cook because she sent up {{the wrong kind of}} sauce with the asparagus,’ <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> really due to our own initiative, apart from anything east winds or magnolia vitality might have to say in the matter.” ...|$|E
60|$|Much of {{this had}} Akut taught him, {{but far more}} was instinctive knowledge--a species of strange intuition {{inherited}} from his father. He had come to love the jungle life. The constant battle of wits and senses against the many deadly foes that lurked by day and by night along the pathway of the wary and the unwary appealed {{to the spirit of}} adventure which breathes strong in the heart of every red-blooded son of primordial Adam. Yet, though he loved it, he had not let his selfish desires outweigh the sense of duty that had brought him to a realization of the moral wrong which lay beneath the adventurous escapade that had brought him to Africa. His love of father and mother was strong within him, too strong to permit unalloyed happiness which was undoubtedly causing them days of sorrow. And so he held tight to his determination to find a port upon the coast where he might communicate with them and receive funds for his return to London. There he felt sure that he could now persuade his parents to let him spend at least a portion of his time upon those African estates which from little careless remarks dropped at home he knew his father possessed. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something,</b> better at least than a lifetime of the cramped and cloying restrictions of civilization.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} her watch. It was six o'clock.

"He told me," [...] {{she went}} on, {{as he was}} about to speak, [...] "that you had made up your mind to tell mamma about it, {{directly}} you heard that I was engaged to Mr. Carthew. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>something,</b> but <b>would</b> hardly have <b>been</b> fair to me.

It seemed bitterly unfair that Charlie's memory should fail me when I needed it most. Great Powers above--I {{looked up at}} them through the fog smoke--did the Lords of Life and Death know what this meant to me? Nothing less than eternal fame of the best kind, that comes from One, and is shared by one alone. I would be content--remembering Clive, I stood astounded at my own moderation,--with the mere right to tell one story, to work out one little contribution to the light literature of the day. If Charlie were permitted full recollection for one hour--for sixty short minutes--of existences that had extended over a thousand years--I would forego all profit and honor from all that I should make of his speech. I would take no share in the commotion that would follow throughout the particular corner of the earth that calls itself [...] "the world." [...] The thing should be put forth anonymously. Nay, I would make other men believe that they had written it. They would hire bull-hided self-advertising Englishmen to bellow it abroad. Preachers would found a fresh conduct of life upon it, swearing that it was new {{and that they had}} lifted the fear of death from all mankind. Every Orientalist in Europe would patronize it discursively with Sanskrit and Pali texts. Terrible women would invent unclean variants of the men's belief for the elevation of their sisters. Churches and religions would war over it. Between the hailing and re-starting of an omnibus I foresaw the scuffles that would arise among half a dozen denominations all professing [...] "the doctrine of the True Metempsychosis as applied to the world and the New Era"; and saw, too, the respectable English newspapers shying, like frightened kine, over the beautiful simplicity of the tale. The mind leaped forward a hundred--two hundred--a thousand years. I saw with sorrow that men would mutilate and garble the story; that rival creeds would turn it upside down till, at last, the western world which clings to the dread of death more closely than the hope of life, would set it aside as an interesting superstition and stampede after some faith so long forgotten that it seemed altogether new. Upon this I changed the terms of the bargain that I would make with the Lords of Life and Death. Only let me know, let me write, the story with sure knowledge that I wrote the truth, and I would burn the manuscript as a solemn sacrifice. Five minutes after the last line was written I would destroy it all. But I must be allowed to write it with absolute certainty.|$|E
