5|$|Although Casablanca was an A-list {{film with}} {{established}} stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production expected it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> {{out of the}} ordinary. It {{was just one of}} hundreds of pictures produced by Hollywood every year. Casablanca was rushed into release {{to take advantage of the}} publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.|$|E
5|$|The {{liquid water}} density within a cumulus cloud {{has been found}} to change with height above the cloud base rather than being {{approximately}} constant throughout the cloud. At the cloud base, the concentration was 0grams of liquid water per kilogram of air. As altitude increased, the concentration rapidly increased to the maximum concentration near the middle of the cloud. The maximum concentration was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> up to 1.25grams of water per kilogram of air. The concentration slowly dropped off as altitude increased to the height of the top of the cloud, where it immediately dropped to zero again.|$|E
5|$|The Athenians now {{ended their}} {{alliance}} with the Ionians, since the Persians had proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> but the easy prey that Aristagoras had described. However, the Ionians remained committed to their rebellion and the Persians {{did not seem to}} follow up their victory at Ephesus. Presumably these ad hoc forces were not equipped to lay siege to any of the cities. Despite the defeat at Ephesus, the revolt actually spread further. The Ionians sent men to the Hellespont and Propontis and captured Byzantium and the other nearby cities. They also persuaded the Carians to join the rebellion. Furthermore, seeing the spread of the rebellion, the kingdoms of Cyprus also revolted against Persian rule without any outside persuasion.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the rugged}} terrain and rough waters {{on the two}} rivers, {{especially}} on the glacier-fed Kootenay, steamboat operation was extremely difficult and proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> but cost effective. The roughest water was in Jennings Canyon, now mostly submerged in the Lake Koocanusa reservoir behind Libby Dam. Two of the first steamers, the Duchess and the Cline, both sank when transporting miners to the Wild Horse gold rush on the Kootenay. Both ships had not even reached Canal Flats when they hit rocks in the Columbia. The first steamboat to actually run the Kootenay was the Annerly in 1893. Later vessels, such as the Gwendoline, had mixed success. Captain Frank P. Armstrong, who had piloted several earlier steamboats on the Golden-Jennings run, was her builder {{and when she was}} about three-quarters completed, Armstrong decided to take her to Golden to complete the job. Gwendoline sailed up to the canal, which unfortunately was unusable because the gates of the lock had been dynamited due to a Kootenay flood. Armstrong was forced to portage the vessel and eventually made it to Golden. Gwendoline eventually sailed back south to Jennings to haul iron ore on the Kootenay. She was also the only ship to ever travel through the canal by proper means, and made two of the only three steamboat trips through the canal.|$|E
5|$|The {{first public}} {{announcement}} of the cancellation of the Paramount Television Service and Phase II came {{at the hands of}} the gossip columnist Rona Barrett at the start of December. In response, Paramount released a statement that said the new network had been pushed back to the fall of 1978, and that Phase II had its episode order increased from 13 to between 15 and 22. Despite this, behind the scenes, production continued on Star Trek as a film, not as a series. One of the changes around the same time as Barrett's reports was the realization that all the model work completed thus far had to be restarted from scratch, as it was not detailed enough to be blown up on a motion picture-sized screen. Two further changes took place in December: Collins was dropped as director, for Paramount wanted a motion picture director and not one with experience only in television; and Livingston allowed his contract to run out and left the production, owing to the poor relationship he had with Roddenberry. By January, Paramount no longer pretended that Star Trek was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> other than a feature film. Livingston was brought back, but only in a writing capacity, and Robert Wise was hired as director on the film to replace Collins.|$|E

25|$|The Radicals, {{having been}} strenuous {{in their efforts}} on behalf of the working classes, earned a deeply loyal following; British trade unionists from 1874 until 1892, upon being elected to Parliament, never {{considered}} themselves <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> other than Radicals, and were labeled Lib-Lab candidates.

25|$|Mentalism {{creates the}} {{illusion}} that the magician can read minds. Comedy magic {{is the use of}} magic combined with stand-up comedy, an example being Penn & Teller. Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> other than a clever and skillful deception. Others argue that they can claim that the effects are due to magic. These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. Another issue is the use of deceptive practices for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance. Examples include fraudulent mediums, con men and grifters who use deception for cheating at card games.|$|E
25|$|When the Lincoln Cent was {{introduced}} in 1909, {{it was discovered that}} the coining dies and their curved fields were unable to be polished to proof coining condition by existing Mint equipment. To produce Proof coinage for collectors, the U.S. Mint adopted the French technique of the Matte Proof, which was thought to highlight the design, while leaving the details of the coin as the designer intended. This was done by a sandblasting of the dies prior to use. When struck by the high pressure hydraulic press of the Philadelphia Mint Medal Room, the result was a semi-rough surface, a gentle luster and strongly defined wide square rims. These coins were produced in very small numbers, and the dies quickly developed small marks, known as diagnostics. These marks are used today by Third Party Graders and Collectors to authenticate the coin. Sold for mere pennies over face during the years of production, they were not popular with collectors. When new, the coins were wrapped in a tarnish-proof tissue, which over time proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> but. Since many of these coins sat for decades unsold, vivid colors and toning developed. It is not unusual to see vivid blues, greens, lavender, coppery orange, deep reds and purple hues on these coins. Eagerly collected by numismatists today, they are among the most valuable Lincoln cents. Unencapsulated coins are easily identified by wide, square outer rims, quite unlike the rounded edges of business strikes.|$|E

Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five, noting that the episode was [...] "just too unambitious an X-File <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> more than a collection of moments, only some of which work".|$|E

500|$|Anna Silman of Salon named [...] "Dear Future Husband" [...] {{the worst}} song of 2015, criticizing its [...] "aggressively heteronormative message" [...] and Trainor's vocal performance. Mic's Kate Beaudoin heavily criticized the song's lyrics, writing, [...] "This song teaches kids {{that men are}} born to be husbands and women are born to be wives. But that kind of {{rationale}} wears away at a woman's right <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> she wants." [...] Nolan Feeney of TIME was critical of the song, writing, [...] "What she’s describing is not a relationship—it’s a Meghtatorship." [...] The Los Angeles Times Mikael Wood had a mixed opinion on the song, stating that Trainor seems to be sketching [...] "a union of equals". But, added that she later expressed more conventional ideas about the female character in a marriage.|$|E
500|$|Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly {{described}} the song as {{a throwback to}} Madonna's mid-1990s style. Nick Levine from The National felt that the song would fit neatly onto her 1995 ballads compilation Something to Remember. Blogcritics editor Tyrone S. Reid called the song a [...] "slow-burning instant classic," [...] which recalls Madonna's Ray of Light era. A writer for Idolator website said that the song's minimal production [...] "remind us very much of Madge's American Life days, allowing us {{to focus on the}} lovely lyrics and Madonna's gorgeous vocals. All in all, a terrific effort that bodes well for [...]" [...] Robert Copsey from Digital Spy felt that the song's production is more [...] "organic" [...] and [...] "it doesn't try <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> other than a solid pop song." ...|$|E
500|$|Additional {{writing and}} song {{production}} were done by Canadian band Let's Go to War, {{whose members are}} Henry Walter, Adrien Gough and Peter-John Kerr.

After selecting it, Spears' management required several changes to the song, making [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] "substantially different from what was submitted." [...] Walter revealed they had no contact with the singer for the song production, and considered [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] as [...] "something different for Britney" [...] and [...] "a fun track and is not trying <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> it's not." [...] Spears recorded her vocals for the song in 2008 at Train Tracks Studios and Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, with Walter and Eric Eylands. Guitar was provided by Chris Worthy, and audio mixing was done by Tony Maserati.|$|E
