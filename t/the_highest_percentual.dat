In several western countries {{is the number of}} death higher then number of cancer death. In this time is used a lot of methods for prediction of {{sudden cardiac death}} with focus on ECG T-wave alternance. The aim of the theses was to do stronger relation and cooperation with Internal Cardiac Clinic of Faculty Hospital Brno Bohunice on the risk analysis of sudden cardiac death. Secondly, we met the methods used for detection and quantification of simulated TWA. Last but not least was necessary to find TWA detection methods improvement and process the data on real signals obtained from Faculty Hospital Brno Bohunice. First part of the Thesis is focused on summary of pathologic artifacts in ECG signal, which are important for sudden cardiac risk stratification. There are described further known detection and quantification methods for TWA analysis. An interesting part for clinical practice is analysis of TWA trend in time and looking for the best method, which is able to catch and track the short TWA trend changes. Second part describes the new methods improvements, which were tested with interesting outputs. Further, there was developed method for TWA presence statement probability evaluation...|$|R

Esta pesquisa objetivou a recuperação de códigos do PASP de indivíduos de Calidris alba (Pallas 1764) entre os anos de 1993 a 1995 na Coroa do Avião. Essas recuperações visuais demonstraram a fidelidade de Calidris alba ao seu sítio de invernada, a Coroa do Avião. O alto percentual de recuperações de Calidris alba, bem como, as recuperações de indivíduos anilhados na Lagoa do Peixe e em algumas áreas de invernada nos Estados Unidos, demonstram a utilização da rota do Atlântico e reforça a idéia de que bandos provenientes da costa leste do Alaska migram por esta rota. A idade máxima estimada para Calidris alba durante esta pesquisa foi de 11 anos, nada se tem sobre a idade desta espécie em bibliografias específicas no estudo de Scolopacidae. Marking {{programs}} for migratory {{species have been}} developed since the 1980 decade, among them the PASP Pan-American Shorebirds Programs which consisted in the marking of nearctic migratory birds with color bands and flags, enabling the development of individual codes, allowing the observation of the marked birds without the need of capture.

40|$|Objective: To {{verify the}} {{alterations}} promoted by creatine supplementation in the anthropometric {{variables and the}} resultant of dynamic maximum strength (RDMS) in college students submitted to 8 wk of strength training. Methodology: The sample consisted of 18 male college students, aged between 19 to 25 years. Height (cm), body mass (kg) and tests of maximum voluntary muscular action (1 MVMA) weight in the squat were determined prior to the training. The subjects were divided in two groups: A (creatine) or B (placebo). The double-blind protocol was adopted. After 8 weeks of strength training, the tests battery from the pre-training was repeated. Results: After 8 wk of training, it was verified that both groups had statistically significant (SS) alterations in the RDMS in all the exercises (p = 0. 007 / 0. 008). The analysis of the percentile improvement (PI) and the RDMS delta in the squat exercises, military press and close-grip-extensions, showed that group A had positive SS alterations higher than group B (p = 0. 008 / 0. 038). Lean body mass only SS increased in group A (p = 0. 038). However, the percentage of body fat did not show alterations in none of the groups.

METODOLOGIA: Participaram deste estudo, 18 universitários do sexo masculino, com idade entre 19 e 25 anos. Antes do treinamento foram determinadas a estatura (cm), a massa {{corporal}} (kg) e testes de ação muscular voluntária máxima dinâmica (1 AMVMD), os sujeitos foram assinalados a um dos dois grupos, A (creatina) e B (placebo), foi adotado o protocolo duplo-cego. Após oito semanas de treinamento de força, repetiu-se a bateria de testes do pré-treinamento. RESULTADOS: Após oito semanas, verificou-se que tanto no grupo A como no B houve alterações estatisticamente significantes (ES) na RFMD em todos os exercícios (p = 0, 007 a 0, 008). A análise da melhora percentual e do delta da RFMD, nos exercícios de agachamento, desenvolvimento e supino fechado, mostrou que o grupo A teve alterações positivas ES superiores ao grupo B (p = 0, 008 a 0, 038). A massa magra aumentou ES somente no grupo A (p = 0, 038). Contudo, o percentual de gordura corporal não mostrou alterações em nenhum dos grupos. A relação entre a melhora percentual (MP) das circunferências (C) do braço e antebraço e a MP na RFMD do exercício de desenvolvimento foi ES (r = 0, 481 e 0, 546, respectivamente), bem como entre a MP na C da coxa e na MP da RFMD do exercício de agachamento (r = 0, 619). CONCLUSÃO: Independente do suplemento ingerido o treinamento de força foi capaz de induzir ajustes positivos na RFMD; contudo, a suplementação de creatina mostrou-se mais eficiente que o placebo, induzindo a maior aumento percentual e de delta na força.

The kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) of parental strain, 5 clones and 14 subclones were analyzed. Schizodeme was established by comparative study of the fragments obtained from digestion of the 330 -bp fragments amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the variable regions of the minicicles, and digested by restriction endonucleases Rsa I and Hinf I. Our results show a <b>high</b> <b>percentual</b> of similarity between the restriction fragment lenght polymorphism (RFLP) for the parental strain and its clones and among these individual clones and their subclones {{at a level of}} 80 to 100 %. This homology indicates a predominance of the same ???principal clone??? in the 21 SF strain and confirms the homogeneity previously observed at biological and isozymic analysis. These results suggest the possibility that the T. cruzi strains with similar biological and isoenzymic patterns, circulating in this endemic area, are representative of one dominant clone. The presence of ???principal clones??? could be responsible for a predominant tropism of the parasites for specific organs and tissues and this could contribute to the pattern of clinico-pathological manifestations of Chagas???s disease in one geographical area...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThirty mixed-parity Landrace×Large White sows {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} the effects of the type of farrowing room on 28 -day lactation behaviour under tropical conditions during summer. The sows were allocated in a completely randomised design with three treatments with 10 replicates according to parity number and body weight, with each animal being considered an experimental unit. The treatments consisted of a conventional farrowing room (T 1); a conventional farrowing room with floor cooling under the sow (T 2); and a semi-outdoor farrowing room without a cage and with access to a fenced field (T 3). The sows from T 1 and T 2 groups were exposed to mean maximum and minimum environmental temperatures of 25. 7 and 21. 0 °C, respectively, and the sows from the T 3 group to average maximum and minimum environmental temperatures of 26. 5 and 20. 7 °C, respectively. The feed consumption of T 3 sows was numerically <b>higher</b> than <b>the</b> T 1 and T 2 sows (+ 9. 5 % on average). The body-weight loss was influenced at 28 days (P< 0. 10) by treatment, being that the T 3 sows gained weight (+ 4. 7 kg) while the T 1 and T 2 sows lost weight (− 11. 9 and − 3. 7 kg, respectively for T 1 and T 2). The T 3 sows showed a <b>higher</b> <b>percentual</b> litter mortality than the T 1 and T 2 sows (3. 2 % vs. 0 % vs. 7. 8 %, respectively for T 1, T 2 and T 3 sows). From farrowing until day 28 of lactation, the T 2 and T 3 sows showed higher lactation efficiency when compared with the T 1 sows (72 % vs. 87 % vs. 88 %, respectively for T 1, T 2 and T 3 sows). The T 1 sows showed higher (P< 0. 01) frequencies of visits to the feeder and drinker (+ 38 % on average). The T 3 sows spent more time (P< 0. 01) at the drinker than T 1 and T 2 sows (23 vs. 23 vs. 32 min, respectively for T 1, T 2 and T 3 sows). The T 3 sows showed a higher (P< 0. 10) frequency of nursing than the other treatments (+ 15 % on average). T 1 and T 2 sows were found to spend more time (P< 0. 01) performing other postures during 24 h than sows maintained in T 3 (50 vs. 51 vs. 22 min/d, respectively for T 1, T 2 and T 3). It is concluded that cooling of the floor under the sow in the conventional farrowing room or the use of semi-outdoor farrowing rooms improves the thermal environment and the lactation efficiency of the sows housed in hot ambient temperatures at 28 -day lactation in the summer period, indicating an improved welfare...|$|R
