5|$|The {{preceding}} {{section of}} the poem had dealt at some length with the extended family of Porthaon's sister Demodice, tracing her line down to the generation following the Trojan War. Here ē' hoiai (plural) is used to jump backwards in order to complete the account of <b>the</b> <b>descendants</b> <b>of</b> Porthaon and Demodice's father Agenor by covering the son's family. Elsewhere the formula is used in transitions to more distant branches. The Ehoie of Mestra, for example, ultimately serves to reintroduce the family of Sisyphus, Mestra's great-granduncle who hoped to win her as bride for his son Glaucus. Although that marriage does not take place, <b>the</b> <b>descendants</b> <b>of</b> Sisyphus are soon presented.|$|E
5|$|Áedán was {{succeeded by}} his son, Eochaid Buide. Adomnán gives {{an account of}} Columba's prophecy that Eochaid's older {{brothers}} would predecease their father.

Adomnán also names Artúr, called a son of Conaing in the Senchus, and Domangart, who {{is not included in}} the Senchus. Domangart too may have been a grandson rather than a son of Áedán, most likely another son of Conaing. The main line of Cenél nGabráin kings were <b>the</b> <b>descendants</b> <b>of</b> Eochaid Buide through his son Domnall Brecc, but <b>the</b> <b>descendants</b> <b>of</b> Conaing successfully contested for the throne throughout the 7th century and into the 8th.|$|E

5|$|In 1054, Yaropolk {{became the}} son of the Grand Prince, as in that year Izyaslav ascended the throne of Kiev. Izyaslav's rule and thus Yaropolk's {{security}} were however quickly challenged by Izyaslav's brother Svyatoslav and by his cousin Vseslav Briacheslavich. At this time among the Rurikids, there were two senior branches that could claim the Grand Princeship through descent from Vladimir the Great; namely, the descendents of Yaroslav Vladimirovich and <b>the</b> <b>descendants</b> <b>of</b> Izyaslav Vladimirovich.|$|E
5|$|In 1067, Vseslav rebelled in {{an attempt}} to {{overthrow}} Izyaslav and become Grand Prince himself, claiming the right as a great-grandson of Vladimir the Great through Izyaslav Vladimirovich. Vseslav's attempt was unsuccessful, and ended in his imprisonment. Troubles for Izyaslav were to continue though. In 1068, Izyaslav's alleged negligence to the advances and incursions of the Cuman people (Polovtsy) after the defeat at the Battle of the Alta River led the citizens of Kiev to revolt; Vseslav was released, and took the Kievan throne while Izyaslav fled to Boleslaw in Poland. With Polish assistance Izyaslav returned in May 1069, expelled Vseslav and retook the throne. This victory for Izyaslav secured the Kievan throne for <b>the</b> <b>descendants</b> <b>of</b> Yaroslav Vladimirovich, and thereafter <b>the</b> <b>descendants</b> <b>of</b> Izyaslav Vladimirovich confined themselves to Polotsk where they reigned with semi-independent status.|$|E
5|$|Invasion by Magnus Barefoot in {{the late}} 11th century {{resulted}} in {{a brief period of}} direct Norwegian rule over the kingdom, but soon <b>the</b> <b>descendants</b> <b>of</b> Godred Crovan re-asserted a further period of largely independent overlordship. This came to an end with the emergence of Somerled, on whose death in 1164 the kingdom was split in two.

5|$|The Australian {{zoologist}} John Veron and {{his co-workers}} analyzed ribosomal RNA in 1996 to obtain similar results to Romano and Palumbi, again concluding that the traditional families were plausible but that the suborders were incorrect.

Veron suggested that both morphological and molecular systems be used in future classification schemes.|$|E
