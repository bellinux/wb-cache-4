2500|$|Spinoza was a thoroughgoing determinist {{who held}} that {{absolutely}} {{everything that happens}} occurs through the operation of necessity. For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, with freedom being our capacity <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> are determined and to understand why we act as we do. By forming more [...] "adequate" [...] ideas {{about what we do}} and our emotions or affections, we become the adequate cause of our effects (internal or external), which entails an increase in activity (versus passivity). This means that we become both more free and more like God, as Spinoza argues in the Scholium to Prop. 49, Part II. However, Spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen the way that it does.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of his career, Chamberlain became more pessimistic in his conclusions, believing that notions about union-management {{collaboration}} would have scant impact on the corporation's ability to react to external events. [...] He also grew dissatisfied with the development of economic analysis, believing it too formal and beholden to quantitative methods and lacking a value-based look at how corporate management behaved. [...] Indeed, Chamberlain became skeptical about his discipline as a whole. [...] In the context of a 1980 New York Times piece about the hazards of poorly conducted social science research, he was quoted as saying, [...] "We know very little about what we profess <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>We</b> have claimed too much as a profession." [...] He came to have philosophical doubts about the entire study of economics, believing that purposeful action, unforeseen trends, and random occurrences combine to give economic theories that are based upon the observation of what has taken place in the past little predictive ability or policy-making usefulness in terms of what will take place in the future.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Williamson {{argues that}} when one feels cold, one {{may not be in}} a {{position}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that one feels cold. He thinks this argument can be generalized to show that no mental states are such that when we are in them we are in a position <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that <b>we</b> are in them. I argue that his argument is a sorites argument in disguise because it relies on the implicit premise that warming up is gradual. Williamson claims that his argument is not a sorites argument; I explain why he has not given us any reason to accept the claim. It is obvious to most of us that when we feel cold, we are in a position <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that <b>we</b> feel cold, and when we do not feel cold, we are in a position <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that <b>we</b> do not feel cold. To deny it seems absurd. This {{does not mean that we}} are always in a position <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whether <b>we</b> feel cold or not, for it is not true that we either feel cold or do not feel cold ⎯ sometimes we feel something in between. The expression ‘feels cold’, like the expression ‘bald’, is vague and admits of borderline cases. Timothy Williamson in his Knowledge and Its Limits has, however, offered an argument trying to show that even when we clearly feel cold, we may not be in a position <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that <b>we</b> do (Williamson, 2000, Chapter 4). 1 In his terminology, feeling cold is not a luminou...|$|R

The resonance model suggested by Klu´zniak & Abramowicz (2000, 2001) explains twin QPOs as two weakly coupled nonlinear resonant epicyclic modes in the accretion disk. Although this model successfully explains many features of the observed QPOs, it still faces difficulties and shortcomings. Here we summarize the aspects of the theory that remain a puzzle and we briefly discuss likely developments.
