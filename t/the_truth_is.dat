5|$|I never agreed, {{even as a}} young person, {{with the}} Thomas Wolfe title You Can't Go Home Again. Instinctively I didn’t. But <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is,</b> you can never leave home. You take it with you; it’s under your fingernails; it’s in the hair follicles; it’s {{in the way you}} smile; it’s in the ride of your hips, in the passage of your breasts; it’s all there, no matter where you go. You can take on the affectations and the postures of other places and even learn to speak their ways. But <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is,</b> home is between your teeth.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> that Puerto Rican liberal {{interests}} benefited {{directly from}} the Cánovas assassination, since by Cánovas' death a pact made (previous to the event) between the new Spanish prime minister, Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, and Puerto Rican liberals headed by Luis Muñoz Rivera would come into effect soon after. It allowed {{the establishment of a}} new autonomy charter for the island territory, which gave Puerto Rico broader political powers {{than at any other time}} before or since.|$|E

5|$|Historian Tim Newark unraveled {{the myth}} {{in his book}} Mafia Allies. A version that is {{probably}} closer to <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> that Vizzini simply led a delegation of locals to meet an Allied patrol whose commander had asked to speak to whoever was in charge. He quotes local historian, Luigi Lumia, who described how a procession of people with Calogero Vizzini at the helm made its way towards the tanks chanting: 'Long Live America', 'Long Live the Mafia', 'Long Live Don Calo'. Vizzini {{was taken to a}} command post outside Villalba and was interrogated about a recent firefight involving an American jeep on patrol. When Vizzini {{made it clear that the}} Italian soldiers had fled and the firefight had been caused by exploding ammunition, the frustrated US army official took his rage out in a stream of obscenities. Vizzini was utterly embarrassed by the incident and ordered his interpreter not to tell anybody what had happened.|$|E
