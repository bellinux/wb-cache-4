5|$|Also {{benefiting from}} the {{offensive}} line's strength was Tech quarterback Bryan Randall. Randall finished <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season with 1,957passing yards and 12passing touchdowns, completing 140 of his 225passes during the process.

5|$|At {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season, {{the team}} which has the most points is awarded the title of regular season champion. The league in the past {{generally}} takes a several week break between <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season and postseason. As with <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season, {{the format of the}} playoffs has varied from year to year. In the 2009–10 season the top four teams advanced to the playoffs and play two best-of-five rounds. The league scheduled the end of <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season and postseason around the Olympic break. In each round the higher ranked team from <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season will receive a home-ice advantage and the series will begin play and have the majority of games play in their rink.|$|E
5|$|Casey's {{favorite}} {{target was}} wide receiver Sidney Snell, who caught a Tech-record eight touchdown receptions during <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season.

50|$|General Howe led {{the light}} {{infantry}} companies and grenadiers in {{the assault on}} the American left flank, expecting an easy effort against Stark's recently arrived troops. His light infantry were set along the narrow beach, in column, in order to turn the far left flank of the colonial position. The grenadiers were deployed in the middle. They lined up four deep and several hundred across. As <b>the</b> <b>regulars</b> closed, John Simpson, a New Hampshire man, prematurely fired, drawing an ineffective volley of return fire from <b>the</b> <b>regulars.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>regulars</b> finally closed within range, both sides opened fire. The colonists inflicted heavy casualties on <b>the</b> <b>regulars,</b> using <b>the</b> fence to steady and aim their muskets, and benefit from a modicum of cover. With this devastating barrage of musket fire, <b>the</b> <b>regulars</b> retreated in disarray, and the militia held their ground.|$|R
25|$|In {{support of}} <b>the</b> <b>regulars,</b> <b>the</b> Afghan command {{expected}} {{to call out}} the tribes, which could gather up to 20,000 or 30,000 fighters in the Khyber region alone. In stark contrast to <b>the</b> <b>regulars,</b> <b>the</b> tribal lashkars were probably the best troops that the Afghans had, being of excellent fighting quality, well armed, mainly with weapons that they had made themselves or stolen from the garrisons and with plenty of ammunition.|$|R

5|$|Defensively, the Virginia Tech Hokies {{allowed an}} average of 308 yards per game and 18.4 points per game. During {{the last two games}} of <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season, however, the Hokies {{permitted}} 34 points and 42 points to Rutgers and Virginia, respectively. The Virginia Tech defense was led by two strong performers in the defensive secondary. Safety Torrian Gray intercepted four passes during <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season, returning one of the catches for a touchdown. He tied with cornerback William Yarborough for the most interceptions on the team during <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season. Neither player was the team's leading tackler, however. That honor went to linebacker George DelRicco, who had 130 tackles during <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season.|$|E
5|$|During the 2nd century some {{units with}} the new names numerus ("group") and vexillatio ("detachment") appear in the diploma record. Their size is uncertain, but was likely smaller than <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> alae and cohortes, as {{originally}} they were probably detachments from the latter, acquiring independent status after long-term separation. As these units are mentioned in diplomas, they were presumably part of <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> auxiliary organisation. But numeri was also a generic term used for barbarian units outside <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> auxilia. (see section 2.4 Irregular units, below).|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season, Virginia Tech's offense outscored opponents by {{an average}} of 31points per game.

Important to that success was running back Shyrone Stith, who had 1,119rushing yards during <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season. Even more important to the Hokies' success, however, was quarterback Michael Vick.|$|E

5|$|The Volunteers' rushing offense {{had been}} led by Aaron Hayden during <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season, but Hayden broke his leg during Tennessee's final regular season game. Due to the injury, James Stewart was {{forecast}} {{to start the}} game at running back for the Volunteers. During <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season, Tennessee was ranked No. 13 in rushing, accumulating an average of 231.2 rushing yards per game. Stewart accounted for 93.5 yards of that total, having carried the ball 170 times for 1,028 yards and 11 touchdowns during <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season. One of Tennessee's other backup running backs, Jay Graham, was predicted to be {{kept out of the}} game due to an injury, but played after undergoing surgery. Graham, who rushed 61 times for 275 yards during <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season, suffered a broken jaw after being punched in the face by a teammate. Because of the injury to Graham, fourth-string running back Ronnie Pillow, who had carried the ball just five times during <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season, was predicted to back up Stewart during the game.|$|E

50|$|During {{that time}} <b>the</b> <b>Regulars</b> {{operated}} {{out of the}} four main U.S. bases in the area: Camp Ramadi, Blue Diamond, Corregidor, and COP Dealer.

5|$|A {{decade after}} Virginia Tech's {{selection}} the 1995 Sugar Bowl {{and five years}} after its appearance in a Sugar Bowl game {{that served as the}} national championship game, Tech was again selected to play in New Orleans' annual Sugar Bowl game.

Normally, Auburn's undefeated season would have been justification for a spot in the 2005 BCS National Championship Game, but because two other teams had also gone undefeated during <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season, Auburn, as the No. 3 team in the country, was left out of the National Championship game.|$|E
