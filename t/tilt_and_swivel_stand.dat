50|$|The screen {{itself was}} a 14 inch CRT mounted on a <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> <b>swivel</b> <b>stand.</b> It offered a {{resolution}} of 800 by 500, {{and a number of}} different glyphs could be used to produce 25 lines or either 80 or 132 columns of text, the 25th line normally being used to display status codes, like caps lock, generated locally in the terminal. The VT330 had two bit-planes that produced 4 shades of grey, while the VT340 had four bit-planes to produce 16 colors out of a palette of 4096.|$|E

50|$|The LCD {{moves around}} two axes which {{are at a}} right angle to each other, so that the screen both <b>tilts</b> <b>and</b> <b>swivels.</b> This type is called swivel screen. Other names for this type are vari-angle screen, fully {{articulated}} screen, fully articulating screen, rotating screen, multi-angle screen, variable angle screen, flip-out-and-twist screen, twist-and-tilt screen and swing-and-tilt screen.|$|R
5000|$|Compared to its predecessor, the 380EX, it {{provided}} slightly more power, an improved autofocus assist beam, <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> <b>swivel</b> (the 380EX could only <b>tilt),</b> <b>and</b> {{the ability to}} serve as a slave in Canon's wireless multiple-flash system. [...] Like the 380EX, the 420EX did not provide user controls (other than enabling and disabling high-speed sync); any flash-related settings, such as exposure compensation or second-curtain synchronization, had to be set using the body.|$|R

This feature is found on most narrowbody aircraft, but many airlines have chosen to omit them on many newer widebody aircraft (such as the Boeing777).|$|R
40|$|I Two University OIE Michigan {{engineers}} were videotaped and timed as they co 1 labor;zted i n set t ing up an NCR PC- 8, a personal computer, {{based on the}} Intel 80286 processor, Their dialog, a resul t of the subjects-in-tandem method u!;ed here, identified weaknesses in the current setup procedure. In the f i r s t of two sessions, participants unpacked the system unit, then unpacked and installed t h e keyboard, graphics card, RAM expansion, co-processo~:, and display.

Participants spent another hour and a half unpacking the <b>til,t</b> <b>and</b> <b>swivel</b> mechanism, instal l ing t h e fee t, checking the key lock, running the demonstration program, duplicating a DOS disk, set t ing up the hard disk, and copying f i l e s t o it...|$|R

During an external cargo operation, an empty net <b>and</b> <b>swivel</b> dislodged during flight resulting in an uncommanded dropped load (SAFECOM 11 - 0592).

50|$|Couplers are the {{fittings}} which {{hold the}} tubes together. The most common are called scaffold couplers, {{and there are}} three basic types: right-angle couplers, putlog couplers <b>and</b> <b>swivel</b> couplers. To join tubes end-to-end joint pins (also called spigots) or sleeve couplers are used. Only right angle couplers <b>and</b> <b>swivel</b> couplers {{can be used to}} fix tube in a 'load-bearing connection'. Single couplers are not load-bearing couplers and have no design capacity.|$|R
5000|$|As {{explained}} {{above in}} [...] "Ball and socket", {{the movement in}} the coupler and ball combination is limited to mostly horizontal movement <b>and</b> <b>tilting</b> slightly. Therefore, this type of coupling is best suited for three-wheeled motorcycles and four-wheeled vehicles. In contrast, as pivot ball hitches <b>and</b> <b>swivel</b> adapters do allow the appreciable lean necessary to keep all the trailer wheels on the ground while turning, these devices are the better option for towing trailers behind a two-wheeled motorcycle.|$|R

Similar AT&T Picturephone units were also featured at the Telephone Pavilion (also called the [...] "Bell Telephone Pavilion") at Expo 67, an International World's Fair held in Montreal, Canada in 1967.

40|$|By {{presenting}} oriented Gabor patches either monocularly or binocularly, we dissociated retinal orientation from perceived <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> perceived slant. After {{adapting to}} binocular patches, with zero apparent <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> non-zero slant, small <b>tilt</b> after-effects (TAEs) <b>and</b> large slant after-effects (SAE) were measured. Adapting to monocular patches with non-zero <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> zero slant produced large TAEs and smaller SAEs. This {{pattern of results}} suggests that a common, low-level adaptation to monocular orientation is involved in slant <b>and</b> <b>tilt</b> after-effects. However, the incomplete transfer between slant <b>and</b> <b>tilt</b> {{makes it clear that}} higher-level adaptation is also involved, perhaps at the level of surface representation...|$|R
