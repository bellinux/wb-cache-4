5|$|Ideas {{from the}} Deep convened {{to come up}} with the design for the game, and Hall {{suggested}} a console-style platformer in the vein of Super Mario Bros., as they had the technology made for it; he further recommended a science fiction theme. John Carmack added the idea of a genius child protagonist saving the world, and Hall quickly created a short summary for the game: a dramatic introduction about eight-year-old genius Billy Blaze, defending the Earth with his spaceship. When he read out the summary in an over-dramatic voice to the group, <b>they</b> <b>laughed</b> and applauded, and the group agreed to begin work on Commander Keen in the Invasion of the Vorticons.|$|E

The band played mostly blues and ballads, but the most popular music among whites in the area was country. Berry wrote, [...] "Curiosity provoked me to lay {{a lot of our}} country stuff on our predominantly black audience and some of our black audience began whispering 'who is that black hillbilly at the Cosmo?' After <b>they</b> <b>laughed</b> at me a few times they began requesting the hillbilly stuff and enjoyed dancing to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Orr is {{also well}} known for his {{charitable}} works, although he kept mention of {{them out of the}} press. Former Eagle-Tribune writer Russ Conway noted of one occasion when Orr and Conway visited Boston Children's Hospital, with a box of programs, pennants, pucks, pictures and Boston memorabilia: [...] "We went from room to room, Orr popping in, unannounced to visit the kids. Some couldn't believe their eyes; sick as they were, <b>they</b> <b>laughed</b> in astonishment and delight. Bobby Orr! He talked and joked with every one of them, asking names, rubbing heads, giving everybody a little present from the box, leaving a stick, autographing everything in sight." [...] Orr made Conway promise to not print a word in the newspaper. Orr was involved in numerous charity fund raisers. In 1980, Orr was awarded the Multiple Sclerosis Silver Hope Chest Award by the Multiple Sclerosis Society for his [...] "numerous and unselfish contributions to society".|$|E

500|$|The Los Angeles Times film critic, Charles Champlin, {{explained}} that the Director's Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival [...] "came into being {{as one of the}} consequences of the political turmoil that aborted the festival in 1968. It is designed to make the festival a less than totally establishment affair and it offers Third World, independent and frequently angry films on social themes." [...] He further {{explained that}} Carradine's Americana was [...] "an ideal selection for the fortnight." [...] In fact, the film won the People's Choice Award there in 1981. Film columnist Christopher Hicks stated that Americana was also warmly received at the 1981 United States Film and Video Festival in Park City, Utah. [...] This was the third of such events which would later become known as the Sundance Film Festival. Carradine said of the audience's reaction to the film, [...] "Well, <b>they</b> <b>laughed</b> in all the right places, and they applauded at the end, so I guess it went alright." [...] He also said, [...] "Americana swept the festival and I came very close to making a distribution deal with Warner Brothers." [...] However, the Associated Press described Americanas reception in Utah as [...] "quiet".|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Vig and Manson met at {{the funeral}} of Pablo Castelaz, the six-year-old son of Dangerbird Records founder Jeff Castelaz, and had a {{conversation}} where, according to Vig, [...] "we felt like we had some unfinished business, and we realized how precious life is and how important music has been in our lives." [...] Manson suggested calling guitarists Duke Erikson and Steve Marker {{to get together and}} write some songs. One week later, the group informally convened in Los Angeles, where <b>they</b> <b>laughed,</b> drank, and reminisced of the old days, leaving behind the tensions among them and general weariness that was partly responsible for their 2005 breakup; they set up their equipment and [...] "started fucking around." [...] "We were all pleased to notice on the first day there just didn't seem to be any personal tensions," [...] Vig recalled. [...] "Enough time had passed that any sort of weirdness or tension that had risen between us all had dissipated. So it was easy. There was no one telling us what to do. We weren't signed to a label. We were between managers. So we made this on our own terms." [...] In that session, the group wrote the song [...] "Battle In Me".|$|E

2500|$|During {{a session}} from the Pink Friday Diaries, Minaj {{discussed}} {{the song in}} detail, adding a background story to the original song. [...] "Moment 4 Life : is about 2 kids that {{grew up on the}} same block. They shared their dreams of making it as rappers. <b>They</b> <b>laughed</b> together, they cried together. One day they realize that their dreams have come to fruition. Though they know all things come to an end, they celebrate. They wish that they could have this moment 4 Life." [...] Lyrically the song is about a desire to maintain a feeling of accomplishment, as Drake follows behind Minaj and raps the same theme of enjoying the moment. [...] "Straying away from the standard rap song construction of three verses and a hook, Nicki performs a brain-dump of sorts on the track, spitting as if she’s making a speech to both her fans and detractors." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} the {{generation}} of the dispersion has no portion {{in the world to}} come.. The Gemara asked what they did to justify this punishment. The scholars of the academy of Rav Shila taught that they sought to build a tower, ascend to heaven, and cleave it with axes, that its waters might gush forth. In the academies of the Land of Israel, <b>they</b> <b>laughed</b> at this, arguing that if {{the generation of}} the dispersion had sought to do so, they should have built the tower on a mountain. Rabbi Jeremiah bar Eleazar taught that the generation of the dispersion split into three parties. One party sought to ascend to heaven and dwell there. The second party sought to ascend to heaven and serve idols. And the third party sought to ascend and wage war with God. God scattered the party that proposed to ascend and dwell there. God turned into apes, spirits, devils, and night-demons the party that sought to ascend and wage war with God. As for the party that sought to ascend and serve idols, God responded, in the words of [...] "for there the Lord did confound the language of all the earth."

Rav taught that the atmosphere of the tower caused forgetfulness. Rav Joseph taugh that Babylon and the neighboring city of Borsif were both evil omens for the Torah, because one soon forgets one's learning there.
