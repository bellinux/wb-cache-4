25|$|Attorney General Richard Thornburgh had {{previously}} warned Bush that replacing Thurgood Marshall, who was widely revered {{as a civil}} rights icon, with any candidate who was not perceived to share Marshall's views would make <b>the</b> <b>confirmation</b> <b>process</b> difficult.

25|$|WSDOT is {{overseen by}} the Governor of Washington, who {{appoints}} a Secretary of Transportation that is confirmed by the state legislature. The last Secretary of Transportation was Lynn Peterson, who served on an interim basis until February 5, 2016, when her appointment under Governor Jay Inslee {{was rejected by the}} Washington State Senate during <b>the</b> <b>confirmation</b> <b>process.</b> Deputy Secretary of Transportation Roger Millar was appointed as Acting Secretary of Transportation by Governor Inslee on February 10, 2016.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2005, {{it was assumed that}} the Democrats would {{filibuster}} any Supreme Court nominee who would change the ideological composition of the court. Initially, this conjecture seemed to be borne out when conservative jurist John Roberts was renominated to replace conservative Chief Justice Rehnquist. <b>The</b> <b>confirmation</b> <b>process</b> went relatively smoothly with no threat of a filibuster. Later, however, the hypothesis was disproved. When Bush chose another conservative appellate judge, Samuel Alito, to replace moderate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, opponents of Alito could not generate enough votes to prevent cloture from being invoked on his nomination. Very soon afterward, he was successfully confirmed.|$|E

40|$|The Supreme Court is the {{ultimate}} interpreter {{of the meaning of}} the law in the United States. For this reason, nominations and confirmations of Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States have always been an important process. By being able to distinguish <b>the</b> <b>confirmation</b> <b>processes</b> for these nominees from one another, a more complete comprehension of the nomination process as a whole will further the understanding of the court, as well as its interactions with the other branches of the American government. The objective of this thesis is to compare and contrast <b>the</b> <b>confirmation</b> <b>processes</b> of Justices Roberts and Alito, exploring the reasons why the senate roll call vote for the two justices were so different, even though both candidates were confirmed. Justice Roberts was confirmed 78 - 22, while Justice Alito was confirmed by a 58 - 42 vote. What accounts for this startling 20 -vote difference in the senate’s voting? Essentially, the central hypothesis of the thesis is that several factors contributed to the greater divisions surrounding Alito’s <b>confirmation</b> versus <b>the</b> relative consensus by which Roberts was chosen, despite the fact that both are considered to be strong conservative judges. These factors include the character and personality of th...|$|R
25|$|In {{two cases}} Filbinger saved {{opponents of the}} regime from execution: He {{interfered}} in <b>the</b> <b>confirmation</b> <b>process</b> of the case of military chaplain Möbius, who had been sentenced to death for a political statement. The case was reopened in spring 1945 and Möbius subsequently acquitted. As prosecutor in the case against Lieutenant Forstmeier, who had made some remarks about the July 20 Plot, he influenced the witnesses to testimonies, that could be interpreted in the defendant's favour, prolonged the proceedings and obtained a verdict of demotion and imprisonment on parole. Forstmeier {{was supposed to be}} sent to frontline combat, but {{the end of the war}} prevented this.|$|E
25|$|Marshall {{had been}} the first African American Justice on the Court, and while the {{appointment}} of Thomas would preserve the existing racial composition of the Court, it was seen as likely to move its ideological balance to the right. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh had previously warned Bush that replacing Thurgood Marshall, who was widely revered as a civil rights icon, with any candidate who was not perceived to share Marshall's views would make <b>the</b> <b>confirmation</b> <b>process</b> difficult. Civil rights and feminist organizations opposed Thomas' appointment, partially citing Thomas' criticism of affirmative action and also because they were suspicious that Thomas might not be a supporter of Roe v. Wade.|$|E
25|$|In modern times, <b>the</b> <b>confirmation</b> <b>process</b> has {{attracted}} considerable {{attention from the}} press and advocacy groups, which lobby senators to confirm or to reject a nominee depending on whether their track record aligns with the group's views. The Senate Judiciary Committee conducts hearings and votes on whether the nomination {{should go to the}} full Senate with a positive, negative or neutral report. The committee's practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent. The first nominee to appear before the committee was Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925, who sought to quell concerns about his links to Wall Street, and the modern practice of questioning began with John Marshall Harlan II in 1955. Once the committee reports out the nomination, the full Senate considers it. Rejections are relatively uncommon; the Senate has explicitly rejected twelve Supreme Court nominees, most recently Robert Bork, nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1987.|$|E
50|$|Hughes' {{nomination}} was opposed by progressives and southern Democrats, and also {{due to his}} age. At 67, Hughes was the oldest man ever nominated as Chief Justice. He survived <b>the</b> contentious <b>confirmation</b> <b>process,</b> accepted {{by a vote of}} 52 to 26.|$|R

500|$|Ginsburg's {{name was}} later invoked during <b>the</b> <b>confirmation</b> <b>process</b> of John Roberts. Ginsburg herself {{was not the}} first nominee to avoid {{answering}} certain specific questions before Congress, and as a young lawyer in 1981 Roberts had advised against Supreme Court nominees giving specific responses. Nevertheless, some conservative commentators and Senators invoked the phrase [...] "Ginsburg precedent" [...] to defend his demurrers. In a September 28, 2005 speech at Wake Forest University, Ginsburg said that Roberts' refusal to answer questions during his Senate confirmation hearings on some cases was [...] "unquestionably right".|$|E
500|$|The {{manner in}} which Andros {{approached}} the issue was necessarily divisive, since it threatened any landowner whose title was in any way dubious. [...] Some landowners went through <b>the</b> <b>confirmation</b> <b>process,</b> but many refused, since {{they did not want}} to face the possibility of losing their land, and they viewed the process as a thinly veiled land grab. [...] The Puritans of Plymouth and Massachusetts, some of whom had extensive landholdings, were among the latter. [...] Since all of the existing land titles in Massachusetts had been granted under the now-vacated colonial charter, Andros essentially declared them to be void, and required landowners to recertify their ownership, paying fees to the dominion and becoming subject to the charging of a quit-rent.|$|E

Although the majority of political supporters emphasized Sotomayor’s individual and professional qualifications as the crucial factors that made her confirmable, what ultimately became confirmed through her appointment was the increasing, if uncomfortable, weight of Latino identity as a relevant category of social difference in contemporary American politics. This essay engages with <b>the</b> <b>confirmation</b> <b>process’s</b> discarded and expanded plotlines to produce an acceptable story, {{in order to understand}} Sotomayor’s appointment not simply as the culmination of Latino achievement or collective empowerment but as a way to assess the current price of the ticket for Latino political incorporation...|$|R

2500|$|On May 17, 2011, Senator Harry Reid filed a cloture motion on Liu's nomination. On May 19, 2011, the Senate {{rejected}} cloture in {{a mostly}} party-line vote of 52–43, with {{all but one}} Democrat (Ben Nelson) voting in favor of cloture and all but one Republican (Lisa Murkowski) voting against. He became the first Obama judicial nominee to be successfully filibustered in the Senate. With {{the makeup of the}} Senate unlikely to change until after the 2012 election, Liu withdrew his name from consideration on May 25, 2011. On July 29, 2011, three days after California Governor Jerry Brown nominated Liu to a seat on the Supreme Court of California, President Obama formally notified the Senate that he was withdrawing Liu's nomination for the 9th Circuit. In a talk before The City Club of Cleveland on February 22, 2013, Liu commented that <b>the</b> <b>confirmation</b> <b>process</b> is [...] "inherently a political process" [...] and [...] "the Constitution was designed to make it a political process." [...] He noted, however, that the problem with <b>the</b> <b>confirmation</b> <b>process</b> is that it has become transformed into requiring 60 votes as opposed to a bare majority, which {{was not part of the}} Constitutional design.|$|E
2500|$|His {{hearings}} {{before the}} judiciary committee began on December 14, and lasted just three consecutive days. When his nomination was voted upon, Kennedy received bipartisan support.

2500|$|Farmer {{publicly}} stated {{his opposition}} to the Bonwit Teller rulings during <b>the</b> <b>confirmation</b> <b>process.</b> In December 1953, Farmer convinced Democratic appointee Ivar Peterson to join Farmer and Rodgers in deciding Livingston Shirt Corp., which overturned Bonwit Teller. Although Peterson agreed with the outcome of the decision, his rationale for reaching the verdict was on much narrower legal grounds. Farmer did not, however, find the employer's right to hold captive audience meetings absolute. [...] In Peerless Plywood Co. Farmer, Rodgers, and Peterson agreed that employers may not hold captive audience meetings within 24 hours of a union representation election. Two years later, in Economic Machinery Co., Farmer led a unanimous board in holding that one-on-one conversations between the employer and employee about the union is inherently coercive.|$|E
