50|$|The eastern facade has two {{centrally}} located windows, of slender rectangular openings fitted with leadlight windows. Tracery divides the rectangular panels into three openings, a lancet-esque opening with tre-foiled arched head and, above this, two smaller tre-foiled shapes. The openings are glazed with diamond mullioned glass. A <b>timber</b> <b>sill</b> projects {{from the base}} of the windows.|$|E
50|$|Posts {{which were}} {{dug into the}} ground are called earthfast or post in ground construction. This {{technique}} eliminated the need for bracing. Some buildings were framed with the posts landing on a foundation with interrupted sills. Most buildings were framed with the posts landing on a heavy <b>timber</b> <b>sill,</b> the sills (rarely) laid on the ground, supported by stones or, late in the 19th century, concrete.|$|E
50|$|There {{are rare}} {{examples}} of historic {{buildings in the}} U.S. where the floor joists land on the foundation and a plank sill or <b>timber</b> <b>sill</b> sit {{on top of the}} joists. Another rare, historic building technique is for the posts of a timber frame building to land directly on a foundation or in the ground and the sills fit between the posts and are called interrupted sills.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Unusual sill framing in a granary of half-timber construction. Long tenons {{project through}} the <b>sill</b> plate. <b>Timber</b> <b>sills</b> can span gaps in a foundation.|$|R
50|$|Original {{terrazzo}} sills {{to former}} ground floor laboratory areas remain. The large timber sash windows to {{the perimeter of}} the building have generous <b>timber</b> <b>sills</b> to the interiors and provide substantial light to offices, laboratories and the rear corridor. Windows to the corridor and east and west elevation retain much of the original blue-green tinted anti-actinic glazing.|$|R
5|$|The west-facing {{front of}} the {{original}} building consists of three bays with a central door. Above the door is an oculus window that originally had glazing bars, with other windows on both sides that have segmented arched heads and <b>timber</b> <b>sills.</b> The original upper floor windows have been replaced in the 19th or 20th century while the ground floor windows are modern but within the original openings.|$|R
50|$|The timber framed {{structure}} has internal aisles {{on both sides}} and both ends and sits on a <b>timber</b> <b>sill</b> supported on a stone plinth or on stone pedestals. It is nine bays long, two of which were added in the late 15th century or early 16th century and is weatherboarded with a tiled hip roof. The main part of the roof is supported on crown post trusses with the aisle roofs formed by raking rafters between the wall studs and the main truss posts.|$|E
50|$|Poteaux-sur-sol (“posts on a sill” Sol is also spelled sole and solle) is a {{style of}} timber framing, in which {{relatively}} closely spaced posts rest on a <b>timber</b> <b>sill.</b> Poteaux-en-terre and pieux-en-terre are similar, but the closely spaced posts extend into the ground rather than resting on a sill on a foundation, and therefore are a type of post in ground construction. Poteaux-sur-sol {{is similar to the}} framing style known in the United Kingdom as close studding. Poteaux-sur-sol has also, confusingly, been used for other types of timber framing which have a sill timber such as post-and-plank, but this is considered incorrect by some scholars.|$|E
50|$|Wide eaves {{overhang}} the verandah {{which has a}} delicately detailed timber valance, dowel balustrades and chamfered timber posts with moulded timber capitals. The verandah has three wide bays with steps centrally located in the middle bay. The wall areas {{either side of the}} verandah are clad with vertical tongue-and-groove timber boards and have small sections of exposed timber cross bracing tucked under the eaves. Each contains a double hung timber sash window. The extensions at each end have skillion roofs, are clad with horizontal weatherboards and each has a timber door and set of steps. At the southern corner, the building has sliding, timber framed, multi-paned windows with coloured glass that return around the corner and continue along the western wall. The eastern corner has a <b>timber</b> <b>sill</b> at the same level as the windows but the windows are along the eastern elevation only. The building is set on concrete stumps with timber batten infill.|$|E
500|$|The bridge has {{undergone}} multiple alterations, but the original piers remain. They were constructed as [...] "four rounded braced wandoo piles supported from horizontal 450mm <b>timber</b> <b>sills,</b> adzed to 400mm, fixed to concrete footings", with the footings designed {{to bear on}} foundation rocks [...] beneath the surface. The bridge's original spans were made up of seven rounded timber wandoo stringers, of at least [...] diameter, bearing on jarrah corbels, supported by jarrah half caps [...] in size. The [...] span over the railway alignment was originally supported on four [...] steel beams, weighing [...] each.|$|R
40|$|Our {{experience}} from site visits is that <b>timber</b> <b>sills</b> are not protected if it rains while {{the house is}} under construction. However, opinions in the building industry are divided as to whether this presents a problem in terms of risk of mould growth. This study {{was carried out in}} order to investigate whether wooden sills and studs can withstand being briefly exposed to water before they are built in {{by the rest of the}} structure, or while they are built in, and whether there is any risk of mould growth...|$|R
50|$|The way {{consisted}} of flat strap iron fastened to continuous <b>timber</b> <b>sills.</b> Much {{of the way}} passed easily through South Carolina's monotonously flat Pine Barrens. Elsewhere, the track was elevated - frequently over long distances - on timber pilings. A drop of 180 ft over a 3800 ft run into Horse Creek Valley required an inclined plane, with a steam-powered winch later replaced by a locomotive used as a counterweight. Delays at this archaic bottleneck brought about the railroad town of Aiken, South Carolina, as a stopover place.|$|R
50|$|The meat {{house is}} located in a cluster of {{buildings}} over 35m {{to the west of the}} house, and adjacent to the tennis court. It has a short-ridge hipped roof, the fourth, north-eastern side of which has been cut back. On the remaining three sides the roof forms an overhang about 2m deep that is supported by timber posts. On the south-western elevation the edge of the roof is finished with a half-metre wide, solid valance of shot-edge timber boards. The building sheltering under the roof sits on a concrete slab-on-ground. The walls are clad in weatherboards to a height off the ground of approximately 600mm. A <b>timber</b> <b>sill</b> separates this from the fine steel mesh, which covers the timber frame above. There are double board doors on the north-eastern elevation. Inside the meat house is divided into two rooms by a wall made with steel mesh fixed to a timber frame. There is a single board door in this wall, which extends only to the height of the top plates of the exterior walls. While the underside of the corrugated iron roof is exposed in the first room entered, in the second there is a tongue-and-groove timber board ceiling. A step in the slab also separates the two spaces. The butcher's blocks are still in place.|$|E
5000|$|The Sturgeon House {{is located}} at the {{intersection}} of Water Street and Avonia Road (Pennsylvania Route 98). The house is a rare example of a saltbox house in northwestern Pennsylvania, as well as a house with a recessed side porch. The house is constructed of [...] "stone foundation walls and topped with heavy <b>timber</b> <b>sills</b> which are notched to receive log form beams." [...] The roof of the house is slanted at an angle of 30 degrees. The front door is framed by a cornice and Federal-style entablature and pilaster.|$|R
5000|$|The bridge has {{undergone}} multiple alterations, but the original piers remain. They were constructed as [...] "four rounded braced wandoo piles supported from horizontal 450mm <b>timber</b> <b>sills,</b> adzed to 400mm, fixed to concrete footings", with the footings designed {{to bear on}} foundation rocks 1+1/2 m beneath the surface. The bridge's original spans were made up of seven rounded timber wandoo stringers, of at least 400 mm diameter, bearing on jarrah corbels, supported by jarrah half caps 600 by 150 mm in size. The 14 m span over the railway alignment was originally supported on four 610 by 190 mm steel beams, weighing 41 kg each.|$|R
50|$|The 4th Earl {{inherited}} the title {{at the age}} of 30. After a Grand Tour he married Grace Carteret, daughter of John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville. He undertook extensive repairs of the house, replacing the roof tiles with slates, rebuilding the bays with venetian windows above, replaced mullions with sash windows, and generally repaired decayed <b>timbers,</b> <b>sills</b> and floors where required. On completion of the structural work the house was extensively redecorated and new furniture added, some of which survives notably the harpsichord and library steps. Despite the modernisation, Lionel also went to great pains to restore and repair much of furniture dating from the Lauderdale's time and this has helped preserve many original features to the present day.|$|R
50|$|The side {{extensions}} are accessed via partially enclosed passageways {{at the back}} of the building. Between the wards and these passageways are lean-to additions with skillion roofs that each contain a further two rooms. At the western end of the building there is also a timber toilet block with terrazzo floors attached at the northern side of the passageway. The western extension contains four equal sized rooms, with three-quarter height, fibrous-cement partitions and lino floors, the eastern extension is divided into five small rooms. The perimeter walls have multi-paned, coloured glass sliding windows and <b>timber</b> <b>sills</b> with tongue and groove lining below. Many of the rooms are furnished with cast iron beds from the sanatorium. Original doors are located in the wall between the former ward and the eastern extension.|$|R
50|$|Two {{concrete}} steps and a recessed concrete paved portico flanked by four Tuscan columns form {{the entrance to}} the building from Mellor Street. Original exterior joinery generally survives to all elevations with original obscure glazing to all fanlights and doors. Windows generally comprise single or paired six-light timber casements with two or four-light fanlights above respectively and <b>timber</b> <b>sills.</b> The bathroom in the south-east corner has a smaller pair of four-light casements. Original doors comprise a six-light French entrance door, a six-light high waist rear door and a four-light high waist female public toilet door, all with four-light fanlights above. Some fanlights have been removed to accommodate air conditioning units with fixed aluminium louvred awnings over and the single casement toilet window on the north-east elevation has been infilled.|$|R
50|$|Internally, the {{building}} has tongue and groove boarding to walls and ceilings, moulded <b>timber</b> architraves and <b>sills,</b> a central masonry strongroom and carpeted timber floors.|$|R
50|$|By the 16th century sawmills {{were coming}} into use in Europe. The {{founding}} of America was partly {{based on a}} desire to extract resources from the new continent including wood for use in ships and buildings in Europe. In the 18th century part of the Industrial Revolution was {{the invention of the}} steam engine and cut nails. These technologies combined with the invention of the circular saw {{led to the development of}} balloon framing which was the beginning of the decline of traditional timber framing.The 19th century saw the development of electrical engineering and distribution which allowed the development of hand-held power tools, wire nails and machines to mass-produce screws. In the 20th century portland cement came into common use and concrete foundations allowed carpenters to do away with heavy <b>timber</b> <b>sills.</b> Also, drywall (plasterboard) came into common use replacing lime plaster on wooden lath. Plywood, engineered lumber and chemically treated lumber also came into use.For types of carpentry used in America see American historic carpentry.|$|R
50|$|The {{raising of}} a meeting-house {{was a great}} event, and people came from the {{surrounding}} towns {{to aid in the}} work. They came early in the morning, with pike-poles and pitch-forks and iron bars,—pike-poles and pitch-forks to lift with when the “broadside “should be well up in the air, and iron bars to hold against the foot of the posts to slide them into the mortises of the sills. On such an occasion there was plenty of rum. The first thing to be done was to take a drink, to give strength for the labor of the day. Then came the bringing together of the <b>timbers.</b> The <b>sills</b> were already laid and levelled. First the posts, then the girts and levers, and lastly the plates.|$|R
50|$|The {{cabin was}} {{constructed}} with large hand-hewn heart of pine timbers. Using a broad axe, the timbers were hewn flat {{on both the}} exterior and the interior sides. The rectangular hewn timbers were typically in excess of seventeen-inches high and six-inches deep. They were stacked horizontally from just above the ground to a height of approximately 12 feet at {{the eve of the}} gabled roof, which ran north to south. On the east side, the eve was just below the top of the chimney. The timbers, some eighteen feet long, were joined at the corners with square notching. The <b>sill</b> <b>timbers</b> were supported at the corners with piers composed of stacked local rocks.|$|R
50|$|The rear of {{the central}} section has a skillion roofed verandah, {{enclosed}} with multi-paned <b>timber</b> windows above <b>sill</b> height, {{either side of a}} central portico. The portico has a parapet with corner pilasters, and an entablature with a wide cornice formed by a projecting eave which aligns with the adjoining verandahs. The pilasters frame a rectangular opening which is flanked by small Tuscan columns. The main roof has bracketed eaves, and narrow leadlight windows are located above the verandah roof, lighting the interior of the Council Chamber behind. The original toilet blocks are extant (with a plant being added to the roof of the northern toilet block) and flank the enclosed side verandahs of the rear central section.|$|R
50|$|This small {{structure}} sits {{adjacent to}} {{the eastern end of}} the toilet block, {{in the vicinity of the}} northern elevation of the house. Its gable roof is clad in corrugated iron, and covered by a flowering vine. There is a timber board door in the eastern facade. On the northern and southern facades are a series of square glass panes in <b>timber</b> frames. The <b>sill</b> height for these windows is approximately 1.2m high. Below this level the walls are made concrete, in which the outlines of formwork are still visible. On the eastern and western building faces, the gable ends above this level are filled with painted brick. The timber bargeboards are also simply scalloped.|$|R
50|$|Additional roof-top {{accommodation}} for {{laboratories and}} staff, and staff and student common rooms {{was constructed in}} 1949. In the 1960s the University of Queensland erected a freestanding building (design by James Birrell) to the northeast, connecting with a walkway to the College level of the earlier building. A small brick extension was erected in the courtyard in 1985. Aggressive refurbishment of the fabric, furniture, fittings and equipment of the Hospital facilities and College surgeries and teaching areas was undertaken from 1997 to 1999. The integrity of the planning has survived along with some internal fabric including the entrance doors and surrounding panelling, <b>timber</b> casement windows, <b>sills,</b> doors, shelving, corridor finishes and three sets of terrazzo stairs. Servicing of surgeries and work areas continues to be facilitated by the mezzanine service floor.|$|R
5000|$|The Garrett White House is a late Georgian house, {{near the}} {{community}} of Trap in Bertie County, North Carolina, about six miles (10 km) west of the Chowan River, shortly before it becomes the Albemarle Sound. The late-Georgian architecture is [...] "relatively rare in Bertie County, where Federal and Greek Revival period buildings predominated." [...] The plantation house was built originally on the hall and parlor plan. It was remodelled less than twenty years later, when the Hope Mansion was built and the Federal style became fashionable in the Albemarle region. Most of the earlier woodwork and chimney pieces were reused, but the house was given the central hall plan it has today. The house retains all of its original woodwork {{and some of its}} plaster. The pier structure has been retained, so the massive <b>sill</b> <b>timbering</b> is easily viewed.|$|R
