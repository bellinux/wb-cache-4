5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
500|$|Ward got the {{opportunity}} to prove himself in spring football practice in May 1932. According to one account, Kipke ordered his veterans to pound Ward [...] "without mercy" [...] during practice. [...] "If, {{at the end of}} the week", said Kipke, [...] "he doesn't turn in his uniform, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> I've got a great player." [...] The United Press reported on the results of spring practice: “Three young freshmen at the University of Michigan—Jerry Ford, of Grand Rapids; Russell Oliver, of Pontiac, and Willis Ward, Detroit Negro—displayed such brilliance during spring football practice that they are expected to become important cogs next fall in the Wolverine varsity eleven.” Another report in July 1932 described Ward, the “giant negro,” as being “the outstanding athlete becoming eligible for play.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Osborne {{was a great}} fan of Max Miller and saw {{parallels}} between them. 'I love him, (Max Miller) because he embodied a kind of theatre I admire most. 'Mary from the Dairy' was an overture to the danger that (Max) might go too far. Whenever anyone tells me that a scene or a line in a play of mine goes too far in some way <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> my instinct has been functioning as it should. When such people tell you that a particular passage makes the audience uneasy or restless, then they seem (to me) as cautious and absurd as landladies and girls-who-won't.' ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Actually, I {{must also}} be criticised. I am {{not afraid of the}} {{criticism}} concerning what I do wrong, because <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> If you say the king cannot be criticised, it means that the king is not human. [...] If the king can do no wrong, it is akin to looking down upon him, because the king is not being treated as a human being. But the king can do wrong....If someone offers criticisms suggesting that the king is wrong, then I would like to be informed of their opinion. If I am not, that could be problematic... If we hold that the king cannot be criticised or violated, then the king ends up in a difficult situation." ...|$|E
2500|$|During his 2005 {{birthday}} speech, Bhumibol invited criticism: [...] "Actually, I {{must also}} be criticised. I am not afraid if the criticism concerns what I do wrong, because <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> Because if you say the king cannot be criticised, {{it means that the}} king is not human", he claimed. [...] "If the king can do no wrong, it is akin to looking down upon him because the king is not being treated as a human being. But the king can do wrong." [...] A widespread barrage of criticisms resulted, followed by a sharp rise in lèse-majesté prosecutions. Lèse-majesté cases rose from five or six a year pre-2005 to 478 in 2010.|$|E
