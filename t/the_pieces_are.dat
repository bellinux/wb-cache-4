5|$|Deep frying {{requires}} a deep fryer or other device {{in which the}} chicken pieces can be completely submerged in hot fat. The process of deep frying is basically placing food fully in oil and then cooking it {{at a very high}} temperature. <b>The</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> prepared as described above. The fat is heated in the deep fryer to the desired temperature. <b>The</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> added to the fat and a constant temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process.|$|E
5|$|By convention, {{the game}} pieces {{are divided into}} white and black sets, and the players are {{referred}} to as White and Black respectively. Each player begins the game with 16 pieces of the specified color, which consist of one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. <b>The</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> set out as shown in the diagram and photo, with each queen on a square of its own color, the white queen on a light square and the black queen on a dark.|$|E
5|$|Since 1994, the Crown Jewels {{have been}} {{on display in the}} Jewel House in the Waterloo Block. Some of <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> used {{regularly}} by the Queen. The display includes 23,578 gemstones, the 800-year-old Coronation Spoon, St. Edward's Crown (worn during all crownings at Westminster Abbey) and the Imperial State Crown.|$|E
5000|$|In 1993 <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> {{surveyed}} {{as part of}} the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! survey. At {{the time}} of survey, <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> described as needing treatment.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> {{commissioned}} in 2011 by the Adams Public Library after Greg Mendez had {{an exhibition}} of {{his work at the}} Decatur library. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> installed in October 2011.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> in five movements, {{three of}} them purely instrumental; the central {{interlude}} is for baritone and piano, and the finale features all the performers. The dedicatee of <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> Erik Satie.|$|R
5|$|The {{finite element}} method is an {{important}} numerical method to solve partial differential equations, widely applied in simulating complex physical systems. It attempts to approximate the solution to some equation by piecewise linear functions, where <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> chosen {{with respect to a}} sufficiently fine grid, which in turn can be recast as a matrix equation.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} a {{distinct}} royal jewel collection is vague, {{though it is}} believed the jewels have their origin somewhere in the 16thcentury. Many of <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> from overseas and {{were brought to the}} United Kingdom as a result of civil war, coups and revolutions, or acquired as gifts to the monarch. Most of the jewellery dates from the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E
5|$|To {{appeal to}} its broad {{consumer}} base, the Alrov Group presents changing exhibits of sculpture and art along the promenade. All <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> by local artists, {{and most are}} for sale. During the summer and Jewish holidays, the mall hosts free concerts, street performances, folk dancing, and family activities. During Hanukkah, a Chabad candle-lighting ceremony takes place here nightly.|$|E
50|$|Melodically, <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> mostly {{composed}} {{of one and}} two octave major and minor triadic arpeggios within the key of D major. The last half of <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> {{composed of}} various minor and diminished arpeggios.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Acconci {{completed}} Waterfall Out & In, a {{water feature}} at the visitors' {{center of the}} Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Part of <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> indoors and part of <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> outdoors.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> {{written to}} evoke {{images of the}} idyll, and does so by {{employing}} many extended string techniques, such as harmonics and glissandi. The dynamic range is wide, with rapid changes, and <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> rhythmically very complex.|$|R
5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{consists of}} setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game– for example, {{where to place}} different pieces– while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver. These {{two parts of the}} chess-playing process cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play. A game of chess is normally divided into three phases: opening, typically the first 10 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle; then middlegame; and last the endgame, when most of <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> gone, kings typically take a more active part in the struggle, and pawn promotion is often decisive.|$|E
5|$|The Modern Benoni {{is one of}} Black's sharpest {{and most}} active defences against 1.d4. The {{exchange}} of White's c-pawn for Black's e-pawn leaves White with a pawn majority in the centre and Black with one on the queenside. This asymmetry suggests that White will try {{to play on the}} kingside and in the centre, while Black will seek counterplay on the queenside. However, this simplistic generalization does not hold in many cases—depending on how <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> arranged, either side may be able to fight back on the flank where they are theoretically weaker.|$|E
5|$|The album has a melodic form, and employs pentatonic {{scales for}} melodic development, a {{practice}} common in African and African-American folk music. Goin' Home is mostly tempoless, {{as most of}} <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> performed in a rubato-like free rhythm. Shepp and Parlan perform sudden accelerations and intended delays and halts, particularly {{at the end of}} bars, phrases, and sections in a piece. Most of the spirituals have a thirty-two-bar form, with the eight-bar section comprising four two-bar phrases wherein two choruses of the spiritual are played. Shepp and Parlan's interpretations include few choruses from the original spirituals.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>piece</b> {{has also}} <b>been</b> used in {{numerous}} venues as inspirational music for athletes. At {{the opening ceremony}} of the 2012 Summer Olympics, <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> used in a parody London Symphony Orchestra performance featuring Rowan Atkinson, in character as Mr. Bean. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> played during every victory ceremony at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> first {{published}} by the Parisian firm Durand in 1929. Arrangements of <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>were</b> made for piano solo and piano duet (two people playing at one piano), and Ravel himself arranged a version for two pianos, published in 1930.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> 35 minutes long.|$|R
5|$|The bronzes of Igbo-Ukwu pay special {{attention}} to detail depicting birds, snails, chameleons, and other natural aspects of the world such as a hatching bird. Other pieces include gourds and vessels which were often given handles. <b>The</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> so fine that small insects were included on the surfaces of some while others have what looks like bronze wires decorated around them. None of these extra details were made separately; the bronzes were all one piece. Igbo-Ukwu gave the evidence of an early bronze casting tradition in Nri.|$|E
5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces {{have been added to the}} hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E
5|$|The Louvre is {{involved}} in controversies that surround cultural property seized under Napoleon I, as well as during World War II by the Nazis. During Nazi occupation, thousands of artworks were stolen. But after the war, 61,233 articles of more than 150,000 seized artworks returned to France and {{were assigned to the}} Louvre's Office des Biens Privés. In 1949, it entrusted 2,130 unclaimed pieces (including 1,001 paintings) to the Direction des Musées de France in order to keep them under appropriate conditions of conservation until their restitution and meanwhile classified them as MNRs (Musées Nationaux Recuperation or, in English, the National Museums of Recovered Artwork). Some 10% to 35% of <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> believed to come from Jewish spoliations and until the identification of their rightful owners, which declined {{at the end of the}} 1960s, they are registered indefinitely on separate inventories from the museum's collections.|$|E
50|$|The James Cardinal Gibbons Memorial Statue was {{authorized}} by Congress and President Calvin Coolidge on April 23, 1928. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> commissioned by <b>the</b> Knights of Columbus and cost, at no expense to the United States, $35,998. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> unveiled on August 14, 1932.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> {{in triple meter}} (3/8) and {{is marked}} larghetto (fairly slow) and pianissimo (very soft). <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> in bar form and its {{original}} key is E-flat major. It starts with both hands playing broken triads softly and slowly in treble clef.|$|R

5|$|E.T. is an {{adventure}} {{game in which}} players control an alien (E.T.) from a top-down perspective. The objective {{of the game is}} to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone. <b>The</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> found scattered randomly throughout various pits (also referred to as wells). The player is provided with an on-screen energy bar, which decreases when E.T. performs any actions (including moving, teleporting, or falling into a pit, as well as levitating back to the top). To prevent this, E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces, which are used to restore his energy or, when nine are collected, E.T. can call Elliott to obtain a piece of the telephone, or the player can save the candy pieces for bonus points at the end. After the three phone pieces have been collected, the player must guide E.T. to an area where he can use the phone, which allows him to call his home planet. When the call is made, E.T. must reach the spaceship in a given time limit. Once E.T. gets to the forest where his ship abandoned him and stands and waits in the designated area for the ship to come, the ship will appear on screen and take him back to his home planet. Then the game starts over, with the same difficulty level, while changing the location of the telephone pieces. The score obtained during the round is carried over to the next iteration. The game ends when the energy bar depletes. E.T. has three lives and if he dies within those three lives Elliot will come in and revive him. E.T. can get a fourth life if the player is lucky enough to find a geranium in one of the wells. It turns into a sprite from some games that Howard Scott Warshaw made, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark.|$|E
25|$|In some reconstructions, <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> {{cylindrical}} {{with one}} end painted black for player A and white for player B. Undalled pieces are turned with the painted end down.|$|E

25|$|Xiangqi {{is played}} on a board nine lines wide and ten lines long. As in the game Go (Wéiqí 圍棋/围棋), <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> placed on the intersections, which are known as points. The {{vertical}} lines are known as files (columns), and the horizontal lines are known as ranks (rows).|$|E
25|$|Wizard's Chess {{is played}} with pieces and a board {{identical}} to Chess. The rules are also unchanged. <b>The</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> magically animated, and they violently attack {{each other when}} performing a capture, by knocking the captured piece out and dragging it off the board. The players order the pieces to move using algebraic chess notation.|$|E
25|$|After <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> {{removed from}} the kiln and fully cooled, they are {{inspected}} for cracks or other defects. Then, the flushing mechanism may be installed on a one-piece toilet. On a two-piece toilet with a separate tank, the flushing mechanism may only be placed into the tank, with final assembly at installation.|$|E
