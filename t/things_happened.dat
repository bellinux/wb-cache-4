We had power over the movement of our limbs. We made up our own words and sang them and we danced to them. But there came a time when this power was taken from us....

25|$|Under {{pressure}} of public outcry and critics, January 1999 the Sangha Supreme Council started an {{investigation in the}} accusations, led by Luang Por Ñanavaro, Chief of the ฺGreater Bangkok Region. The Sangha Council declared that Wat Phra Dhammakaya had not broken any serious offenses against monastic discipline (Vinaya) that were cause for defrocking (removal from monkhood), but four directives were given for the temple to improve itself: setting up an Abhidhamma school, more focus on vipassana meditation, and strict adherence {{to the rules of}} the Vinaya and regulations of the Sangha Council. One of the accusations Luang Por Ñanavaro investigated, was that Luang Por Dhammajayo had moved land donated to the temple to his own name. Wat Phra Dhammakaya denied this, stating that it was the intention of the donors to give the land to the abbot, and not the temple. Nevertheless, Luang Por Ñanavaro asked the Religious Affairs Department to assist Luang Por Dhammajayo in returning the land to the temple. The abbot stated he was willing to transfer the land, but this required some time, because it required negotiation with the original donors. When by May the temple had not moved all the land yet, a number of <b>things</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E

The scene depicts Jenner returning to his apartment after seeing Cavallari's limousine off to Europe.

That month, she also expressed interest in participating in a potential reunion film.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written to humanize Sawyer {{and set up}} the love {{triangle}} between him, Kate and Jack.

[...] The episode also shows the moral ambiguity of some characters by revealing more of their personalities, with the ones introduced as protagonists doing things that are generally not viewed as protagonist-like– an example being Jack beating Sawyer and eventually asking Sayid to torture him; and an antagonistic character, Sawyer, proving not to be solely antagonist-like– an example being his backstory and flashback, which show that he is not exclusively evil. Lindelof explained that he wanted Sawyer to [...] "come out of his shell a little, and say to the audience, 'you're supposed to like this guy'", further explaining, [...] "the root of him being an asshole is that these horrible <b>things</b> <b>happened</b> to him {{when he was a little}} kid, and he's really really angry." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{sessions}} for the album began with strife and tension. Bassist Jeff Ament wasn't made {{aware that the}} band was recording until three days into the sessions, {{and said that he}} [...] "wasn't super involved with that record on any level." [...] Guitarist Mike McCready said, [...] "I'm sure Jeff was pissed, but it was more about separating, because if we played all together nothing would get done. We'd all just get pissed off at each other." [...] At one point Ament even walked out of the recording sessions, and considered quitting the band due to lead vocalist Eddie Vedder's control of the creation process. Due to Pearl Jam balancing recording and touring, Irons commented that the band was [...] "more on-the-fly during the making of No Code, and some good <b>things</b> <b>happened</b> out of that, but we were also really tired. It was difficult to tour and play these shows that were two or three hours long and then force ourselves to produce something in a studio." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{positive}} {{response to the}} opening sequence by Banksy, creator Matt Groening and Jean came to Kricfalusi {{and asked him if}} he could do something similar. Originally, they only wanted him to do the storyboards and then let their regular crew animate it, but Kricfalusi insisted on doing the animation himself, explaining that [...] "If we had done it that way, no one would even have known that I {{had anything to do with}} it because it would have ended up on model and all pose to pose". [...] On The Simpsons, the animators draw key poses and then let tweeners interpolate between those poses. The interpolation however, is a straight a to b animation. That way the animation ends up having the characters just going from pose to pose. Kricfalusi explains that on The Simpsons he [...] "wanted to try moving the characters in crazy fun ways, not just looking funny each time they come to a stop", and further elaborated [...] "that the way <b>things</b> <b>happened</b> was even more important than what was happening in my work.

500|$|In January 2010, Montag {{revealed}} to People {{that she had}} undergone ten cosmetic surgery procedures {{in a single day}} two months prior, performed by Frank Ryan. Among the procedures were brow-lifts, ear-pinnings, a chin reduction, as well as a second rhinoplasty and second breast augmentation. She commented that she almost died from too much Demerol, reducing her heart rate to five beats per minute. Her debut studio album Superficial was digitally released later that month to an overwhelmingly negative critical response from critics. The self-funded record cost nearly $2 million and sold approximately 1,000 copies in first-week downloads, failing to earn back the money spent making it. In May, she and Pratt made their final appearance on The Hills halfway through the sixth and final season. In December 2013, Montag stated that she and Conrad have [...] "talked a few times" [...] since the series' conclusion, elaborating that [...] "it's unfortunate <b>things</b> <b>happened</b> the way that it did, but we're both different people now, older and more mature." [...] However, in 2015, Montag angrily excoriated Conrad when she appeared on Marriage Boot Camp, during a sequence where the contestants were asked to forgive someone who had hurt them in the past; Montag told a stand-in for Conrad that Conrad had [...] "ruined my life with her lies", said that Conrad DID have a sex tape and had falsely blamed it on her, and that she [...] "forgave" [...] Conrad for being terrible and trying to ruin her life. Montag was universally lambasted for bringing up the sex tape lies anew, parroting the views of Pratt (who Conrad actually blamed for spreading the false rumors; Conrad felt Montag knew he was lying but took Pratt's side because she loved him) and trying to use Conrad's name to get publicity for herself.|$|E
