50|$|Typically, the set {{occurs at}} one trick {{more than is}} {{actually}} necessary to break the bidding team’s contract.

5|$|In 1080°s two trick modes, trick {{attack and}} contest, players accrue points from {{completed}} tricks. In contest mode, players perform tricks and snowboard past flags for points.
