5|$|Governor Horatio Seymour {{arrived on}} Tuesday and spoke at City Hall, where he {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>assuage</b> the crowd by proclaiming that the Conscription Act was unconstitutional. General John E. Wool, {{commander of the}} Eastern District, brought approximately 800 soldiers and Marines in from forts in New York Harbor, West Point, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard. He ordered the militias to return to New York.|$|E
5|$|The Bill of Rights was {{originally}} proposed <b>to</b> <b>assuage</b> Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification. Initially, the First Amendment {{applied only to}} laws enacted by the Congress, {{and many of its}} provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today. Beginning with Gitlow v. New York (1925), the Supreme Court applied the First Amendment to states—a process known as incorporation—through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E

40|$|Turnbull and Solms (2007, this issue) {{say that}} their review should not be {{construed}} as arguing that “Freud was right”. However, they argue for a restoration of Freudian psychology to the scientific pantheon because {{it turns out that}} a number of his specific hypotheses about the global architecture of the mind have a fruitful application to intriguing results in modern neuropsychology. We would argue that it is useful in this context to separate two quite different aspects of Freudian theory. The first is the framework that Freudian theory provides for integrating motivation and emotion into otherwise desiccated cognitive theories. In this sense we can agree that modern neuropsychology will benefit from a reconsideration of Freud. But the second is the specific content of Freudian theory. There seems {{no reason to believe that}} this is any more acceptable to scientific psychology today than it was fifty years ago and for Freud this would represent a failure that the former success could not come close <b>to</b> <b>assuaging...</b>|$|R
5|$|During the season, Robinson pursued {{potential}} major-league interests. The Boston Red Sox held a tryout at Fenway Park for Robinson {{and other}} black players on April 16. The tryout, however, was a farce chiefly designed <b>to</b> <b>assuage</b> the desegregationist sensibilities of powerful Boston City Councilman Isadore Muchnick. Even with the stands limited to management, Robinson {{was subjected to}} racial epithets. Robinson left the tryout humiliated, and more than fourteen years later, in July 1959, the Red Sox became the last major league team to integrate its roster.|$|E
5|$|Nancy was favorably {{impressed}} with Houston's land sales pitch, {{but not so}} {{impressed with}} his interest in her daughter. She {{and others in the}} family were concerned about his reputation as a hard-drinking carouser with a proclivity for profanity, who was 26 years older than Margaret and twice married. Several weeks of love letters had been exchanged between Margaret and Houston by the time he proposed marriage that summer of 1839, presenting her with his image carved on a brooch. In an effort <b>to</b> <b>assuage</b> the family's opposition to the union, Houston spent several weeks in the Lea home in Alabama.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{marks the}} first {{appearance}} of Davros since the 1988 serial Remembrance of the Daleks; he is portrayed by Julian Bleach. It is also the first Doctor Who appearance of Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper; Gareth David-Lloyd as Ianto Jones; Tommy Knight as Luke Smith; and Alexander Armstrong {{as the voice of}} Mr Smith. Adjoa Andoh and Penelope Wilton reprise supporting roles as Martha's mother Francine Jones and former Prime Minister Harriet Jones respectively. Paul O'Grady and Richard Dawkins make cameo appearances as themselves as television personalities who attempt <b>to</b> <b>assuage</b> public fear.|$|E
30|$|It {{is worth}} {{pointing}} out that the generation-skipping household in rural areas and some of the elderly-only households (i.e., only parents are left behind) are forced residence arrangements that may be temporary. As the new model of urbanization pushes forward, the rural-urban development become more balanced, and the policy of residence registration undergoes reform, the problems that come with the generation-skipping household are likely <b>to</b> be <b>assuaged.</b>|$|R
40|$|I {{write this}} {{response}} to Australia&# 039;s Ambivalence towards Asia {{at a time}} when the aftermath of the Boxing Day tsunami has highlighted our regional positioning and obligations with a vengeance. An earlier draft of this item opened with 2004 as the year when the Coalition government, led by John Howard, returned for a third term. One of the first trips to Asia undertaken by the newly &# 039;mandated&# 039; Prime Minister was to attend the inauguration of the new Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. While there, Howard was reported to be discussing further national security and anti-terrorism measures. It seemed that Australia&# 039;s frame of reference when it came to engaging with &# 039;Asia&# 039; reverted firmly <b>to</b> <b>assuaging</b> its traditional anxieties about moral and geographical vulnerability. From its response to date, however, the Australian government has made clear its commitment to helping rehabilitate tsunami-affected communities, particularly in Indonesia. It will be interesting to track how this event and its consequences may affect future Asia/Australia relations in the region...|$|R
40|$|In {{publishing}} the latest National Security Strategy (NSS) and Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) in November 2015 the government managed to deliver quite a feat. The usual defence ‘commentariat’ was largely silenced as their worst fears appeared <b>to</b> be <b>assuaged.</b> Instead of cuts that many had first feared, this review promised {{a whole series}} of improvements. However, as Andrew M Dorman points out, these promises rest on a number of flawed assumptions, which continue to dog defence policy in the UK...|$|R
5|$|Upon his ascension, Playford {{headed a}} {{minority}} government; the LCL only held 15 of the 39 {{seats in the}} lower house. The balance of power was held by 13 mostly conservative independents. Many had gained from discontent over Butler's relatively liberal social stances, so Playford sought <b>to</b> <b>assuage</b> them by having his LCL colleagues refrain from upsetting social conservatives. He also used the threat of an early election to deter the independents from stalling his initiatives—with their lack of party infrastructure and funding, {{they would be the}} most vulnerable to election campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Following {{months of}} Euromaidan street protests that began {{because of his}} refusal to sign an Association Agreement with the European Union in favor of deals from Russia, President Yanukovych fled Kiev in February 2014, {{ultimately}} to Russia, and parliament voted to remove him from his post. This brought another change in direction of Ukraine's association with Europe and by extension NATO. In 2014, pro-Russian unrest occurred in eastern Ukraine and Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation in March. As {{part of an effort}} <b>to</b> <b>assuage</b> concerned groups, newly installed Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk addressed the topic in a Russian language speech on 18 March 2014, emphasizing that Ukraine was not seeking NATO membership. US President Barack Obama echoed this position the following week, while calling for greater NATO presence in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Ifriqiyans of Mazara, {{together}} {{with some of}} the Andalusians, had advanced across the island and laid siege to Palermo. The city held out for a year until September 831, when its commander, the spatharios Symeon, surrendered it in exchange for safe departure for the city's senior officials and possibly the garrison as well. The city suffered greatly during the siege; the Arab historian Ibn al-Athir, records with exaggeration that the city's population fell from 70,000 to 3,000, who were taken as slaves. The city's bishop, Luke, managed to escape and reach Constantinople, where he informed Emperor Theophilos of the disaster. The fall of Palermo marks a decisive step in the Muslim conquest of Sicily: the Muslims gained not only an important military base, but possession of the city—henceforth known simply as al-Madina ("the City")—allowed them to consolidate their control over the western portion of the island, which was established as a regular Aghlabid province. Thus, in March 832, the first Aghlabid governor (wali), Abu Fihr Muhammad ibn Abdallah, arrived in Palermo. Abu Fihr was a capable man, and was able <b>to</b> <b>assuage</b> the often violent dissensions between Ifriqiyans and Andalusians.|$|E
50|$|During the hospital's inauguration, {{treatment}} for cancer was mostly palliative. The hospital offered what {{was considered the}} best treatments available for that time. Cancer treatment then meant, at best, easing pain and making the sufferer as comfortable as possible. Many patients came to the New York Cancer Hospital, in effect, <b>to</b> die, <b>assuaged</b> by morphine. Other forms of relief included carriage rides in Central Park and Sunday services in the hospital's Chapel of St. Elizabeth of Hungary, patron saint of the suffering.|$|R

5|$|ReCore {{was first}} {{revealed}} at E3 2015 during Microsoft's opening press conference. At {{the conclusion of}} the debut trailer, Microsoft revealed the game was to be released {{in the second quarter of}} 2016 on the Xbox One. On January 4, 2016, Microsoft announced that ReCore would also be released for Microsoft Windows. ReCore was released as the first title of Xbox's Play Anywhere program – the opportunity to play the game on both Microsoft Windows and Xbox One, no matter the platform for which it was initially purchased – on September 13, 2016, in North America and Australia, September 15 in Japan and September 16 in Europe. After the loading screens were criticized, a patch was made <b>to</b> <b>assuage</b> their long duration on the Xbox One. An artbook, The Art of ReCore, was published on September 27, 2016, by Dark Horse Comics. A free trial version lasting 30 minutes was released the following month in concurrence with an update launched to polish the audio, performance, waypoints, achievement tracking, collision locations, checkpoints and respawn points. ReCore: Definitive Edition was released on August 29, 2017. The definitive edition adds new story content, new areas to explore, and quality-of-life gameplay changes and fixes.|$|E
5|$|The {{chambers}} {{appointed a}} conference committee to resolve {{differences between the}} House and Senate versions of the bill. A major contention concerned the poll tax provisions; the Senate version allowed the Attorney General to sue states that used poll taxes to discriminate, while the House version outright banned all poll taxes. Initially, the committee members were stalemated. To help broker a compromise, Attorney General Katzenbach drafted legislative language explicitly asserting that poll taxes were unconstitutional and instructed the Department of Justice to sue the states that maintained poll taxes. <b>To</b> <b>assuage</b> concerns of liberal committee members that this provision was not strong enough, Katzenbach {{enlisted the help of}} Martin Luther King, Jr., who gave his support to the compromise. King's endorsement ended the stalemate, and on July 29, the conference committee reported its version out of committee. The House approved this conference report version of the bill on August 3 by a 328-74 vote (Democrats 217-54, Republicans 111-20), and the Senate passed it on August 4 by a 79-18 vote (Democrats 49-17, Republicans 30-1). On August 6, President Johnson signed the Act into law with King, Rosa Parks, John Lewis, and other civil rights leaders in attendance at the signing ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The {{views of}} Whitehall were not echoed by the naval commanders, {{especially}} Sir Varyl Begg, Commander-in-Chief of British {{forces in the}} region, who believed that the carrier {{was too weak to}} defend herself against Indonesian attack or strike in turn against them. Begg adjudged that the narrowness of the Strait combined with local geographical features restricted the ships' movement and negated their radar, while custom prevented the carrier from flying its aircraft or even carrying them on deck, rendering it and the escorts extremely vulnerable in case of attack. He offered instead to send the destroyers, which were far more expendable pieces than a fleet carrier. His views were supported by the High Commissioner to Malaysia, Lord Antony Head, who argued that there would be very little gain for Indonesia and loss for Britain if the carrier was not risked. Luce, however, remained adamant that the Victorious must sail through herself, but in order <b>to</b> <b>assuage</b> Begg's fears assured him that the more modern carrier HMS Centaur would be on hand to provide air cover for the task force. Reinforcements were also rushed to Singapore to meet any Indonesian provocation. Thorneycroft ordered Begg to begin planning for the forced passage of the Strait, as officials determined on 3–4 September that the carrier must not be diverted.|$|E

50|$|Because {{of the low}} {{accuracy}} of conventional screening tests, 5-10% of women, often those who are older, will opt for an invasive test even if they received a low-risk score from the screening. A patient who received a 1:330 risk score, while technically low-risk (since the cutoff for high-risk is commonly quoted as 1:270), might {{be more likely to}} still opt for a confirmatory invasive test. On the other hand, a patient who receives a 1:1000 risk score is more likely <b>to</b> feel <b>assuaged</b> that her pregnancy is normal.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{itself was}} made as {{cost-effective}} as possible <b>to</b> further <b>assuage</b> {{the concerns of}} lenders in a difficult economy, using the CM at-risk model. Most parts were prefabricated. The building's windows were produced in China, then set in the facade panels by a company in Calverton, on Long Island, and then shipped to the site on flatbed trucks. According to Della Valle, one had merely 1 inches (1.5 in) of overhead clearance when it crossed the Manhattan Bridge, leading the fabricators to say they would never build such large panels again. They were fully applied in two weeks.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the 1990s, Cabindan rebels {{kidnapped and}} ransomed off foreign oil workers to in turn finance further {{attacks against the}} {{national}} government. FLEC militants stopped buses, forcing Chevron Oil workers out, and setting fire to the buses on 27 March and 23 April 1992. A large-scale battle took place between FLEC and police in Malongo on 14 May in which 25 mortar rounds accidentally hit a nearby Chevron compound. The government, fearing {{the loss of their}} prime source of revenue, began to negotiate with representatives from Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda-Renewal (FLEC-R), Armed Forces of Cabinda (FLEC-FAC), and the Democratic Front of Cabinda (FDC) in 1995. Patronage and bribery failed <b>to</b> <b>assuage</b> the anger of FLEC-R and FLEC-FAC and negotiations ended. In February 1997, FLEC-FAC kidnapped two Inwangsa SDN-timber company employees, killing one and releasing the other after receiving a $400,000 ransom. FLEC-FLAC kidnapped eleven people in April 1998, nine Angolans and two Portuguese, released for a $500,000 ransom. FLEC-R kidnapped five Byansol-oil engineering employees, two Frenchman, two Portuguese, and an Angolan, in March 1999. While militants released the Angolan, the government complicated the situation by promising the rebel leadership $12.5million for the hostages. When António Bento Bembe, the President of FLEC-R, showed up, the Angolan army arrested him and his bodyguards. The Angolan army later forcibly freed the other hostages on 7 July. By {{the end of the year}} the government had arrested the leadership of all three rebel organizations.|$|E
5|$|Although the Russians {{were quick}} {{to come to the}} aid of the British, the Anglo-Russian {{relationship}} was fraught with an underlying sense of distrust rooted in a long-standing history of competition. Just decades before the mutiny of 1915, Russia and Britain were already locked in imperialist rivalry. Spurred by the last tsar's Asiatic Mission and his visit to South East Asia as part of his world tour of 1891, the Russian government appointed its first ethnic-Russian Consul, V. Vyvodtsev, to Singapore as early as 1890. The Russian presence in Southeast Asia during the last quarter of the 19th century was meant not only to safeguard its economic and strategic position in China but also to carefully observe the designs and advances of its imperialist rivals in the region, foremost among them being the British empire. Anglo-Russian relationship took a turn for the worst during the latter half of the 19th century when both Britain and Russia were locked in competition for Afghanistan and Persia as well as when Britain halted Russian advancement into the Balkans and Turkey. Britain’s alignment with Japan as ally worsened Anglo-Russian relationship with the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05. This history of suspicion and rivalry explains why Rospopov sent a secret telegram on 21 February expressing his reservations at placing the Orel and its accompanying men and guns under the command of the British military in Singapore. Eventually the French admiral was able <b>to</b> <b>assuage</b> the fears of Rospopov and assured him that Russian aid at this point would serve as a good means to strengthen Anglo-Russian relation. When the mutiny was finally quelled, the Russian captain Vinokurov reportedly remarked to the British Governor to Singapore that the Russian assistance in suppressing the mutiny ‘’would unite the two countries better than any treaty’’.|$|E

60|$|These feuds {{were taken}} up by the Managing Committee, who interceded for the {{penitent}} offenders on the following morning, and obtained their re-establishment in Lady Penelope's good graces, upon moderate terms.

We must, therefore, give a brief sketch of that potential Committee, which both factions, acting as if on a self-denying ordinance, had combined to invest with the reins of government.|$|R
40|$|The {{assassination}} of Israeli premier Yitzhak Rabin provided {{the most vivid}} demonstration to date of religious-nationalist opposition inside Israel {{to the principle of}} exchanging land for peace. This article sets out to explore this world view and its intellectual origins, exploring in the process how the use of sacred Judaic texts have become both the monopoly of religious-nationalism and the template for politically inspired violence against those in Israel suspected of condoning territorial compromise. This article concludes that if the ideotheology of religious-nationalists is <b>to</b> be <b>assuaged,</b> a religious discourse supporting territorial retrenchment has {{to become part of the}} political fabric of the centre-left in Israel...|$|R
