Her conductor tapped lightly on <b>the</b> <b>doorframe,</b> and presently the wet curtain was moved aside by Constance, who greeted her visitor with a glad smile while giving him her hand, but the darkness of the small landing, which had no light from above, prevented her from seeing Fan for some moments.|$|E
50|$|Eight days later, {{following}} these two extensive searches by {{a total of}} 26 trained detectives, the pen was found on <b>the</b> <b>doorframe</b> in Ishikawa’s kitchen. Both court decisions, that of the Tokyo High Court and the Supreme Court, state that the first 26 detectives had simply overlooked <b>the</b> <b>doorframe,</b> but their reasons for why this happened differ. The Tokyo High Court said that it was because the location was too obvious, while the Supreme Court maintained that short people would have difficulty seeing the top of <b>the</b> <b>doorframe.</b> <b>The</b> <b>doorframe</b> is approximately 1.83 meters (6 feet) tall; there is a picture of the kitchen taken immediately following the second search that shows a small stepladder in front of the door.|$|E

50|$|The Series 9 to Series 11 {{locomotives}} were visually {{indistinguishable from}} each other, {{but could be}} distinguished from all earlier models by the rainwater drainage holes on their lower sides. These holes were usually covered by so-called buckets, but the covers were absent on a few locomotives. Another distinction was the end doors, which were recessed into <b>the</b> <b>doorframes</b> on Series 9 to Series 11 locomotives, compared to earlier models which had their end doors flush with <b>the</b> <b>doorframes.</b> In addition, on Series 9 and later, the split side window on the driver's assistant side {{was replaced by a}} single rectangular side window with rounded corners. Finally, unlike all earlier models, all four doors on Series 9 to Series 11 locomotives had rounded corners.|$|R

50|$|In Ybor City, bread (like milk) {{used to be}} {{delivered}} every morning. Houses had a sturdy nail driven into <b>the</b> <b>doorframe</b> {{next to the door}} on which deliveryman would impale the fresh loaf of bread. La Joven closed in 1973 and was renovated and converted shortly after into a main part of the museum complex at the Ybor City State Museum. The original ovens where the original Cuban bread was baked are still viewable inside.|$|E
50|$|A door bar is a newer device {{intended}} to replace door chains. It {{consists of a}} U shaped bar that attaches to a hinge on <b>the</b> <b>doorframe,</b> and a knob on the door. The bar swings over the knob to restrict the full opening of the door. Door bars are easier to use, and can be made of much sturdier material than door chains. Also, door bars cannot be defeated {{in the same way}} that door chains can be, although they can be defeated just as easily in different ways.|$|E
50|$|The Billeshwara temple {{is in the}} Hoysala style. This temple has elaborately carved jambs on <b>the</b> <b>doorframe</b> of the garbhagudi. At {{the bottom}} of each side, there are five carved figures. Manmatha is in the central projection. Rati is at his side. Daksha (the goat headed deity) is also present and all are flanked by attendants. The temple has a {{sanctuary}} face which is incomplete. The temple outer walls are decorated with designs of temple towers and carved diamond shaped depressions. The square panels show carved serpents with intertwined tails, animals, musicians, and foliage.|$|E
25|$|In September 2003, an {{expedition}} led by Carl Spencer dived into the wreck. This {{was the first}} expedition to dive Britannic where all the bottom divers were using closed circuit rebreathers (CCR). Diver Rich Stevenson found that several watertight doors were open. It {{has been suggested that}} this was because the mine strike coincided with the change of watches. Alternatively, the explosion may have distorted <b>the</b> <b>doorframes.</b> A number of mine anchors were located off the wreck by sonar expert Bill Smith, confirming the German records of U-73 that Britannic was sunk by a single mine and the damage was compounded by open portholes and watertight doors. Spencer's expedition was broadcast extensively across the world for many years by National Geographic and the UK's Channel 5.|$|R
50|$|The {{residence}} {{is of the}} Jacobean Revival style, with a few modern elements blending {{into the}} original scheme.

The gable roof is of sturdy pitched slate with several large brick chimneys protruding from the house. The second floor also contains several bay windows.|$|R
5|$|On {{the left}} side of the altar are also two retablos. The larger altar, which is a twin of the altar {{opposite}} it, houses an image of a unidentified saint on the topmost level, presumably Michael the Archangel, and the crucified Christ (originally Madonna and Child) in the center, Saint Anthony of Padua on the middle-left, and Saint Nicholas of Tolentino on the middle-right niches. The original images on the lowest level have been replaced. The smaller retablo, also of the same style, houses the images of Saint Joseph with the child Jesus, and St Isidore the Laborer on the lower and upper level, respectively. In the sacristy is another retablo, with a crucifix in its central niche. On <b>the</b> <b>doorframes</b> of <b>the</b> sacristy are two bas-reliefs depicting Saint Ignatius and the first Jesuits before Mary and the child Jesus and of St. Ignatius holding a book (in stucco).|$|R
5000|$|Chinese couplets or [...] "contrapuntal couplets" [...] {{may be seen}} on doorways in Chinese {{communities}} worldwide. Couplets displayed {{as part of the}} Chinese New Year festival, on {{the first}} morning of the New Year, are called chunlian. These are usually purchased at a market a few days before and glued to <b>the</b> <b>doorframe.</b> The text of the couplets is often traditional and contains hopes for prosperity. Other chunlian reflect more recent concerns. For example, the CCTV New Year's Gala usually promotes couplets reflecting current political themes in mainland China.|$|E
50|$|A veteran {{police detective}} has testified {{that it is}} unthinkable that trained police {{investigators}} would have overlooked a bright pink pen on a relatively low doorframe, and even more unthinkable that such a thing could happen twice. The investigators called to search Ishikawa’s house were the top professionals from the area. By the time Ishikawa was arrested, the case had already become a scandal, and the police were doing {{whatever it took to}} find the culprit. They spared no cost or personnel in conducting as thorough a search as possible. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>doorframe</b> is mentioned in all standard police detective textbooks as a routine location to search.|$|E

On February 11, 1963, while Nicholas, age one, and his sister Frieda, two and a half, slept upstairs, Plath taped shut <b>the</b> <b>doorframe</b> of the room in which the children slept, then placed towels around the kitchen door to make sure fumes could not escape to harm the children, and committed suicide using the toxic gas from the kitchen oven.|$|E

5000|$|In 2005, Neely painted {{his first}} [...] "Guardian" [...] {{painting}}, a small angel image on found wood, for his mother. The painting {{was created in}} memory of his brother Erik Hudson Neely who died in 2000 from an epileptic seizure. His mother, Clare L. Neely wanted the piece to hang between <b>the</b> <b>doorframe</b> and the light switch in Erik's childhood bedroom. Neely gave his mother a few more of these angel paintings on found wood for her to give to friends. Neely began selling them after a request for 50 from a Spartanburg business owner who wanted to give them as a Christmas gift to his employees. Neely's Guardians have been sold nationally and internationally, but primarily in the Southern United States.|$|E
50|$|The gandi is {{devoid of}} any sculptural embellishment. During the {{renovation}} work red coloured wash {{has been given to}} the temple. The doorjambs are decorated with three vertical bands and the river goddesses are usually found in {{the upper part of the}} door frame on either side of the navagraha slab. The doorjamb measures 1.72 m high x 1.30 m wide. Ganga is found on the right side of <b>the</b> <b>doorframe</b> and Yamuna in the left. They stand over their respective vehicles with their outside hand on the thigh and the uplifted inside hand holding a vase as in the examples in the Muktesvara compound. Their hair is stylistically depicted and their faces are illuminated by an identical soft and warm smile. Both are associated with dwarf-attendants. At the base of the doorjamb Saivite dvarapala are found on either side, whose upper parts only are visible.|$|E
50|$|Example: “Composition Blue and White” and “Composition Green and White”1998, are {{inflatable}} works about painting. Merrick installed mammoth dinosaur shapes, {{into the}} exhibition space, in this instance, takes {{aim at the}} viewer, the viewer can’t back {{up to see the}} image. <b>The</b> <b>doorframe</b> and the oversized color inside, then block the entrance to the exhibition. The dinosaurs made from huge colored containers signify the painting as a sack or the brush stroke, (or just air: nothing.) The white gallery is the canvas or perhaps the modern cave. These works overtake the social space and the area of contemplation. The work is better seen bit by bit, only the bright color of the material and the white of the gallery walls are visible, making the work about color and scale and doubt. The dinosaur image can be seen as an institutional critique where the walls of power and history close the artist in, making the artist domesticated, alien and impotent and eventually obsolete and extinct.|$|E
