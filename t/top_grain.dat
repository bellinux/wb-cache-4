Objective: To examine food groups consumed and Healthy Eating Index (HEI- 2010) scores for US adults meeting the fiber adequate intake (AI) based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data 2001 – 2010. Design: A secondary analysis of NHANES data from 2001 to 2010. Participants included adults aged 19 and older (n= 24, 807) with complete day 1 dietary records. Variables measured were food group sources of fiber and HEI- 2010 scores. Sample-weighted data were used to calculate least square means (LSM) ±standard error of the mean (SEM) by fiber intake quartile along with HEI- 2010 scores. Significance was set at P< 0. 05.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Field {{trials were}} {{conducted}} in metal wheat storage bins to determine whether pressure aeration, pushing ambient air from the bottom, or suction aeration, pulling air down from the top, would be more efficient at cooling the wheat mass and thereby limiting insect population growth. Aeration was accomplished at an approximate airflow rate of 0. 22 to 0. 31 m 3 /min/t and was done by adjusting thermostatic controllers to operate the aeration fans when ambient temperatures fell below specified thresholds. Summer and autumn cooling cycles using suction aeration cooled the warmest part of the bin, the <b>top</b> of the <b>grain</b> mass first, which resulted in lower overall wheat mass temperatures compared to pressure aeration, where the <b>top</b> of the <b>grain</b> mass always remained warmer than with suction aeration.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} {{dynamics of}} kernel components for spikelets at different positions within a rice panicle were investigated during grain filling {{to understand the}} physiological reasons for the variation of grain quality. Two rice cultivars, Yangdao 6 (indica) and Yangjing 9538 (japonica), were field-grown, and the grain filling characters and contents of starch, soluble sugar, and protein of the spikelets at different positions were studied. There were significant differences in matter accumulation among spikelets at different positions during grain filling. The early-flowering spikelets presented dominance over the late-flowering spikelets in initial time and initial rate of accumulation. At the initial and mid filling stages, the contents and the rates of starch and amylose accumulation in spikelets decreased with the flowering sequence, but soluble sugar content (SSC) exhibited the opposite trend. The difference in SSC among the spikelets of Yangjing 9538 was {{greater than that of}} Yangdao 6, but amylose content in mature spikelets showed no obvious relationship to their flowering sequence. The crude protein content (CPC) of early-flowering spikelets decreased more rapidly than that of late-flowering ones at the initial filling stage, and CPC in the spikelets on the secondary branch was higher than that on the primary branch, but CPC in early-flowering ones was lower than that in late-flowering across the whole grain filling period. Grain water content (GWC) of early-flowering spikelets decreased more rapidly than that of late-flowering spikelets on the same branch at the initial and mid filling stages, especially for the <b>top</b> <b>grain</b> on each primary branch. The results suggested that poor grain filling of late-flowering spikelets may be attributed to their low biological activity rather than carbohydrate supply limitation...|$|E

As a consequence, {{there is a growing}} demand for varieties adapted to organic and/or low input farming. The objectives of the present study were to (i) compare the testcross performance of segregating maize (Zea mays) populations under established organic (OF) and conventional farming (CF) systems, (ii) determine quantitative genetic parameters decisive for the selection response under OF vs CF conditions, and (iii) draw conclusions for breeding new varieties optimally adapted to OF. Testcross performance of four different material groups of preselected lines (90 lines per group) derived from early European breeding material was assessed under OF and CF in three different geographic regions in Germany in 2008. Grain yields under OF were 3 to 18 % lower than under CF in the individual experiments depending on the test region and, to a lesser extent, on the genetic material. On average, grain dry matter yield under OF was 1077 g m- 2 compared to 1186 g m- 2 under CF. Phenotypic correlations between OF and CF were small or moderate for grain yield {{in each of the four}} material groups (0. 22 to 0. 45), while strong and highly significant correlations were found for dry matter content (0. 89 to 0. 94). Genotypes with <b>top</b> <b>grain</b> yields under OF often did not show this superiority under CF and vice versa.

However, fumigating in {{unsealed}} structures {{is the leading cause}} of control failures and subsequent development of insect resistance. Sealing the storage structure is the only practical way to ensure a complete kill of all insects at all life stages. The cost, effort, and feasibility of sealing a U. S. corrugated steel silo during construction was evaluated and compared against an Australian sealed silo designed for fumigation. Gas monitoring and thermosiphon recirculation equipment was installed on both silos. Fumigation efficacy was evaluated using pressure half-life decay times, fumigant concentrations, insect bioassays, and grain quality data. Three fumigations with phosphine (PH₃) pellets or tablets and two with VAPORPH₃OS® cylinderized PH₃ and ProFume® cylinderized sulfuryl fluoride (SF) were performed in each silo for a total of ten experimental treatments. The Australian silo required 266 man-hours to construct and cost $ 180 for additional sealing, compared to 359 man-hours and $ 3, 284 for constructing and sealing the U. S. silo. The Australian silo had a maximum pressure half-life decay time of 163 s versus 50 s for the U. S. silo. At application rates of 1. 5 g/mᶟ of PH₃ both silos maintained an average concentration of approximately 0. 28 g/mᶟ for 14 days. With thermosiphon recirculation the average minimum-to-maximum PH₃ concentration ratio in the U. S. silo was 0. 52, compared to a ratio of 0. 17 when fumigating without thermosiphon recirculation. Greater than 99 % adult mortality was observed in all insect bioassays which included PH₃ resistant strains of R. dominica and T. castaneum. The average emergence from fumigated bioassays was 7 adult insects, compared to an average of 383 adults for the non-fumigated controls. Grain stored for 10 months in the sealed silos increased from approximately 11. 5 % to 17 % m. c. in the top 0. 3 m of grain, and decreased in test weight from approximately 77 to 65 kg/hL. Although the Australian silo retained higher fumigant concentrations than the U. S. silo, fumigations were successful in both.

Our results on barriers with a range of degrees of oxidation have enabled a mechanism for the oxidation to be proposed.
