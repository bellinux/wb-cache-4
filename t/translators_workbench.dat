40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} the basic concepts behind data analysis and data modelling and relate these to terminological data, illustrating {{the implications of}} these concepts for both the terminology builder and user. We will also describe our experience of using these concepts and techniques in projects including <b>Translators</b> <b>Workbench,</b> MULTILEX and TRANSTERM. The aim of this paper is, in effect, to elaborate the database terms "entities", "relationships", "attributes", "normal form", "data integrity", "data redundancy", "referential integrity" amongst others. We will describe how the most common techniques, such as entity-relationship modelling, {{can be applied to the}} very complex data structures that the terminology of today requires, and how this may be extended for future needs, such as object-oriented and knowledge-based term banks. Introduction Terminology management has progressed hand-in-hand with the establishment of terminology as a discipline being used in daily practice by [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{project will}} create an {{integrated}} suite of open-source tools for translators of Buddhist texts, the Buddhist <b>Translators</b> <b>Workbench</b> (BTW). BTW will gather data on source texts and translations across cultures and across time. It will support both real-time and offline collaboration on group translation projects by logging user threads and dialogs and creating “digital footnotes” that preserve and inspire new research. BTW will {{for the first}} time ground Buddhist translation work in a shared, easily accessible body of knowledge. At Level I the project will bring together scholars and IT experts to choose an initial set of 500 - 1, 000 terms and design an alpha-level prototype, using selected Abhidharma texts as its initial resource. It will also address software-development needs, including creation of language agnostic searches, proximity searches, and computer recognition of word clusters (Tibetan) and individual words (Sanskrit) ...|$|E
40|$|The Buddhist <b>Translators</b> <b>Workbench</b> (BTW) {{offers an}} {{interactive}} digital environment for scholars and translators of classical Buddhist texts. Focused on lexicographic research, it gives {{ready access to}} the resources needed to research key terms in context and suggests new lines of inquiry. Scholars can record their findings for broad dissemination, {{and the ability to}} log user threads and dialogs will support collaboration and encourage user contributions. Extensive interactive annotations of key terms will preserve the work of earlier generations and create new possibilities for interdisciplinary work. By establishing a shared body of knowledge easily accessible across specialized disciplines, BTW will {{serve as a model for}} other scholars working in clearly delimited fields. Level I focused on planning, developing alpha-level prototypes for inputting data, and choosing sample terms and texts. Level II will initiate work on a proof-of-concept database to go online in May 2014...|$|E

40|$|In many {{experimental}} studies on assessing post-editing efficiency, idiosyncratic user interfaces isolate translators from transla-tion aids {{that are available}} to them in their daily work. In contrast, our experimen-tal design allows translators to use a well-known <b>translator</b> <b>workbench</b> for both con-ventional translation and post-editing. We find that post-editing reduces translation time significantly, although considerably less than reported in isolated experiments, and argue that overall assessments of post-editing efficiency should be based on a re-alistic translation environment. ...|$|R

40|$|Translation memory systems aim {{to reuse}} {{previously}} translated texts. Because the operational {{unit of the}} first-generation translation memory systems is the sentence, such systems are only useful text types in which full-sentence repetition frequently occurs. Second-generation sub-sentential translation memory systems try to remedy this problem by providing additional translation suggestions for sub-sentential chunks. In this paper, we compare {{the performance of a}} sentence-based translation memory system (SDL Trados <b>Translator's</b> <b>Workbench)</b> with a sub-sentential translation memory system (Similis) on different text types. We demonstrate that some text types (in this case, journalistic texts) are not suited to be translated by means of a translation memory system. We show that Similis offers useful additional translation suggestions for terminology and frequent multiword expressions...|$|R
40|$|Although undeniably {{useful for}} the {{translation}} of certain types of repetitive document, current translation memory technology {{is limited by the}} rudimentary techniques employed for approximate matching. Such systems, moreover, incorporate no real notion of a document, since the databases that underlie them are essentially composed of isolated sentence strings. As a result, current TM products can only exploit {{a small portion of the}} knowledge residing in translators' past production. This paper examines some of the changes that will have to be implemented if the technology is to be made more widely applicable. 1 Introduction The term "translation memory" admits of at least two different definitions, one broad and one narrow. The narrower, but more widely used, definition corresponds to the characteristics of a popular set of commercial products that includes <b>Translator's</b> <b>Workbench</b> from Trados, Transit from Star AG, D'ej`aVu from Atril and IBM's TranslationManager/ 2.

This article focuses on presenting the results of a survey carried out with Brazilian translators to examine the usage patterns of only one of these tools: translation memory systems, which were developed to ensure productivity gains, more consistency and cost savings. This survey was conducted via a questionnaire sent by email, 122 Adriana Ceschin Rieche using as background the international survey undertaken by the Localization Industry Standards Association (LISA), the international organization for the localization industry, segment in which such systems are used the most. The questionnaire was developed to try to answer the questions raised with the use of two of these translation memory systems in my work as a professional <b>translator</b> (Trados <b>Translator’s</b> <b>Workbench</b> and Wordfast) and the perception that, together with the advantages promoted by the manufacturers, such systems can also bring some problems during translation...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{algorithm}} for the automatic extraction of translation patterns between two (Indo-) European languages. These consist of possibly discontiguous text fragments, with the bilingual {{relationship between the}} text fragments and the discontinuities between them made explicit. The patterns are extracted from a bilingual parallel corpus aligned at the sentence level, {{without the need for}} linguistic analysis, and are used to build a translation memory database which is intended for use in a machine aided human translation (MAHT) setting, such as a <b>translator’s</b> <b>workbench</b> (TWB). The patterns extracted could also form the basis for example-based machine translation (EBMT) without the need for complex linguistic or statistical processing. Given a TM database made up of our concept of translation patterns and a SL input string, relevant translation patterns combine to form TL translations as suggestions to the translator. We evaluate the accuracy of the translation patterns extracted along with the quality of translations produced. ...|$|R
40|$|Switzerland is {{perceived}} as a highly multilingual country, with four national languages and a solid translation tradition in official, administrative and corporate settings, now even extended to include English. A research case study was set up to investigate the understanding and use of translation and language technologies by Swiss language service providers. This paper highlights some findings, particularly focusing upon the issue of translation automation processes in multilingual documentation production, with a view not only to spot preconceptions or knowledge gaps about MT, but also to suggest some training principles. We will argue that training activities ought to present MT systems as key aiding components of <b>translator</b> <b>workbenches</b> and, their output, as a valid linguistic resource for further human refining, if necessary. Moreover, in line with the idea that MT can be part and parcel of multilingual content production cycles, we will look at the interaction of MT with controlled language, CAT tools and terminology work. In sum, we will make explicit the usefulness of MT against the widespread prejudice that investing in MT does not return any benefits given the ‘low and hilarious quality of its output’, as quoted by most of the interviewees of our case study...|$|R

40|$|In Lithuania and {{throughout}} the whole world, machine translation study field {{becomes more and more}} popular each day. That’s why there’s a need to create language translation tools. With the growing distance learning infrastructure, it is useful to implement it by computer means (using virtual learning environment). The purpose of this thesis: using virtual learning environment (VLE) Moodle to create a distance course (supplemented with Moodle and ©SDL interface) that educates theoretical and practical language translation skills. The study carried out in machine translation (MT) systems and technologies analysis to determine their practical application needs and opportunities. According to a survey of professional translators, ©SDL language translation tools are currently the most popular in Lithuania, so its’ use needs to be supported and encouraged. During research, ©SDL language translation tools (MultiTerm 2009 and <b>Translator’s</b> <b>Workbench)</b> were brought to interface with a virtual learning environment (VLE) Moodle. This interface was created using JavaScript and HTML technologies. Using integrated functional Moodle tools, illustrative (compendiums, self-tests, etc.) and active learning (laboratory work, practical knowledge of assessment tools, etc.) objects were created. Based on a computerized learning tools’ testing results, MT course can be used in both conventional and distance education self-studies. The main advantage of this course is that students have no restrictions (location, time, age, etc.) to develop language skills and absorb the knowledge of modern informational translation technologies. Moodle VLE and ©SDL interface, as an analog, can be used to design Moodle and any computer systems’ interfaces...|$|R
