500|$|Early {{versions}} {{opened with}} the line [...] "Don't {{talk to me about}} the rights of the IRA, UDA." [...] U2's bassist, Adam Clayton, recalls that better judgment led to the removal of such a politically charged line, and that the song's [...] "viewpoint became very humane and non-sectarian...which, is the only responsible position." [...] The chosen opening line, [...] "I can't believe the news today" [...] crystallises the prevailing response, especially among young people, to the violence in Northern Ireland during the 1970s and 1980s. In successive stanzas, the lyrics paraphrase religious text from Matthew [...] ("mother's children; brothers, sisters torn apart") and bring a twist to 1 Corinthians [...] ("we eat and drink while tomorrow they die", instead of [...] "let us eat and drink; for <b>tomorrow</b> <b>we</b> die"). [...] The song finishes with a call for the Irish to stop fighting each other, and [...] "claim the victory Jesus won...on [...] Sunday bloody Sunday." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} with the song's tempo, Azalea's rapping is fast-paced and in Southern American English pronunciation throughout. A timed build-drop production formula is used to vary her delivery in which she puts emphasis on certain lyrics and lifts off on others. During the verses, Azalea's delivery is expletively riddled and contains trill consonants, particularly during the bridge, [...] "All about money, the nice never ending / We party till morning, <b>tomorrow</b> <b>we</b> kick it". According to Digital Spy's Lewis Corner, the chorus causes the listener to [...] "adhere to the song's title". In it, Azalea repeatedly raps, [...] "Make it bounce / Make it bounce / Make it bounce / Shake it, break it, make it bounce". Lyrically, [...] "Bounce" [...] is about being carefree, partying, dancing, and celebrating life. Sam Lansky of Idolator describes the lyrics as [...] "party-happy uncomplicated fun". Several critics compared the song to 2 Unlimited's [...] "No Limit" [...] (1993).|$|E

500|$|Longstreet's actions at the Battle of Gettysburg {{would become}} the {{centerpiece}} of the controversy that surrounded him for over a century. Ahead of his troops he arrived on the battlefield late in the afternoon of the first day, July 1, 1863. By then, two Union corps had been driven by Ewell and Hill back through the town into defensive positions on Cemetery Hill. Lee had not intended to fight before his army was fully concentrated, but chance and questionable decisions by A.P. Hill brought on the battle, which- on the first day- was an impressive Confederate victory. Meeting with Lee, Longstreet was concerned about the strength of the Union defensive position and advocated a strategic movement around the left flank of the enemy, to [...] "secure good ground between him and his capital," [...] which would presumably compel the Union commander, Maj. Gen. George Meade, to attack defensive positions erected by the Confederates. Instead, Lee exclaimed, [...] "If the enemy is there <b>tomorrow,</b> <b>we</b> must attack him." ...|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, Tessa {{demonstrates}} great courage, {{for example}} in [...] "", where she is abducted by three mountain men led by Immortal Caleb Cole, who wants to marry her. Tessa refuses to submit and spreads doubt among them, resulting in Cole finally killing {{one of his own}} men before MacLeod rescues her. Reviewer Rob Lineberger of DVDVerdict.com commented that [...] "...this episode shows the tough stuff Tessa is made of." [...] Tessa is a very selfless character, although it has, occasionally, been known to put her into rather sticky situations, for example, in the episode [...] "See No Evil", Tessa's friend, Natalie, is attacked by serial killer Michael Tanovsky and Tessa uses herself as bait: [...] "Nobody's watching over his next victim, Duncan... and she's going to die if you and I don't stop him." [...] Lineberger commented that [...] ", Tessa gets a taste for how Duncan's life must feel when she faces the killer." [...] She hits Tanovsky with her car, telling MacLeod [...] "I thought ridding the world of evil would feel better than this." [...] Panzer comments that having Tessa stop the killer [...] "...was kind of an unusual idea , and this {{was the subject of a}} lot of meetings with [...] David Abramowitz, myself and the people from the various networks, domestic and foreign, who were involved." [...] Tessa has a reputation for speaking frankly and for refusing to tolerate any nonsense. In [...] "", when MacLeod refuses to take her where an evil Immortal is, she says, [...] "I know why you don't want me there. You're afraid that what happened to Lucas [...] could happen to you." [...] Tessa has no self-pity and [...] "...doesn't like euphemisms". For example, in [...] "For <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>We</b> Die", MacLeod calls her [...] "contrary by nature" [...] Tessa parks her car without regard to interdictions, can drive a speedboat, is a poor chess player and dislikes war.|$|E
500|$|By now, Rogers {{has learned}} Astaire's true {{identity}} although {{neither of them}} yet know that her impulsive marriage to Rhodes is null and void. Dining together during carnival night in Venice, and to help assuage her guilt, Astaire declares: [...] "Let's eat, drink and be merry, for <b>tomorrow</b> <b>we</b> have to face him," [...] which serves as the cue for the music of [...] "The Piccolino", the film's big production number. A gondola parade {{is followed by the}} entry of a dancing chorus who perform a series of ballroom poses and rippling-pattern routines choroeographed by Hermes Pan. Berlin, who lavished a great deal of effort on the song designed it as a pastiche of [...] "The Carioca" [...] from Flying Down to Rio (1933) and [...] "The Continental" [...] from The Gay Divorcee (1934), and the lyric communicates its fake origin: [...] "It was written by a Latin/A gondolier who sat in/his home out in Brooklyn/and gazed at the stars." [...] It is a song about a song and Rogers sings it to Astaire after which an off-camera chorus repeats it while the dance ensemble is photographed, Busby Berkeley-style, from above. The camera then switches to Rogers and Astaire who bound down to the stage to perform a two-minute dance, all shot in one take, with the Astaire-Pan choreography separately referencing the basic melody and the Latin vamp in the accompaniment. They dance to the accompaniment as they descend the steps and glide along the dance floor, then, when the melody enters, they halt and perform the Piccolino step, which involves the feet darting out {{to the side of the}} body. The rest of the dance involves repetitions and variations of the Piccolino step and the hopping steps associated with the vamp, leading to some complex amalgamations of the two. On the vamp melody's final appearance, the dancers perform a highly embellished form of the Piccolino step as they travel sideways back to their table, sinking back into their chairs and lifting their glasses in a toast.|$|E

That day, Raul Colombo, representing Argentina's candidacy, ended his speech with the phrase [...] "We can start the World Cup <b>tomorrow.</b> <b>We</b> have it all."

2500|$|... 1860 and onward, {{the number}} of Armenian schools, philanthropic and {{patriotic}} organizations multiplied in the Ottoman Empire. [...] The initial aim of Protestant missionaries were {{the conversion of the}} Muslims and Jews, but soon they became involved with Protestant reformation of the Orthodox Armenians. The Armenian subjects of the Empire influenced by the Armenian Diaspora, the network of congregations and schools of the Protestant missionaries throughout the Ottoman Empire begin to rethink their position in the world. In 1872, the journalist Grigor Ardzruni from Ottoman Empire said “Yesterday we were an ecclesiastical community, today we are patriots, <b>tomorrow</b> <b>we</b> will be a nation of workers and thinkers.” A parallel development occurred in Russian Armenia. Before 1840, Armenian journals were mainly {{in the hands of the}} clergy. This was changed. Along with the schools, the press played an important educational role and pointed the way to insurrection. From the first day when Rev. William Goodell settled in Constantinople in 1831 to the end of World War I, the missionaries made considerable contributions to the education of Armenians. The European intellectual currents such as ideas of French revolution were transmitted through the 23,000 Armenian students within 127 Protestant congregations with 13,000 communicants, and 400 schools.|$|E
