40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of tariff {{policies}} on evasion of customs duties, {{in the context of the}} trade reform in India of the 1990 s. By exploiting the variation in tariff rates across time and products, we identify a robust positive elasticity of evasion with respect to tariffs. A second contribution of the paper is to provide some evidence on the impact of enforcement. While we cannot identify the direct impact of enforcement on evasion, we can establish the extent to which enforcement-related factors, such as product characteristics that determine the ease of detection of evasion, affect the evasion elasticity. The results render support to the hypothesis that improvements in enforcement can reduce the responsiveness of evasion to <b>tariffs.</b> Evasion <b>Tariffs</b> <b>Enforcement...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} to developed countries, developing nations are especially reliant on trade taxes, particularly tariffs, {{as a source}} of government revenue. As such, tariff liberalization provides them with an incentive to switch towards other revenue generating trade barriers such as anti-dumping duties. The effectiveness of this is potentially limited due to the greater enforcement challenges with the exporter specific anti-dumping relative to broad-based tariffs. We examine this by estimating the impact of anti-dumping measures for 82 importing countries from 2008 - 2014. We find that anti-dumping's trade effects are larger for countries with greater policy enforcement, especially in low income countries. Although the results are somewhat sensitive to the measure of enforcement, our overall findings indicate that for countries with weak <b>enforcement,</b> <b>tariff</b> liberalization combined with a shift towards non-tariff barriers like anti-dumping is likely to lower government revenues and hamper their ability to provide the infrastructure and education needed for development...|$|R
40|$|When the World Trade Organization’s new dispute {{settlement}} machinery {{was created in}} 1995, no one knew for certain what its consequences would be. Innovative and experimental in crucial respects, it represented an extraordinary gambit by the Uruguay Round negotiators, who agreed to its creation partly out of frustration with the perceived deficits of the General Agreement of <b>Tariff</b> and Trade’s <b>enforcement</b> machinery, partly {{out of fear of}} unilateralism and partly {{in the context of a}} particular moment of post-Cold War faith in the international rule of law. Although a mythology very quickly emerged around this new {{dispute settlement}} machinery, according to which it represented a step-change from power-oriented to rule-oriented trade diplomacy, this was in truth always more of an aspirational expression rather than a statement of fact. In the mid- 1990 s, the new system had many possible futures, and its historical meaning was yet to be made. No one was more conscious of this than the seven original members of the Appellate Body, who understood well the stakes of their endeavour and felt very keenly the scrutiny of the international community as it watched how this institutional experiment would unfol...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of tariff {{policies}} on evasion of customs duties, {{in the context of the}} trade reform in India of the 1990 s. We exploit the variation in tariff rates across time and products to identify the evasion elasticity, namely, {{the effect of}} tariffs on evasion, and relate this elasticity to factors related to customs enforcement or the quality of customs institutions. We find a positive and robust effect of tariffs on import tax evasion. We then show that the evasion elasticity is influenced by certain product characteristics that determine how easy it is to detect evasion (with more differentiated products exhibiting a higher evasion elasticity). This evasion elasticity, which we broadly interpret as reflecting the quality of customs administration, has not improved over the 1990 s. Finally, our results suggest that the effectiveness of customs in addressing evasion may be better in India than China, although China appears to be catching up over time.

40|$|The role {{of trade}} {{sanctions}} in enforcing greenhouse gas mitigation agreements {{is the fundamental}} theme of the three essays comprising this dissertation. All three essays employ a multi-sector, multi-region computable general equilibrium model, GTAP-AEZ-GHG, documented in Golub et al. (2009) to investigate how the United States can use trade sanctions as an enforcement mechanism in a global greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation agreement. The focus is placed on inducing China {{to comply with the}} global agreement. ^ The first essay contributes to the body of knowledge on global GHG emissions mitigation agreements by investigating the range of emission taxes that can be enforced successfully through punitive tariffs (used by the U. S. against China). The results suggest that the ability of punitive tariffs to enforce a multilateral environmental agreement may be substantial. However, the set of credible and effective threats shrinks as the emission tax increases from 0 to $ 38 /TCE, and becomes null afterwards. Therefore, there is a trade-off between the targeted abatement level and the viability of punitive <b>tariffs</b> as an <b>enforcement</b> mechanism. The results are robust to meaningful changes in Armington elasticities. ^ The second essay investigates the economic and environmental performance of emission-based Border Tax Adjustments (BTAs) in agricultural sectors. The analysis shows that emission-based BTAs are helpful in controlling emissions leakage but not on the loss of competitiveness in agricultural sectors. It is also observed that the results about the assessment of impacts of BTAs on emissions leakage are quite sensitive to the method used to measure the emission content of products. Ignoring indirect emissions in a production chain leads to underestimation of emission content of products which as a result leads to underestimation of effectiveness of BTAs. ^ The final essay brings the understanding having been developed in Essays 1 and 2 together and investigates the viability of emission-based BTAs as an enforcement mechanism used by the U. S. against China in global GHG mitigation agreements. It is found that as long as global emission tax does not exceed $ 21. 50 /TCE threshold, and there is no legal constraints imposed by the World Trade Organization (WTO) it is possible for the U. S. to find a viable BTA level to induce China to take the same abatement measures. However, when GATT is followed and damage of pollution is not taken into account, the set of viable BTA threats is empty. Comparison of this result with the findings of the first essay of this dissertation suggests that, by providing a wider range of viable emission tax, punitive tariffs provide more stability to a global GHG mitigation agreement than emission-based BTAs. It is also observed that the maximum enforceable emissions tax (MET) increases as the marginal damage from pollution increases. For instance, increase in marginal cost of pollution from $ 0 to $ 5 /TCE increases MET by $ 8 (from $ 21. 50 /TCE to $ 30 /TCE). ...|$|R
