5|$|As Philip marched south, {{his opponents}} blocked him near Chaeronea, Boeotia. During the ensuing Battle of Chaeronea, Philip {{commanded}} {{the right wing}} and Alexander the left, accompanied {{by a group of}} Philip's trusted generals. According to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded his <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> retreat, counting on the untested Athenian hoplites to follow, thus breaking their line. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals. Having damaged the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> press forward and quickly routed them. With the Athenians lost, the Thebans were surrounded. Left to fight alone, they were defeated.|$|E
5|$|Buell quickly {{assigned}} Garfield {{the task}} of driving Confederate forces out of eastern Kentucky, giving him the 18th Brigade for the campaign, which, besides his own 42nd, included the 40th Ohio Infantry, two Kentucky infantry regiments and two cavalry units. They departed Catlettsburg, Kentucky, in mid-December, advancing through {{the valley of the}} Big Sandy River. The march was uneventful until Union forces reached Paintsville, Kentucky, on January 6, 1862, where Garfield's cavalry engaged the rebels at Jenny's Creek. Confederate troops under Brigadier General Humphrey Marshall held the town in numbers roughly equal to Garfield's own, but Garfield positioned his troops so as to deceive Marshall into believing that rebel forces were outnumbered. Marshall ordered his <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> withdraw to the forks of Middle Creek, on the road to Virginia; Garfield ordered his <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> pursue the Confederates. They attacked the rebel positions on January 9, 1862, in the Battle of Middle Creek, the only pitched battle Garfield personally commanded. At the end of the fighting, the Confederates withdrew from the field, and Garfield sent his <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> Prestonsburg to reprovision.|$|E

He initially committed 3000 <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> the operation, although this gradually rose to 11,000. He also persuaded Angola and Namibia to commit <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> the conflict. Involvement in the war cost Zimbabwe an approximate US $1 million a day, contributing to its economic problems. Opinion polls demonstrated that it was unpopular among Zimbabwe's population. However, several Zimbabwean businesses profited, having been given mining and timber concessions and preferential trade terms in minerals from Kabila's government.|$|E
