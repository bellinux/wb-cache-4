40|$|High value {{crops such as}} peas for {{the frozen}} {{vegetable}} market have to be harvested at the optimum point for quality, regardless of field conditions. Six wheeled pea harvesters with a gross weight of 27 t, giving a wheel load of 4. 5 t are required to move from field to field with optimum timeliness. In order to achieve road speeds of 25 km/h an inflation pressure of 2. 2 bar {{is required for the}} specific tyre load speed rating. Typically, in field conditions, this inflation pressure is not reduced and therefore the likelihood of soil damage is increased. This study was undertaken {{to examine the effects of}} <b>tyre</b> section <b>width</b> and inflation pressure on rolling resistance, rut depth and sub-surface soil deformation. Under controlled laboratory conditions three tyres, at three inflation pressures, with a load of 4. 5 t were passed over a soil at three different initial bulk densities. Measurements of dry bulk density, rut depth, rolling resistance, cone penetrometer resistance and soil deformation through the profile were taken before and after the passage of the tyres. The results show that by increasing the tyre size and reducing the inflation pressure the depth at which compaction occurs and rut depth decrease by 44 %. The 800 mm section tyre causes less compaction than any of the other tyres tested especially when inflated to 1. 6 bar. Rolling resistance is reduced when the tyre is inflated to the optimum for each tyre. The change in bulk density when plotted against either initial bulk density or penetration resistance results in a set of curves which can be used by the manufacturer, farmer or operator to select the correct <b>tyre</b> section <b>width</b> and inflation pressure for field conditions. As a result of this study the harvester manufacturers are investigating the engineering requirements of increasing <b>tyre</b> section <b>width</b> to 800 mm and are now equipping pea harvesters with central tyre inflation systems. The benefits of which would be to significantly reduce the amount of soil compaction, reduce rolling resistance and save the operator £ 455 000 per annum in fuel costs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{includes}} some basic knowledge {{to be considered}} when discussing {{about the quality of}} work in harvesting wood and how to monitor it. This knowledge may aid to form an appropriate view on mechanised logging, environmental issues and trade of forest products. Many forest owners feel today, that leaving a good quality of work behind is the most important requirement set for logging machinery in the future. It is possible to present to the forest machine and equipment manufacturers some ideas on how to promote and influence the development of logging machines and equipment. This paper is partly based on a literature study, partly on theme interviews. Recent literature on productivity, machine and method studies on logging was examined from the quality of work point of view. Observations supporting an improvement in the quality of work were recorded. The idea was not to find out the level of the quality of work in practice as such, but to assess the relationships between the methods, machines and equipment used in respect to the quality of work. The interviews were conducted from May 22, 2000 to October 2, 2000 in Finland. The data consisted of six persons responsible for logging in a wood procurement district, six representatives of forest machine manufacturers and five logging contractors. A good quality of work in logging is characterised by doing it in an agreed way. Indicators for reaching the goals are evaluated by assessing the damages caused to the remaining trees, the rut formation, the strip road spacing and width, the way the thinning regimes are followed and the choice of trees to be cut. The target level is formed as a joint effect e. g. of efficiency in wood production, of credibility of mechanised operations, of considering the environment and of fluency in trade of forest products. Contributing factors to reach a good quality of work are the organisation of the logging, the forest machine operator as well as the machine and equipment technique. These factors may get a weighting value. However, the final result is a product of these factors, and all of them have to be considered. When looking at the situation today the human influence in logging, especially the role of the operator, is getting more emphasis. On the other hand, in the long run the possibilities to develop appropriate technologies are dominating, especially the use of new technologies. From {{the point of view of}} logging machinery the main factors affecting the work results, are the mobility of the vehicle, how to operate it and the work environment. In this paper, based on the development needs and possibilities, those aspects are looked at. An assessment of the present state is given and presents a basis for a more precise prediction of realistic targets. Based on a literature review and interviews conducted, it is possible to conclude, that there still is great potential to improve the quality of work in logging. Some direct technical improvements could promote the quality of work, but there are even some other actions, which indirectly through the operator would have a positive effect. An improved quality of work is often also improving the productivity in work. Furthermore it makes the organising of the logging operations easier and makes it possible to operate in a more demanding work environment even year around and 24 hours a day. The following is a list of research and development (R&D) needs concerning forest machinery, where inputs would be justified: •	Better visibility (illumination, no dazzling, visibility) •	Analysis of the CTI-system and eventual construction and testing of a test machine •	The properties of <b>tyres</b> (<b>width,</b> diameter, tread, pressure) and their development •	Control of the crane and its development (e. g. the automatic functions) •	The role of a rotating cab on the operator, his productivity and the work result •	Research into the role of levelling (seat, cabin, whole machine) •	Steering of the machine (turning radius, “cutting” of corners) and possibilities to develop a vehicle with frame-steering and turning wheels •	Research into the possibilities to utilise on-board weighing scales •	Lighter machine construction •	The role of tracks and comparison of different tracks •	The role of a balanced boggie and its comparison with a single wheel •	The role of the size of the harvester head on the operation control, work result and productivity •	Possibilities to increase automation •	Possibilities of work rotation and its effect on a normal logging system •	The effect of a harwarder (harvester-forwarder) on the operator’s work 28 p...|$|R

40|$|The {{foundation}} {{of this research}} work was laid by {{the vision of a}} tractor simulator where the users can generate their customized tractor model with the help of just a user-interface. The aim of this paper was to modify the attributes of the tractor simulation model. For the same reason, a modeling configurator was developed for the tractor model in python programming language with a user-friendly interface designed over Microsoft excel. This research work reports the effort in the development of modeling configurator for parameterizing a tractor model. The modeling configurator has been designed {{in such a way that}} the users can select their choices just from a drop down menu in the user-interface. The attributes that can be parameterized are maximum torque of the engine, maximum braking torque for the engine, number of forward and reverse gears. For tyre modeling, special attention was paid as the modeling configurator allowed users to select only from the standard <b>tyres</b> available, whose <b>width</b> and diameter are predefined. The mass and number of tyres can also be modified. At last, additional equipment that can be used in farming was also modeled as an assembly file. For additional equipment, only trailer has been covered within the scope of this research work whose mass is predefined. The modeling configurator was validated by selecting different options in the user-interface and then running the simulation file and noting down the differences. Some differences can be visualized like the number of tyres and attached trailer, while other differences can be seen with the help of plots like maximum torque of the engine, gear index, and tyre profiles. For the masses of the tyres, user can only feel the difference while running the simulator in real-time. At the end of the research, scope for future work is also suggested based on the limitations of this research work...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{a study of the}} effect of the passage of multi-axle {{harvesting}} machines on the soil physical properties. In particular, it investigates the effect of the rear tyre of a combine harvester on the amount of soil compaction subsequent to the passage of the front tyre/track. The work was conducted in controlled laboratory conditions to determine the effect of a simulated self-propelled combine harvester with a total machine weight of 30 – 33 t. This was assessed by embedding talcum powder tracer lines in the soil to measure soil displacement and soil density changes. Dry bulk density and penetrometer resistance were also measured. The results showed that the benefit of the rubber track found by Ansorge and Godwin [2007 a. The effect of tyres and a rubber track at high axle loads on soil compaction: Part 1 : Single Axle Studies. Biosystems Engineering 98 (1), 115 – 126] was maintained after the additional passage of the rear tyre. After the passage of a track the effect of rear tyre size was insignificant, but the rear tyre size had a significant influence on soil density when following a leading tyre. This was due to a higher strength layer at the soil surface created by the track which was able to withstand the load of the subsequent passes and protect the soil below from further compaction. Results similar to those found for a tracked machine were also achieved by three passes of a 900 mm section <b>width</b> <b>tyre</b> at 5 t load and 0. 5 bar inflation pressure. The track results for the 33 t machine were very similar to those of a smaller combine harvester with a total load of 11 t and similar rut width. The study confirmed the benefit of tracks with regard to soil compaction and emphasised the fact that total axle loads and machine weights are less important than how the loads are distributed to the soil...|$|R
40|$|At this conference, {{the subject}} of tyre/road noise is on the agenda {{to a greater extent}} than ever before. This paper aims at giving an insight into the past, present and future of tyre/road noise {{emission}} in the society as well as its control. This is made by means of exploring some myths and realities related to the subject. The following myths are explored: 1. Tyre/road noise has become a concern only during the last decades, say from the 1970 's. It is shown that already long ago tyre/road noise was an important issue. 2. Tyre/road noise is an important part of vehicle noise at speeds above 50 km/h (70 for trucks). The truth is that nowadays tyre/road noise dominates during almost all types of driving for cars and down to about 40 km/h for trucks (vehicles meeting EU requirements). 3. Manufacturers have done a lot to reduce vehicle and tyre/road noise. Yes, in some respects; but yet it seems that vehicle noise sometimes has increased rather than decreased. 4. The speed influence is large but not very interesting. It is shown that there are unexpected relations between speed-related factors and that these can be useful in data presentation. 5. Different road surfaces may give a large variation in noise levels. True, the variation is very large, albeit the most common and useful surfaces are close together on the noise scale. 6. Tyres do not differ very much in noise emission. This is not true, the variation is large if sufficiently many tyre types are included in the data set. 7. Winter tyres are much more noisy than summer tyres. This is a myth based on the past. Currently, winter tyres may be the "quiet" <b>tyres.</b> 8. The <b>width</b> of the <b>tyre</b> is a very influential factor. Essentially true: A noise-width relation covering the range from "tiny" bicycle tyres to large truck tyres is presented. 9. Tyre/road noise from a heavy truck is far above that of a typical car. Not true, one may find heavy trucks that emit lower tyre/road noise than some cars. 10. Tyre/road noise is very broadband nowadays. True and not true - current tyres emit noise very much concentrated within the 1 kHz octave. Tone correction may be considered. 11. Quiet tyres are possible only if sacrificing safety. Recent results show that there is no tradeoff between low noise emission and high safety; neither with rolling resistance. 12. We cannot afford to reduce tyre/road noise. Calculation exercises are presented that suggest that low-noise tyres as well as low-noise road surfaces may be very cost efficient. 13. Tyre/road noise will be substantially reduced by the introduction of noise emission limits. Not true; the new EU emission tyre noise limits will be almost totally ineffective...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to improve the {{characteristics}} of surfacing methods/materials for the temporary support of military vehicles travelling over weak soils. Both off road travel and poor existing road networks provide problems for vehicle mobility in military operations under these conditions. Conventional road construction materials are often in short supply and engineered solutions such as Class 30 & 70 Trackway are expensive and form a significant logistical burden on the military supply chain. In this situation the use of locally available alternative materials in the construction of temporary roads can reduce the time taken to get routes operational, allowing the tempo of operations to be maintained. The work reported focussed on two main areas of work, namely: i) The development of a technique for assessing the soil support capacity in the form of a flat plate (45 x 30 mm) penetrometer to aid the decision/ planning process when faced with poor soil support, and ii) the evaluation of the relative performance of a range of alternative materials/ techniques in laboratory conditions at 1 / 5 '*’ scale and full size. The results of load-sinkage tests of a family of plate sizes indicate that by normalising the data with respect to plate width a common relationship existed for all plate sizes in each of the soil conditions investigated. From this, a technique was developed to estimate the load support of a plate with dimensions equivalent to the contact patch of a tyre using load-sinkage data from a small plate penetrometer, allowing estimates of: i) sinkage or rut depth expected from a vehicle load, and ii) the load at a sinkage equivalent to the <b>tyre</b> contact patch <b>width,</b> a point at which the vehicles were assumed to be immobilised. Comparison between the rut depth of a single pass of a towed wheel and the sinkage from plate tests (45 x 30 mm) were within 20 % in a sandy loam soil of bulk unit weight 12. 2 and 13. 4 kN/m^. Load sinkage predictions of a 450 x 300 mm plate from a small plate penetrometer were within 35 % in a sandy loam soil with bulk unit weights of 11. 7 and 13. 4 kN/m^. Load sinkage predictions for a very weak sandy loam (11. 3 kN/m^) and loose sand (15. 1 - 16. 1 kN/m^) soils tended to be significantly underestimated especially at large plate sizes, mainly due to scaling effects in these David Shorten, 2004 Cranfield University, Silsoe 11 situations as well as the significant re-arranging occurring in weak soil subjected to loaded plates. Improvements in accuracy to 25 - 35 % could be made in these conditions by increasing the size of the plate penetrometer to 90 x 60 mm and utilising a similitude scaling technique. Materials/techniques for improving soil support have been classified into 4 categories, namely: sheet materials, rigid members, aggregate materials and stabilisation techniques. The use of sheet materials, in this case a Hessian geotextile, proved effective in improving the in situ soil support; it was possible to optimise the width and placement depth to increase load support by a factor of 1. 8. A folded confinement technique encapsulating a soil fill was developed further, resulting in a 3 -fold improvement in the load support. Tied corduroy techniques performed best with a 5 - fold improvement in load support. Factors such as the rope tension between members were found to be important to produce a stable road surface. The performance of aggregates increased with larger aggregate sizes. Increasing the thickness of the aggregate layer enhanced load support in stone aggregate, while in wood and rubber aggregate performance is affected by the initial compressibility of the material. Aggregate mixed with a sand filler proved effective at reducing the compressibility of the alternative aggregate materials, thus enhancing performance. The use of alternative materials in military operations has been identified as very scenario dependent. Alternative materials have been shown to increase the load support capability of weak soils. Although alternative materials are unlikely to be used as a substitute in conventional road construction, their use on short sections of roadway is feasible. Situations where conventional aggregate materials are limited and an alternative aggregate can be obtained locally would offer a solution enabling military operations to continue. Significant quantities of materials are required to construct even small sections of roadway in weak soil conditions; success is very much dependent on the amount of material locally available, for example a 100 m section may require 180 m^ of timber aggregate approximately equal to 0. 25 ha of a 45 yr Sitka Spruce plantation. This information will be of use to aid decisions made by the Combat Engineer and has been recommended by the MOD for inclusion in the Military Engineering Volume...|$|R
