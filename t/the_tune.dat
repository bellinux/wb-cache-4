In the course of the game, Link learns three tunes to play on the harp. <b>The</b> <b>Tune</b> of Echoes activates Time Portals at fixed locations; <b>the</b> <b>Tune</b> of Currents enables Link to travel from the past to the present without a Time Portal; <b>the</b> <b>Tune</b> of Ages allows Link to switch between the two time periods at almost any location on the map.|$|E
5|$|A song {{is taught}} to many {{elementary}} school children across the state, entitled the Maine County Song, to aid in memorizing {{the names of the}} state's 16counties. It is sung to <b>the</b> <b>tune</b> of Yankee Doodle.|$|E
5|$|Another tune was {{recorded}} in Samuel Arnold's Juvenile Amusements in 1797. E. F. Rimbault's Nursery Rhymes (1836) has the same first line, but then a different tune. <b>The</b> <b>tune</b> now associated with the rhyme was first recorded in 1879 in the US in A. H.

50|$|With all {{preselector}}s {{there is}} some loss at <b>the</b> <b>tuned</b> frequency; usually, most of the loss is in <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> coil (<b>the</b> ‘inductor’). <b>Tuning</b> <b>the</b> preselector for narrower bandwidth (or higher , or greater selectivity) increases this loss.|$|R

40|$|When a {{tuning fork}} is sounded {{and held in}} the air, the sound is weak due to the poor {{acoustic}} coupling between <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> fork and <b>the</b> air. If <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> fork is struck and acoustically coupled to a box of the proper size, as in Figure 1, the box functions as a resonator at the frequency of <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> fork, <b>the</b> sound of <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> fork is much louder, as can be heard on the video. When <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> fork is placed on a box of a different resonant frequency, the sound does not become as loud, as demonstrated in the video...|$|R
5|$|In 1964, Ch. Courtenay Fleetfoot of Pennyworth {{won best}} in {{show at the}} Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. In 1992, Pencloe Dutch Gold won best in show at Crufts, and a Whippet known as Cobyco Call <b>the</b> <b>Tune</b> won in 2004. In 2011, GCh.

5|$|It {{was later}} {{claimed by the}} Nazis that Wessel also wrote the music to the song, but it was {{considered}} more likely that <b>the</b> <b>tune</b> was in reality adapted from a World War I German Imperial Navy song, and was probably originally a folk song. The authorship of the melody was finally determined by a German court in 1937 as not by Wessel.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Evans-Jones as Wallace Hartley: The ship's bandmaster and violinist {{who plays}} {{uplifting}} music with his {{colleagues on the}} boat deck as the ship sinks. As the final plunge begins, he leads the band in a final performance of Nearer, My God, to Thee, to <b>the</b> <b>tune</b> of Bethany, and dies in the sinking.|$|E
50|$|Once the {{temperament}} octave is <b>tuned,</b> <b>the</b> tuner <b>tunes</b> <b>the</b> other {{notes on the}} piano using octave intervals to align them, first to <b>the</b> <b>tuned</b> notes in <b>the</b> temperament octave, and lastly to <b>the</b> already <b>tuned</b> notes below and above.|$|R
50|$|During <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> fork test, <b>the</b> tester {{will have}} <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> fork vibrate {{so that it}} makes a sound. <b>The</b> <b>tuning</b> fork is placed in a {{specific}} place around the participant and hearing is observed. In some instances, individuals will show trouble hearing in places such as behind the ear.|$|R
50|$|Equal temperaments {{useful as}} meantone tunings include (in order of {{increasing}} generator width) 19-ET, 50-ET, 31-ET, 43-ET, and 55-ET. <b>The</b> farther <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> gets away from quarter-comma meantone, however, the less related <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> is to harmonic timbres, {{which can be}} overcome by tempering the timbre to match <b>the</b> <b>tuning.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{music of}} the two stanzas of the chorale is identical. <b>The</b> <b>tune</b> {{is not a simple}} four-part setting as in most of Bach's later cantatas, but the voices are {{embedded}} in a concerto of the orchestra, led by violin I and oboe I. The instrumental theme is derived from the first line of the chorale tune.|$|E

5|$|When Carey {{tries to}} open up a bit more, her sentiments are the {{equivalent}} of a Hallmark Precious Moments figurine. In a ballad 'Bye Bye', Carey isn't taking chances, designing the lyrics for mass appeal by dedicating them to anyone who ever lost somebody, be it 'your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady'. But Carey gracefully pulls off the universality of the lyrics, and <b>the</b> <b>tune</b> will likely be a massive hit.|$|E
50|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> stop {{is fully}} in <b>tune</b> with itself, <b>the</b> rest of <b>the</b> stops are <b>tuned.</b> Most stops are <b>tuned</b> to <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> stop, though some stops {{are more easily}} tuned to stops other than a 4&prime; Principal.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tuned</b> circuit resonates at one frequency, {{the fixed}} carrier frequency, {{and so the}} {{unwanted}} frequencies are suppressed, and the wanted full signal (sine wave) is extracted by <b>the</b> <b>tuned</b> load. <b>The</b> signal bandwidth of the amplifier {{is limited by the}} Q-factor of <b>the</b> <b>tuned</b> circuit {{but this is not a}} serious limitation. Any residual harmonics can be removed using a further filter.|$|R
50|$|In his {{introduction}} Praetorius takes credit for arranging the music rather than composing <b>the</b> <b>tunes.</b> <b>The</b> collection {{is based on}} French dance repertoire of the time, although scholars have identified some of <b>the</b> <b>tunes</b> as coming from elsewhere, for example England.|$|R
5|$|As a song full of {{gospel and}} soulful influences, it allowed Mariah to really tear loose and show {{what she could}} do – which in reality was {{far more than the}} vocal {{gymnastics}} that seemed to comprise her reputation so far. From a deep rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as the power of <b>the</b> <b>tune</b> built. The backing vocals – which once again had those churchy harmonies – filled out the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song was truly a vocal showcase for Mariah.|$|E
5|$|Bach used <b>the</b> <b>tune</b> as a cantus firmus, {{played by}} a trumpet, in an aria of his cantata Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12 (1714). He closed his 1723 Christmas cantata Sehet, welch eine Liebe hat uns der Vater erzeiget, BWV 64, with the fifth stanza, and his 1724 cantata Jesus schläft, was soll ich hoffen? BWV 81, with the second stanza. The closing chorale of cantata Bisher habt ihr nichts gebeten in meinem Namen, BWV 87, (1725) is a stanza from a hymn by Heinrich Müller on the same tune.|$|E
5|$|Humpty Dumpty is a {{character}} in an English nursery rhyme, probably originally a riddle {{and one of the}} best known in the English-speaking world. He is typically portrayed as a personified egg, though he is not explicitly described as such. The first recorded versions of the rhyme date from late eighteenth-century England and <b>the</b> <b>tune</b> from 1870 in James William Elliott's National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs. Its origins are obscure and several theories have been advanced to suggest original meanings.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>tuning</b> {{properties}} of <b>the</b> ensemble of cone photoreceptors {{is due to}} <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> {{properties of}} individual cones convolved with the disarray in pointing direction between the cones. We used direct imaging with the Rochester adaptive optics ophthalmoscope to directly image these properties in individual cones in living human eyes. We found that cone disarray is very small, accounting for less than 1 % of the breadth of <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> function of an ensemble of cones. The implication is that the optical fiber properties of an ensemble of cones mimic <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> properties of a single cone...|$|R
50|$|The Ainsworth Psalter {{provided}} most of <b>the</b> <b>tunes</b> {{in use in}} New England church music {{until the}} late 17th century, when congregations abandoned the Psalter, claiming <b>the</b> <b>tunes</b> were too complex and difficult to sing.|$|R
5|$|National anthems {{are usually}} {{written in the}} most common {{language}} of the state, whether de facto or official. States with multiple national languages may offer several versions of their anthem. For instance, Switzerland's national anthem has different lyrics {{for each of the}} country's four official languages: French, German, Italian, and Romansh. The New Zealand national anthem is commonly now sung with the first verse in Māori ("Aotearoa") and the second in English ("God Defend New Zealand"). <b>The</b> <b>tune</b> is the same but the lyrics have different meanings. South Africa's national anthem is unique in that five of the eleven official languages are used in the same anthem, in which each language comprises a stanza.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} nineteenth century the rhyme has been seen {{as one of the most}} popular and well known in the English-speaking world. It has also been {{referenced}} in both literature and popular culture. It was used by T. S. Eliot at the climax of his poem The Waste Land (1922). The final line of the verse was probably the inspiration for the title of Lerner and Loewe's 1956 musical My Fair Lady. <b>The</b> <b>tune</b> is often used by English football supporters as the basis for chants.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stop}} is District 11, {{the home of}} Katniss' {{deceased}} friend and Hunger Games ally, Rue. During the ceremony, Katniss delivers an impromptu, heartfelt speech expressing her feelings toward Rue and also Thresh, who spared her life. When she finishes, an old man whistles <b>the</b> <b>tune</b> that Rue used in the arena to tell Katniss that she was safe. Everyone else salutes Katniss, using the same gesture {{that she used to}} say farewell to Rue. To Katniss's horror, the old man is quickly executed before her eyes.|$|E
5000|$|The German word Stimmung [...] {{has several}} meanings, {{including}} [...] "tuning" [...] and [...] "mood". The word is the noun formed from the verb stimmen, which means [...] "to harmonize, to be correct", {{and related to}} Stimme (voice). The primary sense of the title [...] "implies not only <b>the</b> outward <b>tuning</b> of voices or instruments, but also <b>the</b> inward <b>tuning</b> of one's soul" [...] According to the composer, the word [...] means [...] "tuning," [...] but it really should be translated with many other words because Stimmung incorporates the meanings of <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> of a piano, <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> of <b>the</b> voice, <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> {{of a group of}} people, <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> of <b>the</b> soul. This is all in the German word. Also, when you say: We're in a good Stimmung, you mean a good psychological tuning, being well tuned together.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tuning</b> of <b>the</b> piano used in The Well-Tuned Piano is {{the most}} {{important}} aspect of the piece. When Young dates the piece as 1964-73-81-Present, the years 1973 and 1981 identify significant changes in <b>the</b> <b>tuning.</b>|$|R

5|$|The song {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} {{from most of}} the critics, who noted that Gaga's featured appearance failed to add anything to <b>the</b> <b>tune.</b> The original version charted in the lower regions of the charts of Australia and its Urban chart, Spain, United Kingdom and on the US R charts. The remixed version charted at sixty-five on the Billboard Hot 100, and topped the Dance Club Songs chart. It also charted in Australia and its Urban chart, the Czech Republic, New Zealand, while it bubbled under the main charts of Belgium.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} a primary {{theme of the}} film score for The Boy with Green Hair (1948), for which the {{original}} version was used. The producers of the film reportedly paid $10,000 to ahbez for using the song, which was cumulatively more than what {{the author of the}} story, Betsy Beaton, was paid. A recording by Kate Ceberano was featured in the film The Crossing (1990). <b>The</b> <b>tune</b> and lyrics feature prominently in the film Untamed Heart (1993), for which Cole's version was used during the closing credits, while a piano version by Roger Williams served as the opener for the film. The song was also played in intermediate scenes featuring the principal cast.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{opens with}} a small {{microscopic}} organism-like figure, eventually zooming out on an animated woman. Dancing in the wind, the opening chorus has the woman gliding through a vast field of clouds, often flying {{in front of the}} sun. A strong force field follows her as she is about to land onto buildings, but intercuts into Utada walking through digitized clouds. The camera then changes positions, aimed towards the singer, and showcases her walking through a large grand hall with purple colored Kachina's in cloaks, hitting drums to the songs beat. She walks into a large cathedral-like infrastructure and summons numerous pink kachina's dancing to <b>the</b> <b>tune.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> actual <b>tuning</b> {{process begins}} with <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> of <b>the</b> [...] "tuning stop", the stop to which {{most or all}} other stops will be <b>tuned</b> in turn. <b>The</b> <b>tuning</b> stop is usually the 4&prime; Octave or Principal (Diapason) in each division. The middle octave is usually tuned first, either by ear, or using some sort of {{electronic}} <b>tuning</b> device. <b>The</b> rest of <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> stop is tuned to itself, in octaves. That is, tenor C is tuned to middle C, tenor D to middle D, and so forth.|$|R
