25|$|Engerman and Sokoloff {{conclude}} that while institutions heavily influenced {{the success of}} each colony, no individual <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>institution</b> {{is the source of}} economic and state growth. Other variables such as factor endowments, technologies, and the creation of property rights are just as crucial in societal development. To encourage state success an institution must be adaptable and suited to find the most economical source of growth. The authors also argue that while not the only means for success, institutional development has long lasting-economic and social effects on the state.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that more {{selective}} colleges and universities require higher mathematics and reading scores for admittance than less selective colleges and universities. Less is known about how mathematics and reading scores relate to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> college or university attended. The present paper examines this question by considering the influence of mathematics and reading scores on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> college attended using data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002. The analysis uses test scores taken when students were sophomores in high school to predict <b>type</b> <b>of</b> college attended as measured by the Carnegie Basic Classification. The results show a clear ordering of universities with students with higher mathematics and reading scores more likely to attend research universities/very high research/private than any other category. There were three additional types that higher scoring students preferred to attend including two more <b>types</b> <b>of</b> private <b>institutions</b> and one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> public <b>institution.</b> These top four categories captured 37 percent of respondents. The next four most preferred <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>institutions,</b> capturing 25 percent of respondents, included three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> private <b>institutions</b> and one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> public <b>institution.</b> The eight <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>institutions,</b> capturing 38 percent of respondents, that were least preferred by higher scoring students included six <b>types</b> <b>of</b> public <b>institutions</b> and two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> private <b>institutions...</b>|$|R

At 14, he worked as an apprentice to a wood-carver, until the age of 18, when he entered the studio of Katsukawa Shunshō. Shunshō was an artist of ukiyo-e, a style of wood block prints and paintings that Hokusai would master, and head of the so-called Katsukawa school. Ukiyo-e, as practiced by artists like Shunshō, focused on images of the courtesans and Kabuki actors who were popular in Japan's cities at the time.|$|E

The study concluded that the government's general subsidies to public institutions may have been regressive in that they more often benefit students who are in less need of them, and that although the establishment <b>of</b> new <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>institutions</b> has created new opportunities for accessing higher education, it has also led to new inequalities in terms of the relative cost and prestige of education at different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>institutions.</b> © 2011 M.

2500|$|Alodia's {{size and}} the fact that it survived for over 900 years {{suggests}} a rather sophisticated political organization, even though the sources are especially sparse on this matter. The head of the state was obviously the king. Just like in Makuria the succession was matrilineal, which means that not the kings son, but the son of the kings sister became the new king. This custom was already practiced in Meroitic times and is a testament of the political influence of women in the historical Sudan, even though in Medieval times one doesn't hear anything about reigning queens anymore. The fact that the kings had a fixed capital at Soba, where they would reign as, according to Al-Aswani, [...] "absolute" [...] monarchs, is an indicator of a fairly centralized form of government. Nevertheless, Al-Aswanis [...] "absolute" [...] should not be identified with an absolute monarchy à la early modern France. There would not only have been the queenmother, but perhaps also some <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>institution</b> to keep the king in check, like for example a council of elders how it is attested for Alodia's successor, the Sultanate of Sennar.|$|E
60|$|In many cases, {{let it be}} remembered, {{such action}} is not merely {{going back to the}} old ideal, but is even going back to the old reality.

Parliament did once really mean (as its name seems to imply) a place where people were allowed to talk.

The poor do not go to the modern church, but they went to the ancient church all right; and if the common man in the past had a grave respect for property, it may conceivably have been because he sometimes had some of his own. I therefore can claim that I have no vulgar itch of innovation in anything I say about any of these institutions. Certainly I have none in that particular one which I am now obliged to pick out of the list; a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>institution</b> to which I have genuine and personal reasons for being friendly and grateful: I mean the great Tudor foundations, the public schools of England.

An exhaustive review of the literature on academic lineage was used to develop this research. All stratified random sample <b>of</b> 260 <b>institutions</b> from 2, 873 colleges and universities was selected by Carnegie Foundation classification categories. Institutions were selected at random until the number of faculty members in each category corresponded to the estimated national distribution of faculty across Carnegie classification categories (n= 3, 940). The analyses revealed that the majority of faculty (74 %) employed at all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> higher education <b>institutions</b> obtained their doctoral degrees fromresearch I institutions. Professional academic rank is an interaction between doctoral-granting institution and employing institution combined with gender. Male faculty are following the traditional "trickle down" theory of academic lineage while women faculty appear to be charting a different career path. Another unique finding was that there was not significant variability in the findings across academic disciplines. Academic success is a complex phenomenon that is not singularly explainable by academic lineage. As more women are entering into the academic ranks of higher education, changes in academic lineage are beginning to appear. The inflexibility and segmentation discussed in previous research is undergoing subtle but statistically noticeable modifications...|$|R
