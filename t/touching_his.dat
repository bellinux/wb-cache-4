5|$|A {{dominant}} male black wildebeest {{will have}} a harem of females and will not allow other males to mate with them. The breeding season occurs {{at the end of}} the rainy season and lasts a few weeks between February and April. When one of his females comes into oestrus the male concentrates on her and mates with her several times. Sexual behaviour by the male at this time includes stretching low, ears down, sniffing of the female's vulva, performing ritual urination and <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> chin to the female's rump. At the same time, the female keeps her tail upwards (sometimes vertically) or swishes it across the face of the male. The pair usually separates after copulation, but the female occasionally follows her mate afterwards, <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> rump with her snout. During the breeding season, the male loses condition as he spends little time grazing. Males are known to mount other males.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{released}} on December 24, 2010. It was directed by Don Tyler, who previously worked on videos for the bands A Day to Remember and Flyleaf. It was digitally released on June 14, 2011 via iTunes Store and the same day was also uploaded on the band's Vevo channel on YouTube. Shot in an animated technique, the video starts with an animated version of lead singer Levine singing on a microphone while hands are behind his back <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> body. As the video progresses, a nude animated woman is shown dancing around him and flirting with {{the other members of}} the band. Several animation effects such as angel wings and devil elements are shown behind Levine as he is singing, while the woman is also dancing for the other members. The video finishes with a close shot of Levine's face.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the second}} round of pit stops, Räikkönen was five seconds ahead of Hamilton, but Hamilton began to close in on Räikkönen during the last stint {{as a result of the}} tyres better suiting his McLaren Mercedes. Heavy rain began to fall on lap41. Hamilton closed the gap on Räikkönen to under a second, still sixseconds ahead of Massa. Hamilton {{attempted}} to pass Räikkönen at the Bus Stop chicane, but he cut across the corner. Consequently, Hamilton led out of the chicane but allowed Räikkönen to re-pass him halfway down the straight. Hamilton then passed him again at the La Source hairpin under braking. Räikkönen tried to double-back on Hamilton to regain the position but the line was defended, resulting in Räikkönen <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> front wing on Hamilton's rear tyre. The rain started coming down more heavily and Nico Rosberg spun at Fagnes corner, rejoining in front of the two frontrunners and causing Hamilton to run onto the grass. At the next corner, Räikkönen spun and gave the lead back to Hamilton. Räikkönen then lost control of his Ferrari through the Blanchimont corner and collided with the barrier, ending his race.|$|E

5|$|The {{definition}} of leg before wicket (lbw) is currently Law 36 in the Laws of Cricket, {{written by the}} Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Before a batsman can be dismissed lbw, the fielding team must appeal to the umpire. If the bowler delivers a no ball — an illegal delivery — the batsman cannot be out lbw under any circumstances. Otherwise, for the batsman to be adjudged lbw, the ball, if it bounces, must pitch in line with or on the off side of the wickets. Then the ball must strike part of the batsman's body without first <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> bat, {{in line with the}} wickets and have been going on to hit the stumps. The batsman may also be out lbw if, having made no attempt to hit the ball with his bat, he is struck outside the line of off stump by a ball that would have hit the wickets. The umpire must assume that the ball would have continued on the same trajectory after striking the batsman, even if it would have bounced before hitting the stumps.|$|E
25|$|The {{description}} of Kalantaka {{is found in}} Agamic texts. The right foot should be rested on a lotus-pedestal (padma-pitha) and the left leg lifted to kick Yama, just <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> chest. The leg positions are reversed in some textual descriptions. Sometimes, Shiva is depicted as rising from the linga that Markandeya is worshipping and his right leg is buried in the linga while the left one raised to strike Yama. Shiva, depicted red in anger, should have a third eye on the forehead, a jatamukuta (a crown of matted hair), lateral tusks and four or eight arms.|$|E
25|$|In late 17th-century England, a {{homeless}} boy named Gwynplaine rescues an infant girl during a snowstorm, her mother having frozen to death whilst feeding her. They meet an itinerant carnival vendor {{who calls himself}} Ursus, and his pet wolf, Homo. Gwynplaine's mouth has been mutilated into a perpetual grin; Ursus is initially horrified, then moved to pity, and he takes them in. Fifteen years later, Gwynplaine {{has grown into a}} strong young man, attractive except for his distorted visage. The girl, now named Dea, is blind, and has grown into a beautiful and innocent young woman. By <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> face, Dea concludes that Gwynplaine is perpetually happy. They fall in love. Ursus and his surrogate children earn a meagre living in the fairs of southern England. Gwynplaine keeps the lower half of his face concealed. In each town, Gwynplaine gives a stage performance in which the crowds are provoked to laughter when Gwynplaine reveals his grotesque face.|$|E

25|$|The Zohar, one of {{the primary}} sources of Kabbalah (a form of Jewish mysticism), {{attributes}} holiness to the beard, and strongly discourages its removal, declaring that even the shortening of a beard by scissors is a great sin; it was even said that Isaac Luria, a significant figure in the history of Kabbalistic mysticism, meticulously avoided <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> beard, lest he should accidentally cause hairs to drop from it. Kabbalistic teachings gradually spread into Slavonic regions, and consequently beard trimming was discouraged in these areas, even if it involved scissors; it was the Hasidic Jews who more closely followed Kabbalistic practices than Jews of a Lithuanian or Misnagdish background, and thus it became the Hasidic Jews who are known for the distinctive traditional practice of growing their beards. However, in Italy, shaving the beard was so popular that even the Italian followers of Kabbalah did it; an Italian Kabbalist even went to the extent of arguing that beard shaving was only prohibited in Canaan, and was actually to be encouraged elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|She {{intended}} the final corrida of the 1949 season, in Jaén, Spain, {{to be the}} last of her career. She appeared in the ring together with the matadors Manolo Vázquez and Antonio Ordóñez. After performing on horseback with the bull, Cintrón rode to the box of the presidente and asked for permission to dismount for the kill. Permission was denied. This was her signal to leave the arena, and leave the killing of the bull to the novillero assigned to her for that task. Instead, she dismounted, grabbed his sword and muleta, caped the bull and prepared it for the kill. She actually went in for the kill and then dramatically let the sword drop to the sand. The bull charged. Cintrón stepped from his path and simulated the kill by <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> shoulders with her fingers as he rushed by. Pandemonium erupted in the stands and the audience threw hats and red carnations at her feet. The novillero then entered the ring and performed the kill, as originally planned.|$|E

He went [...] "all out" [...] and did his best to make Homer's grimaces as humorous as possible, to keep the episode at least somewhat lighter in tone. Silverman added some special touches: for example, when Homer has an out of body experience, his foot was still <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> body to signify that he was not dead.

2500|$|During {{the landing}} at Anzac Cove during the Battle of Gallipoli on 25 April, Bacchante {{suppressed}} Turkish artillery positions at Gaba Tepe after <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> bow {{the beach for}} a better position from which to engage the guns. She provided fire support for forces near Anzac Cove {{for the next several}} months, particularly during the Third attack on Anzac Cove on 19 May when she, together with three predreadnought battleships, effectively suppressed the Turkish artillery assigned to support the attack. On 28 May Bacchante and the destroyer [...] destroyed enemy shipping in Budrum harbour. Three months later the cruiser bombarded Turkish troops during the Battle of Lone Pine on 6 August and Battle of Chunuk Bair 7–9 August. She was not present when the Allies began to evacuate Gallipoli in December, but her captain, Algernon Boyle, commanded the evacuation at Anzac Cove.|$|E
2500|$|Joan Armatrading {{was born}} in 1950 in Basseterre on the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts, the third of six children. Her father was a {{carpenter}} and {{her mother was a}} housewife. When she was three years old, her parents moved with their two eldest boys to Birmingham, England, while Joan was sent to live with her grandmother on the Caribbean island of Antigua. In early 1958 at the age of seven, she joined her parents in Brookfields, then a district of Birmingham. The area is now mostly demolished and has been absorbed into the district of Hockley. Her father had played in a band in his youth, later forbidding his children from <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> guitar. At about the age of 14, Armatrading began writing songs by setting her own limericks to music on a piano that her mother had purchased as [...] "a piece of furniture". Shortly thereafter, her mother bought her a £3 guitar (...) from a pawn shop in exchange for two prams, and the younger Armatrading began teaching herself the instrument.|$|E
2500|$|The narrow {{lanes of}} Bowbazar have {{numerous}} kothas - quarters which house numerous {{singing and dancing}} girls (baijis). There are renowned dance teachers coaching the dancing girls. The Telegraph carried a candid report, [...] "The Kathak master who would arrive every day in a rickshaw through the narrow alleys of Bowbazar was the famed Kathak guru Ram Narayan Mishra of the Lucknow gharana (school). He was accompanied {{by one of his}} young students, a boy named Chitresh Das. Das remembers his guru going from baiji-quarter to baiji-quarter, the burly bouncers <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> feet, mothers of baijis in their zari (gold-bordered saris) personally dressing a paan (betel leaf) for him." [...] There used to be rules and norms, and Bowbazar was meant for the cultured rich. In olden days if anyone misbehaved, they were just told, [...] "Matlab se aaye, jaiye Sonagachi (if you have come with bad intentions, go to Sonagachi, the red light district)." [...] However, things have changed and the kothas of Bowbazar are in decline.|$|E

2500|$|The {{singing is}} done in soft British Received Pronunciation-style accents {{in the style of}} the Pet Shop Boys and their song [...] "West End Girls", with Samberg {{additionally}} comparing the beat to the works of producer Timbaland. The video opens with Samberg in a night club singing as he is about to hit on a girl (Molly Sims). They head to her apartment, share a kiss in the hallway outside her door, but once she says that [...] "she wants some more" [...] (i.e. sex), [...] he [...] "jizzes" [...] prematurely. He refuses to apologize, saying it would be [...] "absurd" [...] and blames the girl for overstimulating him by <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> buttocks, before he goes home [...] "and change". Taccone is then shown in a grocery store (where Justin Timberlake makes a cameo appearance as a janitor) conversing with a check-out girl (Jamie-Lynn Sigler), but jizzes in his pants as well when she asks, [...] "Cash or credit?" [...] After explaining that the way she bags cans got him [...] "bothered and hot", he tells her that he will pay by check.|$|E
2500|$|The 2nd Test match {{witnessed}} many controversial umpiring decisions {{from the}} two umpires - Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson and even the third Umpire. Three of Steve Bucknor's gaffes occurred {{when he did not}} give Andrew Symonds out caught behind at 30 when TV Replays clearly showed that the ball had passed through the bat's edge. The second one occurred when Bucknor did not refer a stumping call against Andrew Symonds to the third umpire. Replays showed the Australia all-rounder’s foot wasn't grounded inside the crease when the bails came off. This was a major boost for Australia as Symonds went on to make 162 not out and brought Australia back into the Game. After these incidents, Andrew Symonds said, [...] "I was very lucky. I was out when I was 30, given not out. That's cricket though, I can sit here and tell you about my bad decisions as well - but I won't." [...] On the fifth day, Bucknor declared Rahul Dravid out caught behind though television replays later showed the ball had brushed his pad without <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> bat.|$|E
2500|$|Beautiful Vision {{received}} acclaim {{from contemporary}} critics. In a review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau deemed it a musically cohesive album whose songs nonetheless all sound distinct, especially [...] "Cleaning Windows", {{which he said}} ranks among Morrison's greatest songs: [...] "This music is purely gorgeous (or at times lovely), its pleasure all formal grace and aptness of invention." [...] Chip Stern from High Fidelity believed even the inferior songs are a pleasure to listen to because of Morrison's maturation into a more relaxed and disciplined singer, while his band is eclectic yet subtle enough to incorporate a number of styles without sounding ostentatious: [...] "On tunes like 'Dweller on the Threshold', an r groove will suddenly support Celtic, Oriental, or Northern European folk references." [...] Rolling Stone magazine's John Milward was less enthusiastic and lamented four of the songs {{because of what he}} felt were unimaginative lyrics, instances [...] "when he lets his brain trivialize his heart" [...] on an album that is otherwise superior to the temporal, superficial nature of most popular music, [...] "a cogent statement of belief that finds Morrison <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> dangerously dogmatic themes with the grace of God".|$|E
