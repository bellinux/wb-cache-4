25|$|Amidst {{accelerating}} {{inflation in}} the United States, this unsustainable situation collapsed in May 1971, when West Germany {{was the first}} to withdraw support for the dollar and officially abandon the Bretton Woods accords, fueling a quick decline in <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar.</b> Under the pressure from currency speculation, Switzerland declared secession in August with $50 million in gold purchases, and France followed suit at the rate of $191 million. This brought the US gold reserves to their lowest level since 1938.|$|E

25|$|Mexico’s stockmarket {{is closely}} linked to {{developments}} in the US. Thus, volatility in the New York and Nasdaq stock exchanges, as well as interest-rate changes and economic expectations in the US, can steer the performance of Mexican equities. This is both because of Mexico’s economic dependence on the US and the high volume of trading in Mexican equities through American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Currently, the decline in <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> is making non-US markets, including Mexico's, more attractive.|$|E
25|$|The new Government {{was faced}} with an {{exchange}} rate crisis the day after it was elected. Speculators expected the change of government {{to result in a}} 20% devaluation of the New Zealand dollar, which led to the 1984 New Zealand constitutional crisis due to Muldoon's refusal to devalue, worsening the currency crisis further. As a result, the dollar was floated on 4 March 1985, allowing for <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> to change with the market. Prior to the dollar being floated, the dollar was pegged against a basket of currencies.|$|E
25|$|Since 76.7% of Canada's exports {{go to the}} U.S., and 53.3% {{of imports}} into Canada come from the U.S. Canadians are {{interested}} in the value of their currency mainly against the U.S. dollar. Although domestic concerns arise when the dollar trades much lower than its U.S. counterpart, there is also concern among exporters when the dollar appreciates quickly. A rise in <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> increases the price of Canadian exports to the U.S. On the other hand, there are advantages to a rising dollar, in that it is cheaper for Canadian industries to purchase foreign material and businesses.|$|E

25|$|U.S. {{currency}} does, however, bear several anti-counterfeiting features. Two of {{the most}} critical anti-counterfeiting features of U.S. currency are the paper and the ink. The composition of the paper is 75 percent cotton and 25 percent linen. The ink and paper combine to create a distinct texture, particularly as the currency is circulated. The paper and the ink alone have no effect on <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> until post print. These characteristics can be hard to duplicate without the proper equipment and materials. Furthermore, recent redesigns of the $5, $10, $20, and $50 notes have added EURion constellation patterns which can be used by scanning software to recognize banknotes and refuse to scan them.|$|E
25|$|From 1 January 1876 onwards, the Mark {{became the}} only legal tender. The name Goldmark was created later to {{distinguish}} it from the Papiermark (papermark) which suffered a serious loss of value through hyperinflation following World War I (see inflation in the Weimar Republic). The goldmark was on a gold standard with 2790 Mark equal to 1 kilogram of pure gold (1 Mark = 358mg). From 1900 to 1933, the United States adhered to a gold standard as well, with <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> being fixed at a price of approximately one-twentieth ounce (troy weight) of gold (one troy ounce of gold was actually valued at US$20.67). The goldmark therefore had a value of approximately U.S. $0.25. The monetary hegemon {{of the time when}} the goldmark was in use, however, was the Pound Sterling, with £1 being valued at 20.43 goldmarks.|$|E
25|$|Mandatory {{spending}} {{is expected to}} continue increasing as a share of GDP. This {{is due in part to}} demographic trends, as the number of workers continues declining relative to those receiving benefits. For example, the number of workers per retiree was 5.1 in 1960; this declined to 3.0 in 2010 and is projected to decline to 2.2 by 2030. These programs are also affected by per-person costs, which are also expected to increase at a rate significantly higher than economic growth. This unfavorable combination of demographics and per-capita rate increases is expected to drive both Social Security and Medicare into large deficits during the 21st century. Unless these long-term fiscal imbalances are addressed by reforms to these programs, raising taxes or drastic cuts in discretionary programs, the federal government will at some point be unable to pay its obligations without significant risk to <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> (inflation). By one estimate, 70% of the growth in these entitlement expenses over the 2016-2046 period is due to healthcare.|$|E

25|$|Prior to 1873, {{the silver}} dollar {{circulated}} {{in many parts}} of the world, with a value in relation to the British gold sovereign of roughly $1 = 4s 2d (21p approx). As a result of the decision of the German Empire to stop minting silver thaler coins in 1871, in the wake of the Franco-Prussian War, the worldwide price of silver began to fall. This resulted in the U.S. Coinage Act (1873) which put the United States onto a 'de facto' gold standard. Canada and Newfoundland were already on the gold standard, and the result was that <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> in North America increased in relation to silver dollars being used elsewhere, particularly Latin America and the Far East. By 1900, value of silver dollars had fallen to 50 percent of gold dollars. Following the abandonment of the gold standard by Canada in 1931, the Canadian dollar began to drift away from parity with the U.S. dollar. It returned to parity a few times, but since the end of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates that was agreed to in 1944, the Canadian dollar has been floating against the U.S. dollar. The silver dollars of Latin America and South East Asia began to diverge from each other as well during the course of the 20th century. The Straits dollar adopted a gold exchange standard in 1906 after it had been forced to rise in value against other silver dollars in the region. Hence, by 1935, when China and Hong Kong came off the silver standard, the Straits dollar was worth 2s 4d (11.5p approx) sterling, whereas the Hong Kong dollar was worth only 1s 3d sterling (6p approx).|$|E
500|$|Floyd Norris of The New York Times {{said the}} cause of the losses was rooted in the Plaza Accord that caused <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> to slide from 250 yen in 1984, to 121 yen by the end of 1987, heavily penalising Japanese exports.

2500|$|By mid October 2010, {{the dollar}} had dropped 7% since a 27 August speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke {{in which he}} said there was a {{possibility}} of further easing monetary policy. On 18 October, US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner stated [...] "It is very important for people to understand that the United States of America and no country around the world can devalue its way to prosperity and competitiveness." [...] Following this statement <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> rose as speculators calculated that {{at least in the short}} term it would be less likely for the US to intentionally devalue its currency.|$|E
2500|$|Under the Bretton Woods system {{established}} after World War II, {{the value}} of gold was fixed to $35 per ounce, and {{the value of}} the U.S. dollar was thus anchored to the value of gold. Rising government spending in the 1960s, however, led to doubts about the ability of the United States to maintain this convertibility, gold stocks dwindled as banks and international investors began to convert dollars to gold, and as a result <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> began to decline. Facing an emerging currency crisis and the imminent danger that the United States would {{no longer be able to}} redeem dollars for gold, gold convertibility was finally terminated in 1971 by President Nixon, resulting in the [...] "Nixon shock".|$|E

2500|$|The {{value of}} the U.S. dollar {{declined}} significantly during wartime, especially during the American Civil War, World War I, and World War II. The Federal Reserve, which was established in 1913, was designed to furnish an [...] "elastic" [...] currency subject to [...] "substantial changes of quantity over short periods", which differed significantly from previous forms of high-powered money such as gold, national bank notes, and silver coins. Over the very long run, the prior gold standard kept prices stable—for instance, the price level and the {{value of the}} U.S. dollar in 1914 was not very different from the price level in the 1880s. The Federal Reserve initially succeeded in maintaining the value of the U.S. dollar and price stability, reversing the inflation caused by the First World War and stabilizing <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> during the 1920s, before presiding over a 30% deflation in U.S. prices in the 1930s.|$|E
2500|$|On August 15, 1971, the United States {{unilaterally}} {{pulled out}} of the Bretton Woods Accord. The US abandoned the Gold Exchange Standard whereby <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> had been pegged to the price of gold and all other currencies were pegged to the dollar, whose value was left to [...] "float" [...] (rise and fall according to market demand). Shortly thereafter, Britain followed, floating the pound sterling. The other industrialized nations followed suit with their respective currencies. Anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time, the industrialized nations increased their reserves (by expanding their money supplies) in amounts far greater than before. The result was a depreciation of thedollar and other industrialized nations' currencies. Because oil was priced in dollars, oil producers' real income decreased. In September 1971, OPEC issued a joint communiqué stating that, from then on, they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold.|$|E
