This included thyroid ultrasound examination for all children in Fukushima. For appropriate evaluation of ultrasound screening of the thyroid, {{it is important to understand}} its reference data of thyroid findings in children in general. In order to analyze the frequencies of specific thyroid findings, we conducted ultrasound screening of the thyroid by the same procedures as used in Fukushima in 4, 365 children, aged 3 to 18 years, from three Japanese prefectures. Overall, thyroid cysts were identified in 56. 88 % <b>and</b> thyroid <b>nodules</b> in 1. 65 % of the participants. Thyroid cysts <b>and</b> <b>nodules</b> with a maximum diameter of more than 5 mm were identified in 4. 58 % and 1. 01 %, respectively, and age-adjusted prevalences were 3. 82 % and 0. 99 %, respectively.

40|$|Nodule {{nitrogen}} fixation rates are regulated by a mechanism which {{is responsive to}} the rhizosphere oxygen concentration. In some legumes, this oxygen-sensitive mechanism appears to involve changes in the gas permeability of a diffusion barrier in the nodule cortex. In soybean evidence for such a mechanism has not been found. The purpose {{of this research was}} to make quantitative measurements of soybean nodule gas permeability to test the hypothesis that soybean nodule gas permeability is under physiological control and responsive to the rhizosphere oxygen concentration. Intact hydroponically grown soybean plants were exposed to altered rhizosphere oxygen concentrations, <b>and</b> the <b>nodule</b> gas permeability, acetylene reduction <b>and</b> <b>nodule</b> respiration rates were repeatedly assayed. After a change in the external oxygen concentration, nitrogenase activity <b>and</b> <b>nodule</b> respiration rates displayed a short-term transient response after which the values returned to rates similar to those observed under ambient oxygen conditions. In contrast to steady-state nitrogenase activity <b>and</b> <b>nodule</b> respiration, nodule gas permeability was dramatically affected by the change in oxygen concentration. Decreasing the external oxygen concentration to 0. 1 cubic millimeter per cubic millimeter resulted in a mean increase in nodule gas permeability of 63 %. Increasing the rhizosphere oxygen concentration resulted in decreased nodule gas permeability. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that soybean nodules are capable of regulating {{nitrogen fixation}} <b>and</b> <b>nodule</b> respiration rates in response to changes in the rhizosphere oxygen concentration and indicate that the regulatory mechanism involves physiological control of the nodule gas permeability...|$|R

In severely Mo-deficient plants, shoot dry matter (DM) and shoot nitrogen (N) content were depressed. Molybdenum concentrations in plant parts increased with increasing Mo supply and were closely related to shoot N content. shoot DM, and seed DM. Critical Mo concentrations for diagnosis of hi 0 deficiency {{were obtained from the}} relationship between N content and &lo concentrations in leaves <b>and</b> <b>nodules.</b> <b>and</b> for prognosis of Mo deficiency were obtained from the relationship between seed yield and Mo concentrations in plant parts.

40|$|Soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr. cv Davis) {{was grown}} in a split-root growth system {{designed}} to maintain control of the root atmosphere.

A second experiment applied Ar:O 2 or air to the two sides of nodulated soybean half-root systems for 11 days in the following combinations: (a) Air to both sides (Air/Air); (b) Air to one side, Ar:O 2 to the other (Air/Ar:O 2), and (c) Ar:O 2 to both sides (Ar:O 2 /Ar:O 2). Results indicated that dry matter and current photosynthate (14 C) were selectively partitioned to <b>nodules</b> <b>and</b> roots where N 2 was available. Both root <b>and</b> <b>nodule</b> growth on the Air side of Air/Ar:O 2 plants was significantly greater than the Ar:O 2 side. The relative partitioning of carbon and current photosynthate between roots <b>and</b> <b>nodules</b> on a half-root system was also affected by N 2 availability. The Ar:O 2 sides partitioned relatively more current photosynthate to roots (57 %) than nodules (43 %), while N 2 -fixing root systems partitioned 36 and 64 % of the carbon to roots <b>and</b> <b>nodules,</b> respectively. The Ar:O 2 atmosphere decreased root <b>and</b> <b>nodule</b> respiration by 80 % and nitrogenase activity by 85 % compared to half-root systems in Air while specific nitrogenase activity of nodules in Ar:O 2 was 50 % of nodules supplied Air. Results indicated that nitrogen assimilation, whether from N 2 fixation or inorganic sources, had a localized effect on root development.
