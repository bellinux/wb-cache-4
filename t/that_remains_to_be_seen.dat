50|$|In {{a similar}} vein to packaging, {{electronic}} equipment and vehicles, the concept of extended producer responsibility was applied to Batteries in the UK through the transposition of the EU Battery Directive into UK legislation. The Directive required member states to have put regulations in place by 26 September 2008. Although the UK managed to introduce the single market requirements by that date, they failed to implement the collection and recycling requirements. Following a recent consultation, the government laid the new Regulations before Parliament on 16 April which will come into force on 5 May 2009. Responsibility for the financing of waste battery collection and treatment will be applied to producers from 1 January 2010 whilst retailers will have to offer free take back of portable batteries to consumers from 1 February 2010. The new Regulations have included some significant changes from the consultation. Only those that place more than one tonne per year onto the market will now have to register through Compliance Schemes and be required to finance collection etc. Those below a tonne will now have to register {{with one of the}} environmental Agencies for an annual fee of £30 creating a huge disparity between the two classes of producer as the larger ones are likely to have costs that will run into several thousands of pounds. The threshold for retail involvement has also changed, removing a 280m2 minimum floor space requirement but upping the total weight of batteries sold from 16 kg to 32 kg. This means that any retail premises selling more than approximately 24 AA batteries a week will be required to offer in-store take back. The requirements also apply to industrial and automotive batteries, but given the current value of those and their hazardous nature, there is little change to the current commercial processes that already see them all recovered anyway. The Directive requires member states to be collecting 25% of portable batteries by the end of 2012. The UK is believed to be collecting around 4%, so this is not without its challenges.

40|$|The {{first part}} of paper reviews the main {{economic}} features, factors and implications of the East Asian financial crises of 1997 - 1999. Two probable long-term implications are outlined: a reinforcement, contrary to the conventional wisdom, of the East Asian developmental and state-led model of capitalism; and an enhancement of the prospects for an “East Asian ” (as opposed to a “Pacific”) understanding of the region. The second part lists the distinctive features of East Asian regionalization (as an economic process) and regionalism (as a political project) up {{to the beginning of}} the crises. As closer economic ties between countries in the area have greatly expanded in the last decade, economic regionalization has proceeded in a much more dynamic fashion than regionalist projects. The latter have been restricted by their “informal ” character, e. g., their limitation to economic issues (and their focus on “open regionalism ” and sub-regional zones) and their strict respect, in inter-state relations, of non-interference. Finally, the third part is intended to suggest that the East Asian crises might perfectly reduce the speed of economic integration on a short- and medium-term basis and also bring about, among political leaders, a much reduced interest in the “open ” and informal regionalist project. If those trends will result in a “pure ” East Asian and more political regionalism is a question <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> and that is certainly open to debate...|$|E

It was reasoned that trade which economic integration would breed will create mutual interest which inhibits aggression and where goods were in circulation, weapons will fall silent. This thinking led to the formation of the United Nation (UN) with a view to ensuring world peace and to encourage the formation of regional economic institutions such as the European Union (EU) and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) including Latin America Free Trade Association (FTA) in 1960, Central America Common Market (CACM) in 1961, Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1967, The Caribbean Free Trade Association (CFTA) in 1968 and the Central African Economic Community (CAEC) in 19831. With regard to ECOWAS, the fundamental push for the formation of this regional economic community was the fact that trade relationship between nation states in the sub-region with European countries was a 'husband and spouse' arrangement. European countries were the husband while individual West African states were the spouse. The key feature of the husband and spouse arrangement was that trade between the husband and each spouse was naturally dominated by the husband to the detriment of the 'spouse' unless the 'spouse' work together to prevent this from happening. The formation of ECOWAS by the founding fathers was intended to give the different 'spouses' that constitute the Community the economic muscle that will thwart the dominance of the 'husband.

40|$|In {{the context}} of major socio-economic, {{technological}} and environmental changes from agricultural revolutions, mountainous areas are often considered favorable for biodiversity and agricultural practices that respect the environment. Yet these territories suffer a real human pressure through agriculture or forestry leading to fundamental issues of the coming century on the alteration of natural resources. Those new farming systems {{have led to the}} emergence or increase of abundance of species considering as agricultural pests. Due to food production losses, chemical control and damage to non-target wildlife, zoonosis tanks or as they represent key link of food webs, micro-mammals and their outbreaks represent a field of study of primary importance in ecology. Agricultural policies that led to a specialization in agricultural practices to grassland production have helped to foster the emergence of outbreaks of grassland voles (montane water vole and common vole) through increased vegetal production and homogenization of farming landscape in the Jura Mountains and Central Mountains. While some small predators such as weasels specialize in the consumption of these micro-mammals. Other predators, considered generalists, have a functional response by adapting their diet to the availability of the resource. This functional response can cause a diet switching on alternative prey to micro-mammals. Of all these species, small game species and endangered species are currently management issues and marked conservation. This thesis aims to compare two geographic areas (Alpine valley of the Haute-Romanche and the Jura Mountains) with a degree different from knowledge about grassland vole outbreak. We, through this work, compared the overgrowth phenomenon observed in Haute-Romanche with current knowledge of the Jura Mountains. We also have, through the analysis of long-term monitoring data and establishment of field experiments, tried to provide information about the relationship between prey and predators in a grassland vole outbreaking system in temperate environments. The objective is to attempt a comparison as possible between the two geographic areas to improve the management of these ecosystems. Our first task was to analyze the data collected between 1998 and 2010 to characterize the spatio-temporal variation of the montane water vole population in Haute-Romanche. We also faced this data to the agricultural history of the valley between 1810 and 2003 at the parcel scale. At first we found the similar agricultural historical scenario between the valley of the Haute-Romanche and other European mountainous areas with emphasis on grassland production, with direct effect as the virtual disappearance of the plowed areas, the cantonment of mowing areas in the valley bottoms and expansion of pasture areas. Based on these data, we were able to show a correlative link between the current land-use and the intensity of outbreaks of water vole. The grazing areas have presented a range of montane water vole abundance less important than mowed areas. The current agricultural land-use is directly dependent on the agricultural history of the valley, it appears likely that agricultural specialization towards grassland production in this valley is, as in the Jura Mountains, at the origin of the development of this episode of the montane water vole outbreak. Apart from the cyclical nature of the phenomenon <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> given its new appearance in this valley, there are great similarities with previous knowledge in the Jura Mountains and the Auvergne. Thus, the development of the outbreak at the parcel scale shows a process spread over about five years with at least one peak period and a period of decline and a period of low abundance. From a spatial point of view, the episode of outbreaks showed a spatial distribution {{in the form of a}} wave of colonization channeled through the relief, leaving the Northwest and then up the Romanche valley to the east. In the Doubs department, after taking into account time trend data and the impact of rodenticide treatments on our study area, it appears that there is a negative statistical relationship between the relative abundance of European hare and the red fox one. At the same time there is also a positive relationship between relative abundance of European hare and the montane water vole one. The latter can be considered as an indication of a potential diet switching of the red fox on the European hare. However this finding as a major present limits of never include diet analysis of red fox in the same period necessary to strengthen the hypothesis of diet switching of this species in particular. By working on the harvest of red fox faeces in Haute-Romanche, we observed that on fixed routes we harvested 4 - 5 times more faeces in autumn than in the summer and during the autumn faeces were located closer to inhabited areas. Regarding the latter observation, hypothesis proposed is the reduction or disappearance of summer food resources and the degradation of climatic conditions in altitude forcing red foxes to descend into the valley. We observed a high occurrence of insects (especially Orthoptera) in the diet of the fox. The montane water vole and voles of the genus Microtus are micro-mammals with the highest occurrence in red fox faeces. It seems that two types of food response exist for the red fox in our Alpine system. The first is characterized by opportunistic behavior of the red fox with increase in certain food resources simply linked to their seasonal availability. At the same time, when the montane water vole abundance decreases, the occurrence of other food items increases (fruits, meso or macro-mammals, indeterminate small mammals and Microtus spp.). It is difficult to conclude on diet switching of red fox on food resources presented above. Also on these two areas of study, we developed an experimental approach to predation by baiting camera traps. The predators observed are composed of 50 % by mammals dominated by red foxes and domestic animals (cats and dogs), 40 % by the predatory birds dominated by corvids and in 10 % of cases by non-identified predators. This device allowed us to see a lure survival difference depending on the type of predator. Thus predatory birds discover more quickly meat lures than most land predators (domestic cats with the same answer as avifauna). The categorization into two main types of landscape did not allow us to detect effects lure survival. Using an approach by satellite data analysis, we found a positive effect of the increase in plant biomass on the survival of meat lure advocating the assumption of a protective effect of plant density. However the explained variance seen little and we must remain cautious about this observation. The positive statistical relationship between the abundance of some predators (red fox, carrion crow, red kite) and montane water vole abundance advocate for considering a partial numerical response of predators via spatial mobility from an area overgrowth to another. This result is emerging as a new information in temperate systems like our mountainous areas. We have shown a positive relationship between survival of lure and relative abundance in montane water vole. This result is again an indication of the potential existence of a diet switching in our experiment. The renewal of this experiment in the Alpine valley of the Haute-Romanche brought us similar observations. This allowed us to strengthen our conclusions regarding the body of evidence arguing for a diet switching and therefore a functional response of predators. However, the low proportion of variance explained in each of our analyzes in the two areas questions the importance of the phenomenon in relation to other sources of variation in this kind of system with multiple food resources and many possible interactions. In terms of technical output, this finding therefore leads to a reflection on how to limit this potential diet switching on species whose conservation status is already weakened. One result is the possible presence of a positive effect qualifiable of "refuge" effect of plant biomass on lure survival. The conclusion of this thesis reinforces the idea that we must tackle the global problem of water vole at source by working on a landscape rediversification. Regarding predation, regulatory tools must be used after consultation with the various institutional bodies due to economic, ethical and health issues they raise. To strengthen field actions, the first action is the strengthening of observation systems for wildlife over the long term and over large spatial scales to measure the potential effects of corporate management actions. Dans le contexte des grands bouleversements socio-économiques, technologiques et environnementaux des révolutions agricoles, les zones de montagnes sont souvent considérées comme favorables à la biodiversité et à des pratiques agricoles respectueuses de l'environnement. Pourtant, ces territoires subissent une pression anthropique réelle via l'agriculture ou la sylviculture menant à une des questions fondamentales du siècle à venir sur l'altération des ressources naturelles pas les activités anthropiques. Ces nouveaux systèmes agricoles ont entraîné l'émergence ou l'augmentation d'abondance d'espèces devenues des pestes agricoles. En raison des pertes de productions alimentaires, de la lutte chimique et des dégâts sur la faune non-cible, des réservoirs de zoonoses qu’ils représentent ou comme maillon essentiel des réseaux trophiques, les micro-mammifères et leurs pullulations représentent un domaine d’étude de première importance en écologie. Les politiques agricoles qui ont mené à une spécialisation des pratiques agricoles vers la production herbagère ont contribué à favoriser l’apparition des pullulations de campagnols prairiaux (campagnol terrestre et campagnol des champs) via l’augmentation de la production végétale et une homogénéisation du paysage agricole dans le Massif Jurassien et le Massif Central. Tandis que certains prédateurs comme les petits mustélidés se spécialisent dans la consommation de ces micro-mammifères. D’autres prédateurs, considérés comme généralistes, présentent une réponse fonctionnelle alimentaire en adaptant leur alimentation à la disponibilité de la ressource. Cette réponse fonctionnelle peut être à l’origine d’un report de prédation sur des proies alternatives aux micro-mammifères. Parmi toutes ces espèces, la petite faune chassable et patrimoniale représente à l’heure actuelle des enjeux de gestion et de conservation marqués. Cette thèse a pour but de comparer deux zones géographiques (vallée alpine de la Haute-Romanche et Massif Jurassien) présentant un degré a priori différent de connaissances sur les systèmes de pullulations de campagnols prairiaux. Nous avons, au travers de ce travail, comparé le phénomène de pullulation observé en Haute-Romanche avec les connaissances actuelles du Massif Jurassien. Nous avons également, par l’analyse de données de monitoring à long terme et la mise en place d’expérimentations de terrain, essayé d’apporter des informations quant aux relations entre proies et prédateurs dans un système de pullulation de campagnol prairiaux en milieu tempéré. L’objectif est de tenter une comparaison tant que faire se peut entre les deux zones géographiques pour améliorer la gestion de ces écosystèmes. Notre premier travail fut d’analyser les données récoltées entre 1998 et 2010 pour caractériser le fonctionnement spatio-temporel du campagnol terrestre en Haute-Romanche. Nous avons également confronté ces données à l’histoire agricole de la vallée entre 1810 et 2003 à l’échelle parcellaire. Dans un premier temps, nous avons constaté que le scénario historique agricole était similaire entre cette vallée de la Haute-Romanche et d’autres zones montagnardes européennes, avec une spécialisation sur la production herbagère et comme effet direct la disparition virtuelle des zones labourées, le cantonnement des zones de fauches dans les fonds de vallée et l’extension des zones de pâtures au reste des zones exploitées pour l’agriculture. En se basant sur ces données, nous avons pu mettre en évidence un lien corrélatif à l’échelle parcellaire entre l’occupation du sol actuelle et l’intensité de la pullulation du campagnol terrestre. Les zones pâturées ont présenté une amplitude de l’abondance en campagnol terrestre moins importante que les zones fauchées. L’occupation agricole actuelle étant directement dépendant de l’histoire agricole de la vallée, il apparaît vraisemblable que la spécialisation agricole vers la production herbagère dans cette vallée est, comme dans le Jura, à l’origine du développement de cet épisode de pullulation du campagnol terrestre. Hormis la cyclicité du phénomène, qui reste à observer compte tenu de son aspect nouveau dans cette vallée, il existe de grandes similitudes avec les connaissances déjà acquises dans le Massif du Jura et en Auvergne. Ainsi, le développement de la pullulation à l’échelle parcellaire montre un processus étalé sur environ 5 années, avec au moins une période de pic puis un période de déclin et une période de faible abondance. D’un point de vue spatial, l’épisode de pullulation a montré une diffusion spatiale sous la forme d’une vague de colonisation canalisée par le relief, partant du Nord-Ouest puis remontant la vallée de la Romanche vers l’Est. Dans le département du Doubs, après avoir tenu compte des tendances temporelles des données et de l’impact des traitements rodenticides sur notre zone d’étude, il apparait qu’il existe une relation statistique négative entre l’abondance relative du lièvre d’Europe et celle du renard roux. Dans le même 12 temps, il existe également une relation positive entre l’abondance relative en lièvre d’Europe et celle du campagnol terrestre. Cette dernière peut être considérée comme une indication d’un potentiel report de prédation du renard roux sur le lièvre d’Europe. Néanmoins cette conclusion présente comme limite majeur, le fait de ne jamais inclure d’analyse de régime alimentaire du renard roux durant la même période, nécessaire pour renforcer l’hypothèse du report de prédation de cette espèce en particulier. En travaillant sur la récolte de fèces de renard roux en Haute-Romanche, nous avons observé que, sur des parcours fixes, nous récoltions 4 à 5 fois plus de fèces en automne qu’en été et que, durant l’automne, les fèces étaient situées plus près des zones habitées. Concernant cette dernière observation, l’hypothèse proposée est la diminution ou la disparition de ressources alimentaires estivales et la dégradation des conditions climatiques en altitude forçant les renards roux à redescendre dans la vallée. Nous avons observé une forte occurrence d’insectes (et notamment d’orthoptères) dans le régime alimentaire du renard. Le campagnol terrestre et les campagnols du genre Microtus représente les micro-mammifères à l’occurrence la plus élevée dans les fèces de renard roux. Il semble que deux types de réponse alimentaire existent pour le renard roux dans notre système Alpin. Le premier est caractérisé par un comportement opportuniste du renard roux avec l’augmentation commune de certaines ressources alimentaires simplement en lien avec leur disponibilité saisonnière. Dans le même temps, lorsque l'abondance en campagnol terrestre diminue, l’occurrence d’autres items alimentaires augmente (fruits, méso ou macro-mammifères indéterminés, petits mammifères indéterminés et Microtus spp.). Il apparaît difficile de conclure à un report de prédation du renard roux sur les ressources alimentaires présentées ci-dessus. Toujours sur ces deux zones d’études, nous avons développé une approche expérimentale de la prédation par ajout et surveillance photographique d’une nouvelle « proie » (un leurre carné). La guilde observée des prédateurs est composée à 50 % par des mammifères dominés par le renard roux et les animaux domestiques (chat et chien), à 40 % par l’avifaune prédatrice dominée par les corvidés et dans 10 % des cas par des prédateurs non identifiés. Ce dispositif nous a permis de constater une différence de vitesse de découverte du leurre carné en fonction du type de prédateur. Ainsi l’avifaune prédatrice découvre plus rapidement les leurres carnés que la plupart des prédateurs terrestres (le chat domestique présentant la même réponse que l’avifaune). La catégorisation en deux grandes typologies du paysage n’as pas permis de détecter d’effets de ce dernier sur la consommation du leurre. En utilisant une approche par analyses de données satellitaires, nous avons détecté un effet positif de l’augmentation de biomasse végétale sur la survie du leurre carné plaidant pour l’hypothèse d’un effet protecteur de la densité végétale. Néanmoins au vu de la faible part de variance expliquée par notre approche nous nous devons de rester prudents quant à cette observation. La relation statistique positive entre l’abondance de certains prédateurs (renard roux, corneille noire, milan royal) et l’abondance en campagnol terrestre que nous observons nous permet d’envisager une réponse numérique partielle des prédateurs via une mobilité spatiale d’une zone de pullulation à une autre. Ce résultat s’affirme comme une information nouvelle dans des systèmes tempérés tels que nos zones de moyennes montagnes. Nous avons montré une relation positive entre la survie du leurre carné et l’abondance relative en campagnol terrestre. Ce résultat représente à nouveau une indication de l’existence potentielle d’un report de prédation dans notre expérimentation. La reconduction de ce dispositif dans la vallée alpine de la Haute-Romanche nous a apporté des observations similaires. Ceci nous a permis de renforcer nos conclusions concernant le faisceau d’indices plaidant en faveur d’un report de prédation et donc d’une réponse fonctionnelle des prédateurs. Cependant, la faible part de variance expliquée dans chacune de nos analyses dans les deux zones d’études met en question l’importance du phénomène en regard des autres sources de variations dans ce type de système à multiples ressources alimentaires et nombreuses interactions possibles. En matière d’apport technique, ce constat amène donc à une réflexion à engager sur les moyens à mettre en œuvre pour limiter ce report de prédation potentiel sur des espèces dont le statut de conservation est déjà fragilisé. Un des résultats est la présence possible d’un effet positif qualifiable « d’effet refuge » de la biomasse végétale sur le temps de découverte des leurres carnés. La conclusion de cette thèse renforce l’idée qu’il faut attaquer la problématique globale du campagnol terrestre à la source en travaillant sur une rediversification paysagère. Concernant la prédation, les outils de régulation doivent être utilisés après concertation avec les différents organismes institutionnels en raison des questions économiques, éthiques et sanitaires qu’ils soulèvent. Pour renforcer les actions de terrain, la première des actions est le renforcement des systèmes d’observations de la faune sauvage sur le long terme et sur de larges échelles spatiales pour mesurer les effets potentiels des actions de gestion entreprises...|$|E
