It's in Hawaii, right? I can do that!'" [...] Cuse later commented, [...] "He's quite a good actor. People only <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> the doobie-smoking '70s dude. But he played Tyne Daly's love interest in Judging Amy. C'mon!" ...|$|E

500|$|While in high school, Garland {{also played}} Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) {{basketball}} with the Philly Pride. Amauro Austin, a statistician for the Philadelphia Daily News, directed the program while Garland was there. Austin commented, [...] "Everybody liked Ty. Not one person didn't. He was loyal, honest; just a solid-gold individual. He didn't have a malicious {{bone in his}} body". Garland often slept {{during the day and}} stayed awake at night, leading his peers to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a vampire. Before becoming a senior, he led the Pride to sixth place at the under-17 national AAU tournament in Orlando, Florida. The team finished with an 8–1 record due largely to Garland's contributions.|$|E

He {{fell into a}} coma and died at 4:35a.m. PDT on June 28, 1981, with his family by his side. The Government of Canada ordered flags across the country lowered to half mast, an unprecedented honour that was usually reserved for statesmen. Addressing the House of Commons, Trudeau said, [...] "It occurs very rarely {{in the life of}} a nation that the courageous spirit of one person unites all people in the celebration of his life and in the mourning of his death ... We do not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> one who was defeated by misfortune but as one who inspired us with the example of the triumph of the human spirit over adversity".|$|E

She finally realizes that he had been taking advantage of her, but is able to trace Big Mary and Clyde to Bakersfield, California, and has an emotional reunion with her son. She writes, [...] "In the plowed farmyard near Bakersfield, I began to understand that uniqueness of the person. He was three and I was nineteen, and never again would I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a beautiful appendage of myself".|$|E

500|$|As {{with the}} pilot, [...] "The Thing You Love Most" [...] was co-written by series co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Smallville co-executive {{producer}} Greg Beeman served as director. The episode {{focuses on the}} rivalry between Emma and Regina, as each believes they know {{what is best for}} Henry. In an interview with TV Overmind, actress Lana Parrilla explained that viewers would see a [...] "vulnerable" [...] side of Regina/The Evil Queen in this episode. Says Parrilla, [...] "What I’ve been trying to show is not the hatred for Snow White, but where it derives from. It’s not so surfaced. That brings a vulnerability to the character. You’ll see into her history and that exposes her in a very vulnerable way as well." [...] As for Regina's troubled relationship with Henry, Parrilla noted that [...] "she may have a cold heart, but I think she really, genuinely loves her son. She doesn’t <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> an adopted son, she thinks of him as her son." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} at Somerset, he was known for [...] " [...] a match with his {{cracking}} strokes in an hour." [...] Alan Gibson wrote: [...] "We hardly <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a stylist, and he was mostly a back-foot player, getting the greater number of his runs in the segments fanning out from point and square-leg. But he was enjoyable to watch, compact, tidy, combining powerful hitting with delicate placing. In the best Somerset tradition, he was always after the bowling, and in the best Australian tradition, he always relished a fight." [...] But he also adapted his style to suit English pitches: in an early innings for Somerset, he was out trying to hook a ball from Trevor Bailey. [...] "The hook, he decided, was a stroke to be used sparingly on English pitches... McCool was constantly amending his technique that season , whenever he spotted a flaw in his method. Again and again he held the Somerset batting together. Nothing in his previous experience had equipped him for the task of holding up a losing side in a damp English summer." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1802, Cavendish's cousin John Ponsonby, Viscount Duncannon (her mother's sister's son), {{whom she}} had known her entire life, began to show romantic {{interest}} in her. Cavendish was unsure whether she cared for him enough, and they agreed to wait a year before deciding [...] "whether they liked each other well enough to marry". Their two families, especially his mother (and her aunt) Lady Bessborough approved of the match, but Cavendish was still undecided. During this period, John had romantic relationships with Lady Maria Fane and others; Cavendish presented an ultimatum that he [...] "must promise to cure himself completely of flirting, for she could not bear it". John angrily refused {{that he was not}} ready to marry her after all, nor [...] "bear rules to be prescribed to him by any woman living". He became engaged to Fane shortly thereafter. Her family later encouraged a match with another cousin John Spencer, Viscount Althorp, though, during her stay at Althorp, she stated that [...] "no reasonable woman" [...] could <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> anything [...] "but as an eager huntsman".|$|E

500|$|Musial was {{assigned}} to the Class AA Columbus Red Birds to begin 1941, though manager, Burt Shotton, and Musial himself quickly realized that the previous year's injury had considerably weakened his arm. He was reassigned to the Class C Springfield Cardinals as a full-time outfielder, and he later credited manager Ollie Vanek for displaying confidence in his hitting ability. During 87 games with Springfield, Musial hit a league-leading [...]379 before being promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. He was noted for his unique batting stance, a crouch in which his back was seemingly square to the pitcher. This stance was later described by pitcher Ted Lyons as [...] "a kid peeking around the corner to see if the cops were coming". According to a 1950 description by author Tom Meany, [...] "The bent knees and the crouch give him the appearance of a coiled spring, although most pitchers <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a coiled rattlesnake." [...] Musial continued to play well in Rochester—in one three-game stretch, he had 11 hits. He was called up to the Cardinals for the last two weeks of the 1941 season.|$|E
500|$|Despite being heavily {{associated}} with firearms in his Westerns and police movies, Eastwood has publicly endorsed gun control {{since at least}} 1973. In the April 24, 1973, edition of The Washington Post, the star said, [...] "I'm for gun legislation myself. I don't hunt." [...] Two years later, in 1975, Eastwood told People magazine that he favors [...] "gun control to some degree." [...] About a year later, Eastwood remarked that [...] "All guns should be registered. I don't think legitimate gun owners would mind that kind of legislation. Right now the furor against a gun law is by gun owners who are overreacting. They're worried that all guns {{are going to be}} recalled. It's impossible to take guns out of circulation, and that's why firearms should be registered and mail-order delivery of guns halted." [...] In 1993, he noted that he [...] "...was always a backer" [...] of the Brady Bill, with its federally mandated waiting period. In 1995, Eastwood questioned the purpose of assault weapons. Larry King, the television host and newspaper columnist, wrote in the May 22, 1995, edition of USA Today that [...] "my interview with Eastwood will air on 'Larry King Weekend'... I asked him his thoughts on the NRA and gun control and he said that while people <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> pro-gun, he has always been in favor of controls. 'Why would anyone need or want an assault weapon?' he said." ...|$|E

2500|$|A dark warrior strong {{with the}} Force, {{originally}} {{a member of}} the Knights of Ren, and a high ranking member of the First Order. He is the son of Han and Leia.

He's more dangerous and unpredictable, and morally justified in doing what he thinks is right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Theodore Drange, in {{his attempt}} to improve the {{argument}} (see below), states that there are many theists who do not view God as perfectly loving, and [...] "some Christians <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> an angry deity bent on punishing people for their sins." [...] Drange concludes that the argument should be put forward only in relation to theists who already accept the first premise and believe in a god who is perfectly loving.|$|E
2500|$|In Superman/Batman #3 (Dec. 2003), Batman, under writer Jeph Loeb, observes, [...] "It is a {{remarkable}} dichotomy. In many ways, Clark is the most human of us all. Then... he shoots fire from the skies, {{and it is difficult}} not to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a god. And how fortunate we all are that it does not occur to 'him'." [...] In writer Geoff Johns' Infinite Crisis #1 (Dec. 2005), part of the 2005–2006 [...] "Infinite Crisis" [...] crossover storyline, Batman admonishes him for identifying with humanity too much and failing to provide the strong leadership that superhumans need.|$|E

He has not made any appearances beyond season one. As of episode 23, [...] "The Titan on the Tracks", he is said to be on sabbatical, and is never seen for the rest of the series.|$|E
2500|$|Dukat {{played a}} {{versatile}} role throughout the series and {{was often a}} nuanced character. In the words of Deep Space Nine co-executive producer Ronald D. Moore, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> being completely evil through and through ... He can be charming. He can be generous. He can do the right thing. All of that somehow makes his 'evil' actions all the more despicable, {{because we know that}} there was the potential in there for him to be a better person." [...] Ultimately, despite the character's versatility, [...] "Dukat is a bad guy. A very bad guy." [...] Indeed, StarTrek.com describes him as [...] "the most complex and fully developed villain in Star Trek history".|$|E
