5|$|Keynes's {{optimism}} {{was also}} cultural, in two senses: {{he was of}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>generation</b> raised by an empire still {{at the height of}} its power, and was also of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>generation</b> who felt entitled to govern by culture, rather than by expertise. According to Skidelsky, the sense of cultural unity current in Britain from the 19th century to the end of World War I provided a framework with which the well-educated could set various spheres of knowledge in relation {{to each other and to}} life, enabling them to confidently draw from different fields when addressing practical problems.|$|E

25|$|Roly Jenkins (sometimes spelt Roley) (24 November 1918 – 22 July 1995) was an English cricketer, almost {{exclusively}} for Worcestershire as a leg spinner {{in the period}} immediately after World War II.

25|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, Forest Hills {{was home}} to working-class laborers on the streets {{adjacent}} to the train station, and middle-class managers and professionals to the south, with neither public housing nor areas of affluence.

He uses simple, lyrical language and is mostly inspired by the political atmosphere.

25|$|The domes of the Safavid dynasty (1501–1732) are {{characterized}} by a distinctive bulbous profile and are considered <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>generation</b> of Persian domes. They are generally thinner than earlier domes and are decorated {{with a variety of}} colored glazed tiles and complex vegetal patterns, and they were influential on those of other Islamic styles, such as the Mughal architecture of India. An exaggerated style of onion dome on a short drum, as can be seen at the Shah Cheragh (1852–1853), first appeared in the Qajar period. Domes have remained important in modern mausoleums, and domed cisterns and icehouses remain common sights in the countryside.|$|E

CP/M 3 could therefore use more than 64 kB of memory on an 8080 or Z80 processor. The {{system could be}} configured to support date stamping of files.

25|$|Schneerson {{would finish}} almost every public talk of his {{with a prayer}} for the {{imminent}} arrival of the Messiah. As early as the 1970s, he sought {{to raise awareness of}} the Messianic age by encouraging people to learn and become knowledgeable in the laws of the Holy Temple, laws that will only apply when the Messiah actually comes. In this connection, he quoted from earlier rabbinic opinion that learning about the redemption would raise awareness of and could actually bring the Messiah sooner. Rabbi Schneerson would frequently quote the many sages who stated that this generation was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>generation</b> of the exile and would be the first generation of redemption and would quote the Chafetz Chaim and others, who stated that actively asking for the Messiah's coming is crucial.|$|E

He wanted to change that pattern with Sunset Overdrive by encouraging players to attack in an aggressive manner and to focus on momentum.

500|$|Think {{of a gene}} {{with two}} alleles, A or B. In diploid populations {{consisting}} of N individuals there are 2N copies of each gene. An individual can have two copies of the same allele or two different alleles. We can call the frequency of one allele p {{and the frequency of}} the other q. The Wright–Fisher model (named after Sewall Wright and Ronald Fisher) assumes that generations do not overlap (for example, annual plants have exactly one generation per year) and that each copy of the gene found in the new generation is drawn independently at random from all copies of the gene in the old generation.

500|$|Functioning as the Senate's {{presiding}} officer, Breckinridge's {{participation in}} the chamber's debates was also restricted, but he won respect for presiding [...] "gracefully and impartially." [...] On January 4, 1859, {{he was asked to}} deliver the final address in the Old Senate Chamber; in the speech, he expressed his desire that the Congress find a solution that would preserve the Union. During its half century in the chamber, the Senate had grown from 32 to 64 members. During those years, he observed, the Constitution had [...] "survived peace and war, prosperity and adversity" [...] to protect [...] "the larger personal freedom compatible with public order." [...] Breckinridge expressed hope that eventually [...] "another Senate, in another age, shall bear to a new and larger Chamber, this Constitution vigorous and inviolate, and that <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>generation</b> of posterity shall witness the deliberations of the Representatives of American States, still united, prosperous, and free." [...] Breckinridge then led a procession to the new chamber. Breckinridge opposed the idea that the federal government could coerce action by a state, but maintained that secession, while legal, was not the solution to the country's problems.|$|E
