5|$|Defences to tracing are possible, {{particularly}} if returning the property would harm an innocent defendant, where the claimant has made false representations <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> relied {{on to his}} detriment, or where the property has been transferred to an innocent third party without anything given to the defendant in return that the claimant could recover in lieu.|$|E
5|$|Proof of {{specific}} intent to endanger life is unnecessary {{on a charge}} of attempting this offence. In Attorney General's Reference No. 3 of 1992 (1994), {{on a charge of}} attempted aggravated arson, it was held to be sufficient for the prosecution to establish a specific intent to cause damage by fire and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> was reckless as to whether life would thereby be endangered.|$|E
5|$|Lower {{courts are}} split {{on whether the}} Clause {{requires}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> be tried in a judicial district that was in existence {{at the time the}} crime was committed. Some courts have held that it does. Others have held that it does not and that the district need only be ascertained prior to trial. Even proponents of the former view have found no infirmity when Congress prospectively divides a judicial district, but retains the former configuration for past offenses.|$|E
50|$|The Court of Appeal ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> {{could not}} rely on the {{doctrine}} of frustration and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> would have to bear the additional costs of transporting the rig.|$|R
50|$|District Attorney Hoyt {{starts his}} opening {{statement}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> have ignored their Good Samaritan Law and mocked {{the victim of a}} mugging. He also states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> must pay for this crime. Jackie Chiles starts {{his opening statement}} that this trial is a waste of the taxpayer's money, <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> are innocent from bystanding, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> real criminal is still out there.|$|R

5|$|One of Gheorghe Tătărescu's last {{appearances}} in public was his stand {{as one of}} the prosecution's witnesses in the 1954 trial of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, when he claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> had been infiltrated into the PCR during the time when he had been premier (Pătrășcanu was posthumously cleared of all charges). Released in 1955, Tătărescu died in Bucharest, less than two years later. According to Sanda Tătărescu Negropontes, this came as a result of tuberculosis contracted while in detention.|$|E
5|$|The Bill of Middlesex was a {{legal fiction}} {{used by the}} Court of King's Bench to gain {{jurisdiction}} over cases traditionally in the remit of the Court of Common Pleas. Hinging on the King's Bench's remaining criminal jurisdiction over the county of Middlesex, the Bill allowed it to take cases traditionally in the remit of other common law courts by claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> had committed trespass in Middlesex. Once the defendant was in custody, the trespass complaint would be quietly dropped and other complaints (such as debt or detinue) would be substituted.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be a {{reluctance}} to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that he feels {{it was not necessary}} to delve into the validity of the conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E
25|$|The {{plaintiff}} {{must then}} be afforded a fair opportunity to present facts to show an inference of discrimination. The plaintiff may do so either by showing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> explanation is insufficient {{and only a}} pretext for discrimination or by otherwise proving <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> actions used one of the listed unlawful discriminatory parameters.|$|R
50|$|Rule 8(c) {{requires}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> answer {{must state}} any affirmative defenses.|$|R

5|$|Under {{the current}} law {{there are two}} {{applications}} of the insanity defence; where it is claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> was insane {{at the time that}} he committed the crime, and where it is claimed that he was insane at the time of the trial and thus unable to effectively defend himself. The defence is most commonly used in the Crown Court, since it was previously believed that it required a jury; in DPP v Harper , it was decided that the defence could also be applied in the Magistrates' Court.|$|E
5|$|On May 24, Judge Singleterry heard {{arguments}} from the plaintiff {{and the defense}} on the request for the change of venue. On June 7, he denied {{a request for a}} change of venue after considering <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> failed to prove that there was prejudice against him in the Hidalgo community. On July 19, Feit appeared in court for a prehearing. The trial was expected to place on September 11. However, on September 10, the court decided to push the trial due to scheduling conflicts with one of the attorneys and because of delays in another high-profile case in the Hidalgo County. Feit appeared in court on September 11 – for the first time without prison uniform – expecting to face trial that week. The initial phase of jury selection was done in mid-September; the trial was pushed for mid-October.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{specific}} rules {{that apply to}} acts or omissions in homicide: an omission is criminal if the defendant fails to prevent the avoidable death of the victim {{where he or she}} has the duty to do so and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> had the capacity to do so. As noted below, unlawful omissions have been excluded from unlawful act manslaughter. Like in other areas, a duty of care may now be owed, following R. v Evans, even where the dangerous situation which results in the victim's death was not caused by the defendant. Medical professionals may be relieved of their responsibility to sustain a patient's life, where terminating life support is dubiously legally classified as an omission.|$|E
2500|$|The case {{then went}} to the Exchequer of Pleas, where it was heard between 3 and 5 May 1865. It was heard on two points. Firstly, whether <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> were liable for the actions of the {{contractors}} and secondly, whether <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> were liable for the damage regardless of their lack of negligence. They decided for <b>the</b> first point <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> were not liable, but more split on the second point. Pollock CB, Martin B and Channell B held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> were not liable, as since a negligence claim could not be brought there was no valid case. Bramwell B, dissenting, argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> claimant had the right to enjoy his land free of interference from water, and that as a result <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> was guilty of trespass and the commissioning of a nuisance. He stated that [...] "the general law in matters wholly independent of contract" [...] should be <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> were liable, [...] "on <b>the</b> plain ground <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> have caused water to flow into the 's mines, which but for <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> act would not have gone there".|$|R
5000|$|The Supreme Court {{concluded}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> purposefully availed {{themselves of}} the protections of the forum state (Florida) and were, therefore, subject to jurisdiction there. <b>The</b> Court reasoned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> had a [...] "substantial and continuing" [...] relationship with Burger King in Florida and that due process would not be violated because <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> should have reasonably anticipated being summoned into court in Florida for breach of contract.|$|R
50|$|For example: {{a witness}} who testifies <b>that</b> he saw <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> shoot <b>the</b> victim gives direct evidence. A witness who testifies <b>that</b> he saw <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> fleeing <b>the</b> scene of the crime, or a {{forensics}} expert who says that ballistics proves <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> gun shot <b>the</b> bullet <b>that</b> killed <b>the</b> victim both give circumstantial evidence from which <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> guilt may be inferred.|$|R
5|$|Whether counsel are {{appointed}} or retained, the Clause protects {{the role of}} counsel and certain attributes of the attorney-client relationship. For example, the Clause requires <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> be given time to consult with counsel and that counsel be given time to investigate the case pre-trial. And, the Clause also prohibits a state from barring a defendant from being cross-examined by counsel, or restricting {{the order in which}} the defendant may be called as a witness. Further, the court may not prevent a defendant from consulting with her counsel during an overnight recess, even if the recess bisects direct- and cross-examination of the defendant. Similarly, the defendant has a right to have her counsel make a closing argument, even if a bench trial.|$|E
25|$|In a {{conversion}} suit, {{it is no}} defense to claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> was not negligent or <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> acquired the plaintiff's property through the plaintiff's unilateral mistake, or <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> acted in complete innocence and perfect good faith.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court {{reiterated that}} {{a finding of}} willfulness in a federal {{criminal}} tax case requires proof (1) that the law imposed a duty on the defendant, (2) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> knew of this duty, and (3) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> voluntarily and intentionally violated that duty. In explaining how the willfulness element must be proven, the Court distinguished arguments about constitutionality of the tax law from statutory arguments about the tax law.|$|E

25|$|Miranda v. Arizona, , was a {{landmark}} {{decision of the}} United States Supreme Court. In a 5–4 majority, the Court held that both inculpatory and exculpatory statements made in response to interrogation by a defendant in police custody will be admissible at trial only if the prosecution can show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> was informed {{of the right to}} consult with an attorney before and during questioning and of the right against self-incrimination before police questioning, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> not only understood these rights, but voluntarily waived them.|$|E
25|$|Justice Roberts's dissent also {{acknowledges}} the racism {{inherent in the}} case although he does not use the word. He recognized <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> was being punished based solely upon his ancestry.|$|E

25|$|Nominal damages {{consist of}} a small cash amount where the court concludes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> is in breach but the {{plaintiff}} has suffered no quantifiable pecuniary loss, and may be sought to obtain a legal record of who was at fault.|$|E
25|$|Importantly, {{the court}} held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> need not provide proof that this {{particular}} application of the seniority system should prevail and that once the defendant showed that the accommodation violated the seniority system it fell to Barnett to show it was nevertheless reasonable.|$|E
25|$|As noted, {{information}} obtained {{in violation of}} the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel is subject to suppression unless the government can establish <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> waived his right to counsel. The waiver must be knowing, intelligent and voluntary. A valid Miranda waiver operates as a waiver of Sixth Amendment right.|$|E
5000|$|... "Between {{the months}} of June and August, the Plaintiff {{repeatedly}} complained to members of <b>the</b> <b>Defendant's</b> family <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Defendant's</b> family's dogs were trespassing on his property." ...|$|R
25|$|On August 21, 2008, in U.S. v. Craighead, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> rights {{had been}} {{violated}} {{when he was}} interrogated {{in his own home}} without first being read his Miranda rights. In that case, numerous law enforcement officers had arrived at <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> home because he was suspected of having downloaded child pornography. In a decision written by Bybee, <b>the</b> Court held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> interrogation had been custodial and therefore violated his Fifth Amendment rights.|$|R
