5|$|In {{the poem}} Alvíssmál, Thor tricks a dwarf, Alvíss, to his doom upon finding that {{he seeks to}} wed his {{daughter}} (unnamed, possibly Þrúðr). As the poem starts, Thor meets a dwarf who talks about getting married. Thor finds <b>the</b> <b>dwarf</b> repulsive and, apparently, realizes that the bride is his daughter. Thor comments that the wedding agreement was made among the gods while Thor was gone, and that <b>the</b> <b>dwarf</b> must seek his consent. To do so, Thor says, Alvíss must tell him {{what he wants to}} know about all of the worlds that <b>the</b> <b>dwarf</b> has visited. In a long question and answer session, Alvíss does exactly that; he describes natural features as they are known in the languages of various races of beings in the world, and gives an amount of cosmological lore.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dwarves</b> {{are said}} to have been created by the Vala Aulë, who offered to destroy them when Ilúvatar confronted him. <b>The</b> seven <b>Dwarf</b> Fathers had no true life as created by Aulë, but were tied to his power. When Ilúvatar saw that Aulë had created <b>the</b> <b>Dwarves</b> in an desire to see Ilúvatar's vision {{fulfilled}} and not out of a desire for power or domination of Aulë's will, Ilúvatar brought true life to <b>the</b> seven <b>Dwarf</b> fathers. He forgave Aulë's transgression and adopted <b>the</b> <b>Dwarves</b> as his own. His only condition was that they were not allowed to awaken before the Elves. Therefore, the Dwarves' creator Aulë laid them to sleep in hidden mountain locations until the Elves awoke. These dwarves were known as the Seven Fathers of <b>the</b> <b>Dwarves,</b> who (along with their mates) went on to found the seven kindreds of Dwarves when they awoke. <b>The</b> first <b>dwarf</b> to awake was Durin the father of the Longbeards, the oldest and wisest kindred of <b>the</b> <b>Dwarves,</b> and <b>the</b> main focus of Tolkien's stories. Durin founded <b>the</b> greatest <b>Dwarf</b> kingdom called Khazad-dûm, later known as Moria in the Misty Mountains. <b>The</b> <b>Dwarves</b> spread throughout northern Endor and each kindred founded its own kingdom. Only two other of these kingdoms are mentioned by Tolkien, Nogrod and Belegost in the Ered Luin or Blue Mountains. These were the home of the Firebeards and the Broadbeams, who were allies of the Elves of Beleriand against Morgoth in the First Age. The language spoken by <b>the</b> <b>Dwarves</b> is called Khuzdul, and was kept largely as a secret language for their own use. <b>The</b> <b>dwarves</b> are mortal like Men, but live much longer, usually several hundred years. A peculiarity of Dwarves is that both males and females are bearded, and thus appear identical to outsiders.|$|R
5|$|The mounded prairie {{region is}} located {{on top of the}} plateaus, {{characterized}} by many species grasses and wildflowers around the vernal pools, with mounds of soil created by erosion. <b>The</b> <b>dwarf</b> woolly meadowfoam, a plant endemic to the Table Rocks, grows near these pools. They bloom for about ten days in April. When filled in the winter and early spring, the pools are also a known habitat for the vernal pool fairy shrimp (Branchinecta lynchi), a threatened species.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{component of the}} Solar System is the Sun, a G2 main-sequence star that contains 99.86% of the system's known mass and dominates it gravitationally. The Sun's four largest orbiting bodies, the giant planets, account for 99% of the remaining mass, with Jupiter and Saturn together comprising more than 90%. The remaining objects of the Solar System (including the four terrestrial planets, <b>the</b> <b>dwarf</b> planets, moons, asteroids, and comets) together comprise less than 0.002% of the Solar System's total mass.|$|E

5|$|A further {{internal}} diagonal {{passes through}} the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female dwarf and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are more visible than those of <b>the</b> <b>dwarf</b> who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on to the viewer, draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of dark hair, {{the light on the}} hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of light on the artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.|$|E

5|$|Basil cultivars vary {{in several}} ways. Visually, {{the size and}} shape of the leaves varies greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the Mammoth basil and Lettuce leaf basil to the tiny leaves of <b>the</b> <b>Dwarf</b> bush basil.

The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.|$|E
