5|$|A {{moderate}} leader, {{he worked}} fruitlessly alongside William Abraham {{to resolve the}} 1910–11 Cambrian Combine dispute, after {{the two men were}} shunned by <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> miners' leaders. Although espousing Gladstonian Liberalism and opposing the affiliation of The Miners' Federation of Great Britain to the Labour Party, Watts Morgan joined <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> and Marxist Plebs' League and sat on the board of governors for the Central Labour College.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} Díaz {{tried to come}} to terms with Madero, {{particularly}} after the capture of Cuautla by the Zapatistas in south-central Mexico. Together with his finance minister and main advisor, José Yves Limantour, Díaz planned to make concessions to the fairly moderate Madero and, once Madero was pacified, crack down hard on <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> elements among the rebels. A truce was agreed to on April 23.|$|E
5|$|A {{group in}} Cambridge, which {{met at the}} White Horse tavern from the mid-1520s and became known as Little Germany, soon became influential. Its members {{included}} Robert Barnes, Hugh Latimer, John Frith and Thomas Bilney—all eventually burned as heretics. Cranmer's change of mind, borne partly by his membership of the team negotiating for the annulment, finally came through his stay with Andreas Osiander in Nuremberg in 1532. (Cranmer also secretly married Osiander's niece). Even then the position was {{complicated by the fact}} that Lutherans were not in favour of the annulment. Cranmer (and Henry) felt obliged to seek assistance from Strasbourg and Basel, which brought him into contact with <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> ideas associated with Zwingli.|$|E
50|$|He was {{associated}} with his fellow Briton Pelagius, although Pelagius distanced himself from <b>the</b> Sicilian Briton's <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> doctrines.|$|R
50|$|A right-wing critic like G. Edward Griffin, {{faced with}} <b>the</b> movement's <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> claims to promote social change, argued that {{sensitivity}} training involves the unethical use of psychological techniques with groups that {{come close to}} brainwashing.|$|R
50|$|Senator James Garfield {{is one of}} the Republican Party {{leaders who}} gather in Chicago in 1882 to discuss the party's future. He is more {{conservative}} than former president Abraham Lincoln and wishes not to make <b>the</b> party <b>more</b> <b>radical.</b>|$|R
5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth and her {{advisers}} {{perceived the}} threat of a Catholic crusade against heretical England. Elizabeth therefore sought a Protestant solution that would not offend Catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of English Protestants; she would not tolerate <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> Puritans though, who were pushing for far-reaching reforms. As a result, the parliament of 1559 started to legislate for a church based on the Protestant settlement of Edward VI, with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as vestments.|$|E
5|$|Following this defeat, the Islamic Courts Union {{splintered}} {{into several}} different factions. Some of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> elements, including Al-Shabaab, regrouped {{to continue their}} insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government's troops.|$|E
50|$|The {{failure of}} Tran Dan-led insurgent {{campaign}} significantly frustrated the intellectuals who naively {{believed that their}} contribution to the revolution had won the party`s trust, and thus prepared the ground for <b>the</b> intellectuals` <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> challenge to <b>the</b> party the following year.|$|R
50|$|Starting in <b>the</b> 1930s, other <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> {{nationalist}} ideas (secularist and separatist) {{began to}} coalece. These reduced {{the influence of}} clerico-nationalism. These <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> ideas took hold in the movements inspired by Paul Bouchard and Adrian Arcand, and the group Jeune-Canada (Young Canada).|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> early 1980s, <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> {{elements}} {{broke away}} from the Rohingya Patriotic Front, and formed the Rohingya Solidarity Organisation (RSO). The RPF ceased activity by the late 1980s.|$|R
5|$|Her first {{acknowledgement}} on {{the national}} level was her appointment in 1919 to honorary vice president of the American Jewish Congress (AJC). Traditionally, the AJC leadership were more focused on European Jews than worldwide outreach and were of the aristocratic, wealthy, Reform tradition. By 1919 the organization had become more diverse and while not necessarily embracing <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> aspects of Zionism, leaders allowed Zionist views to be expressed. Silverman, as an honorary official, could use the status to her advantage: while not officially speaking for the organization, she tacitly had AJC endorsement and was able to parlay that into support from the masses for causes and monetary contributions from elites.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{military}} was widely {{dissatisfied with the}} ceasefire; Kościuszko, Prince Poniatowski and many others would criticize the King's decision and many, including Kościuszko, would resign their commission in the coming weeks. Prince Poniatowski even considered rebelling against his uncle's orders, and even issued orders to bring the King to the army's camp by force if necessary, as was postulated by <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> faction. Ultimately {{he decided not to}} continue fighting against his uncle's will, and the order was rescinded at the last moment before the departure of the group charged with capturing the King.|$|E
5|$|The music {{publishers}} Boosey and Hawkes {{have estimated}} that since its premiere, the ballet {{has been the}} subject of at least 150 productions, many of which have become classics and have been performed worldwide. Among <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> interpretations is Glen Tetley's 1974 version, in which the Chosen One is a young male. More recently there have been solo dance versions devised by Molissa Fenley and Javier de Frutos, a punk rock interpretation from Michael Clark, and Rites (2008), by The Australian Ballet in conjunction with Bangarra Dance Theatre, which represents Aboriginal perceptions of the elements of earth, air, fire and water.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1916 Easter Rising the party's ranks were swelled by participants and supporters of the rebellion as they were freed from British gaols and internment camps, and at its 1917 Ard Fheis (annual conference) de Valera was elected leader and <b>the</b> new, <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> policy adopted.|$|R

5|$|After serving her sentence, she was {{deported}} to Canada, something which left her feeling bitter. There, Max Hyatt, the gothi of the Asatru Alliance-affiliated group Wodan's Kindred, {{invited her to}} live {{at his home in}} Vancouver Island, British Columbia. However, after personal and political differences surfaced, Christensen left Hyatt's home and moved into an RV park in Parksville, Vancouver Island, where she lived in a small trailer. Despite being far less involved in Odinic activities than she had been previously, she set about trying to revive the Odinist Fellowship. In 1998 she began publication of Midgard Page, which was produced in both paper and electronic copies, the latter of which was housed on Hyatt's Wodansdaeg Press website. During her later years, she became more moderate in her views, encouraging a cultural change among Aryans rather than political actions. This contrasted with <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> views of newer groups like Wotansvolk, who embraced militant action to bring about socio-political change. She died on May 4, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Although it was {{the largest}} of the African {{nationalist}} parties, the MNC had many different factions within it that took differing stances on a number of issues. It was increasingly polarised between moderate évolués and <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> mass membership. A radical and federalist faction headed by Ileo and Albert Kalonji split away in July 1959, but failed to induce mass defections by other MNC members. The dissident faction became known as the MNC-Kalonji (MNC-K), while the majority group became the MNC-Lumumba (MNC-L). The split divided the party's support base into those who endured with Lumumba, chiefly in the Stanleyville region in the north-east, and those who backed the MNC-K, popular in the south and among Kalonji's own ethnic group, the Baluba. The MNC-K later formed a cartel with ABAKO and the Parti Solidaire Africain (PSA) to call for a united, but federalised, Congo.|$|E

50|$|Chesler was {{the eldest}} of three {{children}} raised in a working class Orthodox Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York. As a youth she joined the Socialist-Zionist, anti-religious youth movement, HaShomer Hatzair, and later <b>the</b> even <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> left-wing Zionist youth movement, Ein Harod. Despite her parents' disapproval, she continued to rebel against her religious upbringing.|$|R
25|$|Reductive desulfonylation {{reactions}} lead to {{the replacement}} of a carbon-sulfur bond in the sulfonyl group with a carbon-hydrogen bond. Because the sulfonyl group is by definition attached to two carbons, however, reduction to two sets of products is possible. Mechanistic studies of reductions employing metal amalgams as the reducing agent suggest that upon electron transfer to the sulfone, fragmentation to a sulfinate anion and <b>the</b> <b>more</b> stable organic <b>radical</b> occurs. Immediate reduction of the radical and protonation then occur to afford the sulfur-free product derived from <b>the</b> <b>more</b> stable <b>radical.</b> Thus, S-alkyl bonds are cleaved in preference to S-aryl or S-alkenyl bonds.|$|R
5|$|Blaine’s {{career as}} a Republican newspaperman led {{naturally}} to involvement in Republican party politics. In 1856, he was selected as a delegate to the first Republican National Convention. From the party’s early days, Blaine identified with the conservative wing, supporting Supreme Court Justice John McLean for the presidential nomination over <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> John C. Frémont, the eventual nominee. The following year, Blaine was offered the editorship of the Portland Daily Advertiser, which he accepted, selling {{his interest in the}} Journal soon thereafter. He still maintained his home in Augusta, however, with his growing family. Although Blaine’s first son, Stanwood, died in infancy, he and Harriet had two more sons soon afterward: Walker, in 1855, and Emmons, in 1857. They would have four more children in years to come: Alice, James, Margaret, and Harriet. It was around this time that Blaine left the Presbyterian church of his childhood and joined his wife's new denomination, becoming a member of the South Parish Congregational Church in Augusta.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Wilkinson {{served in}} Churchill's wartime {{coalition}} {{as a junior}} minister, mainly at the Ministry of Home Security where she worked under Herbert Morrison. She supported Morrison's attempts to replace Clement Attlee as the Labour Party's leader; nevertheless, when he formed his postwar government, Attlee appointed Wilkinson as Minister of Education. By this time, her health was poor, a legacy of years of overwork. She saw her main task in office as {{the implementation of the}} wartime coalition's 1944 Education Act, rather than <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> introduction of comprehensive schools favoured by many in the Labour Party. Much of her energy was applied to organising the raising of the school-leaving age from 14 to 15. During the exceptionally cold weather of early 1947, she succumbed to a bronchial disease, and died after an overdose of medication, which the coroner at her inquest declared was accidental.|$|E
5|$|In 1263 one of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> barons, Simon de Montfort, seized power, {{resulting}} in the Second Barons' War. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The Battle of Lewes occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, Edward, escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the Dictum of Kenilworth. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, which he had rebuilt {{in the second half}} of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290. Some miracles were declared after his death but he was not canonised.|$|E
50|$|Some {{believe that}} El Para {{actually}} {{works for the}} Algerian government. By late 2003, the group's founder had been supplanted by <b>the</b> even <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> Nabil Sahraoui, who announced his open support for al-Qaeda, thus strengthening government ties between the U.S. and Algeria. He was reportedly killed shortly afterwards, and was succeeded by Abu Musab Abdel Wadoud in 2004.|$|R
50|$|This {{extremely}} controversial {{debate is}} centered around <b>the</b> efficacy of <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> and disruptive tactics (including targeted violence, riots, or general disorder) {{as opposed to}} more mainstream tactics (such as marches, rallies, and political lobbying).|$|R
50|$|Born in Marrickville {{in inner-city}} Sydney, Aarons moved {{with his parents}} and older brother, Laurie, to Melbourne as a young boy.

5|$|In January 1961, {{as part of}} {{the process}} of decolonisation, the island's British {{authorities}} drew up constituencies and held democratic elections. Both the ASP and the ZNP won 11 of the available 22 seats in Zanzibar's Parliament, so further elections were held in June with the number of seats increased to 23. The ZNP entered into a coalition with the Zanzibar and Pemba People's Party (ZPPP) and this time took 13 seats, while the ASP, despite receiving the most votes, won just 10. Electoral fraud was suspected by the ASP and civil disorder broke out, resulting in 68 deaths. To maintain control, the coalition government banned <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> opposition parties, filled the civil service with its own appointees, and politicised the police.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many English, Flood and Grattan {{were also}} proponents of Catholic emancipation, and under their {{leadership}} the Irish Parliament overturned {{a number of}} the restrictions on the rights of Catholics, although they continued to be unable to vote or hold elected offices. When the French Revolution broke out in the early 1790s, Catholics and middle-class Protestants united to form the Society of United Irishmen. They successfully extracted additional rights, although there was some Protestant resistance to the idea of full Catholic suffrage due to their overwhelming numerical majority. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> elements favouring Irish independence found a leader in Theobald Wolfe Tone, who went to France for support from the revolutionaries there that led to an aborted attempt to invade Ireland in 1796. The failed invasion led the government of the Earl of Camden to round up leaders of the United Irishmen and attempt to disarm the Catholic populace. Use of these tactics was made possible in part by the passage of an Insurrection Act, giving the administration broad police powers, and also by the suspension of habeas corpus in October 1796.|$|E
5|$|Heliade {{progressively}} distanced {{himself from}} <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> groups, especially after discussions began {{on the issue of}} land reform and the disestablishment of the boyar class. Initially, he accepted the reforms, and, after the matter was debated within Frăţia just before rebellion broke out, he issued a resolution acknowledging this (the document was probably inspired by Nicolae Bălcescu). The compromise also set other goals, including national independence, responsible government, civil rights and equality, universal taxation, a larger Assembly, five-year terms of office for Princes (and their election by the National Assembly), freedom of the press, and decentralization. On June 21, 1848, present in Islaz alongside Tell and the Orthodox priest known as Popa Şapcă, he read out these goals to a cheering crowd, in what was to be the effective start of the uprising (see Proclamation of Islaz). Four days after the Islaz events, the revolution succeeded in toppling Bibescu, whom it replaced with a Provisional Government which immediately attracted Russian hostility. Presided over by Metropolitan Neofit, it included Heliade, who was also Minister of Education, as well as Tell, Ştefan Golescu, Gheorghe Magheru, and, for a short while, the Bucharest merchant Gheorghe Scurti.|$|E
