25|$|The American {{historian}} Charles Maier rejected Nolte’s claims {{regarding the}} moral equivalence of the Holocaust and Soviet terror {{on the grounds}} that while the latter was extremely brutal, it did not seek the physical annihilation of an entire people as state policy. The American historian Donald McKale blasted both Nolte and Andreas Hillgruber for their statements that the Allied strategic bombing offensives were just as much acts of genocide as the Holocaust, writing that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> sort of nonsense one would expect from Nazi apologists like Nolte and Hillgruber.|$|E
2500|$|To the students’ surprise, the {{government}} {{released a statement}} on February 13 [...] announcing {{that it would not}} allow the students to enter Yangon and that it would take measures to restore stability if the students did not halt their march. The students immediately held a meeting that evening to decide whether they should continue. The day before on February 12, the students sent a delegate to meet with Aung San Su Kyi who then told the students that {{it would be impossible to}} achieve all their demands and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> nature of democracy.|$|E
2500|$|Developers updated their {{engine to}} allow for 150 units {{to be on the}} {{battlefield}} at one time. The game is powered by an upgraded version of Pandemic Studios' Zero engine, and was developed by the same team that worked on the first two [...] installments. Conquest director Eric Gewirtz said the team was [...] "throwing around these ideas, and in perfect serendipity, happened to get access to the Lord of the Rings license, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> center for us on making this game." [...] Howard Shore's music, composed for the film trilogy, was used in the game. The film actors reprise their roles in cutscenes, which are archived footage from the film. In-game likenesses are based on their film counterparts. Hugo Weaving reprises his role as Elrond and serves as the game's narrator. All other cast members were replaced by voice doubles. Chris Edgerly voices Aragorn, Crispin Freeman voices Legolas, Martin Jarvis voices the white wizard Gandalf, and Yuri Lowenthal stands in for Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins.|$|E

2500|$|On 6 December 2013, it was {{announced}} that Turner would return to the soap to reprise her role as Stacey, and would begin filming in January 2014. Turner was quoted as saying: [...] "I may have left EastEnders over three years ago but the show has always been in my heart, as has Stacey, and she has never really left my side. I am so excited about returning and seeing what the future holds for her. [...] It's been a while since I set foot in Albert Square and I am looking forward to coming home." [...] Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins added: [...] "Stacey is one of EastEnders best-loved characters, played by one of television's finest actors, and I am tremendously excited that Lacey has decided to return home to Walford. Stacey's last time on the Square was iconic. But <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> first act. There is so much more to come for Stacey—and her return will send ripples of drama through the Square." [...] Stacey confesses to the murder of Archie Mitchell. Lacey Turner took a break to film the new series of Our Girl. It was confirmed that Stacey will return to EastEnders once filming has finished.|$|E

6000|$|The papa {{could not}} help laughing, because <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> very thing {{he was going to}} say. [...] "Well, all right! What about that story? Do you want to hear it, and take your chances of its being a Prince to the end?" ...|$|E

6000|$|But <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> trouble--they wouldn't. And so in {{course of}} time Mr. Spillikins was compelled, for {{academic}} reasons, to abandon his life work.

6000|$|Frank was {{completely}} bothered.

6000|$|... "My {{little brown}} fawn," [...] he had whispered, [...] "I am always expecting you to {{suddenly}} dig your little heels {{into the ground}} and spring away"; and she had laughed and drawn a little closer to him.

6000|$|... "No, I {{developed}} very quick; <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> reason. When I {{was twenty}} years old I was very highly developed indeed. I was working tooth and nail.

6000|$|... "Then Martha is not changed, {{or nothing}} worth mentioning.
