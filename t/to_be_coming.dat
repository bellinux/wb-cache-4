5|$|Half-Life: Source {{has been}} criticized for not fully {{utilizing}} many of the features of the Source engine found in Half-Life 2, as it still uses textures and models from the original game. In response to this, a third-party mod remake called Black Mesa was developed. The first part of the Black Mesa modification was released on September 14, 2012, with the second promised <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> later.|$|E

5|$|Capturing one of {{the alien}} troops and {{conducting}} the interrogation reveals vague information about another type of alien called the Outsiders, artificially-created crystalline beings encountered aboard UFOs, that appear to serve as pilots and navigators. Dr. Vahlen then requests that XCOM capture an Outsider for study. Upon capturing {{one of the}}se, the examination reveals that the Outsiders' exotic crystalline structures behave {{in a manner similar}} to antennas, receiving a signal broadcast from a location buried underground on Earth. XCOM dispatches a team to investigate the signal; it is found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> from a base that the aliens have secretly established on Earth, where experiments are performed on abducted humans.|$|E

Keseberg told Eddy that he had eaten the remains of Eddy's son, and Eddy swore to murder Keseberg if they ever met in California. George Donner and one of Jacob Donner's children were still alive at Alder Creek. Tamsen Donner had just arrived at the Murphy cabin, and she could have walked out alone but chose {{to return to her}} husband, even though she was informed that no other relief party was likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> soon. Foster and Eddy {{and the rest of the}} third relief left with four children, Trudeau, and Clark.|$|E

50|$|Situated west of {{northern}} Karabakh, outside the official {{boundaries of the}} region, was the rayon of Kelbajar, which bordered Armenia. With {{a population of about}} 60,000, the several dozen villages were made up of Azerbaijani and Kurds. In March 1993, the Armenian-held areas near the Sarsang reservoir in Mardakert <b>were</b> reported <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> under attack by the Azerbaijanis. After successfully defending the Martuni region, Melkonian's fighters <b>were</b> tasked <b>to</b> move to capture the region of Kelbajar, where the incursions and artillery shelling <b>were</b> said <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> from.|$|R
5|$|With the war seen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> to a close, the Army {{decided to}} disband the 6th Brigade and its {{component}} units, {{and as a}} result, the 14th/32nd was disbanded on 21 July 1945, while at Loganlea. During the war the battalion lost 31 men killed or died on active service and a further 46 wounded.

5|$|In Zloda, Belarus, Amador {{uses the}} {{diamonds}} as payment for a proxcard {{to access the}} Todorov Building in Minsk. The team tracks her there, but Amador escapes. Skye and Agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons discover a strange video feed linked to Amador, which they soon discover <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> from a camera in her eye, the source of her apparent 'powers'. Seeing {{the name of the}} hotel Amador is at through the feed, May tracks her down and confronts her. Amador reveals that her prosthetic eye contains a fail safe, so that her handler, who also relays orders in text-form through the eye, can kill her if she refuses to complete her missions. The two fight until Coulson arrives and stuns Amador. Skye hijacks the feed, and relays it through a pair of glasses that Agent Grant Ward wears, carrying out Amador's mission while Agents Fitz and Simmons remove the prosthetic eye.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977, about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen, {{including}} {{a large group of}} Swedish tourists. About 6:20am, the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service, when one of them noticed smoke that seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> from the freight elevator (which had not been used since the café-restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening). The night porter was alerted. Contrary to instructions, he did not call the fire department immediately; instead, he poured some buckets of water into the shaft, in an attempt to subdue the fire. By the time he decided to call the fire department, the hotel was filling with smoke. The night porter was unable to reach the phone at the front desk because the fire had already reached it. The porter then ran outside, where he stopped the driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel, and instructed him to drive to the Hotel Krasnapolsky to warn them and to call the fire department.|$|E

5|$|Back at the TARDIS, Jack begins {{integrating}} the extrapolator into the TARDIS {{to speed up}} the engine recharge. Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he admits to her that he is dating someone else because she is not there for him, and he begs her to promise him that she eventually will come back to him in the end, but before she can answer him, loud sounds like thunder start to reverberate through the area. Cardiff is soon struck by a large earthquake that seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> from the Rift. The Doctor, Margaret, Rose and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Margaret takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console, bathing Margaret in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Margaret's human suit is empty except for a Slitheen egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Margaret wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Margaret can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye, and runs out to look for him in the nearby area, but he is gone. Rose returns to the TARDIS, clearly distraught, and the Doctor offers to wait a little longer so she can search for Mickey, but she declines, saying that he deserves better.|$|E

25|$|Until Ocean Grove's {{municipal}} authority was folded into Neptune Township in 1981, it boasted {{a set of}} unique laws, including one that made it illegal on Sundays to have cars {{on the streets of}} Ocean Grove.

That meant the visitors were likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> for a week-long visit or more. Most came to attend programs sponsored by the Camp Meeting.|$|E
