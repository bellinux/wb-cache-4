40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} {{incidence}} of echodensities in the periventricular white matter, ventricular system, basal ganglia and thalamus of the brain in fetuses at risk for preterm delivery. Methods: This was a prospective study of 124 fetuses with a gestational age between 26 and 34 weeks in pregnancies affected by either pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders or preterm labor. Transvaginal ultrasound examination of the fetal brain in coronal and sagittal planes was performed weekly until delivery and the neonatal brain was examined within 24 h after delivery. Results: In 66 % of all fetuses, echodensities were found {{in one or more}} areas of the brain. They were present in the periventricular area in 52 % of cases, the intraventricular area in 18 % and in the basal ganglia and <b>thalamus</b> <b>area</b> in 28 %. Changes in echogenicity were seen throughout the entire gestational-age period studied. Of the periventricular echodensities that exceeded in echodensity that of the choroid plexus, at least 50 % persisted after delivery; at least 38 % of the intraventricular echodensities and at least 32 % of the basal ganglia and thalamus echodensities persisted after delivery. Conclusions: In high-risk fetuses, echodensities are a frequent finding in several areas in the brain. How far these echodensities are related to future outcome of the infant needs to be investigated. Copyright © 2007 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Articl...|$|E
40|$|Improvements in both obstetric and {{paediatric}} care {{have been responsible}} for a continuing reduction in mortality in extremely premature infants. However, higher survival rates have been at the expense of more long-term neurological damage. Various animal models have been developed to study the effect of hypoxic-ischemic insults on the brain. However, established models like the postnatal day 7 rat model represent damage found in term infants rather than in preterm infants of 24 - 28 weeks' gestation, and produce a severe form of injury resulting in high mortality rates. In this study we developed a reliable model of minor hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in postnatal day 3 rats. At this maturity, the pattern of damage represents that expected in a preterm infant suffering a non-lethal perinatal insult. We found that minor changes in duration of insult and both temperature and humidity produced wide fluctuations in the degree of injury observed. By maintaining strict control over experimental conditions including duration of insult, temperature and humidity, we produced a reliable model of minor injury primarily affecting all five areas of the cerebral cortex, and also the <b>thalamus</b> (<b>area</b> 7) and basal ganglia (area 8).

40|$|Our {{objectives}} were {{to assess whether}} oral exposure to caloric and non-caloric stimuli elicits discriminable responses {{in the brain and}} to determine in how far these responses are modulated by hunger state and sweetness.

Stimuli were solutions of sucralose (sweet, no energy), maltodextrin (non-sweet, energy) and sucralose. +. maltodextrin (sweet, energy). We found no main effect of energy content and no interaction between energy content and sweetness. However, there was an interaction between hunger state and energy content in the median cingulate (bilaterally), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula and thalamus. This indicates that the anterior insula and <b>thalamus,</b> <b>areas</b> in which hunger state and taste of a stimulus are integrated, also integrate hunger state with caloric content of a taste stimulus. Furthermore, in the median cingulate and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, tasting energy resulted in more activation during satiety compared to hunger.

Thalamocortical networks are a potential candidate marker for psychopathology in MDD, {{but have not}} yet been thoroughly investigated. Here we examined functional connectivity between major cortical <b>areas</b> and <b>thalamus.</b> Method: Resting-state fMRI from 54 MDD patients and 40 healthy controls were collected. The cortex was segmented into six regions of interest (ROIs) consisting of frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes and pre-central and post-central gyri. BOLD signal time courses were extracted from each ROI and correlated with voxels in thalamus, while removing signals from every other ROI. Results: Our main findings showed that MDD patients had predominantly increased connectivity between medial <b>thalamus</b> and temporal <b>areas,</b> and between medial <b>thalamus</b> and somatosensory <b>areas.</b> Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between thalamo-temporal connectivity and severity of symptoms. Limitations: Most of the patients in this study were not medication naïve and therefore we cannot rule out possible long-term effects of antidepressant use on the findings. Conclusion: The abnormal connectivity between thalamus and temporal, and thalamus and somatosensory regions may represent impaired cortico-thalamo-cortical modulation underlying emotional, and sensory disturbances in MDD. In the context of similar abnormalities in thalamocortical systems across major psychiatric disorders, thalamocortical dysconnectivity could be a reliable transdiagnostic marker...|$|R

White matter fasciculi represent the primary infrastructure for long distance communication in the brain. In this study, we aimed to investigate the white matter connection in schizophrenia susceptible brain regions of early growth response factor 3 (EGR 3) expressing rats. Methods: A rat model of schizophrenia {{was created by the}} transfection of the EGR 3 gene into rat hippocampus. All animals were placed in a fixation system using a commercial rat-dedicated coil. Schizophrenia susceptible brain regions were scanned using in vivo diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging. The volume, quantity, average length of fiber bundles, fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient, the relative heterosexual fraction, and volume ratio were collected in the whole brain and schizophrenia related brain <b>areas</b> (the hippocampus, <b>thalamus,</b> and prefrontal lobe). MedINRIA software was used for data processing of diffusion tensor and fiber bundles tracking. The fibronectin in relevant brain regions was also analyzed. Results: There was a significant decrease in the volume of the fiber beam through the left hippocampus dentate in the schizophrenia model group in comparison to the control group and the risperidone treatment group (P< 0. 05).

We therefore proposed to evaluate the neurobiological effects of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) on 19 patients with drug-naïve PTSD without comorbidity, matched with 19 untreated healthy controls. METHODS: We administered the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and conducted brain MRI measurements (with Optimized Voxel-Based Morphometry). Patients received 12 EMDR sessions over three months. Then patients and controls were reassessed. RESULTS: At baseline, grey matter volume (GMV) differed significantly between patients and controls (F 1, 35 = 3. 674; p=. 008; η 2 =. 298). Analyses of 3 -month scans showed no changes for controls, while significant changes were highlighted for patients post-EMDR, with {{a significant increase in}} GMV in left parahippocampal gyrus, and a significant decrease in GMV in the left thalamus region. The diagnosis of PTSD was effectively eliminated in 16 of 19 patients, reflected in a significant improvement on the CAPS (t(35) = 2. 132, p<. 004). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated post-EMDR changes for patients in brain morphology.

From the ﬁ rst evening WMZ (i. e. during a normal waking day) to the second (i. e. following 40 h of continuous waking), PER 3 5 / 5 individuals relative to PER 3 4 / 4 showed significantly larger increase in responses in the left mid-cingulate, bilateral precuneus and thalamus. Interestingly, these regions are involved in executive processes and arousal regulation (thalamus). Conclusions: These {{results show that the}} strong circadian wake-maintenance signal depends on sleep pressure, in a PER 3 -genotype dependent manner. Interestingly, pronounced genotype differences were observed in the <b>thalamus,</b> an <b>area</b> that compensates potential lower cortical activity under SD. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Several neuroimaging meta-analyses have {{summarized}} structural brain {{changes in}} major depression using coordinate-based methods. These methods might be biased toward brain regions where {{significant differences were}} found in the original studies. In this study, a novel voxel-based technique is implemented that estimates and meta-analyses between-group differences in grey matter from individual MRI studies, which are then applied to the study of major depression. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies were conducted comparing participants with major depression and healthy controls by using statistical parametric maps. Summary effect sizes were computed correcting for multiple comparisons at the voxel level. Publication bias and heterogeneity were also estimated and the excess of heterogeneity was investigated with metaregression analyses. Results: Patients with major depression were characterized by diffuse bilateral grey matter loss in ventrolateral and ventromedial frontal systems extending into temporal gyri compared to healthy controls. Grey matter reduction was also detected in the right parahippocampal and fusiform gyri, hippocampus, and bilateral <b>thalamus.</b> Other <b>areas</b> included parietal lobes and cerebellum. There was no evidence of statistically significant publication bias or heterogeneity. Conclusions: The novel computational meta-analytic approach used in this study identified extensive grey matter loss in key brain regions implicated in emotion generation and regulation. Results are not biased toward the findings of the original studies because they include all available imaging data, irrespective of statistically significant regions, resulting in enhanced detection of additional areas of grey matter loss.

40|$|Background Imaging {{studies have}} {{provided}} evidence that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) {{is able to}} change brain activation in phobic patients in response to threatening stimuli. The changes occurred in both emotion-generating and modulatory regions. In this study, we use a data-driven approach to explore resting state cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured by arterial spin labeling (ASL), before and after CBT. Methods Eight female patients with spider phobia were scanned before and 1 month after an exposure-based group therapy for spider phobia. Each MRI session consisted of an ASL resting state measurement acquired before and after a symptom provocation task involving the showing of spider pictures in the scanner. The first ASL acquisition measured anticipatory anxiety and the second measured postprocessing of phobia-relevant stimuli. Results Cognitive-behavioral therapy significantly reduced spider phobic symptoms in all patients. Symptom reduction during anticipatory anxiety was accompanied by reduced bilateral CBF in the parahippocampal gyrus, ventral anterior <b>thalamus,</b> Brodmann <b>area</b> 8, and the anterior cingulate cortex. During postprocessing of phobia-relevant stimuli, patients showed reduced CBF in the bilateral insula, components of the motor cortex, and areas associated with language functions. Conclusions Longitudinal CBF dynamics following CBT were in concordance with results from several studies using BOLD fMRI to investigate the effects of psychotherapy on brain activity. CBF can be quantified by ASL, with the principal advantage of sensitivity to slow variations in neural activity and task independence. Therefore, ASL may be a suitable method for monitoring and evaluating the efficacy of psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy approaches...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 63 - 68) In view {{of recent}} {{reports that the}} electrical activity of the rat pineal gland could be depressed or altered by photic stimulation, {{the present study was}} designed to look at differences in multiple unit activity in response to various frequencies of photic stimulation. Male rats were placed in one of three conditions for 42 days: Normal cycle; constant dark; constant light. Following this period, the multiple unit activity from three different brain <b>areas</b> (pineal gland, <b>thalamus,</b> preoptic <b>area)</b> was recorded for each animal. Sample photos of unit activity were analyzed for unit firing rate and amplitude of the response. Also, retinal tissue was examined for signs of retinal degeneration. Results showed that while photic stimulation had no effect on multiple unit activity, both constant light and constant dark resulted in decreased amplitude of electrical activity in all three brain areas. In the Pineal gland this decrease was significantly more than in normals. Further, there was a tendency for both the pineal and the preoptic area to show rhythmic fluctuations in electrical activity in relation to the. time of day, and the firing rate of units in the preoptic area was highest in normals, intermediate in constant dark animals, and lowest in constant light animals suggesting a possible pineal gland - hypothalamic relationship, involving both endogenous and exogenous rhythms. A model is presented which indicates the possible pathways thereby these rhythmic responses are mediated in both the pineal gland and the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. The results are discussed in relation to the model...|$|R
