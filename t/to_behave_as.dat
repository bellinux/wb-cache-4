5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in group 16 as the heaviest chalcogen, although it has not been confirmed <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> the heavier homologue to the chalcogen polonium. Livermorium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues (oxygen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium), and be a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major differences from them.|$|E
5|$|Allen, Messori, and Plunkett also {{state that}} accusations that Opus Dei is secretive are unfounded. These accusations {{stem from a}} {{clerical}} paradigm which expects Opus Dei members <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> monks and clerics, people who are traditionally known and externally identifiable as seekers of holiness. In contrast, these journalists continue, Opus Dei's lay members, like any normal Catholic professional, are ultimately responsible for their personal actions, and do not externally represent the organization which provides them religious education. Writer and broadcast analyst John L. Allen, Jr. states that Opus Dei provides abundant information about itself. These journalists have stated that the historic roots of criticisms against Opus Dei {{can be found in}} influential clerical circles.|$|E

5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in the boron group, although it has not been confirmed <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> the heavier homologue to thallium in the boron group. Nihonium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues, boron, aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium, and behave as a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major differences from them. Unlike all the other p-block elements, it may be able to involve its d-electrons in bonding, although these predictions are disputed.|$|E
5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> if they were free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, {{they are free to}} move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E
5|$|Moscovium is an {{extremely}} radioactive element: its most stable known isotope, moscovium-290, has a half-life of only 0.8seconds. In the periodic table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It {{is a member of}} the 7th period and is placed in group 15 as the heaviest pnictogen, although it has not been confirmed <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> a heavier homologue of the pnictogen bismuth. Moscovium is calculated to have some properties similar to its lighter homologues, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth, and to be a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major differences from them. About 100 atoms of moscovium have been observed to date, all of which have been shown to have mass numbers from 287 to 290.|$|E

50|$|Aluminium {{hydroxide}} {{also finds}} {{use as a}} fire retardant filler for polymer applications {{in a similar way}} to magnesium hydroxide and mixtures of huntite and hydromagnesite. It decomposes at about 180 C, absorbing a considerable amount of heat in the process and giving off water vapour. In addition <b>to</b> <b>behaving</b> <b>as</b> a fire retardant, it is very effective as a smoke suppressant {{in a wide range of}} polymers, most especially in polyesters, acrylics, ethylene vinyl acetate, epoxies, PVC and rubber.|$|R

5|$|Polistes exclamans have comparably smaller nests and colonies {{compared}} to certain other eusocial wasps species. Thus, {{it is common}} for the nest to be destroyed, for the queen to die prior {{to the end of the}} season, or for the nest to fail through other means, such as predation, parasitisation, or worker mortality, leading workers to help rear broods that are less related to them than are their sister wasps. Due to this, it would be advantageous for there to be wasps that remain casteless till adulthood, allowing female wasps’ reproductive capabilities to be plastic. It has thus been predicted that Polistes exclamans worker wasps would act as workers if a brood were present and would begin to develop gyne characteristics if a brood was not present, exhibiting the aforementioned adaptive plasticity. Experimentally, this has been found to be true. Solis and Strassmann conducted a study in which an experimental group had the eggs and larvae removed. In the experimental group, the wasps began to behave like future queens and even developed the characteristic layer of fat common to queens. In the control group, the wasps continued <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> workers. This is indicative that the presence of the brood affects caste differentiation and that Polistes exclamans female workers exhibits adaptive reproductive plasticity.|$|E

25|$|The Appreciation of {{a system}} {{involves}} understanding how interactions (i.e., feedback) between the elements {{of a system}} can result in internal restrictions that force the system <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> a single organism that automatically seeks a steady state. It is this steady state that determines the output of the system rather than the individual elements. Thus it is the structure of the organization rather than the employees, alone, which holds the key to improving the quality of output.|$|E
50|$|Transition metal thiolate {{complexes}} are metal complexes containing thiolate ligands. Thiolates are ligands {{that can}} be classified as soft Lewis bases. Therefore, thiolate ligands coordinate most strongly <b>to</b> metals that <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> soft Lewis acids as opposed <b>to</b> those that <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> hard Lewis acids. Most complexes contain other ligands in addition to thiolate, but many homoleptic complexes are known with only thiolate ligands. The amino acid cysteine has a thiol functional group, consequently many cofactors in proteins and enzymes feature cysteinate-metal cofactors.|$|R

25|$|It {{is known}} by Euler's {{rotation}} theorem that, for any rotating frame, there always exists an instantaneous {{axis of rotation}} in any instant. In {{the case of a}} frame, the angular velocity vector is over the instantaneous axis of rotation. Any transversal section of a plane perpendicular to this axis has <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> a two dimensional rotation. Thus, the magnitude of the angular velocity vector at a given time t is consistent with the two dimensions case.|$|E
25|$|Unlike liquids and solids, gases are {{composed}} of discrete molecules which occupy {{only a small fraction}} of the volume filled by the gas. On a molecular level, flow fields are made up of the collisions of many individual of gas molecules between themselves and with solid surfaces. However, in most aerodynamics applications, the discrete molecular nature of gases is ignored, and the flow field is assumed <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> a continuum. This assumption allows fluid properties such as density and flow velocity to be defined everywhere within the flow.|$|E
25|$|The protein encoded by the casein kinase 1 epsilon gene is a serine/threonine {{protein kinase}} {{and a member}} of the casein kinase I protein family, whose members have been implicated in the control of cytoplasmic and nuclear processes, {{including}} DNA replication and repair. Like other casein kinase 1 protein family members, casein kinase 1 epsilon recognizes the Ser(p)XXSer/Thr motif for phosphorylation. It is found in the cytoplasm as a monomer and can phosphorylate a variety of proteins, including itself. This autophosphorylation occurs in the protein's C-Terminal domain, a region believed <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> a pseudosubstrate, and inhibits kinase activity.|$|E

25|$|The kernel has {{full access}} to the system's memory and must allow {{processes}} to safely access this memory as they require it. Often {{the first step in}} doing this is virtual addressing, usually achieved by paging and/or segmentation. Virtual addressing allows the kernel to make a given physical address appear to be another address, the virtual address. Virtual address spaces may be different for different processes; the memory that one process accesses at a particular (virtual) address may be different memory from what another process accesses at the same address. This allows every program <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> if it is the only one (apart from the kernel) running and thus prevents applications from crashing each other.|$|E

Cutolo challenged the old Camorra bosses and gave the youngsters a structure to belong to: “The new Camorra must have a statute, a structure, an oath, a complete ceremony, a ritual that must excite people {{to the point that they}} would risk their lives for this organization.” Cutolo was revered by his soldiers. They called him Prince and kissed his left hand as if he were a bishop.|$|E
25|$|Mei Quong Tart {{was born}} in 1850 {{in the village of}} Shandi (山底), Duanfen (端芬鎮) in {{southern}} Taishan, Guangdong province, China. His father, named Mei Kuoyuan, was a fairly successful merchant dealing in ornamental wares. Quong Tart immigrated to Australia in 1859 with his uncle, transporting a shipload of coolies to the goldfields around Araluen and Braidwood in regional New South Wales. Once in Braidwood, Quong Tart lived at Bell's Creek in the store of Scottish Thomas Forsyth. In the following years, he was taken in by the wealthy family of Robert Percy Simpson, whose wife Alice Simpson, née Want, was charmed by his Scottish accent. Under the Simpsons, Quong Tart learnt <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> a proper English gentleman and converted to Christianity.|$|E
