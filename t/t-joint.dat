The degree of non-linearity from the measured stress distributions around the weld toes of the brace-chord junction showed that stress distribution is significantly non-linear, along specified locations for brace diameter to chord width ratios greater than 0. 5. The quadratic method of extrapolation of local strains/stresses to determine hot spot stresses is recommended.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{ultimate}} {{static strength}} of tubular joints is usually calculated {{at the design stage}} based on empirical formulae incorporating the joint geometry, loading mode and materials strength.
