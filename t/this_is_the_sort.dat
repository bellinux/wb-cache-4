The reviewer in The Times remarked that “the writer of the original story, Mr Nigel Kneale, and the director, Mr Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the right speed, without digressions. The film has an air {{of respect for the}} issues touched on, and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally”. On the other hand, Jympson Harman of the London Evening News wrote: “Science-fiction hokum can be convincing, exciting or just plain laughable. Quatermass II [...] fails on all these scores, I am afraid”. Similarly, the reviewer in the Daily Herald felt “The whole thing is daft and full of stilted dialogue. [...] At the end a detective says: “How am I going to make a report on all this?” I felt the same way”.|$|E

This has led him to the view (also considered in a 1981 paper by Richard Feynman) that nature is discrete rather than continuous. He suggests that space consists of a set of isolated points, like cells in a cellular automaton, and that even time flows in discrete steps. Following an idea of Edward Fredkin, he concludes that the universe itself would then be an automaton, like a giant computer. It's possible, but I can't see any motivation for these speculations, except that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> of system that Wolfram and others have become used to in their work on computers.

2500|$|Of all his {{research}} and experimentation, Chang's work in {{in vitro fertilisation}} was arguably his greatest achievement. [...] In 1935, Gregory Pincus had claimed to have achieved successful mammal birth from the result of in vitro fertilisation of rabbit eggs. [...] As nobody, including Chang, could repeat this feat at <b>the</b> time, doubts <b>were</b> cast over <b>the</b> authenticity of the claim. [...] Then finally, in 1959, Chang in vitro fertilised a black rabbit's eggs with a black rabbit's sperm, transferred them to a white rabbit, {{and was able to}} produce a litter of young black rabbits. [...] <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> of evidence attesting to the feasibility of in vitro fertilisation for which many scientists had been searching. [...] In the years that followed, Chang and his associates conducted further research to determine specific conditions of successful in vitro fertilisation as well as to perform the technique on other mammals such as hamsters, mice, and rats. [...] It <b>was</b> on <b>the</b> basis of Chang's findings that the first in vitro fertilisation of human eggs was performed, leading to the birth of the world's first [...] "test tube baby" [...] in 1978.|$|R

[...] There is also a floor-mosaic from Vienne, now in the museum at Saint-Romain-en-Gal, with Lycurgus alone inside the vine. The preceding scene of Lycurgus attacking Ambrosia, is on a floor-mosaic at Brading Roman Villa on the Isle of Wight. [...] Of this and similar mosaics, Martin Henig says: [...] "In cases such as this, we are not concerned with simple, popular paganism but with recondite knowledge. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> of esoteric religion which the Emperor Julian, Symmachus, Praetextatus, Macrobius and Proclus relished.

Stelmach also found himself in a feud with Calgary mayor Dave Bronconnier during his first year as premier as Bronconnier accused Stelmach of failing to keep a promise to the city regarding infrastructure spending during his first budget. Several Stelmach supporters suggested that the mayor, a Liberal, might be angling to take over as leader of the official opposition if Kevin Taft fumbled.
