40|$|Tail bays (TB) of Gabčíkovo Water Work {{belong to}} the biggest in Europe. They enable to {{overcome}} the altitude difference of water levels between the incoming and outlet chanel {{in the range of}} 16 – 23, 3 m. On the above heading are installed segment shutters; the bottom heading is locked with rotating gates. With a huge amount of water, one <b>tail</b> <b>bay</b> is filled up in 18 – 22 minutes to the high of 20 m. The rising water pressure affects the deformations of gates, whose width is 2 metres and weight is 435 tons ([URL] //mesto. sk, 2004). The previous gate deformation measurements were determined only in some discrete points on the gate. But, no method of deformation measurement on the whole area of the gate at many points was used so far. In the engineering surveying was used a laser scanning technology for the purpose of documentations. In a range of international projects between the Geodesy Institute of Technical University in Munich and the Department of Surveying of Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, an initial practical knowledge the gate deformation measurement of the right <b>tail</b> <b>bay</b> at the Gabčíkovo Water Work was obtained by using the laser scanning technology (LST). The new laser scanning technology, characterized with the area data acquisition of high density, satisfied the accuracy and the short time of acquisition was used for the first time for a purpose of the gate deformation measurement of TB. The HDS 2500 laser terrestrial scanner fy Leica Geosystems was used with the variantion of the point position determination of 6 mm for the 50 m distance ([URL] 2004). Measurements with LST were carried out on the airy side of the bottom TB. According to the time influence of individual water level altitudes two types of measurements were carried out. At static anditions, the measurements where scanned at aconstant water level altitude (19, 3 m, 13, 0 m, 9, 4 m a 4, 4 m). Whole gates were scanned by two scans with a raster of 10 × 10 cm per 150 seconds. The significant transverse deformations of the bottom TB gate are at 9, 4 m in the range of 1, 5 cm – 2, 5 cm – they are shown first of all in a bottom half of gate by the water level altitude of 13, 0 m in the range of 1, 5 cm – 3, 0 cm. By a state of maximal loading of TB gate are deformations in a range of 3, 0 to 3, 7 cm in a bottom part. Dynamical measurements are carried out with a repeated scanning of a part of gate during the process of filling and emptying of TB, i. e. rising and lowering of water level altitude. The velocity of rising or sinking of water level altitude in TB is ca 1, 6 m per minute. To have a constant ratio of gate loading in the time of one scan, the scanning was with a raster of 8 × 8 cm per 30 seconds for only one selected part of the right gate (a tight vertical strip in a middle of TB), in which the biggest deformations were predicted. Dynamical deformations of a part of TB during the process of filling and emptying is presented by the animation from the 49 stages (loading states). The water level altitude difference between two stages is 80 cm for 30 seconds. The laser scanning technology introduces a new method of deformation measurements. Its advantage is the measurement velocity and the determination of deformations in the whole area of the measured object by static as well as dynamical measurements...|$|E
40|$|The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) {{extension}} plan {{includes the}} construction of a third lane with new locks at both sides of the Canal. The design ship is a so-called Post- Panamax 12 000 TEU container carrier. In order to maximize the transit throughput of the new locks, and at the same time, to limit hawser forces under an acceptable maximum threshold, many numerical studies and two physical model studies have been carried out. In a first phase, the filling and emptying (F/E) system of the locks has been preoptimized with numerical models (1 D, 2 D and 3 D models). Then, to complete the design, a study have been carried out on a 1 / 30 physical scale model at Compagnie Nationale du Rhône Hydraulic Laboratory, Lyon, France, operating as member of the consortium CPP. The F/E system is a “double culverts” sidewall and ports system composed of: a main culvert connected by a central flow divider to two secondary culverts in middle section of the lock chamber; each secondary culvert is equipped with 10 ports which feed the lock on 80 % of its length. In order to limit water consumption, each lock includes 3 Water Saving Basins (WSB). The scale model represents two locks chambers, 3 WSB associated with the lower chamber, a fore and a <b>tail</b> <b>bay.</b> The Post-Panamax container ship vessel is also modelled. A special emphasis is put on the hawser forces measurements and in the definition of a threshold value for them as no standard values presently exists for Post-Panamax locks given such operating conditions (use of water saving basins or not, hydraulic heads ranging from 3. 5 m to 20 m). The experimental setup and the scenarios of tests are described and an overview of the main results (F/E times, times series of water levels with and without ship in the lock chamber, time series of hydraulic efforts on the ship hull) are given. The results of this physical model are an input for the design-build tender for {{the construction of}} the third set of locks, presently in progress...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Understanding the {{influences}} of water level on seepage stability of <b>tailing</b> <b>bay</b> is an important topics in hydraulic engineering design. The seepage stability of <b>tailing</b> <b>bay</b> under different water level was calculated with the numerical simulation software FLAC 3 D and the change laws of water pore pressure and saturation line in the dam was analyzed. The {{results show that the}} saturation line in the dam is a parabolic curve and the pore pressure changes in layers. With the increasing of water level, the saturation line in the heaping dam ups rather obviously while it is not obvious in the initial dam. The maximum pore pressure {{in the bottom of the}} dam increases with the relationship of water level up, the shallow of the saturation line is in the heaping dam heel...|$|R

50|$|Melanins, {{which provide}} {{color in the}} eyes, skin, and hair, are found in two types: eumelanin, which {{produces}} black to brown pigment, and phaeomelanin, which produces red to yellow pigment. Most horses can produce both types; the brown appearance of a bay horse's coat is caused by alternating bands of eumelanin and phaeomelanin, for which the agouti gene is responsible. Eumelanin predominates in the legs, mane and <b>tail</b> of <b>bay</b> horses. By contrast, horses which lack a functional agouti gene cannot produce such alternating bands, and thus have wholly black coats with no visible phaeomelanin. Chestnut horses lack the ability to manufacture eumelanin altogether, and so have wholly red coats devoid of true black pigment.|$|R
5|$|The YF-22 was {{designed}} to meet USAF requirements for survivability, supercruise, stealth, and ease of maintenance. Because Lockheed's submission was selected {{as one of the}} winners, the company, through its Skunk Works division, assumed leadership of the program partners. It would be responsible for the forward cockpit and fuselage, as well as final assembly at Palmdale, California. Meanwhile, the wings and aft fuselage would be built by Boeing, with the center fuselage, weapons <b>bays,</b> <b>tail</b> and landing gears built by General Dynamics. Compared with its Northrop/McDonnell Douglas counterpart, the YF-22 has a more conventional design – its wings have larger control surfaces, such as full-span trailing edge, and, whereas the YF-23 had two tail surfaces, the YF-22 had four, which made it more maneuverable than its counterpart. Two examples of each prototype air vehicle (PAV) were built for the Demonstration-Validation phase: one with General Electric YF120 engines, the other with Pratt & Whitney YF119 engines.|$|R
40|$|This is an author's peer-reviewed final manuscript, as {{accepted}} by the publisher. The published article is copyrighted by EVJ Ltd., and published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. It can be found at: [URL] regarding signalment, clinical findings, treatment, and outcome of 5 previously reported cases of anaplastic malignant melanoma of the tail in non-grey horses and of 5 additional cases are summarized. Age was recorded for 9 horses and mean age was 16 years, range 8 to 23 years. Gender was recorded for 8 horses and 6 of these 8 horses were male horses over 14 years of age. The most common coat colour was bay (6 horses). Other coat colours were palomino (1 horse), chestnut (1 horse), and black (1 horse); coat colour of 1 non-grey horse was not specified. Follow up information was available for 9 horses and only 1 horse, a palomino, survived more than 10 months following diagnosis and tail amputation. Surgical excision, including tail amputation and medical therapy with oral cimetidine, was not effective in non-grey, non-palomino horses. Tumour recurred on tail tissue remaining after amputation in 2 horses, widespread metastases were documented in 4 cases, and metastasis was suspected {{at the time of}} death or euthanasia in 3 cases, including 1 case with amputation site regrowth. No subjective histopathologic differences were detected in the palomino that survived as compared to horses of other coat colours. Findings suggest that anaplastic malignant melanoma of the <b>tail</b> in <b>bay,</b> chestnut, and black horses is most often a very aggressive neoplasm, but that there are rare exceptions...|$|R
60|$|The officer's mount was a bay--a fine horse, {{though not}} to be spoken of with Violette; yet it was a {{powerful}} brute, {{and it seemed to}} me that in a few miles its freshness might tell. I waited until the lad was a long way in front of his comrades, and then I eased my mare down a little--a very, very little, so that he might think he was really catching me. When he came within pistol-shot of me I drew and cocked my own pistol, and laid my chin upon my shoulder to see what he would do. He did not offer to fire, and I soon discerned the cause. The silly boy had taken his pistols from his holsters when he had camped for the night. He wagged his sword at me now and roared some threat or other. He did not seem to understand that he was at my mercy. I eased Violette down until there was not the length of a long lance between the grey <b>tail</b> and the <b>bay</b> muzzle.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} multisatellite and ground {{observations}} of two pseudo-substorm onset {{events that occurred}} successively at 0747 UT and 0811 UT, May 30, 1985, with {{more attention to the}} 0747 UT onset. The distinguishing features of the 0747 UT event are as follows. (1) The substorm-associated tail reconfiguration started in a very localized region in the near-Earth magnetotail. (2) The magnitude of the current disruption decreased markedly as the disruption region expanded tailward. (3) On the ground the onset of a very small negative bay (approx. 40 nT) was observed simultaneously with the onset of the current disruption, but over a much wider local time sector than the near-Earth <b>tail</b> reconfiguration. Positive <b>bay</b> onsets at mid-latitudes also had a longitudinally wide distribution. From these features we infer than in the present event the current disruption took place filamentarily near AMPTE/CCE at approx. 8. 8 R(sub E). It is also inferred that pseudo-substorm onsets are distinguished from standard substorm onsets by the absence of a global expansion of the current disruption, and that the spatial scales of the onset region in the magnetosphere is not a major difference between the two. The present study suggests that the spatial distribution of the magnetic distortion before onsets is an important factor to determine the expansion scale of the current disruption. It is also suggested that the current disruption is basically an internal process of the magnetosphere...|$|R
50|$|The Grunau 9 was a German {{single seat}} trainer glider, {{one of the}} first of a group that later became known as primary gliders.

40|$|Coastal piracy in {{southeast}} China {{during the late}} eighteenth and early nineteenth century was caused by such factors as the conflict between dominant continental values and peripheral maritime interests, the legacy of Ho-shen's maladministration, the explosive population growth, {{the deterioration of the}} imperial navy, and the Annamese civil war. During the late eighteenth century, the waters of Fukien and Chekiang were infested by an Annamese pirate fleet working in concert with Chinese pirate groups, including the Phoenix <b>Tails,</b> the Water <b>Bays,</b> and the Bamboo-yellows. The total strength of these pirate groups was about two hundred ships and ten thousand men. However, in the years following 1800 the configuration of pirate power in Fukien and Chekiang water underwent a profound change. This change was triggered by a "divine wind" which arose in mid-August 1800, which led to the demise of the Annamese fleet and other leading pirate bands. As a result, by the end of 1802 the waters of southeast China were dominated by a new generation of pirate association led by Ts'ai Ch'ien, Chang Ah-chih, Chu Fen, Ch'en Huang-k'uei, and other lesser chieftains. The imperial suppression campaigns initiated by Juan Yuan and Li Ch'ang-keng were hindered by uncooperative officials like Yu-te, A-linpao, and other Fukien authorities, who advocated a policy of "pardon and enticement" rather than aggressive counter measures. The situation was further worsened when Ts'ai Ch'ien obtained a number of "giant ocean-crossing junks" from Fukien shipbuilders and extended his sphere of influence to the waters of Taiwan. The pirate problem reached its peak between 1806 and 1807, when both Ts'ai Ch'ien and Chu Fen sought to challenge the legitimacy of Manchu rule through their conquest of Taiwan. However, both failed in their respective attempts to establish a maritime regime on Taiwan. By 1810, the fleets of Ts'ai Ch'ien, Chu Fen, Chang Ah-chih and others had been destroyed or pacified by the suppression tactics of the imperial authorities. Finally, the dissertation analyzes pirate organizations in terms of their inter-group relationships, internal structures, membership, ideologies, criminal activities, on-shore connections, and financial networks...|$|R
40|$|As I {{wrote my}} paper on Sciurus (Rheithrosciurus) microtis, see Notes from the Leyden Museum, Part I, 1879, p. 40, I knew Rheithrosciurus macrotis {{only from the}} both short {{annotations}} of the late Gray about that Squirrel. I here verbally copie his descriptions: Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond. 1856, p. 341, pl. XLVI, he writes: »Among the specimens of animals which the British Museum has lately received from Mr. Wallace from Sarawak, is a large, well-marked species of Squirrel, particular for having very large, longish pencilled ears like the European species, with a broad white streak on {{the upper part of}} each side, and a very broad full tail, grisled, with large white tips to the hairs. Sciurus macrotis. Ears large, with large pencil of elongate hairs. Dark chestnut-brown, very minutely grisled with pale tips to the hairs. Rump, outside of thighs and base of tail redder; point of thighs bright bay; feet blackish; upper part of the side with a broad pale streak; cheeks and inner side of legs paler; chin, throat, and beneath white; tail very broad, with very long white-tipped hairs. Length 13, tail 11 = 24 inches. Hab. Sarawak (Mr. Wallace). ” — and: Ann. and Mag. of Nat. Hist. 1867, p. 271, we read: »The front edge of the cutting-teeth broad, rounded, closely longitudinally grooved. Rheithrosciurus nov. gen. Head large, compressed, short; ears large, with a pencil of elongated hairs at the tip; cutting-teeth broad, rounded in front and closely longitudinally grooved. The limbs free; feet large, strong. Tail as long as the body and head, very thick, clavate, covered with long flaccid hairs. The grooving of the teeth is a pecularity not observed in any other Sciuridae. Rheithrosciurus macrotis. Brown, very minutely punctulated; throat and beneath white; lateral streaks broad, yellowish; front of thighs <b>bay.</b> <b>Tail</b> blackish, whitish washed. Hab. Sarawak (Wallace). Type in B. M. ” — In my above mentioned paper I already briefly showed that these descriptions are highly short and that they do not agree the one with the other. As I often before had seen Squirrels with grooved upper cutting-teeth, that is to say, where those teeth are provided each with one or two grooves and while Gray in his first description entirely had overlooked this character, I thought that his words »cutting-teeth closely longitudinally grooved” in his second note should be understood as only relating the upper ones, for squirrels with grooved lower cutting-teeth were not known. In my opinion now the grooving of the upper cutting-teeth in squirrels has no generic value, but my Saleyer squirrel presenting that character, I placed the latter in the neighborhood of Gray’s squirrel, but with Gray’s generic title Rheithrosciurus in Parenthesi. In doing so I only intented to fix the attention of the readers on the always excellent character of the grooved cuttingteeth in distinguishing species. Anderson in his »Yunnan-Expedition” says not a single word about the grooved character of the incisors, and he describes the squirrel as follows: »The head is large, compressed and short. The ears are large with a pencil of elongated hairs at their tips, the feet are large and strong and the sides of the animal are laterally banded. The general colour of the animal is dark-nutbrown, very minutely punctulated; the hind quarter, including the base of the tail and the outside of the fore- and hindlimbs bright bay; the feet blackish. There is a brownish band from the axilla to the groin, with a yellowish white band about it. The cheeks and inner sides of the limbs are pale brownish, grizzled and with long white tips to the hairs. Habitat. Sarawak. Borneo. ” Afterwards my friend Trouessart in his Catalogue des Mammifères vivants et fossiles 1880 p. 69 (12), united my microtis with Gray’s macrotis in the genus Rheithrosciurus Thereupon I wrote to Trouessart that I did not accept that genus, as there were still more squirrels which show the same character, but for the rest belong to the most different groups and I shortly explained why I had placed my squirrel in the neighborhood of Gray’s species. But I hardly can express my astonishment as I saw in the Paris Museum and afterwards in the British Museum specimens of Rheithrosciurus macrotis! Indeed it is the most splendid squirrel that I ever saw. The coloring of the body generally resembles that of Sciurus prevostii: like in that species each side is ornated with a broad white band. But the ears are longer than in any other squirrel, viz: 30 mm., they are embellished with a very long tuft measuring 45 mm., the whole ear with pencil also measures about 75 mm. The tail is very bushy and resembles that organ in Chirormjs madagascariensis; its length is about 280 mm. without tuft, while it measures the tuft included 292 mm., also much longer than the body (c. f. Gray’s measures above given), which measures the head included 235 mm. The hairs of the tail are long 92 mm., so that, if the hairs are spread out, the tail has a diameter of about 185 mm...|$|R
