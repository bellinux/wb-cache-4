5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the float <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>this</b> slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under slight tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E
5|$|A {{traditional}} {{thesis is}} that cavalry assumed {{a much greater}} importance in the 4th-century army than it enjoyed in the 2nd century. According to this view, cavalry increased significantly {{as a proportion of}} the total forces and took over the leading tactical role from the infantry. It also enjoyed much higher status than in the 2nd century. At the same time, the infantry declined in efficiency and value in operations, leaving the cavalry as the effective arm. In fact, there is no good evidence <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>this</b> view, and plenty of evidence against it.|$|E

5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after {{the peak in}} the second wave. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in the}} week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cadbury Camp is an Iron Age hill fort in Somerset, England, {{near the}} village of Tickenham. It is a {{scheduled}} monument. Although primarily known as a fort during the Iron Age it is likely, from artefacts, including a bronze spear or axe head, discovered at the site, that it was first used in the Bronze Age and still occupied through the Roman era into the Anglo-Saxon period. It has been associated with Arthurian England and Camelot; however there is no evidence <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E

5|$|Concerned that {{allegations}} of communists in the SCLC, if made public, would derail the administration's civil rights initiatives, Kennedy warned King to discontinue these associations, and later {{felt compelled to}} issue the written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover feared the Civil Rights movement and investigated the {{allegations of}} communist infiltration. When no evidence emerged <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>this,</b> the FBI used the incidental details caught on tape {{over the next five}} years in attempts to force King out of his leadership position, in the COINTELPRO program.|$|E
5|$|If {{used as a}} {{space for}} rituals, the Hampton Down circle would have only been able to {{accommodate}} a few individuals standing within it at any given time. It was also not the site of any cremation deposits, unlike some stone circles in Northern Britain. Burl suggested that the Hampton Down Stone Circle may never {{have been part of}} the prehistoric stone circle tradition, but that the stones were actually once the kerbstones of a round barrow. <b>To</b> <b>support</b> <b>this</b> suggestion, he noted that round barrows were known at Poole, around 20 miles (32 kilometres) to the east of the site.|$|E

5|$|Morotai {{remained}} an important Allied base after Leyte was secured.

From April 1945, the island was also used by the Australian I Corps to mount the Borneo Campaign.

5|$|The creek's use as {{a tribal}} {{boundary}} is disputed. As other southern California Native Americans have done, a tribe typically claimed {{both sides of a}} stream or river—and used drainage divides as boundaries instead. However, the presence of Aliso Canyon, a steep and difficult-to-traverse gorge, suggests the opposite. Kroeber (1907) was the first <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>this</b> theory, and many other archaeologists have followed as well. The Juaneño disagree, arguing that their boundary stretches north to the northern drainage divide of the Aliso Creek watershed, which supports the practice of claiming both sides of a stream.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} is {{dated to}} {{the first half of}} the 4th century and is likely slightly older than Codex Sinaiticus, which was also transcribed in the 4th century.

Another is the slightly more archaic style of Vaticanus, and the complete absence of ornamentation.|$|E
