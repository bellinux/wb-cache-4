5|$|The Spanish Navy hired two salvage {{companies}} to refloat the battleship, but both declined after they surveyed the wreck. Unable to raise her, the Spanish decided to remove as much weight {{as possible from}} España {{in an attempt to}} lighten her to permit refloating. Her guns were removed and dropped overboard <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> later by the salvage vessel Kanguro. The battleship's armor, machinery, and ammunition stores were also removed to lighten her. Her hull was then sealed and partially drained in preparation for raising, but while waiting for the necessary equipment from Italy, several violent storms hit the ship and caused further damage. The battered hull could now no longer be raised, and in November 1924, she broke in half and was abandoned by the Spanish Navy. The 305mm and 102mm guns recovered from España were installed in coastal batteries, some of which remained in service until 1999 before they were retired from service. After the overthrow of King Alfonso XIII, his namesake ship Alfonso XIII, was renamed España in April 1931.|$|E

5|$|The {{very first}} Commando raid– Operation Collar on 23 June 1940– was not {{actually}} carried out by a Commando unit, but by one of their predecessors: No.11 Independent Company. The mission, led by Major Ronnie Tod, was an offensive reconnaissance carried out on the French coast south of Boulogne-sur-Mer and Le Touquet. The operation was a limited success; at least two German soldiers were killed whilst the only British injury was a flesh wound suffered by Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Clarke, who had accompanied the raiders as an observer. A second and similarly inconsequential raid, Operation Ambassador, was made on the German occupied island of Guernsey {{on the night of}} 14 July 1940 by men from H Troop of No. 3 Commando and No. 11 Independent Company. One unit landed on the wrong island and another group disembarked from its launch into water so deep that it came over their heads. Intelligence had indicated that there was a large German barracks on the island but the Commandos found only empty buildings. When they returned to the beach heavy seas had forced their launch offshore, and they were forced to swim out to sea <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
