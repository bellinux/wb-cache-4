5|$|Gandhi based Satyagraha on the Vedantic {{ideal of}} self-realization, ahimsa (nonviolence), vegetarianism, and {{universal}} love. William Borman states that <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> satyagraha {{is rooted in}} the Hindu Upanishadic texts. According to Indira Carr, Gandhi's ideas on ahimsa and satyagraha were founded on the philosophical foundations of Advaita Vedanta. I. Bruce Watson states that some of these ideas are found not only in traditions within Hinduism, but also in Jainism or Buddhism, particularly those about non-violence, vegetarianism and universal love, but Gandhi's synthesis was to politicise these ideas. Gandhi's concept of satya as a civil movement, states Glyn Richards, are best understood {{in the context of the}} Hindu terminology of Dharma and Ṛta.|$|E

25|$|During Savile's lifetime, {{sporadic}} {{allegations of}} child abuse were made against him dating back to 1963, but only became widely publicised after his death. Savile claimed <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> success on Jim'll Fix It had been that he disliked children, although he later admitted to saying this to deflect scrutiny of his personal life. He did not own a computer as {{he did not want}} anybody to think he was downloading child pornography. His autobiography As it Happens (1974, reprinted as Love is an Uphill Thing, 1976) contains admissions of improper sexual conduct which appear to have passed unnoticed during his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Paley's {{recognition}} {{of how to}} harness the potential reach of broadcasting was <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> growing CBS from a tiny chain of stations into what was eventually one of the world's dominant communication empires. During his prime, Paley was described as having an uncanny sense for popular taste and exploiting that insight to build the CBS network. As war clouds darkened over Europe in the late 1930s, Paley recognized Americans' desire for {{news coverage of the}} coming war and built the CBS news division into a dominant force just as he had previously built the network's entertainment division.|$|E
25|$|Moi won {{elections}} in 1992 and 1997, which were marred by political violence on both sides. Moi skilfully exploited Kenya's mix of ethnic tensions in these contests, especially smaller tribes' ever-present fear of domination {{by the larger}} tribes. In {{the absence of an}} effective and organised opposition, Moi had no difficulty in winning. Although it is also suspected that electoral fraud may have occurred, <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> victory in both elections was a divided opposition. He always won the election with a minority vote of about 30% against the opposition who had a combined 70%, which was nonetheless of no consequence because it was subdivided among the opposition who had failed to unite.|$|E

25|$|While much of Alford’s {{interpretation}} {{hinges on}} known parallels in Greek myth, for example Hesiod’s {{tale of the}} battle between the gods and the Titans, <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> theory is his exploration of parallels between Greek and Near Eastern myths. Drawing upon the recent work of scholars such as Walter Burkert, Martin West, and Charles Penglase, Alford suggests that the Greek poets and philosophers borrowed from their Near Eastern neighbours mythical ideas such as: {{the birth of the}} universe in a cataclysm; the fall of the sky; the lowering of 'cities' from heaven to earth; the fall of the golden age; the wars of the gods of heaven and the underworld; the fall of gods, islands and continents from heaven into the underworld or subterranean sea; the birth of all things from the earth or subterranean sea; and the idea that mythical peoples dwelt in heaven, the earth and the underworld.|$|E
500|$|Skelton {{frequently}} {{employed the}} art of pantomime for his characters: a segment of his weekly program was called the [...] "Silent Spot" [...] and the sketch was performed in pantomime.

500|$|The use of {{this new}} tactic by New Zealand meant that Gallaher, the team's wing-forward, was {{repeatedly}} accused by the English of obstruction, though the referee Percy Coles, {{an official of the}} English Rugby Football Union (RFU), rarely penalised him in the Devon match. The Originals' fullback Billy Wallace posited that New Zealand's superior scrum made Gallaher's style of play more prominent. Unlike British and Irish teams of the time, New Zealand employed specialist positions for their forwards. Despite often facing an extra man in the scrum, the New Zealanders [...] "drove like a cleaver through British forward packs". Gallaher later said: [...] "I think my play is fairI sincerely trust soand surely the fact that both Mr Percy Coles and Mr D. H. Bowentwo of the referees of our matches, and fairly representative of English and Welsh ideas, have taken no exception so it ought to have some weight." [...] The British press, looking to find fault in New Zealand's play, continued to criticise Gallaher throughout the tour. Gallaher believed <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> side's success was a difference in playing styles, while Winston McCarthy believed the unique backline formation to be a major factor.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{explained}} <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> changeup {{was how he}} pinched {{the seam}} of the ball with his {{thumb and index finger}} as he released it. He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball looked the same to the batter. His changeup ranged from 73–76mph. Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said of Hoffman's changeup: [...] "He pitched so well off his fastball [...] couldn't just sit on it every pitch." [...] "You could be sitting on [...] and still not be successful with it", says former player Mark Sweeney. It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years. With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode. [...] "Some [...] fool you. Some guys overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", said former rival and later teammate Mike Piazza. After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, [...] "It's like it has a parachute on it." [...] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup. He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret. [...] "I was a little weird about it", Hoffman said. [...] "I didn't like talking about how I threw the change. I didn't want people to see how I gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." [...] Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone had seen it.|$|E
