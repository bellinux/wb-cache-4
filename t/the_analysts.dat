25|$|Modern {{nuclear physics}} and {{particle}} physics experiments often involve {{large numbers of}} data analysts working together to extract quantitative data from complex datasets. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>analysts</b> want to report accurate systematic error estimates for all of their measurements; this is difficult or impossible {{if one of the}} errors is observer bias. To remove this bias, the experimenters devise blind analysis techniques, where the experimental result is hidden from <b>the</b> <b>analysts</b> until they've agreed—based on properties of the data set other than the final value—that the analysis techniques are fixed.|$|E

40|$|Disruptions in psychoanalytic work go by {{many names}} {{depending}} on the theory and the alleged source of the problem. Transferences originate within the analysand and may shatter cooperative engagement with <b>the</b> <b>analyst.</b> Problematic countertransferences are contributed by <b>the</b> <b>analyst,</b> {{as a reflection of}} projective identification orchestrated by the patient or of <b>the</b> <b>analyst's</b> transferences. Unsettling enacted unconscious scenarios originate primarily in <b>the</b> <b>analyst,</b> analysand or both. An intersubjective perspective has each partner influencing and deflecting the other. Their individual contributions are inseparable. A point of view emphasizing discontinuity in experience substitutes dissociation for repression. <b>The</b> <b>analyst</b> represents a way of being that is foreign to the patient's sense of self. <b>The</b> <b>analyst</b> may be invested with dissociated aspects of the analysand's self. In either case the analysand assiduously resists joining with <b>the</b> <b>analyst.</b> <b>The</b> point is that disruptions are complex events with hard to separate contributions by analyst and analysand.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{questions}} whether {{the body of}} <b>the</b> <b>analyst</b> may be helpfully conceptualized as an embodied feature of the setting and suggests {{that this may be}} especially helpful for understanding patients who develop a symbiotic transference and for whom any variance in <b>the</b> <b>analyst's</b> body is felt to be profoundly destabilizing. In such cases the patient needs to relate to the body of <b>the</b> <b>analyst</b> concretely and exclusively as a setting 'constant' and its meaning for the patient may thus remain inaccessible to analysis for a long time. When the separateness of the body of <b>the</b> <b>analyst</b> reaches <b>the</b> patient's awareness because of changes in <b>the</b> <b>analyst's</b> appearance or bodily state, it then mobilizes primitive anxieties in the patient. It is only when the body of <b>the</b> <b>analyst</b> can become a dynamic variable between them (i. e. part of the process) that it can be used by the patient to further the exploration of their own mind. ...|$|R
500|$|United States {{officials}} said that [...] "one of the few effective elements of the 's military" [...] was air defence, with <b>the</b> <b>analysts</b> crediting the SA-11 Buk-1M with shooting down a Tupolev-22M bomber and contributing {{to the loss of}} some Su-25s. This view was supported by independent Russian analysis. Colonel-General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, Russian deputy chief of general staff, said the Soviet-made Tor and Buk anti-aircraft missile systems, bought by Georgia from Ukraine, were responsible for downing Russian aircraft during the war. A Russian assessment, reported by Roger McDermott, said that Russian losses would have been significantly higher if the Georgians had not left behind a portion of their Buk-M1 systems near Senaki in western Georgia and several Osa missile launchers in South Ossetia. According to some reports, Georgia also possessed a battery of the Israeli-made SPYDER-SR short-range self-propelled anti-aircraft system. The Georgian air-defence early-warning and command-control tactical system was connected via Turkey to a NATO Air Situation Data Exchange (ASDE), which provided Georgia with intelligence during the conflict.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how {{to provide}} information acquisition and truthful reporting incentives to a financial analyst who privately trades on own account.

For every signal, <b>the</b> <b>analyst</b> makes <b>the</b> report that corresponds to the portfolio endowment with maximum market value, given security prices. The principal cannot make <b>the</b> <b>analyst</b> strictly prefer to report the true signal: <b>the</b> <b>analyst</b> is truthful only when indifferent between the two reports. <b>The</b> <b>analyst's</b> information acquisition incentive is driven only by private portfolio considerations: he acquires information only if he will be holding a large enough position in the stock he covers. The paper also presents a general "separation of the optimal report from private information" result and illustrates that performance based reward schemes can fail to induce any information revelation when <b>the</b> <b>analyst</b> privately trades. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{light of}} current debates between {{classical}} and intersubjective schools of psychoanalysis, the challenge {{posed by the}} latter to such basic concepts as <b>the</b> <b>analyst’s</b> neutrality, anonymity, and abstinence is taken up. It is maintained that the term neutral position is today more germane and meaningful than the term neutrality, which frequently has been taken to prescribe <b>the</b> <b>analyst’s</b> posture. It is proposed that for each patient the neutral position is uniquely sited {{and that it is}} incumbent on <b>the</b> <b>analyst</b> to find its location. The neutral position is defined within the context of <b>the</b> interaction between <b>analyst</b> and patient. <b>The</b> concept is therefore compatible with—indeed it is essential to—an intersubjective or relational orientation. The manifold reasons, conscious and unconscious, why <b>the</b> <b>analyst</b> is vulnerable to leaving the neutral position are considered. The patient’s reaction to <b>the</b> <b>analyst</b> who has left the neutral position and <b>the</b> <b>analyst’s</b> clinical use of this reaction are discussed. T here is today abundant skepticism about the notions of neu-trality, anonymity, and abstinence, to the point that certain enact-ments have begun to be regarded as being of value, or even essential, to the psychoanalytic process. Regardless, however, of whether an analyst’s minimal enactments are inevitable, I believe that to emphasize mainly their usefulness and/or <b>the</b> <b>analyst’s</b> irreducible subjectivity (Renik 1993) is to sidestep the fact that <b>the</b> <b>analyst</b> has failed <b>the</b> patient, at least partially, even if in some hands such failures can be turned to the patient’s advantage...|$|R
