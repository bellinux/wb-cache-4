Wildness {{has been a problem}} for him, though, and his fastball is easy to hit when <b>thrown</b> over the plate. In the past, he has <b>thrown</b> a splitter and a curveball.|$|E
5|$|On 29November, {{the crew}} {{assembled}} {{to consider the}} proposal {{that some of the}} slaves should be <b>thrown</b> overboard. James Kelsall later claimed that he had disagreed with the plan at first but it was soon unanimously agreed. On 29November, 54women and children were <b>thrown</b> through cabin windows into the sea. On 1December, 42male slaves were <b>thrown</b> overboard, and 36more followed in the next few days. Another ten, in a display of defiance at the inhumanity of the slavers, jumped into the sea. Having heard the shrieks of the victims as they were <b>thrown</b> into the water, one slave requested that the remaining Africans be denied all food and drink rather than be <b>thrown</b> into the sea. The crew ignored this request. In total, 132 Africans were killed by the time the ship reached the Caribbean. The account of the King's Bench trial reports that one slave managed to climb back onto the ship.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>throws</b> {{are named}} by {{describing}} the circumvention {{point of the}} <b>throw</b> (e.g., hip <b>throw,</b> shoulder <b>throw,</b> wrist <b>throw</b> etc.), or the nature of effect of the <b>throw</b> on the opponent (e.g., heaven and earth <b>throw,</b> valley drop, body drop) with variations are given descriptive names.

It is conventional for the Japanese to name their <b>throws</b> in this manner, and many western martial art dojos have given English names to the <b>throws</b> feeling that {{it is easier for}} English speaking students to remember the names of <b>throws</b> if they can associate the <b>throws</b> by the descriptive nature of the <b>throw</b> name.|$|R

5|$|Executive {{producer}} R. W. Goodwin recalls {{being on}} {{location for the}} episode's opening scene, in which Detective Barbala is <b>thrown</b> from a window. The room used for the scene had two windows side-by-side, and one had been replaced with sugar glass for the stunt. When the false window was blown out to simulate someone being <b>thrown</b> through it, the crew found that the glass window beside the false one had also accidentally been blown out. The episode's key grip, Al Campbell, suggested that the next shot show Barbala's dog lying beside his body to explain the second window breaking.|$|E
5|$|Facilities at Giant's Grave improved, and {{included}} jetties to enable ships' ballast to be landed and dumped, {{rather than being}} <b>thrown</b> overboard. This latter approach had caused problems at Newport for the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal, where ballast had been <b>thrown</b> into the river, and at Cardiff for the Glamorganshire Canal, {{where it had been}} <b>thrown</b> into the canal basin. Efforts were also made to improve the facilities at Neath. From 1818, a Harbour Board was established, and banks of copper slag, marked with buoys, were used to confine the channel. This enabled ships of over 300 tons to reach Neath quays on spring tides, although on neap tides Giant's Grave still had to be used. From 1824, when the connection to the Tennant Canal opened, much of the trade crossed the river and passed down the western bank to the port of Swansea.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{availability}} of the simplified tasks for the step-by-step practice of the judo <b>throwing</b> techniques. Participants were 12 college students who have attended the national College judo tournaments and the 16 principal <b>throwing</b> techniques were employed for the experiments. The simplified tasks of the <b>throwing</b> techniques were designed based on the opponent’s postures that were one knee and half sitting. Participants were asked to <b>throw</b> the opponents who assumed two kinds of the postures by 16 <b>throwing</b> techniques. 4 kinds of Taisabaki, which meant how to move legs, were used for the <b>throwing</b> trials. Binomial tests were conducted and results demonstrated that both the <b>throwing</b> tasks to one knee and the <b>throwing</b> tasks to half sitting were available for 9 <b>throwing</b> techniques. Neither the <b>throwing</b> tasks to one knee nor the <b>throwing</b> tasks to half sitting were available for 2 <b>throwing</b> techniques. The <b>throwing</b> tasks to one knee were not available, but the <b>throwing</b> tasks to half-sitting were available for 5 <b>throwing</b> techniques. Furthermore, appropriate Taisabaki was considered for each of the <b>throwing</b> techniques. The findings of this study would contribute to devise appropriate ways and means of judo practice for novices...|$|R
