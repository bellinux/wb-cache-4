We first describe recent trends in shopping travel, based on recent <b>travel</b> <b>statistics.</b> We then seek, through the transportation and marketing literatures, different approaches to the question of why people travel to stores. This leads us to pose specific hypotheses about shopping-related trips which we then test using activity-based demand modeling. Our results suggest that the behaviors associated with the adoption of electronic home shopping are complex and that it is naive to view home shopping as just another channel. Home shopping will not evolve independently of other changes in work, daily routines and leisure time use...|$|E

40|$|The dynamic spatial {{redistribution}} of individuals {{is a key}} driving force of various spatiotemporal phenomena on geographical scales. It can synchronise populations of interacting species, stabilise them, and diversify gene pools [1 - 3]. Human travelling, e. g. {{is responsible for the}} geographical spread of human infectious disease [4 - 9]. In the light of increasing international trade, intensified human mobility and an imminent influenza A epidemic [10] the knowledge of dynamical and statistical properties of human travel is thus of fundamental importance. Despite its crucial role, a quantitative assessment of these properties on geographical scales remains elusive and the assumption that humans disperse diffusively still prevails in models. Here we report on a solid and quantitative assessment of human <b>travelling</b> <b>statistics</b> by analysing the circulation of bank notes in the United States. Based on a comprehensive dataset of over a million individual displacements we find that dispersal is anomalous in two ways. First, the distribution of travelling distances decays as a power law, indicating that trajectories of bank notes are reminiscent of scale free random walks known as Levy flights. Secondly, the probability of remaining in a small, spatially confined region for a time T is dominated by algebraically long tails which attenuate the superdiffusive spread. We show that human travelling behaviour can be described mathematically on many spatiotemporal scales by a two parameter continuous time random walk model to a surprising accuracy and conclude that human travel on geographical scales is an ambivalent effectively superdiffusive process...|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} and travel mobility {{have been recognized}} by the public as livability {{and quality of life}} concerns for decades. In good economic times, traffic congestion was ranked {{as one of the top}} five problems in many metro regions. Transportation funding increases over the last decade have often been tied to a specific set of projects designed to reduce or slow the growth of congestion. So why do some transportation professionals suggest that congestion is unimportant?

Specifically, we use query volume to forecast opening weekend box-office revenue for feature films, first month sales of video games, and the rank of songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In all cases that we consider, we find that search counts are indicative of future outcomes, but when compared with baseline models trained on publicly available data, the performance boost associated with search counts is generally modest—a pattern that, as we show, also applies to previous work on tracking flu trends. We conclude that in the absence of other data sources, or where small improvements in predictive performance are material, search queries may provide a useful guide to the near future...|$|E

Many larger companies and public authorities therefore attempt to implement policies, regulations and standardized routines for their travel. The concept of travel management describes such activities pursued on a professional basis, by employed travel managers. The purpose of this report is to investigate travel management in Sweden and, in particular, to examine business travel by train in relation to professional travel management. The report mainly draws on interviews with travel managers, but empirical data also include interviews with sales personnel at travel agencies and at SJ (the state-owned Swedish railway company), interviews with frequent business travellers, and travel policy documents. To begin with, six important tasks for a travel manager are identified: 1) developing and implementing a travel policy, 2) cooperating with a travel agency, 3) making agreements with suppliers, 4) creating standardized payment routines, 5) collecting and analyzing <b>travel</b> <b>statistics,</b> and 6) communicating and gaining support within the organization. These different tasks are then described and analyzed in some detail, and specific attention is given to how the railway as a transport system works {{in relation to the}} practice of travel management.

However, their influence on the economy, environment, traffic performance, infrastructure, and safety are much more significant than their diminutive numerical presence suggests. This dissertation describes the development and prototype implementation of a new highfidelity inductive loop sensor and a ground-breaking commercial vehicle classification system based on the vehicle inductive signatures obtained from this sensor technology. This new sensor technology is relatively easy to install and has the potential to yield reliable and highly detailed vehicle inductive signatures for advanced traffic surveillance applications. The Speed PRofile INterpolation Temporal-Spatial (SPRINTS) transformation model developed in this dissertation improves vehicle signature data quality under adverse traffic conditions where acceleration and deceleration effects can distort inductive vehicle signatures. The axle classification model enables commercial vehicles to be classified accurately by their axle configuration. The body classification models reveal the function and unique impacts of the drive and trailer units of each commercial vehicle. Together, the results reveal the significant potential of this inductive sensor technology in providing a more comprehensive commercial vehicle data profile based on a unique ability to extract both axle configuration information as well as high fidelity undercarriage profiles within a single sensor technology to provide richer insight on commercial vehicle <b>travel</b> <b>statistics.</b> Civil and Environmental Engineering...|$|E

Due to the lack of actual data, only the <b>travel</b> <b>statistics</b> of traditional fuel vehicles, along with information from a small number of EVs and some traffic flow information are available to model probabilistic EV charging. Additionally, the queuing theory, stochastic probability method, etc. [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], are used to simulate EV driving and charging characteristics. For example, a traffic flow integrated model was used to stimulate the mobile charging load for CS planning in [1]. The large scale adoption of EVs will have a great influence on transportation and power industries. In addition, the traditional methods, which can be used to calculate the charging load, were primarily from a macro perspective, but it is not convincing when performing CS planning for a specific road, as an example. In this case, the charging demand is highly related to road conditions, traffic flow, different behaviors of different types of vehicles and the remaining power available in different time periods. The number and behaviors of EVs are not experimentally known so far due to the relative scarcity of EVs on the road. It is hard to simulate the charging demand un-constructed by using conventional methods when the real data is absent, which is supposed to be used to provide guidance for charging load assessment of the candidate CS deployments.|$|E

These migration and commuting data sets are large and complex, differing from the area statistics {{by virtue of the}} fact that they involve two geographies – one of origin and the other of destination. WICID, the web-based software system developed to provide the user interface to the Special Migration Statistics (SMS) and the Special Workplace Statistics (SWS) from the 1991 Census, has now been upgraded to allow registered users of census data to extract subsets of the 2001 interaction data sets. These include 2001 SMS and SWS as well as a new set of Special <b>Travel</b> <b>Statistics</b> (STS) for flows in Scotland. The data sets are different from those in 1991, not least because aggregate flow counts are available at the scale of output areas, as well as wards and districts, and because the method of data adjustment to eliminate the risk of disclosure is different from that used in 1991.

Forecasts from a national four-step model system, based on Revealed Preference data, which did not cover explanatory factors like mode concept, comfort, mode image, was made and compared with a forecast based on stated preference data choice model. Both type of forecasts were compared to <b>travel</b> <b>statistics.</b> Stated Preference data have been collected from car drivers, coach and train passengers. The set of improvements have been included in the SP alternatives presented to the subjects. A structured logit model, a regression model and a linear programming model are compared. Unstructured and structured logit models are compared. Logit models have been estimated and used to form a mode choice model which predicts the changes in market shares between the train and car. The choice model forecast coincide, accidentally, with actual demand 8 - 9 months after the introduction of the set of improvements (a 40 % increase in journeys). The set of improvements, including the new train service, has proven to be a success with more than 100 % increase in travel after only two years of operation. Differences in estimated logit models for 1991 and 1992 are explained as partly due to asymmetry effects and partly to shortcomings in the SP data collection technique. Logit model estimates for train and coach are compared. The value of high standard coach service, running in parallel to the train, is estimated. The new coach gained few new passengers and also a much lower monetary value than the train by both train and bus passengers. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Malaria is a {{notifiable}} {{disease in}} the Netherlands, a non-endemic country. Imported malaria infections occur regularly among travellers, migrants and visitors. Surveillance data were analysed from 2008 to 2015. Trends in amounts of notifications among risk groups were analysed using Poisson regression. For asylum seekers, yearly incidence was calculated per region of origin, using national asylum request statistics as denominator data. For tourists, denominator data were used from <b>travel</b> <b>statistics</b> to estimate incidence per travel region up to 2012. Results: A modest increase in overall imported malaria notifications occurred in 2008 - 2015 (from 222 in 2008 to 344 in 2015). Notably, in 2014 and 2015 sharp increases were seen in malaria among travellers {{visiting friends and relatives}} (VFR), and in asylum seekers. Of all Plasmodium falciparum infections, most (1254 / 1337; 93. 8 %) were imported from Africa; 1037 / 1337 (77. 6 %) were imported from Central and West Africa. Malaria in VFR was mostly caused by P. falciparum infection after visiting Ghana (22 %) or Nigeria (19 %). Malaria in asylum seekers was mostly caused by Plasmodium vivax infection from the Horn of Africa. The large number of notifications in asylum seekers resulted from both an increase in number of asylum seekers and a striking increase of malaria incidence in this group. Incidence of malaria in asylum seekers from the Horn of Africa ranged between 0. 02 and 0. 3 % in 2008 - 2013, but rose to 1. 6 % in 2014 and 1. 3 % in 2015. In 2008 - 2012, incidence in tourists visiting Central and West Africa dropped markedly. Conclusions: Imported malaria is on the rise again in the Netherlands, most notably since 2013. This is mostly due to immigration of asylum seekers from the Horn of Africa. The predominance of P. vivax infection among asylum seekers warrants vigilance in health workers when a migrant presents with fever, as relapses of this type of malaria can occur long after arrival in the Netherland...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Confirmed H 1 N 1 cases during {{late spring}} and summer 2009 in various {{countries}} showed a substantial age shift between importations and local transmission cases, with adults mainly responsible for seeding unaffected regions and children most frequently driving community outbreaks. METHODS: We introduce a multi-host stochastic metapopulation model with two age classes to analytically investigate {{the role of a}} heterogeneously mixing population and its associated non-homogeneous travel behaviors on the risk of a major epidemic. We inform the model with demographic data, contact data and <b>travel</b> <b>statistics</b> of Europe and Mexico, and calibrate it to the 2009 H 1 N 1 pandemic early outbreak. We allow for variations of the model parameters to explore the conditions of invasion under different scenarios. RESULTS: We derive the expression for the potential of global invasion of the epidemic that depends on the transmissibility of the pathogen, the transportation network and mobility features, the demographic profile and the mixing pattern. Higher assortativity in the contact pattern greatly increases the probability of spatial containment of the epidemic, this effect being contrasted by an increase in the social activity of adults vs. children. Heterogeneous features of the mobility network characterizing its topology and traffic flows strongly favor the invasion of the pathogen at the spatial level, as also a larger fraction of children traveling. Variations in the demographic profile and mixing habits across countries lead to heterogeneous outbreak situations. Model results are compatible with the H 1 N 1 spatial transmission dynamics observed. CONCLUSIONS: This work illustrates the importance of considering age-dependent mixing profiles and mobility features coupled together to study the conditions for the spatial invasion of an emerging influenza pandemic. Its results allow the immediate assessment of the risk of a major epidemic for a specific scenario upon availability of data, and the evaluation of the potential effectiveness of public health interventions targeting specific age groups, their interactions and mobility behaviors.

When it comes to travel, in 2010, Mexico was the most visited country by Americans, with Italy ranking fifth and Spain ranking tenth. The second and third most visited countries by Americans were Canada and the United Kingdom, respectively, both English speaking countries. Based on student interest and <b>travel</b> <b>statistics,</b> Spanish and Italian could be considered very worthwhile of study in the United States. What if the efforts put into studying the Spanish language could result in competency in communicating in the Italian language as well? By developing intercomprehension skills in students, this is an outcome that is very possible to achieve. Intercomprehension {{has been defined as}} the process of developing the ability to coconstruct meaning {{in the context of the}} encounter of different languages, and to make pragmatic use of this in a concrete communicative situation. This thesis provides several suggestions on how to teach Spanish and Italian in such a way that facilitates intercomprehension between the two languages. This thesis suggests using mutual intelligibility as a key factor in selecting lexical items and phrases to teach students. This sometimes will entail the teaching of a less commonly used word or phrase that is more mutually intelligible than the common word or phrase, resulting in increased intercomprehension success. The foreign language textbooks Oggi in Italia and ??Claro Que S??!, as well as the Kindle electronic travel phrasebook guides Language for Travelers-Spanish and Language for Travelers- Italian, are utilized to illustrate how the vocabulary and phrases provided by these resources could be modified in order to facilitate intercomprehension. In addition to modifying vocabulary and phrases to be instructed in language courses that seek to promote intercomprehension, charts indicate how pronunciation can be modified depending on whether one is communicating with a Spanish or an Italian speaker, in order to increase intercomprehension. This thesis also provides charts illustrating common morphological differences that exist in areas such as plural formation and infinitives. In addition, this thesis demonstrates how gestures can be a useful tool in making less mutually intelligible words comprehensible. Lastly, this thesis argues for the importance of multilingualism and suggests populations of students that could greatly benefit from the development of intercomprehension skills...|$|E

50|$|Community gardens may {{be found}} in neighborhoods, schools, hospitals, and on {{residential}} housing grounds. The location of a community garden is a critical factor in how often the community garden is used and who visits it. Exposure to a community garden is much more likely for an individual if they are able to walk or drive to the location, as opposed to public transportation. The length of travel time is also a factor. Those who live within a 15-minute or less travel distance are more likely to visit a community garden as compared to those with a longer <b>travel</b> time. Such <b>statistics</b> should be taken into consideration when choosing a location for a community garden for a target population.|$|R
5000|$|FIFA {{proposes that}} {{no more than one}} city may use two stadiums, and the number of host cities is limited between eight and ten. However, FIFA {{subsequently}} accepted the Brazilian Football Confederation's suggestion to use twelve host cities in [...] "the interest of the whole country". The twelve selections - each the capital of its state - cover all the main regions of Brazil and create more evenly distributed hosting than the 1950 finals in Brazil provided, when matches were concentrated in the south-east and south. Consequently, the tournament will require significant long-distance <b>travel</b> for teams. <b>Statistics</b> show that nearly 10 million passengers used around 20 Brazilian airports in 31 days of the football World Cup.|$|R
