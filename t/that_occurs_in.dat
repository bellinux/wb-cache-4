5|$|Although {{dopamine}} {{is normally}} {{broken down by}} an oxidoreductase enzyme, it is also susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen, yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products.

5|$|Although {{far less}} common than other metallo{{proteins}} (e.g. those of zinc and iron), cobaltoproteins are known aside from B12. These proteins include methionine aminopeptidase 2, an enzyme <b>that</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> humans and other mammals {{that does not}} use the corrin ring of B12, but binds cobalt directly. Another non-corrin cobalt enzyme is nitrile hydratase, an enzyme in bacteria that metabolize nitriles.|$|E
5|$|An Atlantic {{hurricane}} or {{tropical storm}} is a tropical cyclone that {{forms in the}} Atlantic Ocean, usually in the summer or fall.

5|$|Chiral phases {{usually have}} a helical {{twisting}} of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is {{on the order of}} the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting <b>that</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as polarization filters.|$|E

5|$|Lightning is an {{electrical}} discharge <b>that</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> a thunderstorm. It {{can be seen}} in the form of a bright streak (or bolt) from the sky.

When a large enough charge is built up, a large discharge will occur and can be seen as lightning.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus manavi (Manavi long-fingered bat) is a bat in {{the genus}} Miniopterus <b>that</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> east-central Madagascar. First {{described}} in 1906, this species was later {{included in the}} mainland African M.minor. A 1995 revision united populations of small Miniopterus from Madagascar and the Comoros as M.manavi, but molecular and morphological studies in 2008 and 2009 showed that this concept of M.manavi in fact included five different species. M.manavi itself was restricted to a few locations in the eastern Central Highlands and populations in the Comoros and northern and western Madagascar were allocated to different species.|$|E

5|$|A {{wildfire}} or {{wildland fire}} is {{a fire in}} an area of combustible vegetation <b>that</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> the countryside or rural area. Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago. Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.|$|E

5|$|Any {{of these}} {{conditions}} <b>that</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> a family can indicate a diagnosis of Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, though it is only confirmed by a genetic test for a mutation in the FLCN gene, which codes for the protein folliculin. Though its function is not fully understood, {{it appears to be}} a tumor suppressor gene that restricts cell growth and division. Versions of FLCN have been found in other animals, including fruit flies, German shepherds, rats, and mice. The disease was discovered in 1977, but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002, after kidney cancer, collapsed lungs, and pulmonary cysts were all definitively connected to BHD.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling <b>that</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E
5|$|Olympic {{sports are}} governed by {{international}} sports federations (IFs) recognised by the IOC as the global supervisors of those sports. There are 35 federations represented at the IOC.
