40|$|The Public Sickness Insurance Act (Act no. 187 / 2006 Coll.) which {{replaced}} the existing fragmented law regulations governing the subsystem {{of the public}} sickness insurance regime in the Czech Republic became effective as of 1 January 2009. The new law regulations {{in the field of}} public sickness insurance was expected to bring, among other aspects, a higher motivation of employees and employers for reduction of the events of unjustified <b>temporary</b> work <b>incapacity.</b> The main aim of the Bachelors Dissertation was to find out whether the new law regulation fulfilled the intents and whether the rate of <b>temporary</b> work <b>incapacity</b> of employees decreased and whether the average duration of <b>temporary</b> work <b>incapacity</b> in the Region of South Bohemia dropped in comparison with the situation before 1 January 2009. While drawing up the Bachelors Dissertation, the author used a quantitative research and statistical data analysis. It implied from the results found that the hypothesis "The number of <b>temporary</b> work <b>incapacities</b> in the Region of South Bohemia dropped in comparison with the situation before 1 January 2009 was confirmed. The fulfilment of the hypothesis is correlated with the legislators intent in this area because its fulfilment was intended in the objectives of the new law regulations. The implementation of the new Public Sickness Insurance Act led to a significant reduction of the number of cases of <b>temporary</b> work <b>incapacity.</b> On the basis of the analysis of the data acquired it was proven that the time of duration of one <b>temporary</b> work <b>incapacity</b> was extended in all districts of the Region of South Bohemia. The hypothesis "The average time of <b>temporary</b> work <b>incapacity</b> in the Region of South Bohemia dropped in comparison with the situation before 1 January 2009 was not confirmed. The results of the Dissertation indicate that the adoption of the new law regulation system of public sickness insurance led to the system stabilisation, elimination of undesired trends in the sickness insurance system, limitation of misuse of benefits, involvement of treating physicians and employers in the reduction of the number of cases of <b>temporary</b> work <b>incapacity.</b> The implementation of the new law regulations managed to achieve this objective. Therefore the results found can be used by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs as a certain form of feedback relating to implementation of the new law regulation of the public sickness benefit insurance system and the professional public...|$|R

Data on sickness absence and disability spells for the population of older workers come from the Danish administrative registers for 1998 - 2002. We generally find an independent role of both education and occupation on <b>temporary</b> work <b>incapacity</b> only. Having at least primary education reduces women's (men's) probability of <b>temporary</b> work <b>incapacity</b> by 16 % (38 %) while working in a physically demanding job increases it by 37 % (26 %). On the other hand, conditional on sickness absence, the effects of education and occupation on permanent work incapacity are generally insignificant...|$|R

40|$|The {{area of a}} {{sickness}} insurance, I have chosen for my diploma thesis, is not only important for me {{in terms of my}} working life, but as well as for my private life, because a <b>temporary</b> working <b>incapacity</b> and a title for sickness insurance benefits accompanies a life of each of us, either directly in our family circle or among friends or colleagues. The working incapacity, as a social event, is familiar to all of us. Someone meets it more often, someone less often, however it always influences our private as well as working life from a financial perspective, it has an impact on our working duties and it strikes our family groove. At the same time it has a very human dimension, since it concerns the most valuable we have ? it is our health. It deepens solidarity among people, mutual support and empathy. I have chosen the above topic also for the reason that I had already been working {{in the area of the}} sickness insurance for five years. I am interested whether there have been met the main objectives from the new legislation especially in terms of savings in financial means, a decrease of a number of <b>temporary</b> <b>incapacities</b> and a prevention of a misusage of the <b>temporary</b> working <b>incapacities.</b> The main aim of this thesis is to analyze individual areas of an implementation of the sickness insurance and on the basis of obtained results and statistical data to evaluate whether the main objectives of the sickness insurance legislation from January 1 st, 2009 in the region of Jindřichův Hradec were met. Three hypotheses were presented in the thesis. The first premise said that with the effectiveness of this law financial means had spent on the sickness insurance benefits had been saved. The second premise was a decrease of the <b>temporary</b> <b>incapacities</b> and the third proven one was the meeting of the main objectives of the legislation in the whole implementation range of the sickness insurance in the region of Jindřichův Hradec. Two research methods were chosen; an analysis of documents, a technique of a secondary analysis and a content analysis. The second method was a semi-structured interview with professionals in the area of the sickness insurance. Defined hypotheses were confirmed by the carried out research. Financial means spent on the sickness insurance benefits were saved very dramatically already in the first half of the effectiveness of this law and the number of <b>temporary</b> <b>incapacities</b> decreased by one third of cases in that period. The third hypothesis was also confirmed by both chosen research methods and defined objectives of the new legislation were met in the region of Jindřichův Hradec. The defined aims of the diploma thesis were achieved, hypotheses were verified, there were mentioned important remarks and changes and provisions, which would lead to another streamlining of the sickness insurance system, were proposed. The obtained results are beneficial for my work in this area and they are a motivation as well as a challenge to other research activities...|$|R

50|$|For a {{long time}} it was unclear that the defence of <b>temporary</b> non-pathological {{criminal}} <b>incapacity</b> was at all different from the defence of sane automatism, and (if so) what the difference was. This question was finally resolved by the SCA in S v Eadie. Eadie had battered a fellow motorist {{to death with a}} broken hockey stick in a fit of purported road rage. He had been drinking heavily. He raised the defence of <b>temporary</b> non-pathological criminal <b>incapacity,</b> but this defence was rejected. On conviction, he appealed to the SCA. In a judgment “long and very thorough,” Navsa JA comprehensively reviewed the jurisprudence on provocation and emotional stress, and the historical development of the defences of <b>temporary</b> non-pathological criminal <b>incapacity</b> and sane automatism. He concluded that they {{are one and the same}} thing. He went on to hold that a normal person can only lack self-control, and hence criminal capacity, if he is acting in a state of automatism. He also indicated that, although the test of capacity might still remain, in principle, essentially subjective, the application of this test is to be approached with caution. The courts must not too readily accept the ipse dixit of the accused regarding provocation or emotional stress. A court is entitled to draw a legitimate inference from what “hundreds of thousands” of other people would have done under the same circumstances: that is, by looking at the objective circumstances. Drawing such an inference could result in the court’s disbelieving an accused who says simply, without adducing any further evidence, that he lacked capacity or acted involuntarily under provocation or emotional stress.|$|R

In the end, the McKenzie protocol proved to be superior to the Williams program in terms of pain relief, lumbar mobility and number of sessions needed to recover. Another finding was that the two programs are not totally contradictory, but they are just applied in different stages of the LBP syndrome, depending on several anatomical and pathological factors...|$|R
50|$|S v Laubscher {{dealt with}} the defence of <b>temporary</b> non-pathological {{criminal}} <b>incapacity.</b> Laubscher, a medical student, shot and killed his father-in-law, and attempted also to shoot his mother-in-law and his estranged wife one day at his in-laws’ home. He was charged with and convicted of murder and attempted murder. His defence {{was that he had}} acted involuntarily, since he had lacked criminal capacity {{at the time of the}} commission. This was due to a total but temporary “psychological breakdown,” or temporary “disintegration of his personality.” In order to address the issue of the appellant’s mental faculties at the time of the crime, the court had to look at the role of the defence in South African law. To be criminally liable, a perpetrator must, at the time of the commission of the alleged offence, have criminal liability. The doctrine of criminal capacity is an independent subdivision of the concept of mens rea. Therefore, to be criminally liable, a perpetrator’s mental faculties must be such that he is legally to blame for his conduct.|$|R

The size of the liability is differentiated for different categories of employees: for persons on executive and managing positions- three times the monthly remuneration; {{for the rest of the}} employees - no more than the amount of the monthly remuneration [...]In cases of limited liability, the employer issues an order in which he determines the basis and amount of the liability of the employee (Art. 210 of the LC).

40|$|SummaryIntroductionSeptic knee {{arthritis}} following arthroscopy {{is a rare}} but dreaded complication: {{it might}} compromise patients’ functional prognosis and engage surgeon's liability. This study analyzes the context of such infection occurrences, their management {{as well as their}} medicolegal consequences. Patients and methodsTwenty-two cases of knee septic arthritis following arthroscopy were examined during the medicolegal litigation process and collected for assessment from a medical liability specialised insurer. Half of the patients were manual workers who worked on their knees, and seven knees had a previous surgical history. The procedures performed at arthroscopy included seven ligamentoplasties, nine meniscotomies, three arthroscopic lavages, one arthrolysis, one chondroma removal and one plica resection. Seven patients, to some point, received corticosteroids: three preoperative joint injections, three intraoperative injections, and one oral corticotherapy. ResultsClinical signs of septic arthritis appeared after a median interval of 8 days (0 – 37), twice after a hemarthrosis and once after an articular burn. The median delay before treatment initiation was 4. 2 days, and in 10 cases this therapeutic delay exceeded 3 days. On average, 3. 5 additional procedures (1 – 9) were required to treat the infection and its residual sequels. Two total knee prostheses were implanted. Only two patients were free of disabling sequellae, and in five patients these sequels affected their livelihood. The medicolegal consequences were a partially permanent disability averaging 5 % (0 – 20), a total <b>temporary</b> work <b>incapacity</b> of 120 days (40 – 790), a suffering burden averaging 3 out of 7 (0 – 4, 5) points on the scale conventionally used in France. Twelve of these legal claims led to court ordered patient compensation. DiscussionSome risk factors of articular infection are known and well-identified. They can be linked to the patient's condition (addiction to smoking, surgical history, professional activity) or to medical management (intra-articular corticoid injections, interventions under oral anticoagulants, inadvertently overheated irrigation fluid). When infection is suspected, it is often the needle-aspirated fluid's inappropriate handling (such as absence of bacteriological testing or defective waiting time for the results), which delays the diagnostic or therapeutic management of this complication. All failures of infection diagnosis or treatment heavily contribute to malpractice claims against the surgeon. Early and appropriate management of postoperative infections helps limiting the risk of functional sequellae for the patient and reduces the risk of malpractice litigation for the practitioner.

40|$|Labour law in South Africa {{has evolved}} {{over the past century}} at an ever {{increasing}} pace. The establishment of a democratic government in 1995 has been the trigger for a large number of labour law statutes being promulgated, particularly with reference to the laws governing the employment relationship and dismissal. From very humble and employer biased dispute resolution application under the common law of contract, labour law in this country has evolved through the various acts culminating in a labour law system which is highly regulated and codified. Dismissal for medical incapacity in this treatise is reviewed with regard to the applicable statutes and the various codes of good practice as the law has evolved and developed from the period covered by the common law through that covered by the 1995 LRA up to and including the current period. Particular attention is paid to both substantive and procedural requirements as well as the remedies applicable under the different legal regimes and the pertinent tribunals and courts. Regard is also given to the duration and causes of incapacity and the effect this may have on the applicable remedy applied by these tribunals. It will become apparant that the medically incapacitated employee occupied a relatively weak and vulnerable position under the common law as opposed to the current position under the 1995 LRA. The influence of the remedies applied by the tribunals under the 1956 LRA are clearly evident in the current regulations and codes under the 1995 LRA which contain specific statutory provisions for employees not to be unfairly dismissed. Distinctions are drawn between permissible and impermissible dismissals, with medical incapacity falling under the former. Furthermore, a distinction is drawn statutorily between permanent and <b>temporary</b> illhealth/injury <b>incapacity</b> with detailed guidelines for substantive and procedural fairness requirements to be met by employers. The powers of the specialist tribunals (CCMA, Bargaining Councils and Labour Courts) are regulated by statutory provisions and deal with appropriate remedies (reinstatement and/or compensation) a wardable in appropriate circumstances. Certain specific areas nonetheless still remain problematic for these tribunals and hence questions that require clear direction from the drafters of our law are: How to distinguish misconduct in alcohol and drug abuse cases? What degree of intermittent absenteeism is required before dismissal would be warranted? In certain other areas the tribunals have been fairly consistent and prescriptive in their approach and remedies awarded. Included here would be permanent incapacity, HIV cases and misconduct. It will emerge, however, that under the 1995 LRA the position of employees and the protections afforded them have been greatly increased...|$|R

In recent years the discussion on occupational diseases increased, because this disease can lead to a <b>temporary</b> or permanent <b>incapacity</b> of the employee, bringing negative consequences not only for this, but also for the company or institution where the same work. From this premise, this study used two tools for data analysis of pain reported by workers and amplitudes of forced movements performed by these and, consequently, risk of musculoskeletal injury (SCI). The Diagram of Corlett and Manenica is a tool used to capture the feeling of tender points reported by respondents. As for the evaluation of jobs was used OCRA, Occupational Repetitive Actions, which is a tool for assessment and analysis of risk factors associated with repetitive movements of upper limbs, by calculating an index of quality. In the end we compared the exaggerated range of motion of the upper limbs data, held by workers with reports of pain in every joint of these members, checking whether or not the relationship between two variables. The use of OCRA filtered within the set of observed positions, only those {{with a high level of}} repeatability, and therefore are likely to generate LME. The results showed that the relationship between the presence of movements in exaggerated amplitudes and therefore the implementation of awkward postures of the upper limbs, is related to the onset of pain in this body region, and to this end, prevention and pro-activity in description of work tasks are of great importance for the reduction of these types of pain professionals...|$|R
