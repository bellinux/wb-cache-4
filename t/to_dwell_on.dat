5|$|Troubled by his {{constant}} anger, Chandru meets with {{a psychiatrist who}} advises him to marry soon so that he {{will no longer be}} lonely, saying the loneliness is leading him <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> his past and indulge in extreme acts. Chandru meets Rekha at a theatre and then at a book stall. He proposes to Rekha and even pleads with her to marry him. Surprised at his extreme pleading, Rekha politely informs him that she loves someone else (Ravi), and their marriage is already fixed. Raghunath is startled when Rekha tells him about Chandru's marriage proposal.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{nominated}} John Marshall Harlan, who {{had served}} in the Union Army. In joint debates across the state, McCreary stressed what many Kentuckians felt were abuses of power by Republican President Ulysses S. Grant during the Reconstruction Era. Harlan countered by faulting the state's Democratic politicians for continuing <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> war issues almost a decade after the war's end. He also attacked what he perceived as Democratic financial extravagance and the high number of pardons granted by sitting Democratic governor Preston Leslie. Harlan claimed these as evidence of widespread corruption in the Democratic Party. McCreary received solid support from the state's newspapers, nearly all of which had Democratic sympathies. Despite a late infusion of cash and stump speakers in favor of his opponent, McCreary won the general election by a vote of 130,026 to 94,236.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the work}} on the Redstone rocket, the 12 years from 1945 to 1957 were {{probably}} some of the most frustrating for von Braun and his colleagues. In the Soviet Union, Sergei Korolev and his team of scientists and engineers plowed ahead with several new rocket designs and the Sputnik program, while the American government was not very interested in von Braun's work or views and only embarked on a very modest rocket-building program. In the meantime, the press tended <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> von Braun's past {{as a member of the}} SS and the slave labor used to build his V-2 rockets.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} sources tell of {{the siege of}} the city from the {{perspective}} of the besiegers. No accounts of the events as seen from inside the city have survived to modern times. There is a total absence of Muslim sources, perhaps because of the absence of good writers in the city or perhaps due to a desire not <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> the loss of such an important city. Translations of some of the few Arabic texts that refer indirectly to the loss of the city are all that is available to cover this aspect of the history of the siege.|$|E
25|$|The {{narrative}} also wanders {{from the}} main action solely <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> elegant descriptions, with almost half the cantos having {{little to do with}} the proper story e.g. while describing the march of an army, cantos 9 to 11 take a detour to describe nature, sunrise and sunset, the seasons, courtesans preparing to receive men, the bathing of nymphs, and so on. Because of these descriptions, the Śiśupālavadha is an important source on the history of Indian ornaments and costumes, including its different terms for dress as paridhāna, aṃśuka, vasana, vastra and ambara; upper garments as uttarīya; female lower garments as nīvī, vasana, aṃśuka, kauśeya, adhivāsa and nitambaravastra; and kabandha, a waist-band.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, Travers {{wrote that}} the fire power of the modern Ottoman weapons and {{resilience}} of field fortifications, caused many Allied losses, particularly at V and W beaches. There was much criticism of Hamilton, for not ordering Hunter-Weston to send more troops to Y Beach {{but this was not}} due to Hamilton leaving discretion to his subordinate, since Hunter-Weston was ordered to divert part of the main force from V to W Beach at noon. Conditions at V Beach were not known to Hamilton, until he had been in contact with Hunter-Weston and interfering with the landing plan, could have added to the delays in landing troops. Hunter-Weston concentrated on the landings at V and W beaches and later on Hill 138, which was consistent with the tendency of generals on the Western Front <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> areas where enemy resistance was strongest and to reinforce failure. Travers {{wrote that the}} French landing at Kum Kale had been overlooked yet {{had been one of the}} most successful, despite initial Ottoman confidence that the landing would be defeated by the four battalions concentrated nearby. The Ottoman XV Corps commander General Weber Pasha was criticised for being unprepared, poor communications, tactics and leadership, when fighting in flatter terrain than that on the peninsula, on which the French artillery was able to dominate the Ottoman infantry. Despite this advantage, the French advance was stopped by the Ottomans on 26 April, in a costly defensive action.|$|E
500|$|Guitarist Kerry King {{has been}} outspoken {{in his defense}} of [...] "Jihad", and has claimed that the song has the [...] "coolest angle" [...] on Christ Illusion. [...] "These new songs aren't {{political}} at all," [...] King states, [...] "'Jihad', 'Eyes of the Insane' — it's what's spewing out at us from the TV." [...] He further clarified that the band was not attempting to promote the terrorists' perspective of the war, nor their ideological beliefs, although he expected others to assume that Slayer was doing so. They did not wish <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> the topic [...] "because every band on the planet already has" [...] and [...] "came from a certain perspective", so felt they had to present an alternative viewpoint. [...] "We're Slayer, {{we have to be}} different" [...] was King's assertion.|$|E
500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{gave the}} episode a more {{moderate}} review, writing that [...] "The Jam story was probably the only bright spot for me in an episode generally devoid of chuckles", {{and that it was}} [...] "not a terrible episode, but basic and a little boring." [...] He was complimentary towards the conclusion of the Jim-Pam plot, noting that the final scene was [...] "a warm moment", although he was surprised by the scene's placement in the season as a whole. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote positively of the finale scene, noting that [...] "it really worked", and that Krasinski and Fischer were [...] "terrific" [...] during the sequence. However, he said that the [...] "comedy parts of 'Paper Airplane' were so dire I'm not going <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> them at all".|$|E

500|$|Ruck {{says that}} with Cameron Frye, Hughes gave him [...] "the best part I {{ever had in}} a movie, and any success that I've had since 1985 is because he took a big chance on me. I'll be forever grateful." [...] "While we were making the movie, I just knew I {{had a really good}} part", Ruck says. [...] "My {{realization}} of John's impact on the teen-comedy genre crept in sometime later. Teen comedies tend <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> the ridiculous, as a rule. It's always the preoccupation with sex and the self-involvement, and we kind of hold the kids up for ridicule in a way. Hughes added this element of dignity. He was an advocate for teenagers as complete human beings, and he honored their hopes and their dreams. That's what you see in his movies." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Betsey Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times panned the [...] "overwhelmingly complicated, globe-hopping, enemies within, enemies without story line" [...] and 3D but noted that [...] "the humor, when it works, offers 'Retaliation' some redemption." [...] She ended with: [...] "It's convoluted. Frankly {{no one should}} {{have to think that}} hard {{to keep up with the}} Joes." [...] Another negative review came from Variety Magazines Justin Chang, who ridiculed the movie's large-scale destruction of foreign cities, writing: [...] "Audiences who thrilled to the sight of Paris under biochemical attack in Cobra will be pleased to watch London endure an even more horrific fate here, although the sequence is tossed off in quick, almost ho-hum fashion, with no time <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> anything so exquisitely crass as the spectacle of the Eiffel Tower collapsing." [...] He summarized the movie as [...] "a more straight-faced brand of idiocy than its cheerfully dumb 2009 predecessor." ...|$|E
500|$|Each {{episode of}} Twin Peaks was written sequentially; this allowed the overall plot to gather {{momentum}} as it progressed but allowed for the organic process of adding new elements as the writers thought of them; a process favored by series co-creator David Lynch. It also allowed Mark Frost, Lynch's partner in creating the series, to plan ahead to ensure plot details and threads would be revisited as necessary. Deschanel recalls the teleplay for the episode being approximately 40–45 pages long, which he felt offered the show a [...] "leisurely" [...] pace compared to modern television episode, which are filmed from teleplays of up to 120 pages. This allowed the series <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> its subtext and unexpressed desires of its characters, rather than focusing solely on narrative action. Deschanel and Peyton have described the episode as exemplifying the need to [...] "be a fan" [...] of the series to fully enjoy it, as the progression {{and development of the}} characters occurs over multiple episodes and rewards the attention of a regular viewer.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with London's Evening Standard in January 2013, Anthony Hopkins (who played the eponymous role in the 2012 Alfred Hitchcock biopic Hitchcock) questioned The Girls portrayal of the director {{and the need for}} a film about that period of Hitchcock's career: [...] "I talked to Tippi Hedren one day...and she never mentioned that...Whatever his obsession was, she didn't want <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> it...I don't think it's necessary to put all that into a movie." [...] Speaking to The Independent later that month, Hitchcock director Sacha Gervasi said, [...] " [...] seems a rare one-note portrayal {{of a man who was}} a little more complex than that. A lot of people, who were there, do not recognise this portrayal of him as this monster". Danny Huston, who played screenwriter Whitfield Cook in Hitchcock, told WENN.com that he believed Hitchcock would not have contested Hedren's account of him: [...] "Hitchcock was such a deliciously dark character that I don't think he would dismiss what Tippi was saying as not true." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{frequently}} criticised {{aspect of}} the game was its low and inconsistent frame rate. According to Trigger Happy author Steven Poole, [...] "The game's inadequate temporal resolution—owing to a wrongheaded choice to privilege visual detail over frame-rate—made it unplayable at higher difficulty levels." [...] In contrast, IGN {{pointed out that the}} frame rate [...] "can be sluggish in certain wide-open areas or when there are lots of enemies on-screen, but for some odd reason it's never really bothersome. Most of the time you're so caught up in the game that you don't notice it, and when you do, you're willing to forgive it as Perfect Dark is just too much fun <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> such an issue". Poole also described the [...] "lazy sci-fi fetishism" [...] of Joanna Dark's character design as [...] "a blatant and doomed attempt to steal the thunder of Lara Croft", and argued that she illustrated the challenges of characterising the protagonists of first-person shooters, a problem that GoldenEye 007 had avoided by using the already well-known character James Bond.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{household}} {{did not go}} into mourning (it was not prescribed for royal children younger than fourteen), his parents took the loss harshly. According to Lady Charlotte Finch, the Queen [...] "cried vastly" [...] and was [...] "very much hurt by her loss and the King also." [...] Later in August 1782 the Queen sent Finch a lock of Alfred's hair stating [...] "Receive This ... as an Acknowledgement for Your very affectionate attendance upon my dear little Angel Alfred, and wear the inclosed Hair, not only in remembrance of that dear Object, {{but also as a}} mark of esteem from Your Affectionate Queen". Alfred was buried at Westminster Abbey, though his remains were later moved to the Royal Vault in St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on 11 February 1820. His father continued <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> his death, and the sight of Alfred's posthumous portrait in a family painting by Thomas Gainsborough nearly a year after Alfred's death sent his three eldest sisters into tears. Six months after Alfred's death, his elder brother Octavius succumbed to the smallpox virus, further devastating the king. During one of his bouts of madness in 1812, George would have imaginary conversations with his two youngest sons.|$|E

2500|$|The {{personal}} {{mythology of}} Luceafărul is overall a poetic rendition {{of a personal}} philosophy of love.

This {{is not the case}} for other ideas he borrowed from Kunisch, which merely resulted in conventional pieces such as [...] "Miron and The Disembodied Beauty". The [...] "allegorical meaning" [...] is explained by Eminescu's own comment: [...] " [...] is immortal, but lacks good fortune." [...] The result, according to scholar Geo Vasile, is Eminescu's [...] "triumph in the world of ideas": [...] "Here, the Albatross-poet extends his wings in all their magnificent reach." ...|$|E
