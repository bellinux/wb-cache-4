50|$|Consequently, {{during the}} time the reverse thrust lever for the right engine was being moved forward (to reduce the reverse thrust), the {{airplane}} captain unintentionally moved the <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> for the left engine forward (increasing forward thrust). The reverse thrust of the right engine was reduced by the pilot gradually up to the stowed position and remained in that position until the time of colliding with the barriers. The <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> for the left engine was in the position corresponding to the forward thrust setting of roughly 60% of its full rated takeoff thrust, and remained in that position until the flight data recorder (FDR) stopped recording. The crew apparently did not notice the left engine’s increase in forward thrust.|$|E

This serves as a period for limber up, general observation and adjustments. Adjustments that are permissible include valve tappet clearance, breaker,point gap, spark plug gaps, clutch and others of a similar nature. No new parts or accessories can be installed without having mention made of it in the report. No data 2 ̆ 7 are recorded during this preliminary run except the time that the engine is operated. BELT HORSEPOWER TESTS TEST B: The throttle valve is hdd wide opened and the belt load on the dynamometer is adjusted so that the engine is at the rated speed recommended by the manufacturer. Carburetor, ignition timing and manifold adjustments are all set for maximum engine power. This test is designed to determine maximum belt horsepower of the tractor at ra. te. d speed and to measure fuel consumption at the maximum power on the belt. TEST C: For tractors with carburetors the best fuel economy does not always occur when the engine develops maximum power at rated speed. Test C is intended to allow the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s representative to select a more economical fuel setting even though there is a slight loss of power. This more practical carburetor setting is used in all later tests except test F. The throttle valve is held wide open and load adjusted to give rated rpm. Tests Band C are the same for diesel tractors, which have an altogether different fuel system. TEST D: The <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> is set so that the governor will maintain rated engine speed when rated load is applied. Rated load is 85...|$|E
40|$|Introduction One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems arising with operation of the conventional rototillers is severe vibration of the machine handle which is transmitted to the user’s hands, arms and shoulders. Long period exposure of the hand-transmitted vibration may cause various diseases such as white finger syndrome. Therefore in this study, vibrations of a new type of rototiller with ridged blades were investigated at the position of handle/hand interface in different working conditions. Finally, the maximum allowable exposure time to the rototiller users in continuous tillage operation was obtained according to ISO 5349 - 1. Materials and Methods Experiments were carried out in one of the farms with silty clay soil texture, located in Sari city, Mazandaran province, Iran. Vibration measurements were performed according to ISO 5349 - 1 and ISO 5349 - 2 standards in two different modes, including in situ mode and tillage mode. Vibrational parameters were obtained in three blade rotational speeds, i. e., low speed (140 - 170 rpm), medium speed (170 - 200), and high speed (200 - 230). Blade rotational speed varied by changing engine speed using the <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> <b>lever.</b> In each experiment, different vibrational values were individually recorded in three directions (x, y, and z). Experimental design and data analysis were performed in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications using the SPSS 16 software. Results and Discussion Based on the obtained results in this study, the RMS of acceleration increased by increasing in rotational speed for all of the conducted experiments. The reason is that number of cutting per unit of time and consequently the frequency of changing in the dynamic forces exerting on the blades dramatically increases with increasing the rotational speed of the blades. Noteworthy is that in most cases the variation of acceleration in the tillage mode showed similar trend with vibrational values in the idling mode. This represents a significant contribution of the combustion engine in vibration of the examined rototiller. Meanwhile, contribution of the engine in the total measured vibration was more than 50...|$|E

This serves as a period for limber up, general observation and adjustments.

40|$|Summary. The stabifity of an {{aircraft}} with automatic <b>throttle</b> and elevator <b>controls</b> {{has been investigated}} theoretically using an analogue computer. Throttle application proportional to change in airspeed,, incidence, or rate of pitch may provide damping of the long-period motion, but speed is shown {{to be the most}} suitable variable. The control of {{an aircraft}} having negative static margin is considered and shown to require either the addition of an integral <b>control</b> on the <b>throttle</b> or a combination of <b>throttle</b> and elevator <b>controls.</b> Where it is required to control height by means of the elevator, some aircraft flying under certain conditions can only be adequately stabilised by means of an automatic <b>throttle</b> <b>control.</b> 1.
