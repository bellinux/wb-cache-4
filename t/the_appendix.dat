5|$|Green {{ran into}} {{problems}} with Go Man Go's registration. At that time, the AQHA had {{two types of}} registration, <b>the</b> <b>Appendix</b> and the Tentative. Appendix-registered horses were the offspring of Thoroughbreds and either Tentative-registered Quarter Horses or Appendix-registered Quarter Horses. Go Man Go was originally registered in <b>the</b> <b>Appendix,</b> as his dam was an Appendix-registered mare. The way to advance out of <b>the</b> <b>Appendix</b> into the Tentative registry was to qualify on performance grounds and pass a conformation examination conducted by the AQHA. Go Man Go certainly qualified under the performance criteria, but his conformation was such that he resembled a Thoroughbred more than he resembled a Quarter Horse. Green knew {{that in order to}} increase his stud fees—the price paid for the right to breed a mare to a stallion—Go Man Go needed to acquire a regular registration number instead of his Appendix number. So Green appealed to the Executive Committee of the AQHA, which had the authority to award Tentative numbers to horses regardless of conformation exam results. In both 1956 and 1957, the committee declined to take action, waiting to evaluate the quality of Go Man Go's first foals before making a decision. Finally, in 1958, they awarded Go Man Go number 82,000 in the Tentative registry.|$|E

5|$|Green rosellas were {{regularly}} captured and kept as pets {{until the early}} 20th century. The species {{is reported to be}} hardier and easier to keep in captivity than other rosellas. However, it is not a popular bird in the aviary trade, possibly on account of its subdued colours. Like most species of parrots, the green rosella is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on <b>the</b> <b>Appendix</b> II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal. The species has a reputation for being apathetic and vulnerable to weight gain in captivity; hence it is recommended to be kept in a large aviary of at least 5m (15ft) long to keep it active, and to be fed little or no sunflower seeds. As it breeds late in the season, chicks are often small in the heat of summer and can suffer as a result.|$|E

5|$|Henry and his {{crusade to}} Finland {{were also a}} part of the legend of King Eric. <b>The</b> <b>appendix</b> of the early 13th century Västgötalagen, which has a short {{description}} of Eric's memorable deeds, also makes no reference to Henry or the crusade. Henry and the crusade are both fully present only in a version of Eric's legend that dates to 1344. Similarities in the factual content and phraseology regarding the common events indicate that either one of the legends has acted as the model for the other. Henry's legend is commonly considered to have been written during the 1280s or 1290s at the latest, for the consecration of the Cathedral of Turku in 1300, when his alleged remains were translated there from Nousiainen, a parish not far from Turku. Yet, even as late as in the 1470s, the crusade legend was ignored in the Chronica regni Gothorum, a chronicle of the history of Sweden, written by Ericus Olai, the Canon of the Uppsala cathedral.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{the green}} rosella was rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered species. This {{was on the}} basis of its large range—greater than 20,000km2 (7700mi2)—and small rate of decline in population. The King Island {{subspecies}} is listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 as vulnerable, and its population thought to number fewer than 500 birds. Around 70% of King Island's native vegetation has been cleared, and the remainder is highly fragmented and at risk of too-frequent bushfires. Like most species of parrots, the green rosella is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on <b>the</b> <b>Appendix</b> II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.|$|E
5|$|The ponies {{are most}} {{commonly}} bay, chestnut, or grey.

White markings {{on the head and}} lower legs are allowed, unless they appear behind the head, above the point of the hock in the hind leg, or above the metacarpal bone at the bend in the knee in the foreleg. Ponies failing to pass these standards may not be registered in the purebred section of the stud book, but are recorded in <b>the</b> <b>appendix,</b> known as the X-register. The offspring of these animals may not be registered as purebred New Forest ponies, as the stud book is closed and only the offspring of purebred-approved registered ponies may be registered as purebred.|$|E

5|$|This {{species was}} seldom seen in captivity before the late 1950s, after which time {{a large number}} of wild-caught birds entered the Australian market. Since then, it has become more common, but is still rarely seen outside Australia. Captive yellow-tailed black {{cockatoos}} require a large aviary to avoid apathy and poor health. There is some evidence that protein may be more important to them than to other cockatoos, and low protein has been linked with the production of yolkless eggs in captivity. Females in particular enjoy mealworms. They can be placid and tolerate sharing an enclosure with smaller parrots, but do not handle disturbance while breeding. As with other black cockatoos, yellow-tailed black cockatoos are rarely seen in European zoos, since Australia restricted exportation of wildlife in 1959, but birds seized by government agencies in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have been loaned to zoos that are members of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). In 2000, there were pairs of yellow-tailed black cockatoos in Puerto de la Cruz zoo in Spain and in Rotterdam. Like most species of parrots, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on <b>the</b> <b>Appendix</b> II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>appendix</b> is {{attached}} to the inferior surface of the cecum, and contains a small amount of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue which gives <b>the</b> <b>appendix</b> an undetermined role in immunity.

25|$|Although it {{has been}} long {{accepted}} that the immune tissue surrounding <b>the</b> <b>appendix</b> {{and elsewhere in the}} gut—called gut associated lymphoid tissue—carries out a number of important functions, explanations were lacking for the distinctive shape of <b>the</b> <b>appendix</b> and its apparent lack of specific importance and function as judged by an absence of side effects following its removal.

25|$|The cecum is {{the first}} section of the colon and {{involved}} in the digestion, while <b>the</b> <b>appendix</b> which develops embryologically from it, is a structure of the colon, not involved in digestion and considered {{to be part of the}} gut-associated lymphoid tissue. The function of <b>the</b> <b>appendix</b> is uncertain, but some sources believe that <b>the</b> <b>appendix</b> has a role in housing a sample of the colon's microflora, and is able to help to repopulate the colon with bacteria if the microflora has been damaged during the course of an immune reaction.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies in}} 2003 {{discovered}} that the immune system supports bio-film development in the large intestine. This was supported mainly {{with the fact that}} the two most abundantly produced molecules by the immune system also support bio-film production and are associated with the bio-films developed in the gut. This is especially important because <b>the</b> <b>appendix</b> holds a mass amount of these bacterial bio-films. This discovery helps to distinguish the possible function of <b>the</b> <b>appendix</b> and the idea that <b>the</b> <b>appendix</b> can help reinoculate the gut with good gut flora.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has studied}} whether the vermiform {{appendix}} has any importance in, C. difficile. <b>The</b> <b>appendix</b> {{is thought to}} have a function of housing good gut flora.

The B cells of <b>the</b> <b>appendix</b> migrate, mature, and increase the production of toxin A-specific IgA and IgG antibodies, leading to an increased probability of good gut flora surviving against the C. difficile bacteria.|$|E
