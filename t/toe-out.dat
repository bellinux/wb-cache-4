5000|$|A {{horse that}} is “tied {{in behind the}} elbow” has {{restricted}} movement of the upper arm because there is less clearance for the humerus (it angles into the body too much). Reduced clearance of legs causes horse to <b>toe-out</b> to compensate.|$|E

50|$|When a {{wheel is}} set up to have some camber angle, the {{interaction}} between the tire and road surface causes the wheel to tend to want to roll in a curve, as if it were part of a conical surface (camber thrust). This tendency to turn increases the rolling resistance as well as increasing tire wear. A small degree of toe (<b>toe-out</b> for negative camber, toe-in for positive camber) will cancel this turning tendency, reducing wear and rolling resistance. On some competition vehicles such as go-karts, especially where power is extremely limited and is highly regulated by the rules of the sport, these effects can become very significant in terms of competitiveness and performance.Toe-in and <b>toe-out</b> give the steering stability.|$|E

50|$|The {{potential}} advantages of hip resurfacing compared to THR include less bone removal (bone preservation), a reduced chance of hip dislocation {{due to a}} relatively larger femoral head size (given that the patient has an anatomically correct femoral head size), and easier revision surgery for any subsequent revision to a THR device because a surgeon will have more original bone stock available The potential disadvantages of hip resurfacing are femoral neck fractures (rate of 0-4%), aseptic loosening, and metal wear.Due to the retention of the patient's complete femoral neck other advantages exist: Surgeon induced discrepancies in leg length (as could happen with THR) are now minimized. Also, the toe-in or <b>toe-out</b> faults that could occur interoperatively with THR are now over because the femoral neck that determines foot direction is left undisturbed with hip resurfacing.|$|E

This solution provides for a castor wind-off measured to 1.02 degrees per g of braking deceleration. Compare the Honda NSX at 2.91 degrees per g, the Porsche 928 S at 3.60 degrees per g and the Jaguar XJ6 at 4.30 degrees per g respectively.

5000|$|Bump steer - {{the effect}} of {{irregularity}} of a road surface on the angle or motion of a car. It {{may be the result}} of the kinematic motion of the suspension rising or falling, causing toe-in or <b>toe-out</b> at the loaded wheel, ultimately affecting the yaw angle (heading) of the car. It may also be caused by defective or worn out suspension components. This will always happen under some conditions but depends on suspension, steering linkage, unsprung weight, angular inertia, differential type, frame rigidity, tires and tire pressures. If suspension travel is exhausted the wheel either bottoms or loses contact with the road. As with hard turning on flat roads, it is better if the wheel picks up by the spring reaching its neutral shape, rather than by suddenly contacting a limiting structure of the suspension.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the first}} steps of the {{lameness}} examination is to evaluate the horse at rest. A good evaluation of conformation, including overall body type, can help the practitioner determine the potential cause of lameness. Certain conformational defects can predispose a horse to injury, and knowledge of correct conformation can help narrow down possible causes of injury, especially when combined with the horse’s history. The horse's stance is also evaluated. Frequently resting a particular leg, [...] "pointing" [...] a foot (holding a leg {{out in front of}} the body), or standing in an abnormal position can indicate compensation for an injury. Shifting of weight is normal in the hind legs, but frequent shifting of weight in the front legs, or placing both front feet in front of the body, can indicate bilateral forelimb lameness. Stifle pain sometimes causes a horse to stand with the stifles rotated out. Hip and pelvic pain can produce a <b>toe-out,</b> stifle out, hock-in stance and that remains present at the walk.|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} if {{altering the}} foot progression angle (FPA) by varying magnitudes during gait alters the external knee adduction moment (KAM), knee flexion moment (KFM), knee extension moment (KEM) and/or symptoms {{in people with}} medial knee osteoarthritis (OA). Potential influence of pain and knee malalignment on load-modifying effects of FPA was investigated. DesignParticipants (n =  22) underwent 3 -dimensional gait analysis to measure KAM peaks, KAM impulse, KFM and KEM peaks. Following natural gait, five altered FPA conditions were performed in random order (10 ° toe-in, 0 ° FPA, 10 ° <b>toe-out,</b> 20 ° <b>toe-out</b> and 30 ° <b>toe-out).</b> A projection screen displayed their real-time FPA. Pain/discomfort at knees and feet/ankles were evaluated for each condition. Linear mixed models were used for statistical analysis. ResultsToe-in reduced the early stance peak KAM and KEM but increased the KAM impulse, late stance peak and KFM. <b>Toe-out</b> reduced the KAM impulse, late stance peak and KFM (P <  0. 001) but increased the early stance peak KAM and KEM. All effects were greater in participants with more varus knees. Pain significantly mediated the effect of altered FPA on the KAM impulse and late stance peak. In more painful individuals, toe-in was predicted to reduce the KAM impulse and late stance peak, and increase them for <b>toe-out</b> gait. There were no immediate symptomatic changes. ConclusionsEffects of altered FPA vary across all medial knee load parameters {{and it is difficult}} to determine an optimal direction of FPA change.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{examine the}} {{feasibility}} of a 10 -week gait modification program in people with medial tibiofemoral knee osteoarthritis (OA), and to assess changes in clinical and biomechanical outcomes. DesignFifteen people with medial knee OA completed 10 weeks of gait modification focusing on increasing <b>toe-out</b> angle during stance 10 ° compared to their self-selected angle measured at baseline. In addition to adherence and performance difficulty outcomes, knee joint symptoms (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale and total score, numerical rating scale (NRS) of pain), and knee joint loading during gait (late stance peak knee adduction moment (KAM)) were assessed. ResultsParticipants were able to perform the <b>toe-out</b> gait modification program with minimal to moderate difficulty, and exhibited significant increases in self-selected <b>toe-out</b> angle during walking (P <  0. 001). Joint discomfort was reported by five participants (33 %) in the hip or knee joints, though none lasted longer than 2 weeks. Participants reported statistically significant reductions in WOMAC pain (P =  0. 02), NRS pain (P <  0. 001), WOMAC total score (P =  0. 02), and late stance KAM (P =  0. 04).

Knee rotation significantly affects ACL strain. To understand knee rotation during dynamic knee valgus should help the clinician evaluate dynamic alignment. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine how the knee rotates during dynamic knee valgus and whether the knee rotation is affected by toe direction (foot rotation). Methods：Sixteen females performed dynamic knee valgus in three toe directions (neutral, <b>toe-out,</b> and toe-in) while maintaining the knee flexion angle at 30 °. The knee rotation angle was evaluated using a 7 -camera motion analysis system. Knee rotation was compared between the start position and the dynamic knee valgus position, as well as among the three toe directions, using repeated measures ANOVA models. Results：The knee significantly rotated externally in the dynamic knee valgus position compared with the start position in two toe directions (neutral and <b>toe-out).</b> A similar tendency was observed with the toe-in condition. Toe direction significantly affected the knee rotation angle. For <b>toe-out</b> and toe-in conditions, external and internal shifts of knee rotation compared with neutral were observed.

40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo {{determine}} the immediate {{effects of a}} <b>toe-out</b> foot progression angle modification during gait on the major lower limb muscle activation characteristics and to establish whether asymptomatic individuals and those with moderate knee OA have similar responses. DesignSeventeen patients with knee OA and 20 asymptomatic control subjects participated. Informed consent was obtained. Electromyographic (EMG) recordings were acquired from the lateral and medial gastrocnemii, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, rectus femoris and the lateral and medial hamstrings during neutral and <b>toe-out</b> walking conditions. The EMG waveforms were amplitude normalized to maximal voluntary isometric contractions and time normalized to the gait cycle. Principal component analysis extracted principal waveform features. Analysis of variance models tested for main effects and interactions. Bonferroni post hoc testing was employed (α= 0. 05). ResultsBoth groups altered foot progression angle by approximately 15 ° during <b>toe-out</b> walking (P< 0. 05). A shift in gastrocnemius activation towards later stance (P< 0. 05) and increased magnitude and duration of quadriceps activation (P< 0. 05) was found. A differential activation occurred in the overall magnitude and principal shape of the lateral and medial hamstring musculature in the asymptomatic group only (P< 0. 05). Significant group differences were shown in each muscle analysis (P< 0. 05). ConclusionNeuromuscular demands of adopting a <b>toe-out</b> gait differ from a neutral foot progression angle.

We hypothesized that 1) compared to landing at neutral foot position (0 ° rotation), landing in the toe-in position would increase lower extremity biomechanical risk factors associated with ACL injury, 2) landing in the <b>toe-out</b> position would mitigate these factors and 3) females would display greater changes in these factors when changing foot landing position compared to males.|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that selected gait kinematics, particularly lateral trunk lean, observed in patients with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis explain variation in dynamic knee joint load. MethodIn this cross-sectional observational study, 120 patients with radiographically confirmed varus gonarthrosis underwent three-dimensional gait analysis at their typical walking speed. We used sequential (hierarchical) linear regression to examine the amount of variance in dynamic knee joint load (external knee adduction moment) explained by static lower limb alignment (mechanical axis angle) and gait kinematics determined a priori based on their proposed effect on knee load (walking speed, <b>toe-out</b> angle, and lateral trunk lean angle). ResultsApproximately 50 % {{of the variation in}} the first peak external knee adduction moment was explained by mechanical axis angle (25 %), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score (1 %), gait speed (1 %), <b>toe-out</b> angle (12 %), and lateral trunk lean angle (13 %). There was no confounding or interaction with Kellgren and Lawrence grade of severity. ConclusionsGait kinematics, particularly lateral trunk lean, explain substantial variation in dynamic knee joint load in patients with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. While largely ignored in previous gait studies, the effect of lateral trunk lean should be considered in future research evaluating risk factors and interventions for progression of knee osteoarthritis...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} to use gait modifications in the retraining of patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA), {{in order to reduce}} the external knee adduction moment (KAdM). This study focused on the effect of walking speed, foot position and trunk sway, and on the 3 D knee moments. Gait analyses of fourteen healthy volunteers were performed in a gait laboratory. Subjects walked at three different speeds in their normal gait pattern, as well as with toe-in and <b>toe-out</b> gait and with medio-lateral trunk sway at a self-selected speed. Fast walking speed increased the KAdM (17 - 30 %) and flexion moment (32 %). A slower walking speed did not decrease the KAdM. Toe-in mainly decreased the KAdM (45 %) and the transverse moment (38 %) during early stance. <b>Toe-out</b> decreased the KAdM during late stance (56 %), but increased the KAdM during early stance and midstance (21 - 24 %), due to decreased endorotation of the hip with knee flexion. Trunk sway decreased the KAdM during early stance and midstance (31 - 33 %). Gait modifications mainly affected the KAdM, but changes in sagittal and transverse knee moments and kinematics were also observed. This indicates that, when estimating knee load, taking only the frontal plane kinetics into consideration may lead to erroneous simplifications.

30|$|Foot landing positions, also termed “toe-in” and “toe-out”, {{can affect}} lower {{extremity}} biomechanics.

40|$|In the {{research}} setting, instrumented treadmills {{are often used}} to study prolonged periods of walking. This thesis examines the effects of in-shoe foot orthoses on walking gait during prolonged periods of treadmill walking. The two types of foot orthoses investigated were: 1) a pedorthist hand-made orthotic with medial longitudinal arch (MLA) support and 2) a proprioceptive feedback-type orthotic designed to stimulate the intrinsic foot muscles of the MLA. The three kinematic variables observed over 60 minutes of intermittent treadmill walking were <b>toe-out</b> angle in the transverse plane, pelvic tilt angle in the sagittal plane, and trunk lean angle in the frontal plane. Kinematic data were collected with a real-time optical motion capture system that consisted of five high resolution digital cameras which tracked {{the location of the}} reflective markers placed on the surface of skin. Static and dynamic trials were collected and analyzed to calculate the change in joint angles every 5 minutes of testing. Due to the appearance of three distinct groups for the kinematic variables, each participant was assigned into one of the following groups: Increase Group, No Change Group, or Decrease Group based on the magnitude of the change in joint angles during the 60 minutes of treadmill walking. To be assigned into either the Increase or Decrease Groups, the kinematic variable had to change by at least 1. 5 ˚. In all three conditions, data interpreted within the three subgroups showed statistical significance. In the Control condition, statistical significance was detected in the Increase Group for pelvic tilt angle and the Decrease Group for <b>toe-out</b> angle. In the MLA orthotic condition, statistical significance was detected in the Increase Group for pelvic tilt angle and the Decrease Group for trunk lean angle. In the Proprioceptive orthotic condition, statistical significance was detected in the Increase Group for pelvic tilt angle and the Decrease Group for trunk lean angle. Overall, generic insoles and the two types of foot orthoses have minimal changes on the three kinematic gait variables over 60 minutes of treadmill walking...|$|E

Technique: The roll-over shape of a SACH, Flex, and single-axis foot was measured at four external rotation angle conditions (0 °, 5 °, 7 °, and 12 ° relative to neutral). Differences in foot compression between conditions were measured as average distance between roll-over shapes. Discussion: Increasing the transverse plane rotation angle did not affect foot compression. However, it did affect the effective lever arm, which was maximised with the 5 ° condition, although differences between conditions were small...|$|E
40|$|Excessive {{dynamic loading}} {{of the knee}} joint, {{quantified}} indirectly during three dimensional gait analysis, is {{a risk factor for}} the progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA). The overall objective of this thesis was to explore the effects of prolonged walking and the use of Nordic walking poles on selected gait characteristics indicative of knee joint load. The first study evaluated the time-varying behaviour, reliability, and validity of selected gait kinematics during 60 minutes of treadmill walking in 20 healthy adults. Maximum lateral trunk lean angle and maximum <b>toe-out</b> angle did not change over time, were consistent from day to day and were consistent with values assessed during over-ground gait analysis, suggesting that these measures are appropriate for use in studying potential adaptive gait mechanisms. The second study compared the time-varying behaviour of selected gait kinematics during 30 minutes of treadmill walking in 20 participants with, and 20 participants without, medial compartment knee OA, and explored correlations between these gait kinematics and pain intensity. Trunk lean, <b>toe-out,</b> and pelvic rise were different between those with and without knee OA, but did not systematically change over time in either group. Trunk lean and contralateral pelvic drop were significantly correlated to pain intensity. The third study was a technical report describing the use of three dimensional gait analysis and a Nordic walking pole instrumented with a compression load cell. This methodology was then used in the fourth study to evaluate the effect of walking poles used by 34 patients with medial compartment knee OA. Despite small reductions in the vertical ground reaction force, walking with poles increased the frontal plane lever arm, and therefore the knee adduction moment. The pole force in the vertical direction was inversely related to the increase in first peak knee adduction moment. Overall, this thesis suggests that, although biomechanically plausible, patients with knee OA do not naturally adopt gait characteristics or use walking poles in a way to decrease knee joint loads. These findings support the need for future efforts directed at explicitly teaching walking techniques, including the optimal use of assistive devices, to decrease knee joint loading...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the effects of controllable articulating winglets on glide performance and yawing moments of high performance sailplanes. Testing was conducted in the Texas A&M University 7 x 10 foot Low Speed Wind Tunnel using a full-scale model of the outboard 5. 6 feet of a 15 meter class high performance sailplane wing. Different wing tip configurations could be easily mounted to the wing model. A winglet was designed in which the cant and toe angles as well as a rudder on the winglet could be adjusted to a range of positions. Cant angles used in the investigation consisted of 5, 25, and 40 degrees measured from the vertical axis. <b>Toe-out</b> angles ranged from 0 to 22. 5 degrees. A rudder on the winglet was used to study the effects of changing the camber of the winglet airfoil on wing performance and wing yawing moments. Rudder deflections consisted of- 10, 0, and 10 degrees. Test results for a fixed geometry winglet and a standard wing tip are presented to show the general behavior of winglets on sailplane wings, and the effects of boundary-layer turbulators on the winglets are also presented. By tripping the laminar boundary-layer to turbulent before laminar separation occurs, the wing performance was increased at low Reynolds numbers. The effects on the lift and drag, yawing moment, pitching moment, and wing root bending moment of the model are presented. Oil flows were used on the wing model with the fixed geometry winglet and the standard wing tip to visualize flow directions and areas of boundary layer transition. A cant angle of 25 degrees and a <b>toe-out</b> angle of 2. 5 degrees provided an optimal increase in wing performance for the cant and toe angles tested. Maximum performance was obtained when the winglet rudder remained in the neutral position of zero degrees. By varying the cant, toe, and rudder angles from their optimized positions, wing performance decreases. Although the winglet rudder proved to be more effective in increasing the yawing moment compared to varying the cant and toe angles, the amount of increased yawing moment was insignificant when compared to that produced by the vertical tail. A rudder on the winglet was determined to be ineffective for providing additional yaw control...|$|E
