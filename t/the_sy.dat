500|$|While Worsley {{had been}} {{retrieving}} McNish {{and others from}} King Haakon Bay, Shackleton was advised of the fate of his Ross Sea party which had been tasked with laying depots on Shackleton's intended route across Antarctica. Ten men, forming a winter party, {{had set up a}} base at Hut Point, while their ship, <b>the</b> <b>SY</b> Aurora, owned by Shackleton, wintered at Cape Evans. In May 1915, the ship broke free from its moorings and became trapped in the ice. Badly damaged, it drifted with the ice for over six months before it broke free and its captain, Joseph Stenhouse, was able to sail it to New Zealand in March 1916. No one had heard from the stranded winter party at Hut Point for nearly two years. [...] After journeying {{with the rest of the}} survivors of his own party to Argentina, Shackleton, along with Worsley, left for New Zealand. From here they hoped to find a ship to take them south to retrieve the Ross Sea party.|$|E

Sometime thereafter the Enterprise, the guided missile cruiser USS Leyte Gulf and the guided missile destroyers USS Sterett and USS Bulkeley were sent to the area and arrived several days later on or about 21 February. Captain Dee Mewbourne, of the Enterprise, then proceeded with opening negotiations with the pirates, at which time two Somalis went aboard the Sterett. On the following morning, 22 February, while negotiations were still taking place, a pirate aboard <b>the</b> <b>SY</b> Quest fired a rocket propelled grenade at the Sterett from 600 yards away but it missed. Almost immediately afterward gunfire was heard aboard the yacht so a boarding party was sent in on a raft and they boarded <b>the</b> <b>SY</b> Quest.
