5|$|From {{his early}} student years, Dmowski {{was opposed to}} {{socialism}} and suspicious of federalism; he desired Polish independence and a strong Polish state, and saw socialism and conciliatory federalist policies as prioritizing an international idea over the national one.

5|$|Rodin {{restored}} {{an ancient}} role of sculpture– {{to capture the}} physical and intellectual force of the human subject– and he freed sculpture from the repetition of traditional patterns, providing the foundation for greater experimentation in the 20th century. His popularity is ascribed to his emotion-laden representations of ordinary men and women– to his ability to find the beauty and pathos in the human animal. His most popular works, such as The Kiss and The <b>Thinker,</b> are widely used outside the fine arts as symbols of human emotion and character. To honor Rodin's artistic legacy, the Google search engine homepage displayed a Google Doodle featuring The <b>Thinker</b> to celebrate his 172nd birthday on 12 November 2012.|$|E
50|$|With both {{thinking}} styles, each {{benefits from}} {{the existence of the}} other; internal <b>thinkers</b> 'feed' off of the rapid-fire ideas of external <b>thinkers</b> and, conversely, external <b>thinkers</b> are 'grounded' by the deliberate pace at which internal <b>thinkers</b> operate (Note that the speed at which each functions has no correlation to intelligence). Detailed and visionary <b>thinkers</b> succeed in opposite realms and collaboratively can produce results faster and better than alone.|$|R

5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd <b>thinker</b> about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|E

40|$|Systems <b>Thinkers</b> {{presents}} a biographical {{history of the}} field of systems thinking, by examining the life and work of thirty of its major <b>thinkers.</b> It discusses each <b>thinker's</b> key contributions, the way this contribution was expressed in practice and the relationship between their life and ideas. This discussion is supported by an extract from the <b>thinker's</b> own writing, to give a flavour of their work and to give readers a sense of which <b>thinkers</b> are most relevant to their own interests. Systems thinking is necessarily interdisciplinary, so that the <b>thinkers</b> selected come {{from a wide range of}} areas - biology, management, physiology, anthropology, chemistry, public policy, sociology and environmental studies among others. Some are core innovators in systems ideas; some have been primarily practitioners who also advanced and popularised systems ideas; others are well-known figures who drew heavily upon systems thinking although it was not their primary discipline. A significant aim of the book is to broaden and deepen the reader's interest in systems writers, providing an appetising "taster" for each of the 30 <b>thinkers,</b> so that the reader is encouraged to go on to study the published works of the <b>thinkers</b> themselves...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} analyze the three {{earliest}} Confucian <b>thinkers</b> and the foundational texts associated with them.

It has often been asserted that the tradition presented by these Confucian <b>thinkers</b> was entirely humanistic, altogether separate from the Ancient Chinese religiosityThis paper contests such claims,instead insisting that the early Confucian spirituality still viewed Tian as God and that the three earliest <b>thinkers</b> actually introduced new concepts which expanded, rather than diminished, upon the role of Tian...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{examines}} the cultural production of Palestinian <b>thinkers</b> and politicians regarding their cause. Through this examination, {{the main focus}} is to investigate what year 1948 or 1967, they regard as “beginning” for their cause. By the use of different theories such as nationalism as constructivism, the thesis examines how the Palestinian <b>thinkers</b> and politicians construct nationalist claims. By the help of Anderson’s “imagined political communities”, the thesis examines how Palestinian <b>thinkers</b> assist their nation to imagine fellow-members. Moreover, the <b>thinkers</b> and politicians’ narration of their nation is also investigated {{by the use of}} Bernard’s theorization of national narration. Here the <b>thinkers</b> and politicians’ texts {{can be seen as a}} will to narrate their nation. Furthermore, since Palestine is still colonized, a utilization of Chatterjee’s approach to anti-colonial nationalism is deployed in order show how through cultural production, Palestinians <b>thinkers</b> and politicians can be seen as showing cultural resistance to the colonial power. ...|$|R
