500|$|In January 2005, it was {{revealed}} Elliott {{had been working on}} a new album. Two months later, Ciara confirmed she would appear on the album, singing and rapping on the potential first untitled single at the time. Elliott worked on The Cookbook with such producers as the Neptunes, Rich Harrison and Scott Storch. The album included only two songs produced by Timbaland, who produced most or all songs on Elliott's previous albums. She explained, [...] "Me and Tim, this like our sixth album, so if we go any further left, we gonna be on Mars somewhere. We've done everything it is to do. I <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us came to a spot where we didn't know where to go with each other." [...] She said Timbaland was very involved with the album, supporting or opposing certain producers. Elliott went on to say, [...] "I was eight songs deep and I let Tim listen and he was like, 'Nah, you're going in the wrong direction. You trippin'.' I had to go back in the studio and come up with new records. , he was like, 'This is the Missy people are listening to.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{want him}} {{to give up his}} {{profession}} altogether," [...] said the squire, speaking firmly and slowly. [...] "It would be better, I <b>think,</b> for <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us that he should do so." ...|$|R
5000|$|Homosexuality and {{heterosexuality}} are {{conceptualized as}} two {{ends of the}} same spectrum. Sell argues to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> as two different dimensions.|$|R
6000|$|Maggie {{said this}} and left it, but {{the tone of}} it had the next moment {{determined}} in her friend a fresh reaction. [...] "You <b>think,</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> you, so abysmally and yet so quietly. But it's what will have saved you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll go {{wherever}} you go," [...] broke in Chet. [...] "And we'll do just {{whatever you want}} us to do. As Andy says, we are used to roughing it, and I <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us can stand as much as anybody. Why, I don't know that I've had a sick day in my life." ...|$|E
60|$|Notwithstanding {{the neglect}} of this matter at the Universities, do you think, at the present moment, you could not find ten non-professional persons, of the {{character}} you would think desirable, {{to add to the}} Academy?--If I may be so impertinent, I may say that you as one of the upper classes, and I as a layman in the lower classes, are tolerably fair examples of the kind of persons who take an interest in art, and I <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us would do a great deal of mischief if we {{had much to do with}} the Academy.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have seen}} {{a good deal of}} Mrs. Sartoris lately on her way to Rome (Adelaide Kemble)--eloquent in talk and song, a most {{brilliant}} woman, and noble. She must be saddened since then, poor thing, by her father's death. Tell me {{if it is true that}} Harriet Martineau has seceded again from her atheism? We heard so the other day. Dearest Mrs. Martin, do write to me; and do, <b>both</b> <b>of</b> you, remember me, and <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us kindly. With Robert's true regards, ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You, too, Bathurst!" [...] the Doctor exclaimed, as he wrung his hand; [...] "thank God for that, my dear boy; to <b>think</b> that <b>both</b> <b>of</b> {{you should}} have been saved--it seems a miracle. The picture on the smoke? Yes, we were {{speaking}} of it that last night at Deennugghur, and I never have thought of it since. Is there anyone else?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{stopped for}} a moment, and the color grew a trifle plainer in her face, {{though there was no}} {{wavering}} in her gaze. [...] "I want you to understand that I knew just what that man was--and still I led him on. It is a little hard to speak of; but one has to be honest, and when it is necessary I <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us can face an unpleasant thing. Well, I encouraged him because I couldn't see how I was to attain my object any other way. Still, you mustn't suppose it cost me nothing. It hurt all the time--hurt me horribly--and now I almost feel that I shall never shake off the contamination." ...|$|E
60|$|To {{punish them}} capitally {{would be to}} make massacres. Massacres only {{increase}} the ferocity of men, and teach them to regard {{their own lives and}} those of others as of little value; whereas the great policy of government is, to teach the people to <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> great importance in the eyes of God and the state, and never to be sacrificed or even hazarded to gratify their passions, or for anything but the duties prescribed by the rules of morality, and under the direction of public law and public authority. To punish them with lesser penalties would be to debilitate the commonwealth, and make the nation miserable, which it is the business of government to render happy and flourishing.|$|E
6000|$|... "You wouldn't {{expect a}} person {{to be proud of}} being a Mauritian, now [...] would you? But it is so. The most of them have never been out of [...] the island, and haven't read much or studied much, and they think [...] the world {{consists}} of three principal countries--Judaea, France, and [...] Mauritius; so they are very proud of belonging to one of the three [...] grand divisions of the globe. They think that Russia and Germany [...] are in England, and that England does not amount to much. They have [...] heard vaguely about the United States and the equator, but they [...] <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them are monarchies. They think Mount Peter Botte is [...] the highest mountain in the world, and if you show one of them a [...] picture of Milan Cathedral he will swell up with satisfaction and [...] say that the idea of that jungle of spires was stolen from the [...] forest of peg-tops and toothpicks that makes the roofs of Curepipe [...] look so fine and prickly.|$|E
5000|$|In September, KOCCA {{said the}} show [...] "runs a fierce debate on Korean culture" [...] and [...] "their speeches {{frequently}} become a hot issue among young viewers, sometimes {{for being too}} radical and sometimes too conservative. However, viewers can at least <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> sides <b>of</b> opinions." [...] KOCCA credits the show for not just including [...] "white people from advanced countries" [...] that Koreans are already familiar with, but also inviting guests from diverse countries with varied cultures.|$|R
6000|$|Eve. I {{grant him}} armed with subtilty and hate; But {{why should we}} suspect our happy state? Is our {{perfection}} of so frail a make, As every plot can undermine or shake? <b>Think</b> better <b>both</b> <b>of</b> heaven, thyself, and me: Who always fears, at ease can never be. Poor state of bliss, where so much care is shown, As not to dare to trust ourselves alone! ...|$|R

'Mother,' he said, 'there are two new {{animals in}} the woods to-day, {{and the one that}} you said couldn't swim, swims, and the one that you said couldn't curl up, curls; and they've gone shares in their prickles, I <b>think,</b> because <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them are scaly all over, instead of one being smooth and the other very prickly; and, besides that, they are rolling round and round in circles, and I don't feel comfy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Nay I rather <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> these shortcomings, fatal deficits both, are {{chargeable}} upon us; {{and it is}} {{the joint}} harvest of both that we are now reaping with such havoc to our affairs. I rather guess, the intellect of the Nineteenth Century, so full of miracle to Heavyside and others, is itself a mechanical or beaver intellect rather than a high or eminently human one. A dim and mean though authentic kind of intellect, this; venerable only in defect of better. This kind will avail but little in the higher enterprises of human intellect, especially in that highest enterprise of guiding men Heavenward, which, after all, is the one real [...] "governing" [...] of them on this God's-Earth:--an enterprise not to be achieved by beaver intellect, but by other higher and highest kinds. This is deficit first. And then secondly, Governments have, really to a fatal and extraordinary extent, neglected in late ages to supply themselves with what intellect was going; having, as was too natural in the dim time, taken up a notion that human intellect, or even beaver intellect, was not necessary to them at all, but that a little of the vulpine sort (if attainable), supported by routine, red-tape traditions, and tolerable parliamentary eloquence on occasion, would very well suffice. A most false and impious notion; leading to fatal lethargy on the part of Governments, while Nature and Fact were preparing strange phenomena in contradiction to it.|$|E

"I want to {{emphasize}} that I <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> these developmental paths are perfectly legitimate ways to become women, and regardless of how someone becomes a woman, if she identifies as such, we owe her the respect of recognizing her identity and addressing her appropriately." ...|$|E
5000|$|Other players, former players, officials, media {{commentators}} {{and fans}} also praised the behaviour of both players. Roger Federer {{said of the}} match, [...] "Its so impressive to see. I mean, I was watching this. I dont know if I was crying or laughing. It was too much". Federer also added, [...] "This is absolutely amazing. ... This is beyond anything". Novak Djokovic extolled both players, saying, [...] "You {{have to give them}} credit, both of them. Whoever wins today, I <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them are winners".|$|E
50|$|Marketing {{academics}} {{have shown}} that retailers should <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> the direct and indirect effect of substantial price promotions when evaluating their impact on profit. To make a very precise analysis one should also include effects over time. Deep price promotions may cause people to bulk-buy (stockpile), which may invalidate the long-term effect of the strategy. This is the association rule analysis.|$|R
6000|$|... "Señor, I did. We have voyaged {{together}} {{as far as}} Cyprus, on one occasion, and, again, to the island of the English.

5000|$|... "The Climb" [...] was not {{intentionally}} {{written for}} the 2009 musical film Hannah Montana: The Movie. Co-writer Jessi Alexander conceived the song's melody while driving {{to the home of}} songwriting partner Jon Mabe. Once she arrived, she and Mabe developed a song about overcoming life's obstacles inspired by their personal struggles in the music industry. Alexander referred to the process as a form of [...] "therapy" [...] and recalled, [...] "I was just driving to work one day. It's just a typical day, nothing really special about that day. And I just had this melody in my head. And I couldn't get to my co-writer Jon Mabe or my guitar fast enough because I just wanted to play what I was hearing. And, you know, we just kinda put it down pretty fast and didn't really think anything about it. The lyrics kinda started to come, I <b>think</b> for <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us, being kinda underdogs in the business. My co-writer was a songplugger, just turned songwriter, and I'd had record deals and ups and downs in the music business. I <b>think</b> for <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us, we just came from a place of, you know, 'it's not a race'." [...] The song they created was titled [...] "It's the Climb" [...] and was written in third person. Alexander described the original song as [...] "more spiritual" [...] than the version that was released, and said it contained lines about prayer. However, she claimed she knew it was pop and suitable for The Walt Disney Company.|$|R

He is loving and marries Bhadrayya's daughter Arundathi (Suhasini) without their permission for that reason his father sends him out. After some time Arundhati gets pregnant, Krishna Prasad is willing to send his wife to America for higher education. Gavaraju plans to kill Krishna Prasad and Arundathi in the attack Krishna Prasad dies saving Arundathi but people <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them die which splits the village into two and temple between the village is closed.|$|E
5000|$|Following her {{graduation}} from Harvard, {{she worked as}} a producer for the Charlie Rose show where she helped set up the segment [...] "Brain Series".

Her writing has appeared in many publications including The New York Times, The Atlantic, Slate, The Paris Review and The New Republic. In April 2013 she had an article published in The New Yorker for the first time, and continues to contribute regularly with articles about psychology and science.|$|E
5000|$|Responding to Tenet, Suskind {{challenged}} {{his credibility}} as a source on the issue, stating that [...] "George is the last man {{you want to call}} on something like this". Suskind stated, [...] "Tenet has talked often to reporters, even folks in Congress, that he doesnt remember anything, you know. Hes got a memory issue, obviously. And the people just shrug. Is it convenient? Is it something else? In any event, you know, I think Tenet is, you know, with the White House because I <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them are a bit in the same leaky rowboat on this one." [...] In an interview with Hannity & Colmes, Suskind admitted that he had not spoken to Tenet about the allegation.|$|E

The civilised people an' the Redskins ain't so {{different}} as some folk seem to <b>think.</b> They can <b>both</b> <b>of</b> 'em love an' hate pretty stiffly, an' they are both able to feel an' show gratitude {{as well as the}} reverse--also, they're pretty equal in the matter of revenge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity," [...] said Elizabeth warmly; [...] "but you must excuse my not being {{convinced}} by assurances only. Mr. Bingley's {{defense of his}} friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> gentlemen as I did before." ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} new results on {{consensus}} for continuous-time multiagent systems. We introduce {{the assumptions of}} persistent connectivity of the interaction graph and of slow divergence of reciprocal interaction weights. Persistent connectivity {{can be considered as}} the counterpart of the notion of ultimate connectivity used in discrete-time consensus protocols. Slow divergence of reciprocal interaction weights generalizes the assumption of cut-balanced interactions. We show that under these two assumptions, the continuous-time consensus protocol succeeds: the states of all the agents converge asymptotically to a common value. Moreover, our proof allows us to give an estimate of the rate of convergence towards the consensus. We also provide examples that make us <b>think</b> that <b>both</b> <b>of</b> our assumptions are tight...|$|R
5000|$|With {{the next}} {{collection}} of poems, Framtidens skugga ("The Shadow of the Future") (whose original title was [...] "Köttets mysterier" [...] ("Mysteries of the Flesh")), the visions that had exhorted Södergran culminate in poems speaking of a renewed world after the wars and catastrophes that now ravage the Earth - Raivola was, as stated earlier, {{a war zone}} in 1918, and even later Edith was able to hear gunfire from her kitchen window. The wording can lead one to <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> Walt Whitman and Jim Morrison when the poet takes {{on the role of}} fortune teller, general, or quite simply that of Eros' chosen intermediary, as in the poem Eros hemlighet ("Eros' secret").|$|E
5000|$|Buffy's second death did {{not result}} in another slayer being called because of Faith—a new slayer would not be called until her death; however, Buffy's second resurrection for some reason caused an {{imbalance}} in the Slayer line. Following her first death, Mayor Wilkins says that he does not want Buffy killed, because that will cause a new Slayer to be called, and, when she is discussing why she has been revived a second time with Giles, Buffy states, [...] "It was my time, Giles. Someone would've taken my place." [...] Following her second death, Buffy herself, addressing a group of Potential Slayers, says: [...] "My death could make you the next Slayer." [...] However, the shooting script for the final episode on the show originally included a much longer speech by Buffy to the potential Slayers, including the line [...] "It's true none of you has the power Faith and I have. I <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us would have to die for a new Slayer to be called, and we can't even be sure that girl is in this room. That's the rule.

2500|$|An {{aim of the}} Tractatus is {{to reveal}} the {{relationship}} between language and the world: what {{can be said about}} it, and what can only be shown. Wittgenstein argues that language has an underlying logical structure, a structure that provides the limits of what can be said meaningfully. The limits of language, for Wittgenstein, are the limits of philosophy. Much of philosophy involves attempts to say the unsayable: [...] "What we can say at all can be said clearly," [...] he argues. Anything beyond that—religion, ethics, aesthetics, the mystical—cannot be discussed. They are not in themselves nonsensical, but any statement about them must be. He wrote in the preface: [...] "The book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or rather—not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit to thinking we should {{have to be able to}} <b>think</b> <b>both</b> sides <b>of</b> this limit (we should therefore have to be able to think what cannot be thought)." ...|$|R
5000|$|About {{her work}} on the series, Rabe said, [...] "That twisted art sense of humor is right up my alley. I <b>think</b> <b>both</b> seasons <b>of</b> the show {{have had a lot}} of laughs - I know it might not be that way with everybody. I did have a lot of fun with that. Being so cruel to people, it's {{similarly}} painful to Nora the first season where I was suffering from so much heartbreak and loss and pain. It's a different kind of pain where you are literally the Devil. You just sort of lose your soul and detach. But that's also really fun so there's no complaining about going through that kind of pain because it's what gets me out of the bed in the morning, to play parts like that. I even got to sing and dance! I couldn't believe my luck! I felt very very lucky and in love with the part and I got to do so many different things." ...|$|R
