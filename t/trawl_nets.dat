25|$|A fishing trawler, {{also known}} as a dragger, is a {{commercial}} fishing vessel designed to operate fishing trawls. Trawling is a method of fishing that involves actively dragging or pulling a trawl through the water behind one or more trawlers. Trawls are fishing nets that are pulled along {{the bottom of the sea}} or in midwater at a specified depth. A trawler may also operate two or more <b>trawl</b> <b>nets</b> simultaneously (double-rig and multi-rig).|$|E

40|$|To obtain some {{fundamental}} suggestions on the gear-efficiency {{of the two}} different types of <b>trawl</b> <b>net,</b> the authors carried out the model experiment, and compared them with each other, basing on the physical characters of the net. The one is a six-seam net used on board of the 2 ̆ 7 Keiten Maru"" (854. 55 GT) for catching the demersal fishes: and here the otter board was rigged between the hand rope and the warp. The other one is shrimp <b>trawl</b> <b>net</b> used on board of the ""Satsunan"" (116. 57 GT) : and the otter board was directly rigged to the wing-tip in a traditional type. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows. (1) In ordinary towing condition, the height of the net mouth of the six-seam net and the shrimp <b>trawl</b> <b>net,</b> marked 3. 5 m and 1 m, respectively. In six-seam net the height of the net mouth (h) can be expressed in the following formula, h= (0. 15 - 0. 053 V) l. where l is maximum breadth of the net mouth without shrinkage in (m), and V is towing speed in (m/sec) when the distance between both wing-tips is about 30 m. In shrimp <b>trawl</b> <b>net,</b> the maximum height of the net mouth is limited by the otter board height. ""(2) The bag net and net shape of the six-seam net look like cigar-shaped and in shrimp <b>trawl</b> <b>net</b> it is conical shaped but short. These are concerned with the planning of the net design. (3) The net resistance of six-seam net is larger than that of shrimp <b>trawl</b> <b>net.</b> At ordinary towing condition the net resistance of six-seam net, marked in 3. 1 7. 0 ton. In shrimp <b>trawl</b> <b>net</b> it marked about 105 275 kg. This difference of the net resistance depends on the scale of each net. Considering from the net shape and other characteristics of net, the six-seam net with V-D type otter board seems to be suitable for catching the demersal fishes, and the shrimp <b>trawl</b> <b>net</b> with one directly rigged to the wing-tip seems to be suitable for shrimps. ...|$|R

25|$|While gillweed nets are a {{principal}} concern, {{other types of}} nets also pose a problem: <b>trawl</b> <b>nets,</b> purse seines, beach seines, longline gear, and driftnets. Driftnets are known for high rates of bycatch and they affect all cetaceans and other marine species. They are fatal for small toothed whales (Odontocetes) and sperm whales, {{as well as other}} marine mammals and fish such as sharks, sea birds and sea turtles. Many fisheries routinely use driftnets exceeding the EU size limit of 2.5km/boat. This illegal drift-netting is a major issue, especially in important feeding and breeding grounds for cetaceans.|$|E
25|$|Shrimp {{trawling}} {{can result}} in very high incidental catch rates of non-target species. In 1997, the FAO found discard rates up to 20 pounds for every pound of shrimp. The world average was 5.7 pounds for every pound of shrimp. <b>Trawl</b> <b>nets</b> in general, and shrimp trawls in particular, {{have been identified as}} sources of mortality for species of finfish and cetaceans. Bycatch is often discarded dead or dying by the time it is returned to the sea, and may alter the ecological balance in discarded regions. Worldwide, shrimp trawl fisheries generate about 2% of the world's catch of fish in weight, but result in more than one third of the global bycatch total.|$|E
500|$|Biscayne Bay is {{a shallow}} lagoon with little {{vertical}} density or salinity gradient {{due to its}} lack of depth. Instead of a vertical gradient, the bay shows a horizontal density gradient, with fresh water entering from the drainage canals {{on the west side}} and seawater entering through gaps in the keys and through the safety valve section of shoals. Bay salinity reaches a peak in June. Changes in the salinity pattern of the bay have had negative effects on formerly abundant species such as red drum. Biscayne Bay and Florida Bay are major nurseries for red grouper and gray snapper. The bottom of the lagoon hosts sponges and soft corals in places where grasses cannot not grow. Three primary species of seagrass are found in the park: turtlegrass, shoal grass and manatee grass. The endangered Johnson's seagrass is also found in small quantities in the bay, which is {{at the southern end of}} the grass's range. Roughly 75 percent of the central bay floor is covered by grasses. Scarring of seagrass beds by vessel groundings or propellers is a significant problem. About 200 such incidents are documented each year, with full re-growth requiring up to 15 years. The bay is also affected by commercial shrimp trawling, which is permitted in park waters. [...] The passage of roller-frame <b>trawl</b> <b>nets</b> does not harm grasses, but damages soft corals and sponges.|$|E

2500|$|Some wrecks, lost {{to natural}} {{obstacles}} to navigation, {{are at risk}} of being smashed by subsequent wrecks sunk by the same hazard, or are deliberately destroyed because they present a hazard to navigation. Even in deep water, commercial activities such as pipe-laying operations and deep sea trawling can place a wreck at risk. [...] Such a wreck is the Mardi Gras shipwreck sunk in the Gulf of Mexico in 4,000 feet (1220 meters) of water. The shipwreck lay forgotten {{at the bottom of the}} sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the Okeanos Gas Gathering Company (OGGC). Large pipelines can crush sites and render some of their remnants inaccessible as pipe is dropped from the ocean surface to the substrate thousands of feet below. <b>Trawl</b> <b>nets</b> snag and tear superstructures and separate artifacts from their context.|$|E
50|$|In particular, {{sea turtles}} can be caught when bottom {{trawling}} {{is used by}} the commercial shrimp fishing industry. In order to catch shrimp, a fine meshed <b>trawl</b> <b>net</b> is needed. This results in large amounts of other marine organisms being also caught as bycatch. When a turtle gets caught or entangled in a <b>trawl</b> <b>net,</b> it becomes trapped and is unable to return to the surface.

2500|$|Plastic waste {{has reached}} all the world's oceans. This plastic {{pollution}} harms an estimated 100,000 sea turtles and marine mammals and 1,000,000 sea creatures each year. Larger plastics (called [...] "macroplastics") such as plastic shopping bags can clog the digestive tracts of these larger animals when consumed by them {{and can cause}} starvation through restricting the movement of food, or by filling the stomach and tricking the animal into thinking it is full. Microplastics {{on the other hand}} harm smaller marine life. Pelagic plastic pieces in the center of our ocean’s gyres for example outnumber live marine plankton, and are passed up the food chain to reach all marine life. A 1994 study of the seabed using <b>trawl</b> <b>nets</b> in the North-Western Mediterranean around the coasts of Spain, France and Italy reported mean concentrations of debris of 1,935 items per square kilometre. Plastic debris accounted for 77%, of which 93% was plastic bags.|$|E
2500|$|Political {{opposition}} to the fishery began in 1885, {{based on the assumption}} that bycatch in the Chinese nets was killing large numbers of desirable young fish, especially salmon and striped bass. The opposition was exacerbated by the prevalent anti-Chinese sentiment in California in the late 19th century. Studies showed that the concerns were greatly exaggerated, and that the fishermen ate or gave away the edible fish. A 1932 report concluded that [...] "the average striped bass is too spry to be taken in any such rig." [...] Restrictive regulations were implemented, beginning in 1901 with an annual four-month closure of the fishery during the height of the season, a ban on the export of dried shrimp in 1905, followed by a ban on Chinese nets in 1911, forcing a switch to beam <b>trawl</b> <b>nets,</b> which required motorized boats. Arrests of Chinese fishing crews were common in the first decade of the 20th century. The ban on exports was lifted in 1919, leading to a tripling in production in the 1920s.|$|E
2500|$|Small and {{harmless}} to humans, the Arabian carpetshark {{is one of}} the few shark species {{suitable for}} private aquaria. It is collected for the aquarium trade, which is not believed to pose a substantial threat to its population. The meat and possibly the fins of this shark can be used, but because of its size most individuals landed are discarded. It is captured incidentally in intertidal hadra (artisanal stake-net traps), as well as in demersal trammel and <b>trawl</b> <b>nets.</b> The Arabian carpetshark forms the predominant component of the [...] "cat shark" [...] catch of Kuwaiti prawn trawls, which represents the second-largest bycatch (14% of total) of the fishery. It is also caught off Bahrain and likely elsewhere. Another potentially major threat to this species is habitat degradation: coral reefs in the Persian Gulf face bottom trawling, coastal development (especially large-scale land reclamation projects such as in the United Arab Emirates), Turkish dams on the Tigris-Euphrates river system, draining of marshes in Iraq, and oil spills. Coastal habitats off India are also similarly pressured. As both fishing and habitat degradation are likely to intensify in the region, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the Arabian carpetshark as Near Threatened.|$|E
