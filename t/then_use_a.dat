5|$|While {{progressing}} {{through the}} game, the player can {{take control of}} three different characters: Juno, Vela, and Lupus. Each character has a special ability {{that allows them to}} uncover areas which the other characters cannot reach. Juno can walk through magma safely, Vela can swim underwater indefinitely, and Lupus can hover {{for a short period of}} time. Therefore, choosing the right character for the right stage is critical in order to complete the game. Initially, the game forces the player to use the three characters individually until they reach a meeting point. Once they reach the meeting point, all of the worlds can be tackled with any character in any order. The overall objective of the game is to explore all the galaxy to collect several starship parts and save a large number of survivors. The player can <b>then</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> starship and travel to the final stage.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to assassinate President Dale, the Martians invade Earth, {{starting}} with Washington, D.C. As they attack the White House (and incinerate the White House tour guide), the Secret Service evacuates the President, but the First Lady Marsha is crushed to death by the Nancy Reagan chandelier. Taffy vanishes during the chaos. After the U.S. government unsuccessfully attempts a nuclear attack on the mother ship, the Martians expand their invasion {{to the rest of}} Earth, defacing world landmarks for their own amusement as they do so. That night, the Martians breach the bunker where Dale has been taken and the leader reduces Decker to the size of an insect before killing him. The Martians kill everyone else in the bunker except for Dale, who makes an impassioned speech in an attempt to plea for peace and his life. The Martians seem convinced, but <b>then</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> false hand to kill the President.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII-2, a 24-year-old Hope is {{leader of}} the {{scientific}} expedition group known as the Academy {{a decade after the}} events of Final Fantasy XIII. He helps Noel and Serah in their journey to find Lightning when they arrive in his time. Other than knowing that time travel is possible and wishing to undo events of the past, Hope is planning on reviving Cocoon with a different power source. Originally planning to create an artificial fal'Cie, he is dissuaded upon seeing a vision of Serah fighting his creation. He and his assistant Alyssa Zaidelle <b>then</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> time capsule to go 387 years into the future to oversee Hope's New Cocoon Project, a plan to build a man-made Cocoon in preparation for Cocoon's destined fall in the next century. When the old Cocoon does fall, Hope and Sazh manage to rescue Vanille and Fang from the crystal pillar before it crumbles.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1889, {{prerecorded}} wax cylinders were marketed. These have professionally made {{recordings of}} songs, instrumental music or humorous monologues in their grooves. At first, the only customers for them were proprietors of nickel-in-the-slot machines—the first juke boxes—installed in arcades and taverns, {{but within a}} few years private owners of phonographs were increasingly buying them for home use. Each cylinder can easily be placed on and removed from the mandrel of the machine used to play them. Unlike later, shorter-playing high-speed cylinders, early cylinder recordings were usually cut at a speed of about 120 rpm and can play for as long as 3 minutes. They were made of a relatively soft wax formulation and would wear out after they were played a few dozen times. The buyer could <b>then</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> mechanism which left their surfaces shaved smooth so new recordings could be made on them.|$|E
25|$|Shellcode {{cannot be}} {{executed}} directly. In order to analyze what a shellcode attempts {{to do it}} must be loaded into another process. One common analysis technique is to write a small C program which holds the shellcode as a byte buffer, and <b>then</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> function pointer or use inline assembler to transfer execution to it. Another technique is to use an online tool, such as shellcode_2_exe, to embed the shellcode into a pre-made executable husk which can then be analyzed in a standard debugger. Specialized shellcode analysis tools also exist, such as the iDefense sclog project which was originally released in 2005 {{as part of the}} Malcode Analyst Pack. Sclog is designed to load external shellcode files and execute them within an API logging framework. Emulation based shellcode analysis tools also exist such as the sctest application {{which is part of the}} cross platform libemu package. Another emulation based shellcode analysis tool, built around the libemu library, is scdbg which includes a basic debug shell and integrated reporting features.|$|E

500|$|Grand Port was {{an easily}} defendable natural harbour because the bay was {{protected}} from the open sea by a large coral reef through which a complicated channel meandered, known only to experienced local pilots. Île de la Passe was vitally important in the control of Grand Port because it featured a heavy battery that covered {{the entrance to the}} channel, thus controlling the passage to the sheltered inner lagoon. The British planned to use the troops on Nereide, under her captain Nesbit Willoughby, to storm Île de la Passe and capture the battery. Willoughby would <b>then</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> local man serving on his ship named John Johnson (known in some texts as [...] "the black pilot"), to steer through the channel and land troops near the town, distributing leaflets promising freedom and prosperity under British rule in an attempt to corrode the morale of the defenders.|$|E
500|$|By April, Robert W. Woolley {{had been}} {{commissioned}} as Director of the Mint, and he approved {{samples of the}} gold dollar, the first to have work completed, on April 22. [...] He then traveled to San Francisco, and was there when the dies for the dollar arrived on the 27th. [...] When the San Francisco Mint's coiner examined them, they proved to be lacking the mint mark [...] "S", customary on coins produced there. [...] Woolley was not sure if this was intentional, and wired to Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. Joyce on the 29th. [...] Upon learning that it was intentional—Joyce reasoned that as the entire mintage of this, the first commemorative issue to be struck outside Philadelphia, would be produced at San Francisco, {{there was no need}} to use a mint mark—Woolley ordered that the dies at San Francisco and in transit be returned to Philadelphia, and new ones produced with the mint mark. [...] Woolley believed that people would assume the coins were struck at Philadelphia, which did not <b>then</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> mint mark. Burdette notes that the San Francisco Mint was a source of local pride and the omission of the mint mark would likely have led to widespread protest, and possibly to two varieties of each of the new coins: with mint mark, and without. New dollar dies were sent from Philadelphia on May 3, and for the half dollar the following day. [...] Dies for the $50 followed on May 14, and for the quarter eagle on May 27.|$|E

2500|$|Some older designs, {{like the}} AMP and Mountain Cycles brakes, use a cable from lever to caliper, <b>then</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> master {{cylinder}} {{integrated into the}} piston. Some Santana tandem bicycles used a cable from lever to a master cylinder mounted near the head tube, with a hydraulic line to the rear wheel caliper.

2500|$|The game also {{includes}} a [...] "Hunter Ranking" [...] system whereby the player is awarded [...] "Hunter Points" [...] for killing a specific number of particular enemies. As the player's rank increases, prizes are awarded. Tied into the hunter system are [...] "Quarries" [...] - mini-bosses which award {{a great deal of}} hunter points.

2500|$|For flow {{of liquid}} with a free surface, the {{hydraulic}} radius must be determined. This is the cross-sectional area of the channel divided by the wetted perimeter.

Some texts <b>then</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> characteristic dimension that is four times the hydraulic radius, chosen because it gives the same value of Re for the onset of turbulence as in pipe flow, while others use the hydraulic radius as the characteristic length-scale with consequently different values of [...] for transition and turbulent flow.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} methods for forming {{internal}} cavities in extrusions. One {{way is to}} use a hollow billet and <b>then</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> fixed or floating mandrel. A fixed mandrel, also known as a German type, means it is integrated into the dummy block and stem. A floating mandrel, also known as a French type, floats in slots in the dummy block and aligns itself in the die when extruding. If a solid billet is used as the feed material then it must first be pierced by the mandrel before extruding through the die. A special press is used in order to control the mandrel independently from the ram. The solid billet could also be used with a spider die, porthole die or bridge die. All of these types of dies incorporate the mandrel in the die and have [...] "legs" [...] that hold the mandrel in place. During extrusion the metal divides, flows around the legs, then merges, leaving weld lines in the final product.|$|E
