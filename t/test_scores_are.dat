2500|$|An example {{this method}} is in the {{prediction}} of college grade point average (GPA) where high school GPA and admissions test scores (e.g., SAT, ACT) usually account for {{a large proportion of}} variance in college GPA. The use of admissions tests is supported by incremental validity evidence. For example, the pre-2000 SAT correlated [...]34 with freshman GPA while high school GPA correlated [...]36 with freshman GPA. It might seem that both measures are strong predictors of freshman GPA, but in fact high school GPA and SAT scores are also strongly correlated, so we need to test for how much predictive power we get from the SAT when we account for high school GPA. The incremental validity is indicated by the change in R-square when high school GPA included in the model. In this case, high school GPA accounts for 13% of the variance in freshman GPA and the combination of high school GPA plus SAT accounts for 20% of the variance in freshman GPA. Therefore, the SAT adds 7 percentage points to our predictive power. If this is significant and deemed an important improvement, then we can say that the SAT has incremental validity over using high school GPA alone to predict freshman GPA. Any new admissions criterion or test must add additional predictive power (incremental validity) in order to be useful in predicting college GPA when high school GPA and <b>test</b> <b>scores</b> <b>are</b> already known.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{approach}} of validating school placement decisions is presented and ap­plied to {{a representative sample}} of N = 2 300 Luxembourgish 9 th graders. In this approach, the vali­dation criterion “keeping the track” was supplemented by a criterion based on scores of standardized scholastic aptitude tests. For this purpose, students’ <b>test</b> <b>scores</b> <b>were</b> allocated to either of two catego­ries. These categories were separated by the <b>test</b> <b>score</b> that represented the intersection of the distribu­tions of <b>test</b> <b>scores</b> of students from either the vocational track or the academic track of Luxembour­gish secondary school. Students of the vocational track were considered as being misclassified if their <b>test</b> <b>score</b> <b>was</b> above the intersection <b>test</b> <b>score,</b> students of the academic track were considered as being misclassified if their <b>test</b> <b>score</b> <b>was</b> below the intersection <b>test</b> <b>score.</b> According to this classifi­cation rule, about 21 % of all students were misclassified. Predictive validity was estimated by the degree of agreement between school placement decisions and test categories and between school placement decisions and actual tracks, with the latter being higher than the former. The results ob­tained were discussed as indicators of both a lack of permeability of the Luxembourgish school sys­tem and placement decisions being only partially based on students’ performance...|$|R
