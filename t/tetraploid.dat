5|$|From 1983 to 1985, Cathy A. Paris, then a {{graduate}} student, gathered specimens of A.pedatum from non-serpentine soils in the Midwest and Vermont, and from serpentine soils in New England and Canada, for biosystematic analysis. In 1988, Paris and Michael D. Windham published {{the results of}} this analysis, revealing A.pedatum in North America to be a cryptic species complex. They showed that A.pedatum sensu lato included two well-distinguished diploid taxa, one found in the Eastern woodlands, and the other found both in the Western mountains and as a disjunct on serpentine in the East. However, not all of the serpentine disjuncts proved to belong to the Western taxon. Several of them, including most of the specimens in Vermont, were found to be <b>tetraploid,</b> forming a taxon distinguishable from the two diploids. Isozyme banding patterns suggested that the <b>tetraploid</b> had arisen by hybridization between the eastern subspecies of non-serpentine woodlands and the western and serpentine taxon, followed by a duplication of the hybrid genome through polyploidy (allowing the chromosomes to pair and restoring sexual fertility). This allotetraploid was also morphologically intermediate between the two taxa, although it more closely resembled the serpentine taxon (hence its referral to var.aleuticum before Paris's work). Paris formally described the <b>tetraploid</b> as a new species, A.viridimontanum, in 1991, and also separated the western and serpentine taxon from A.pedatum as the species A.aleuticum. The type specimen of A.viridimontanum was collected from a talus slope at the old asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain on August 28, 1985. The sequencing of several chloroplast DNA loci has revealed that the A.viridimontanum chloroplast genome most closely resembles that of A.aleuticum, suggesting that A.aleuticum was the maternal parent of A.viridimontanum.|$|E

Many crop species are hybrids, including notably the polyploid wheats: some have {{four sets of}} chromosomes (<b>tetraploid)</b> or six (hexaploid), while other wheat species have (like most eukaryotic organisms) two sets (diploid), so hybridization events likely involved the doubling of chromosome sets, causing immediate genetic isolation.|$|E

In Comana lake, tetra- and octoploids were found, whereas in the Danube Delta also hexaploids occurred. In freshwater habitats, shoots of octoploids were longer and thicker with more nodes than those of <b>tetraploids.</b> Panicles of octopoids were also larger than those of <b>tetraploids.</b> The number of alive leaves did not differ between ploidy levels. Total leaf area, however was higher of octo- than of <b>tetraploids,</b> which indicates that octoploids produced larger leaves. Octoploids also had thicker rhizomes. No differences in allocation of dry matter to leaves, stems, and leaves (blades and sheaths) were found between tetra- and octoploids.

5|$|Asplenium bradleyi, {{commonly}} known as Bradley's spleenwort or cliff spleenwort, is a rare epipetric fern of east-central North America. Named after Professor Frank Howe Bradley, who first collected it in Tennessee, it may be found infrequently {{throughout much of the}} Appalachian Mountains, the Ozarks, and the Ouachita Mountains, growing in small crevices on exposed sandstone cliffs. The species originated as a hybrid between mountain spleenwort (Asplenium montanum) and ebony spleenwort (Asplenium platyneuron); A.bradleyi originated when that sterile diploid hybrid underwent chromosome doubling to become a fertile <b>tetraploid,</b> a phenomenon known as allopolyploidy. Studies indicate that the present population of Bradley's spleenwort arose from several independent doublings of sterile diploid hybrids. A.bradleyi can also form sterile hybrids with several other spleenworts.|$|E

The diploid plants of O. punctata are early-maturing annuals with a small biomass, while the <b>tetraploids</b> are large, vigorous perennials. From the anatomical and morphological traits: the diploids have narrower leaves (0. 95 - 1. 36 cm wide) than the <b>tetraploids</b> (1. 9 - 2. 3 cm); the culms of diploids are generally thin (0. 28 - 0. 35 cm in diameter) compared to the <b>tetraploids</b> (0. 37 - 0. 57 cm); the diploids have longer spikelets (6. 20 - 7. 04 mm) with length/breadth> 3; longer awns (52 - 86 mm) than the <b>tetraploids</b> (20 - 31 mm).

5|$|B. pendula is {{distinguished}} from the related downy birch (B. pubescens, the other common European birch) in having hairless, warty shoots (hairy and without warts in downy birch), more triangular leaves with double serration on the margins (more ovoid and with single serrations in downy birch), and whiter bark often with scattered black fissures (greyer, less fissured, in downy birch). It is also distinguished cytologically, silver birch being diploid (with two sets of chromosomes), whereas downy birch is <b>tetraploid</b> (four sets of chromosomes). Hybrids between the two are known, but are very rare, and being triploid, are sterile. The two have differences in habitat requirements, with silver birch found mainly on dry, sandy soils, and downy birch more common on wet, poorly drained sites such as clay soils and peat bogs. Silver birch also demands slightly more summer warmth than does downy birch, which is significant in the cooler parts of Europe. Many North American texts treat the two species as conspecific (and cause confusion by combining the downy birch's alternative vernacular name 'white birch', with the scientific name B. pendula of the other species), but they are regarded as distinct species throughout Europe.|$|E
5|$|Most sexually {{reproducing}} {{organisms are}} diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in cytokinesis. This can occur early in development {{to produce an}} autopolyploid or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid (endopolyploidy), or during gamete formation. An allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but {{may be unable to}} cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new species. Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce vegetatively or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals.

40|$|The {{conditions}} for the coexistence of diploids, triploids and <b>tetraploids</b> in a single population were investigated with a deterministic model under the assumptions that diploids might produce 2 n gametes, and that triploids had a lower fitness than other cytotypes and generated equal proportions of haploid and diploid gametes. When diploids produced only haploid gametes, {{the dynamics of the}} cytotypes were similar to that of heterozygote disadvantage with two alleles at a single locus, with triploids being equivalent to the heterozygotes. Production of 2 n gametes by diploids increased the pool of diploid gametes and created a stable equilibrium involving a majority of diploids and a minority of polyploids. When the fitness of <b>tetraploids</b> was equal to or higher than that of diploids, increased triploid fitness decreased the threshold of 2 n gametes necessary to deterministically fix <b>tetraploids</b> in the population. Conversely, when <b>tetraploids</b> were less fit than diploids, the rate of 2 n gamete production leading to the exclusion of diploids first decreases and then increased with increasing triploid fitness. Triploids are repeatedly found in diploid-tetraploid hybridizations and are rarely totally sterile. They might play a determinant role in the future of multiple cytotype populations.
