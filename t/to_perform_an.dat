5|$|In 1845, Arago {{suggested}} to Fizeau and Foucault that {{they attempt to}} measure the speed of light. Sometime in 1849, however, {{it appears that the}} two had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a rotating mirror, but a toothed wheel apparatus <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>an</b> absolute measurement of the speed of light in air. In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures of the speed of light in air versus water. Foucault used a scaled-up version of the rotating mirror apparatus <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>an</b> absolute measurement of the speed of light in 1862. Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred Cornu in 1872–76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877–1931 used improved versions of the toothed wheel and rotating mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates of the speed of light.|$|E

5|$|At 6:49 pm fire crews {{waiting to}} connect to Phoenix {{reported}} she was having difficulty getting close enough because of low tide conditions. Despite the problems requiring pilot and commander Arvid Havneras <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>an</b> extraordinarily hazardous docking procedure, at 7:00 pm Phoenix was ready to pump at the Marina lagoon, two blocks away from the first fire. By this time the whole neighborhood was threatened with destruction by fire. Fire crews were manning hoses laid in anticipation; firefighters at the burning buildings were instructed to hold their ground, that they would soon have more water.|$|E

5|$|Blacknose {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger sharks, and captives have been {{observed}} <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>an</b> apparent threat display towards encroaching divers or newly introduced members of their species. The display consists of the shark hunching its back, lowering its pectoral fins, gaping its jaws, and swimming with an exaggerated side-to-side motion. Known parasites of this species include the copepods Nesippus orientalis, Perissopus dentatus, Pandarus sinuatus, Kroyeria sphyrnae, Nemesis atlantica, and Eudactylina spinifera, as well as tapeworms in the genera Paraorygmatobothrium and Platybothrium.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{are called}} in to investigate, as the victim's {{description}} seems {{similar to those of}} other victims of a lonely hearts killer still at large. Scully attempts <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>an</b> autopsy on Lauren's body, only to find that it has liquified with only a skeleton remaining. Scully later discerns that the substance coating the body was a concentrated digestive enzyme, and that the remains are lacking in body fat.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, Franck {{teamed up}} with Hertz <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>an</b> {{experiment}} to investigate fluorescence. They designed a vacuum tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapour of mercury atoms. They discovered that when an electron collided with a mercury atom it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9electron volts) of its kinetic energy before flying away. A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely {{the same amount of}} its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy.|$|E

At the museum, Mona hears noises from a restroom and, upon opening a toilet lid, she sees rats forcing {{their way out of the}} sewer. When the two agents arrive, they discover Bilac crying beside one of the toilets, saying that Mona is dead.|$|E
5|$|O'Donoghue complained {{directly}} to Belushi {{that he thought}} his parody of Shatner during the dress rehearsals was inadequate and needed much improvement. Further, actor Chevy Chase was annoyed that he was satirizing Leonard Nimoy as Spock; {{he did not like}} the idea of playing second-fiddle to Belushi. During all of the rehearsals, Chase attempted to attract more attention to his character's role and dominate the scene. Just prior to the actual on-air performance of the sketch, O'Donoghue admonished Belushi and implored him <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>an</b> effective parody. Belushi's dress rehearsal performance had worried executives so much that they had discussed canceling the entire sketch altogether.|$|E

5|$|On 8 May 1975, while {{practicing}} a 9-g aerial display maneuver {{with the}} second YF-16 (tail number 72-1568) at Fort Worth, Texas, prior to {{being sent to the}} Paris Air Show, one of the main landing gear jammed. The test pilot, Neil Anderson, had <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>an</b> emergency gear-up landing and chose {{to do so in the}} grass, hoping to minimize damage and to avoid injuring any observers. The aircraft was only slightly damaged, but due to the mishap the first prototype was sent to the Paris Air Show in its place.|$|E
5|$|The {{defining}} {{mission of}} the Marine Corps has been <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>an</b> amphibious landing, and they were {{particularly interested in the}} JVX program. They realized that a concentrated strike force was vulnerable to a single nuclear weapon, airborne solutions with good speed and range allowed for significant dispersal; and their CH-46s were wearing out; without replacement, the threat of a merger between the Marine Corps and the Army lingered, similar to President Truman's proposal following World War II. The OSD and Navy administration were against the tiltrotor project, but congressional pressure eventually proved persuasive.|$|E
5|$|The mission's planet finding {{component}} {{was set up}} {{to serve}} as an important complement to the future missions designed to image and measure terrestrial and other exoplanets. SIM Lite was <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>an</b> important task that these missions will not be capable of: determining planet masses. Another task that the SIM was envisioned to perform for the future missions will include providing the orbital characteristics of the planets. With this knowledge other missions can estimate the optimal times and projected star–planet separation angles for them to observe the terrestrial (and other) planets SIM has detected.|$|E

5|$|The {{network of}} lines south of Preston allowed great {{flexibility}} in the routing of trains. A train approaching the town {{on any of the}} lines from the south (except the WLR from Southport) could be routed to enter the station via either the North Union or the East Lancashire line. It was even possible for trains from the north <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>an</b> effective U-turn, a feat sometimes carried out by trains between Scotland and Blackpool that would otherwise have had to reverse.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the prior}} {{introduction}} of the Princess Royal class had provided the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) with more powerful locomotives to be used on the main line between London Euston and Glasgow Central, {{the board of directors}} were persuaded in 1936 that more such locomotives would be needed, particularly as they were being asked to approve the introduction of a new non-stop service between those cities, designated the Coronation Scot. Initially, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, William Stanier, planned to build five more Princess Royals, but the Chief Technical Assistant and Chief Draughtsman at the LMS Derby Works, Tom Coleman, argued that it would be preferable to design a new class of locomotive that was more powerful, more reliable and easier to maintain. Stanier was convinced and the drawing office commenced designing the new class. When Stanier was called on <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>an</b> assignment in India, Coleman became responsible for most of the detailed design in his absence.|$|E
5|$|Battles are {{triggered}} {{when the}} player encounters an enemy in the overworld. Battles {{take place in}} a themed arena, using a version of the Active Time Battle system: each side is given a turn in which <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>an</b> action such as attacking. Each side can also interrupt an opponent's action, prolonging their waiting time. At the end of battle, players are granted experience points, which raise their experience level and boost their maximum health and statistics, in addition to in-game currency. Players can form a three-strong party to fight monsters, explore and battle alone, or loan non-active player characters of a similar or lower experience level for a fee, which are then controlled in battle by the game's artificial intelligence. Any character can be loaned to three different people, and the loaned character keeps the experience points and gold that they have earned.|$|E

For classified reasons, Quinn has ordered Remmick <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>an</b> investigation of the Enterprise and its crew and expects Picard to fully co-operate. Remmick's query causes tension in the crew, particularly when he questions the trustworthiness of the senior staff based on their personal logs and past actions. A young cadet, having failed the Starfleet Academy entrance examination, attempts to run away in a shuttlecraft but ends up drifting. Picard is able to direct the cadet to pilot the shuttle away from a planet by bouncing off the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Civil and {{criminal}} cases commenced after its completion, as was intended. In an uncommon case, heard at the Castellania in 1774, was when an intersex person, 17-year-old Rosa Mifsud from Luqa, petitioned for a sex change by wearing as a man, {{instead of the}} female clothing worn ever since born. Two medical experts were appointed by the court <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>an</b> examination. This case gives detail {{of the use of}} experts in the field, similar to the late modern period. The examiners were the Physician-in-Chief (during the British period was replaced by the Chief Government Medical Officer) and a senior surgeon, both working at the Sacra Infermeria. The Grandmaster took the decision for Mifsud to wear only men clothes from then on. The decision was taken to the court of appeals, which appointed other seven medical experts that agreed with the observations of the previous two experts.|$|E
5|$|From {{the advent}} of very-large-scale {{integration}} (VLSI) computer-chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986, speed-up in computer architecture was driven by doubling computer word size—the amount of information the processor can manipulate per cycle. Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>an</b> operation on variables whose sizes are greater than {{the length of the}} word. For example, where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers, the processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer using the standard addition instruction, then add the 8 higher-order bits using an add-with-carry instruction and the carry bit from the lower order addition; thus, an 8-bit processor requires two instructions to complete a single operation, where a 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with a single instruction.|$|E
