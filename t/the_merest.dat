25|$|Claudius, showed himself {{grateful}} to Agrippa for important services rendered him, and upon his accession, placed under his rule {{the remainder of}} Palestine, the territories of Samaria, Judea, and Idumæa, formerly governed by Archelaus. Loaded with honors and titles, Agrippa returned home, and the few remaining years of his benevolent sway afforded the people {{a brief period of}} peace and prosperity. The evil consequences of a ruler's unbridled passions and tyranny had been sufficiently evident to him in Rome, and they had taught him moderation and strict self-control. His people regarded him with love and devotion, because he healed with tender hand the deep wounds inflicted upon the national susceptibilities by brutal Roman governors. He ruled his subjects with compassion and friendliness. Like the ancestral Asmoneans from whom he sprang through his noble grandmother Mariamne, he honored the Law. Like <b>the</b> <b>merest</b> commoner, he carried his basket of first-fruits to the Temple; with the people he celebrated appropriately the Feast of Tabernacles, and he devoted to the sanctuary a golden chain with which Caligula had honored him. On one occasion, while in the street, he met a bridal procession which drew up to let him pass, but he halted and bade it take precedence. He sought to lighten taxation, remitting the impost on houses in Jerusalem. On the coins minted by him he carefully avoided placing any symbols which could offend the people's religious sentiment. Thus, prosperity and comfort seemed to be dawning anew for the Jews.|$|E

He would have more {{influence}} on the young Marcus than any other person.From my father: gentleness and unshaken resolution in judgments taken after full examination; no vainglory about external honours; love of work and perseverance; readiness to hear those who had anything {{to contribute to the}} public advantage; the desire to reward every man according to his desert without partiality; the experience that knew where to tighten the reign, where to relax. Prohibition of unnatural practices, social tact and permission to his suite not invariably to be present at his banquets nor to attend his progress from Rome, as a matter of obligation, and always to be found the same by those who had failed to attend him through engagements. Exact scrutiny in council and patience; not that he was avoiding investigation, satisfied with first impressions. An inclination to keep his friends, and nowhere fastidious or the victim of manias but his own master in everything, and his outward mien cheerful. His long foresight and ordering of <b>the</b> <b>merest</b> trifle without making scenes. The check in his reign put upon organized applause and every form of lip-service; his unceasing watch over the needs of the empire and his stewardship of its resources; his patience under criticism by individuals of such conduct. No superstitious fear of divine powers nor with man any courting of the public or obsequiousness or cultivation of popular favour, but temperance in all things and firmness; nowhere want of taste or search for novelty.|$|E

Yet its mechanism remains unknown. In Experiments 1 - 5, memory encoding was examined to determine whether <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> exposure effect was a form of conceptual or perceptual implicit priming, and, if not either, whether cardiovascular psychophysiology could reveal its nature. Experiment 1 examined the effects of study phase level of processing on recognition, <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> exposure effect, and word identification implicit priming. Deep relative to shallow processing improved recognition, but did not influence <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> exposure effect or word identification implicit priming. Experiments 2 and 3 examined the effect of study-test changes in font and orientation, respectively, on <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> exposure effect and word identification implicit priming. Different study-test font and orientation reduced word identification implicit priming, but had no influence on <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> exposure effect. <b>The</b> combined results from Experiments 1 - 3 suggested that conceptual and perceptual processing do not drive <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> exposure effect. Experiments 4 and 5 developed and used, respectively, an innovative cardiovascular psychophysiological implicit priming paradigm to examine whether stimulus-specific cardiovascular reactivity at study predicted <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> exposure effect at test. At encoding, stimulus-specific peripheral vasodilatation had predictive value for <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> exposure effect, but not for word identification implicit priming. Experiments 6 and 7 examined whether sustained or transitory anxiety (i. e., trait or state, respectively) would influence <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> exposure effect. Greater trait and state anxiety reduced <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> exposure effect. Together, the findings from these experiments (N = 362) identify a novel affective mechanism of implicit priming that is influenced by cardiovascular psychophysiology and variations in trait and state anxiety...|$|R

He became a star whose characters were good looking, quick witted, funny and athletic, a star whose characters seemed to win the hearts of women without even trying". Martin Stirling, commenting in the biography Cary Grant: In Name Only, thought that Grant had an acting range which was [...] "greater than any of his contemporaries, but understood why a number of critics underrated him as an actor. He believes that Grant was always at his [...] "physical and verbal best in situations that bordered on farce". Charles Champlin, commenting in Donald Deschner's The Complete Films of Cary Grant (1973) similarly identifies a paradox in Grant's screen persona, in his unusual ability to [...] "mix polish and pratfalls in successive scenes". He remarks that Grant was [...] "refreshingly able to play the near-fool, the fey idiot, without compromising his masculinity or surrendering to camp for its own sake. His ability to play off against his own image as the strong and handsome romantic hero-figure is, as a matter of fact, probably unique among superstars. Nobody else comes even close to mind who could similarly toy with his own dignity without losing it". Wansell further notes that Grant could, [...] "with the arch of an eyebrow or <b>the</b> <b>merest</b> hint of a smile, question his own image", managing to [...] "blend irony and romance in a way that few other stars have ever done, by slyly never appearing to take himself too seriously, and mixing his own unique mixture of naïveté and worldliness". Stanley Donen, a director who had worked with Grant, stated that his real [...] "magic" [...] came from his attention to minute details and always seeming real, which came from [...] "enormous amounts of work" [...] rather than being God-given. Grant remarked of his career: [...] "I guess to a certain extent I did eventually become the characters I was playing. I played at being someone I wanted to be until I became that person, Or he became me". He would later profess that the real Cary Grant was more like his scruffy, unshaven fisherman in Father Goose than the [...] "well-tailored charmer" [...] of Charade.|$|E

50|$|Where land {{similar to}} that of Martin Mere, gently undulating glacial till, becomes flooded and {{develops}} fen and bog, the remnants of <b>the</b> original <b>mere</b> remain until <b>the</b> whole is filled with peat. This can be delayed where <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> is fed by lime-rich water from chalk or limestone upland and a significant proportion of the outflow from <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> takes <b>the</b> form of evaporation. In these circumstances, the lime (typically calcium carbonate) is deposited on the peaty bed and inhibits plant growth therefore peat formation. A typical feature of these meres is that they are alongside a river rather than having the river flowing through them. In this way, <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> is replenished by seepage from the bed of the lime-rich river, through the river's natural levée, or by winter floods. The water of <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> is then static through the summer, when the concentration of the calcium carbonate rises until it is precipitated on the bed of <b>the</b> <b>mere.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Fur {{was mostly}} worn as an inner lining for warmth; {{inventories}} from Burgundian villages show that even there a fur-lined coat (rabbit, {{or the more}} expensive cat) {{was one of the}} most common garments. Vair, the fur of the squirrel, white on the belly and grey on the back, was particularly popular through most of the century and can be seen in many illuminated manuscript illustrations, where it is shown as a white and blue-grey softly striped or checkered pattern lining cloaks and other outer garments; the white belly fur with <b>the</b> <b>merest</b> edging of grey was called miniver. [...] A fashion in men's clothing for the dark furs sable and marten arose around 1380, and squirrel fur was thereafter relegated to formal ceremonial wear. Ermine, with their dense white winter coats, was worn by royalty, with the black tipped tails left on to contrast with the white for decorative effect, as in the Wilton Diptych above.|$|E

He was described before the tour as [...] "Probably the best bowler in the West Indies, using his head to great advantage. Hard hitting, run-getting bat". On the tour he was second in the bowling averages marginally behind Float Woods and leading wicket taker with 78. He had one good innings of 64* against the Gentlemen of the M.C.C. but otherwise his batting was disappointing. Compared to Woods he was [...] "generally thought in England to be the better bowler of the two. His length was always excellent, and he possessed more finesse and head work than the Trinidad bowler. He sent down a good yorker, and it was with this ball that he twice had the honour of bowling W.G. Though Woods headed him by <b>the</b> <b>merest</b> fraction in the bowling analyses, it was pretty generally admitted that Burton on the whole accomplished the best work".|$|E

When the waters had swelled 150 days, God remembered Noah and the beasts, and God caused a wind to blow and the waters to recede {{steadily}} from the earth, and the Ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. At the end of 40 days, Noah opened the window and sent out a raven, and it went to and fro. Then he sent out a dove to see if the waters had decreased from the ground, but the dove could not find a resting place, and returned to the Ark. He waited another seven days, and again sent out the dove, and the dove came back toward evening with an olive leaf. He waited another seven days and sent out the dove, and it did not return.
