5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or {{medicine}} was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> know if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E

500|$|The 48-page {{prestige}} format one-shot comic took {{a considerable}} amount of time to produce. Both Moore and Bolland are well known for their meticulous and time-consuming work; both creators' then-recently finished 12-issue maxiseries titles—Moore's Watchmen and Bolland's Camelot 3000—had seen delays. He was aided by the laid back attitude taken by DC, who he says [...] "seemed prepared <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> do it at my own pace." [...] The original editor, Len Wein, left the company, and was replaced by Dennis O'Neil, a [...] "very hands-off sort of guy," [...] with whom Bolland only recalls having one conversation about the book.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Wagner's indignation {{found its}} way at last into words. [...] "I {{deserved}} this," [...] she said, [...] "when I allowed you <b>to</b> speak <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> pass, if you please." ...|$|R
500|$|The crowd became {{steadily}} younger over time. In the 1990s, {{when her}} parents still operated the bar, Barisich {{asked if she could}} sell a case of what was then considered premium beer. She recalled, [...] "I convinced them <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> buy a case of Heineken's, which at that time sold for unheard-of price of a buck a bottle. My dad said that people would never pay that much for a bottle of beer, and they'd only let me buy the case if I promised to drink what didn't sell." [...] Her introduction of premium beer proved to be successful. Lutz would soon be recognized by Blitz-Weinhard for serving more Blitz beer than any other establishment.|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Davis {{recounted the}} {{circumstances}} of her husband's capture as described below: [...] "Just before day the enemy charged our camp yelling like demons... I pleaded with him <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> throw over him a large waterproof wrap which had often served him in sickness during the summer season for a dressing gown and which I hoped might so cover his person that in the grey of the morning {{he would not be}} recognized. As he strode off I threw over his head a little black shawl which was around my own shoulders, saying that he could not find his hat and after he started sent my colored woman after him with a bucket for water hoping that he would pass unobserved." ...|$|E
500|$|Age of Empires IIIs {{multiplayer}} was {{the first}} in the series to be integrated into the game interface and was highly lauded, as was the Home City concept. The topic of multiplayer was touched by GameZone, who said [...] "this game demands multiplayer mode, and Ensemble Studios provided this for the players," [...] while at 1UP, the reviewer commented similarly, stating, [...] "Multiplayer support has been significantly upgraded with a slick interface, support for clans {{and a number of other}} useful features." [...] GameSpy commented on the Home City as well, saying, [...] "the 'home city' system creates long-term depth and strategy." [...] EuroGamer, however, stated: [...] "Stop with the gifts!...You do not need <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> flick to a home city screen every few minutes so that I can select a free unit or resource windfall. I'm not some spoilt toddler that needs to be bribed with endless sweeties." [...] Age of empires III uses the ESO server for multiplayer.|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Ten were completed in May 1991. Krusen left the band once the sessions were completed, checking himself into rehabilitation. According to Krusen, {{he was suffering}} from personal problems at the time. Krusen said, [...] "It was a great experience. I felt from the beginning of that band that it was something special," [...] and added, [...] "They had <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go. I couldn't stop drinking, and it was causing problems. They gave me many chances, but I couldn't get it together." [...] In June, the band joined Tim Palmer in England for mixing. Palmer decided to mix the album at Ridge Farm Studios in Dorking, a converted farm that according to Palmer was [...] "about as far away from an L.A. or New York studio as you can get." [...] Palmer made a few additions to the already-recorded songs, including having McCready finish up the guitar solo on [...] "Alive" [...] and tweaking the intro to [...] "Black". Palmer overdubbed a pepper shaker and a fire extinguisher as percussion on [...] "Oceans".|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast, American stunt performer and Jackass actor Johnny Knoxville guest starred in the episode {{as the voice of}} Johnny Krill, the leader of an extreme sports team called the Drasticals and a champion of undersea extreme sports. The writing staff wrote the episode specifically for Knoxville. Executive producer Paul Tibbitt said [...] " [...] wanted to do a show about extreme sports and the first thing that came to mind was Johnny Knoxville, because there are few humans living that are as extreme as him." [...] Knoxville accepted the role because he is a fan of the show. Knoxville said [...] "I got a lot of street cred in the office for doing SpongeBob. Everyone is psyched As soon as I was done recording this episode, I started begging them <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> come back and record another one." [...] Knoxville asked if he needed {{to come up with a}} funny voice for his character. However, the producers said [...] "No, we want [...]" [...] Knoxville claimed that [...] "it's not easy" [...] providing a vocal cameo. He added [...] "It's a different kind of work." ...|$|E

It's obvious now that you must, if possible, find the ore; and yet you object <b>to</b> <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> help. If you give up the search and return to Toronto, {{it may be a}} very long time before you can make another trip." ...|$|R

500|$|Interviewed by Oriana Fallaci in 1965, Connery {{identified}} {{where he}} had altered the character for the films, saying [...] "I said to the producers that the character had one defect, there was no humor about him; to get him accepted, they'd have <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> play him tongue-in-cheek, so people could laugh. They agreed, and there you are: today Bond is accepted {{to such an extent}} that even philosophers take the trouble to analyze him, even intellectuals enjoy defending him or attacking him. And even while they're laughing at him, people take him terribly seriously". Connery went on to add that [...] "Bond is important: this invincible superman that every man would like to copy, that every woman would like to conquer, this dream we all have of survival. And then one can't help liking him". After the pressures of five films in six years, Connery left the role after the 1967 film You Only Live Twice saying, [...] "It became a terrible pressure, like living in a goldfish bowl... that was part of the reason I wanted to be finished with Bond. Also I had become completely identified with it, and it became very wearing and very boring".|$|E
500|$|When it {{came time}} to record a lead single, Yankovic once again turned his {{attention}} to Michael Jackson. Jackson had just released his album Bad, a follow-up to 1983's immensely successful album Thriller. After Yankovic first heard the lead single, [...] "Bad", he immediately envisioned a parody entitled [...] "Fat". Initially, Yankovic didn't want to record another Michael Jackson parody. He later said, [...] "I was still primarily known as the 'Eat It' guy and I didn't want to become known as the guy who just rides Michael's coattails." [...] He later relented and sought out Jackson for permission. Jackson, a fan of Yankovic's work, had already let Yankovic parody his 1983 hit single [...] "Beat It". When presented with the new potential parody, Jackson not only approved it, but let Yankovic use his own Moonwalker subway set for the music video. Yankovic later presented Jackson with a gold record of Even Worse after the album sold over 500,000 copies. Jackson was so pleased with the song and video, he ordered twelve copies to give to his friends. [...] Yankovic later said, [...] "He doesn't have <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> do this kind of stuff. [...] The only reason he would let me is because he has a great sense of humor." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Say Yes" [...] is an uptempo gospel {{song with}} {{elements}} of pop music. The song was also noted for exploring elements of Contemporary Christian {{as well as}} electronic dance music. Jeff Benjamin of Fuse felt that the song contained a [...] "zippy", reggae-dance beat. Its instrumentation includes percussion instruments, synths and horn stabs along with African beats. According to sheet music published on the website Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing America, Inc., [...] "Say Yes" [...] is written in the key of D major using common time. It contains a moderately fast tempo with a metronome of 120 beats per minute and the singers' vocal elements range from the low note of A3 to the high note of F5. The song samples a popular Nigerian gospel tune originally titled [...] "When Jesus Says Yes". Chris Payne and Colin Stutz of Billboard magazine {{described it as a}} modern dance and contemporary electronic dance reworking of that song. Stutz also found elements of an [...] "upbeat swing" [...] of West African gospel. Regarding the composition of the song, Williams stated, [...] "It is a song that came from Africa {{more than a hundred years}} ago. I don't think anyone knows who wrote it or who started singing that chorus. When the song leaked last week, so many people from Africa and Nigeria were trying <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> know where it came from." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let {{her show}} herself. How do I {{know who is}} {{speaking}} <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> see her face again." [...] He added this in a gentler voice, being moved by a vivid memory of the exquisite picture Altair had made.|$|R

500|$|Sean Young was {{originally}} cast as Vicki Vale, but {{was injured in}} a horse-riding accident prior to commencement of filming. Young's departure necessitated an urgent search for an actress who, besides being right for the part, could commit to the film at very short notice. Peters suggested Kim Basinger: {{she was able to}} join the production immediately and was cast. As a fan of Michael Gough's work in various Hammer Film Productions, Burton cast Gough as Bruce Wayne's butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Robert Wuhl was cast as reporter Alexander Knox. His character {{was originally}} supposed to die by the Joker's poison gas in the climax, but the filmmakers [...] "liked [...] character so much," [...] Wuhl said, [...] "that they decided <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> live." [...] Burton chose Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent because he wanted to include the villain Two-Face in a future film using the concept of an African-American Two-Face for the black and white concept, but Tommy Lee Jones was later cast in the role for Batman Forever, which disappointed Williams. Nicholson convinced the filmmakers to cast his close friend Tracey Walter as the Joker's henchman, Bob. Kiefer Sutherland was considered as Robin before the character was deleted from the shooting script. The rest of the cast included Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon, Jerry Hall as Alicia Hunt, Lee Wallace as Mayor Borg, William Hootkins as Lt. Max Eckhardt, and Jack Palance as crime boss Carl Grissom.|$|E
2500|$|Ashby {{promoted}} Michael Chapman, {{his camera}} operator on The Landlord, [...] to director of photography. They {{worked together to}} create a specific look for the film that involved using natural light to create a realistic, documentary-style. Ashby let Nicholson look through the camera's viewfinder as a shot was being set up so he knew the parameters of a given scene and how much freedom he had within the frame. The actor said, [...] "Hal is the first director <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go, <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> find my own level".|$|E

2500|$|Though Hopper gave {{critically}} acclaimed performances in Coppola's Rumble Fish (1983) and Sam Peckinpah's The Osterman Weekend (1983), {{it was not}} until he portrayed the gas-huffing, obscenity-screaming iconic villain Frank Booth in David Lynch's Blue Velvet (1986) that his career truly revived. On reading the script Hopper said to Lynch: [...] "You have <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> play Frank Booth. Because I am Frank Booth!" [...] He won critical acclaim and several awards for this role, and in the same year received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as an alcoholic assistant basketball coach in Hoosiers.|$|E
