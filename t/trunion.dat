50|$|Universal joints let {{the shaft}} keep {{rotating}} while allowing for changes due to suspension movement, such as shaft length and horizontal angle, and shaft angle as the steering turns. Constant-velocity universal joints are normally used to transfer power smoothly between the components. The inner universal {{can be a}} plunge or tripod type joint. The tripod is splined to the intermediate shaft and held by a circlip. A ball, supported on needle roller bearings, is fitted to each post of the tripod, and these slide in a <b>trunion</b> inside the yoke. This caters for changes in shaft length and horizontal angle. The drive is transferred through the <b>trunion</b> and balls to rotate the shaft.|$|E

The 76 mm M1A1 version of the cannon was created, having a longer recoil surface to also help with balance by permitting {{the placement of the}} <b>trunions</b> further up front.|$|R
5000|$|The third bridge on-site was a <b>trunioned</b> {{double-leaf}} bascule drawbridge {{with its}} counterweights {{in a closed}} pit underneath, built between 1921 and 1924. [...] It was designed by engineer Ernest W. Wiggin of New Haven in the Beaux-Arts style, based on a bascule design by Joseph B. Strauss. [...] Before {{the completion of the}} adjacent Q Bridge, it was carrying 30,000 vehicles a day. [...] When closed, clearance under the bridge was 12 ft at mean high water, ranging from 8 - 17 ft at extreme high tide to extreme low tide. [...] The channel width was 117 ft, with a total span length between centers of 148 ft. [...] The builder was the Phoenix Bridge Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|$|R

50|$|Jahan Kosha Cannon (also {{known as}} the Great Gun) {{literally}} means the Destroyer of the World. It {{is placed in the}} Topekhana a quarter of mile to the south east of the Katra Mosque, in the town of Murshidabad, West Bengal, India. Topekhana was the Nawab's Artillery Park and the entrance gate of the old capital of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, the city of Jahangir Nagar. It is protected on the east by the Gobra Nala, locally {{known as the}} Katra Jheel. Here, the Jahan Kosha Cannon is laid to rest. Earlier, it rested on a carriage with wheels and was surrounded by the roots of a Peepal tree. Gradually, this cannon had been lifted four feet from the ground The roots surrounded it so beautifully that it had no possibility of falling down. It used to be astonishing to see the big and heavy cannon hanging at a height of 4 feet. Later, it was freed from the tree's roots. The wheels have disappeared but the iron-work of the carriage and the <b>trunions</b> are still visible. The cannon is made of ashtadhatu or 8 metals, namely silver, gold, lead, copper, zinc, tin, iron and mercury.|$|R
40|$|AbstractHeavy wall {{reactors}} {{and large}} diameter pressure vessels usually face unique challenges in their erection onto their foundations at the jobsite. Today, 800 ton to 1, 500 ton reactors and or large diameter vessels with diameters ranging up to 15 meters {{are common in}} the refining industry. These pressure vessels are usually fabricated in shops dispersed globally and require unique heavy duty equipment for their safe handling, transportation and erection. The challenge {{is to find a}} safe, efficient and cost effective solution based upon the limitations of the equipment, job site and the lift equipment available for erection. Equipment for the handling heavy reactors and large diameter pressure equipment is usually scarce, expensive. Planning well in advance of the lift date is required. Careful consideration must be given to the choice and design of attachment to the pressure vessels used for the lift to ensure that the vessel and lifting components are not overstressed during the lifting process. This paper identifies the types of evaluations that must be performed to determine the stresses in the vessel and lifting attachments during the lifting. The paper also discusses different types of lifting lugs that may be attached to each end of the vessel either by bolting or welding and discusses {{the pros and cons of}} each. The paper also provides an example of a finite element analysis (FEA) of a top nozzle, a FEA of a pair of lifting <b>trunions</b> and a FEA of welded on lifting lugs for buried pipe. The intent of the paper is to outline the effects on the vessel due to different types of lifting configurations in combination with the lifting parameters. This paper is not intended to provide guidance on how to design lifting lugs...|$|R
50|$|A ball {{tube mill}} may be {{described}} as a cylinder made of steel plates having separate heads or trunions attached to the ends with each <b>trunion</b> resting on suitable bearings for supporting the machine. The trunions are hollow to allow for the introduction of discharge of the materials undergoing reduction in size. The mill shell is lined with chilled iron, carbon steel, manganese steel, or high chrome liners attached to shell body with counter sunk bolts. These liners are made in different shapes so that the counter inside surface of the mill is suited for requirement of a particular application.|$|E
5000|$|The Intelligence Corps' Centennial Cannon was {{produced}} by Compton House Limited as an operational muzzle-loading cannon to be fired for the Canadian Centennial. It is a George III one-pounder, however it carries the Canadian Intelligence Corps crest {{in place of the}} George III cipher. Two C INT C [...] "collar dogs" [...] are mounted on the forward face of the carriage. The squat 30-inch barrel is mounted on an oak carriage, fitted with bronze wheels, <b>trunion</b> caps and hardware. The barrel is cast in iron, with drawn steel bore tube for reinforcement.

50|$|In 1943, {{the battery}} {{opened fire on}} a target, Gun no. 4 broke its <b>trunion</b> rings after two rounds and Gun no. 3 {{suffered}} the same fate one round later. Gun no.1 was also put out of action due to a damaged recoil mechanism, the guns had been firing 250 kg HE shells using a 71 kg cartridge at 31ยบ. Engineers were flown in, spare parts were sourced from the Baltic and repairs were completed within the month. The armour plating on the turret roof was improved to 150mm during the repair period. Risk of damage was always a factor in deciding whether to fire, as was the limited life span of the barrels which {{would need to be}} returned to the factory to have the internal grooved bore replaced.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004 ADB {{introduced}} WARP Profile - In this ellipsoidal profile spot conventional shutters {{have been}} replaced by 4 integrated blades controlled by a series of rings, each with 360โฐ endless rotation capability. Focus and Zoom settings are also controlled by a set of dedicated rings. The ring controls leave the exterior of the WARP spotlight with no protruding handles or levers. The design of the WARP allows the standard <b>trunion</b> arms to be replaced with a motorised yoke. This yoke links also into the ring controls providing automation of all other functions - focus & zoom, shutter insertion / rotation and gobo rotation. The motorised unit is without any forced ventilation (fans) and completely silent, making the unit ideal for acoustic critical applications (TV studios, concert halls et al.) ...|$|E
50|$|The Saiga {{uses the}} same type of gas system that the AK series rifle uses: Long-stroke piston. A piston is pushed by the force of the gases from the firearm when a round is discharged, and it keeps powder residue and carbon from impeding the action of the Saiga. It is widely {{accepted}} that this type of action provides greater reliability than most other semi automatic actions. This piston is located inside the gas tube. As gas is siphoned into the gas tube, the gas piston is sent rearward. While the gas piston is sent rearward, the bolt, attached to the gas piston, is unlocked from the <b>trunion</b> and ejects the spent casing. When the bolt and gas piston reach the rearmost position of the receiver, the recoil spring pushes them forward again picking up a new round and chambers it, and the cycle repeats when the trigger is pulled.|$|E
50|$|The first orbiting, {{unmanned}} {{satellite to}} be repaired in space, SMM was notable in that its useful life compared with similar spacecraft was significantly increased by the direct intervention of a manned space mission. During STS-41-C in April 1984, the Space Shuttle Challenger rendezvoused with the SMM, astronauts James van Hoften and George Nelson attempted {{to use the}} Manned Maneuvering Unit to capture the satellite and to bring it into the orbiter's payload bay for repairs and servicing. The plan was to use an astronaut-piloted Maneuvering Unit to grapple the satellite with the <b>Trunion</b> Pin Attachment Device (TPAD) mounted between the hand controllers of the Maneuvering Unit, null its rotation rates, and allow the Shuttle to bring it into the Shuttle's payload bay for stowage. Three attempts to grapple the satellite using the TPAD failed. The TPAD jaws could not lock onto Solar Max because of an obstructing grommet on the satellite not included in its blueprints.|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{achievements}} of the Dolphin he {{came to the attention of}} Mickey Thompson, who was well known for involvement in drag racing, land speed record attempts and motor racing. Thompson and his sponsors, Harvey Aluminium and Jim Kimberly (of Kimberly Clark), asked Crosthwaite to design a car to race in the 1962 Indianapolis 500. Unusually they used a stock V8 Buick engine and it was in the rear unlike the front-engined, race tuned, Offenhauser powered cars used by most competitors. It was the first stock engine to be raced at Indy since 1946 and was the beginning of the rear engine transformation at the Indianapolis 500. The car had 16-inch wheels instead of the usual 18"/20" [...] seen at Indy and fully independent suspension. The only thing in common with the Dolphin was the NSU lower front suspension <b>trunion.</b> Thompson's crew led by Fritz Voigt were young, smart and hard working. Working 12-14 hour days, the car was designed and built in 120 days. Crosthwaite lived in a local motel and was rarely home. For the race, the engine (enlarged to 4.2-litre capacity, the maximum allowed by the regulations for โstock blockโ engines) had to be detuned because they were concerned it would not last the distance. Despite being more than 70 bhp down on the other cars Dan Gurney qualified eighth and was in ninth place until a leaking oil seal seized the gearbox and ended his race on lap 94. He was placed 20th out of 33. The team won the Mechanical Achievement Award for original design, construction and accomplishment.|$|E
50|$|In 1966, the US Air Force {{developed}} an Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU), a self-contained rocket pack {{very similar to}} the MMU. This was planned to be tested during Project Gemini on an EVA by Eugene Cernan on Gemini 9A on June 5, 1966. However, the test had to be cancelled because Cernan, tired and overheated, sweated so profusely that his helmet visor fogged before he could get to the AMU mounted {{on the back of the}} spacecraft. Astronauts did not learn how to work during EVA without tiring until the final Gemini 12 mission, but no AMU was carried on that flight. Since there was no real need for self-contained astronaut EVA flight in the Apollo and Skylab programs, the idea had to wait for the advent of the Space Shuttle program, though several maneuvering device designs were tested inside Skylab.The MMU was used on three Shuttle missions in 1984. It was first tested on February 7 during mission STS-41-B by astronauts Bruce McCandless II and Robert L. Stewart. Two months later during mission STS-41-C, astronauts James van Hoften and George Nelson attempted to use the MMU to capture the Solar Maximum Mission satellite and to bring it into the orbiter's payload bay for repairs and servicing. The plan was to use an astronaut-piloted MMU to grapple the SMM with the <b>Trunion</b> Pin Attachment Device (TPAD) mounted between the hand controllers of the MMU, null its rotation rates, and allow the Shuttle to bring it into the Shuttle's payload bay for stowage. Three attempts to grapple the satellite using the TPAD failed. The TPAD jaws could not lock onto Solar Max because of an obstructing grommet on the satellite not included in the blueprints for the satellite. This led to an improvised plan which nearly ended the satellite's mission. The improvisation had the MMU astronaut use his hands to grab hold of an SMM solar array and null the rates by a push from MMU's thrusters. Instead, this attempt induced higher rates and in multiple axes; the satellite was tumbling out of control and quickly losing battery life. SMM Operations Control Center engineers shut down all non-essential SMM subsystems and with a bit of luck were able to recover the SMM minutes before total failure. The ground support engineers then stabilized the satellite and nulled its rotation rates for capture with the orbiter's robotic arm, the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS). This proved to be a much better plan. Their successful work increased the lifespan of the satellite.|$|E
40|$|This is a {{retrospective}} review of two series {{of using the}} same stem and modular neck design (R- 120 โข) with the exception that the second series had an improved modular neck construct. Model I, 145 stems implanted between 2002 and 2005. Taper neck problems consisted of two neck <b>trunion</b> fractures at the neck stem junction and one modular neck disassociation at the modular junction. Stem was withdrawn from the market and redesigned to a more robust structure. Model II, 188 stems were implanted between 2007 and 2011 by the senior author utilizing the same surgical technique. There have been no modular neck taper problems. This paper will demonstrate that once a modular junction problem has been identified corrective action {{can be taken to}} resolve the problem. We advocate that there is a benefit to a modular neck cemented stem design and all modular junctions are not equal in design or function...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of implantology, is {{recognized}} that microleakage at abutment/implant interface may cause inflammatory reactions in the peri-implant tissue. Although its established that microorganisms cause corrosion on metals in water environments, the role of bacteria at corrosion of dental alloys is unknown. The corrosion may result in biological, functional and aesthetic effects. The aim of this in vitro experiment is to evaluate the microleakage and corrosion by Streptococcus mutans at implant/abutment interface. The evaluated abutments are the following: premachined UCLA of Ag-Pd, premachined UCLA of tilite, calcinable UCLA of Co-Cr, calcinable UCLA of tilite, tilite preparable <b>trunion</b> and titanium preparable <b>trunion.</b> The inner of implants were contaminated with Streptococcus mutans culture. The abutments were screwed on implants, receiving closing torques of 32 N. cm and immerse in thioglycolate, keeping incubated for 28 days. The microleakage was evaluated in each 24 hours, for 14 days. After that, the culture environments that werent bleary were contaminated. The culture environments were analyzed in the 7 th, 14 th and 28 th days, with atomic absorption spectrophotometry, for corrosion analyze. With exception of the prosthetic component of Ag-Pd, all the tested components had {{an increase in the}} corrosion when immersed in way contend Streptococcus mutans, of significant form or not, and the premachined UCLA of Ag-Pd presented higher percentage of microleakage (40 %), but without difference significant statistics for the others tested groups.

40|$|The Part Task Trainer program (PTT) is a {{kinematic}} {{simulation of}} the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) for the orbiter. The {{purpose of the}} PTT is to supply a low cost man-in-the-loop simulator, allowing the student to learn operational procedures which then {{can be used in}} the more expensive full scale simulators. PTT will allow the crew members to work on their arm operation skills without the need for other people running the simulation. The controlling algorithms for the arm were coded out of the Functional Subsystem Requirements Document to ensure realistic operation of the simulation. Relying on the hardware of the workstation to provide fast refresh rates for full shaded images allows the simulation to be run on small low cost stand alone work stations, removing the need to be tied into a multi-million dollar computer for the simulation. PTT will allow the student to make errors which in full scale mock up simulators might cause failures or damage hardware. On the screen the user is shown a graphical representation of the RMS control panel in the aft cockpit of the orbiter, along with a main view window and up to six <b>trunion</b> and guide windows. The dials drawn on the panel may be turned to select the desired mode of operation. The inputs controlling the arm are read from a chair with a Translational Hand Controller (THC) and a Rotational Hand Controller (RHC) attached to it...|$|E
40|$|Gas and Liquid samples {{have been}} {{collected}} from a selection of the approximately 3, 820 spent fuel storage canisters in the K West Basin. The samples were taken to characterize {{the contents of the}} gas and water in the canisters providing source term information for two subprojects of the Spent Nuclear Fuel Project (SNFP) (Fulton 1994) : the K Basins Integrated Water Treatment System Subproject (Ball 1996) and the K Basins Fuel Retrieval System Subproject (Waymire 1996). The barrels of ten canisters were sampled for gas and liquid in 1995, and 50 canisters were sampled in a second campaign in 1996. The analysis results from the first campaign have been reported (Trimble 1995 a, 1995 b, 1996 a, 1996 b). The analysis results from the second campaign liquid samples have been documented (Trimble and Welsh 1997; Trimble 1997). This report documents the results for the gas samples from the second campaign and evaluates all gas data in terms of expected releases when opening the canisters for SNFP activities. The fuel storage canisters consist of two closed and sealed barrels, each with a gas trap. The barrels are attached at a <b>trunion</b> to make a canister, but are otherwise independent (Figure 1). Each barrel contains up to seven N Reactor fuel element assemblies. A gas space of nitrogen was established in the top 2. 2 to 2. 5 inches (5. 6 to 6. 4 cm) of each barrel. Many of the fuel elements were damaged allowing the metallic uranium fuel to be corroded by the canister water. The corrosion releases fission products and generates hydrogen gas. The released gas mixes with the gas-space gas and excess gas passes through the gas trap into the basin water. The canister design does not allow canister water to be exchanged with basin water...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that an individual 2 ฬ 7 s past experiences may interact with current reinforcement contingencies affecting that individual 2 ฬ 7 s response rate differently than what might be predicted if the current contingency were the sole determinant of the individual 2 ฬ 7 s behavior. If this is accurate, then there would be considerable benefit in understanding past experiences which affect response rate before initiating new teaching strategies. Since schedules of reinforcement have a profound effect upon rate of response, it is appropriate to examine behavior maintained by a known schedule of reinforcement as a function of various prior experiences. ^ One population that such investigations might particularly benefit is employees of sheltered workshops. A major reason for individuals working in a sheltered workshop and not moving into competitive work is low rate of response. These individuals do not produce fast enough for the competitive labor market. If this low rate of responding were viewed as a function of reinforcement history rather than as an inherent defect of the individual, then it would seem appropriate to determine if, by systematically altering that history, this problem of slow responding might be avoided or at least minimized. ^ This study identified those individuals who, after reaching criterion on a nut and <b>trunion</b> work sample, functioned either as a high rate or low rate responder, as compared to a standard measure of response rate. The rate of production was utilized as the dependent variable. The group of high rate responders were divided into two sub-groups. One received reinforcement for high rates of responding (DRH), while {{the other half of the}} high rate group received reinforcement for low rates of responding, i. e., differential reinforcement for low rates of responding (DRL). ^ The low rate producers were likewise divided into two sub-groups and exposed to similar treatment, i. e., one-half the group was reinforced for high rates of responding, the other half will be reinforced for low rates of responding. ^ In the final treatment period all groups were subjected to the same conditions of reinforcement, variable ratio three (VR(, 3)). This period allowed the examination of the influence of past schedules of reinforcement upon a current schedule of reinforcement as measured by production rate. ^ The main effects were analyzed as follows: Initial response rate (history) (high and low production groups) in Period I; initial response rate (history) x schedule (DRL or DRH) in Period II; and initial response rate (history) x schedule (DRL or DRH) x present schedule (VR(, 3)) in Period III. Treatment effects were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA in Period I, and a two-factor ANOVA in Period II. A two-factor mixed design with repeated measures on one-factor ANOVA was used in Period III. In addition to the analysis of the main effects several post-hoc comparisons were made. ^ The results of the research can be used to support an assumption that the initial response rate (history) and systemically developed history significantly effect the response rate of adult mentally retarded sheltered workshop employees under current treatment conditions. This study suggests that depending on the individual 2 ฬ 7 s history, the type of current treatment will be more or less effective in shaping behavior. While all reinforcement schedules shaped behavior in the direction that might be predicted, there was considerable variation, which appeared to be directly related to the individual 2 ฬ 7 s history. ...|$|E
