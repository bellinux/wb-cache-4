5|$|After some time, Neto's {{parents and}} sister visit him, and are deceived by {{the doctor who}} says Neto {{requires}} months of treatment. Neto begs his parents to take him with them and they refuse. Days later, Neto tries to escape but is captured and receives electric shock treatment. Suddenly, in another day, his father visits him to say he and Meire are missing him; Neto asks to leave the place and Wilson takes him away. At home, his mother asks a downcast Neto {{if he wants to}} return <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>or</b> to work as a salesman; he decides to work. The mother of one of his friends forbids Neto to see him, and he discovers Leninha is a married woman. Then, he becomes distressed to the point of leaving a client {{in the midst of a}} sale. To unwind, Neto goes to a party at night, where he mixes Coca-Cola and cachaça. Drunk, he carries his friend Bel to the bathroom and they start to kiss each other. However, he goes berserk and starts to damage the place. The police are called and send him to another psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{conclusion}} of the Gator Bowl, Vick was asked by an NBC broadcaster if he intended to return to Virginia Tech for another year of collegiate football. He responded that he would discuss matters with his family and Tech head coach Frank Beamer before making a decision. That announcement sparked a fresh round of speculation from sports pundits and fans wondering if Vick would choose to return <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>or</b> enter the 2001 NFL Draft. Virginia Tech, through its football coaching staff, began an intensive lobbying campaign in an effort to convince Vick to stay. On January 11, 2001, Vick held a press conference to announce that he would be forgoing his final two years of collegiate eligibility to enter the NFL Draft. Immediately after the announcement, he was predicted to be the No. 1 pick in the draft, a hypothesis realized on April 21, when he was selected by the Atlanta Falcons, who had traded draft picks in order {{to have the right to}} select Vick.|$|E

40|$|Residential {{restrictions}} for {{sex offenders}} {{have become increasingly}} popular, {{despite the lack of}} empirical data suggesting that offenders' proximity <b>to</b> <b>schools</b> <b>or</b> daycares contributes <b>to</b> recidivism. Using a matched sample of recidivists and nonrecidivists from Florida (n = 330) for the period from 2004 through 2006, the authors investigated whether sex offenders who lived closer <b>to</b> <b>schools</b> <b>or</b> daycares were more likely to reoffend sexually against children than those who lived farther away. No {{significant differences were found between}} the distances that recidivists and nonrecidivists lived from schools and daycares. There was no significant relationship between reoffending and proximity <b>to</b> <b>schools</b> <b>or</b> daycares. The results indicate that proximity <b>to</b> <b>schools</b> and daycares, with other risk factors being comparable, does not appear to contribute to sexual recidivism. These data do not support the widespread enactment of residential restrictions for sexual offenders. No Full Tex...|$|R

25|$|Ethnicity, age, education, employment, marital status, and {{location}} are reported factors of delayed breastfeeding and infant under nutrition. Low- income mothers are specifically {{at risk for}} under nutrition and high mortality rates amongst their infants because they replace breast milk with formula. They {{do so because they}} lack a supportive environment, embarrassment of nursing, or the need to return <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>or</b> work. About 16.5% of low-income mothers breastfed for the recommended time. Studies suggest that scarce financial and social resources are consistent with the high mortality rates amongst the infants of low-income mothers.|$|E

25|$|Schools in Newfoundland, {{especially}} in outport settlements, faced many problems and obstacles. The {{success of the}} schools {{was influenced by the}} conditions within the settlement, and these conditions often affected student attendance, payments, learning, and so forth. For example, conditions which affected the population were such things as illnesses (or epidemics) such as the flu, fever, whooping cough, smallpox, measles, etc. The weather also posed problems, severe snowstorms in the winter months often closed schools for days; and if the weather was too cold, children could not make it <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>or</b> could not keep the school in fuel for heat. The fishery affected the school and its attendance greatly. During the fishing season, children were often needed to help out in the fishery and could not attend school. Also, in smaller settlements, the teacher was allowed to attend the fishery in order to supplement their low teaching salaries; therefore, closing the school during that season. A failure in the fishery also had severe consequences as parents could not pay subscriptions to the school. Poverty also led to a lack of clothes and shoes which meant children could not be sent to school. The N.S.S., unlike other schools, tried their best to counter these obstacles. For example, the N.S.S. would send shipments of clothes and shoes from England to Newfoundland to give to poverty-stricken families so their children could continue to attend school. Also, other schools in Newfoundland had trouble procuring and paying qualified teachers. The N.S.S., however, were able to recruite qualified teachers who were trained at the National School Society Training School in England {{and they were able to}} pay their teachers better salaries.|$|E

500|$|In {{a section}} {{apparently}} reprinted from earlier publications, the pamphlet discerns [...] "Reasons for the Growth of Sodomy" [...] {{in a number}} of aspects of British culture. It claims that, in past ages, British middle-class gentlemen had led moral, industrious lives, serving King, country, and family. This era, the pamphlet claims, was now past and lost; the constitution of the gentleman has deteriorated. Contemporary infants, it says, faced grim prospects, being pampered in nurseries by mothers who dominated their weak fathers. Such children, the pamphlet argued, could not help but to grow up effete and were [...] "scarcely worth raising". Some of the blame for this, the pamphlet claims, lay with the increasing popularity of raising children at home, and having them educated by women, rather than sending them <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>or</b> to be apprenticed. Lacking the boisterous companionship of other boys they could not acquire manly traits; governed by women, they never learned to dominate women themselves, which, the pamphlet claimed, was requisite to please a wife.|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1960s, {{parts of}} Launceston have been {{protected}} {{by a series of}} flood levees that reach up to [...] in height. The reason for this is because large portions of Invermay and Newstead sit within a flood plain. The last major flood occurred in 1929 when Invermay was completely devastated. More than 4,000 people were left homeless after just one night of flooding. Since then, there have been minor floods but nothing as severe. Work is under way on a $59million flood levee upgrade that should protect the city from 1-in-200-year events, that is expected to take five to six years to construct. The council has acquired land used by eighteen businesses {{on the south side of}} Lindsay Street in Invermay, with businesses having until July 2009 to leave.

2500|$|The {{reasons for}} this big jump in the 1970s has been {{attributed}} by some scholars to widespread access to the birth control pill. While [...] "the pill" [...] was medically available in the 1960s, numerous laws restricted access to it. See, e.g., Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965) (overturning a Connecticut statute barring access to contraceptives) and Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972) (establishing the right of unmarried people to access contraception). By the 1970s, the age of majority had been lowered from 21 to 18 in the United States, largely {{as a consequence of}} the Vietnam War; this also affected women's right to effect their own medical decisions. Since it had now become socially acceptable to postpone pregnancy even while married, women had the luxury of thinking about other things, like education and work. Also, due to electrification women's work around the house became easier leaving them with more time to be able to dedicate <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>or</b> work. Due to the multiplier effect, even if some women were not blessed with access to the pill or electrification, many followed by the example of the other women entering the work force for those reasons. The Quiet Revolution is called such because it was not a [...] "big bang" [...] revolution; rather, it happened and is continuing to happen gradually.|$|E
