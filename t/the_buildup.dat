40|$|Cryptalgal-bryozoan {{carbonate}} buildups {{are reported}} from the Middle Visean (Upper Dinantian) near Namur, Belgium. They {{occur in a}} 20 m-thick, upward-shallowing, carbonate rhythm - the thickest in a succession of such rhythms. The rhythm comprises three phases; from bottom to top: (1) packstones-grainstones with rich and diverse biota, indicating open, shallow marine conditions; grading to (2) wackestones, with a poorer and more restricted biota, passing upwards to cryptalgal boundstones; and(3) mudstones with highly restricted and reduced biota. Small- to medium- sized mounds (2 - 11 m thick) occur {{at the top of}} Phase 2 where they established on coral thickets. <b>The</b> <b>buildups</b> consist of a meshwork of bryozoans encrusted by finely laminated cryptalgal coatings and encrusting bryozoans. Brachiopods, sponges and vermetid gastropods are also present. Voids were filled by internal sediments and early marine cements. The growth of <b>the</b> <b>buildups</b> was probably interrupted by a short-lived sea-level drop, recorded laterally as {{what seems to be a}} karstic surface. Vadose internal sedimentation and minor leaching by meteoric water occurred in <b>the</b> ?exposed <b>buildups.</b> Marine conditions were then restored and, at the beginning of Phase 3 deposition, coral thickets (with cryptalgal coatings) colonized the top of <b>the</b> largest <b>buildup.</b> Most remaining pore space was filled by burial cements. Other minor diagenetic processes include neomorphism, dolomitization, precipitation of Ca-sulphates and silicification...|$|R
40|$|During the Early Ordovician organic buildups {{formed in}} shallow seas across the world. This project {{contains}} a literature review on these organic buildups {{with a focus}} on those occurring in the warm, shallow seas of North America, but also includes a study on organic <b>buildups</b> formed in <b>the</b> cold water region of Russia. The goal {{of the study was to}} characterize these Early Ordovician organic buildups in order to identify similarities and differences in their occurrence. The second part of this project is a preliminary study on organic <b>buildups</b> occurring in <b>the</b> Early Ordovician Garden City Formation in Boss Canyon, Utah. This project found that warm, shallow-water organic <b>buildups</b> of <b>the</b> Early Ordovician were small scale structures that were typically 1 - 3 meters in height and several meters in width, with the length variable depending on location. <b>The</b> organic <b>buildups</b> were biotically relatively simple structures formed by algae, lithistid sponges and Calathium with accessory organisms of brachiopods, cephalopods, trilobites, echinoderms, gastropods, ostracods, algal remains and conodonts. <b>The</b> organic <b>buildups</b> are composed of massive to faintly-laminated mudstone to wackestone to packstone to boundstone. Large in situ organisms are found on <b>the</b> organic <b>buildups,</b> while internally they are found as skeletal components. Rock surrounding <b>the</b> organic <b>buildups</b> includes limestone and shale. Channels dissect <b>the</b> organic <b>buildups</b> and some organic buildups show evidence of subaerial exposure. Formation of <b>the</b> organic <b>buildups</b> was dependent on local conditions. Cold water organic buildups are several meters long and generally less than a meter high. These organic buildups have a calcareous-clay composition. The mound core is composed of clay topped by a carbonate cap and overlain by a hardground surface. Formation of <b>the</b> organic <b>buildups</b> was by dense concentrations of sessile siliceous sponges. Accessory organisms include brachiopods, echinoderms, ostracods, pelmatozoans, bryozoans and conodonts...|$|R

40|$|Recent debates {{concerning}} {{the origin of}} Emsian carbonate mud buildups exposed at Hamar Laghdad in the eastern Anti-Atlas of Morocco centre around geochemical studies that suggest authigenic or chemosynthetic processes induced precipitation of mud from hydrothermal fluids. Geochemical data alone cannot be used to demonstrate conclusively {{the origin of the}} mud comprising <b>the</b> <b>buildups,</b> but an in situ source and early cementation can be inferred from morphology, internal architecture, and sedimentary structures. Morphological types vary from symmetrical mounds up to 12 m high to asymmetrical pinnacles that locally coalesced, forming elongate multicored complexes up to 56 m high. Their steep-sided nature (margins dipping up to 54 °) and sporadic occurrence of erect invertebrates suggest localized production of mud rather than hydrodynamic piling or baffling from suspension. Irregular nodular beds that thicken internally imply centralized production and a local source for the mud. Displaced nodules and slump folds indicate early cementation of mud to at least a firm consistency, followed by downslope movement. Abrupt termination of carbonate production during late transgression resulted in drowning of <b>the</b> mud <b>buildups</b> and adjacent platform.

40|$|Abstract: <b>The</b> {{workload}} <b>buildup</b> {{flight test}} technique {{is a new}} test technique {{in the field of}} handling qualities. It was introduced by Gray in 2004 and is based on the Boundary Avoidance Tracking (BAT) theory which considers the pilot as someone who tracks away from threatening conditions (boundaries) when they become dominant. <b>The</b> workload <b>buildup</b> flight test technique is basically a modification of conventional head-up display-based tracking tasks. In addition to the target, boundaries are displayed which decrease in regular intervals and must not be exceeded. In addition to the original continuous approach a level-based variant of <b>the</b> workload <b>buildup</b> flight test technique is proposed. Advantages and disadvantages of both approaches as well as associated fields of application are discussed. In the frame of a simulator study with trained test pilots of the German air force several variations of <b>the</b> workload <b>buildup</b> were investigated and their potential for future research was evaluated. These variations include biased or delayed movements of target and boundaries, different representations of the boundary, the possibility to exceed the boundary for a short time as well as visual and aural warnings. This paper summarizes the most important aspects of the task and display variations and provides a starting point for further research in the field of <b>the</b> workload <b>buildup</b> flight test technique...|$|R
