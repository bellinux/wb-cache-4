5|$|More than 1,000schools {{and churches}} were {{converted}} to emergency shelters, but residents only occupied 47 of them before the storm's arrival.

5000|$|The {{concept of}} food miles {{is part of}} the broader issue of {{sustainability}} which deals with a large range of environmental, social and economic issues, including local food. The term was coined by Tim Lang (now Professor of Food Policy, City University, London) who says: [...] "The point was to highlight the hidden ecological, social and economic consequences of food production to consumers in a simple way, one which had objective reality but also connotations." [...] The increased distance traveled by food in developed countries was caused by the globilization of food trade, which increased by 4 times since 1961. Food that is transported by road produces more carbon emissions than any other form of transported food. Road transport produces 60% of <b>the</b> <b>world's</b> <b>food</b> transport carbon emissions. Air transport produces 20% of <b>the</b> <b>world's</b> <b>food</b> transport carbon emissions.

5|$|Portions of {{the country}} faced {{shortages}} of rice due to crop damage from Ernest, {{as well as from}} Cyclone Gafilo in the previous year.

In general, damage from Ernest and Felapi were less than that from Gafilo in the previous year.

5|$|Cyclone Fanele {{struck the}} country during a series of {{government}} protests, and consequently the national government provided little response to the storm. Instead, United Nations (UN) agencies quickly provided relief to affected citizens. <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Food</b> Programme prepared 87metric tons (MT) of cereal and 13MT of various types of pulses. Five United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) trucks arrived in Morondova on January25 with various supplies. In {{the days after the}} storm, contaminated floodwaters resulted in cases of dysentery. To prevent the spread of disease, UNICEF provided vaccines, de-worming tablets, and water cleaning devices. Within three days of the storm's landfall, the agency also began distributing health kits and bed nets. As many schools were affected, UNICEF set up temporary classrooms in tents, while workers began fixing and cleaning the damaged buildings. Despite the quick response by the UN, thousands of people were left without aid. The Malagasy Red Cross deployed its volunteers to affected areas, although disrupted transportation services and the political situation hindered relief efforts.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the floods}} in Costa Rica, the country's Red Cross opened shelters to house storm victims. The {{government}} advised residents not to drink {{water out of}} fear it could be polluted from the flooding. A state of emergency was declared on October18 due to the effects in Costa Rica. In Nicaragua, officials deployed about 3,000soldiers to assist in flood operations. <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Food</b> Programme provided about 8tons of food to families in El Salvador affected by the flooding. Then-president of Honduras Manuel Zelaya declared a national state of emergency on October19. In Honduras, pre-positioned supplies from UNICEF quickly diminished due to the widespread distribution of blankets and medical kits, raising fears for the spread of disease. <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Food</b> Programme provided about 58tons of food to 5,500families in Honduras. Residents returned home as floodwaters gradually receded. The Mercy Corps later provided corn and bean seeds to 1,300Honduran farmers to regrow the damaged crops. In May 2009, the World Bank provided $25million (USD) to Honduras to rebuild damaged roads and bridges. Workers in Guatemala airlifted food to storm victims due to residual flooding. The Guatemalan government provided $6.6million to residents in the northern portion of the country, including medical supplies and seeds to regrow crops. A state of emergency was declared for Cayo District in Belize. Search and rescue teams were deployed to the district, and medical crews visited several towns, providing help to 3,000people. The Belize National Emergency Management Organization provided meals to about 9,000people following the floods.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} after the storm, the hardest hit {{residents}} faced food shortages and lacked access to clean water, in an area already facing ongoing food shortages. In response, <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Food</b> Programme and other agencies of the United Nations created a program to feed about 350,000people in the region over three months, providing about 5,900tons of food. In the months after the storm, roads were repaired, including the link from Vangaindrano to Midongy. Farmers grew additional beans and potatoes {{to compensate for the}} damaged crops, while the quick distribution of food prevented significant malnutrition. In the subsequent years, about 40% of the forest at Manombo that regrew following Gretelle was of foreign nature, which threatened the original plants in the region.|$|E
