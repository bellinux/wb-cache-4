40|$|Through the {{international}} work carried out recently by International Maritime Organization Marine Environment Protection Committee, {{the need for}} improved selective catalytic reduction systems for marine applications at low and <b>transient</b> <b>temperatures</b> has been acknowledged. It is of importance to improve the low-temperature activity to achieve compliance with the upcoming stricter International Maritime Organization NOX regulation (Tier III, 80 % reduction) for ships. This study therefore investigates the possibilities to improve the low-temperature activity for a commercial vanadium-based urea-selective catalytic reduction catalyst for marine applications. By altering the NO 2 /NOX ratio, the reaction proceeds in the fast selective catalytic reduction reaction regime, which is especially beneficial at low and <b>transient</b> <b>temperatures</b> and in combination with SO 2 and H 2 O. For both steady-state and transient modes, {{it is suggested that}} an improved low-temperature activity for the marine selective catalytic reduction system can be achieved by increasing the NO 2 /NOX ratio to 50 %, whereby utilizing the fast selective catalytic reduction reaction scheme. The fast selective catalytic reduction can significantly improve the NOX reduction already at 250 degrees C in the presence of water or sulfur. The fast selective catalytic reduction will, however, require an increased NO 2 fraction in the exhaust gases, preferably 50 %, which may be achieved by placing an oxidation catalyst upstream of the selective catalytic reduction. The use of an oxidation catalyst upstream of the selective catalytic reduction can offer a possibility to achieve International Maritime Organization Tier III compliance at low and <b>transient</b> <b>temperatures,</b> but to avoid formation of ammonium nitrates and possible ammonium sulfates, temperatures should be kept above 250 degrees C in combination with marine fuels with a maximum of 0. 10 wt% S...|$|E

40|$|Modeling flowing {{wellbore}} fluid <b>transient</b> <b>temperature</b> {{is important}} in many petroleum engineering problems, including, pressure transient testing, flow assurance and wellbore integrity during production, preservation of drilling equipment integrity for geothermal wells and prediction of injection fluid temperatures. In this thesis, development and usage of three models for <b>transient</b> fluid <b>temperature</b> are presented. Two models predict <b>transient</b> <b>temperature</b> of flowing fluid under separate flow configurations and one is for a static fluid column. Additionally, an improvement to an existing <b>transient</b> <b>temperature</b> solution is given. The transient rate model predicts the <b>transient</b> <b>temperature</b> when a flow rate, during production, is changed from some initial value to a new one. This model is particularly useful for pressure transient tests involving multiple disparate constant flow rates where bottomhole pressure has to be calculated from the wellhead pressure. Dependence of fluid density on variable temperature during the test necessitates that effects of unsteady temperature changes {{are taken into account}} for accurate calculation of downhole pressure. The single rate injection model predicts <b>transient</b> <b>temperature</b> of wellbore fluids during injection operations. This model can help in design of acidizing treatments by allowing users to calculate the time required to cool down the well with water pre-flush. This model can also be used for calculation of depth of effectiveness of wax removal treatment, in case of hot oil injection. Very high temperatures during drilling operations can deteriorate mud rheological properties. The conduction model lets the user calculate the time window available for taking corrective actions after an accidental cessation of mud circulation occurs. Method of Laplace transform enabled solution of a temperature distribution equation to create the transient rate model and the injection model. Conduction model was developed by solving the transient heat conduction equation for a multilayer cylinder with mud in annulus and tubing analogous to two layers of the cylinder. All solutions were implemented using conventional spreadsheet software with rudimentary programming...|$|R

The laser induced plasma micro-machining (LIP-MM) is a novel multimaterial and tool-less micro-machining process that also removes material through plasma. Since, both processes remove material through melting and vaporization, machining is always accompanied with heat affected zone. Since different materials have different thermo-physical properties, the plasma discharge energy level for minimal HAZ is material-dependent. The plasma discharge energy level corresponding to minimal HAZ can be experimentally determined by examining the dependence of the spatial distribution of the <b>transient</b> <b>temperature</b> response near the machined zone on the energy level. This paper, for the first time, presents an experimental investigation on real time measurement of the <b>transient</b> <b>temperature</b> response during single discharge machining at different pulse energy levels by the micro-EDM and the LIP-MM processes.

40|$|With the {{installation}} of Permanent Down-hole Gauges (PDGs) during oil field development, a large volume of high resolution pressure, temperature and sometimes flow-rate data are available for real-time and continuous reservoir monitoring. In practice, interpretations of these data can optimize well performance, provide information about the reservoir and continuously calibrate the reservoir model. Although the wellbore is in a non-isothermal environment, heat transfer between the fluid in the wellbore and the formation is often ignored and temperature is usually assumed to be constant {{in the process of}} data interpretation, leading to misunderstanding of the pressure profile. Furthermore, the pressure transient analysis (PTA) often fails to determine accurate flow regimes, and may be erroneously applied in nonlinear reservoir-well systems. These problems motivated my detailed analysis of temperature data. In this thesis, firstly, a non-isothermal wellbore model that is capable of predicting the temperature, pressure, and flow-rate profiles under multi-rate and multiphase production scenarios is established. Then this numerical wellbore model is coupled with a reservoir model to reproduce the <b>transient</b> <b>temperature</b> behaviour at gauge locations. Secondly, a new workflow for integrating transient down-hole data processing is introduced. The relationship between temperature change and flow-rate change is interpreted and a new nonlinearity diagnostic function (1 ̆d 4341 ̆d 4471 ̆d 4621 ̆d 45 f 1 ̆d 450) is presented.
