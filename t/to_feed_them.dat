5|$|Maine Coons require ample {{protein and}} {{nutrients}} in their diets. Since {{they are a}} large cat breed {{with high levels of}} energy, it is best <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>them</b> quality food. Food that lists meat as the first ingredient is best for the Maine Coon.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoan larvae {{either have}} large yolks or {{are capable of}} feeding on plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic algae that help <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>them.</b> Since the parents are immobile, these feeding {{capabilities}} extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and metamorphose into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} {{flying lizard}} has many predators including arboreal snakes and birds. Two species of bird {{that have been}} observed <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> on <b>them</b> include the Indian golden oriole and the black-capped kingfisher. Lion-tailed macaques have been noted <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> on <b>them</b> as well.|$|R

5|$|Young orangutans also beg {{for food}} by such contact and {{accordingly}} their caretakers regurgitate <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>them.</b> Indeed, behaviours of mouth to mouth feeding of premasticated food and ritualized mouth to mouth contact for bonding {{has been observed}} in anthropoid great apes such as gorillas, orangutans, and chimpanzees. All of this supports the idea that human behaviours of kissing and feeding of premastication foods, {{either directly or indirectly}} from the mouth, have their behavioural roots in higher animals and ancestral great apes.|$|E
5|$|Stocks were {{increased}} by animals transferred from other zoos {{that had been}} forced to close. Initially the zoo was given favourable food rationing quotas, but certain foods became unavailable and the price of others increased dramatically. Bananas were impossible to obtain and the supply of fish was problematic. As a result, the keepers were forced to experiment. The sealions became casualties of the food shortage when their keepers attempted <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>them</b> strips of beef soaked in cod liver oil. Although they seemed to thrive on this diet, their digestive systems were unable to cope with the unusual food, and they eventually died of stomach ulcers. The lions' new diet was green-coloured horsemeat, and the monkeys were fed on boiled potatoes. The birds-of-paradise (lack of millet), and the penguins (lack of fish), were unable to adapt to their make-do diet and also succumbed. Vegetables were not in short supply however, as the garden staff grew lettuce, cabbage and carrots in the kitchen gardens.|$|E
5|$|The main {{character}} comes {{equipped with a}} staff after {{the initial stages of}} the game, which functions as both a weapon, and a tool for exploration and puzzle-solving. Combat is mainly melee-orientated, with players locking-on to an enemy upon moving in close. Once in combat, an enemy's health is displayed as a heart icon above them, with players able to strafe and roll around a target to dodge attack, while using the staff to either block incoming strikes, or attack an enemy. As a tool, the staff can be used to open containers, operate mechanisms, or lift up stones to uncover hidden caves and boulders to find items. As the player progress in the story, the staff can be upgraded with powers that can help in combat or assist in solving puzzles and exploring locations, including the ability to fire projectiles at enemies or trigger switches, and a special jump ability to reach places that are inaccessible through normal methods. However, using such powers requires magical energy, which the player can recover by retrieving special crystals from the environment. Along with the staff, the player can also has a sidekick that joins them after a certain stage of the story, who can help by finding them items and using certain abilities to open up new areas. Such abilities, referred to as tricks, require the player <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>them</b> with special mushrooms, with each one constituting one trick that can be performed, with the sidekick able to perform a maximum of six tricks when fully fed before needing more mushrooms. The game's inventory system focuses on three areas - items, staff powers, and tricks - with the player able to use three scanner systems in the game - a mini-map of a region (provided a map has been purchased first), a scanner to give information on objects in that are approached, and a fuel cell radar.|$|E

25|$|One {{example of}} the {{employment}} fallout after the collapse was the experience of small private school in Higashinari Ward of Osaka, which said 400 people applied in October for a single job opening.

25|$|Global wild {{fisheries}} {{are believed}} to have peaked and begun a decline, with valuable habitat such as estuaries in critical condition. The aquaculture or farming of piscivorous fish, like salmon, does not help solve the problem because they need to be fed products from other fish. Studies have shown that salmon farming has major negative impacts on wild salmon, as well as the forage fish that need to be caught <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

25|$|Lycaenids are {{diverse in}} their food habits {{and apart from}} phytophagy, {{some of them are}} {{entomophagous}} feeding on aphids, scale insects, and ant larvae. Some lycaenids even exploit their association with ants by inducing ants <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>them</b> by regurgitation, a process called trophallaxis. Not all lycaenid butterflies need ants, but about 75% of species associate with ants, a relationship called myrmecophily. These associations can be mutualistic, parasitic, or predatory depending on the species.|$|E
25|$|What Scott did not realise is a sledge dog, {{if it is}} to do {{the same}} work as a man, will require the same amount of food. Furthermore, when sledge dogs are given {{insufficient}} food they become difficult to handle. The advantage of the sledge dog is its greater mobility. Not only were the Norwegians accustomed to skiing, which enabled them to keep up with their dogs, but they also understood how <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>them</b> and not overwork them.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} that, with an Indian cotton gin, which is half machine and half tool, {{one man and}} one woman could clean 28 pounds of cotton per day. With a modified Forbes version, one man and a boy could produce 250 pounds per day. If oxen were used to power 16 of these machines, and a few people's labour was used <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>them,</b> they could produce as much work as 750 people did formerly.|$|E

50|$|After hatching, {{and prior}} <b>to</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the fish or {{crustacean}} larvae, brine shrimp nauplii {{should be separated}} from the hatching wastes. After switching off the aeration in the hatching tank, cyst shells will float and nauplii will concentrate {{at the bottom of the}} tank. The nauplii are further concentrated in a concentrator rinse and separated from the cysts.The enrichment process, if needed, generally occurs after the nauplii develop a digestive tract. The three main enrichment approaches are listed below.|$|R

25|$|The years 1640 to 1642 were {{comparatively}} quiet, but in 1643 French Weimar regiments were in occupation, {{along with}} the entire French general staff. The so-called “Weimar occupation” lasted until May 1643, when victory was achieved {{after three days of}} fighting by the Bavarian army under the command of Graf Fugger. In 1645, the town was again plundered by French and Hessian troops. Subsequently, the Bavarians moved back, but provisions were barely enough <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>them.</b> Virtually all that remained were cabbages, beets and new wine.|$|E
25|$|The ample {{residential}} lots of Richland Farms gave residents {{enough space}} {{to raise a}} family, and food <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>them,</b> along with building a barn, and caring for livestock. The farms attracted the black families who had begun migrating from the rural South in the 1950s, and there they found their 'home away from home' in this small community. Compton couldn't support large-scale agricultural business, but it did give the residents {{the opportunity to work}} the land for their families and for the welfare of the new community.|$|E
25|$|A priest named Fr. Sanctulus was {{rebuilding}} {{a church}} of St Lawrence, {{which had been}} attacked and burnt, and hired many workmen to accomplish the job. At one point during the construction, he found himself with nothing <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>them.</b> He prayed to St Lawrence for help, and looking in his basket he found a fresh, white loaf of bread. It seemed to him too small to feed the workmen, but in faith he began to serve it to the men. While he broke the bread, it so multiplied that that his workmen fed from it for ten days.|$|E

25|$|For an {{additional}} two months, the males huddle together for warmth, and incubate their eggs. They endure temperatures approaching , and their {{only source of}} water is snow that falls on the breeding ground. When the chicks hatch, the males have only a small meal <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>them,</b> and if the female does not return, they must abandon their chick {{and return to the}} sea to feed themselves. By the time they return, they have lost half their weight and have not eaten for four months. The chicks are also at risk from predatory birds such as northern giant petrels.|$|E
25|$|Once Jesus, {{the prophet}} Elijah, and St. George {{were going through}} Georgia. When they became tired and hungry they stopped to dine. They saw a Georgian {{shepherd}} and decided to ask him <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>them.</b> First, Elijah {{went up to the}} shepherd and asked him for a sheep. After the shepherd asked his identity Elijah said that, {{he was the one who}} sent him rain to get him a good profit from farming. The shepherd became angry at him and told him that he was the one who also sent thunderstorms, which destroyed the farms of poor widows.

Curtis joined a {{neighborhood}} gang whose main crimes were playing hooky from school and minor pilfering at the local dime store. When Curtis was 11, a friendly neighbor saved him from what he felt would have led to a life of delinquency by sending him to a Boy Scout camp, where he was able to work off his energy and settle down. He attended Seward Park High School. At 16, he had his first small acting part in a school stage play.|$|E
