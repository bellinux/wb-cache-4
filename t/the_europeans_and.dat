5|$|Malcolm Robert Jardine (8 June 1869– 16 January 1947) was an English {{first-class}} cricketer {{who played}} 46 matches, mainly for Oxford University. Although his first-class record was not impressive, he scored 140 in the University Match of 1892 using an unorthodox batting method. He played a few matches for Middlesex but later {{went to work}} in India, in effect ending his English first-class career. He played first-class cricket in India for <b>the</b> <b>Europeans</b> <b>and</b> after a successful legal career, returned to England. His son Douglas went on to play cricket for Oxford, Surrey and England, captaining the latter two and being {{associated with the use of}} Bodyline bowling.|$|E
5|$|On 4 August 1972, Amin {{issued a}} decree {{ordering}} {{the expulsion of}} the 50,000 Asians who were British passport holders. This was later amended to include all 60,000 Asians who were not Ugandan citizens. Around 30,000 Ugandan Asians emigrated to the UK. Others went to Commonwealth countries such as Australia, South Africa, Canada, and Fiji, or to India, Kenya, Pakistan, Sweden, Tanzania, and the United States. Amin expropriated businesses and properties belonging to the Asians and <b>the</b> <b>Europeans</b> <b>and</b> handed them over to his supporters. The businesses were mismanaged, and industries collapsed from lack of maintenance. This proved disastrous for the already declining economy.|$|E

25|$|Political {{instability}} began troubling {{the colony}} and revolts became commonplace.

25|$|Muhammad Ali {{knew that}} he would have to deal with the Mamluks if he wanted to control Egypt. They were still the feudal owners of Egypt and their land was still the source of wealth and power. However, the {{economic}} strain of sustaining the military manpower necessary to defend the Mamluks's system from <b>the</b> <b>Europeans</b> <b>and</b> Turks would eventually weaken them to the point of collapse.|$|E
25|$|Western Europe began {{switching}} from pro-Israel to more pro-Arab policies. This change strained the Western alliance. The US, which imported only 12% {{of its oil}} from the Middle East (compared with 80% for <b>the</b> <b>Europeans</b> <b>and</b> over 90% for Japan), remained staunchly committed to Israel. The percentage of U.S.oil which comes from the nations bordering the Persian Gulf remained steady over the decades, with a figure of {{a little more than}} 10% in 2008.|$|E

The latter's successes gained his people an autonomous enclave for a time on the island. Within {{a few years after}} 1492 the population of Taínos had declined drastically, due to smallpox, measles, and other diseases that arrived with <b>the</b> <b>Europeans,</b> <b>and</b> from other causes discussed below.|$|E

25|$|The {{publication}} {{may vary}} from Pinto's manuscript (some sentences are erased {{and others are}} edited). The disappearance of references to the Society of Jesus, {{one of the most}} active religious orders in the Orient, is notable, as there are clear indications of Pinto's relationship with the society. Pinto's memoirs are just that, his memories of events, giving rise to doubts regarding historical accuracy. However, it documents the impact of the Asian civilizations on <b>the</b> <b>Europeans</b> <b>and</b> is a reasonable analysis of Portuguese action in the Orient (in comparison to Luís de Camões' Os Lusíadas).|$|E
25|$|The {{reality of}} the {{conflicts}} between <b>the</b> <b>Europeans</b> <b>and</b> Xhosa involves a balance of tension. At times, tensions existed between the various Europeans in the Cape region, tensions between Empire administration and colonial governments, and tensions and alliances of the Xhosa tribes. Alliances with Europeans introduced to the Xhosa tribes the use of firearms; even so, the Xhosa lost most of their territory and were incorporated into the British Empire. The Xhosa include some groups that have adopted the Xhosa language and several groups that are now classed as being Xhosa, such as the Mfengu nation, that had an alliance with the Cape Colony.|$|E
25|$|There were {{numerous}} relationships and unions among first, <b>the</b> <b>Europeans</b> <b>and</b> Africans, and later among {{either of those}} groups and persons from Asia. In the Western Cape, a distinctive Cape Coloured and affiliated Cape Malay culture developed. In other parts of Southern Africa, people classified as Coloured were usually the descendants of individuals from two distinct ethnicities. Genetic studies suggest the group has {{the highest levels of}} mixed ancestry in the world. Mitochondrial DNA studies have demonstrated that the maternal (female) lines of the Coloured population are descended mostly from African Khoisan women. This ethnicity shows a gender-biased admixture. Male lines have been African, Asian Indian and Southeast Asian.|$|E

25|$|Before the Jesuits could {{speed up}} the missionary endeavor, the Portuguese came into the Leyte through Mindanao, plundering major {{settlements}} known to be in alliance with the Spaniards. In addition, the Portuguese lootings aroused the anger of the Muslims in Mindanao against <b>the</b> <b>Europeans</b> <b>and</b> the newly baptized Christians in Leyte. As a result, a fleet of seventy caracoas , {{under the command of}} Datu Buwisan, raided Palo, Dulag and the towns of north-eastern Leyte in August 1603. The pirates held the Jesuit, Padre Sebastian Hurtado, as captive. Fortunately, a storm prevented the onslaught from sacking Sogod and Cabalian. Afterwards, in 1632, Padre Ventura Barcena, a Jesuit administering the towns of Sogod, Cabalian and Hinundayan, was captured in Sogod and died in captivity in Tawi-tawi.|$|E
25|$|The Joint Chiefs of Staff had {{determined}} that Rabaul {{was to be}} encircled, with invasions of the Admiralty Islands and Kavieng on the north tip of the island of New Ireland, to begin 1 April at the earliest. Admiral Halsey, anxious to maintain offensive momentum, was unwilling to leave his forces idle until then. To that end, and to provide yet another airfield close to Rabaul, Halsey ordered his amphibious forces to invade the Green Islands, a group of small coral atolls about 115 miles east of Rabaul. Reconnaissance missions determined that the native Melanesians there were well-disposed toward <b>the</b> <b>Europeans,</b> <b>and</b> had been alienated by the Japanese. As a result, Allied planners determined that no preliminary bombing or shelling would be carried out.|$|E
25|$|The slave trade/Middle Passage {{was just}} {{as much a part}} of life in the Atlantic as was the {{merchant}} shipping of goods. Many European powers had ties to the slaving trade by at least the eighteenth century; countries like Portugal, Sweden, Netherlands, France, and England all had outposts on the African coast. Slavers would conduct their business with the larger African tribes who would buy weapons from <b>the</b> <b>Europeans</b> <b>and</b> in turn use them to collect members of other tribes to sell to slave captains. Once in the hands of a slaver, the slave represented a substantial investment as Ian Baucom suggests, by the insuring of slaves purchased. Some European cities such as Liverpool would become successful from operating in this trade system, and would drive the free markets of slavery to handle as much business as was possible.|$|E
