5|$|In the January 1997 State of the Union address, Clinton {{proposed}} a new initiative {{to provide health}} coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy—a Democrat—and Orrin Hatch—a Republican—teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in {{the years of the}} Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. He negotiated the passage of <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> <b>Budget</b> Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth. In 1999 Clinton signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.|$|E

However, Wyden voted against the Bush tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003. He has also voted against <b>the</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> amendment.|$|E

25|$|In an {{alternative}} opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia {{objected to the}} Court's consideration of the case {{with respect to the}} Taxpayer Relief Act, finding no party in the case with standing to challenge it. However, he did find a party with standing to challenge the President's cancellation in <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> <b>Budget</b> Act, and concluded that it did not violate the Constitution, because the Congress has the power to delegate the discretionary authority to decline to spend appropriated sums of money, which he asserted was equivalent to cancellation.|$|E

25|$|He {{voted against}} the death penalty; the flag desecration amendment; <b>the</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> amendment, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act; the Defense of Marriage Act; the Communications Decency Act; and the North American Free Trade Agreement. He was {{critical}} of proposals to replace the progressive income tax with a flat tax. Moynihan surprised many in 1991 when he voted against authorization of the Gulf War. Despite his earlier writings on {{the negative effects of}} the welfare state, he surprised many people again by voting against welfare reform in 1996. He was sharply critical of the bill and certain Democrats who crossed party lines to support it.|$|E
40|$|Virtually {{unknown in}} Canada before <b>the</b> 1990 s, <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> {{legislation}} has suddenly become popular across the country. The author examines the wide diversity of mechanisms {{being used to}} limit state fiscal powers, including spending caps, anti-deficit rules, and tax referenda. Evaluating these measures, the author raises concerns about <b>the</b> impact of <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> laws on economic stability, social justice, and political democracy. She warns against discounting either their instrumental effects or their power to shape public finance discourse. Though some provinces have adopted less severe versions, the author concludes that these efforts only partially mitigate <b>the</b> dangers of <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> laws...|$|R

40|$|A {{cumulative}} error in <b>the</b> water <b>balance</b> <b>budget</b> for Lake Okeechobee produces a one million acre-foot discrepancy in the predicted water volume over a 4 -year period. The {{major source of}} error appears to be complex shoreline marshes that comprise 20 percent of the lake surface. <b>The</b> water <b>balance</b> <b>budget</b> model presently treats these marshes as open water. Using Landsat data, the vegetation in the lake's littoral zone was classified multispectrally to provide a data base for determining water budget information. First, the acreage of a given plant species in the littoral zone was obtained with satellite data. Second, the surface area occupied by plants (which therefore could not be considered open water) was used to adjust the vegetation acreage giving an effective water surface. Based on this information, more detailed representations of evapotranspiration and total water surface (and hence total lake volume) could be provided to <b>the</b> water <b>balance</b> <b>budget</b> computation...|$|R

On the subject of the 1979 energy crisis, Brown decried the [...] "Faustian bargain" [...] that he claimed Carter had entered into with the oil industry, and declared that he would greatly increase federal funding of research into solar power.

2500|$|Since the 1970s, Medicare {{beneficiaries}} {{have had}} the option under Medicare demonstration programs to receive their Medicare benefits through managed capitated-fee health plans, mainly HMOs, {{as an alternative to}} FFS Original Medicare. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Balanced</b> <b>Budget</b> Act of 1997, which formalized the demonstration programs into Part C of Medicare, introduced the term Medicare+Choice as a pseudo-brand for this option and the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 renamed +Choice [...] "Medicare Advantage." [...] These names are government artifacts and {{may or may not be}} visible to the beneficiary. Other managed Medicare plans include COST plans (which are not capitated), dual-eligible (Medicare/Medicaid) plans, and PACE plans (which try to keep seniors that need custodial care in their homes). However 97% of the beneficiaries in Part C are in one of the roughly one dozen types of Medicare Advantage plans (HMO, EGWP, SNP, regional PPO, etc.), primarily in classic vanilla HMOs.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the passage}} of <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> <b>Budget</b> Act of 1997, Medicare {{beneficiaries}} were formally given the option to receive their Original Medicare benefits through capitated health insurance Part C plans, instead of through the Original fee for service Medicare payment system. Many had previously had that option via a series of demonstration projects that dated {{back to the early}} 1980s. These Part C plans were initially known as [...] "Medicare+Choice". As of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, most [...] "Medicare+Choice" [...] plans were re-branded as [...] "Medicare Advantage" [...] (MA) plans (though MA is a government term and might not be visible to the Part C health plan beneficiary). Other plan types, such as 1876 Cost plans, are also available in limited areas of the country. Cost plans are not Medicare Advantage plans and are not capitated. Instead, beneficiaries keep their Original Medicare benefits while their insurance company administers their Part A and Part B benefits. The insurance company is then reimbursed for Part B services by Medicare.|$|E
2500|$|Hurt cosponsored <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> <b>Budget</b> Amendment, {{which did}} not pass the House of Representatives in November 2011. Hurt said of the bill, “By passing a Balanced Budget Amendment, Congress will be {{required}} to spend no more than it takes in, reining in out of control spending once and for all” Hurt also sponsored the Small Business Capital Access and Job Preservation Act that would exempt private equity funds advisers from certain registration and reporting standards. In July, 2011 Hurt sponsored the Market Transparency and Taxpayer Protection Act which would “protect the taxpayers of the United States by requiring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to sell or dispose of the assets of such enterprises that are not critical to their missions.” [...] However, because very little political leverage was used to pass this legislation, it most likely will die in committee. Hurt’s position on Government regulation is clear in his statement that “By reducing the unnecessary government regulations that hinder small businesses, keeping taxes low and allowing people to keep more of what they make, and cutting spending to get our fiscal house in order, the private sector will gain the confidence necessary to expand and create the jobs that the people of the 5th District need and deserve.” ...|$|E
