5|$|There {{used to be}} {{two large}} geysers fields in Nevada—Beowawe and Steamboat Springs—but they were {{destroyed}} by the installation of nearby geothermal power plants. At the plants, geothermal drilling reduced the available heat and lowered the local water <b>table</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point that geyser activity {{could no longer be}} sustained.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium is an {{actinide}} {{which is}} positioned in the periodic <b>table</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left of uranium {{and to the}} right of thorium, and many of its physical properties are intermediate between those two actinides. So, protactinium is more dense and rigid than thorium but is lighter than uranium, and its melting point is lower than that of thorium and higher than that of uranium. The thermal expansion, electrical and thermal conductivities of these three elements are comparable and are typical of post-transition metals. The estimated shear modulus of protactinium {{is similar to that of}} titanium. Protactinium is a metal with silvery-gray luster that is preserved for some time in air. Protactinium easily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and acids, but not with alkalis.|$|E

5|$|The <b>table</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right {{lists the}} {{critical}} masses for curium isotopes for a sphere, without a moderator and reflector. With a metal reflector (30cm of steel), the critical {{masses of the}} odd isotopes are about 3–4kg. When using water (thickness ~20–30cm) as the reflector, the critical mass can be as small as 59gram for 245Cm, 155gram for 243Cm and 1550gram for 247Cm. There is a significant uncertainty in these critical mass values. Whereas it is usually of the order 20%, the values for 242Cm and 246Cm were listed as large as 371kg and 70.1kg, respectively, by some research groups.|$|E
5|$|Jump {{distance}} is measured {{from the edge}} of the <b>table</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> placement of landing by increments of 0.5m. This is done using electronic and video monitoring systems together with event personnel assigned to observe jumps by the side of the hill, known as 'distance measurers'. If enough jumps are deemed to be too far beyond the hill size, or near the 'fall line' as determined by the jury – the zone where the slope begins to flatten out – an immediate meeting is held between the jury and race director, which usually results in the start gate being lowered so as to check inrun speeds and therefore distances. For spectators and judges, increments of 5m are clearly indicated by rows of fir across the hill; a painted red line is used for the K-point, and a dashed red line for the hill size. Both sides of the hill are also marked highly visible in red to indicate the 'landing zone', while the point beyond the hill size is marked in green on the sides.|$|E

5|$|The Han {{court upheld}} a {{socio-economic}} ranking system for commoners and nobles, {{which was based}} on the twenty-ranks system installed by the statesman Shang Yang (d. 338 BCE) of the State of Qin. All males above the age of 15 (excluding slaves) could be promoted in rank up to level eight. When a commoner was promoted in rank, he was granted a more honorable place in the seating arrangements of hamlet banquets, was given a greater portion of hunted game at the table, was punished less severely for certain crimes, and could become exempt from labor service obligations to the state. This system favored the elderly, since a longer lifespan meant more opportunities to become promoted. In addition to an increase in salary (see <b>table</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right), newly promoted men were granted wine and ox-meat for a celebratory banquet. The 19th and 20th ranks were both marquess ranks, yet only a 20th rank allowed one to have a marquessate fief.|$|E

25|$|The binding affinities of {{iprindole}} {{for various}} biological targets {{are presented in}} the <b>table</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right. It is presumed {{to act as an}} inhibitor or antagonist/inverse agonist of all sites. Considering the range of its therapeutic concentrations (e.g., 63–271nM at 90mg/day), only the actions of iprindole on the 5-HT2 and histamine receptors might be anticipated to be of possible clinical significance. However, it is unknown whether these actions are in fact responsible for the antidepressant effects of iprindole. The plasma protein binding of iprindole and hence its free percentage and potentially bioactive concentrations {{do not seem to be}} known.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of partial agonism of the high-affinity state of the D2 receptor (and indirect/downstream activation of AMPA receptors), all of these actions are far weaker than ketamine's antagonism of the NMDA receptor (see <b>table</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right; minimum of more than 10-fold selectivity for the NMDA receptor relative to the site with the next highest affinity). A binding study assessed ketamine at 56sites including neurotransmitter receptors and transporters and found that ketamine had Ki values of >10,000nM at all sites except the dizocilpine site of the NMDA receptor (Ki = 659nM), indicating a minimum of 15-fold selectivity for the NMDA receptor over any other site.|$|E
