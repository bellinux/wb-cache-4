40|$|The Euro Area {{remains a}} {{well-known}} monetary union in the World. But {{the possibilities of}} creation of new monetary unions are discussed. It is spoken about NAFTA (Canada, Mexico and the United States) or MERCOSUR (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela). The aim {{of this paper is}} to assess the similarity of demand and supply shocks in <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> NAFTA and MERCOSUR, and to compare it with <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Euro Area. For these aims, correlation and structural vector autoregression methods are used. Methods are based on Blanchard and Quah (1989) and Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1993). We confirm the existence of core states and periphery states in the Euro Area with some exceptions. If we compare supply and demand shocks, we find more similarity in the case of supply shocks in <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Euro Area. According to <b>the</b> results, <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> NAFTA are more appropriate for the creation of monetary union than <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> MERCOSUR. <b>The</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> NAFTA achieve high correlation coefficients of supply and demand shocks (except Mexico for supply shocks) ...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) {{have set}} on course {{processes}} {{to become a}} currency union. Among other conditions, the optimal currency theory proposes high trade integrations between <b>the</b> candidate <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> a currency union because it facilitates the synchronization of the business cycles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> which is needed for an effective currency union. To assess the levels of trade integrations between <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WAMZ, this study constructs an export frontier for each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WAMZ using each country’s aggregated export data for at least 45 <b>countries</b> over <b>the</b> period 2000 - 2014.

The trade efficiency estimates between <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WAMZ indicate various degrees of trade integrations.

5|$|Contacts {{between the}} Ethiopian Empire and Imperial China {{seem to have}} been very limited, if not mostly indirect. There were some {{attempts}} in Chinese historiographic and encyclopedic literature to describe parts of Ethiopia or outside areas that it once controlled. Zhang Xiang, a scholar of Africa–China relations, asserts that <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> Dou le described in the Xiyu juan (i.e. Western Regions) chapter of the Book of Later Han was that of the Aksumite port city of Adulis. It was from this city that an envoy was sent to Luoyang, the capital of China's Han dynasty, in roughly 100 AD. The 11th-century New Book of Tang and 14th-century Wenxian Tongkao describe <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> Nubia (previously controlled by the Aksumite Kingdom) as a land of deserts south of the Byzantine Empire that was infested with malaria, where the natives of the local Mo-lin territory had black skin and consumed foods such as Persian dates. In his English translation of this document, Friedrich Hirth identified Mo-lin (Molin) with the kingdom of 'Alwa (Upper Kush) and neighboring Lao-p'o-sa with the kingdom of Maqurra (Lower Kush), both in Nubia.|$|E

The Bengali-speaking people of East Pakistan strongly opposed this policy, and later in 1971 the official language issue {{was a factor in}} the region's secession to form <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> Bangladesh.|$|E
