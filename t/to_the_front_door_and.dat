500|$|Allenville Mill Storehouse (also {{known as}} Company Storehouse or Allenville) is a {{historic}} mill storehouse at 5 Esmond Street in Esmond, Rhode Island within the town of Smithfield, Rhode Island. The exact date of construction is unknown, but it was built with rubble-construction as was typical of mill construction {{during and after the}} War of 1812. In 1813, Phillip Allen purchased 4.5 acres of land and constructed a mill on the site, but the first specific record to refer to the storehouse was an insurance policy from 1836. Allen sold the property in 1857 and it changed ownership several times before it became Esmond Mills in 1906. In 1937, the building was used as a post office and described erroneously as the [...] "Old Allenville Mill". The building has had some alterations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> possibly the addition of a side door, but the interior of the structure was not detailed in the National Register of Historic Places nomination. The Allenville Mill Storehouse was added to National Register of Historic Places in 1972.|$|E
2500|$|Later in life, while {{performing}} as a stand-up comedian in Las Vegas, Benny {{had just begun}} to tell an old joke about the salesman, the farmer, and the farmer's daughter: [...] "So the salesman and the farmer's daughter come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> the farmer opens the door." [...] At this point, Sammy Davis, Jr. walks onstage behind Jack, the audience screams, and Davis proceeds to speak and sing and dance for about 25 minutes while Benny continues to stand at center stage, quietly watching the spectacle. When Davis finally walks offstage and the audience's applause dies down, Benny continues to watch Davis offstage for a few moments, then, as the audience is finally quiet, continues: [...] "... So the farmer saidâ€”" [...] And that's as far as that joke got, because the audience laughed for minutes afterward.|$|E
