In {{response to the}} reformation of The Hart Foundation (this time as an anti-American stable) <b>The</b> <b>Patriot</b> debuted on <b>the</b> July 14 edition of Raw Is War to stand up against Hart and defend America. <b>The</b> <b>Patriot</b> pulled off a surprise win against Bret Hart on the July 28 episode of Raw in a match which Shawn Michaels distracted Hart from ringside while doing guest commentary. On the following Raw Is War, Sgt.
