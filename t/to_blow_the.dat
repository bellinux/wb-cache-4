5|$|Over the {{remaining}} {{months of the}} year the division carried out patrols of the rail and road networks, which were being mined. Some of the mines killed men from the division attempting to disarm them, until orders were issued <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> mines up rather than disarm them. Then on 2December a road mine killed four men from the 2nd Forward Observation Unit (Airborne).|$|E
5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues <b>to</b> <b>blow.</b> <b>The</b> distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E
5|$|Ambitious {{reporter}} Amy Harkin (Nancy McKeon) {{is stuck}} {{reporting on the}} heat wave while trying to find proof behind the scenes that Lexer and Midwest {{are responsible for the}} lack of sufficient power. The Secretary of Energy, Shirley Abbott (Dianne Wiest), is actively warning various politicians and the president that the power grid is too outdated to handle real natural disasters and that it is too vulnerable to attack. Dan London (Ari Cohen), the chief engineer of Lexer, has also repeatedly warned Lexer that their systems are too vulnerable to hackers, but the company is only interested in going with the cheapest options. He decides <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle on the company to Harkin, but as he refuses to appear on camera, Harkin's boss will not allow the piece to air.|$|E

5|$|As Gotō's ships {{endeavored}} to escape, Scott's ships tightened their formation {{and then turned}} to pursue the retreating Japanese warships. At 00:06, two torpedoes from Kinugasa barely missed Boise. Boise and Salt Lake City turned on their searchlights to help target the Japanese ships, giving Kinugasas gunners clear targets. At 00:10, two shells from Kinugasa exploded in Boises main ammunition magazine between turrets one and two. The resulting explosion killed almost 100 men and threatened <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> ship apart. Seawater rushed in through rents in her hull opened by the explosion and helped quench the fire before it could explode the ship's powder magazines. Boise immediately sheered out of the column and retreated from the action. Kinugasa and Salt Lake City exchanged fire with each other, each hitting the other several times, causing minor damage to Kinugasa and damaging one of Salt Lake Citys boilers, reducing her speed.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division {{arrive with}} {{infantry}} and armor.

Miller attempts <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> bridge, but is shot and mortally wounded by Steamboat Willie, who has rejoined the Germans. Just before a Tiger tank reaches the bridge, an American P-51 Mustang flies overhead and destroys the tank, followed by American armored units which rout the remaining Germans. Witnessing Miller's shooting, Upham confronts Steamboat Willie and his group {{as they attempt to}} retreat. Steamboat Willie raises his hands in surrender, believing that Upham will accept because of their earlier encounter. Instead, Upham kills him, but lets the other Germans flee.|$|E
5|$|North American had {{originally}} suggested the hatch open outward and use explosive bolts <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> hatch {{in case of}} emergency, as had been done in Project Mercury. NASA did not agree, arguing the hatch could accidentally open, as it had on Grissom's Liberty Bell 7 flight, so the Manned Spacecraft Center designers rejected the explosive design {{in favor of a}} mechanically operated one for the Gemini and Apollo programs. Before the fire, the Apollo astronauts had recommended changing the design to an outward-opening hatch, and this was already slated for inclusion in the Block II Command Module design. According to Donald K. Slayton's testimony before the House investigation of the accident, this was based on ease of exit for spacewalks {{and at the end of}} flight, rather than for emergency exit.|$|E

Schiavo appeared on ABC's Nightline program the night after the crash and was highly critical of FAA safety inspections methods. After resigning her position as Inspector General Schiavo taught courses at Ohio State University, and in April 1997 she joined the staff of Ohio State University in the position of Enarson Executive-in-Residence.|$|E
5|$|The {{town was}} well defended and fortified, as Navarro had {{prepared}} a {{defense in depth}} with several concentric rings of trenches, barricades and fortifications. However, unknown to the defenders, the insurrectionists had with them significant supplies of dynamite and foreign experts from other guerrilla wars, including Boer Gen. Ben Viljoen and the grandson of the famous Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi II (news dispatches from the battle also mention {{the participation of the}} future star of many Hollywood Westerns, Tom Mix). In order to counteract the formidable defenses, the rebels developed an effective strategy that managed to circumvent Navarro's well-placed machine-gun nests and street barricades. Rather than attacking through the streets, the rebels used the dynamite <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> walls of the adobe houses that were huddled up next to each other, which allowed them to proceed through the city house by house.|$|E
5|$|While at {{the funeral}} for Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez) and Libby, a boat comes into view out at sea. Jack, Sayid, and Sawyer swim out to it and climb onto the boat.

The next day, after Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) prevents Locke from destroying the computer that controls the timer, Locke enlists Desmond's help in letting the timer run down to zero. Desmond hotwires the blast doors shut, locking Eko outside the computer room and Desmond and Locke inside of it. Eko, distraught, seeks Charlie Pace's (Dominic Monaghan) help. The two attempt to use dynamite <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> blast door open, but the blast doors are unscathed, while they are both injured.|$|E

5|$|With half-time fast approaching, Barcelona's {{confidence}} {{began to}} show: first, Messi attempted to flick a {{pass over the}} top of the United defence to Thierry Henry, which Rio Ferdinand intercepted; Iniesta then tried an ambitious back-heel that Van der Sar collected; and finally Messi sped through three Manchester United defenders towards the by-line, only for his cut-back cross to be pounced upon by Van der Sar and then cleared by Vidić. On the stroke of half-time, Iniesta himself then attempted to flick the ball through to Henry, but it was just too high for the French striker, and referee Massimo Busacca took that cue <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle for the interval.|$|E
5|$|A snow sweeper uses brushes {{to remove}} thin layers of snow from the {{pavement}} surface. Snow sweepers are used after plowing {{to remove any}} remaining material missed by the larger vehicles in areas with very low snow-tolerance, such as airport runways and racing tracks, as the flexible brushes follow the terrain better than the rigid blades of snowplows and snow blowers. These brushes also allow the vehicle to be used on the tactile tiles found at traffic lights and tram stops, without damaging the delicate surface. Unlike other winter service vehicles, snow sweepers do not compress the snow, leaving a rough, high friction, surface behind them. This makes snow sweepers the most efficient method of snow removal for snow depths below 10centimetres (4in). Snow deeper than this however can clog the brushes, and most snow sweepers cannot be used to clear snow deeper than 15centimetres (6in). A more advanced version of the snow sweeper is the jet sweeper, which adds an air-blower just behind the brushes, in order <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> swept snow clear of the pavement and prevent the loosened snow from settling.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} in the United States, Charlie learns that Steve has resurfaced under a new {{identity}} and is laundering the gold through a Ukrainian jeweler named Yevhen to finance his lavish lifestyle in Los Angeles. Charlie gathers the team, and also recruits John's daughter Stella, a skilled private safe cracker, offering her {{the chance to get}} revenge on Steve for her father's death. They stake out Steve's mansion, and Stella, disguising herself as a cable technician, is able to map out its interior, allowing them to determine the location of Steve's safe containing the bullion. Coincidentally, Steve, unaware of Stella's identity, offers {{to go out on a}} date with her. Charlie devises a plan using explosives <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> safe while Stella is on the date with Steve, using three heavily modified Mini Coopers to transport the gold out of the mansion. Charlie enlists the help of Skinny Pete for the explosives and Wrench to make the modifications on the cars. However, on the night of the planned heist, they find Steve's neighbors are having a party, and the explosives would draw their attention, and they abandon the plan. Stella inadvertently gives away her identity to Steve by using similar phrases her father used, but the team arrives to help protect her. Steve is shocked they survived but taunts them that he has the upper hand.|$|E

5|$|The Phillies {{opened their}} {{season with a}} three-game series in Arlington, Texas against the Rangers. On opening day, {{although}} they took a 6–0 lead (thanks {{in part to a}} grand slam by Jimmy Rollins, his 200th career home run), but Cliff Lee gave up seven runs in the next two innings. The Phillies tied the game in the fourth inning, and over the next several innings Marlon Byrd and Cody Asche homered. Texas scored two more runs, but the Phillies won 14–10. Despite the 14 opening-day runs, Ryne Sandberg changed the lineup for the Phillies' second game (against left-handed Martin Perez) by replacing three left-handed hitters with right-handed hitters (perhaps to maximize the Phillies' platoon advantage). A. J. Burnett started, pitching six innings and giving up one run. The game was scoreless until the sixth inning before the Rangers won, 3–2, on a walk-off single by Adrián Beltré {{in the bottom of the}} ninth. Although Kyle Kendrick allowed one run in seven innings in the series' final game, Jonathan Papelbon gave up three runs in the ninth inning (including a walk-off walk to Shin-Soo Choo) <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> save. The Phillies lost two of their first three games, despite strong starting pitching in the last two.|$|E
5|$|A large robotic craft arrives {{searching for}} Finn. When Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) finally {{encounters}} it, Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) destroys {{it with his}} fist. Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) examines the wreckage and discovers its location of origin; this engenders in Finn a desire to discover the craft's creators. Finn thus resolves to travel across the sea from whence the craft came, but before leaving, he tells Fern (voiced by Hayden Ezzy) to stay and look after Ooo for him. Princess Bubblegum, Marceline (voiced by Olivia Olson) and Fern see Finn, Jake and Susan Strong (voiced by Jackie Buscarino) off on their voyage. Initially, the journey is easy and uneventful, but soon, Finn, Jake, and Susan encounter a sea dragon named Whipple (voiced by Josh Fadem), who {{turns out to be}} rather annoying. BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), who unbeknownst to the others was stowing away on their boat, angrily tells Whipple off, which causes the sea dragon to summon a storm and destroys their boat. This predicament forces Jake to use his magical powers and take on the shape of a boat for the rest to ride. Unfortunately, {{below the surface of the}} water, a species of jellyfish latches onto him, which causes Jake to begin hallucinating. Eventually, after much struggle, Finn and Susan are able to remove them, which causes the hallucinations to end. At this point, Jake complains about wanting to return home, but Finn reveals how important this trip is to him. Whipple overhears Finn's lament and begins to feel sorry for his actions; he then uses his powers <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> group over the dangerous waters.|$|E
