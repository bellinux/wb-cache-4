2500|$|The {{constructive}} trusts {{that are}} usually seen as responding to consent (for instance, like a commercial contract), or [...] "intention" [...] are, first, agreements to convey property where all the formalities {{have not yet been}} completed. Under the doctrine of anticipation, if an agreement could be specifically enforced, before formalities are completed the agreement to <b>transfer</b> <b>a</b> <b>property</b> is regarded as effective in equity, and the property will be held on trust (unless this is expressly excluded by the agreement's terms). Second, when someone agrees to use property for another's benefit, or divide a property after purchase, but then goes back on the agreement, the courts will impose a constructive trust. In Binions v Evans when Mr and Mrs Binions bought a large property they promised the sellers that Mrs Evans could remain for life in her cottage. They subsequently tried to evict Mrs Evans, but Lord Denning MR held that their agreement had created a constructive trust, and so the property was not theirs to deal with. Third, gifts or trusts that are made without completing all formalities will be enforced under a constructive trust if {{it is clear that the}} person making the gift or trust manifested a true intention to do so. In the leading case, Pennington v Waine a lady named Ada Crampton had wished to transfer 400 shares to her nephew, Harold, had filled in a share transfer form and given it to Mr Pennington, the company's auditors, and had died before Mr Pennington had registered it. Ada's other family members claimed the shares still belonged to them, but the Court of Appeal held that even though not formally complete, the estate held the shares on constructive trust for Harold. Similarly, in T Choithram International SA v Pagarani the Privy Council held that Mr Pagarani's estate held money on constructive trust after he died for a new foundation, even though Mr Pagarani had not completed the trust deeds, because he had publicly announced his intention to hold the money on trust. Fourth, if a person who is about to die secretly declares that he wishes property to go to someone not named in a will, the executor holds that property on constructive trust. Similarly, fifth, if a person writes a [...] "mutual will" [...] with their partner, agreeing that their property will go to a particular beneficiary when they both die, the surviving person cannot simply change their mind and will hold the property on constructive trust for the party who was agreed.|$|E

50|$|A {{trust is}} a {{particular}} juridical instrument by which a settler (disponente) can <b>transfer</b> <b>a</b> <b>property</b> (movable or immovable property) to a “trustee” who has to exercise and manage this right for a “beneficiary” (to whom the full property will be transferred with the termination of the trust) who has the “equitable right”. In civil law systems the beneficiary’s right is not a “diritto reale” but a “personal right” towards the “trustee”.If it is not foreseen by the constitutive contract, the property assets cannot be alienated by neither by the trustee nor by the beneficiary. Trust property cannot be foreclosed by the personal creditors of the trustee, the beneficiary or their heirs.|$|E

5000|$|The {{types of}} deeds {{that are now}} used to {{transfer}} real property are a relatively modern invention. Previously, the grantor transferred the property to the buyer, called the [...] "grantee", by performing some commonly recognized deed, such as picking {{up a handful of}} soil of the property to be transferred, handing it to the buyer, and reciting legally prescribed words that acknowledged the transfer in the presence of witnesses. This was called livery of seisin. Over time, and particularly with the development of modern technology that permits government offices to keep accurate copies of documents, the physical deed that was formerly performed in order to <b>transfer</b> <b>a</b> <b>property</b> was replaced by the paper deed, also known as a deed poll, that is now commonly used.|$|E

40|$|Calabresi and Melamed {{delivered}} a powerful theory to explain {{under what conditions}} it is economically efficient to <b>transfer</b> <b>a</b> <b>property</b> right by voluntary and alternatively by involuntary transactions. In the first instance, the property right should be protected by a property rule or an injunction {{as well as by}} criminal law sanctions in order to prevent involuntary transactions altogether. In the second instance, it should be protected only by a liability rule that provides compensation for involuntary transactions. Their theory is normative {{in the sense that they}} defend involuntary transactions under one set of conditions and voluntary transactions under another. However, their analysis is also analytical insofar as it predicts an evolutionary pressure on legal norms to encourage voluntary or involuntary transactions if the conditions, which they identified, are met. This article describes two diametrically opposed legal changes in Germany. In nuisance law, the development was from voluntary to involuntary transactions, while in privacy law it was from involuntary to voluntary transactions. We try to make it clear that these developments were triggered by the underlying causes that Calabresi and Melamed identified in their seminal paper on property rules vs. liability rules...|$|E
40|$|A recent {{analysis}} of the lipophilicity profile of cetirizine in the octanol/water and dodecane/water systems revealed a partial intramolecular charge neutralization that can partly explain why cetirizine has pharmacokinetic properties differing from those of first-generation antihistamines such as hydroxyzine. As conformational changes are the principal driving force for this intramolecular effect, the present study deals with the partitioning of cetirizine and hydroxyzine in an apolar medium well-suited to reveal intramolecular interactions, namely the 1, 2 -dichloroethane/water system. The lipophilicity of the different electrical forms of cetirizine and hydroxyzine was studied by two-phase titrimetry and cyclic voltammetry. The differences in lipophilicity between the dicationic, monocationic, zwitteronic, and anionic species of cetirizine indicated intramolecular interactions via folded conformations, which render the molecule markedly more lipophilic than expected at physiological pH. Folded conformations were also found to predominate in monocationic and neutral hydroxyzine. The ionic partition diagram of cetirizine indicates that it acts as a proton transporter across interfaces under certain conditions of pH and Galvani potential difference. This study underlines the importance of conformational effects on the partition properties of cetirizine and hydroxyzine, {{as well as the}} complexity of its interfacial mechanisms of transfer. In particular, cetirizine can facilitate proton <b>transfer,</b> <b>a</b> <b>property</b> of potential biological relevanc...|$|E
40|$|Multiheme cytochromes {{have been}} implicated in Geobacter sulfurreducens (Gs) {{extracellular}} electron transfer (EET). These proteins are potential targets to improve EET and enhance bioremediation and electrical current production by Gs. However, the functional characterization of multiheme cytochromes is particularly complex due to the co-existence of several microstates in solution, connecting the fully reduced and fully oxidized states. Over the last decade, new strategies {{have been developed to}} characterize multiheme redox proteins functionally and structurally. These strategies were used to reveal the functional mechanism of Gs multiheme cytochromes and also to identify key residues in these proteins for EET. In previous studies, we set the foundations for enhancement of the EET abilities of Gs by characterizing a family of five triheme cytochromes (PpcA-E). These periplasmic cytochromes are implicated in electron transfer between the oxidative reactions of metabolism in the cytoplasm and the reduction of extracellular terminal electron acceptors at the cell’s outer surface. The results obtained suggested that PpcA can couple e-/H+ <b>transfer,</b> <b>a</b> <b>property</b> that might contribute to the proton electrochemical gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane for metabolic energy production. The structural and functional properties of PpcA were characterized in detail and used for rational design of a family of 23 single site PpcA mutants. In this review, we summarize the functional characterization of the native and mutant proteins. Mutants that retain the mechanistic features of PpcA and adopt preferential e-/H+ transfer pathways at lower reduction potential values compared to the wild-type protein were selected for in vivo studies as the best candidates to increase the electron transfer rate of Gs. For the first time Gs strains have been manipulated by the introduction of mutant forms of essential proteins with the aim to develop and improve bioelectrochemical technologies...|$|E
40|$|People often {{interpret}} novel noun-noun combinations by <b>transferring</b> <b>a</b> <b>property</b> {{from one}} constituent {{concept of the}} combination to the other. Two theories make different predictions about these `property' interpretations. Dual-process theory predicts that properties transferred will be alignable differences of the concepts being combined. Constraint theory predicts that properties transferred will be diagnostic properties of the concepts they originate in. An experimental study tested these contrasting predictions in interpretation comprehension and interpretation production tasks. The results showed that participants reliably preferred diagnostic property interpretations, whether alignable or non-alignable, in both tasks. There was no reliable preference for alignable interpretations in either task. This confirms constraint theory's predictions about property interpretations, and goes against the predictions of dual-process theory...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIs mapping a {{necessary}} condition for analogical transfer ? According to classical models of reasoning by analogy (SME, AcME, SIAM, IAM), analogical transfer requires that subjects make first of all complete one-to-one correspondences between base and target elements. It is only when the mapping is finished that subjects may project inferences from the base to the target. Consequently, these models predict that a cross-mapping between base and target (same base-target elements which play different roles) should increase the time necessary for <b>transfering</b> <b>a</b> <b>property</b> from the base to the target: Empirical results obtained here are inconsistent with this prediction because, in a series of experiments, we show that the increase in time to match two cross-mapping objects does not involve an increase in time to process the target.
