The tested specimen can be attached using <b>clamps</b> or <b>hooks.</b> <b>The</b> number and <b>the</b> size of <b>clamps</b> and <b>hooks</b> {{have a significant}} impact on the distribution of stress and strain in the centre of the specimen, where deformation is measured. Using the developed computational model, a sensitivity analysis of number and size of <b>clamps</b> and <b>hooks</b> and a sensitivity analysis of placement of <b>clamps</b> was elaborated. <b>The</b> number and size of <b>clamps</b> and <b>hooks</b> were optimized in such a way that the material’s parameters obtained by the tension test correspond to the utmost to the actual parameters of the material.

40|$|AbstractReplication {{machines}} use ring-shaped clamps that encircle DNA {{to tether}} the polymerase to <b>the</b> chromosome. <b>The</b> <b>clamp</b> is assembled on DNA by a clamp loader.

40|$|<b>The</b> sliding <b>clamps</b> of {{chromosomal}} replicases are {{acted upon}} by both <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> loader and DNA polymerase. Several other proteins and polymerases also interact with <b>the</b> <b>clamp.</b> These proteins bind <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> at <b>the</b> same spot {{and use it}} in sequential fashion.

This paper describes how different proteins in the Escherichia coli replicase, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, coordinate their traffic flow on <b>the</b> <b>clamp.</b> <b>The</b> mechanism by which traffic flow on <b>the</b> beta <b>clamp</b> is directed is based on competition of the proteins for <b>the</b> <b>clamp,</b> where DNA structure modulates the competition.

5000|$|<b>The</b> clover <b>clamp,</b> also {{referred}} to as a [...] "butterfly clamp", is of Japanese design and provides increasing tension if pulled. <b>The</b> <b>clamp</b> itself is flat, about 5 cm by 10 cm (2 by 4 in) in size. <b>The</b> <b>clamp</b> is applied to the nipple and the spring tension holds <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> in place. <b>The</b> <b>clamp</b> usually provides a very high pain level, and is usually only used by more advanced users. To increase tension on the nipples, small weights such as fishing line sinkers can be attached to the ends of <b>the</b> <b>clamp.</b> As increased pulling tension is applied to <b>the</b> <b>clamp,</b> it will cause the jaws of <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> to close tighter, depending on the amount of pull pressure. Another method is to use <b>the</b> <b>clamps</b> to keep a person in one place. If cord is tied from <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> to a fixed place, the wearer of <b>the</b> <b>clamps</b> cannot move away because <b>the</b> <b>clamps</b> will tighten as they move.

5000|$|Sliding clamps {{are loaded}} onto their {{associated}} DNA template strands by specialized proteins known as [...] "sliding clamp loaders", which also disassemble <b>the</b> <b>clamps</b> after replication has completed.

40|$|Chromosomal {{replication}} is {{an essential}} process in all life. This dissertation highlights regulatory roles for two critical protein complexes {{at the heart of}} the replication fork: 1) <b>the</b> sliding <b>clamp,</b> <b>the</b> major polymerase processivity factor, and 2) <b>the</b> sliding <b>clamp</b> loader, a spiral-shaped AAA+ ATPase, which loads <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> onto DNA. <b>The</b> <b>clamp</b> is a promiscuous binding protein that interacts with at least 100 binding partners to orchestrate many processes on DNA, but spatiotemporal regulation of these binding interactions is unknown. Remarkably, a recent disease-causing mutant of <b>the</b> sliding <b>clamp</b> showed specific defects in DNA repair pathways. We aimed to use this mutant as a tool to understand the binding specificity of clamp interactions, and investigate the disease further. We solved three structures of the mutant, and biochemically showed perturbation of partnerbinding for some, but not all, ligands. Using a fission yeast model, we showed that mutant cells are sensitive to select DNA damaging agents. These data revealed significant flexibility within the binding site, which likely regulates partner binding. Before <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> can act on DNA, <b>the</b> sliding <b>clamp</b> loader places <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> onto DNA at primer/template (p/t) junctions. <b>The</b> <b>clamp</b> loader reaction couples p/t binding and subsequent ATP hydrolysis to clamp closure.

50|$|DNA polymerase’s {{ability to}} slide along the DNA {{template}} allows increased processivity. There {{is a dramatic}} increase in processivity at the replication fork.

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PROJECT CONTEXT ESCO Incorporated {{manufactures}} {{a variety}} of steel parts using a sand mold casting process. In this process a clamping device is used to prevent the sand mold from leaking during the pouring process. <b>The</b> current <b>clamp</b> design has several deficiencies including an uneven distribution of <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> force, mold damage caused by the engagement of <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> device, and <b>the</b> manual disengagement of <b>the</b> <b>clamp.</b> These factors result in defective parts and time delays in part manufacturing. The MIME capstone design team 46. 1 was tasked with creating an improved clamping device that would eliminate these issues and increase profits for ESCO. DESIGN PROCESS The team began the design process by analyzing the customer needs and developing corresponding engineering requirements. The second {{step in the process}} consisted of researching {{a variety of}} clamping designs and design components used both within and outside of the casting industry and evaluating them according to how well they satisfied the required functions. Based on this information the team created four different <b>clamp</b> designs. <b>The</b> four designs were then evaluated against the engineering requirements and ranked in a decision matrix. The concept with the highest ranking was selected as the final design. SELECTED DESIGN <b>The</b> <b>clamp</b> design selected for implementation, shown in Figure 1, is based on two main components: a rack and pinion jack and an adjustable steel footprint. The rack and pinion jack reduces set-up time by combining <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> height adjustment and clamping force application with handle rotation. The force is applied smoothly, thus avoiding damage to the mold. The adjustable footprint uses steel angle irons that can withstand the high temperatures of the casting process and a slotted connection to accommodate a variety of mold layouts. It also distributes <b>the</b> required <b>clamping</b> force evenly. Finally, the design utilizes two pinned connections that allow <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> device to disengage automatically from the sand mold. IMPLEMENTATION AND TESTING The team purchased the Rack and Pinion jack from a company in Germany and purchased the remaining parts from local hardware stores. Next, the team performed all of the welding and fabrication for each of the components of <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> at Oregon State University. <b>The</b> <b>clamp</b> was then assembled and tested on a simulated sand mold. Load cells were used to demonstrate the ability of <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> to provide <b>the</b> necessary <b>clamping</b> force as well as the force distribution. Additional tests on <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> were performed including: durability, setup time, maintenance, sand mold clearance, and the ability of <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> to auto disengage. RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS <b>The</b> <b>clamp</b> design passed all of the tests. Based on the implementation and testing, modifications were made to improve the functionality of <b>the</b> <b>clamp.</b> First, <b>the</b> team replaced the plastic handle on the jack with an aluminum handle for increased durability. Second, the team added a sheet metal guard around the bottom portion of the rack to prevent damage due to liquid metal splashing onto the rack. In the future, the team recommends replacing the manually operated handle with an attachment that allows for a pneumatic drill to reduce setup time. Additionally, the team recommends adding a torque wrench attachment to the handle to provide a more consistent clamping force each time <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> is engaged...|$|R

40|$|High-speed DNA {{replication}} is {{an intricate}} process {{that requires the}} coordinated efforts of many proteins at the replication fork. The replicative DNA polymerases require tethering to the DNA substrate {{in order to remain}} bound to the template and replicate the DNA processively. The polymerases are tethered to DNA by attachment to ring-shaped processivity factors, known as sliding clamps, which encircle DNA. Pentameric molecular machines comprised of AAA+ subunits, known as clamp loaders, are required to link <b>the</b> sliding <b>clamps</b> to DNA topologically. <b>Clamp</b> loaders, through <b>the</b> binding and hydrolysis of ATP, catalyze the opening of <b>the</b> ring-shaped sliding <b>clamps</b> and <b>the</b> placement of <b>the</b> <b>clamps</b> around DNA. Interaction with a sliding <b>clamp</b> requires that <b>the</b> subunits of a clamp loader be loaded with ATP. Once bound to <b>the</b> <b>clamp,</b> <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> loader complex binds to a primer-template junction, in the process threading the DNA through the open interface of <b>the</b> <b>clamp.</b> Binding to <b>the</b> primer-template junction induces a conformational change in <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> loader that acts as a switch, activating the ATPase activity of the AAA+ subunits and resulting in release of <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> and DNA by <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> loader. <b>The</b> structural mechanisms by which clamp loaders recognize primer-template junctions and hydrolyze ATP in response to DNA binding are not well understood. In this dissertation, I report the crystal structure of <b>the</b> E. coli <b>clamp</b> loader, &# 947; complex, bound to primer-template DNA. The structure reveals that, when bound to DNA, the AAA+ domains of <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> loader subunits adopt a highly symmetric spiral conformation that interacts with the helical DNA duplex, with the N-terminal domains of the subunits tracking the template strand of the primer-template junction. In this conformation, the ATP binding sites, which are formed at subunit-subunit interfaces within the AAA+ spiral, are all in the same ATPase activated conformation, suggesting a mechanism by which DNA binding promotes this conformation and thereby leads to ATP hydrolysis. An unexpected feature of this structure is that primer-template recognition is restricted primarily to the template strand, with virtually no contacts made with the primer strand. As a consequence of this mode of DNA binding in which contacts are restricted to the template strand, models for the recognition of RNA-DNA primer-template junctions, as well as the recognition of reverse polarity primer-templates, are proposed. A related structure which I also present, that of <b>the</b> E. coli <b>clamp</b> loader bound to DNA as well as a peptide derived from the N-terminal tail of the &# 968; protein, a clamp loader binding partner, suggests a mechanism whereby the binding of the &# 968; protein promotes <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> and DNA binding activities of <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> loader. Binding of this peptide promotes a conformational change within the collar domains of <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> loader that is necessary for <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> loader to adopt the highly symmetric spiral conformation of the AAA+ domains when bound to DNA...|$|R
