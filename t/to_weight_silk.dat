40|$|Nutritive {{parameters}} {{have been}} studied in the silkworm, Bombyx mori by topical application of linoleic acid on a leaf diet. Linoleic acid supplement caused a decrease in ingestion, digestion and consumption indices {{and an increase in}} ECI, BCD and growth rates. Larval weight, cocoon <b>weight,</b> shell <b>weight,</b> <b>silk</b> gland- somatic index, fecundity and hatching percentage improved significantly despite lower consumption levels of linoleic acid enriched leaf. Greater reduction in consumption indices and improvement in economic characters at higher doses suggests the absorption and assimilation of linoleic acid into lipids of high nutritive value to the silkworm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Juvenile hormone analogues {{have been}} tested as insect growth {{regulators}} in silkworm (Bombyx mori), seeking an increment of silk production. These chemical products, when applied in small or moderate rates, promote {{the extension of the}} last larval instar. In the cocoons and silk from 5 th instar B. mori treated with selected doses of methoprene and fenoxycarb. Quantitative parameters like larval <b>weight,</b> <b>silk</b> gland <b>weight,</b> cocoon weight, cocoon shell weight, were determined. Methoprene and fenoxycarb influenced positively the duration of the fifth instar and the weight gain of the insects. Comparatively to the control lot, the increment on silk production was approximately 24 % by the use of 1 ng methoprene...|$|R
25|$|Silks {{derived from}} Bombyx mori are {{generally}} made of two parts: the silk fibroin fiber which contains a light chain of 25kDa {{and a heavy}} chain of 350kDa (or 390kDa) linked by a single disulfide bond and a glue-like protein, sericin, comprising 25 to 30 percentage by <b>weight.</b> <b>Silk</b> fibroin contains hydrophobic Beta sheet blocks, interrupted by small hydrophilic groups. And the beta-sheets contribute much to the high mechanical strength of silk fibers, which achieves 740 MPa, tens of times that of poly(lactic acid) and hundreds of times that of collagen. This impressive mechanical strength has made silk fibroin very competitive for applications in biomaterials. Indeed, silk fibers have {{found their way into}} tendon tissue engineering, where mechanical properties matter greatly. In addition, mechanical properties of silks from various kinds of silkworms vary widely, which provides more choices for their use in tissue engineering.|$|R
40|$|Sericulture or silk {{farming is}} the rearing of {{silkworms}} {{for the production}} of raw silk. The mulberry silkworm, Bombyx mori, is a domesticated and monophagous insect which feeds only on the leaves of mulberry for its nutrition. Thiadiazoles are heterocyclic compounds containing oxygen and nitrogen. 1, 3, 4, thiadiazoles are extensively studied and are known to play diverse biological activities. Diamines or polyamines are found in various biological fluids and are necessary for optimal growth, replication and metabolism of every cell in the body. This report describes the synthesis of diamino substituted thiadiazole and its effect on the growth parameters of Bombyx mori silk worm. Results show that the title compound at high concentration resulted in increased worm <b>weight,</b> <b>silk</b> gland <b>weight</b> and cocoon weight and at low concentrations proved to be beneficial for improving the pupal weight. We conclude that the synthesized compound can be fed to B. mori silk worms for improving their economic parameters...|$|R

30|$|The project (MODHT) has {{produced}} an objective testing scheme for damage assessment with which conservators {{will be able}} to assess and track the condition of the tapestries within their care. This is especially important because of the invisibility of fibre damage: changes at the molecular level have consequences for the physical strength of the tapestry. A new understanding of degradation has been obtained and changes in overall strength and colour can be described {{for the first time in}} chemical terms. The state of the fibre is of vital importance for the overall mechanical integrity of the tapestries and will determine how they will withstand being transferred to other locations for display. The proven correlations between amino acid analysis, molecular <b>weight</b> (<b>silk)</b> and tensile strength (among other markers) of silk and wool confirms the value of applying these analytical results to future conservation strategy. Useful correlations and inter-relationships have been established which will benefit conservators. For example, the analytical techniques could be used to prioritise tapestries for interventive conservation treatment, and also to justify the level of intervention or support required in order to stabilise and display a tapestry. - See more at the projectâ€™s website [63].|$|R

40|$|The strengthness and {{toughness}} of spider {{fiber and}} its multifunctional nature is only surpassed {{in some cases}} by synthetic high performance fibers. In the world of natural fibers, spider silk has been long time recognized as a wonder fiber for its unique combination of high strength and rupture elongation. Scientists in civil military engineering reveal {{that the power of}} biological material (spider silk) lies in the geometric configuration of structural protein, and the small cluster of week hydrogen bonds that works together to resist force and dissipate energy. Each spider and each type of silk has a set of mechanical properties optimized for their biological function. Most silks, in particular deagline silk, have exceptional mechanical properties. They exhibit a unique combination of high tensile strength and extensibility (ductility). This enables a silk fiber to absorb a lot of energy before breaking (toughness, the area under a stress- strain curve). A frequent mistake made in the mainstream media is to confuse strength and toughness when comparing silk to other materials. As shown below in detail, <b>weight</b> for <b>weight,</b> <b>silk</b> is stronger than steel, but not as strong as Kevlar. Silk is,however, tougher than both.

40|$|Poly(lactic acid) (PLA), {{a kind of}} well {{recognized}} biodegradable polymer, {{was reinforced}} by silkworm silk fibers to form a completely biodegradable and biocompatible biocomposite for tissue engineering applications. The influence on the mechanical and thermal properties of the biocomposite {{in relation to the}} length and <b>weight</b> content of <b>silk</b> fibers is studied in this paper. Through the micro-hardness test, optimized fiber length and <b>weight</b> content of <b>silk</b> fibers used to make a better strength silk fiber/PLA biocomposite was determined. Tensile property test and thermal analyses including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) for the silk fiber/PLA biocomposite with specified fiber length and weight content were then conducted to investigate its property changes in comparison to a pristine PLA sample. Experimentally, {{it was found that the}} fiber length and <b>weight</b> content of <b>silk</b> fibers are key parameters that would substantially influence the hardness of the biocomposite samples. For microscopic observations, good wettability of the fibers inside the biocomposite was seen. The surface of the fibers was well bonded with the matrix, as observed by a SEM image of fractured sample. As a result, it was found that the use of silk fibers can be a good candidate, as reinforcements for the development of polymeric scaffolds for tissue engineering applications.
