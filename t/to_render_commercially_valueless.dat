Investigations revealed the existence of dangerously high transients on the DC power bus which extends from the power converter in the antenna pedestal to the amplifier located under the feed. Current and voltage requirements were such as <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>commercially</b> available transient suppressors, including zener diodes, ineffective.

JX Crystals developed a prototype TPV heating stove and generator. It burns natural gas and uses a SiC source emitter operating at 1250 °C and GaSb photocell to output 25,000 BTU/hr simultaneously generating 100 W.

These early settlers gave telling names to the various streams of the region, such as [...] "Sweetwater Creek" [...] or [...] "Poison Creek". Because it was not considered desirable, the area became one of the last strongholds of independent American Indians. Railroad interests seeking rights-of-way through the region also benefited from the popular belief that the land was <b>commercially</b> <b>valueless.</b>|$|R

40|$|This review summarises the {{available}} {{information on the}} biology and ecology of the lithodids at South Georgia and {{provides an overview of}} the development of a management regime for them. Finally it aims to highlight areas in which further research should be directed in order to provide information on which to base the most appropriate assessment and management methods in light of continuing interest in the regional crab fishery. Considerable gaps in our knowledge of the biology, ecology and demography of the lithodid species at South Georgia remain. Uncertainty surrounds estimates of biomass, growth rates and long-term survivorship of discards of the targeted species. In addition, there is doubt surrounding the identification of the less frequently caught species. The ecosystem interactions and function of all lithodids in the region remain poorly understood with great uncertainty surrounding their trophic ecology and life histories. Recent analyses suggest that the current precautionary catch limit may not be sustainable in the long term if it were reached consistently. Further research to address many of the areas outlined above should be undertaken if there is continued interest in the fishery. However, low market value and interest coupled with the very high level of discarding are likely <b>to</b> <b>render</b> the fishery <b>commercially</b> unviable...|$|R

Introduction: Telephone lines were first built {{with only one}} wire, the earth {{being used as a}} return circuit. It was soon found that the telephone receiver was so sensitive to electrical disturbances of all kinds that lines so constructed were rarely free from noises, and were often so seriously affected thereby as <b>to</b> <b>render</b> conversation almost impracticable. As other electrical industries multiplied the troubles increased, especially after the coming of the street railway that insisted upon using the earth as a return circuit for very large current. The disturbances became so great that the telephonists were confronted with a serious problem in an endeavor <b>to</b> <b>render</b> their circuits <b>commercially</b> quiet. A careful study of the origin of noises upon the telephone line revealed them to be due to several causes, leakage, electro-magnetic induction, and electro-static induction. The first that we will take up is leakage. It has been found from experience that few instruments have been invented which are as sensitive a detector for a varying current as the telephone receiver. It has been found that a current of less than a millionth of an ampere will readily effect a telephone receiver. If therefore a telephone line is so situated with respect to other electrical circuits that there can be an actual leakage of electricity to the telephone line, it is certain to produce so much disturbance as <b>to</b> <b>render</b> the use of the line impracticable. Then telephones are operated as grounded circuits, one end of the line is connected to the earth at one station and the other at some distant point. If there is a difference of potential between the earth at the two stations there is a tendency for foreign currents to flow over the line in an endeavor to equalize this difference of potential...|$|R

We present an infrastructure for measuring the precise energy used by a mobile browser <b>to</b> <b>render</b> web pages. We then measure the energy needed <b>to</b> <b>render</b> financial, e-commerce, email, blogging, news and social networking sites. Our tools are sufficiently precise to measure the energy needed <b>to</b> <b>render</b> individual web elements, such as cascade style sheets (CSS), Javascript, images, and plug-in objects. Our results show that for popular sites, downloading and parsing cascade style sheets and Javascript consumes a significant fraction of the total energy needed <b>to</b> <b>render</b> the page. Using the data we collected we make concrete recommendations on how to design web pages so as to minimize the energy needed <b>to</b> <b>render</b> the page. As an example, by modifying scripts on the Wikipedia mobile site we reduced by 30 % the energy needed <b>to</b> download and <b>render</b> Wikipedia pages with no change to the user experience.
