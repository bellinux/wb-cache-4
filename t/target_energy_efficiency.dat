40|$|Abstract: This paper {{studies the}} target {{tracking}} problem in {{wireless sensor networks}} where sensor nodes are deployed randomly. To achieve tracking accuracy constrained by energy consumption, an energy-efficient optimization approach that enables reorganization of wireless sensor networks is proposed. The approach includes three phases which are related to prediction, localization and recovery, respectively. A particle filter algorithm is implemented on the sink node to forecast the future movement of the target in the first prediction phase. Upon the completion of this phase, the most energy efficient sensor nodes are awakened to collaboratively locate the <b>target.</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> is evaluated by the ratio of mutual information to energy consumption. The recovery phase is needed to improve the robustness of the approach. It is performed when the target is missed because of the incorrect predicted target location. In order to recapture the target by awakening additional sensor nodes as few as possible, a genetic-algorithm-based mechanism is introduced to cover the recovery area. We show that the proposed approach has excellent tracking performance. Moreover, it can efficiently reduce energy consumption, prolong network lifetime and reduce network overheads...|$|E

The mean reported heating setpoint temperature was 20. 9 °C and the average weekday and weekend day heating periods were 9. 5 h and 11. 2 h respectively.

40|$|AbstractBuildings consume 40 % {{of total}} {{energy in the}} United States and {{approximately}} 48 % of which is consumed by Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC). This {{highlights the importance of}} developing robust and dynamic Building Monitoring Systems (BMS) that are capable of providing the optimal operation of HVAC systems in terms of maximizing thermal comfort of building occupants while minimizing energy consumptions. Numerous empirical studies have demonstrated that occupant behavior is a key factor underlying energy consumption in existing buildings. However, few if any reliable data sets exist documenting precise human activities and their associated occupant comfort levels within buildings. Furthermore, little if anything is known about how this information directly relates to building energy performance. This research documents on-going development of software prototype tools for modeling thermal comfort in buildings based on real-time occupant and building systems data. The outcomes help building owners to identify areas that require improvements with regard to thermal comfort with broader impacts that improve occupant productivity, comfort, and well-being. The primary technical contribution is to model human comfort on the building level based on actual occupant usage, in order to identify and <b>target</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measures that optimize energy usage according to comfort rather than maximum energy savings alone. Future research will synthesize building occupant and sensor data to support regression analysis that may identify the correlation of the reported thermal comfort, activities of building occupants, and building conditions.

The focus of tax instruments in reducing emissions from electricity generation in selected developing countries. International Business & Economics Research Journal, 14 (1) : 145 - 158. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The objective {{of the study was to}} determine the primary focus of selected developing countries (four BRICS countries; namely, Brazil, China, India and South Africa) in applying tax instruments to reduce their emissions from electricity generation. The focus of tax instruments could be on supply or demand; incentives or disincentives; direct or indirect taxes; and renewable energy, energy efficiency or research and development in these fields. It was found that the tax instruments in South Africa and India focus almost equally on the supply and demand of electricity, while the tax instruments in China focus on the demand side and those in Brazil place slightly more emphasis on the supply side. The primary focus in all the countries studied appears to be the application of incentives, rather than disincentives and the focus of their tax incentives appears to fall equally on the application of direct and indirect taxes, with the exception of South Africa where hardly any indirect tax incentives are applied. Furthermore, there seems to be an almost equal focus on renewable energy, energy efficiency and research and development in the countries studied, with the exception of China where the number of tax instruments specifically aimed at energy efficiency significantly exceeds the number of instruments specifically aimed at renewable energy and research and development.

40|$|Atlanta Conference on Science and Innovation Policy 2011 The present {{research}} {{is an attempt}} to explore pathways to low carbon economy leading to economic growth and employment generation in the transport sector. There are, however, promises and challenges for policy innovation and conflicts and paradoxes to be resolved for meeting overall goals of energy security, social equity and climate change solutions. India is endowed with a great potential to meet these challenges as according to an estimate India has a market value of £ 191 billion in low-carbon and environmental goods & services (LCEGS). With a 6 percent share of the £ 3, 046 -billion global market, the country is tied with Japan at the third position. Another country which is closer is Germany with 4 percent share at the fourth position. Hence, it probes whether policies that <b>target</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> could ameliorate or exacerbate the energy conservation and greenhouse gas reduction efforts. Are these policies adequate to integrate economic and environmental objectives? Are commonly accepted eco-friendly renewable technologies free from any adverse environmental and economic consequences threatening food and water security?

This will analyse the role of and interactions between different actors (Energy technology innovators, investors & venture capital, public research infrastructure), institutions (energy technology innovation policies, laws, and regulation), learning process (research collaboration, FDI & OFDI). It is contended that given the complex energy situation, the instruments will have to be drawn from a broader policy menu and not only from regulatory and promotional mechanisms.

40|$|Buildings {{account for}} {{approximately}} 40 % {{of the energy}} demand and 33 % of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union. Accordingly, there are several efforts that <b>target</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> in buildings both at the European and Swedish levels. The role of buildings in climate change mitigation, however, {{is not limited to}} energy savings. Buildings are expected to become key elements of the future smart energy systems by supplying and using energy in a more flexible way. Reducing the energy demand in buildings effectively and shifting the role of buildings in energy systems from ‘passive’ consumers to ‘active’ prosumers, however, require close interaction and cooperation between the energy and buildings sectors. Based on the data collected from interviews and a web survey, this doctoral thesis investigates the relationship between the energy and buildings sectors in Sweden at the inter-company level, presents key stakeholder views on smart energy features in buildings and investigates the opportunities and barriers for their adoption in Sweden and Hong Kong. The results of this thesis suggest a potential for improving the cooperation between the Swedish energy and buildings sectors, which was identified to be influenced by the following factors: district heating monopolies; energy efficiency efforts in the buildings sector; unsuccessful technology-neutrality of the building regulations; self-generation systems in buildings; and energy use patterns. Shifting the focus from self-gains to mutual gains appears crucial to strengthen the inter-sectoral cooperation, as there are several opportunities for achieving mutually beneficial solutions for the two sectors. This would, however, require significant changes in current practices and business models as well as the introduction of new technologies, which would allow for a more flexible energy supply and use. Accordingly, technologies that target flexible energy use in buildings are considered the most important smart energy features in buildings. The current high costs of technologies, such as home automation and smart electrical appliances, however, create the strongest barrier to adoption. Therefore, the introduction of new business and ownership models and the elimination of the institutional and regulatory barriers are crucial to achieve a wide-scale development of smart energy features in buildings. The results from Hong Kong suggest that institutional and regulatory barriers can particularly create strong hinders to the adoption of technologies. It is possible to achieve more sustainable energy systems, where buildings are active elements of networks that supply and use energy in a more flexible and ‘smarter’ way. Cooperation between the energy and buildings sectors can {{play a key role in}} the adoption of smart energy features in buildings and pave the way for the smart built environment of the future...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{supply in}} Sweden year 2011 {{amounted}} to 577 TWh. The {{final energy consumption}} for industrial, residential and service was 379 TWh. Sweden has energy policy goals to reduce energy use in buildings. One of these goals {{is to reduce the}} energy use by 20 % in 2020 compared to the year 1995. An important step to achieve this goal is to <b>target</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measures in existing buildings. There are also financial incentives to implement energy efficiency measures {{due to the fact that}} the cost of energy represents 30 - 40 % of a buildings maintenance costs. In general, up to 20 % of the energy consumption can be reduced without major reconstruction. In this master thesis project presented here, an energy audit was performed and energy efficiency measures was proposed for an existing building located at Järfälla, Stockholm. The property belongs to SAAB - Defence and Security. They have an internal target to reduce energy use in their buildings with 50  % by 2015 compared to 2009. The work of this master thesis project was limited to a building locally termed hus A. This part of the property is the oldest and was built in 1968, but has expanded gradually to the year 1977. Hus A contains of offices, a production hall, laboratories and storage areas. The energy audit showed that the electricity use is far greater in hus A, compared to the an average office and administration building. This is mainly due to production processes. A breakdown of the highest electricity consumers are: Industrial processes – 61. 9 kWh/m 2 /year Lighting – 35. 7 kWh/m 2 /year Fans – 33. 2 kWh/m 2 /year Refrigeration – 21. 8 kWh/m 2 /year Compressed air – 18. 9 kWh/m 2 /year Computer units – 7. 8 kWh/m 2 /year Frequency converters – 4. 4 kWh/m 2 /year Waste heat from industrial processes, primarily from the production hall leads to high cooling demand to maintain good thermal comfort. Limitations in operation control of the buildings HVAC (Heating, Cooling and Air-conditioning) systems causes high heating and cooling demand and hence the buildings thermal mass is not properly utilized. Energy saving measures was mainly focused on increasing the controlling capability of HVAC systems. By implementing the energy efficiency measures presented in this master thesis report, building thermal mass will be more efficiently utilized. In addition, end use of electricity, heat and cooling will be reduced. In total, seven energy-saving measures proposed.  One measure is implemented to prevent heating and cooling at the same time.

40|$|Mención Internacional en el título de doctorWith {{the rise}} of cloud computing, data centers have been called to play a main role in the Internet {{scenario}} nowadays. Despite this relevance, they are probably far from their zenith yet due to the ever increasing demand of contents to be stored in and distributed by the cloud, the need of computing power or the larger and larger amounts of data being analyzed by top companies such as Google, Microsoft or Amazon. However, everything {{is not always a}} bed of roses. Having a data center entails two major issues: they are terribly expensive to build, and they consume huge amounts of power being, therefore, terribly expensive to maintain. For this reason, cutting down the cost of building and increasing the energy efficiency (and hence reducing the carbon footprint) of data centers {{has been one of the}} hottest research topics during the last years. In this thesis we propose different techniques that can have an impact in both the building and the maintenance costs of data centers of any size, from small scale to large flagship data centers. The first part of the thesis is devoted to structural issues. We start by analyzing the bisection (band) width of a topology, of product graphs in particular, a useful parameter to compare and choose among different data center topologies. In that same part we describe the problem of deploying the servers in a data center as a Multidimensional Arrangement Problem (MAP) and propose a heuristic to reduce the deployment and wiring costs. We <b>target</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> in data centers in the second part of the thesis. We first propose a method to reduce the energy consumption in the data center network: rate adaptation. Rate adaptation is based on the idea of energy proportionality and aims to consume power on network devices proportionally to the load on their links. Our analysis proves that just using rate adaptation we may achieve average energy savings in the order of a 30 - 40 % and up to a 60 % depending on the network topology. We continue by characterizing the power requirements of a data center server given that, in order to properly increase the energy efficiency of a data center, we first need to understand how energy is being consumed. We present an exhaustive empirical characterization of the power requirements of multiple components of data center servers, namely, the CPU, the disks, and the network card. To do so, we devise different experiments to stress these components, taking into account the multiple available frequencies as well as the fact that we are working with multicore servers. In these experiments, we measure their energy consumption and identify their optimal operational points. Our study proves that the curve that defines the minimal power consumption of the CPU, as a function of the load in Active Cycles Per Second (ACPS), is neither concave nor purely convex. Moreover, it definitively has a superlinear dependence on the load. We also validate the accuracy of the model derived from our characterization by running different Hadoop applications in diverse scenarios obtaining an error below 4 : 1 % on average. The last topic we study is the Virtual Machine Assignment problem (VMA), i. e., optimizing how virtual machines (VMs) are assigned to physical machines (PMs) in data centers. Our optimization target is to minimize the power consumed by all the PMs when considering that power consumption depends superlinearly on the load. We study four different VMA problems, depending on whether the number of PMs and their capacity are bounded or not. We study their complexity and perform an offline and online analysis of these problems. The online analysis is complemented with simulations that show that the online algorithms we propose consume substantially less power than other state of the art assignment algorithms.

Given the value chain of energy production shows several aspects to be improved, this paper intends to identify the economic sectors where investment should be allocated {{in order to reach}} the <b>targeted</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> levels in the overall economic system. We expect that an improvement in <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> will bring a fall in electricity demand. Simulating these impacts will enable an assessment of the macroeconomic effects of such demand-side changes in Spain. For simulation purposes, we will use input–output methodology, based on data from a Spanish input–output table from the year 2012 that we have constructed. The scenario used for modeling has been obtained from the objectives proposed by the European Union for 2030, specifically the one promoting an increase to at least a 27 % increase in <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> compared with the business-as-usual scenario. This demand-side model enables us to measure the potential sector-by-sector growth of the Spanish economy and to calculate households’ expected savings in energy bills due to the implementation of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measures. The impacts of employment and CO 2 emissions are also quantified {{as a result of the}} investments aimed at improving <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency.</b> energy; <b>energy</b> efficiency; input–output analysis; CO 2 emissions; Spai...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{possibilities}} of <b>targeting</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> potentials in German companies by delivering information and support within a cooperative management system “Learning <b>Energy</b> <b>Efficiency</b> Networks” (LEEN). Information deficits are pointed {{out as a}} relevant barrier to implementing <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measures in literature that can be aimed at by energy programmes such as audits. Our concept combines aspects of cooperation, shared experiences and moderated learning processes. The programme sought {{to go beyond the}} sole provision of consultation, by qualifying companies to decide and act on implementing <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measures by delivering the individual practical know-how they need. After having analysed evaluation data of several hundred companies, our results show that the participants were mainly motivated by the need for practical knowledge and specific information. The networks could well satisfy this need. The benefit for the participants in such delivered information was also reflected in the decreasing of the barrier of imperfect information and the programme enabled companies to make informed decisions on <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measures. But the gain of the programme was not solely restricted on an increase in knowledge: The majority of participants reported implementation of suggested measures, which would not have been implemented without the programme. Hence, LEEN can be indicated as a policy instrument enabling informed decisions on efficiency measures and supporting their implementation. Possibly tailoring the programme to different target groups and aiming at dismantling other barriers directly in addition to tackling information deficits could be undertaken to improve the process...|$|R

It {{can be used to}} easily estimate the energy saving potential of occupancy-based smart heating for a given household. Additionally, the method readily scales. Statistical data on buildings’ characteristics in an area provided, it could be deployed by e.g. municipalities to identify the households with highest potential for energy savings in their territory, and <b>target</b> their <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measuresaccordingly.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the future role of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> as a resource in the Western United States and Canada, as envisioned {{in the most recent}} resource plans issued by 16 utilities, representing about 60 percent of the region's load. Utility and third-party administered <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> programs proposed by 15 utilities over a ten-year horizon would save almost 19, 000 GWh annually, about 5. 2 percent of forecast load. There are clear regional trends in the aggressiveness of proposed energy savings. California's investor-owned utilities (IOUs) had the most aggressive savings targets, followed by IOUs in the Pacific Northwest, and the lowest savings were proposed by utilities in Inland West states and by two public utilities on the West coast. The adoption of multiple, aggressive policies <b>targeting</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> and climate change appear to produce sizeable <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> commitments. Certain specific policies, such as mandated energy savings goals for California's IOUs and <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> provisions in Nevada's Renewable Portfolio Standard had a direct impact on the level of energy savings included in the resource plans. Other policies, such as revenue decoupling and shareholder incentives, and voluntary or legislatively mandated greenhouse gas emission reduction policies, may have also impacted utilities' <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> commitments, though the effects of these policies are not easily measured. Despite progress among the utilities in our sample, more aggressive <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> strategies that include high-efficiency standards for additional appliances and equipment, tighter building codes for new construction and renovation, as well as more comprehensive ratepayer-funded <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> programs are likely to be necessary to achieve a region-wide goal of meeting 20 percent of electricity demand with efficiency in 2020...|$|R
40|$|Housing {{represents}} about 29 % {{of the total}} energy consumption in Europe and contributes with around 20 % of emissions (European Commission 2013).
