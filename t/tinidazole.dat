5|$|Antibiotics are {{not usually}} used for gastroenteritis, {{although}} they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates {{of resistance to the}} latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, <b>tinidazole</b> treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.|$|E

25|$|Methods of {{prevention}} include not having sex, using condoms, not douching, and being tested for STIs before {{having sex with}} a new partner. Trichomoniasis can be cured with antibiotics, either metronidazole or <b>tinidazole.</b> Sexual partners should also be treated. About 20% of people get infected again within three months of treatment.|$|E

50|$|The World Health Organization and Infectious Disease Society of America {{recommend}} metronidazole {{as first}} line therapy. The US CDC lists metronidazole, <b>tinidazole,</b> and nitazoxanide as effective first-line therapies; of these three, only nitazoxanide and <b>tinidazole</b> are approved {{for the treatment}} of giardiasis by the US FDA. A meta-analysis done by the Cochrane Collaboration found that compared to the standard of metronidazole, albendazole had equivalent efficacy while having fewer side effects, such as gastrointestinal or neurologic issues. Other meta-analyses have reached similar conclusions. Both medications need a five to 10 day long course; albendazole is taken once a day, while metronidazole needs to be taken three times a day. The evidence for comparing metronidazole to other alternatives such as mebendazole, <b>tinidazole</b> or nitazoxanide was felt to be of very low quality. While <b>tinidazole</b> has side effects and efficacy similar to those of metronidazole, it is administered with a single dose.|$|E

50|$|Infection {{is treated}} and cured with {{metronidazole}} or <b>tinidazole.</b> The CDC recommends a one time dose of 2 grams of either metronidazole or <b>tinidazole</b> as the first-line treatment; the alternate treatment recommended is 500 milligrams of metronidazole, twice daily, {{for seven days}} if there is failure of the single-dose regimen. Medication should be prescribed to any sexual partner(s) as well because they may be asymptomatic carriers.|$|E
5000|$|Metronidazole, or {{a related}} drug such as <b>Tinidazole,</b> Secnidazole or Ornidazole, {{is used to}} destroy amoebae that have invaded tissue.|$|E
50|$|It is {{sold under}} many trade names {{worldwide}} and in combinations with cefixime, nimesulide, ambroxol, and with both <b>tinidazole</b> and fluconazole.|$|E
50|$|According to a study, <b>tinidazole</b> {{used with}} {{doxycycline}} or azithromycin may cure NGU better than when doxycycline or azithromycin is used alone.|$|E

50|$|For {{people who}} are symptomatic, it is used after {{treatment}} with ambecides that can penetrate tissue, like metronidazole or <b>tinidazole.</b> Diloxanide is considered second-line, while paromomycin is considered first line for this use as well.|$|E
50|$|This {{nitroimidazole}} compound, like metronidazole, {{has shown}} a marked therapeutic response in amoebic liver abscess. Occasional side effects include nausea and dizziness. <b>Tinidazole</b> is not widely available though it {{is more effective than}} metronidazole. Zuberi and Ibrahim found <b>tinidazole</b> to be effective in 86.7% cases of intestinal amoebiasis and in 100% cases of amoebic liver abscess.Luminal amoebicides like halogenated oxyquinolines, e.g. diiodohydroxyquinoline in a dose of 0.6 G. thrice daily for 3 weeks, diloxanide furoate 0.5 G. three times a day for 10 days and sometimes tetracyclines 1-2 G./day for 5 days should be used concurrently with any of the above drugs as adjuncts to eliminate intestinal infection.|$|E
50|$|Treatment is {{not always}} {{necessary}} as the infection usually resolves on its own. However, if the illness is acute or symptoms persist and medications are needed to treat it, a nitroimidazole medication is used such as metronidazole, <b>tinidazole,</b> secnidazole or ornidazole.|$|E

50|$|Metronidazole, or {{a related}} drug such as <b>tinidazole,</b> {{secnidazole}} or ornidazole, {{is used to}} destroy amoebae that have invaded tissue. These are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and transported {{to the site of}} infection. Because they are rapidly absorbed there is almost none remaining in the intestine.|$|E

Therapy other than 5-nitroimidazole drugs is also an option, but cure rates are much lower.|$|E
50|$|Diloxanide is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} amoeba infections. It is a second line treatment after paromomycin when no symptoms are present in places where infections are not common. For people who are symptomatic, it is used after treatment with metronidazole or <b>tinidazole.</b> It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tinidazole</b> is an anti-parasitic drug {{used against}} {{protozoan}} infections. It is widely known throughout Europe and {{the developing world}} {{as a treatment for}} a variety of amoebic and parasitic infections. It was developed in 1972. A derivative of 2-methylimidazole, it is a prominent member of the nitroimidazole antibiotics.|$|E
50|$|Methods of {{prevention}} include not having sex, using condoms, not douching, and being tested for STIs before {{having sex with}} a new partner. Trichomoniasis can be cured with antibiotics, either metronidazole or <b>tinidazole.</b> Sexual partners should also be treated. About 20% of people get infected again within three months of treatment.|$|E
50|$|The {{treatment}} of invasive amoebiasis {{should be directed}} to all sites where E. histolytica may be present. Hence the ideal amoebicide {{should be able to}} act within the intestinal lumen, in the intestinal wall, and systemically, particularly in the liver. Systemic amoebicidal drugs include emetine, dehydroemetine, chloroquine diphosphate, metronidazole, and <b>tinidazole.</b>|$|E
50|$|Prevention is {{typically}} by improved hygiene. Those without symptoms do not usually need treatment. When symptoms are present treatment {{is typically}} with either <b>tinidazole</b> or metronidazole. People may become temporarily lactose intolerant after an infection {{and therefore it}} is often recommended milk be avoided for a few weeks. Resistance to treatment may occur.|$|E
5000|$|Compared to {{the spiral}} form, spheroplasts of B. burgdorferi have reduced surface area exposed to immune surveillance. They also express some {{different}} surface proteins from spirochetes. B. burgdorferi spheroplasts have shown sensitivity in vitro to antiparasitic drugs, such as metronidazole, <b>tinidazole,</b> and hydroxychloroquine [...] {{to which the}} spiral form of B. burgdorferi is not sensitive.|$|E
5000|$|A 14-day {{course of}} [...] "quadruple therapy" [...] with a proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, tetracycline, and {{metronidazole}} or <b>tinidazole</b> {{is a more}} complicated but also more effective regimen. In a 2011 randomized, controlled trial, the per protocol eradication rates were 93% with quadruple therapy and 70% with triple therapy. Bismuth-based quadruple therapy is recommended as first line therapy for patients in areas with high clarithromycin resistance (> 20%), in patients who have previously been treated with a macrolide antibiotic, or as second-line therapy for patients whose infection persists after an initial course of triple therapy. Several studies reported eradication rates of > 90% using a 10-day sequential regimen consisting of four drugs: a proton pump inhibitor and amoxicillin for 5 days, followed by a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin, and <b>tinidazole</b> for 5 days. However, subsequent studies confirmed equivalent or superior efficacy when all four drugs were given concomitantly for 10 days (non-bismuth quadruple therapy).|$|E
50|$|Antibiotics such as metronidazole, <b>tinidazole,</b> cephamandole, latamoxef, cefoperazone, cefmenoxime, and furazolidone, cause a disulfiram-like {{chemical}} reaction with alcohol by inhibiting its breakdown by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which {{may result in}} vomiting, nausea, and shortness of breath. In addition, the efficacy of doxycycline and erythromycin succinate may be reduced by alcohol consumption. Other effects of alcohol on antibiotic activity include altered activity of the liver enzymes that break down the antibiotic compound.|$|E
50|$|Prevention of {{amoebiasis}} is by improved sanitation, including separating {{food and}} water from faeces. There is no vaccine. There are two treatment options depending on {{the location of the}} infection. Amoebiasis in tissues is treated with either metronidazole, <b>tinidazole,</b> nitazoxanide, dehydroemetine or chloroquine, while luminal infection is treated with diloxanide furoate or iodoquinoline. For treatment to be effective against all stages of disease may require a combination of medications. Infections without symptoms do not require treatment but infected individuals can spread the parasite to others and treatment can be considered. Treatment of other Entamoeba infections apart from E. histolytica is not needed.|$|E
