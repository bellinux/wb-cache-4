5|$|In any event, the {{molluscs}} and scavengers did not consume everything organic. Some of {{the wooden}} objects on the ship and in <b>the</b> <b>debris</b> field have not been consumed, particularly those made of teak, a dense wood {{that seems to have}} resisted the borers. The First Class reception area off the ships Grand Staircase is still remarkably intact and furniture is still visible among <b>the</b> <b>debris</b> on the floor. Although most of the corridors have lost their walls, furniture is still in place in many cabins; in one, a mattress is still on the bed, with an intact and undamaged dresser behind it. Robert Ballard has suggested that areas within the ship or buried under debris, where scavengers may {{not have been able to}} reach, may still contain human remains. According to Charles Pellegrino, who dived on Titanic in 2001, a finger bone encircled by the partial remains of a wedding ring was found concreted to the bottom of a soup tureen that was retrieved from <b>the</b> <b>debris</b> field.

40|$|New 3. 5 kHz {{profiles}} and {{a series}} of piston cores from the north-west African margin provide evidence that <b>the</b> Saharan <b>debris</b> flow travelled for more than 400 km on a highly fluid, low-friction layer of poorly sorted sediment. Data suggest that <b>the</b> Saharan <b>debris</b> flow is a two-phase event, consisting of a basal, volcaniclastic debris flow phase overlain by a pelagic debris flow phase. Both phases were emplaced on the lower continental rise by a single large debris flow at around 60 ka. The volcaniclastic flow left a thin deposit less than 5 m thick. This contrasts with the much thicker (over 25 m) deposit left by <b>the</b> pelagic <b>debris</b> flow phase. We suggest that pelagic sediment, sourced and mobilized as <b>debris</b> flow from <b>the</b> African continental margin, loaded and destabilized volcaniclastic material {{in the vicinity of the}} western Canaries. When subjected to this loading, the volcaniclastic material appears to have formed a highly fluid sandy debris flow, capable of transporting with it the huge volumes of pelagic debris, and contributing to a runout distance extending over 400 km downslope of the Canary Islands on slopes that decrease to as little as 0. 05 °. It is likely that <b>the</b> pelagic <b>debris</b> formed a thick impermeable slab above <b>the</b> volcanic <b>debris,</b> thus maintaining high pore pressures generated by loading and giving rise to low apparent friction conditions. The distribution of <b>the</b> two <b>debris</b> phases indicates that <b>the</b> volcaniclastic <b>debris</b> flow stopped within a few tens of kilometres after escaping from beneath <b>the</b> pelagic <b>debris</b> flow, probably because of dissipation of excess pore pressure when the seal of pelagic material was removed...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the influence of}} landslide dams on surface water drainage and groundwater flow. In the study area of Scanno Lake and Sagittario River (Central Italy), a limestone rockslide-avalanche formed a lake, which has an outlet that is occasionally active, showing infiltration into the rockslide dam. Several springs are present at the lake's base and are partly fed by seepage through <b>the</b> rockslide <b>debris.</b> Piezometric surveys, discharge measurements, pumping tests and chemical analyses are tools used to build a conceptual model of the groundwater flow and to evaluate the flow through <b>the</b> rockslide <b>debris.</b> Seasonal water isotopic signatures validate the assumed model, showing a mixing of infiltration recharge and groundwater seepage throughout <b>the</b> rockslide <b>debris.</b> Various recharge areas have been found for springs, pointing out those directly fed by <b>the</b> rockslide <b>debris</b> aquifer. Hypotheses about seasonal groundwater mixing between the regional carbonate aquifer and <b>the</b> rockslide <b>debris</b> aquifer are supported by isotope results. Seasonal changes in groundwater table level due to recharge and surface losses from seasonal outlet have been correlated with isotopic groundwater composition from <b>the</b> rockslide <b>debris</b> aquifer and <b>the</b> downstream springs; this relationship highlights {{the role of the}} rockslide dam body on the hydrodynamics of the studied area. Relationships between surface waters and groundwater in the area have been completely understood on the basis of water isotopic fingerprinting, finally obtaining a complete evaluation of groundwater renewable resources and its regimen.

40|$|<b>The</b> space <b>debris</b> model MASTER- 2009 {{is based}} on the {{simulation}} of historical fragmentation events that actually occurred up to a reference epoch. <b>The</b> simulated <b>debris</b> distribution is compared with measured data. In this way, the model is validated. The validated population can only be given up to the date when the latest version of the model has been published. The latest version of the model was created for May of 2009. Trends for the future population were assumed relating to an expected rate of fragmentation events. It is necessary to continuously update the population. Since the year 2009, further fragmentations have occurred. In this paper, the additional events between the years 2009 and 2013 are examined and added to the existing population. It will be shown how the population has changed over these years. Many of <b>the</b> released <b>debris</b> during this period already have re-entered into the Earth's atmosphere due to the residual atmospheric drag. Overall, however, a further increase of space debris can be observed. The individual additional events are simulated. <b>The</b> simulated <b>debris</b> clouds are propagated to a new reference epoch. The results are presented as spatial density and compared with the population of 2009. In this way, the additional contribution to <b>the</b> space <b>debris</b> environment of <b>the</b> recent years is presented. The presentation refers exclusively to the fragments. Other contributions to space debris are not considered here. A particular risk exists for debris objects, which are larger than one centimeter.
