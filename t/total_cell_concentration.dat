40|$|The surface {{properties}} of Bacillus licheniformis DSM 603 {{have been examined}} {{as a function of}} age during cultures in baffled and non-baffled Erlenmeyer flasks, at 30 and 37 degrees C. The elemental composition of the surface was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and its variation was compared with the electrophoretic mobility and water contact angle. The variations of the surface phosphate concentration during the cultures and according to growth conditions indicate that the determining factor is the <b>total</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentration.</b> The P/C atomic concentration ratio remains in a range where its variation does not influence the electrophoretic mobility. The decrease and increase of hydrophobicity during cultures at 30 degrees C in baffled and normal flasks, respectively, are paralleled by a variation in the O/C ratio...|$|E

The cells' spatial arrangements and interconnectivities, both critical elements of higher-order function, derive from complex developmental programs in vivo {{and are often}} difficult or impossible to emulate in vitro. Here, we report the bottom-up synthesis of microtissues composed of multiple cell types with programmed connectivity. We functionalized cells with short oligonucleotides to impart specific adhesive properties. Hybridization of complementary DNA sequences enabled the assembly of multicellular structures with defined cell–cell contacts. We demonstrated that the kinetic parameters of the assembly process depend on DNA sequence complexity, density, and <b>total</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentration.</b> Thus, cell assembly can be highly controlled, enabling the design of microtissues with defined cell composition and stoichiometry.

The relationship between DNA concentration and epifluorescence total direct cell concentration in 11 different drinking water samples was linear and positive; the amounts of DNA per cell in these samples {{did not differ significantly}} from the amounts in pure culture isolates. We found significant linear correlations between DNA concentration and colony-forming unit concentration, as well as between epifluorescence direct cell counts and colony-forming unit concentration.

40|$|DNA, RNA, {{and protein}} {{concentrations}} from starved ANT- 300 cell populations grown at different growth rates fluctuated {{corresponding to the}} three stages of starvation-survival on <b>total</b> and viable <b>cell</b> bases. During stage 1 of starvation-survival, two to three peaks in the concentration levels for all three macromolecules were characteristic. During stage 2, DNA per <b>total</b> <b>cell</b> dropped to between 4. 2 and 8. 3 % of the original amount {{for all of the}} cell populations examined, and it stabilized throughout stage 3. The decrease in DNA per cell was also observed in electron micrographs of cellular DNA in unstarved compared with starved cells. The fluctuations of RNA and protein per <b>total</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrations</b> observed during stage 2 coincided in all cases, except for the cells from dilution rate (D) = 0. 015 h− 1. This ANT- 300 cell population showed a decrease in RNA per <b>total</b> <b>cell</b> to only 29. 2 % and an increase in protein to 129. 7 % of the original amount after 98 days of starvation. During stage 3, DNA, RNA, and protein <b>concentrations</b> per <b>total</b> <b>cell</b> also stabilized to continuous levels. Cells from the faster-growth-rate cell populations of D = 0. 170 h− 1 and batch culture had elevated protein per <b>total</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrations,</b> which remained primarily residual during the starvation period. Starved cells from D = 0. 015 h− 1 had estimated nucleoid and cell volumes of 0. 018 and 0. 05 μm 3, respectively, yielding a nucleoid volume/cell volume ratio of 0. 40.

The efficiency of drinking water pasteurization by using the PTC was studied {{with a combination of}} analytical methods including flow-cytometric determination of <b>total</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentration</b> and enumeration of cells with damaged membranes before and after treatment. Fluorescent staining of all microbial cells with two nucleic acid stains, SYBR Green I and Propidium Iodide (live/dead staining), was used. The effectiveness of the pasteurizer to inactivate spiked Escherichia coli cells in contaminated water was also investigated. Flow-cytometric analysis revealed that cellular membranes of all microbial cells were strongly damaged after exposure in all the tested water samples. The pasteurizer reached a maximum daily water production of 66 L on a sunny day and was stable in its E. coli reduction rates. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the pasteurization temperature of 87 C is able to inactivate bacterial cells in drinking water. Despite this, water pasteurized in this way is not sterile and has to be consumed quickly, since treated water samples incubated at 30 C for 72 h exhibited a potential microbial regrowth...|$|E

The inflammatory response in the alveoli and lung interstitium may also be reflected by increased bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid concentrations of extracellular matrix components. The present study investigated the influence of smoking on the BAL fluid concentrations of albumin (ALB), hyaluronan (HA) and fibronectin (FN). Lavage fluids from 18 smokers were analysed before and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 15 months after smoking cessation. Never-smokers (n= 112) served as a reference group. The <b>total</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentration</b> and the concentrations of macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils were higher (P< 0 · 001 – 0 · 01) in smokers' BAL fluid than in never-smokers', but the values returned to normal within 9 months of smoking cessation. The HA concentration was higher (P< 0 · 001) in smokers' than in never-smokers' BAL fluid, but FN and ALB did not differ. Transient increases in the concentrations of ALB and HA (P< 0 · 01 for both) was observed within 6 months of smoking cessation. These findings indicate a temporary heightened alveolar-capillary permeability and an increased production and/or degradation of HA, being enhanced following smoking cessation. The findings probably reflect an initiation of a reparative process...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{measurements}} of physical, {{chemical and biological}} dynamics in groundwater are key to understanding the important processes in place and their influence on water quality – particularly when used for drinking water. Measuring temporal bacterial dynamics at high frequency is challenging due to the limitations in automation of sampling and detection of the conventional, cultivation-based microbial methods. In this study, fully automated online flow cytometry was applied in a groundwater system {{for the first time}} in order to monitor microbial dynamics in a groundwater extraction well. Measurements of bacterial concentrations every 15 [*]minutes during 14 days revealed both aperiodic and periodic dynamics that could not be detected previously, resulting in <b>total</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentration</b> (TCC) fluctuations between 120 and 280 cells μL − 1. The aperiodic dynamic was linked to river water contamination following precipitation events, while the (diurnal) periodic dynamic was attributed to changes in hydrological conditions as a consequence of intermittent groundwater extraction. Based on the high number of measurements, the two patterns could be disentangled and quantified separately. This study i) increases the understanding of system performance, ii) helps to optimize monitoring strategies, and iii) opens the possibility for more sophisticated (quantitative) microbial risk assessment of drinking water treatment systems...|$|E

40|$|A {{culture of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae M 30 {{entrapped}} in loofa-reinforced alginate {{was used for}} continuous ethanol fermentation in a packed-bed reactor with initial sugar concentrations of 200 - 248 g/L. Maximum ethanol productivity of 11. 5 g/(L·h) was obtained at an ethanol concentration of 57. 4 g/L, an initial sugar concentration of 220 g/L and a dilution rate (D) of 0. 2 h- 1. However, a maximum ethanol concentration of 82. 1 g/L (productivity of 9. 0 g/(L·h)) was obtained at a D of 0. 11 h- 1. Ethanol productivity in the continuous culture was 6 - 8 -fold higher than that in the batch culture. Due to the developed carrier’s high biocompatibility, high porosity, and good mechanical strength, advantages such as cell regeneration, reusability, altered mechanical strength, and high capacity to trap active cells in the reactor were achieved in this study. The immobilized cell reactor was successfully operated for 30 days without any loss in ethanol productivity. The average conversion yield was 0. 43 - 0. 45 throughout the entire operation, with an immobilization yield of 47. 5 %.

40|$|The general {{microbial}} {{quality of}} drinking water is normally monitored by heterotrophic plate counts (HPC). This method {{has been used for}} more than 100 years and is recommended in drinking water guidelines. However, the HPC method is handicapped because it is time-consuming and restricted to culturable bacteria. Recently, rapid and accurate detection methods have emerged, such as adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) measurements to assess microbial activity in drinking water, and flow cytometry (FCM) to determine the <b>total</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentration</b> (TCC). It is necessary and important for drinking water quality control to understand the relationships among the conventional and new methods. In the current study, all three methods were applied to 200 drinking water samples obtained from two local buildings connected to the same distribution system. Samples were taken both on normal working days and weekends, and the correlations between the different microbiological parameters were determined. TCC in the samples ranged from 0. 37 &ndash; 5. 61 &times; 10 5 cells/ml, and two clusters, the so-called high (HNA) and low (LNA) nucleic acid bacterial groups, were clearly distinguished. The results showed that the rapid determination methods (i. e., FCM and ATP) correlated well (R 2 = 0. 69), but only a weak correlation (R 2 = 0. 31) was observed between the rapid methods and conventional HPC data.

Further, in certain instances, the <b>total</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentration</b> of a suspension may be estimated by nephelometric comparison, by weighing the washed and dried sediments obtained from centrifuged aliquotsl or by measuring a product of metabolism.

V. harveyi became nonculturable but maintained viability during starvation at 4 degrees C and maintained both culturability and viability at 30 degrees C. In contrast, E. coli became viable but nonculturable during starvation at 30 degrees C but not at 4 degrees C. Luminescence of nonculturable cells of both strains, and culturable cells of V. harveyi, decreased to background levels during starvation. Luminescence of starved culturable cells of E. coli also fell below background levels but occasionally increased to detectable values. Viable, nonculturable forms of P. fluorescens were not detected at either temperature, and cells starved at 4 degrees C showed no decrease in luminescence measured during incubation of samples at 25 degrees C. Following incubation of late-log-phase cells with yeast extract and nalidixic acid, changes in light output directly paralleled changes in cell length, as observed during direct viable counting. Quantification of changes in luminescence following incubation of starved cells with yeast extract enabled measurement of the activity of both culturable and viable but nonculturable cells.

While conventional virus quantification methods give only virus titres in the culture broth, data obtained by fluorescence labelling of intracellular virus proteins provide additional information on infection dynamics. Flow cytometry represents a valuable tool to investigate the influences of cultivation conditions and process variations on virus replication and virus yields. Results In this study, fluorescein-labelled monoclonal antibodies against influenza A virus matrix protein 1 and nucleoprotein were used for monitoring the infection status of adherent Madin-Darby canine kidney cells from bioreactor samples. Monoclonal antibody binding was shown for influenza A virus strains of different subtypes (H 1 N 1, H 1 N 2, H 3 N 8) and host specificity (human, equine, swine). At high multiplicity of infection in a bioreactor, the onset of viral protein accumulation in adherent cells on microcarriers was detected at about 2 to 4 h post infection by flow cytometry. In contrast, {{a significant increase in}} titre by hemagglutination assay was detected at the earliest 4 to 6 h post infection. Conclusion It is shown that flow cytometry is a sensitive and robust method for the monitoring of viral infection in fixed cells from bioreactor samples. Therefore, it is a valuable addition to other detection methods of influenza virus infection such as immunotitration and RNA hybridisation. Thousands of individual cells are measured per sample. Thus, the presented method is believed to be quite independent of the concentration of infected cells (multiplicity of infection and <b>total</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentration)</b> in bioreactors.

Total chlorophyll a, total lipids, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, fatty acids and major phytoplankton group concentration (i. e. dinoflagellates, diatoms, ciliates and cysts) were studied in 7 -hour intervals in February 2007. Our results indicate {{a high concentration of}} potential available food in the form of lipids ranging from 50 to 300 μg L- 1 for benthic suspension feeders, i. e. bivalves. The dominance of P. reticulatum (60 - 80 % of the <b>total</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentration</b> per litre, ranging from 55 x 103 to 384 x 103 cells L- 1) can be considered as a possible interference for harvesting in this productive area, although the toxicity of this algae was not proved in the present study.

Current techniques for monitoring glucose and lactate concentrations in cell culture media require invasive and tedious handling of the sample for sterile media removal and nutrient replacement. Even though in situ or ex situ analyte monitoring systems have been tried for on-line measurement, they suffer from difficulties including the inability to keep them sterile, their limited lifetime, and their lack of stability. In order to optimize cell culture growth in bioreactors, biosensors must be developed that are capable of monitoring cell culture parameters such as analyte concentration and cell concentration non-invasively and continuously. For this research, noninvasive determinations of glucose and lactate in cell culture media were investigated using near-infrared spectroscopy across the 2. 0 - 2. 5 mm spectral region. A system was developed using a Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer and optical fibers to characterize glucose and lactate absorbance spectra in cell culture media from hybridoma cell culture. Partial least squares (PLS) regression has been used to extract the analyte-dependent information and to build a successful multivariate calibration model. Calibration, using a combination of spectra from cell culture media and spiked sample media mixtures, was performed and applied to an independent validation data set, producing a prediction error of 1. 7 % and 9. 8 % for glucose and lactate, respectively. In addition, a noninvasive optical cell density monitoring system based on a laser turbidity sensor was developed. The <b>total</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentration</b> predicted with optical method was in excellent agreement with off-line cell counting data.

Aminopeptidase profiling is a method that uses metabolic characteristics of microorganisms {{as a means for}} identification.

In order to improve the efficiency of aminopeptidase profiling, a fluorimeter that combines the selectivity of time-resolved detection and the sample throughput of a 96 -well plate reader has been developed. The time-resolved 96 -well plate reader allows the sample loading, data collection and analysis for a twenty amino acid profile of four samples to be completed in 30 min. Compared to the 3. 5 hrs required by comparable aminopeptidase techniques, this instrument represents a significant improvement in sample throughput. Research has continued in an attempt to develop libraries of aminopeptidase profiles to be used as standards to identify unknown microorganisms. ^ The future of aminopeptidase profiling will be enhanced further by the development of a multiple channel, microfabricated capillary electrophoresis device.

In addition to the quantification of the infected cell fraction, influenza A virus nucleoprotein and matrix protein copy numbers in cells could be estimated from the measured fluorescence intensities.

40|$|Cell {{concentration}} {{is a primary}} characteristic of fermentation processes. The <b>total</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentration</b> in a particle-free liquid medium can be easily assessed by cell counts, optical density or dry weight. The quantification of viable cells is not as straightforward. Viable cells {{can be defined as}} culturable, metabolically active and intact cells. Culturable cells can be assessed by colony-forming unit (CFU) assay. Metabolically active and intact cells have been quantified by e. g. qPCR, dielectric spectroscopy probes, and flow cytometry using various dyes. All these methods work well for applications in clear liquid media, but have not been validated in 2 nd generation bioprocesses using lignocellulosic materials. In this study we evaluate the applicability of several methods for quantitative assessment of both total and viable cell concentrations in lignocellulosic media. In order to mimic typical conditions of lignocellulosic fermentations, we used a central composite design of experiments with known cell numbers, water insoluble solids content (WIS) and osmolality as factors. For the osmolality, we used sorbitol and NaCl to differentiate hyperosmotic conditions at different ion strengths and conductivities. The cell concentrations were determined using cell enumeration in a hemocytometer (with and without methylene blue staining), plating and enumeration of CFU, qPCR on extracted DNA and RNA, and on-line permittivity using a capacitance probe. These methods have the potential to be less affected by impurities and water insoluble solids in lignocellulosic media than e. g. dry weight and turbidity. The number and viability of cells used to create the test conditions of the experimental design were first determined from the seed culture on defined mineral medium. Considering all experimental points and some validation points within the design space, all the selected methods were used for measuring total and viable number of cells. With these data we built a quantitative model to fit all interaction effects and curvature, and to calibrate the qPCR and permittivity results to the number of total and culturable cell counts. Data of qPCR on DNA were fitted to total cell numbers, WIS level and osmolality. The permittivity measured by the dielectric probe was fitted to CFUs, WIS level, osmolality and measured conductivity. Parameter optimization resulted in statistically significant models with good predictive capacity. The results showed that cell counts and CFU were not sensitive to WIS and osmolarity levels. Therefore they can be used as reference methods in lignocellulose-based media. Furthermore, using the selected methodologies in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process of pre-treated wheat straw showed consistent results in total and viable cell numbers. Development of reliable and validated total and viable cell quantification methods will contribute to wellmonitored lignocellulosic fermentation processes both for research and industry in bio-based production...|$|E
40|$|Tailings are a {{fine-grained}} {{waste product}} produced during the metal recovery process. Tailings consist mostly of different silicates but also sulfides (e. g. pyrite), since 100 % metal recovery is not possible. Freshly processed tailings are deposited in large impoundments. If the mine tailings in the impoundments {{are exposed to}} water and oxygen, the sulfides will oxidize and release acidity and metals such as Fe, Cu, Zn, and Pb. The sulfide mineral oxidation reactions are catalyzed by sulfur and iron oxidizing bacteria (principally Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans) that oxidize ferrous iron to ferric iron, which then oxidizes pyrite. When the leachate produced by this process discharges from the impoundment, it is called acid mine drainage, which {{may lead to the}} pollution of adjacent streams and lakes. The intention with this thesis is to investigate and quantify mineral weathering processes and element release rates occurring in water-saturated and soil-covered sulfidic mine tailings. The study was performed in different batch and column experiments in room temperature and in the laboratory. The batch experiments were conducted for ca. three months and investigated: a) microbial and abiotic sulfide oxidation in freshly processed tailings under oxic conditions at pH 2 - 3 and pH 8, b) microbial oxidation of pure pyrite grains at pH 2 - 3 under different oxygen concentrations ranging from anoxic to oxic conditions. The column experiments, consisting of unoxidized tailings in water-saturated columns, were conducted for up to three years. In these experiments, an oxygen-saturated solution was continually pumped into the column inlet, and investigated: a) differences in oxidation rates between tailings of two different grain sizes, b) factors affecting element discharge rates, acid neutralization, and sulfide oxidation, c) the effect of ions released in a soil cover on release rates in the tailings. Sulfide oxidation processes within the batch experiments were limited by surface kinetics. The microbial oxidation of pure pyrite at atmospheric conditions produced the most rapid rate, while the microbial oxidation of pure pyrite at anoxic conditions was slower by 1. 8 orders of magnitude. Microbial and abiotic oxidation of pyrite in freshly-processed tailings resulted in pyrite oxidation rates that were intermediate between these two extremes. The results from the microbial experiments with pure pyrite indicated a positive correlation between the concentration of dissolved oxygen, ferric iron and bacterial cells (at a <b>total</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentration</b> > 106 cells/mL and a dissolved oxygen concentration ≥ 13. 2 µM), which implies an interdependence of these factors. The results from these batch experiments support the indirect mechanism for microbial oxidation by the ferric oxidation pathway. Pyrite oxidation rates estimated from the batch experiments may be comparable with oxidation rates in the unsaturated zone and at the groundwater table in a tailings impoundment. Acid neutralization reactions in the column experiments resulted in the release of base cations to the column leachate. Calcite was the most important neutralizing mineral despite that it was only present in minor amounts in the tailings. It was confirmed that acidity forced the calcite dissolution. Element release rates in the column experiments were controlled by the availability of dissolved oxygen, which was a function of the water flow rate into the column. These column experiments also showed that the results are comparable with results from field studies, justifying the use of column experiments to study processes within tailings impoundments...|$|E

40|$|The {{overgrowth}} of Gordonia amarae-like {{bacteria in}} the mixed liquor of an incompletely nitrifying water reclamation plant was inversely correlated with temperature (r 0. 78; P< 0. 005) and positively correlated with the solids retention time (SRT) ob-tained a week prior to sampling (r 0. 67; P< 0. 005). Drops followed by spikes in the food-to-mass ratio (0. 18 to 0. 52) and bio-chemical oxygen demand concentrations in primary effluent (94 to 298 mg liter 1) occurred at the initiation of G. amarae-like bacterial growth. The total bacterial concentration did not increase as concentrations of G. amarae-like <b>cells</b> increased, but <b>total</b> bacterial <b>cell</b> <b>concentrations</b> fluctuated {{in a manner similar}} to that of G. amarae-like {{bacteria in the}} pseudo-steady state. The ammonium ion removal rate (percent) was inversely related to G. amarae-like <b>cell</b> <b>concentrations</b> during accelerated growth and washout phases. The dissolved oxygen concentration decreased as the G. amarae-like <b>cell</b> <b>concentration</b> decreased. The con-centrations of G. amarae-like cells peaked (2. 47 109 cells liter 1) approximately 1. 5 months prior to foaming. Foaming oc-curred during the late pseudo-steady-state phase, when temperature declines reversed. These findings suggested that tempera-ture changes triggered operational and physicochemical changes favorable to the growth of G. amarae-like bacteria. Fine-scale quantitative PCR (qPCR) monitoring at weekly intervals allowed a better understanding of the factors affecting this organism and indicated that frequent sampling was required to obtain statistical significance with factors changing as the concentration...|$|R

40|$|Biological {{stability}} {{of drinking water}} implies that the <b>concentration</b> of bacterial <b>cells</b> and composition of the microbial community should not change during distribution. In this study, we used a multi-parametric approach that encompasses different aspects of microbial water quality including microbial growth potential, microbial abundance, and microbial community composition, to monitor biological stability in drinking water of the non-chlorinated distribution system of Zürich. Drinking water was collected directly after treatment from the reservoir and in the network at several locations with varied average hydraulic retention times (6 - 52 h) {{over a period of}} four months, with a single repetition two years later. <b>Total</b> <b>cell</b> <b>concentrations</b> (TCC) measured with flow cytometry remained remarkably stable at 9. 5 (± 0. 6) × 104 cells/ml from water in the reservoir throughout most of the distribution network, and during the whole time period. Conventional microbial methods like heterotrophic plate counts, the concentration of adenosine tri-phosphate, total organic carbon and assimilable organic carbon remained also constant. Samples taken two years apart showed more than 80 % similarity for the microbial communities analysed with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 454 pyrosequencing. Only the two sampling locations with the longest water retention times were the exceptions and, sofar for unknown reasons, recorded a slight but significantly higher TCC (1. 3 (± 0. 1) × 105 cells/ml) compared to the other locations. This small change in microbial abundance detected by flow cytometry was also clearly observed in a shift in the microbial community profiles to a higher abundance of members from the Comamonadaceae (60 % vs. 2 % at other locations). Conventional microbial detection methods were not able to detect changes as observed with flow cytometric cell counts and microbial community analysis. Our findings demonstrate that the multi-parametric approach used provides a powerful and sensitive tool to assess and evaluate biological stability and microbial processes in drinking water distribution systems. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the clinical utility of nasal lavage (NL), we performed post-work shift NL on 172 grain workers and 78 postal worker control subjects. The grain worker group included {{a higher percentage}} of current smokers (25. 7 % vs 16. 7 %) and a lower percentage of former smokers (21. 15 % vs 35. 9 %) compared with the postal workers. The control subjects included more female workers and were slightly older than the grain workers. Compared with the postal workers, the grain workers were exposed to significantly greater concentrations of total dust (0. 1 +/- 0. 0 vs 6. 8 +/- 1. 4 mg/m 3; mean +/- SEM) and total endotoxin (4. 3 +/- 0. 8 vs 2, 372. 4 +/- 653. 8 endotoxin units/m 3). NL from gain workers showed a higher <b>concentration</b> of <b>total</b> <b>cells</b> (55, 000 +/- 14, 000 vs 25, 000 +/- 5, 000 cells per milliliter; p= 0. 03), a higher concentration of squamous epithelial cells (17, 029. 0 +/- 4, 177. 0 vs 7, 103. 7 +/- 1, 479. 8 cells per milliliter; p= 0. 03), and a higher concentration of neutrophils (40, 058. 0 +/- 12, 803. 2 vs 17, 891. 0 +/- 3, 822. 3 cells per milliliter; p= 0. 10) compared with postal workers. Importantly, these differences in NL cellularity between grain workers and postal workers were observed within the three strata of smokers. To further assess the importance of <b>total</b> <b>cells,</b> squamous epithelial cells, and neutrophils in the NL fluid of grain workers, we investigated the relationship between these <b>cell</b> <b>concentrations</b> and (1) measures of dust and endotoxin exposure during the work shift. (2) spirometric measures of airflow obtained immediately before the NL, and (3) work-related respiratory symptoms. The <b>concentration</b> of <b>total</b> <b>cells,</b> the <b>concentration</b> of squamous epithelial <b>cells,</b> or the <b>concentration</b> of neutrophils in the NL was not associated with ambient levels of dust or endotoxin, with baseline or cross-shift changes in lung function, or with work-related respiratory symptoms. These findings suggest that increased NL cellularity may be seen in workers exposed to high dust levels. However, the NL cellularity {{does not appear to be}} associated with ambient concentrations of dusts or endotoxins, with signs of airflow obstruction, or with work-related respiratory symptoms...|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} of flow cytometry (FCM) and 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing data was investigated {{for the purpose}} of monitoring and characterizing microbial changes in drinking water distribution systems. High frequency sampling (5 min intervals for 1 h) was performed at the outlet of a treatment plant and at one location in the full-scale distribution network. In total, 52 bulk water samples were analysed with FCM, pyrosequencing and conventional methods (adenosine-triphosphate, ATP; heterotrophic plate count, HPC). FCM and pyrosequencing results individually showed that changes in the microbial community occurred in the water distribution system, which was not detected with conventional monitoring. FCM data showed an increase in the <b>total</b> bacterial <b>cell</b> <b>concentrations</b> (from 345 ± 15 × 103 to 425 ± 35 × 103 cellsmL- 1) and in the percentage of intact bacterial cells (from 39 ± 3. 5 % to 53 ± 4. 4 %) during water distribution. This shift was also observed in the FCM fluorescence fingerprints, which are characteristic of each water sample. A similar shift was detected in the microbial community composition as characterized with pyrosequencing, showing that FCM and genetic fingerprints are congruent. FCM and pyrosequencing data were subsequently combined for the calculation of <b>cell</b> <b>concentration</b> changes for each bacterial phylum. The results revealed an increase in <b>cell</b> <b>concentrations</b> of specific bacterial phyla (e. g., Proteobacteria), along with a decrease in other phyla (e. g., Actinobacteria), which could not be concluded from the two methods individually. The {{combination of}} FCM and pyrosequencing methods is a promising approach for future drinking water quality monitoring and for advanced studies on drinking water distribution pipeline ecology. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

This increased oxidative activity of the neutrophile can stimulate resistance to infections by stimulating the killing capacity (bactericidie) of the neutrophils.

Cholesterol depletion caused a decrease in the diffusion coefficients for the MHC II proteins and also for a slow fraction of the Tritc-DHPE population. At 37 °C, reduction of the <b>total</b> <b>cell</b> cholesterol <b>concentration</b> results in a smaller suppression of the translational diffusion for I-Ek proteins (twofold) than was observed in earlier work at 22 °C (five sevenfold) Vrljic, M., S. Y. Nishimura, W. E. Moerner, and H. M. McConnell. 2005. Biophys. J. 88 : 334 – 347. At 37 °C, the diffusion of both I-Ek proteins is Brownian (0. 9 <α-parameter< 1. 1). More than 99 % of the protein population diffuses homogeneously when imaged at 65 frames per s. As the temperature is raised from 22 °C to 42 °C, a change in activation energy is seen at ∼ 35 °C in the Arrhenius plots. Cytoskeletal effects appear to be minimal.
