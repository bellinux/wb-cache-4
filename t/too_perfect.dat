The two have been dating and, although Ann really likes Chris, she fears he is <b>too</b> <b>perfect.</b> However, because the extremely health-conscious Chris has a poor immune system and nearly no body fat, he suffers a complete physical breakdown, which makes Ann feel less intimidated about dating him. Meanwhile, Leslie escapes the hospital and heads back to city hall to deliver the presentation herself. Tom returns from the spa, revealing his spa friends are the owners of several car dealerships, which have agreed to lend vehicles to the festival. Although delirious with fever and an excess of flu medication, Leslie delivers a flawless presentation, wildly impressing Ben. She is immediately brought back to the hospital, where Ben tells her 110 businesses have agreed to help with the festival, surpassing the minimum 80 needed.|$|E

Michael French of Pocket Gamer concluded: [...] "You can't escape the fact it doesn't exactly fit on mobile.

[...] Levine was critical of [...] "Homeless" [...] in general, but praised some of its compositional elements. Although {{he thought that the}} song was [...] "almost unbearably bleak", Levine praised the long note which Lewis sustains during the bridge, and wrote that [...] "the 12-second 'eeeeeeyeeaayaaaaay' that jump-starts the crescendo of 'Homeless' {{is one of the most}} dazzling pop moments of the year." [...] Kitty Empire for The Guardian wrote, [...] "Lewis' voice is impressively elastic throughout but lacks any grit or style.

500|$|The dog {{has been}} {{neglected}} or treated unfavorably {{by the family}} in some episodes. In [...] "Dog of Death" [...] (season three, 1992), he nearly dies of bloat and they decide to make budget cuts {{in order to pay}} for the required operation. Although the dog's life is saved, the family begins to feel the strain of their sacrifices and starts treating him badly, causing him to run away. He ends up in the possession of Mr. Burns, who trains him to become a vicious attack dog. Several days later, Bart stumbles upon the trained Santa's Little Helper and is attacked, but the greyhound eventually recognizes his old friend and stops. In [...] "The Canine Mutiny" [...] (season eight, 1997), Bart uses a fake charge card to buy a well-trained rough collie named Laddie from a mail-order catalog. Laddie learns many tricks that Santa's Little Helper is completely unable to perform, and the Simpson family nearly forgets about their old pet. Bart eventually gives Santa's Little Helper away instead of Laddie when repo men take back everything he fraudulently purchased. Feeling guilty about this disloyalty and bored with his <b>too</b> <b>perfect</b> new dog, Bart tries to get him back.

[...] She also said that she did not intend for the album's sound to be commercially appealing: [...] "There's too much pressure to have hits these days.

During Beyoncé's performance of [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] at a concert in Toronto on August 25, 2007, she had a wardrobe malfunction as her dress flew over her head and was speculated to reveal her breast. However, a spokesperson for the singer denied speculations saying, [...] "She's wearing a flesh-tone bra! Do you really think Beyoncé would go onstage like that?". The video which was uploaded to YouTube went viral. Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times discussed about the malfunction, saying: [...] "As a pop queen, Beyoncé is almost <b>too</b> <b>perfect...</b> 'wardrobe malfunction' in Toronto garnered far more attention than was warranted partly because these mistakes contradicted her fiercely athletic style." [...] During the I Am... World Tour, Beyoncé did not perform the whole song; she sang several of the opening lines of [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] after her entrance on stage. During the revue I Am...

500|$|The song has {{received}} generally positive reviews from most music critics.

[...] Lansky also praised it, naming it [...] "another exceptional offering from Unorthodox Jukebox, which {{is shaping up}} {{to be one of the}} year’s best pop releases." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Pop Dust gave the song a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting that 'When I Was Your Man' is [...] "a much more satisfying, less ostentatious ballad than 'Young Girls'— though maybe the lyrics are a little too clichéd to result in a classic soul ballad the way Bruno seems to be going for." [...] However, he praised Mars, which according to him, [...] "nobody puts a song like this over quite like him, and when he hits the big high note on the song’s bridge, it’s about as striking a moment as you’re likely to hear on a pop record this year. It might be a little <b>too</b> <b>perfect</b> to be as devastating as a song like 'Someone Like You', but it might be a big hit just the same, and it’s guaranteed to absolutely slay in a live set." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly was positive, writing that [...] "Old-school charm still gets Mars the furthest, and the best thing here is the classic torch song 'When I Was Your Man', which finds him at the piano listing all the ways he wronged an ex. 'Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life,' he cries in his Sinatra-smooth tenor, oozing charm. Maybe he's a jerk. But he's the jerk that girl's going home with tonight." ...|$|E
500|$|Esther has {{a romantic}} {{interest}} in Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer), who she idealises {{and looks up}} to. Despite her feelings, Rex {{does not appear to}} notice or reciprocate, actress Alexa Havins conjectures that [...] "he's so blind to her feelings" [...] due to him having [...] "this wall built up around him that it's hard to break through." [...] Phifer commented that Rex sees Esther as a sister and conjectures that Esther's interests in him are partly a result of her sensationalising his work. Despite her highly romanticised idea of field work, Esther is not as skilled in the field as more experienced agents Rex, Jack (John Barrowman) [...] and Gwen. However, being part of a new Torchwood team means that Esther is [...] "ripped away from her desk and thrust into the world of Torchwood on the run." [...] During the later parts of the series the character has to fight physically against the team's enemies. Havins did not receive any training for these sequences, she felt that having been trained in fight sequences would have made Esther [...] "too slick, too trained, <b>too</b> <b>perfect,</b> too in sync {{with the rest of the}} Torchwood crew." [...] Instead of being able to take out her attackers easily, when Esther has to fight for her life it is [...] "raw and brutal" [...] and [...] "almost like a bar-brawl meets a chick-fight". Espenson notes that by the final episode Esther has earned a degree of admiration from Rex through her work for the Torchwood team, which she feels to be because [...] "he just can't fail to see how smart and brave she is." [...] In regards to being killed off Havins states that she knew it was a possibility from the moment she accepted the role due to the danger present in the series and its precedence for killing characters. io9's Charlie Jane Anders observed that the character's death helps serve to illustrate [...] "how hard it is to consign others to death, for the greater good." ...|$|E

After the incident Knowles jokingly asked the audience, not to post the footage on YouTube although she knew they would; several clips were posted on the video-sharing website and went viral. On July 26 YouTube removed many of the clips as they were infringing copyright terms. After an initial removal spree, clips of the incident reappeared on YouTube, and were uploaded to other content-sharing websites such as Dailymotion and eBaum's World. A spokesperson for the singer said she was not injured during the fall, which she described as a [...] "mere spot on an otherwise sensational, flawless show" [...] adding, [...] "Miss Knowles picked herself right up, without missing a beat, showing to all that she is the best." [...] When asked about the fall on CNN, Knowles said that she hit her head and chin and was bruised up. She further noted that she immediately started thinking to get up and continue performing the show harder as an athlete due to the adrenaline she had: [...] "Whenever I do something like that I always perform really, really hard cause it makes me little mad at myself so I just go crazy. So they got a really good show in the end."

Critics and journalists often celebrate the character's [...] "outspoken, womanist views". Blake Green of The Baltimore Sun described the character as [...] "the perfect wife and mother of five who also practiced law and dressed to the nines." [...] Jezebel's Hillary Crosley Coker hailed Clair as a [...] "career-driven matriarch that kicked ass {{at home and at}} work." [...] Writing for Complex, Nikeita Hoyte described Clair as [...] "A hard-ass mom who radiates the beauty of a goddess", while the Chicago Tribune wrote that [...] "Clair was one big beacon of gorgeous in the Huxtable household."

In a retrospective review of The Cosby Show in 2014, Daily Life writer Ruby Hamad highlighted Clair as the [...] "one thing about the show that is as good now as it was then". In terms of the character's best episodes, Joe Reid of The Atlantic cited Clair's unimpressed reaction to her husband allegedly confusing a cherished memory of her with that of an old love interest in the sixth season episode [...] "Isn't It Romantic?" [...] as a personal favorite, specifically lauding Rashad's pronunciation of [...] "tacky barrette" [...] and [...] "her hairpin turn when Cliff's real gift is revealed that shows that next dimension that always pushed Clair {{to the top of the}} heap." [...] Meanwhile, Kevin O'Keefe, writing for the same publication, selected Clair's enraged monologue to Vanessa in season six's [...] "Off to See the Wretched", followed by the character's dismay upon learning that Sondra has decided not to return to law school, as his favorites, enjoying the way in which Clair adopts an [...] "attack mode" [...] in both circumstances. Reviewing the character's conversation about pregnancy and marriage with Denise in season three's [...] "The Shower", Slates Aisha Harris wrote [...] "written realistically and delivered beautifully by Rashad, the moment attains a level of artistry that spot-on TV lessons rarely reach." [...] When the show aired, both middle and upper-class working women responded well to Clair. However, some few reviewers have occasionally accused the character of being <b>too</b> <b>perfect</b> and one-dimensional, while others found her to be too aggressive, outspoken, lacking in maternity and overly controlling towards both her children and husband. Additionally, some feminist critics did not appreciate the fact that Clair rarely struggles with everyday situations that working mothers typically encounter in real life.|$|E
