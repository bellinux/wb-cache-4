5|$|In September 1943, Australian forces {{launched}} {{the first phase}} of Operation Cartwheel, General Douglas MacArthur's advance on the main Japanese base at Rabaul. The operation initially went well. Lae fell on 16 September, and having advanced north along the coast towards the Huon Peninsula, the Australians had the Japanese forces on the back foot. On 22 September, elements of the Australian 9th Division, commanded by Major General George Wootten, landed at Scarlet Beach from where they began <b>to</b> <b>fan</b> <b>out</b> to the south and west to capture Finschhafen and to begin the advance towards Sio, further around the coast on the northern side of the Huon Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 29 April the Soviet 3rd Shock Army crossed the Moltke bridge and started <b>to</b> <b>fan</b> <b>out</b> into the {{surrounding}} streets and buildings. The initial assaults on buildings, including the Ministry of the Interior, were hampered by the lack of supporting artillery. It was not until the damaged bridges were repaired that artillery could be moved up in support. At 04:00 hours, in the Führerbunker, Hitler signed his last will and testament and, shortly afterwards, married Eva Braun. At dawn the Soviets pressed on with their assault in the south-east. After very heavy fighting they managed to capture Gestapo headquarters on Prinz-Albrechtstrasse, but a Waffen-SS counter-attack forced the Soviets to withdraw from the building. To the south-west the 8th Guards Army attacked north across the Landwehr canal into the Tiergarten.|$|E
25|$|After having {{gained control}} of the Donetsk RSA and having {{declared}} the Donetsk People's Republic, pro-Russian groups vowed <b>to</b> <b>fan</b> <b>out</b> and take control of strategic infrastructure across Donetsk Oblast, and demanded that public officials who wished to continue their work swear allegiance to the Republic. By 14 April, pro-Russian separatists had taken control of government buildings in many other cities within the oblast, including Mariupol, Horlivka, Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Yenakiieve, Makiivka, Druzhkivka, and Zhdanivka.|$|E

25|$|At this point, the Egyptians {{began to}} fall into disarray, as some retreated southwards. The rest of the forces {{concentrated}} in the town's police station. The Israelis fired their antitank weapons at the station, with other contingents capturing the rest of Beersheba. The Egyptian soldiers {{at the police station}} eventually surrendered. At 09:15, the Israeli forces reported that the town was under their control. At 09:45 they regrouped and began <b>to</b> <b>fan</b> <b>out,</b> setting up fortifications in various positions around Beersheba.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of 29 April, the 150th and 171st Rifle {{divisions}} started <b>to</b> <b>fan</b> <b>out</b> from the Moltke bridgehead into the surrounding streets and buildings. Initially the Soviets were unable to bring forward artillery, as the combat engineers had not had time to strengthen the bridge or build an alternative. The only form of heavy weaponry available to the assault troops were individual 'Katyusha' rockets lashed to short sections of railway lines. Major-General V. M. Shatilov's 150th Rifle Division had a particularly hard fight, capturing the heavily fortified Ministry of the Interior building. Lacking artillery, the men had to clear it room by room with grenades and sub-machine guns.|$|E
25|$|As Robert E. Lee {{moved his}} Army of Northern Virginia northward in June 1863 through the Shenandoah Valley towards Pennsylvania, {{portions}} of his cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart slipped eastward across {{the path of}} the Union Army of the Potomac. A series of raids in eastern Maryland netted prisoners and supplies, as well as disrupting Federal communications and telegraph lines. However, Stuart was not in position to effectively screen Lee's advance or to provide intelligence on the movements of the Federal army. As Stuart headed north in an effort to link with Lee, Union cavalry commander Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton, riding towards Pennsylvania to the west of Stuart, ordered his divisions <b>to</b> <b>fan</b> <b>out</b> across a wide swath, keeping an eye out for Confederates.|$|E

25|$|On 21 June Greer, {{leading a}} {{reconnaissance}} patrol of about 600 {{men of the}} 43rd and 68th Regiments and 1st Waikato Militia, came upon the 500-strong Māori force labouring on Te Ranga's defences. Knowing any delay would allow his foe to strengthen their defences, Greer chose to launch an immediate attack. He sent back to Te Papa for reinforcements, then deployed his men <b>to</b> <b>fan</b> <b>out</b> and open fire on the pā's outposts and trenches. As the reinforcements—220 men including cavalry and one Armstrong gun—arrived two hours later, he ordered a charge on Te Ranga. The Māori responded to the ferocity of the advance of British bayonets with double-barrelled guns, but had little time to reload and were forced to fight hand-to-hand with tomahawks. In what became a short climax to the conflict, between 83 and 120 Māori were killed or fatally wounded, half of them with bayonets, and Gate Pā commander Rawiri Puhirake was among them. His death prompted the survivors to flee. Thirteen privates of the 43rd and 68th Regiments {{were killed in the}} battle, and six officers and 33 non-commissioned officers and privates wounded.|$|E
500|$|Two days later, on 17 May, the 57th/60th Infantry Battalion {{began its}} diversionary {{move on the}} left flank, {{crossing}} the Hongorai inland and advancing along the Commando Road with 32 Corsairs and two batteries of artillery in support. Crossing [...] north of the ford, the centre company carried out an attack along the far {{bank of the river}} without its armoured support which had been unable to negotiate the crossing. Nevertheless, shortly before noon they had secured the crossing and began <b>to</b> <b>fan</b> <b>out,</b> carrying out further flanking moves before establishing a firm base to receive supplies and from where it began patrolling operations on 20 May.|$|E

50|$|The spin-spin {{relaxation}} time, {{also called the}} transverse relaxation time, is related to homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening. An inhomogeneous broadening results {{from the fact that}} the different spins experience local magnetic field inhomogeneities (different surroundings) creating a large number of spin packets characterized by a distribution of Δω. As the net magnetization vector precesses, some spin packets slow down due to lower fields and others speed up due to higher fields leading <b>to</b> a <b>fanning</b> <b>out</b> of the magnetization vector that results in the decay of the EPR signal. The other packets contribute to the transverse magnetization decay due to the homogeneous broadening. In this process all the spin in one spin packet experience the same magnetic field and interact with each other that can lead to mutual and random spin flip-flops. These fluctuations contribute <b>to</b> a faster <b>fanning</b> <b>out</b> of the magnetization vector.|$|R

2500|$|As {{currently}} reconstructed, the Sutton Hoo neck {{guard has}} three principal problems. Several fragments of design 5 are placed too {{high on the}} neck guard, which [...] "shows more space below the lengths of transverse fluted strips than above them. The space left below {{is greater than the}} length of the die, while the space above is less than the length of the die." [...] Corrected on the Royal Armouries replica, the configuration should allow for two full impressions of design 5, of equal length, joined vertically at their ends. Furthermore, the lack of fragments from the neck guard leaves open the question of how many vertical strips of design 5 were used. Although seven strips were suggested in the reconstruction, [...] "here is no evidence to indicate that there were seven vertical ornamental strips on the lower portion of the neck-guard, and the suggestion [...] [...] [...] that the number should be cut to five is equally possible." [...] Even if seven is the accurate number, the current reconstruction shows an [...] "implausible inward tilt" [...] by the two strips flanking the central one; straightening the strips [...] "would have the effect of allowing the ornamental strips <b>to</b> <b>fan</b> <b>out</b> naturally, leaving evenly-expanding wedges of plain surface between them." [...] Finally, the neck guard hangs lower on the current reconstruction than it would have when made, for the top of the neck guard originally fitted inside the cap. This leaves the abutting edges of the dexter cheek and neck guards at different levels, and was corrected on the Royal Armouries replica.|$|E

40|$|Fanout routing for Ball Grid Array(BGA) {{packages}} becomes non-trivial {{when the}} I/O pin count increases. When {{the number of}} I/Os gets larger and larger, the number of I/Os we can put on a package may not limited by the available area but sometimes by the ability <b>to</b> <b>fan</b> them <b>out</b> on {{the next level of}} interconnect [...] - the PCB or MCM substrate. This paper presents an efficient algorithm (EVENFANOUT) which generates the optimal uniform distribution of wires. We have found the three cuts that is decisive on the routability of the package using EVENFANOUT. These decisive cuts form the base for design optimization of the package. 1 Introduction Increasing demand for I/O pin-count prompts the packaging industry to look for more space-efficient packaging methods. Ball-grid arrays (BGAs) promise more I/Os in less area. However, some pins (or solder bumps) may not be available for signal I/O because there is not enough room on the substrate <b>to</b> <b>fan</b> the pins <b>out</b> for connection.
