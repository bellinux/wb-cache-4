Only {{the interior of}} this partially buried building has been excavated, allowing visitors to look down into the broch from the surrounding mound.

5|$|Afrasia {{has only}} {{been found in the}} Eocene Pondaung Formation of central Myanmar, a rock unit which has been dated <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 37 million years ago using magnetostratigraphy and fission track dating.

Although many tons of sediments in the area have been {{screened}} for fossils, Afrasia is still known only from four teeth, suggesting that it was a rare species.|$|E

However, at that time, the NBA did not accept players until after their college graduating class had been completed. Therefore, Chamberlain was prohibited from joining the NBA for a year, and decided to play for the Harlem Globetrotters in 1958 for a sum of $50,000 (equal <b>to</b> <b>about</b> $ today).|$|E

5|$|Alternatively {{pig iron}} {{may be made}} into steel (with up <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various {{processes}} {{have been used for}} this, including finery forges, puddling furnaces, Bessemer converters, open hearth furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, and electric arc furnaces. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize {{some or all of the}} carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.|$|E
5|$|Although {{dating from}} 1195 <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 1400, Lichfield Cathedral has an {{interior}} which presents a harmonious appearance, {{much of which}} is due to its having undergone extensive restoration and refurnishing in the 19th century.

It is also frequently found in shrublands, woodlands, agricultural fields, and mangroves, often adjacent to water, such as rivers, streams, rice paddies, and ditches. It may also sometimes be found in villages and suburban areas. It is able to survive in other habitats also.|$|E
5|$|Although its {{evolutionary}} history—what the forerunner to {{the species}} {{was and how}} the close relatives branched off—is not well understood, the painted turtle is common in the fossil record.

Fossils from 15million <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 5million years ago are restricted to the Nebraska-Kansas area, but more recent fossils are gradually more widely distributed.
