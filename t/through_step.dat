40|$|Network based intruders seldom attack {{directly}} {{from their own}} hosts but rather stage their attacks through intermediate “stepping stones ” to conceal their identity and origin. To track down and apprehend those perpetrators behind stepping stones, it is critically important {{to be able to}} correlate connections <b>through</b> <b>stepping</b> stones. Tracing intruders behind stepping stones and correlating intrusion connections <b>through</b> <b>stepping</b> stones are challenging due to various readily available evasive countermeasures by intruders: • Installing and using backdoor relays (i. e. netcat) at intermediate stepping stones to evade logging of normal logins. • Using different types of connections (i. e. TCP, UDP) at different portions of the connection chain <b>through</b> <b>stepping</b> stones to complicate connection matching. • Using encrypted connections (with different keys) across stepping stones to defeat any content based comparison. • Introducing timing perturbation at intermediate stepping stones to counteract timing based correlation of encrypted connections. In this dissertation, we address these challenges in detail and design solutions to them...|$|R
