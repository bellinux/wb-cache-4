5|$|The Arundel Expressway was {{proposed}} {{as early as}} 1956 as a freeway connecting Baltimore and Annapolis to relieve congestion on MD 2. By 1966, the highway was planned to begin at MD 173 at the city limits of Baltimore, intersect a planned cross-Patapsco section of the Baltimore Beltway, follow its current path to Pasadena, then continue paralleling MD 2 south to near U.S. Route 50 (US 50) and US 301. <b>The</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arundel Expressway inside the Beltway was removed from plans in 1967, with the Beltway instead serving to connect the expressway with highways into Baltimore. <b>The</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freeway south of Pasadena was planned to have intermediate interchanges at MD 648 in Severna Park and Jones Station Road (now College Parkway) in Arnold, and a toll plaza {{just south of the}} MD 100 interchange. <b>The</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arundel Expressway south of MD 100 was removed from state plans by 1975. Instead of a BaltimoreAnnapolis freeway following the MD 2 corridor, in June 1979 the Maryland State Highway Administration announced it was constructing the freeway along the MD 3 and MD 178 corridors.|$|E

The tail extends only about 1mm beyond the back margin of the uropatagium (<b>the</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wing membrane between the hindlegs). The calcar, a cartilaginous spur supporting the uropatagium, is slender. With a width around 1.3mm, the penis is narrow, and it lacks a broadened tip (except in one Croatian specimen). The baculum (penis bone) is about 0.5mm long. The short and broad shape of this bone distinguishes M.alcathoe from M.brandtii as well as M.ikonnikovi.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, MT 287 was rerouted again. The highway {{replaced}} MT 34 from Ennis to Twin Bridges, ran concurrently with MT 41 {{to north}} of Silver Star, and replaced S-401 north to US 10 at Whitehall. MT 287 continued east with US 10 to rejoin its previous route west of Three Forks. <b>The</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway between Ennis and the US 10 junction became MT 287A. The next major change came in 1965, when US 287 {{was placed on}} its present course from West Yellowstone to Choteau. The Raynolds Pass road became MT 50 (now MT 87), and MT 287 was removed from its 1961 course south of Ennis and north of Whitehall. The highway's final extension was north from US 10 to I-90 in Whitehall in 1966 when the Interstate Highway was completed through the area. MT 287 attained its current length when it was truncated at Twin Bridges in 1977. <b>The</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway from Silver Star to Whitehall became MT 55.

The north-south portion of the highway, then designated US71 Bypass had been in existence since 1970 and was renumbered to Route 291 between 1970 and 1971.
