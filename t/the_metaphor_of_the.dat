5|$|The {{emotional}} {{story is}} inspired by Maxim Gorky's sentimental novel Mother, which is considered the first socialist realist novel, and a story that Han was familiar with. Myers traces the story's foundation back to anti-Christian stories in rural colonial Korea {{as well as in}} fascist Japan. <b>The</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> villain as a beast, too, is more readily associated with wartime Japanese propaganda than socialist realism. It had, however, featured in the works of early Soviet writers as whose work Han knew, as well as in textual genres not bound by the official socialist realist dogma, such as journalism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 17th century, René Descartes' {{mechanical}} philosophy encouraged the use of <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe as a machine, a concept that would come to characterise the scientific revolution. Between 1650 and 1800, some naturalists, such as Benoît de Maillet, produced theories that maintained that the universe, the Earth, and life, had developed mechanically, without divine guidance. In contrast, most contemporary theories of evolution, such of those of Gottfried Leibniz and Johann Gottfried Herder, regarded evolution as a fundamentally spiritual process. In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertuis veered toward more materialist ground. He wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over the course of many generations, producing races and even new species, a description that anticipated in general terms the concept of natural selection.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{have until}} {{recently}} cited Lodore and Falkner {{as evidence of}} increasing conservatism in Mary Shelley's later works. In 1984, Mary Poovey influentially identified the retreat of Mary Shelley’s reformist politics into the [...] "separate sphere" [...] of the domestic. Poovey suggested that Mary Shelley wrote Falkner to resolve her conflicted response to her father's combination of libertarian radicalism and stern insistence on social decorum. Mellor largely agreed, arguing that [...] "Mary Shelley grounded her alternative political ideology on <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peaceful, loving, bourgeois family. She thereby implicitly endorsed a conservative vision of gradual evolutionary reform." [...] This vision allowed women {{to participate in the}} public sphere but it inherited the inequalities inherent in the bourgeois family.|$|E

40|$|Analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lexemes telo and put arrives to the {{conclusion}} that <b>the</b> original iconicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lexeme telo “body” (<*tel- “a flat surface, a plank”) represents <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amorphous, unformed substance under a pressure, compressing, or division (a cutting off or separation) and refers to the earth or tree as a form of matter.

500|$|In the 1996 novel The Story of B, {{environmentalist}} author Daniel Quinn {{spends a}} chapter on <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boiling frog, using it to describe human history, population growth and food surplus. [...] Pierce Brosnan's character Harry Dalton mentioned it in the 1997 disaster movie Dante's Peak {{in reference to the}} accumulating warning signs of the volcano's reawakening. Al Gore used a version of the story in a New York Times op ed, in his presentations and the 2006 movie An Inconvenient Truth to describe ignorance about global warming.

500|$|The third quatrain {{continues}} <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nightingale {{and seasonal}} imagery to further {{stress that the}} poet's silence is not because their love is less pleasant. The nightingale {{is used as a}} metaphor to explain that just because he doesn't flatter the Fair Youth, doesn't mean that he loves less. As one scholar put it, [...] "too much praise ceases to please". The poet explains his silence further in line 11, that the wild birds physically burden the tree branches as well as crowd the air with their songs. This may represent the myriad of love sonnets being published in attempt to flatter and please their muses. A similar interpretation of line 12 by Katherine Duncan-Jones is given, in which she claims that the poet is addressing the many circulating love sonnets as somewhat redundant, describes them as [...] "pleasures which have become familiar are no longer intensely enjoyable". This is a usage of another common proverb; [...] "Too much familiarity breeds contempt." ...|$|E

Steinberg had stated that he could have retired on royalties from the many parodies made of the painting, had they been paid, a motivation for his eventual copyright lawsuit for the Moscow on the Hudson use. Fulford, writing in The National Post, noted that <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world as a suburb of Manhattan was [...] "understood and borrowed" [...] by the whole world. Local artists, especially poster artists, presented similarly compelling depictions of their own provincial perceptions.

500|$|Crane {{drew from}} a variety of sources in order to realistically depict battle. Centurys [...] "Battles and Leaders" [...] series served as direct {{inspiration}} for the novel, and one story in particular (Warren Lee Goss's [...] "Recollections of a Private") contains many parallels to Crane's work. Thomas Beer wrote in his problematic 1923 biography that Crane was challenged by a friend to write The Red Badge of Courage after having announced that he could do better than Émile Zola's La Débâcle. This anecdote, however, has not been substantiated. <b>The</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "red badge of courage" [...] itself may have been inspired by true events; historian Cecil D. Eby, Jr. noted that Union officer Philip Kearny's insisted his troops wear bright red unit insignia patches, which became known as marks of valor and bravery. While the 304th New York Volunteer Infantry is fictional, many strategies and occurrences in the novel echo actual events during the Civil War. Details concerning specific campaigns during the war, especially regarding battle formations and actions during the Battle of Chancellorsville, have been noted by critics.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MCU as [...] "the world's biggest TV show" [...] was {{discussed}} again, {{after the release}} of Captain America: Civil War, by Todd VanDerWerff of Vox, who felt that film in particular highlighted Marvel's success with the model, saying, [...] "Viewed in complete isolation, the plot of Captain America: Civil War makes little to no sense ... when you think about where [...] has been in earlier Marvel films ... his leeriness about being subject to oversight makes a lot more sense." [...] VanDerWerff continued that when thinking about the MCU as a television series, many [...] "common criticisms people tend to level at it take on a new context" [...] such as complaints that the films are formulaic, lack [...] "visual spark", or [...] "shoehorn in story elements" [...] that [...] "are necessary to set up future films", all characteristics that [...] "are fairly typical on television, where a director's influence is much lower than that of the showrunner", in this case, Feige. Comparing the films to the series Game of Thrones specifically, VanDerWerff noted that each solo film checks [...] "in on various characters and their individual side stories, before bringing everyone together in the finale (or, rather, an Avengers film)", with Guardians of the Galaxy being equivalent to the character Daenerys Targaryen—"both separated by long distances from everybody else." [...] He noted that this format was an extension of early [...] "TV-like" [...] film franchises such as Star Wars, as well as the format of the comics upon which the films are based. [...] "I say all of this not to suggest that film franchises resembling TV series is necessarily a good trend", VanDerWerff concluded, [...] "For as much as I generally enjoy the Marvel movies, I'm disheartened by the possibility that their particular form might take over the film industry ... But I also don't think it's {{the end of the world}} if Marvel continues on ... there's a reason TV has stolen so much of the cultural conversation over the past few decades. There's something legitimately exciting about the way the medium tells stories when it's good, and if nothing else, Marvel's success shows the film world could learn from that." ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this paper}} is to investigate, through <b>metaphor</b> analysis, <b>the</b> complex nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work {{undertaken}} by waiters and pursers on-board cruise ships. This is an under-researched field and empirical research has produced some interesting perceptions that these groups of workers have of themselves, of others, and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world in which they work and live. Design/methodology/approach – A total of 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted over the telephone from a sample <b>of</b> international participants. <b>The</b> data were analysed using a metaphor analysis. Findings – There were three clusters of metaphorical illustration found: <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship, <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment, and <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> their occupation. <b>The</b> <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment were split into two sub-clusters. One explored how participants understood the ship's space or work setting, and the second identified the strategies used as participants negotiated their way through their working and social lives. The stories collected from the workers have produced a very different but realistic perspective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> working lives <b>of</b> waiters and pursers. Research limitations/implications – Metaphors can only offer a partial view of a social phenomenon, rather than an all-encompassing view, which are furthermore specific to the research setting. Notably, for half of all participants English was not their first language, and consequently this may have had an impact upon their use <b>of</b> <b>metaphors.</b> Practical implications – This research highlights the socio-employment relationship and complexities of working on cruise ships. In particular, it recognises behavioural learning practices and organisational bureaucratic utilities, which the industry relies upon for managing employees. Originality/value – This study contributes new knowledge in an under-researched context exploring <b>the</b> sociological lives <b>of</b> hospitality cruise ship workers. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> <b>metaphor</b> analysis has provided an interesting and useful route to extend understanding of cruise ship work...|$|R
