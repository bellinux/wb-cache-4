5000|$|There is {{more than}} one {{convention}} (method or nomenclature) for the naming of compounds, which can be confusing for those who are just learning, and inconvenient for those who are well rehearsed in the older ways. For beginners it is best to learn IUPAC nomenclature from a source that is up to date, because this system is constantly being revised. In the above example 4.2.0-bicyclooctane would be written bicyclo4.2.0octane to fit the conventions for IUPAC naming. It has then got room for an additional numerical prefix if there is the need to include details of other attachments to the molecule such as chlorine or a methyl group. Another convention for the naming of compounds is the common name, which is a shorter name and it gives less information about the compound. An example of a common name is <b>terpineol,</b> the name of which can tell us only that it is an alcohol (because the suffix [...] "-ol" [...] is in the name) and it should then have a hydroxy (-OH) group attached to it.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of using <b>terpineol</b> as an octane booster for {{gasoline}} fuel. Unlike ethanol, <b>terpineol</b> is a high energy density biofuel that is unlikely to result in increased volumetric fuel consumption when used in engines. In this study, <b>terpineol</b> is added to non-oxygenated FACE F gasoline (Research Octane Number =  94. 5) in volumetric proportions of 10 %, 20 % and 30 % and tested in a single cylinder spark ignited engine. The performance of <b>terpineol</b> blended fuels are compared against a standard oxygenated EURO V (ethanol blended) gasoline. It was determined that the addition of <b>terpineol</b> to FACE F gasoline enhanced the octane number of the blend, resulting in improved brake thermal efficiency and total fuel consumption. For FACE F +  30 % <b>terpineol,</b> break thermal efficiency was improved by 12. 1 % over FACE F gasoline at full load for maximum brake torque operating point, and similar performance as EURO V gasoline was achieved. Due to its high energy density, total fuel consumption was reduced by 6. 2 % and 9. 7 % with 30 % <b>terpineol</b> in the blend when compared to FACE F gasoline at low and full load conditions, respectively. Gaseous emissions such as total hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emission were reduced by 36. 8 % and 22. 7 % for FACE F +  30 % <b>terpineol</b> compared to FACE F gasoline at full load condition.

40|$|Improving the {{octane number}} of {{gasoline}} {{offers the potential}} of improved engine combustion, as it permits spark timing advancement without engine knock. This study proposes the use of <b>terpineol</b> as an octane booster for gasoline in a spark ignited (SI) engine. <b>Terpineol</b> is a bio-derived oxygenated fuel obtained from pine tree resin, and {{has the advantage of}} higher calorific value than ethanol. The ignition delay time (IDT) of <b>terpineol</b> was first investigated in an ignition quality tester (IQT). The IQT results demonstrated a long ignition delay of 24. 7  ms for <b>terpineol</b> and an estimated research octane number (RON) of 104, which was higher than commercial European (Euro V) gasoline. The octane boosting potential of <b>terpineol</b> was further investigated by blending it with a non-oxygenated gasoline (FACE F), which has a RON (94) lower than Euro V gasoline (RON =  97). The operation of a gasoline direct injection (GDI) SI engine fueled with terpineol-blended FACE F gasoline enabled spark timing advancement and improved engine combustion. The knock intensity of FACE F +  30 % <b>terpineol</b> was lower than FACE F gasoline at both maximum brake torque (MBT) and knock limited spark advance (KLSA) operating points. Increasing proportions of <b>terpineol</b> in the blend caused peak heat release rate, in-cylinder pressure, CA 50, and combustion duration to be closer to those of Euro V gasoline. Furthermore, FACE F +  30 % <b>terpineol</b> displayed improved combustion characteristics when compared to Euro V gasoline. © 201...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the influence and the mechanisms of cineole and <b>terpineol</b> on the in-vitro transdermal delivery of huperzine A from microemulsions, and their potential synergistic effect on the permeation enhancement. The transdermal delivery of huperzine A from microemulsions with different concentrations of cineole and <b>terpineol</b> through the rat abdominal skin was determined by Franz-type diffusion cells. The partition coefficient of huperzine A between the full thickness skin and microemulsion was determined. Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was carried out to analyze the effects of cineole and <b>terpineol</b> on the biophysical properties of the stratum corneum (SC) and the mechanisms of permeation enhancement. These results indicated that cineole and <b>terpineol</b> could synergistically increase the transdermal delivery of huperzine A from microemulsions through increasing the partition and diffusion coefficients of huperzine A. ATR-FTIR studies further validated the synergistic effect and revealed that the enhancing mechanisms were due to increasing the disorderliness and fluidity of SC lipid alkyl chains, disrupting the structure of keratin in SC, and extracting SC lipids. In conclusion, cineole and <b>terpineol,</b> acting synergistically to enhance the transdermal delivery of huperzine A from microemulsions, might provide an alternative permeation enhancer combination for the transdermal delivery of huperzine A...|$|E

The solubility of <b>terpineol</b> increased linearly as the concentration of BCD or HBCD was increased, confirming the 1 : 1 stoichiometry of the complex. The negative value of the enthalpy and of the Gibbs energy demonstrated that the process is exothermic and spontaneous. Since complexation gives more ordered systems, the negative value obtained for the entropy change confirms the encapsulation of <b>terpineol</b> both in HBCD and BCD.

Apparent partitioning coefficients (K-p,K-rxn) were estimated from the GP experiments by including the reaction products. Only under extremely low RH conditions (RH < 5 %) did the values of K-p,K-rxn (similar to 5 x 10 (- 6) m(3) /mu g for limonene and similar to 2 x 10 (- 5) m(3) /mu g for <b>terpineol)</b> substantially exceed the physical partitioning coefficients (K-p = 6. 5 x 10 (- 8) m(3) /mu g for limonene and = 2. 3 x 10 (- 6) m(3) /mu g for <b>terpineol)</b> derived from the absorptive partitioning theory.

Compared with other conditions including VOC concentration and degree of neutralization (by ammonium) of acidic particles, RH is a critical parameter that influences both the reaction mechanisms and the uptake ability (K-p,K-rxn values) of these processes.
