40|$|This {{paper is}} {{designed}} to address the significance of water education. This is aimed at increasing public awareness {{on the importance of}} taking clean and safe water and keeping our bodies clean in order not to be contaminated with water borne-diseases. This paper therefore focuses on concept of water, water education, reasons for water education, water-borne diseases, transmission of water borne diseases, effects of water borne-diseases and the prevention of water borne diseases. When people’s behaviour is changed towards water issues as a result of proper information on water, it {{will go a long way}} to reduce the wide spread of water-borne diseases which kill over <b>two</b> <b>billions</b> of people annually. It was therefore recommended that comprehensive legislative programs should be enacted to protect and improve water quality and protect communities from water pollution thereby preventing water-borne diseases...|$|R

5|$|Nearly <b>two</b> <b>billion</b> {{people in}} the {{developing}} world are deficient in zinc. In children, it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea and contributes to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year. The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea. Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality, especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth. However, zinc supplements should not be administered alone, because many {{in the developing world}} have several deficiencies, and zinc interacts with other micronutrients.|$|E

40|$|The {{presentation}} {{gives an}} overview of recent results upon {{a broad range of}} monolithic integrated circuits for high-speed applications based on III/V device technology. Monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) like low noise amplifiers and down converters at 12 GHz have been successfully demonstrated with MESFET technology. For short range communication systems at 60 GHz, amplifiers and modulators with coplanar transmission lines for matching networks with excellent performance have also been developed. Highest frequency of operation is required for automotive applications, e. g. amplifiers at 76 GHz using special transistor geometries utilizing pulse doped heterostructures and 0. 15 mym mushroom gates. Digital circuits with gate delays below 10 psec are under investigation for signal processing as well as laser driver and transimpedance amplifier for 20 Gbit/s optical data transmission. High speed and precision is required for analog-to-digital-converters as well as digital-to-an alog-converters with sampling rates of more than <b>two</b> <b>billions</b> per second, using low power enhancement/depletion transistors...|$|R

5|$|At {{its height}} {{during the period}} of Ravalomanana's presidency, Tiko {{provided}} direct salaried employment to between 1,000 and 3,000 staff and indirect employment to over 10,000. The group was the largest dairy producer in the country and a leader in the national agribusiness sector. The success of his enterprises made Ravalomanana a wealthy man. In the mandatory self-disclosure of wealth submitted to the High Constitutional Court in 2000 by all presidential candidates, Ravalomanana declared ownership of 27 properties valued at over <b>two</b> <b>billion</b> Malagasy francs. He owned 90 per cent of Tiko Inc., 80 per cent of Tiko Agri and 50 per cent of Tiko Oil Products, a portfolio worth 13.1 billion Malagasy francs, and declared 77 million Malagasy francs in annual revenues.
