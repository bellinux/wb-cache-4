5|$|Because {{of the bad}} weather, the B-17s {{returned}} individually to Mitchel Field. Cousland's Flying Fortress encountered severe hail, damaging all {{the forward}} surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>plane,</b> <b>and</b> ice caused a temporary shutdown of one engine. As a result, Cousland lagged behind the others, landing at 16:30. The next morning the three bombers took off to return to Harrisburg and spotted the Rex passing the Statue of Liberty at 09:30 as it entered New York Harbor.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{contacts}} Flynn, {{telling him}} that anti-venom {{will be ready for}} the passengers when they land. However, Flynn discovers that the cockpit is filled with snakes and Rick is dead. After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on prior flight experience. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the plane to depressurize. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Flynn and Troy take the controls of <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>and</b> Troy reveals that his flight experience was from a video game flight simulator. Despite his lack of real-world experience, after Troy makes an emergency landing, the plane makes it to the terminal. The passengers leave <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>and</b> anti-venom is given to those who need it. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the plane, a final snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to his wearing a ballistic vest. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to Bali and teaches him how to surf.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Occlusal plane {{position}} was analysed cephalometrically in 35 Klinefelter adults (47,XXY) and compared with 60 eugnath control males (46,XY).

5|$|While {{entering}} the landing pattern, crash trucks would {{travel to the}} runway and await landing. This was standard procedure for all Head Start landings. After landing, the crew was interrogated prior to being released, so that maintenance, intelligence, and other crews could be alerted {{to the performance of}} <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>and</b> other items that the crew might have noticed during their flight. After release, they would typically go to the Physical Conditioning room for a steam bath and rubdown.|$|E

5|$|An {{intuitive}} {{understanding of}} X-ray diffraction {{can be obtained}} from the Bragg model of diffraction. In this model, a given reflection is associated with a set of evenly spaced sheets running through the crystal, usually passing through the centers of the atoms of the crystal lattice. The orientation of a particular set of sheets is identified by its three Miller indices (h, k, l), and let their spacing be noted by d. William Lawrence Bragg proposed a model in which the incoming X-rays are scattered specularly (mirror-like) from each plane; from that assumption, X-rays scattered from adjacent planes will combine constructively (constructive interference) when the angle θ between <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>and</b> the X-ray results in a path-length difference that is an integer multiple n of the X-ray wavelength λ.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Octopussy return {{separately}} to India. Bond {{arrives at}} Khan's palace just as Octopussy and her troops have launched {{an assault on}} the grounds. Octopussy attempts to kill Khan, but is captured by Gobinda. While Octopussy's team, led by Magda, overpower Khan's guards, Khan and Gobinda abandon the palace, taking Octopussy as a hostage. Bond pursues them as they attempt to escape in their plane, clinging to the fuselage and disabling the tailplanes. In a struggle with Bond, Gobinda takes a deadly plummet off the roof of <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>and</b> Bond rescues Octopussy from Khan, the pair jumping onto a nearby cliff only seconds before the plane crashes into a mountain, killing Khan. While M and General Gogol discuss the transport of the jewelery, Bond recuperates with Octopussy aboard her private boat in India.|$|E
5|$|Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents {{arrived at}} the airport after the plane landed.

A bomb-defusing robot was first used to board <b>the</b> <b>plane,</b> <b>and</b> the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) interviewed all passengers. Another passenger from the flight was placed in handcuffs after a dog alerted officers to his carry-on luggage; he was searched, and released without charges. For several days following, federal officials denied that this second handcuffing had occurred, they later reversed this position, confirming that a second passenger had been handcuffed.|$|E

40|$|Effect of <b>the</b> {{polishing}} <b>plane</b> vibration on large-size optical workpieces {{in continuous}} polishing is studied.

Influences of different parameters, such as the inclination, rotation speeds of <b>the</b> polishing <b>plane</b> <b>and</b> workpiece, <b>the</b> eccentricity and workpiece radius, on <b>the</b> polishing <b>plane</b> vibration were simulated. The simulations results show that rotation speeds of <b>the</b> polishing <b>plane</b> <b>and</b> workpiece is <b>the</b> most significant factor. The chaotic vibration of <b>the</b> polishing <b>plane</b> increases with increasing rotation speeds differences between <b>the</b> polishing <b>plane</b> <b>and</b> workpiece. When differences are small, periodic ups and downs of <b>the</b> polishing <b>plane</b> occur with <b>the</b> increase of polishing time. Experiments verified the influence of rotation speeds differences on <b>the</b> polishing <b>plane</b> vibration. <b>The</b> vibration affects PV of large-size optical workpieces in continuous polishing...|$|R

5|$|In March 2015, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{received}} {{a request to}} reopen {{the investigation into the}} accident. The request was made by L. J. Coon, a retired pilot from New England who felt that the conclusion of the 1959 investigation was inaccurate. Coon suspected a possible failure of the right rudder, or a problem with the fuel system, as well as a possible improper weight distribution. Coon also argued that Peterson may have tried to land <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>and</b> that his efforts should be recognized. In April 2015, the NTSB declined the request, citing that the evidence presented by Coon was insufficient to merit the reconsideration of the original findings.|$|E
