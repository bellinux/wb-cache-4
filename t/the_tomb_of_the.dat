5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cisterns: this tomb is {{the most}} damaged in the necropolis. It {{consists}} of a double room burial; the earliest, (Q79A), was built at {{the same period of}} <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> princess, and was badly damaged when the tomb was reused, and a dromos was built in the place of Q79A {{toward the end of the}} 17th century BC (leading to the founding of burial Q79B). This was probably the resting place of a king; a club (a symbol of royal power) was discovered in Q79A.|$|E
5|$|In the Pyramid Age, <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{king was}} {{associated}} with a mortuary temple located close to the pyramid. As <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king was hidden, this mortuary temple was located away from the burial, closer to the cultivation facing toward Thebes. These mortuary temples became places visited during the various festivals held in the Theban necropolis. Most notable is the Beautiful festival of the valley, where the sacred barques of Amun-Re, his consort, Mut, and son, Khonsu, left the temple at Karnak in order to visit the funerary temples of deceased kings on the West Bank and their shrines in the Theban Necropolis.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the Giant, the {{earthworks}} {{belong to}} Lord Digby, {{rather than the}} National Trust. Its purpose is unknown, though it {{is thought to be}} the site of maypole dancing. It has been considered to be Roman, or perhaps an Iron-Age burial mound containing <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person represented by the Giant.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the Minister of National Defense {{established}} a jack of the President of the Republic of Poland {{with the purpose}} of flying it on Polish Navy ships while the commander-in-chief is on board. The jack is identical in its design to the former Banner of the Republic of Poland. In 2005, the use of the presidential jack was extended to all branches of the Polish Armed Forces. It was first flown on land during a Constitution Day ceremony at <b>the</b> <b>Tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unknown Soldier in Warsaw on May 3, 2005.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 a {{national}} Victoria Cross and George Cross memorial {{was installed in}} Westminster Abbey close to <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unknown Warrior. Westminster Abbey is a living monument to British history in that it contains monuments and memorials to central figures in British History including Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin and James VI & I. As such it was a significant honour for the VC to be commemorated in Westminster Abbey.|$|E

With {{the aid of}} walking sticks, he stood beside U.S. President Barack Obama during a wreath-laying ceremony at <b>the</b> <b>Tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unknown Soldier. Later that day, Finn was a guest at the White House. It was {{his first visit to}} the White House, and his first time meeting a sitting President.|$|E
5|$|The Nineteenth Dynasty saw {{a further}} {{standardisation}} of tomb layout and decoration. <b>The</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first {{king of the}} dynasty, Ramesses I, was hurriedly finished due {{to the death of}} the king and {{is little more than a}} truncated descending corridor and a burial chamber. However, KV16 has vibrant decoration and still contains the sarcophagus of the king. Its central location makes it one of the more frequently visited tombs. It shows the development of the tomb entrance and passage and of decoration.|$|E
5|$|The first {{ruler of}} the dynasty, Setnakhte, {{actually}} had two tombs constructed for himself. He started excavating the eventual tomb of his son, Ramesses III, but broke into another tomb and abandoned {{it in order to}} usurp and complete <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nineteenth Dynasty female pharaoh, Twosret. Therefore, this tomb has two burial chambers, the later extensions making the tomb one of the largest of the Royal tombs, at over 150 metres.|$|E
30|$|Gebel El-Gurnah {{is located}} some 4  km to <b>the</b> west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River Nile, {{opposite}} to Luxor. The main exposed rock units in Gebel El-Gurnah are the Esna Shale and Thebes limestone formations. <b>The</b> <b>tombs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kings were excavated in the Thebes formations at northern side <b>of</b> Gebel El-Gurnah and <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> queens were excavated {{at the southern}} side (Litherland 2013, Dunn 2014, Wüst and McLane 2000).|$|R

5|$|The module's plot {{revolves}} around <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demilich Acererak. The player characters must battle their way past {{a variety of}} monsters and traps, with {{the ultimate goal of}} destroying Acererak. Tomb of Horrors was considered the third greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by the staff of Dragon in 2004. The module has influenced later Dungeons & Dragons products, and was followed by three other (unrelated) modules in the S-series: S2 White Plume Mountain, S3 Expedition to the Barrier Peaks, and S4 The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{lord of the}} goats: it is {{the largest}} in the necropolis; it {{includes}} two depositional chambers and is reached through a vertical shaft. The occupier of the tomb is not known with certainty, he is called the lord of the goats by archaeologists due to the existence of a throne decorated with bronze goat heads in the tomb. A silver cup that has the name of king Immeya inscribed was found in the tomb making that king the most likely owner of the burial.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> princess: {{dating to}} c. 1800 BC, {{it is the}} oldest and {{smallest}} of the third kingdom tombs found. Excavated in 1978, it contained {{the remains of a}} young woman, hence the naming. The dormos has steps, partially cut in the bedrock and partially paved with stones, leading to the chamber, which was achieved through the enlargement of a natural cave. The tomb is the only one not pillaged; it contained precious jewels and funerary objects.|$|E

5|$|Unas had {{a pyramid}} built {{for himself in}} North Saqqara, between the pyramid of Sekhemkhet and the southwestern corner of the pyramid complex of Djoser, in {{symmetry}} with the pyramid of Userkaf located at the northeastern corner. In the process, workers leveled and covered older tombs located in the area, most notably <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second Dynasty pharaoh Hotepsekhemwy (c. 2890 BC).|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with other}} BBC series {{broadcast}} in the 1960s, Doctor Who is well-represented in surviving episodes. Of the 253 episodes broadcast during the 1960s, 156 still exist – mainly due to copies produced for overseas sales. For example, Seasons 1 and 2, {{the most widely}} sold abroad of the 1960s era, are missing only 9 and 2 episodes, respectively. By contrast, the less well-sold Seasons 4 and 5 respectively have none and two complete serials between them, <b>The</b> <b>Tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cybermen and The Enemy of the World from season five. Doctor Whos popularity and high-profile have also helped to ensure the return of episodes which, for other less well-remembered programmes, might never have occurred.|$|E
5|$|Following the purges and {{subsequent}} recoveries, {{gaps in the}} Doctor Who archive are spread unevenly through its first eleven seasons. Major losses mostly affect First and Second Doctor serials; although two stories are missing just one episode each (The Tenth Planet, Episode 4 and The Web of Fear Episode 3), other stories are lost altogether. Patrick Troughton's era as the Second Doctor is particularly affected; of the fourteen stories comprising his first two seasons, only <b>The</b> <b>Tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cybermen and The Enemy of the World are complete, and these only exist due to telerecordings later returned from Hong Kong and Nigeria, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{relatively}} short driving distance from Shiraz are <b>the</b> ruins <b>of</b> Persepolis, Bishapur, Pasargadae, and Firouzabad. At Naqsh-e Rustam can be found <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Achaemenid kings {{as well as the}} Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, which has been thought to be either a Zoroastrian fire temple or possibly even <b>the</b> true <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> Cyrus <b>the</b> Great.

5|$|Founded as {{a cathedral}} in 597, the {{earliest}} parts are from 1070, completed 1505, except the north west tower of 1834. Canterbury {{is one of}} the biggest cathedrals in England, and seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury. It is famous for the Norman crypt with sculptured capitals, the east end of 1175–84 by William of Sens, the 12th- and 13th-century stained glass, the “supremely beautiful” Perpendicular nave of 1379–1405 by Henry Yevele, the fan vault of the tower of 1505 by John Wastell, <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Prince and the site of the murder of St. Thomas Becket.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{sources say}} that Hua Tuo rarely practiced moxibustion and acupuncture. The first {{mentioning}} of acupuncture in Chinese literature appeared in the Huangdi neijing. Acupuncture needles made of gold were found in <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Han King Liu Sheng (d. 113 BCE). Some stone-carved depictions of acupuncture date to the Eastern Han Era (25–220 CE). Hua Tuo also wrote about the allegedly life-prolonging exercises of calisthenics. In the 2nd-century-BCE medical texts excavated from the Mawangdui, illustrated diagrams of calisthenic positions are accompanied by descriptive titles and captions. Vivienne Lo writes that the modern physical exercises of taijiquan and qigong are derived from Han-era calisthenics.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, {{particularly}} Germany and England, memorials used {{a medieval}} style, reaching {{back to a}} more distant past. Some of these medieval styled memorials were set in existing medieval buildings, fusing older and newer themes. Memorial church windows, for example, could combine medieval and modern features, including armoured knights on horseback, modern weapons-including-tanks and aircraft-and modern national flags. Other memorials deliberately chose medieval themes and symbols, such as <b>the</b> <b>Tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unknown Warrior in Westminster, where {{the language of the}} inscriptions was deliberately archaic, and the tomb itself made from a medieval chest, decorated with a crusader's sword. England's patron saint, Saint George, was a particular popular symbol in British designs, typically shown mounted and wearing armour. The Arthurian Round Table and the medieval crusades proved popular themes in Canadian memorials.|$|E
