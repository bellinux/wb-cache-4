5|$|Lee’s army {{fought a}} series of battles in the Appomattox Campaign against Grant that {{ultimately}} stretched thin his lines of defense. Lee's extended lines were mostly on small sections of <b>thirty</b> <b>miles</b> of strongholds around Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia. His troops ultimately became exhausted defending this line {{because they were too}} thinned out. Grant then took advantage of the situation and launched attacks on this thirty mile long poorly defended front. This ultimately led to the surrender of Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox.|$|E
5|$|Strict Sabbatarianism {{was vital}} to Presbyterian culture. For members of separatist churches, the Sunday {{walk to the}} meeting house, {{sometimes}} as much as <b>thirty</b> <b>miles,</b> marked the intensity of dissent and strict keeping of the Sabbath was a mark of true membership. Fast days were also important, particularly in Seeder culture. They often did not involve actual fasting, but focused on stricter observance of the Sabbath. The established kirk had three a year, but the seeders as many as six.|$|E

Two days later, three American tanks rolled into Villalba after driving <b>thirty</b> <b>miles</b> through enemy territory. Don Calogero climbed aboard and spent the next six days traveling through western Sicily organizing support for the advancing American troops. As General Patton's Third Division moved onward the signs of its dependence on Mafia support were obvious to the local population. The Mafia protected the roads from snipers, arranged enthusiastic welcomes for the advancing troops, and provided guides through the confusing mountain terrain.|$|E

In two days, the attackers advanced about twelve miles, before being repelled by a counter-attack. The royalists admitted about 250 casualties. Next, the Egyptians attacked Sudah, about 100 miles north-west of San'a. They used the unpopularity of the local royalist commander to bribe several local sheiks and occupied the town unopposed. After a month, the sheiks sent delegations to al-Badr soliciting pardons and asking for guns and money with which to fight the Egyptians. Al-Badr sent new forces and managed to regain the surroundings of Sudah, though not the town itself.|$|E

Ultimately, this land was sold along with other Wangunk reservation land in the closing decades of the 18th century, but Pampenum is noted for her resolve and determination in maintaining these lands through the colonial court system.|$|R
