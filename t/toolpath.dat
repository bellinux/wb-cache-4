25|$|A {{method of}} helical {{broaching}} {{was developed in}} the 2010s that shortens the <b>toolpath</b> of tapping. To a casual observer (without slow motion), it looks rather similar to traditional tapping but with faster movement {{into and out of the}} hole. It uses a specific tool geometry and <b>toolpath</b> to position rapidly, broach the thread in a single half-turn, and then retract rapidly, shortening the cycle time and consuming less energy. It reduces the cost of threading for any holes that can safely allow the two small fast-helix grooves that it leaves behind along with the thread, which could be true in many applications.|$|E
25|$|STEP-NC can {{exchange}} {{the explicit}} <b>toolpath</b> descriptions in use today, and add part, stock, and fixture geometry, {{a description of}} the tools, geometric dimensions and tolerances, and PDM information. A STEP-NC file is difficult to edit by hand because it contains geometry descriptions but for large programs the file size can be smaller because STEP-NC uses a compressed XML format instead of ASCII codes.|$|E

5000|$|When {{considering}} {{the difference between}} freehand <b>toolpaths</b> and machine-constrained <b>toolpaths,</b> the concepts of accuracy and precision, efficiency, and productivity become important in understanding why the machine-constrained option adds value.|$|R
2500|$|A STEP-NC {{program can}} use {{the full range of}} {{geometric}} constructs from the STEP standard to communicate device-independent <b>toolpaths</b> to the CNC. [...] It can provide CAM operational descriptions and STEP CAD geometry to the CNC so workpieces, stock, fixtures and cutting tool shapes can be visualized and analyzed {{in the context of the}} <b>toolpaths.</b> [...] STEP GD information can also be added to enable quality measurement on the control, and CAM-independent volume removal features may be added to facilitate regeneration and modification of the <b>toolpaths</b> before or during machining for closed loop manufacturing.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{variant of}} form-milling {{involves}} holding the cutter's axis orthogonally (no canting to the thread's helix angle) and feeding the cutter in a <b>toolpath</b> that will generate the thread. The part {{is usually a}} stationary workpiece, such as a boss on a valve body (in external thread milling) or a hole in a plate or block (in internal thread milling). This type of thread milling uses essentially the same concept as contouring with an endmill or ball-nose mill, but the cutter and <b>toolpath</b> are arranged specifically to define the [...] "contour" [...] of a thread. The <b>toolpath</b> is achieved either using helical interpolation (which is circular interpolation in one plane [...] with simultaneous linear interpolation along a third axis the CNC control model must be one that supports using the third axis) or a simulation of it using extremely small increments of 3-axes linear interpolation (which is not practical to program manually but can be programmed easily with CAD/CAM software). The cutter geometry reflects the thread pitch but not its lead; the lead (thread helix angle) {{is determined by the}} <b>toolpath.</b> Tapered threads can be cut either with a tapered multiple-form cutter that completes the thread in one revolution using helical interpolation, or with a straight or tapered cutter (of single- or multiple-form) whose <b>toolpath</b> is one or more revolutions but cannot use helical interpolation and must use CAD/CAM software to generate a contour-like simulation of helical interpolation.|$|E
2500|$|Threads may be milled with a {{rotating}} milling cutter if the correct helical <b>toolpath</b> can be arranged. This was formerly arranged mechanically, {{and it was}} suitable for mass-production work although uncommon in job-shop work. With the widespread dissemination of affordable, fast, precise CNC, it became much more common, and today internal and external threads are often milled even on work where they would formerly have been cut with taps, die heads, or single-pointing. Some advantages of thread milling, as compared to single-point cutting or taps and dies, are faster cycle times, less tool breakage, and that a left- or right-hand thread can be created with the same tool. Additionally, for large, awkward workpieces (such as a fire hydrant casting), it is simply easier to let the workpiece sit stationary on a table while all needed machining operations are performed on it with rotating tools, as opposed to rigging it up for rotation around the axis of each set of threads (that is, for the [...] "arms" [...] and [...] "mouth" [...] of the hydrant).|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} with {{other types of}} High Speed Machining <b>toolpaths,</b> VoluMill <b>toolpaths</b> are typically run at axial depths of cut up to the full flute length of the Milling cutter. But they are also effective in high speed shallow-axial, deep-radial cutting; a stepover between passes of up to 100% of the flat of the tool can be safely used without leaving any uncut material.|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of CAD/CAM, {{predefined}} parametric surfaces are often subject to the operation of trimming or extending. In such a case, the original iso-parametric curves are no longer boundary-conformed. Consequently, they are not anymore suitable for being used as natural CNC <b>toolpaths.</b> In this paper a method to regenerate boundary-conformed iso-parametric <b>toolpaths</b> on altered free-form surfaces is presented. The main idea of this method is to fit the 2 D parametric domain of the given trimmed surface with a 2 D Coons patch. Then boundary-conformed <b>toolpaths</b> on the altered surface can be regenerated naturally via the iso-parametric curves of the Coons patch via a two-step mapping. The application of this method is successfully illustrated on a typical trimmed surface, a turbine blade. The applicability and limitations of this method are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|Pencil milling is {{a cleanup}} <b>toolpath</b> {{generated}} by computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) programs to machine internal corners and fillets with smaller radius tools {{to remove the}} remaining material that are inaccessible with larger tools used for previous roughing, semi-finishing, and finishing toolpaths.

50|$|Abstractly {{programmable}} <b>toolpath</b> guidance {{began with}} mechanical solutions, {{such as in}} musical box cams and Jacquard looms. The convergence of programmable mechanical control with machine tool <b>toolpath</b> control was delayed many decades, {{in part because the}} programmable control methods of musical boxes and looms lacked the rigidity for machine tool toolpaths. Later, electromechanical solutions (such as servos) and soon electronic solutions (including computers) were added, leading to numerical control and computer numerical control.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a multi-material virtual prototyping (MMVP) system, which integrates virtual reality (VR) and layered manufacturing (LM) for digital fabrication of multi-material prototypes to facilitate advanced product development and biomedical engineering. The MMVP system incorporates a topological hierarchy-sorting algorithm, two algorithms for sequential and concurrent multi-toolpath planning, a build-time estimation algorithm, and a virtual prototyping system. Based on the topological hierarchy of slice contours, the sequential multi-toolpath planning algorithm generates sequential <b>toolpaths</b> that avoid redundant tool movements, while the concurrent multi-toolpath planning algorithm generates collision-free concurrent <b>toolpaths</b> to further reduce the build-time. To verify the resulting <b>toolpaths</b> and to facilitate estimation of fabrication cost, a mathematical model is incorporated for build-time estimation of multi-material fused deposition processes. The MMVP system is useful for planning, stereoscopic simulation, build-time estimation and validation of multi-toolpaths, and subsequent digital fabrication and analysis of multi-material prototypes. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|A {{method for}} rapid {{computer}} numerically controlled (CNC) machining is being developed {{in an effort to}} automatically create functional prototypes and parts in a wide array of materials. The method uses a plurality of simple two-and-a-half-dimensional (21 / 2 -D) <b>toolpaths</b> from various orientations about an axis of rotation in order to machine the entire surface of a part without refixturing. It is our goal to automatically create these <b>toolpaths</b> for machining and eliminate the complex planning traditionally associated with CNC machining. In this paper, we consider a problem that arises in automating this process - visibility to the surface of a model that is rotated about a fourth axis. Our approach involves slicing the computer-aided design (CAD) model orthogonal to the axis of rotation. The slice geometry is used to calculate two-dimensional visibility maps for the set of polygons on each slice plane. The visibility data provides critical information for determining the minimum number and orientation of 21 / 2 -D <b>toolpaths</b> required to machine the entire surface of a part...|$|R
