25|$|Habituation – This is {{a process}} in which the brain learns to ignore repetitive, {{meaningless}} stimuli while remaining sensitive to others. A good example of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who can sleep through loud traffic in a large city, but is awakened promptly due to the sound of an alarm or crying baby. Reticular formation nuclei that modulate activity of the cerebral cortex are part of the ascending reticular activating system.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Bethune-Cookman University {{celebrated its}} {{hundredth}} anniversary from its founding {{as a primary}} school. The former 2nd Avenue {{on one side of}} the university was renamed Mary Mcleod Bethune Boulevard. The university's website says, [...] "the vision of the founder remains in full view over one-hundred years later. The institution prevails in order that others might improve their heads, hearts, and hands." [...] The university's vice president recalled her legacy: [...] "During Mrs. Bethune's time, this was the only place in the city of Daytona Beach where Whites and Blacks could sit in the same room and enjoy what she called 'gems from students'—their recitations and songs. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who was able to bring Black people and White together." ...|$|E
50|$|Religious {{corporations}} {{are permitted to}} designate a person {{to act in the}} capacity of corporation sole. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who acts as the official holder of title on property, etcetera.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} some viewed {{the people of}} Sodom as {{embracing}} a philosophy of [...] "what's mine is mine." [...] The Mishnah taught that there are four types of people: (1) One who says: [...] "What's mine is mine, and what's yours <b>is</b> yours"; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> neutral type, some say <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the type of Sodom. (2) One who says: [...] "What's mine is yours, and what's yours <b>is</b> mine"; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> unlearned <b>person.</b> (3) One who says: [...] "What's mine is yours, and what's yours <b>is</b> yours"; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> pious <b>person.</b> And (4) one who says: [...] "What's mine is mine, and what's yours <b>is</b> mine;" [...] <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> wicked <b>person.</b>|$|R
25|$|Another {{explanation}} may be: <b>This</b> <b>is</b> {{the name}} of the author of the wise sayings provided in Prov. 30. Either <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> real <b>person,</b> or as some have suggested, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fanciful name for Solomon. Proverbs 30 says that {{he was the son of}} Jakeh (Hebrew: “Yaqeh”) which means “to obey” or “obedient.” Again, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> either <b>a</b> real <b>person,</b> or another symbolic name for Solomon.|$|R
25|$|Not {{to kidnap}} any person of Israel; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> theft of <b>a</b> <b>person.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Snap-{{decision}} facilitator: Also called [...] "quick decision facilitator", <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> {{charged with}} making {{decisions for the}} group in time-constrained or high-pressure situations. The position is rare and is almost always temporary (contrast with the pre-Imperial Roman concept of a temporary dictator).|$|E
5000|$|Illegal agent: <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who {{is living}} in another country under false {{credentials}} that does not report to a local station. A non official cover operative {{is a type of}} cover used by an intelligence operative and can be dubbed an [...] "Illegal" [...] when working in another country without diplomatic protection.|$|E
50|$|An {{expeditor}} {{is someone}} who facilitates a process. It is a position or role found within project management, construction, purchasing and production control. One example of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> in a restaurant who coordinates actions between cooks and wait staff in a restaurant, managing the flow of orders and giving real-time commands to other employees.|$|E
50|$|At {{least one}} group member should be {{assigned}} {{the role of}} Devil's advocate. <b>This</b> should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> different <b>person</b> for each meeting.|$|R
50|$|Article 144. Whoever {{for sexual}} {{character}} and by force, intimidation or deceit abducts or retains <b>a</b> <b>person</b> shall <b>be</b> punished by imprisonment of four (4) to six (6) years.When {{the victim of}} <b>this</b> crime <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> under eighteen (18) years of age, it is punishable with the penalty prescribed in the preceding paragraph increased by half (1/2).|$|R
2500|$|Possibly in {{retaliation}} for instigating the betrayal and killing of Mathgamain the year before, Ivar {{and two of his}} sons, Amlaíb/Olaf (Cuallaid or [...] "Wild Dog") and Dubcenn ("Dark Head"), were killed, apparently after being surprised, by Brian in 977 on Scattery Island, marking the end of an independent Norse Limerick, which lasted only a surprising fifty five years from the arrival of Tomrair mac Ailchi in 922. At his death in 977, the generally reliable Annals of Inisfallen actually style Ivar rí Gall or simply King of the Foreigners, a fairly rare style otherwise reserved for the Kings of Dublin, thus perhaps lending at least some weight to the claims of the author of the Cogad that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> of special authority in some domain.|$|R
50|$|A {{building}} control officer (BCO, {{also known as}} a building inspector or {{building control}} surveyor) in the United Kingdom. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> with the authority to control building work that is subject to the Building Regulations. The title building control officer is one predominantly used by local authorities in the UK, which confer the title of officer to many of their staff who have regulatory, supervision or enforcement roles.|$|E
50|$|At {{the head}} of the {{procession}} will be a man riding a Phoenix, one legend suggests that this represents a minion of the emperor who grew greedy for power and was hanged from the roof gable for treason. Another version of this figurine is an immortal riding a fenghuang-bird or qilin. Yet another intrepretation is that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> serving the emperor, being watched by the following beasts.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> {{term that}} <b>is</b> used {{often in the}} theory of the Interactional View is enabler. An enabler is within {{addiction}} culture; <b>a</b> <b>person</b> whose non-assertive behavior allows others to continue in their substance abuse. An example of <b>this</b> would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> letting their sibling continue to act in an immature manner because that is what the family is used to him doing.|$|R
500|$|As {{a result}} of his efforts, he is {{considered}} as [...] "one of the greatest wartime heroes". In the foreword to the book The Auschwitz Volunteer: Beyond Bravery, Michael Schudrich, the Chief Rabbi of Poland, wrote as follows: [...] "When God created the human being, God had in mind that we should all be like Captain Witold Pilecki, of blessed memory." [...] In the introduction to that book Norman Davies, a British historian, wrote: [...] "If there <b>was</b> <b>an</b> Allied hero who deserved to be remembered and celebrated, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> with few peers." [...] At the commemoration event of International Holocaust Remembrance Day held in the US Holocaust Memorial Museum on 27 January 2013 Ryszard Schnepf, the Polish Ambassador to the US, described Pilecki as a [...] "diamond among Poland's heroes" [...] and [...] "the highest example of Polish patriotism".|$|R
50|$|Acharyan {{with his}} endless mercy {{performs}} this third Samskaram known as Nama Samskaram. He Acharyan adds DASA {{at the end}} of their names, to signify that he is now the Dasa or servant of Lord Vishnu & Bhagvad Ramanuja through the Acharyan. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> where <b>a</b> <b>person</b> he/she who has other than vishnu names are realloted with Lord Vishnu names.|$|R
5000|$|The image being painted {{here is that}} of a battle-fallen and pain-stricken patriot, {{who becomes}} ecstatic {{following}} the victorious end of the War of Independence. Despite not having a headstone at their final resting place, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> whose mind, body and soul have at long last found peace, and may thus finally ascend and reach the heavens, knowing that their homeland is safe and sound once and for all, and that all their suffering was worth it in the end.|$|E
5000|$|A {{person who}} was born {{as the result of}} an adulterous or incestuous union is limited in whom he or she can marry. The most common case of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who was married halachically but not {{divorced}} halachically. In October 2013, however, the Tzohar law was passed and effectivity ended the monopoly which community Orthodox Rabbis had over weddings and allowed for people of Jewish faith to pick a rabbi of their choosing outside the area which they live, though it still does not account for people who converted to either Conservative and Reform Judaism [...]|$|E
5000|$|Aunty Bainbridge: Appearing in episode one and episode nine, is {{a yellow}} bug-eyed {{person with a}} green shirt who owns many rusty objects (which Salad Fingers strokes) and a small house. While Salad Fingers calls it Aunty Bainbridge in the ninth episode, he also calls it a [...] "young child" [...] in the first, {{indicating}} that he does not, in fact, know it at all. This is further evidenced when it backs away from Salad Fingers {{when he tries to}} hug it in the ninth episode. The only sound it makes is a sharp scream, so it is difficult to tell whether <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> and what its gender is.|$|E
50|$|Built {{during the}} Qajar era, the caravanserai {{is one of}} Persia's best {{preserved}} urban caravanserais. The builder (patron) of <b>this</b> large caravanserai <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> by the name Sa'd al-Saltaneh Isfahani (آقا باقر سعد السلطنه اصفهاني), for whom the caravanserai is named after.|$|R
50|$|A common {{example of}} <b>this</b> would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> {{contracting}} <b>a</b> hit man, or a hired killer. Hit men commit {{the act of}} murder on a specific target or targets, and may receive payment {{in exchange for the}} murder or murders committed. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> what is known as contract killing. Hit men are most often associated with organized crime, e.g., The Mafia, street gangs, and they have also recently been found on the dark web advertising their services.|$|R
50|$|Another form of {{defensive}} behavior in communication <b>is</b> superiority. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> when <b>a</b> <b>person</b> believes {{that they are}} better than the listener and can be shown {{by the way the}} speaker delivers the message. Equality is the contrasting behavior and shows that all people have self-worth. There <b>are</b> times when <b>a</b> speaker may <b>be</b> smarter or be better at something than the listener but speaking to them at the same level is important.|$|R
5000|$|If {{one is in}} {{the process}} of making a {{knowledge}} management solution, creating a metadata schema and developing a system in which metadata is managed are very important. In such a project, a dedicated metadata manager may be appointed in order to maintain adherence to metadata and information management standards. [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who will be responsible for the metadata strategy, and possibly, the implementation. A metadata manager does not need to know about and be involved with everything concerning the solution, but it does help to have an understanding of as much of the process as possible to make sure a relevant schema is developed.|$|E
50|$|A common {{example of}} <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> {{who has a}} {{short-lived}} confused state {{as a result of}} a physical illness such as an infection or a heart attack, but who is refusing assessment or treatment of the underlying condition. It is legal to treat such a physical illness under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act, on the grounds that treatment of the physical illness will alleviate symptoms of the mental disorder. However, this is rarely carried out in practice, given that the mental disorder is likely to be extremely transitory and emergency treatment is often necessary. It is more usual for physical illnesses to be treated under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 where appropriate in these circumstances.|$|E
5000|$|In {{describing}} {{a person or}} machine, idle means the act of nothing or no work (for example: [...] "John Smith is an idle person"). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who spends his days doing nothing {{could be said to}} be [...] "idly passing his days." [...] (For example: Mary has been idle on her instant messenger account for hours.) A computer processor or communication circuit is described as idle when it is not being used by any program, application or message. Similarly, an engine of an automobile may be described as idle when it is running only to sustain its running (not doing any useful work), this is also called the tickover (see idle).|$|E
30|$|In {{this final}} {{hypothesis}} we predict that higher entrepreneurial skills lead <b>a</b> <b>person</b> to have <b>a</b> higher entrepreneur identity aspiration. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> because as <b>a</b> <b>person</b> gets more creative and marshals resources more effectively, he/she {{is more likely}} to aspire to become an entrepreneur in the future.|$|R
50|$|Each hold is {{responsible}} for the discipline of its wrongdoers. Most times the Lord Holder will make the wrongdoer pay restitution and service to the wronged party. The next severest punishment is incarceration. Death penalty can also be used in response to heinous crimes. But the greatest punishment is to <b>be</b> named holdless. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> where <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> stripped of all rank and status and thrown out of the hold. The reason <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the most severe punishment is because the holdless have nowhere to go during Threadfall.|$|R
2500|$|Andronikos {{is first}} {{mentioned}} {{during the siege}} of Corfu {{in the winter of}} 1148/49. The Byzantine forces, led by his father Stephen, were attempting to expel the Normans of the Kingdom of Sicily who held the city. Andronikos' father was killed during the siege in early 1149, dying in his son's arms. [...] The French scholar Rodolphe Guilland erroneously placed Andronikos in partial command of an expedition to Cilicia against Raymond of Poitiers in 1144/45, but the Belgian historian Henri Grégoire determined that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> different <b>person,</b> namely his uncle and namesake Andronikos Kontostephanos.|$|R

50|$|If the {{consequences}} of an attitude consistent act are uncertain, attitude-consistent action {{is not likely to}} occur, {{due to the fact that}} vested interest will be reduced. An example of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who has a negative attitude towards living near a prison. If the person assumes that the link between living near a prison and being a victim of a violent crime is minimal, then health and safety promoting behaviors consistent with this negative attitude are not likely. However, if someone believes that living near the prison and being a victim of a violent crime is almost certain, that person would be unlikely to move close to the prison, assuming the person has a positive attitude toward safety or a negative attitude toward prisons and inmates.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{important}} aspect of his ethics was his insistence upon the need for moral philosophy to be conducted in a theological context. While a Christian could engage in speculative thought about nature or metaphysics in a purely rational manner and develop an adequate philosophy of nature of metaphysics, this is not possible with ethics. Moral philosophy must address the actual state of the human person, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> {{in a state of}} grace. Thus, [...] "moral philosophy adequately considered" [...] must take into account properly theological truths. It would be impossible, for instance, to develop an adequate moral philosophy without giving consideration to properly theological facts such as original sin and the supernatural end of the human person in beatitude. Any moral philosophy that {{does not take into account}} these realities that are only known through faith would be fundamentally incomplete.|$|E
3000|$|... [...]. Links {{have higher}} {{capacity}} when they connect nodes {{of the same}} type. <b>This</b> could <b>be</b> because <b>a</b> <b>person</b> trusts someone, <b>is</b> {{more interested in the}} wellbeing of someone, or is better able to communicate with someone when the two share a type. Call links between nodes of the same type “strong” and links between nodes of different types “weak”.|$|R
50|$|Gravity: The {{effects of}} gravity on venous return seem {{paradoxical}} because when <b>a</b> <b>person</b> stands up, hydrostatic forces cause the right atrial pressure to decrease and the venous {{pressure in the}} dependent limbs to increase. This increases the pressure gradient for venous return from the dependent limbs to the right atrium; however, venous return actually decreases. The reason for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> when <b>a</b> <b>person</b> initially stands, cardiac output and arterial pressure decrease (because right atrial pressure falls). The flow through the entire systemic circulation falls because arterial pressure falls more than right atrial pressure; therefore the pressure gradient driving flow throughout the entire circulatory system is decreased.|$|R
50|$|According to Sabino Metta, a {{behavioral}} psychologist, the phobic reaction <b>is</b> <b>a</b> learned behavior. A common example of <b>this</b> would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> elderly <b>person</b> who hears {{about all of}} their friends suffering from various ailments and pains. This person will begin to anticipate the problems and experience the results before anything actually happens to them. People suffering from this probably have hyperalgesia.|$|R
