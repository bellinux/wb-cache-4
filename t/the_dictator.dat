5|$|<b>The</b> <b>dictator</b> had maius imperium {{and total}} {{authority}} {{to command the}} state, however, since <b>the</b> <b>dictator</b> generally tried to maintain order, this did not conflict with {{the responsibilities of the}} other magistrates, who continued to function during a dictatorship.

5|$|The novelists of <b>the</b> <b>dictator</b> novel genre {{combined}} narrative {{strategies of}} both modern and postmodern writing. Postmodern techniques, constructed {{largely in the}} late 1960s and 1970s, included use of interior monologues, radically stream-of-consciousness narrative, fragmentation, varying narrative points of view, neologisms, innovative narrative strategies, and frequent lack of causality. Alejo Carpentier, a Boom writer and contributor to <b>the</b> <b>dictator</b> novel genre pioneered {{what came to be}} known as magical realism, although the use of this technique is not necessarily a prerequisite of <b>the</b> <b>dictator</b> novel, as there are many that do not utilize magical realism.|$|E

In addition to the threat to Brazil's territorial integrity, Rosas had ambitions to conquer Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia. Brazil's Conservative Cabinet decided to form military alliances with the countries threatened by <b>the</b> <b>dictator.</b> On 4 September 1851, Brazil's army, commanded by Luis Alves de Lima e Silva (then Count of Caxias), crossed the border into Uruguay.|$|E

5|$|To be {{considered}} a dictator novel, a story should have strong political themes drawn from history, a critical examination of the power held by <b>the</b> <b>dictator,</b> the caudillo, and some general reflection {{on the nature of}} authoritarianism. Although some dictator novels centre on one historical dictator (albeit in fictional guise), they do not analyze the economics, politics, and rule of the régime as might a history book. <b>The</b> <b>dictator</b> novel genre includes I, the Supreme (1974), by Augusto Roa Bastos, about Dr. Francia of Paraguay, and The Feast of the Goat (2000), by Mario Vargas Llosa, about Rafael Leónidas Trujillo of the Dominican Republic. Alternatively, the novelist might create a fictional dictator to achieve the same narrative end, as in Reasons of State (1974), by Alejo Carpentier, in which <b>the</b> <b>dictator</b> is a composite man assembled from historical dictators. The genre of <b>the</b> <b>dictator</b> novel has been very influential {{in the development of a}} Latin American literary tradition, because many of the novelists rejected traditional, linear story-telling techniques, and developed narrative styles that blurred the distinctions between reader, narrator, plot, characters, and story. In examining the authority of leadership, the novelists also assessed their own social roles as paternalistic dispensers of wisdom, like that of the caudillo whose régime they challenged in their dictator novels.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} {{extraordinary}} magistrates: <b>the</b> <b>dictator</b> and the magister equitum (literally: master of horse). Dictators were {{selected by the}} consuls to resolve some crisis threatening the republic, for a term of around six months, before {{they were expected to}} resign and return their powers to the ordinary magistrates. The magister equitum, was then appointed by <b>the</b> <b>dictator</b> as his lieutenant. The dictatorship was only used in the early and middle Republic, before falling out of fashion {{after the end of the}} Second Punic War, before being revived during the time of Sulla as an extraconstitutional measure, not to defeat some foe or quell unrest, but rather, to bring stability to the political order.|$|E

5|$|As {{war with}} the British Empire loomed, Brazil had to turn its {{attention}} to its southern frontiers.

Brazil's progressive cabinet decided to intervene and dispatched an army, which invaded Uruguay in December 1864, beginning the brief Uruguayan War. <b>The</b> <b>dictator</b> of nearby Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, took advantage of the Uruguayan situation in late 1864 by attempting to establish his nation as a regional power. In November of that year, he ordered a Brazilian civilian steamship seized, triggering the Paraguayan War, and then invaded Brazil.|$|E

5|$|During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923–1930) and {{especially}} of Francisco Franco (1939–1975), all regional cultures were suppressed. All of the languages spoken in Spanish territory, except Spanish (Castilian) itself, were officially banned. Symbolising the Catalan people's desire for freedom, Barça became 'More than a club' (Més que un club) for the Catalans. According to Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, {{the best way}} for the Catalans to demonstrate their identity was by joining Barça. It was less risky than joining a clandestine anti-Franco movement, and allowed them to express their dissidence. During Franco's regime, however, the blaugrana team was granted profit due to its good relationship with <b>the</b> <b>dictator</b> at management level, even giving two awards to him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} of post-independence Latin America, dictatorships have been {{relatively}} commonexamples range from Paraguay's José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia in the 19th century to Chile's Augusto Pinochet in the 20th. In this context, Latin American literature has been distinguished by the protest novel, or dictator novel; the main story is based around <b>the</b> <b>dictator</b> figure, his behaviour, characteristics and {{the situation of the}} people under his regime. Writers such as Sarmiento used the power of the written word in order to criticize government, using literature as a tool, an instance of resistance and as a weapon against repression.|$|E
5|$|Since the tribunes were {{considered}} to be the embodiment of the plebeians, they were sacrosanct. Their sacrosanctity was enforced by a pledge, taken by the plebeians, to kill any person who harmed or interfered with a tribune during his term of office. All of the powers of the tribune derived from their sacrosanctity. One consequence was that it was considered a capital offense to harm a tribune, to disregard his veto, or to interfere with a tribune. In times of military emergency, a dictator would be appointed for a term of six months. Constitutional government would be dissolved, and <b>the</b> <b>dictator</b> would be the absolute master of the state. When the dictator's term ended, constitutional government would be restored.|$|E
