500|$|In 1981 Daniel Dennett had {{formulated}} another {{argument against}} the LOT. Dennett suggested that it would seem, {{on the basis of}} the evidence of our behavior toward computers but also with regard <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> own unconscious behavior, that explicit representation is not necessary for the explanation of propositional attitudes. During a game of chess with a computer program, we often attribute such attitudes to the computer, saying such things as [...] "It thinks that the queen should be moved to the left." [...] We attribute propositional attitudes to the computer and this helps us to explain and predict its behavior in various contexts. Yet no one would suggest that the computer is actually thinking or believing somewhere inside its circuits the equivalent of the propositional attitude [...] "I believe I can kick this guy's butt" [...] in Mentalese. The same is obviously true, suggests Dennett, of many of our everyday automatic behaviors such as [...] "desiring to breathe clear air" [...] in a stuffy environment.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, several Egyptologists {{point out}} that Roman historians such as Pliny the Elder and Frontinus (both around 70 A.D.) equally do not {{hesitate}} to ridicule the pyramids of Giza: Frontinus calls them [...] "idle pyramids, containing the indispensable structures likewise <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> abandoned aqueducts at Rome" [...] and Pliny describes them as [...] "the idle and foolish ostentation of royal wealth". Egyptologists clearly see politically and socially motivated intentions in these criticisms and it seems paradoxical {{that the use of}} these monuments was forgotten, but the names of their builders remained immortalized.|$|E
2500|$|The {{expedition}} {{spent three}} days {{at the base of}} Pike's Peak to explore the Fontaine qui Bouille (now called Fountain Creek), which allowed the men to bathe before beginning their work, making studies and collecting samples of the local geology. On reaching the actual springs, the men compared the tastes of each spring, created lemon-flavored soda, and bottled pure spring water to later compare with city water. The afternoon of their last day was spent in the Garden of the Gods. The men enjoyed squeezing into a narrow cavern and reaching [...] "a vault about fifty feet long, ten feet high", which they examined by candlelight, and comparing the Garden's rock formations to recognizable shapes, including animals and [...] "a statue of Liberty, standing by her escutcheon, with the usual Phrygian cap on her head." [...] The men were so impressed by the landscape, that [...] "t was a great disappointment <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> kind friends that our artist [...] did not choose the Garden of the Gods for a 'big picture.' It was such an interesting place in nature that they could not understand its unavailability for art." [...] Ludlow later surmised that, [...] "however impressive it might be outdoors, [...] was absolutely incommunicable by paint and canvas".|$|E

2500|$|The small-pox so fatal and so general amongst us is here entirely {{harmless}} by {{the invention}} of ingrafting (which is the term they give it). There {{is a set of}} old women who make it their business to perform the operation. Every autumn in the month of September, when the great heat is abated, people send to one another to know if any of their family has a mind to have the small-pox. They make parties for this purpose, and when they are met (commonly fifteen or sixteen together) the old woman comes with a nutshell full of the matter of the best sort of small-pox and asks what veins you please to have opened. She immediately rips open that you offer to her with a large needle (which gives you no more pain than a common scratch) and puts into the vein as much venom as can lye upon the head of her needle, and after binds up the little wound with a hollow bit of shell, and in this manner opens four or five veins[...] [...] [...] The children or young patients play together {{all the rest of the}} day and are in perfect health till the eighth.
