40|$|Risk taking (RT) and self-harm (SH) are clinically, conceptually, and empiricallyrelated, yet {{separate}} constructs, which occur {{most frequently}} during adolescence. The current study utilized retrospective reports {{of college students}} to determine reported <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> engagement in RT and SH behaviors. Reported ages were compared with predictions for <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> high frequency engagement in RT based on the Dual Systems Model of Adolescent Risk Taking (DSMART; Steinberg, 2010). The sample consisted of 228 college students, {{ranging in age from}} 18 to 48 years (mean 22. 8), who completed a survey of commonly investigated RT (12 items) and SH (18 items) behaviors. A positive correlation between the RT and SH scales supported a relationship between RT and SH, as predicted. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> engagement reported for both RT and SH behaviors were significantly higher than the ages predicted by the DSMART.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the formation of globular cluster (GC) systems in the fiducial semi-analytic galaxy formation model of Cole et al. We assume that GCs are formed at high-redshift (z > 5) in proto-galactic fragments, and during the subsequent gas-rich merging of these fragments. We find that <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metal-rich GCs are dependent upon host galaxy luminosity and halo circular velocity, whereas <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metal-poor GCs are not. We find that gaseous merging of the proto-galactic fragments leads to a significant age-spread amongst the metal-rich GCs, which increases for lower-luminosity galaxies. We find the total GC populations scale with host galaxy luminosity as L^ 1. 25, due to the systematic increase in the mass-to-light ratios (with mass) of the galaxy haloes in the model. A comparison between the luminosity growth of the model ellipticals and their GC formation indicates that mergers do not significantly effect S_N at z < 2. We conclude that gaseous merging, the bulk of which occurs at 1 < z < 4 in the Lambda-CDM model, leads {{to the formation of}} the metal-rich peak of the GC systems of elliptical galaxies. We suggest that the formation and subsequent truncation of the metal-poor GCs is closely related to the star formation rate in the proto-galactic fragments, which may have been significantly higher at early times (abridged) ...|$|R
