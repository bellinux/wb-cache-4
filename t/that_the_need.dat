5|$|From {{national}} hospital admission databases {{it appears}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for neurosurgical intervention for IIH has increased markedly {{over the period}} between 1988 and 2002. This has been attributed {{at least in part}} to the rising prevalence of obesity, although some of this increase may be explained by the increased popularity of shunting over optic nerve sheath fenestration.|$|E
5|$|The NPVIC {{does not}} include any {{provision}} for a nationwide recount {{in the event that}} the vote tally is in dispute. While each state has established rules governing recounts {{in the event of a}} close or disputed statewide tally, it is possible for the national vote to be close without there being a close result in any one state. Proponents of the compact argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for a recount would be less likely under a national popular vote than under the current electoral system.|$|E
5|$|A giant clone of Keniclius, named Keniclius Five, kidnaps First Officer Spock (voiced by Leonard Nimoy). He {{believes}} the galaxy is as war-ravaged as Earth {{was when he}} left it. He plans to enforce peace on the galaxy {{with the aid of}} a fleet of Phylosian ships and a giant clone of Spock that he's created, at the expense of the original Spock's life. The newly awakened giant Spock clone uses his Vulcan telepathic abilities to mind meld with his original self and save his life. The two Spocks, in concert with Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner), convince Keniclius <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for his plan no longer exists. Spock Two and Dr. Keniclius Five devote themselves to restoring the Phylosian civilization as the original departs with his shipmates.|$|E

5|$|While the Japanese {{were able}} to launch 108 {{aircraft}} in just seven minutes, it took Enterprise and Hornet over an hour to launch 117. Spruance judged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to throw something at the enemy {{as soon as possible}} was greater than the need to coordinate the attack by aircraft of different types and speeds (fighters, bombers, and torpedo bombers). Accordingly, American squadrons were launched piecemeal and proceeded to the target in several different groups. It was accepted that the lack of coordination would diminish the impact of the American attacks and increase their casualties, but Spruance calculated that this was worthwhile, since keeping the Japanese under aerial attack impaired their ability to launch a counterstrike (Japanese tactics preferred fully constituted attacks), and he gambled that he would find Nagumo with his flight decks at their most vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|The {{right to}} be identified, known as the right of paternity, applies to the creators of {{original}} literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works; for films, the {{right to be}} identified is granted to the director rather than the writer. Some specific types of work are not protected by this right, particularly those made to report current events, periodicals, newspapers or encyclopaedias. These exceptions were included as a result of lobbying by the publishing industry, and the fear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to name the author of a current events report could interfere with its speedy delivery, and undermine the image of the news as objective and neutral. Under Section 79, {{the right to be}} identified also does not apply to authors of computer programs, computer-generated works, typefaces or works protected by crown copyright. On those works which are covered by this moral right, {{there is a need to}} assert it; this may be done through an instrument assigning copyright, or any other instrument written by the author or director. If the asserting is done through a document designed to assign copyright, it binds the assignee and anyone who claims through him, with or without notice; if it is done through another instrument, it only applies to those who are directly informed of the assertion.|$|E

25|$|Opponents {{also argued}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for the {{expressway}} was not shown in studies. A 1963 transportation study which supported construction, expected {{the population of}} Hamilton to be 785,000 by 1985, while the actual population reached 480,000 by 2001. Employment in the industrial bayfront had dropped and a commuting route between Hamilton Mountain and the bayfront was less necessary.|$|E

Various plans for a direct line bypassing Greenisland had been proposed over the years but the engineering problems faced by having to cross Valentine's Glen near Whiteabbey and surmount Mossley Col had precluded these. However, construction started on such a scheme on 1 January 1931.|$|E
25|$|Tasers {{and other}} {{electronic}} control devices are considered firearms in Sweden and are banned for civilian use. The Swedish police had purchased a limited quantity of Tasers, {{and was about}} to initiate field trials when these were cancelled in 2005 after an ethics commission found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for (and risks of) such devices was not firmly established. The purchased Tasers were then donated to Finland, where field trials were initiated.|$|E

25|$|Other aspects are {{highlighted}} in different theories as of contributing importance. It is sometimes claimed that technological development, religious development, or socialization of members {{are crucial to}} state development. However, most of these factors {{are found to be}} secondary in anthropological analysis. In addition to conquest, some theories contend <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for defense from military conquest or the military organization to conquer other peoples is the key aspect leading to state formation.|$|E
25|$|After NLA {{was founded}} in 1977, it started working to {{establish}} a permanent ambulance helicopter base in the central parts of Eastern Norway. Initially the foundation started fund-raising to run a one-year trial with a helicopter based near Oslo.

25|$|The {{leadership}} was divided {{on how to}} respond to the movement as early as mid-April. After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, the divisions intensified. Those who supported continued dialogue and a soft approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives who opposed the movement rallied behind Premier Li Peng. Zhao and Li clashed at a PSC meeting on 1 May. Li maintained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for stability overrides all else, while Zhao said that the party should show support for increased democracy and transparency. Zhao pushed the case for further dialogue.|$|E

RDR hired a literature professor from the University of California, Berkeley, who cited reference guides to The Lord of the Rings and C.S. Lewis’s The Chronicles of Narnia as precedents to the Lexicon's book. David Hammer, lawyer for RDR, claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for a reference guide was greatest when the work being discussed is most creative, and fantasy is presumably the most creative form of literature.|$|E
25|$|The {{public is}} also quite clear on its {{priorities}} {{when it comes}} to promoting energy conservation versus increasing the supply of oil, coal, and natural gas. When asked which of these should be the higher priority, the public chooses energy conservation by a very wide 68 percent-to-21 percent margin. The public also predominantly believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to cut down on energy consumption and protect the environment means increased energy efficiency should be mandated for certain products. Ninety-two percent of Americans now support such requirements.|$|E
