5|$|In 1984, the French {{government}} made an official investigation, concluding {{that it was}} possible that the aircraft had reached Newfoundland. In 1989, the NBC television series Unsolved Mysteries advanced the theory that the two aviators made it across the ocean, but crashed and perished in the woods of Maine. One of Nungesser's relatives, William Nungesser, made several trips to Maine to search, focusing his energies around <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>slope</b> of Round Lake Hills in Washington County, Maine, as well as the area around Lake Winnipesaukee.|$|E
5|$|The Great Salt Lake is fed {{by three}} major rivers and several minor streams. The three major rivers are each fed {{directly}} or indirectly from the Uinta Mountain range in northeastern Utah. The Bear River starts on <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>slope</b> of the Uintas and flows north past Bear Lake, into which some of Bear River's waters have been diverted via a man-made canal into the lake, but later empty back into the river {{by means of the}} Bear Lake Outlet. The river then turns south in southern Idaho and eventually flows into the northeast arm of the Great Salt Lake. The Weber River also starts on <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>slope</b> of the Uinta Mountains and flows into the east edge of the lake. The Jordan River does not receive its water directly from the Uintas, rather it flows from freshwater Utah Lake, which itself is fed primarily by the Provo River; the Provo River does originate in the Uintas, {{a few miles from the}} Weber and Bear. The Jordan flows from the north part of Utah Lake into the southeast corner of the Great Salt Lake.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{river otter}} is found {{throughout}} North America, inhabiting inland waterways and coastal areas in Canada, the Pacific Northwest, the Atlantic states, and the Gulf of Mexico. River otters also currently inhabit coastal regions throughout the United States and Canada. North American river otters also inhabit the forested {{regions of the}} Pacific coast in North America. The species is also present throughout Alaska, including the Aleutian Islands, and <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>slope</b> of the Brooks Range.|$|E

50|$|Deformation {{outside the}} core has mostly taken {{place on the}} {{southern}} slopes of the mountains; however, there is some deformation on <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>slopes.</b> This deformation is differentiated on <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>slopes</b> from East to West. In the west, some thrusting to <b>the</b> <b>North</b> of <b>the</b> Crest has taken place into the Kuban Basin. When the thrusting die out <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>slopes</b> of <b>the</b> central Greater Caucasus form a basement uplift, forming a monocline dipping <b>North.</b> Dagestan to <b>the</b> Eastern end of the range is the where most thrusting to <b>the</b> <b>North</b> occurs and has formed a folded zone of sediments, overlying some of the Terek Basin.|$|R
5|$|At Valdez, {{construction}} was two-thirds complete by September as 4,200 workers hurried {{to complete the}} marine terminal. Because of loose soil found at the job site, enormous retaining walls had to be constructed to secure the ground below some of the 58 structures that were completed {{by the end of}} the year. During the first week of November, the first ship docked at the newly built Valdez quays. It was not a tanker but a ship bringing more construction material. In December, the first signal was sent from the Valdez operations center—where two new control computers had been installed—to Pump Station 2 on <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Slope.</b>|$|E

25|$|Though a {{pipeline}} from <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Slope</b> {{to the nearest}} ice-free port, almost 800 miles (1,300km) to the south, {{was the only way}} to get Alaska's oil to market, significant engineering challenges lay ahead. Between <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Slope</b> and Valdez, there were active fault lines, three mountain ranges, miles of unstable, boggy ground underlain with frost, and migration paths of caribou and moose. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline was ultimately completed in 1977 at a total cost of $8 billion.|$|E
