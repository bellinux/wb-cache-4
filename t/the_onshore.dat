5|$|Wales {{has some}} {{potential}} for <b>the</b> <b>onshore</b> {{production of oil}} and gas. Shale gas may be obtained by fracking and there is methane in unmined coal seams that may be extractable. Another potential source of gas is the underground controlled combustion of coal seams to produce syngas, a mixture of hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide.|$|E
5|$|The foreign {{exchange}} rules also oblige Icelandic residents to deposit any new foreign currency they receive with an Icelandic bank. There is anecdotal evidence that some Icelandic exporters had been operating an informal offshore {{foreign exchange}} market, trading pounds and euros for krónur outside {{the control of}} any regulator and starving <b>the</b> <b>onshore</b> market of foreign currency. Hence the Central Bank had to sell €124 million of currency reserves in November 2008 {{to make up the}} difference, compared with an estimated trade surplus of €13.9 million.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Jeanne moved inland, its inner eyewall dissipated, and {{its outer}} eyewall quickly became less distinct. It turned west-northwestward over the state, curving around the western {{periphery}} of the ridge to its northeast. By 14hours after landfall, Jeanne weakened to tropical storm status near the Tampa Bay area. In western Florida, offshore winds produced a tide of 4.5feet (1.4m) below normal in Cedar Key; however, after the storm passed the area, <b>the</b> <b>onshore</b> winds produced above normal tides. Despite initial forecasts that it would emerge into the Gulf of Mexico, the storm remained over land and continued to slowly weaken. Early on September 27, dry air became entrained into the southern {{periphery of the}} circulation, which diminished the thunderstorms to the south. After turning northward, Jeanne entered southern Georgia and weakened into a tropical depression.|$|E

5|$|Convinced {{they would}} be killed if the Malagasy {{discovered}} the truth while still on board ship, the crew sealed their messages in bottles and dropped them into <b>the</b> <b>onshore</b> current. The VOC authorities in Cape Town had sent their chief ship's carpenter, Philip van den Berg, with two other ship's carpenters, two pilots, a quartermaster and 20 sailors overland. Carpenters were needed since neither of Meermin boats, now onshore, could be used: one {{was buried in the}} sand, and the other was in need of repair. The party from Cape Town had arrived by 6March, and, while Johannes Le Sueur was overseeing the carpenters' examination of Meermins boats, he was handed a bottle containing a message signed by Jan de Leeuw. A second bottle, containing a message signed by Olof Leij, was also found and handed to Le Sueur, and the fires were lit on 7March. One of the messages is preserved in the Cape Archives Repository.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimate}} of $74 million financial impact {{over three years}} to the county includes approximately $37 million in lost property taxes, $32 million in lessened worker income and $5 million in reduced federal royalties. This {{is the result of}} the region’s oil and gas industry being heavily dependent on Lines 901 and 903. Prior to the spill, Exxon, which was the region’s biggest oil operator at the time, was on pace to generate approximately $636 million in revenue in Santa Barbara County during 2015 but as of November 5, 2015 had only generated an estimated $216.6 million. The offshore oil platforms that rely on the lines were forced to shut down when onshore storage tanks were filled. , no timetable had been established to restart the rigs. Truck transport of continuing production from the offshore platforms was not allowed by local agencies. Exceptions have been closely scrutinized by local officials such as allowing Venoco in August 2015 to transport crude oil that was already onshore by truck for a limited period. The oil had been evacuated from tanks and pipelines to allow maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>onshore</b> Ellwood facility in Goleta that serves Platform Holly.|$|E

By the end of the 19th century skilled workers and specialists flocked to Baku. By 1900 the city had more than 3,000 oil wells, of which 2,000 were producing oil at industrial levels. Baku ranked as one of the largest centres for the production of oil industry equipment before World War II. The World War II Battle of Stalingrad was fought to determine who would have control of the Baku oil fields. Fifty years before the battle, Baku produced half of the world's oil supply.|$|E
25|$|Most {{turbines}} in the European Union produce electricity at {{an average}} of 25% of their rated maximum power due to the variability of wind resources, but Scotland's wind regime provides average capacity factor of 31% or higher on the west and northern coasts. The load factor recorded for <b>the</b> <b>onshore</b> North Rhins windfarm near Stranraer was 40%, which is typical for well-sited mainland windfarms. A small wind farm on Shetland with five Vestas V47 660kW turbines recently achieved a world record of 58% capacity {{over the course of a}} year. This record is claimed by Burradale windfarm, located just outside Lerwick and operated by Shetland Aerogenerators Ltd. Since opening in 2000, the turbines at this wind farm have had an average capacity factor of 52% and, according to this report, in 2005 averaged a world record 57.9%. However, a Scottish opposition group found 124 separate occasions from 2008 to 2010 when the nation's wind output fell to less than 2% of installed capacity. On the west and northern coasts Scotland's wind regime can provide an average of 40% or higher.|$|E
