40|$|The blocks editor, such as {{the editor}} in Scratch, is widely applied for visual {{programming}} languages (VPL) nowadays. Despite it's friendly for non-programmers, it exists three main limitations while displaying block codes: (1) the readability, (2) the program structure, and (3) the re-use. To cope with these issues, we introduce a novel formatting <b>tool,</b> <b>block</b> shelves, into the editor for organizing blocks. A user could utilize shelves to constitute a user-defined structure for the VPL projects. Based on the experiment results, block shelves improves the block code navigating and searching significantly. Besides, for achieving code re-use, users could use shelf export/import to share/re-use their block codes between projects in the file format of eXtensible Markup Language (xml.) All functions were demonstrated on MIT App inventor 2, while all modifications were made in Google Blockly. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures, short pape...|$|E

The purpose of the paper is to rank the relative importance of each property studied for the heat resisting class of cast nickel and chromium alloys, subjected to repeated thermal cycles under typical industrial SPF conditions. A finite element model of a <b>tool</b> <b>block</b> within an industrial press furnace was developed to simulate the typical thermal cycles of an SPF tool, and predict the resulting mechanical performance.

The assembly is then cured by conventional methods, and afterwards the <b>tooling</b> <b>blocks</b> are removed so voids are formed. The ribs can be provided with integral tabs forming bonding areas for face sheets, and face sheets may be co-cured with the core ribs.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} the DC voltage control design of D-STATCOM when the D-STATCOM {{is used for}} load voltage regulation. Although, the DC voltage can be controlled by active current of the D-STATCOM, reactive current still affects the DC voltage. To eliminate this effect, the control strategy with elimination effect of the reactive current is proposed {{and the results of}} the control with and without the elimination the effect of the reactive current are compared. For obtaining the proportional and integral gains of the PI controllers, the symmetrical optimum and genetic algorithms methods are applied. The stability margin of these methods are obtained and discussed in detail. In addition, the performance of the DC voltage control based on symmetrical optimum and genetic algorithms methods are compared. Effectiveness of the controllers designed was verified through computer simulation performed by using Power System <b>Tool</b> <b>Block</b> (PSB) in SIMULINK/MATLAB. The simulation results demonstrated that the DC voltage control proposed is effective in regulating DC voltage when the D-STATCOM is used for load voltage regulation...|$|E
40|$|Frequency (RF) transmission, {{such as that}} in a Software Defined Radio (SDR) {{warrants}} the use of channelizers {{to extract}} required channels from the received RF frequency band and to perform follow-on baseband processing. The objective of our project is to Design a SDR using Xilinx system generator and describe the process of channelization {{as it applies to}} low power and highefficiency applications in wireless and Satellite Communications (SATCOM) domains. Smaller bandwidths and changing requirements of bandwidth calls for a programmable channel selection mechanism whereby channels and the resulting bandwidth can be selected based on target application, which is the primary principle in the Software Defined Radio based systems[3]. SDR is a radio in which some or the entire physical layer functions are software defined. Traditional hardware based radio devices have limited cross-functionality and they are modified only through a physical intervention. This results in higher production costs and minimal flexibility in supporting multiple waveform standards this problem is solved by SDR’s. In this project, a software defined radio is designed using Xilinx System Generator. System Generator’s FIR, FFT, FIFO and FDA Tool blocks are used.

40|$|Cryptographic {{primitives}} are {{the basic}} components of any cryptographic <b>tool.</b> <b>Block</b> ciphers, stream ciphers and hash functions are the fundamental primitives of symmetric cryptography. In symmetric cryptography, the communicating parties perform essentially the same operation and use the same key, if any. This thesis concerns cryptanalysis of stream ciphers and hash functions. The main contribution of this work is introducing the concept of probabilistic neutrality for the arguments of a function, a generalization {{of the definition of}} neutrality. An input argument of a given function is called neutral if it does not affect the output of the function. This simple idea has already been implicitly used in key recovery cryptanalysis of block ciphers and stream ciphers. However, in 2004, Biham and Chen explicitly used the idea of neutrality to speed up collision finding algorithms for hash functions. We call an input argument of a function probabilistic neutral if it does not have a “significant ” influence on the output of the function. Simply stated, it means that if the input argument is changed, the output of the function stays the same with a probability “close” to one. We will exploit the idea of probabilistic neutrality to assess the security of several stream ciphers and hash functions. Interestingly, all our cryptanalyses rely on neutrality and/or probabilistic neutrality. In other words, these concepts will appear as a common ingredient in all of our cryptanalytic algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that the probabilistic neutrality has found diverse applications in cryptanalysis...|$|E

40|$|Realistic {{implementation}} of graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNT) in energy devices and nano-electronics requires these carbon nanomaterials to have engineered architectures with sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms as building blocks. Graphene-CNT hybrid structures will provide attractive material properties of both CNTs and graphene with {{the capability to}} develop {{into a variety of}} geometries. The first part of this dissertation presents a scalable approach for synchronous fabrication of multiple component carbon hybrids. Large and uniform graphene-CNT hybrid films are successfully synthesized via simultaneous CVD growth of graphene layers and CNTs on copper foil substrates. The graphene-CNT hybrids have tuneable nano-architectonics, which is essential for application-oriented design of hierarchical graphene structures. The unique mechanism of synchronized CVD growth of CNT and graphene contributed significantly to the composure of the final carbon structure. We also demonstrate the potential of Block Copolymer (BCP) self-assembly as a nano-fabrication and patterning <b>tool.</b> <b>Block</b> copolymers are employed as templates to fabricate desired arrays of catalyst particles for CVD growth. Thoughtful choices of constituent blocks, polymerization degree, and volume fractions in BCPs, enable us to modulate the size and the separation distance of micro/nano-domains in the coplymer templates. Such versatility provides us with a powerful tool to control the diameter and separation distance of grown CNTs in the pillared architectures, and eventually allows us to tune the surface area in the resulting carbon hybrids. The metrology part of this work focuses on the utilization of fluorescence quenching microscopy (FQM) for quick visualization of doping in large-area graphene layers. Reactive ion plasma etching allows us to generate patterns of p-type CVD-grown graphene layers doped with fluorine. We specifically employ the dye 4 -(dicyanomethylene) - 2 -methyl- 6 -(4 -dimethylaminostyryl) - 4 H-pyran (DCM) as the fluorescent agent. The emission of DCM is quenched to different extents by p-doped and non-doped regions of graphene. This provides the fluorescence-imaging contrast, which is critical for visualization/mapping of the doped regions in high-throughput metrology techniques. To determine the method's resolution and scalability strengths, we increased the complexity of the doping pattern and successfully reproduced the mapping results. Upon that, we conducted a comparative investigation on steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence parameters of dye-coated pristine graphene and fluorinated graphene, using bare glass as the control sample. Fluorometry results support the increasing trend observed in the quenching level of DCM dye, from control sample to doped graphene to pristine graphene. The variation in fluorescence quenching by graphene after it is doped is also predicted by theory, as discussed in this work. Due to its simplicity, high speed, and small footprint, segmented FQM can be employed to address the chronic need for a microscopy based graphene metrology capable of "seeing" the features that are processed...|$|E
