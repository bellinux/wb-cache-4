5|$|In 1829, Worthington {{launched}} East India Pale Ale, {{their first}} IPA. It was exported to British expatriates across the Empire, mostly officers and civil servants, as the soldiers tended to drink <b>the</b> <b>cheaper</b> porter. In the 1870s it gained the White Shield logo, {{and by the}} end of the nineteenth century took on this name with drinkers.|$|E
5|$|In some units the {{alternator}} {{is essentially}} the same as that used in portable generating sets used to supply mains power, modified to produce a higher current at a lower voltage but still at the 50 or 60Hz grid frequency. In higher-quality units an alternator with more poles is used and supplies current at a higher frequency, such as 400Hz. The smaller amount of time the high-frequency waveform spends near zero makes it much easier to strike and maintain a stable arc than with <b>the</b> <b>cheaper</b> grid-frequency sets or grid-frequency mains-powered units.|$|E
5|$|Jevons {{warned that}} fuel {{efficiency}} gains tend to increase fuel use. But {{this does not}} imply that improved fuel efficiency is worthless: higher fuel efficiency enables greater production and a higher material quality of life. For example, a more efficient steam engine allowed <b>the</b> <b>cheaper</b> transport of goods and people that contributed to the Industrial Revolution. However, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased fuel efficiency, by itself, will not reduce the rate of depletion of fossil fuels.|$|E

5|$|Seven shorter NoL Eurostar trains {{for these}} Regional Eurostar {{services}} were built, but these services never ran. Predicted journey times of almost nine hours for Glasgow to Paris {{at the time}} of growth of low-cost air travel during the 1990s made the plans commercially unviable against <b>the</b> <b>cheaper</b> and quicker airlines. Other reasons that have been suggested for these services having never been run were both government policies and the disruptive privatisation of British Rail.|$|E
5|$|The Office of Arts and Crafts, {{subordinate}} to the Minister Steward, produced weapons, bronze mirrors, vessel wares, and other goods. The Office of Manufactures, also {{subordinate to}} the Minister Steward, made <b>the</b> <b>cheaper</b> weapons, utensils, and armor. Textiles and clothing worn by the emperor and royal family {{were made in the}} Weaving House of the West and Weaving House of the East; the latter was abolished in 28 BC, and the Weaving House of the West was renamed the Weaving House.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months before}} signing a full {{contract}} with Giant/Rockville, Uncle Tupelo recorded the tracks for No Depression over ten days in January 1990 at Fort Apache South, a musician-run {{studio in the}} Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. As the trio could not afford the cost of recording at a twenty-four track studio in nearby Cambridge, they settled on <b>the</b> <b>cheaper</b> Fort Apache studio. The album cost US$3,500 to produce, $1,000 of which went to in-house producers Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie. The band was interested in working with Slade and Kolderie after hearing their production of Dinosaur Jr.'s album Bug. The producers allowed Farrar {{to use the same}} 1961 Gibson Les Paul guitar that J. Mascis used on Bug, which gave the power chords on No Depression a richer tone.|$|E
50|$|The band {{formed in}} August 1976 as <b>the</b> <b>Cheap</b> Nasties. Their debut gig was at The Rivervale Hotel in mid-1977. They {{lay claim to}} the title of Perth's first punk band. <b>The</b> {{original}} <b>Cheap</b> Nasties' lineup was Kim Salmon (guitar/vocals), Neil Fernandes (guitar/vocals), Ken Seymour (bass/vocals) and Mark Betts (drums). Salmon left <b>the</b> <b>Cheap</b> Nasties in December 1977, to form The Scientists.|$|R

5|$|After {{the lookout}} {{at the summit}} was abandoned, the Forest Service changed {{strategies}} from a few lookouts very high up to many lookouts on lower peaks. They placed many lookouts around Adams including one on the southwest slopes of Adams at Madcat Meadows, one on Goat Butte, one on Council Bluff above Council Lake, and many other places farther from the mountain. Eventually these lookouts became obsolete as airplanes became <b>the</b> <b>cheaper</b> method to spot fires. Most all of these lookouts have since been abandoned and most all have been removed or left to disintegrate. One, Burley Mountain, is staffed every summer and another, Red Mountain, was restored in 2010 and decisions regarding its future are pending. Two lookouts remain nearby on the Yakama Indian Reservation. One, Satus Peak, is staffed every season and the other, Signal Peak, is staffed during periods of high fire danger.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, American News Company, by far {{the largest}} {{magazine}} distributor, was liquidated. Almost all the science-fiction magazines had to find a new distributor, and the smaller independent companies remaining in the market often demanded monthly publication and a larger format from the magazines they took on. Many of the magazines did not have the advertising revenue required to support these changes, and within two or three years, many of them had disappeared: the number of science-fiction magazines being published dropped from a high of 46 in 1953 to less than a dozen {{by the end of the}} decade. For a while If was hard to find on the news stands, but it survived. Quinn did try the slick format (using glossy paper, unlike <b>the</b> <b>cheaper</b> paper used for pulps and digests) for a companion magazine, Space Age, which he launched in November 1958; the experiment was unsuccessful, however. In an attempt to improve Ifs circulation, Quinn hired writer Damon Knight, whose first issue was October 1958. Circulation failed to increase, though this was at least partly due to the problems with distribution, and by early 1959, Quinn decided to sell the magazine. Knight's last issue was his third, dated February 1959.|$|E
5|$|Until 1927, {{the exact}} shades of the {{national}} colors were not legally specified. In practice, the actual hue, particularly of red, depended {{on what kind of}} red dye was available. In pre-partition Poland, crimson, due to its high price, was a color associated with the rich and the privileged. It could be obtained from the domestically harvested Polish cochineal, although imported alternatives were also available: kermes from the Mediterranean Basin (hence karmazyn, the Polish name of the color) and Mexican cochineal after the discovery of the New World. Crimson was reserved for the nobility and considered a symbol of the aristocracy, so that karmazyn became synonymous with a magnate. A royal ban on wearing this color could be a form of punishment; in the 14th century, the Nałęcz clan of Greater Poland were forbidden to dress in crimson for their ancestors' complicity in the assassination of King Premislaus in 1296. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, due to the influence of French fashion, crimson was largely replaced with <b>the</b> <b>cheaper</b> amaranth.|$|E

5000|$|There {{is often}} {{confusion}} between puppet bids and relays. A puppet bid requests partner to make <b>the</b> <b>cheapest</b> bid {{regardless of his}} hand. A relay bid requests partner to make a descriptive bid in response. The descriptive response can be natural (as in Stayman) or coded (as in Blackwood). A [...] "marionette" [...] bid {{is similar to a}} puppet bid except that it allows responses other than <b>the</b> <b>cheapest</b> bid with certain uncommon hand types.

5|$|Spices {{were among}} the most luxurious {{products}} available in the Middle Ages, the most common being black pepper, cinnamon (and <b>the</b> <b>cheaper</b> alternative cassia), cumin, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. They all had to be imported from plantations in Asia and Africa, which made them extremely expensive, and gave them social cachet such that pepper for example was hoarded, traded and conspicuously donated in the manner of gold bullion. It has been estimated that around 1,000 tons of pepper and 1,000tons of the other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the late Middle Ages. The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of grain for 1.5 million people. While pepper was the most common spice, the most exclusive (though not the most obscure in its origin) was saffron, used as much for its vivid yellow-red color as for its flavor, for according to the humours, yellow signified hot and dry, valued qualities; turmeric provided a yellow substitute, and touches of gilding at banquets supplied both the medieval love of ostentatious show and Galenic dietary lore: at the sumptuous banquet that Cardinal Riario offered the daughter of the King of Naples in June 1473, the bread was gilded. Among the spices that have now fallen into obscurity are grains of paradise, a relative of cardamom which almost entirely replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking, long pepper, mace, spikenard, galangal and cubeb. Sugar, unlike today, was considered to be a type of spice due to its high cost and humoral qualities. Few dishes employed just one type of spice or herb, but rather a combination of several different ones. Even when a dish was dominated by a single flavor it was usually combined with another to produce a compound taste, for example parsley and cloves or pepper and ginger.|$|E
5|$|When {{a member}} of the family died there were varying degrees of prostration and display of piety amongst family members, each one {{behaving}} differently according to the custom of kinship association with the deceased. There was to be no flashy or colorful attire while in the period of mourning, and proper funerary rituals were observed such as cleansing and clothing the deceased to rid him or her of impurities. This was one of the necessary steps in the observance of the deceased as one of the worshipped ancestors, which in turn raised the prestige of the family. Funerals were often expensive. A geomancer had to be consulted on where to bury the dead, caterers were hired to furnish the funeral banquet, and there was always the purchase of the coffin, which was burned along with paper images of horses, carriages, and servants in order for them to accompany the deceased into the next life. Due to the high cost of burial, most families opted for <b>the</b> <b>cheaper</b> practice of cremation. This was frowned upon by Confucian officials due to beliefs in the ancestral cult. They sought to ban the practice with prohibitions in 963 and 972; despite this, cremation amongst the poor and middle classes persisted. By the 12th century, the government came up with the solution of installing public cemeteries where a family's deceased could be buried on state owned property.|$|E

5000|$|The gods (UK English), or {{sometimes}} paradise, is a theatrical term, {{referring to the}} highest areas of a theatre such as the upper balconies. These are generally <b>the</b> <b>cheapest</b> seats.

Another is that those seated in [...] "the gods" [...] look down upon both {{the players and the}} occupants of more expensive seats, like the Olympian Gods looking down from Mount Olympus upon the lives of mortal men and women.|$|R
