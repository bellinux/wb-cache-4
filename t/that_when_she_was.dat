In the process, she became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. She revealed <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in school , she never saw anyone on television who looked like her, and she found it really weird because she thought there were so many people of South Asian descent in America and {{in other parts of the}} world. She also revealed that she did not want to be a stereotype of what Indians were usually seen as in global pop culture, saying that Indians never talk like Apu from The Simpsons.

Having appeared in over fifty films at that time, the series was also Chopra's first ever audition, which she found very new and nerve-wracking at the same time.|$|E
