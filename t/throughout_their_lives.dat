5|$|Although {{the layers}} of pinacocytes and choanocytes {{resemble}} the epithelia of more complex animals, they are not bound tightly by cell-to-cell connections or a basal lamina (thin fibrous sheet underneath). The flexibility of these layers and re-modeling of the mesohyl by lophocytes allow the animals to adjust their shapes <b>throughout</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> to take maximum advantage of local water currents.|$|E
5|$|Although Athenian {{women were}} not legally {{permitted}} to dispose of large sums of money, they frequently had large dowries which supported them <b>throughout</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> Income from a dowry could be significant. The larger a woman's dowry relative to her husband's wealth, the more influence she was likely {{to have in the}} household since she retained the dowry if the couple divorced. Athenian women could also acquire property by inheritance if they were the closest surviving relative, but could not contractually acquire or dispose of property.|$|E

5|$|Following work by {{the breed}} clubs to ensure that any reoccurring health {{problems}} are dealt with, there are no especially common conditions affecting the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. However, minor problems affecting the breed can include hypothyroidism, primary closed angle glaucoma and Cushing's syndrome. In order to combat glaucoma in the breed, the breed clubs recommend that Dandies should have a procedure called a gonioscopy performed on them at regular intervals <b>throughout</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> The Dandie is also at slightly higher risk of canine cancer than average. The average life expectancy of a Dandie Dinmont Terrier is 1113 years.|$|E
5|$|In Copenhagen in 1927 Heisenberg {{developed}} his uncertainty principle, which Bohr embraced. In a paper he {{presented at the}} Volta Conference at Como in September 1927, he demonstrated that the uncertainty principle could be derived from classical arguments, without quantum terminology or matrices. Einstein preferred the determinism of classical physics over the probabilistic new quantum physics to which he himself had contributed. Philosophical issues that arose from the novel aspects of quantum mechanics became widely celebrated subjects of discussion. Einstein and Bohr had good-natured arguments over such issues <b>throughout</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lifespans {{range from}} 3 to over 30years. Adults of most species are of one sex <b>throughout</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> The gonads are masses of {{developing}} gametes (ova or sperm), and most species have four gonads, two in each valve. Those of articulates {{lie in the}} channels of the mantle lobes, while those of inarticulates lie near the gut. Ripe gametes float into the main coelom and then exit into the mantle cavity via the metanephridia, which open {{on either side of}} the mouth. Most species release both ova and sperm into the water, but females of some species keep the embryos in brood chambers until the larvae hatch.|$|E
5|$|Public {{attitudes towards}} feral cats vary widely, ranging from seeing them as free-ranging pets, to {{regarding}} them as vermin. One common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed 'trap-neuter-return', where the cats are trapped, neutered, immunized against {{diseases such as}} rabies and the feline Panleukopenia and Leukemia viruses, and then released. Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats <b>throughout</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} modern {{studies that have}} {{supported}} the original autopsy finding. In a 2008 study, researchers analysed samples of Napoleon's hair from throughout his life, as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries. All samples had high levels of arsenic, approximately 100 {{times higher than the}} current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy, and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes <b>throughout</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning, and confirmed evidence of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer as the cause of death.|$|E

5|$|Through {{relatives}} Playford met {{his future}} wife Lorna Clark, who lived with her family in Nailsworth. Although both families were religiously devout, the Clarks were {{even more so than}} the Playfords, and a long courtship ensued. Taking her out on his Harley Davidson motorcycle at night, the two were forced to leave the theatre halfway through performances so as to not raise the ire of the Clarks. Before their wedding on 1 January 1928, they were engaged for three years. During their engagement, Playford built their new house on his property, mostly by his own hands and indented in the hills themselves; it remained their home <b>throughout</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the {{juvenile}} stage, a teleost {{looks more like}} its adult form. At this stage, its axial skeleton, internal organs, scales, pigmentation and fins are fully developed. The transition from larvae to juvenile can be short and fairly simple, lasting minutes or hours as in some damselfish, while in other species, like salmon, squirrelfish, gobies and flatfishes, the transition is more complex and takes several weeks to complete. At the adult stage, a teleost is able to produce viable gametes for reproduction. Like many fish, teleosts continue to grow <b>throughout</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> Longevity depends on the species with some gamefish like European perch and largemouth bass living up to 25 years. Rockfish {{appear to be the}} longest living teleosts with some species living over 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Beetles' flight {{wings are}} crossed with veins and are folded after landing, often along these veins, and stored below the elytra. A fold (jugum) of the {{membrane}} {{at the base}} of each wing is characteristic. Some beetles have lost the ability to fly. These include some ground beetles (Carabidae) and some true weevils (Curculionidae), as well as desert- and cave-dwelling species of other families. Many have the two elytra fused together, forming a solid shield over the abdomen. In a few families, both the ability to fly and the elytra have been lost, as in the glow-worms (Phengodidae), where the females resemble larvae <b>throughout</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> The presence of elytra and wings does not always indicate that the beetle will fly. For example, the tansy beetle walks between habitats despite being physically capable of flight.|$|E

5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who had chosen to reject God <b>throughout</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> would continue to do so after death.|$|E
5|$|On 14 January 1892, {{six weeks}} after the formal engagement, Albert Victor died of pneumonia, leaving George second in line to the throne, and likely to succeed after his father. George had only just {{recovered}} from a serious illness himself, after being confined to bed for six weeks with typhoid fever, the disease that was thought to have killed his grandfather Prince Albert. Queen Victoria still regarded Princess May as a suitable match for her grandson, and George and May grew close during their shared period of mourning. A year after Albert Victor's death, George proposed to May and was accepted. They married on 6 July 1893 at the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace, London. <b>Throughout</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> they remained devoted to each other.

5|$|Young et al. (2012) used biomechanical {{modelling}} {{to examine the}} performance of the diplodocine skull. It was concluded that the proposal that its dentition was used for bark-stripping was not supported by the data, which showed that under that scenario, the skull and teeth would undergo extreme stresses. The hypotheses of branch-stripping and/or precision biting were both shown to be biomechanically plausible feeding behaviors. Diplodocine teeth were also continually replaced <b>throughout</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> usually in less than 35 days, as was discovered by Michael D'Emic et al. Within each tooth socket, as many as five replacement teeth were developing to replace the next one. Studies of the teeth also reveal that it preferred different vegetation from the other sauropods of the Morrison, such as Camarasaurus. This may have better allowed the various species of sauropods to exist without competition.|$|E

5|$|Bobcats {{generally}} begin breeding {{by their}} second summer, though females may start {{as early as}} their first year. Sperm production begins each year by September or October, and the male is fertile into the summer. A dominant male travels with a female and mates with her several times, generally from winter until early spring; this varies by location, but most mating takes place during February and March. The pair may undertake {{a number of different}} behaviors, including bumping, chasing, and ambushing. Other males may be in attendance, but remain uninvolved. Once the male recognizes the female is receptive, he grasps her in the typical felid neck grip and mates with her. The female may later go on to mate with other males, and males generally mate with several females. During courtship, the otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud screams, hisses, or other sounds. Research in Texas has suggested establishing a home range is necessary for breeding; studied animals with no set range had no identified offspring. The female has an estrous cycle of 44 days, with the estrus lasting five to ten days. Bobcats remain reproductively active <b>throughout</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{usually have}} 26 teeth: the incisors, {{known as the}} tusks, 12 {{deciduous}} premolars, and 12 molars. Unlike most mammals, which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth rotation <b>throughout</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in {{at the back of}} the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out when the elephant is four to six years old. The third set is lost at 9–15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth lasts until the elephant is in its early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in African elephants.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival in}} Britain, Seymour was celebrated and {{rewarded with a}} baronetcy for his second victory in {{less than six months}} while all of his {{officers}} were promoted. Niémen was purchased into the Navy for the sum of £29,979-2-10d, which was split between the government, the crew {{and a number of other}} parties. The share that went to the captors came under dispute: Mends had no intention of abiding by Seymour's agreement with Maitland and refused to allow Emerald to share in the prize money. Seymour and Maitland took Mends to court and the ensuing legal battle lasted years, Mends deliberately exaggerating his role in the capture of Niémen in public (although privately admitting that the victory was entirely Seymour's). Seymour and Mends became bitter enemies and their animosity continued <b>throughout</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> although both remained in the Navy and had successful careers. Forty years later, the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.|$|E
