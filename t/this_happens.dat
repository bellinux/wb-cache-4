5|$|Some pugs {{are also}} born with {{stenotic}} nares {{which can also}} inhibit their breathing.

5|$|Although gallium has {{no natural}} {{function}} in biology, gallium ions interact with {{processes in the}} body {{in a manner similar}} to iron(III). Because these processes include inflammation, a marker for many disease states, several gallium salts are used (or are in development) as pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals in medicine. When gallium ions are mistakenly taken up in place of iron(III) by bacteria such as Pseudomonas, the ions interfere with respiration, and the bacteria die. <b>This</b> <b>happens</b> because iron is redox-active, allowing the transfer of electrons during respiration, while gallium is redox-inactive.|$|E

5|$|Formation of {{the carbon}} atomic nucleus {{requires}} a nearly simultaneous triple collision of alpha particles (helium nuclei) within {{the core of a}} giant or supergiant star which is known as the triple-alpha process, as the products of further nuclear fusion reactions of helium with hydrogen or another helium nucleus produce lithium-5 and beryllium-8 respectively, both of which are highly unstable and decay almost instantly back into smaller nuclei. <b>This</b> <b>happens</b> in conditions of temperatures over 100 megakelvin and helium concentration that the rapid expansion and cooling of the early universe prohibited, and therefore no significant carbon was created during the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|It is even {{possible}} {{that in any}} one generation no marbles of a particular colour are chosen, meaning they have no offspring. In this example, if no red marbles are selected, the jar representing the new generation contains only blue offspring. If <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> the red allele has been lost permanently in the population, while the remaining blue allele has become fixed: all future generations are entirely blue. In small populations, fixation can occur {{in just a few}} generations.|$|E
5|$|A back-building thunderstorm, {{commonly}} referred to as a training thunderstorm, is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the west or southwest side in the Northern Hemisphere), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. The storm is really a multi-cell storm with new, more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side, replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind. When <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> catastrophic flooding is possible. In Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in devastating flash flooding. A similar event occurred in Boscastle, England, on 16 August 2004.|$|E

Just after Hamasaki finishes singing the second chorus, an instrumental break happens and has Hamasaki looking at the now abandoned puppet show. A truck then drives past, which vibrates the puppet show's stage, causing the doll to fall on the ground and its strings become tangled. <b>This</b> <b>happens</b> to Hamasaki as the doll; she faints in the dark atmosphere land, with strings attached to her. Hamasaki, sitting on the bench, starts to cry and sings the remaining of the song. It ends with the taxi driver, who finishes day dreaming about the marionettes dolls, opening the door for Hamasaki to enter.|$|E
5|$|Dunbar {{drops out}} of the race due to the {{discovery}} of a meeting she'd had with Goodwin {{a few days before the}} attempt on Underwood's life. Underwood begins planning to maneuver Claire into the VP spot and to use the NSA to illegally obtain voter information and spy on the Republican nominee, Will Conway (Joel Kinnaman). <b>This</b> <b>happens</b> while Underwood and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill for the sole purpose of creating an atmosphere divisive enough to weed out potential running mates. During the resulting open convention, Underwood intimidates the front-runner, Secretary of State Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson), into surrendering her delegates, and uses the public sympathy from Claire's mother's death to ensure that he and Claire are nominated.|$|E
5|$|Hassler Whitney {{showed that}} if the graph is 3-connected then the embedding, and thus the dual graph, is unique. By Steinitz's theorem, these graphs are exactly the {{polyhedral}} graphs, the graphs of convex polyhedra. A planar graph is 3-vertex-connected {{if and only if}} its dual graph is 3-vertex-connected. More generally, a planar graph has a unique embedding, and therefore also a unique dual, if and only if it is a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected planar graph (a graph formed from a 3-vertex-connected planar graph by replacing some of its edges by paths). For some planar graphs that are not 3-vertex-connected, such as the complete bipartite graph , the embedding is not unique, but all embeddings are isomorphic. When <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> correspondingly, all dual graphs are isomorphic.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular enemies, the player also needs to defeat several bosses and mini-bosses throughout the game. By defeating enemies, the player gains experience points, which make the hero's level increase; when <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> the player gets points to spend on four different disciplines, each of which gives the hero access to different abilities and enhances different stats associated with the discipline: Warrior is associated with physical attacks, Monk with defense and health points, Mage with magic attacks and magic points, and Sage {{with an increase in}} the weapon limit gauge. Sometimes when enemies are defeated, they drop items; the player can carry items with them, which are grouped into stacks, each taking up one slot in the inventory.|$|E
5|$|Lioba's emotionless state causes her to act less rationally and as {{a result}} the {{corporation}} stop her. It is deemed that she has to be deleted. Before <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> John manages to find her and give her back her emotions. They agree to leave Planet B and meet up in real life. However, after they do, Lioba becomes ill and goes into a hospital, where John discovers that Medley is one of the staff. John discovers that not only is he still in Planet B, but Lioba has no physical body so she cannot leave. Lioba's illness comes from a patch designed to delete the rogues. John and Medley help to cure Lioba, and they unite in order to prevent more rogues from being destroyed. Cerberus then confronts them and battles with Medley, while John and Lioba flee to safety.|$|E
5|$|Mass {{transfer}} {{came to an}} {{end when}} the surface layers of the mass-losing star were depleted, and the core slowly shrunk to a white dwarf. Now the stars peacefully orbit around each other. The long-term prospects for PSR B1620-26 b are poor, though. The triple system, which is much more massive than a typical isolated star in M4, is slowly drifting down into the core of the cluster, where the density of stars is very high. In a billion years or so, the triple will probably have another close encounter with a nearby star. The most common outcome of such encounters is that the lightest companion is ejected from the multiple star system. If <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> PSR B1620-26 b will most likely be ejected completely from M4, and will spend the rest of its existence wandering alone in interstellar space as an interstellar planet.|$|E

5|$|Only wall {{clouds that}} rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds {{may be a}} visual manifestation of a {{low-level}} mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as <b>this</b> <b>happens</b> or shortly after; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases {{by the time it}} reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the cloud base and surface.|$|E
5|$|The Buddhist {{version of}} the Bhasmasura tale {{continues}} with Shiva (Ishvara) asking the female-Vishnu, who is seated on a swing, to marry him. She asks Shiva to get the permission of his wife Umayangana to take her home. Shiva returns with Umayangana's consent to find the female-Vishnu pregnant, who sends him back to get permission to bring a pregnant woman home. When he returns, a child is born and female-Vishnu is pregnant again. She requests Shiva to seek approval to bring a pregnant woman with a child home. <b>This</b> <b>happens</b> six more times. Finally, Shiva brings Umayangana with him to witness the miraculous woman. Vishnu then returns to his male form. Umayangana embraces the six youngest children merging them into the six-headed Skanda, while the eldest, named Aiyanayaka ("eldest brother") remains intact. Aiyanayaka is identified with Aiyanar.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} initial {{course of the}} disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is {{characterized}} by unpredictable attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity. After some years, {{many of the people}} who have this subtype begin to experience neurologic decline without acute relapses. When <b>this</b> <b>happens</b> it is called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Other, less common, courses of the disease are the primary progressive (decline from the beginning without attacks) and the progressive-relapsing (steady neurologic decline and superimposed attacks). Different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks, for patients who have the relapsing-remitting subtype, for patients who have the progressive subtypes, for patients without a diagnosis of MS who have a demyelinating event, and for managing the various consequences of MS.|$|E
