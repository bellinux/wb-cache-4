After that point, they carefully scrutinized entire films, and once one was selected and assured the rights, committed to completing the episode with that film. Obtaining the rights was handled by the cable networks. Some licensing required buying film rights in packages, with the selected bad movies included in a catalog of otherwise good films, making the negotiations odd since the network was only interested in the bad film. Other times, the rights to the film were poorly documented, and the network would follow the chain of custody to locate the copyright owner as to secure broadcast rights.|$|E
2500|$|The {{goals of}} the 1980 Literacy Campaign were socio-political, {{strategic}} as well as educational. It was the most prominent campaign {{with regards to the}} new education system. Illiteracy in Nicaragua was significantly reduced from 50.3% to 12.9%. One of the government's major concerns was the previous education system under the Somoza regime which did not see education as a major factor {{on the development of the}} country. As mentioned in the Historical Program of the FSLN of 1969, education was seen as a right and the pressure <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> the promises made in the program was even stronger. 1980 was declared the [...] "Year of Literacy" [...] and the major {{goals of the}} campaign that started only 8 months after the FSLN took over.

50|$|The {{plans of}} {{incorporating}} the Gagauz within the Turkish Orthodox Church resurfaced {{after the fall}} of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. The Turkish government proposed to Stepan Topal, President of the independent region of Gagauzia, to tie the Gagauz Christians, numbering according to estimates to up to 120,000 Christians to the Autocephalous Turkish Orthodox Patriarchate. Stephan Topal visited Turkey in 1994 and met with Papa Eftim III and eventually 100 families accompanied by 4 priests came to Istanbul to be possibly part of the Turkish Orthodox Church community. Nevertheless, the Gagauz leaders reconsidered their plans preferring <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>committed</b> through bonds <b>to</b> the Russian Orthodox Patriarchate instead. Author Mustafa Ekincikli says if the plan had succeeded, the Gagauz would truly establish a valid Turkish Orthodox Church community.|$|R

Identifying and understanding the various workplace elements that influence an employee’s decision <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> and <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> the organisation {{has to be a}} priority human resource focus that has direct bottom-line impact. Particularly the current environment provides employees with a vast array of employment choices and higher than usual pay levels. Employee Engagement is a measurable degree of an employee's positive or negative emotional attachment to their job, colleagues and organization which profoundly influences their willingness to learn and perform at work. Organisations are continuously searching for ways to increase their competitiveness as a means to survive in the global economy. Outcomes of employee engagement may include lower accident rates, higher productivity, fewer conflicts, more innovation, lower numbers leaving and reduced sickness rates. An engaged employee also experiences a blend of job satisfaction, organizational commitment, job involvement and feelings of empowerment. Keeping all these developments in view, this paper will be focused attention on how the employee engagement strategies help in enhancing competitiveness for organizational success...|$|R
40|$|Today, in a {{world of}} {{consumption}} where almost everything is branded, every consumer has a brand that they love, a so called lovemarks. Nowadays, it takes more than just a commercial <b>to</b> make consumers <b>stay</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> a brand. Consumers need to relate on a more personal level. There lies a deep rooted love, consistent over long periods of time, making the luxury brand consumer’s one the most loyal consumers in the world. Consequently, it is the consumers that decide what a lovemarks is, and why they go back to repurchasing that brand again, a kind of on-going romance between consumer-brand.   The purpose of this dissertation is to explore why consumers develop emotional attachment and loyalty towards brands, leading to a long-lasting, devoted relationship between the consumer and the brand. The aim is to find out elements that are needed to love a brand consistently. The outcome of this study will provide a better look into the consumer’s attitude towards lovemark brands.   A qualitative study has been performed on consumer attitudes towards their lovemarks brand, and the language they use when describing their motive <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> loyal <b>to</b> their brand of preference. Furthermore, the view of what elements are needed for them develop emotional attachment towards that brand is explored.   The conclusion of this dissertation is that in order for consumers to develop loyalty and emotional attachment to brands, they need the elements of emotion, quality, trust, image, timeless fashion, and tradition. These elements combined, make the ultimate consumer that many brands want to have. ...|$|R

Villante started his first game against Marshall University, as a true freshman, at middle linebacker. Gian kept his starting role the rest of his freshman year. The following season Villante was named a 2004 1st Team Defensive I-AA All-American by The Sports Network. He was regarded as a potential NFL linebacker prospect. The New York Giants, New York Jets, Indianapolis Colts, and Philadelphia Eagles all expressed interest in Villante. Villante wrestled for Hofstra where he became close with NCAA All-American wrestler and future UFC Middleweight Champion Chris Weidman.|$|R
40|$|Social {{movements}} {{and their effects}} on society have been attractive for researcher for over a century. Especially together with the workers’ movements in the 19 th century, different approaches and explanations were produced from distinct point of views in order to analyse the reasons, forming process, participants, aims, effects, emergence and decline processes, and results of social movements have been discussed and analysed. In these years, features, aims and participants of social movements have also changed. Especially {{in the last four}} decades new explanation were produced in order to explain this change such as resource mobilisation and new social movement approach. Change in people’s experiences, globalisation, and improvement in technologies have increased awareness of people about the problems of their everyday experiences. In this route, urban poor’s experiences in Turkey changed due to social, political, demographic and economic developments particularly in the last three decades. Urban poor migrants, previously, had different tools such as family/kinship solidarity, continuing tie with their villages and opportunity to have informal urban settlements. These tools eased their integration into the cities they migrated and were used as coping mechanisms in order to reach better living standards and upward mobility. However, these tools lost their effectiveness due to change in the structures, earthquakes and economic crisis during 1990 s. Therefore, newly coming migrants could not involve with these traditional welfare mechanisms. However, even in the environment where traditional mechanisms have weakened and during economic crisis, some segments of urban poor migrants appeared <b>to</b> be <b>stayed</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> the state and social order. Although it is anticipated that these problems cause frustration and anger for poor migrants against the rest of society and the state, thus these factors increase their demand to form and participate in social movements, these groups prefer <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> away from this kind of {{movements and}} do not participate in social movements even if these movements aim to defend their rights and increase their living conditions. Therefore, the focus of this research is exploring the main factors that affect urban poor migrants’ attitudes and behaviours towards the state and society in Turkey even it is anticipated that urban poor migrants experience relative deprivation and this might cause frustration and grievance towards society and state. The research found a number of factors that affect urban poor migrants’ attitudes and approaches towards the state and the rest of society. It was also found that some factors which are closely related to Turkey’s unique features are more effective amongst all factors...|$|R
40|$|On average, 70 - 80 % of advisors leave {{financial}} services within their {{first three years}} in the industry (Mc Manus & Kelly, 1999; Mellor, 2012; Seligman, 1998). Addressing the financial and humanitarian costs of this high turnover of staff creates a demand for a tool that can assist in the selection of individuals who are more likely <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> and <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> the field of {{financial services}}. Consequently a New Zealand consulting firm developed the OnFire measure to help predict the survival and success of advisors within the field of financial services. The measure incorporates six personality dispositions, each derived from academic literature and anecdotal data from within the field. These dispositions were: Drive, Extraversion, Influence, Norm Following, Optimism and Resilience. This research assessed the validity and reliability of the OnFire measure in order to determine its psychometric properties. Surveys were distributed to various professional associations operating within New Zealand’s financial and insurance industries. The study obtained a total of 204 participants, 78. 5 % of whom had been in the financial service industry for ten or more years. The factor structure, convergent validity and nomological network integrity were explored for each of the OnFire variables. Finally, the criterion-related validity was determined for each of the OnFire scales using the industry commitment and industry tenure of financial advisors. When determining the factor structure of the OnFire scales, three scales were each found to consist of two factors. Drive was separated into Inner Drive and Workaholism, Extraversion into Group Orientation and Social Skills, and Norm Following into Process Following and Group Following. Seven of the 57 OnFire items were removed due to insignificant factor loadings. The Workaholism factor of the Drive scale and the Process Following factor of the Norm Following scale failed to achieve convergent validity with the previously established International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) scales. Furthermore, the Extraversion scale, Norm Following scale and Workaholism factor obtained alpha reliabilities below Nunnally's (1994) recommended level and did not achieve a meaningful relationship with the criterion-related variable of industry commitment. Interestingly, none of the variables obtained a significant correlation with the other criterion-related variable of industry tenure. This was attributed to the high level of range restriction within the study. Overall, the current study found partial support for the psychometric validity of the OnFire measure. Specifically, the Influence scale, Optimism scale, Resilience scale and Inner Drive factor demonstrated their psychometric utility, whereas the other OnFire scales may require further research and development in order for their use in the selection and development of advisors to be fully endorsed within the field of financial services...|$|R
5000|$|The personality-job fit theory postulates that a person's [...] traits {{will reveal}} insight as to {{adaptability}} within an organization. The degree of confluence between {{a person and}} the organization is expressed as their Person-Organization (P-O) fit. This is {{also referred to as}} a person-environment fit. A common measure of the P-O fit is workplace efficacy; the rate at which workers are able to complete tasks. These tasks are mitigated by workplace environs- for example, a worker who works more efficiently as an individual than in a team will have a higher P-O fit for a workplace that stresses individual tasks (such as accountancy). By matching the right personality with the right job, company workers can achieve a better synergy and avoid pitfalls such as high turnover and low job satisfaction.

This research responds to {{a gap in the}} professional literature by examining this rare case of governmental agency transformation.; Political and organizational events converged over time to make the transformation of the CIWMB possible. These events provide historical context for the series of actions that occurred over an eighteen year period.; Three phases of the transformation are identified: Phase 1, the organization in a state of equilibrium; Phase 2, the punctuated equilibrium of the organization; and Phase 3, the transformation process.; Utilizing the grounded theory method and through structured and open-ended interviews of key participants eight themes are identified that occurred during the three phases of the transformation. These themes were: Industry-Oriented - "Old Board," Timing of the Change, Radical Mission Change, Key Policy Components of AB 939, Organization Structure, Administration, New Critical Tasks, Public Process and Dialogue. The historical record, legislative initiatives, budgets and personnel documents and periodicals corroborate the themes derived from the interviews.; This research into the transformation of the CIWMB provides an additional perspective on how a full-time board may be more likely <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> focused and <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> policy implementation as opposed to classical bureaucratic organizations where the initial excitement of new programs wanes and is replaced by mundane routines. The full-time board structure of the CIWMB created a different context where the bulk of the agency’s bureaucratic routines were left to the Executive Director. Secondly, CIWMB board members served limited fixed-term appointments and were appointed by diverse authorities (executive and legislative) which created a dynamic tension amongst Board members that sharpened the focus of the debates in the public arena over directions to policy priorities. Additionally, the board members were required to cast their policy votes publicly amidst the eyes and ears of observant stakeholders representing a wide array of interests. The constant involvement of these diverse stakeholders added to the dynamic tension of the board policy process and enhanced its probability of remaining actively committed and engaged...|$|R
