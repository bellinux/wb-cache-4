The primary action at this point was Abt and Berthon battling for 15th place and both drivers caught Marciello's lapped car.

Weather {{conditions}} {{at the start of}} the event were dry and sunny with an air temperature of [...] and an track temperature at [...] On the grid, pole position starter Dillmann made a clean getaway and held off Quaife-Hobbs to keep the lead heading towards the first corner. Quaife-Hobbs attempted to steer onto the inside line but ran wide which contributed to some contact within the field. Coletti made a fast start and moved from seventh to third by driving on the outside line at turn one. Bird initially got away from his starting position slowly but Quaife-Hobbs's blocking of Coletti allowed him into second place on the inside. Rossi was clipped by Nasr going into the first corner and the latter broke Rossi's front wing. Leimer was on the inside line driving into turn one and Rossi's nose cone made contact with the sidepod and the <b>turning</b> <b>vane</b> of Leimer's car. This affected Leimer for the rest of the event as debris was lodged in his car's sidepod. Haryanto and Ericsson both sustained damage after they hit each other and went to the pit lane before resuming.|$|E
50|$|Mercedes brought {{its first}} major {{aerodynamic}} upgrade at the , changing the {{car from the}} front to the rear. The most obvious change was {{the introduction of a}} new nose which included a never seen before under-nose <b>turning</b> <b>vane</b> to help create a type of skirt underneath the car. Furthermore Mercedes redesigned the area of the bargeboards which subsequently sported three R-shaped upstands. They also revised the winglet on the wishbone extension and introduced new camera mounts, a revised floor ahead of the rear tyre, a revised rear wing, and a new two-tier monkey seat. According to Michael Schmidt from German magazine auto motor und sport, the upgrade wasn't supposed to have major time gains (apparently only 0.1 s). Mercedes' main targets were to make the car more consistent and to bring its tyres more easily into the operating window, as previously these had been their main deficits in comparison to Ferrari.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis presents a {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) study {{on the effects of}} turning vanes and their placement in an exhaust duct with a sharp bend of ninety degrees and the application toward waste heat recovery devices. CFD models were implemented in ANSYS/CFX to handle flow in both laminar and turbulent regimes. Applying the principles from the Reynolds-averaging Navier-Stokes governing equations as well as the k-ε turbulent model, accurate simulations were performed to explore the behavior of exhaust gas flow field, pressure drops and recirculation zone sizes for various flow Reynolds (Re) numbers. The effects of <b>turning</b> <b>vane</b> location, vane setting angle, and number of vanes were evaluated. Flow visualization was used as a means of determining ideal locations for future installation of WHR devices. Results for 5000 <Re< 2 x 105 showed significant improvement in pressure drop across the 90 -degree duct with a single <b>turning</b> <b>vane,</b> showing ranges of 50 – 70 % reduction in overall pressure drop across the duct. This pressure reduction could yield significant fuel savings compared to an engine or generator without a <b>turning</b> <b>vane.</b> Increasing the number of vanes neither reduced the pressure drop further, nor did it reduce the size of the primary recirculation zone.

40|$|Abstract—The bypass {{exhaust system}} of a 160 MW {{combined}} cycle has been modeled and analyzed using numerical simulation in 2 D prospective. Analysis {{was carried out}} using the commercial numerical simulation software, FLUENT 6. 2. All inputs {{were based on the}} technical data gathered from working conditions of a Siemens V 94. 2 gas turbine, installed in the Yazd power plant. This paper deals with reduction of pressure drop in bypass exhaust system using <b>turning</b> <b>vanes</b> mounted in diverter box in order to alleviate turbulent energy dissipation rate above diverter box. The geometry of such <b>turning</b> <b>vanes</b> has been optimized based on the flow pattern at diverter box inlet. The results show that the use of optimized <b>turning</b> <b>vanes</b> in diverter box can improve the flow pattern and eliminate vortices around sharp edges just before the silencer. Furthermore, this optimization could decrease the pressure drop in bypass exhaust system and leads to higher plant efficiency.
