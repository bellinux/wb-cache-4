5|$|A carcass was {{a hollow}} {{projectile}} usually formed either by an iron cage of ribs joining two small rings or a cast iron ball with holes. A carcass was {{so named because}} the iron cage was thought to resemble <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> of a body. A carcass {{was filled with a}} highly flammable mixture. Carcasses were used for the first time by the French under Louis XIV in 1672.|$|E
5|$|Australia reached 3/135 when Miller and Arthur Morris {{departed}} {{in quick}} succession. With Sid Barnes retiring hurt {{because of a}} blow to <b>the</b> <b>ribs,</b> Tallon came in at 5/139, effectively six wickets down and made 18 {{in half an hour}} before falling at 6/172. Australia managed to reach 221 and avoid the follow on.|$|E

5|$|The {{cervical}} vertebrae of {{the neck}} had broad neural spines that increased in height towards the body. The front part of the neural spines had well developed entheses, which was common among adult dinosaurs, and indicates the presence of large ligaments which helped support the massive head. The dorsal vertebrae of the back had centra (or bodies) that were short relative to their width, and their neural spines were short and narrow. The dorsal vertebrae were tightly spaced, which limited the downwards movement of the back. The neural spines had ossified (turned to bone) tendons, which also overlapped some of the vertebrae. <b>The</b> <b>ribs</b> {{of the last four}} back vertebrae were fused to them, and the ribcage was very broad {{in this part of the}} body. <b>The</b> <b>ribs</b> had scars that show where muscles attached to them. The caudal vertebrae of the tail had centra that were slightly amphicoelous, meaning they were concave on both sides. The interlocked zygapophyses (articular processes) of the caudal vertebrae formed a U-shape when seen from above, instead of the more usual V-shape.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop can be {{distinguished}} from its close relative the Pacific pink scallop (Chlamys rubida) by the valves being less rounded and by the small curved spines on <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> which give it a rough texture whereas the Pacific pink feels smooth. The glossy white interior of the spiny scallop's shell often has a purplish blotch near the umbone, not present in the Pacific pink.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{features}} of the cervical vertebrae which distinguish Dinocephalosaurus from other protorosaurs include the low and keel-like neural spines, and the anterior and posterior (rear) articular surfaces of the vertebrae both being concave (amphicoelous). In the first ten vertebrae, the bottom margin is also concave. The long, slender cervical ribs bear frontal projections free of the vertebral bodies, which are also unique to Dinocephalosaurus. These ribs are aligned along the neck and bridge multiple consecutive vertebral joints, from two or three consecutive joints in the anterior the neck to five or six in the posterior neck. There appear to be no distinct processes on the vertebrae for articulation with <b>the</b> <b>ribs.</b>|$|E
50|$|Originally, all {{destinations}} were {{looked up in}} <b>the</b> <b>RIB.</b> Perhaps <b>the</b> first step in speeding routers {{was to have a}} separate RIB and FIB in main memory, with the FIB, typically with fewer entries than <b>the</b> <b>RIB,</b> being organized for fast destination lookup.

5|$|England resumed on {{the second}} day at 231/7 and Australia was unable to break through with the new ball. Bedser defied the Australians for 145 minutes, adding 37 and {{featuring}} in a 121-run partnership with Compton. Soon after, Pollard pulled a ball from Johnson into <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> of Barnes, who was standing at short leg, forcing him into hospital. The last two wickets fell and England were bowled out for 363. Compton was unbeaten on 145 in 324 minutes of batting, having struck 16 fours. Lindwall took 4/99 and Johnston 3/67.|$|E
5|$|More than 1,400 gastroliths (stomach stones, 8 to 87mm in size) {{were found}} among <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> and gastralia of {{specimen}} MPC-D100/127. The ratio of gastrolith mass to total weight, 0.0022, supports {{the theory that}} these gastroliths helped the toothless animals in grinding their food. Features such {{as the presence of}} a beak and a U-shaped, downturned jaw, are indicators of facultative (optional) herbivory among coelurosaurian theropods. In spite of these features, fish vertebrae and scales were also found among the gastroliths, which suggests that it was an omnivore. Ornithomimosaurs in general are thought to have fed on both plants and small animals.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 2017, Paul was {{assaulted}} by a neighbor, Rene Boucher (aged 59), a former anesthesiologist. As Paul was wearing noise-cancelling headphones while mowing his lawn, Boucher {{was able to}} surprise him. Boucher was arrested by state troopers and charged with one count of fourth degree assault and released on a $7,500 bond. Initial announcements stated that Paul suffered only minor injuries but subsequent news reports said he sustained five broken ribs and lacerations to his lungs. Some sources later stated that six ribs had been broken and that pleural effusion had set in. Three of <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> were displaced fractures.|$|E
50|$|Rib tips (or brisket) {{are found}} {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> spare <b>ribs</b> by <b>the</b> sternum. <b>The</b> <b>rib</b> tips have a high {{proportion}} of cartilage. <b>The</b> <b>rib</b> tips give <b>the</b> spare <b>ribs</b> a rounded appearance.

5|$|Reptilian lungs {{typically}} receive air via {{expansion and}} contraction of <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> driven by axial muscles and buccal pumping. Crocodilians also {{rely on the}} hepatic piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved into the lungs by Boyle's law. Turtles, which are unable to move their ribs, instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air {{in and out of}} the lungs.|$|E

Cobblepot orders his gang to attack downtown Gotham, ruining the Mayor's reputation and giving Shreck {{the opportunity to}} propose Cobblepot as a replacement. Batman confronts him, but Catwoman firebombs Shreck's department store and Cobblepot escapes. Batman and Catwoman get into a fight in which Batman almost kills Catwoman but saves her.

5|$|The known {{material}} {{includes two}} cervical vertebrae, nine dorsal vertebrae, a few ribs, {{a fragment of}} a pubis, and many gastroliths. Of the material, only the vertebrae are diagnostic, with <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> and pubis being too fragmentary or general to distinguish Dinheirosaurus. This material was first described as in the genus Lourinhasaurus, but differences were noticed and in 1999 Bonaparte and Mateus redescribed the material under the new binomial Dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis. Another specimen, ML 418, thought to be Dinheirosaurus, is now known to be from another Portuguese diplodocid. This means that Dinheirosaurus lived alongside many theropods, sauropods, thyreophorans and ornithopods, {{as well as at}} least one other diplodocid.|$|E
5000|$|A rib steak is a beef steak sliced from <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> primal of a beef animal, with rib bone attached.

5|$|The main {{benefit of}} breast {{brachytherapy}} compared to whole breast irradiation {{is that a}} high dose of radiation can be precisely applied to the tumour while sparing radiation to healthy breast tissues and underlying structures such as <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> and lungs. APBI can typically be completed {{over the course of}} a week. The option of brachytherapy may be particularly important in ensuring that working women, the elderly or women without easy access to a treatment centre, are able to benefit from breast-conserving therapy due to the short treatment course compared with WBI (which often requires more visits over the course of 1–2 months).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ribs</b> {{are bound}} to the spine by {{flexible}} cartilage, which allows the ribcage to collapse rather than snap under high pressure. While sperm whales are well adapted to diving, repeated dives to great depths have long-term effects. Bones show the same pitting that signals decompression sickness in humans. Older skeletons showed the most extensive pitting, whereas calves showed no damage. This damage may indicate that sperm whales are susceptible to decompression sickness, and sudden surfacing could be lethal to them.|$|E
5|$|The {{trunk of}} Dinocephalosaurus {{has at least}} 26 {{vertebrae}}.

Each of the gastralia in Dinocephalosaurus is composed of three elements instead of four as in Tanystropheus; they differ in that Dinocephalosaurus only has one element on the midline, while Tanystropheus has two elements that combine to form a midline bar.|$|E
40|$|Sound Pressure {{measurements}} were taken of several 2. 44 m long thin beams which had 0. 635 cm wide t-ribs centered on them. The beams were excited by a chirp signal with the frequency range of 500 Hz to 1500 Hz. Two rib attachment methods were {{used on the}} beams. One group of beams were machined out of thick stock to the geometry of a rib welded to a beam to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> and attachment were one continuous media. The other group of beams had ribs that were welded on. Fillets from the welding process were subjected to heat-treatment and machining {{to determine the effect}} of static stress in fillets. Farfield sound radiation from the beam and phase speeds of waves propagating through the beam were used to investigate the effects of <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> and its attachment properties on the beam response;The experimental results showed that the geometry and stress state of the attachment are the main parameters that alter wave propagation and sound radiation. Also, the maximum sound radiation from <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> was not centered directly over <b>the</b> <b>rib,</b> but rather ahead of <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> location. Furthermore, substantial phase speed increases were observed around the shaker location and <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> location;Attachment geometry and stress information were incorporated into a Euler-Bernoulli wave-based model. This wave-based model reproduced the static stress effect on the farfield sound radiation, but didn 2 ̆ 7 t reproduce the position of the sound radiation from <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> nor <b>the</b> experimental phase speed increases around <b>the</b> shaker or <b>rib</b> locations;An energy-based model was derived that included the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> and attachment. <b>The</b> model used the Extended Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s Principle. Cubic spline weighting functions were applied via Galerkin 2 ̆ 7 s method of weighted residuals. This energy-based model did reproduce both the position and the magnitude of the peak in the sound radiation field from <b>the</b> <b>rib.</b> It also reproduced the phase speed increases around the shaker and <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> locations...|$|R

Theodoxus fluviatilis can be distinguished from the other three mentioned species by having a rib pit, which is formed by <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> and <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> shield. <b>The</b> <b>rib</b> shield, and consequently a rib pit, are lacking in Theodoxus transversalis, Theodoxus danubialis and Theodoxus prevostianus. These three species differs in having, in addition to a rib, a peg, which is absent in T. fluviatilis. The visible soft parts of the animal are light yellow with a black head. The tentacles are greyish and long. The eyes are large and black; the foot is whitish.|$|R
5|$|Turtles are {{notable for}} their {{protective}} shells. They have an inflexible trunk {{encased in a}} horny carapace above and a plastron below.

The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth {{have been replaced by}} sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.|$|E
5|$|Aetosauria {{was first}} named in 1889 by English naturalist Richard Lydekker and {{zoologist}} Henry Alleyne Nicholson. They considered Aetosauria {{to be one}} of three suborders of the order Crocodilia, the other two being Parasuchia (a Triassic group) and Eusuchia (a group including all post-Triassic crocodiles). At the time, Cope considered Aetosauria to belong to Rhynchocephalia, an order of reptiles that includes the living tuatara. He also thought that the tightly fitting osteoderms, which were thought to be fused to <b>the</b> <b>ribs,</b> indicated that aetosaurs were transitional between rhynchocephalians and turtles. Nicholson and Lydekker placed a single family within the suborder, Aëtosauridæ. They considered aetosaurs to be similar to living crocodilians apart from their elongated metatarsals, which were compared to those of dinosaurs. In fact, Marsh considered aetosaurs to be closely related to dinosaurs because both had similar metatarsals.|$|E
5|$|After the album's release, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a successful world tour that was once again filled with incidents. In late summer 2002, whilst the band were on tour in the US, Noel, Bell and touring keyboardist Jay Darlington {{were involved in a}} car accident in Indianapolis. While none of the band members sustained any major injuries, some shows were cancelled as a result. In December 2002, {{the latter half of the}} German leg of the band's European tour had to be postponed after Liam Gallagher, Alan White and three other members of the band's entourage were arrested after a violent brawl at a Munich nightclub.
