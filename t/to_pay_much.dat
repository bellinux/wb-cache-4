For the {{start of the}} Giro itself, the cities are willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> more money. The money the city and other investors put into get the start is quickly earned back. Former race director said that the cities often earn ten times the money they invested.|$|E
25|$|After Philip III's {{older brother}} Don Carlos died insane, Philip II had {{concluded}} {{that one of the}} causes of Carlos' condition had been the influence of the warring factions at the Spanish court. He believed that Carlos' education and upbringing had been badly affected by this, resulting in his lunacy and disobedience, and accordingly he set out <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> greater attention to arrangements for his later sons. Philip II appointed Juan de Zúñiga, then Prince Diego's governor, to continue this role for Philip, and chose García de Loaysa as his tutor. They were joined by Cristóbal de Moura, a close supporter of Philip II. In combination, Philip believed, they would provide a consistent, stable upbringing for Prince Philip, and ensure he avoided the same fate as Carlos. Philip's education was to follow the model for royal princes laid down by Father Juan de Mariana, focusing on the imposition of restraints and encouragement to form the personality of the individual at an early age, aiming to deliver a king who was neither tyrannical nor excessively under the influence of his courtiers.|$|E
25|$|On 1 April 1994, the Norwegian airline {{market was}} deregulated. Airlines {{no longer needed}} to apply for {{concession}} from the government, but could fly any route they wanted to. For the first time, several airlines could establish themselves on the same route. The exception was the state-subsidized regional routes, that would become subject to public service obligations (PSO) from 1 April 1997. Following the deregulation, Coast Air introduced a route from Bergen to Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik with a Jetstream 31. From 1995, the airline was forced <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> higher fees to the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration, following the decision that all commercial plans, also those under , should pay flight fees. In October, Coast Air was close to buying Air Stord, but the company was instead sold to Aker. In 1995, two new Jetstream 31 aircraft were delivered, and the Twin Otter aircraft were transferred to the new route between Stord and Stavanger. A third Jetstream was delivered the following year, and the Twin Otter {{was taken out of}} service.|$|E

25|$|Although the 1980s were {{chaotic and}} nomadic there were {{brighter}} sides {{to his life}} charted in his published diaries. In January 1978 he had met his second long-term partner Nicholas Balaban, who {{was working as a}} barman at the Sombrero Club in Kensington. With Clark's encouragement Balaban applied to the Byam Shaw School of Art and went on to start his own highly successful fashion business producing printed T-shirts for high-street boutiques and multiples. Although most published accounts choose not <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> attention to Clark's gay relationships his sexuality was predominantly homosexual. Unfortunately Clark's continued erratic behaviour eventually led to the relationship's collapse in 1983/84. His depression deepened even more as he obsessed over Balaban, trying unsuccessfully to rekindle the relationship. Only with Balaban's death from AIDS in 1994 and a conversion to Buddhism did Clark finally begin to rebuild a career and shake off the past. In the early 1990s he trained the designer Bella Freud to pattern-cut and an extremely promising new beginning was the use of Clark's mastery of pattern-cutting chiffon and delicate fabrics by the Ghost label. Clark found their computerised pattern cutter a revelation, able to turn initial ideas into formers almost instantaneously.|$|E

[...] Chris Reed of The Wall St. Cheat Sheet commented on the divisive opinions about PewDiePie, stating, [...] "PewDiePie is not universally adored [...] the great divide in opinion on PewDiePie seems to be largely generational.

2500|$|Martin J. Whitman {{is another}} well-regarded value investor. His {{approach}} is called safe-and-cheap, which was hitherto {{referred to as}} financial-integrity approach. Martin Whitman focuses on acquiring common shares of companies with extremely strong financial position at a price reflecting meaningful discount to the estimated NAV of the company concerned. Whitman believes it is ill-advised for investors <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> attention to the trend of macro-factors (like employment, movement of interest rate, GDP, etc.) {{because they are not}} as important and attempts to predict their movement are almost always futile.

2500|$|In a later {{report to}} Robertson (24 Dec) Haig {{accepted}} the blame, {{stating that the}} troops had been tired {{as a result of}} the attack on Bourlon Wood which he had ordered. Esher had warned Haig (28 October) that Rawlinson was criticising Charteris (known as [...] "the Principal Boy"), and reported that he had told Rawlinson that Charteris had [...] "no influence" [...] over Haig and his information had never let him down. Derby warned Haig (7 December) to sack Charteris, as the War Cabinet and General Staff were displeased at his exaggerated claims of German weakness. Haig took responsibility and defended Charteris. After the battle, the press baron Lord Northcliffe reduced his support of Haig. He had recently been offended on a visit to GHQ, when Haig had been too busy <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> attention to him. A Times editorial [...] "A Case for Inquiry" [...] (12 Dec) criticised Charteris for his [...] "fatuous estimates" [...] of German losses and morale and called for the sacking of [...] "every blunderer" [...] at GHQ. Haig assumed Lloyd George had inspired the article.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to economist Kaplan, {{the author and}} polemecist Matt Taibbi of Rolling Stone Magazine paints a less favorable portrait of Romney's business career (Taibbi also disparages Romney as “self-righteously anal, thin-lipped, [...] Whitest Kids U Know”). [...] According to Taibbi, {{toward the middle of}} his career at Bain Capital, Romney moved away from helping startups, and moved toward leveraged buyouts which involved borrowing money to take over established companies in order to extract as much value as possible from those targeted companies. [...] Taibbi calls this “financial piracy”, while acknowledging that Romney’s leveraged buyouts were not hostile takeovers, and also conceding that some of Bain’s work was not [...] "evil" [...] (such as Bain's successful turnaround of Experian). [...] Taibbi blames the U.S. tax code for making leveraged buyouts possible by allowing companies like Bain to deduct interest on debt they use to acquire targets, and also by allowing individuals like Romney <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> less than the ordinary tax rate on income. [...] However, the Wall Street Journal reports that Romney likely did not participate in the latter tax rate reductions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{foreign policy}} of the Republic of Vietnam (RVN), {{according}} to Fishel, [...] "to a very considerable extent", was the policy of Ngo Dinh Diem himself during this period. He was the decisive factor in formulating foreign policies of RVN, besides the roles of his adviser – Ngô Đình Nhu and his foreign ministers: Trần Văn Độ (1954–1955), Vũ Văn Mẫu (1955–1963) and Phạm Đăng Lâm (1963) who played subordinate roles in his regime. Nevertheless, since Diệm had <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> attention to domestic issues {{in the context of}} the Vietnam War, foreign policies did not receive appropriate attention from him. Diệm paid more attention to countries that affected Vietnam directly and he seemed to personalize and emotionalize relations with other nations. The issues Diệm paid more attention in foreign affairs were: the Geneva Accords, the withdrawal of the French, international recognition and the cultivation of legitimacy of RVN and the relations with the United States, Laos (good official relations) and Cambodia (complicated relations, especially in border disputes, minority ethnics), and especially North Vietnam. Besides, RVN also focused on the diplomatic relations with other Asian countries to secure its international recognition.|$|E

Shortly after entering high school, she becomes determined to find a boyfriend under the influence of all the shōjo manga she reads. She accidentally meets Yoh after a failed attempt at being [...] "picked up" [...] by guys. Shortly after that, she finds out Yoh goes to the same high school as Haruna and asks him to coach her on how to be attractive. After being rejected, she meets Asami, Yoh's sister and they become friends. Soon, Yoh reluctantly accepts to be Haruna's coach with one condition — she is not {{to fall in love with}} him. Yoh helps her daily with clothes and such, and gives her advice on what to do when she falls in love with one of Yoh's friends. Haruna can be described as simple-minded and doesn't seem <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> attention to her surroundings, though she is very kind hearted and cannot refuse anyone who needs help. Her friend once stated that she is [...] "pure-hearted to the point of being scary". She eventually ends up liking Yoh and they go out.|$|E
2500|$|Orbison {{continued}} recording albums in the 1970s, {{but none}} of them sold {{more than a handful of}} copies, and by 1976, he had gone an entire decade without a charting album. Aside from a few minor hits in Australia, he also failed to produce any charting singles after the '60s. His fortunes sank so low that he began to doubt his own talents and several of his '70s albums were not released internationally due to low US sales. He left MGM Records in 1973 and signed a one-album deal with Mercury Records. Author Peter Lehman would later observe that his absence was a part of the mystery of his persona: [...] "Since it was never clear where he had come from, no one seemed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> mind to where he had gone; he was just gone." [...] His influence was apparent, however, as several artists released covers of his songs, which proved popular. Orbison's version of [...] "Love Hurts", a song composed by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant and first recorded by the Everly Brothers, was remade by Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris, again by hard rock band Nazareth, and by blues adept Jim Capaldi. Sonny James sent [...] "Only the Lonely" [...] to No. 1 on the country music charts. Bruce Springsteen ended his concerts with Orbison songs, and Glen Campbell had a minor hit with a remake of [...] "Dream Baby". A compilation of Orbison's greatest hits went to No. 1 in the UK in January 1976. The same year, he began to open concerts for the Eagles, who started as Linda Ronstadt's backup band. Ronstadt herself covered [...] "Blue Bayou" [...] in 1977, her version reaching No. 3 on the Billboard charts and remaining in the charts for 24 weeks. Orbison credited this cover in particular for reviving his memory in the popular mind, if not his career. He signed again with Monument in 1976 and recorded [...] "Regeneration" [...] with Fred Foster, but it proved no more successful than before.|$|E
