5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E
25|$|The subject {{upon which}} you have written to me {{is one in which}} I {{naturally}} take a more than common interest. Not only was I one of the Oxford Crew in the first Inter-University Boat-Race in 1829, but the Race was entirely set up by me, owing to the fact that though I was myself at Christ Church, Oxford, my home was at Cambridge (my father being Master of Trinity), and I had a large acquaintance there, and some-times (especially in Easter vacations) was invited to pull in one of their boats, e. g. that of St John's, in which were the now Bishops, Selwyn and Tyrrell, and Charles Merivale the historian, all now vigorous and flourishing. I may also mention, as bearing upon your enquiry, that as soon as my father heard <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> chosen one of the Oxford Eight, and was practising for the Race, he wrote me an earnest letter, in which he desired me not to row any more, simply from anxiety lest my health should suffer. Though I was always much given to athletic exercises, even before I went to Harrow (where I was one of the Eleven in the first Matches against Eton, for four years, 1822 – 1825), my constitution was in some respects rather a delicate one. When I received his letter I went at once to my physician, told him the difficulty in which I was placed, begged him to examine my state of health, and got his authority to assure my father that so far as he could judge, rowing had not done me any harm. By this my father was satisfied, and I was allowed to go on. The Race itself, which was at Henley (two miles up stream), certainly did me no harm, though at the time I was incommoded by the change to an unusual diet, — under-done beefsteaks, porter, dry bread, no butter, no tea, no vegetables. After the Race, which was on Wednesday or Tuesday (I think), I was able to play cricket, as one of the Eleven also, against Cambridge on the following Friday. The match was at Oxford. We were victorious on both occasions.|$|E
500|$|Sherman {{proceeded}} {{to invade the}} state of Georgia with three armies: the 60,000-strong Army of the Cumberland under George Henry Thomas, the 25,000-strong Army of the Tennessee under James B. McPherson, and the 13,000-strong Army of the Ohio under John M. Schofield. He fought a lengthy campaign of maneuver through mountainous terrain against Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston's Army of Tennessee, attempting a direct assault only at the disastrous Battle of Kennesaw Mountain. In July, the cautious Johnston {{was replaced by the}} more aggressive John Bell Hood, who played to Sherman's strength by challenging him to direct battles on open ground. [...] Meanwhile, in August, Sherman [...] "learned <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> commissioned a major-general in the regular army, which was unexpected, and not desired until successful in the capture of Atlanta." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly afterwards, a Boston judge {{deemed the}} book obscene, and fined a {{librarian}} (who protested {{that she had}} a long queue of patrons waiting to borrow the book) US$100 for circulating it. Keable himself professed surprise at the intensity of the reaction to the book, saying that his missionary and military experiences must have [...] "blunted [...] perceptions as to what the general public felt." [...] In response to the banning in Boston of another of his books, Numerous Treasure, he wrote to his editor George Putnam that he had in the past month received fanmail from a bookseller, a request for his photograph from a girls' high school library, and [...] "an intimation <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> adopted as the literary patron of a class at an American university.

500|$|In August 2013, it was {{announced}} that it would reopen in October under a new chef-owner, Chris Harrod. Harrod had previously worked under Raymond Blanc at two Michelin starred restaurant Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons. He had been looking for a restaurant with rooms to purchase, having originally thought to look for one in the Chiltern Hills where they could be added. Harrod said that [...] "I went and had a look and was amazed to find that the Crown at Whitebrook ticked all the boxes for what I was looking for. It had the location, the quality suppliers and I knew straight away <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> looking in the wrong place." [...] The Crown at Whitebrook reopened the following October, and gained a new Michelin star under the new team in the 2014 list. In February 2015, the restaurant was renamed to The Whitebrook.|$|E
500|$|Modern-day {{historians have}} {{continued}} to characterize the battle as a wholesale massacre. Mark Grimsley, {{a history professor at}} Ohio State University, concluded in 2005, based on other modern accounts, that the Battle of Bad Axe would be better termed a massacre. Kerry A. Trask's 2007 work, Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America, points to the writings of Wakefield as evidence that delusional beliefs about doing brave deeds and magnifying manliness spurred the U.S. forces to revel in and pursue massacring and exterminating the Sauk and Fox. Trask concluded that Wakefield's statement [...] "I must confess, that it filled my heart with gratitude and joy, to think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> instrumental, with many others, in delivering my country of those merciless savages, and restoring those people again to their peaceful homes and firesides," [...] was a viewpoint held by nearly all militia members.|$|E

500|$|Astronomer Carl Sagan {{wrote in}} his book The Cosmic Connection that Clarke and Kubrick asked his opinion on how to best depict {{extraterrestrial}} intelligence. Sagan, while acknowledging Kubrick's desire to use actors to portray humanoid aliens for convenience's sake, argued that alien life forms were unlikely to bear any resemblance to terrestrial life, and that {{to do so would}} introduce [...] "at least an element of falseness" [...] to the film. Sagan proposed that the film suggest, rather than depict, extraterrestrial superintelligence. He attended the premiere and was [...] "pleased to see <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> of some help." [...] Kubrick hinted at the nature of the mysterious unseen alien race in 2001 by suggesting, in a 1968 interview, that given millions of years of evolution, they progressed from biological beings to [...] "immortal machine entities", and then into [...] "beings of pure energy and spirit"; beings with [...] "limitless capabilities and ungraspable intelligence".|$|E
500|$|The {{election}} {{took place}} on November 6, and Obama was projected the winner at about 11:14 pm Eastern Standard Time. [...] Romney garnered 206 electoral college votes to Obama's 332, losing {{all but one of}} nine battleground states, and 47percent of the nationwide popular vote to Obama's 51percent. Media accounts described Romney as [...] "shellshocked" [...] by the result. He and his senior campaign staff had disbelieved public polls showing Obama narrowly ahead, and had {{thought they were going to}} win until the vote tallies began to be reported on the evening of the election. [...] But Romney's get out the vote operation had been inferior to Obama's, both in person-to-person organization and in voter modeling and outreach technology (the latter exemplified by the failure of the Project Orca application). In his concession speech to his supporters, he said, [...] "Like so many of you, Paul and I have left everything on the field. We have given our all to this campaign. I so wish <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> able to fulfill your hopes to lead this country in a different direction, but the nation chose another leader." [...] Reflecting on his defeat during a conference call to hundreds of fundraisers and donors a week after the election, Romney attributed the outcome to Obama's having secured the votes of specific interest groups, including African Americans, Hispanic Americans, young people, and women, by offering them what Romney called [...] "extraordinary financial gifts." [...] The remark drew heavy criticism from prominent members of the Republican party.|$|E

Although <b>I</b> hesitate to use the word 2 ̆ 2 problem 2 ̆ 2 <b>I</b> feel <b>that</b> there is a tendency in teacher training for a student to latch onto one professor and model their teaching practices after that one mentor.

In this thesis, I propose to examine the widely varied experiences <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had here at VCU as a Teacher and Teaching Assistant.
