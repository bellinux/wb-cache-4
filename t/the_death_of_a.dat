5|$|Divorcing {{a spouse}} was {{permissible}} {{if there was}} mutual consent, while remarriage after <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spouse was common during the Song period. However, widows under post-Song dynasties did not often remarry, following the ethic of the Confucian philosopher Cheng Yi (1033–1107), who stated {{that it was better}} for a widow to die than lose her virtue by remarrying. Widows remarrying another after <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> first spouse did not become common again until the late Qing dynasty (1644–1912), yet such an action was still regarded as morally inferior.|$|E
