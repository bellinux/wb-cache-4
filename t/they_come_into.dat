5|$|Marasmius funalis {{mushrooms}} leave a white spore print. The individual basidiospores are ellipsoidal, {{and measure}} 6.5 to 8 by 4 to 5micrometres (μm). They have thin cell walls, {{and they are}} smooth and colourless. The spores are inamyloid, meaning {{that they do not}} stain when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> contact with iodine from Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The spores are borne on club-shaped basidia measuring 20 to 25 by 4.5 to 7μm, with two spores per basidium. There are also club-shaped basidioles (under-developed basidia).|$|E
5|$|The game's {{four stages}} {{take place in}} power plants, flats, {{underwater}} habitats, and space stations in zero gravity, respectively. Every level is an interior space, and consists of multi-storey rooms and corridors divided by interlocking lifts and doors. The player {{is equipped with a}} jet pack to reach higher areas and perform acrobatic manoeuvres such as backflips and rolls. They can also swim and dive underwater. Robots attack the player with shooting flames should <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> contact. Each stage ends with a boss battle, ranging from fire-breathing flowers to robotic fish.|$|E
5|$|The hybrid {{program has}} been criticized, with one of Sulimov's colleagues {{pointing}} out that in other tests the Laika performed {{just as well as}} the jackal hybrids. The assumption that dogs have lost some of their scent-detection ability may be incorrect, in that dogs {{need to be able to}} scent-detect and identify the many humans that <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> contact with in their domesticated environment. Another researcher crossed German Shepherds with wolves and claimed that this hybrid had superior scent-detection abilities. The scientific evidence to support the claims of hybrid researchers is minimal, and more research has been called for.|$|E

5|$|In {{most cases}} the {{electrons}} are close enough to thermal equilibrium that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even {{when there is a}} significant deviation from a Maxwellian energy distribution function, for example, due to UV radiation, energetic particles, or strong electric fields. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.|$|E
5|$|The {{edge of the}} gill is sterile, {{made up of a}} mass of cystidia (cheilocystidia). The {{club-shaped}} cheilocystidia measure from 10 to 25 by 7 to 12μm, {{and sport}} multiple cylindrical appendages on their tips, measuring 1 to 7 by 1 to 1.5μm. The cheilocystidia are colourless, with cell walls of variable thickness, and are inamyloid. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia {{on the face of the}} gills). The caulocystidia (cystidia in the stem) measure 60 to 200 by 4 to 7µm. They are cylindrical and erect, forming the visible bristles. The tip is either pointed or rounded, and the cell walls are smooth and colourless, up to 2µm thick. They are dextrinoid, meaning they stain a reddish-brown when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> contact with iodine from Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{usually are}} solitary foragers, {{although}} the northern giant mouse lemur {{tends to be}} the most social, possibly due to its higher population density. Up to eight (typically four) adult males, adult females, and juveniles may be found in a northern giant mouse lemur nest, whereas Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs do not nest communally, except when females share their nest with their offspring. Males do groom and call to females when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> contact, and according to radio-tracking and direct observations at Analabe near Kirindy, they form pair bonds, sometimes briefly traveling together during the dry season. However, most interactions between adults are infrequent and typically occur later at night and particularly during the dry season in overlapping core areas, often involving chases and other agonistic behavior, and only rarely social grooming. During the mating season, males act aggressively towards one another, pulling out fur around the head and shoulders and biting the head.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the launch}} of Halo Wars 2, a demo, {{featuring}} the campaign's opening mission and the Blitz Firefight mode, was released on the Xbox One and Windows. 343 Industries and Creative Assembly supported Halo Wars 2 post-release with additional content and updates. A multiplayer ranking system was withheld from the game at launch as the development team wanted to ensure that gameplay was as balanced as possible before its release. The post-release DLC included a campaign expansion, new units, new leaders, and new cards for the Blitz mode. The content was distributed {{on a monthly basis}} beginning in March 2017. On June 12, 2017, a campaign expansion titled Awakening the Nightmare was revealed. Players take control of the Banished as <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> conflict with parasitic alien life forms collectively known as the Flood. The expansion features new leaders, maps, and a new cooperative mode. It was released on September 26, 2017. In late October 2017, Halo Wars 2 received a number of visual enhancements for the Xbox One X. Additionally, cross-platform play between console and PC was enabled.|$|E
5|$|If an {{employee}} does {{make such a}} disclosure, Section 2 inserts a new Section 47B, providing that the employee shall suffer no detriment in their employment as a result. This includes both negative actions {{and the absence of}} action, and as such covers discipline, dismissal, or failing to gain a pay rise or access to facilities which would otherwise have been provided. If {{an employee}} does suffer a detriment, he is permitted to make a complaint before an employment tribunal under Section 3. In front of an employment tribunal, the law is amended in Sections 4 and 5 to provide compensation, and to reverse the burden of proof; if an employee has been dismissed for making a protected disclosure, this dismissal is automatically considered unfair. Similarly, under Section 6, an employee cannot be given priority when discussing redundancies simply because he made such a disclosure. These sections take into account Section 7, which notes that there is no requirement of age or length of employment before <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> effect.|$|E
5|$|Kirk {{reveals that}} the dinosaurs were brought to their time by an {{experiment}} he was running using his Third Energy technology. A rift in space was created and a pocket of the island from their time was exchanged with the same from the past, bringing dinosaurs back into their time. Kirk then tells them that if the reactors are set to overload, the energy coming from them and the vortex should {{cancel each other out}} if <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> contact. After Regina gets the stabilizer and initializer and uses them to overload the reactors, the energy shakes the base, causing a vent to fall on Gail allowing Kirk to get free again. The team heads towards the waterway to escape the blast, but Gail says they still need to capture the doctor. He starts to hobble away on his gun to go after Kirk, and orders Regina and Rick to leave without him if he does not return in thirty minutes. Regina is given the choice to either go after Dr. Kirk with Gail, or escape with Rick.|$|E

5|$|Most fungi grow as hyphae, {{which are}} cylindrical, thread-like {{structures}} 2–10µm {{in diameter and}} up to several centimeters in length. Hyphae grow at their tips (apices); new hyphae are typically formed by emergence of new tips along existing hyphae by a process called branching, or occasionally growing hyphal tips fork, giving rise to two parallel-growing hyphae. Hyphae also sometimes fuse when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> contact, a process called hyphal fusion (or anastamosis). These growth processes {{lead to the development}} of a mycelium, an interconnected network of hyphae. Hyphae can be either septate or coenocytic. Septate hyphae are divided into compartments separated by cross walls (internal cell walls, called septa, that are formed at right angles to the cell wall giving the hypha its shape), with each compartment containing one or more nuclei; coenocytic hyphae are not compartmentalized. Septa have pores that allow cytoplasm, organelles, and sometimes nuclei to pass through; an example is the dolipore septum in fungi of the phylum Basidiomycota. Coenocytic hyphae are in essence multinucleate supercells.|$|E
5|$|The player character, a boy scout, has {{approached}} a mansion {{looking for work}} during Bob a Job week. The door is answered by an old man wearing horn-rimmed glasses—the owner of the mansion. The man, a mad scientist, expresses surprise that the boy has managed {{to get past the}} guards and booby traps in the mansion's grounds. As the boy scout explains the reason for his visit, the scientist collapses, asking for his pills. At this point the game begins. The player must gather the 16 keys needed to unlock the safe and retrieve the scientist's pills before he passes away. During play the boy scout must negotiate the mansion's rooms, avoiding hazards and the mansion's staff, who have been told to protect the inventions within the mansion, using lethal force if necessary. The staff are unaware of the boy scout's purpose and will attack him should <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> contact.|$|E

There were also subsequent migrations, especially resulting from attempts of Safavids' to convert their subjects to Shia Islam in the sixteenth century. This added to the Parsi population and cemented their close association with Iran.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish fir (Abies pinsapo) {{is a true}} relic {{which has}} {{remained}} preserved in some mountain ranges around Málaga and Cádiz. Spanish firs {{are related to the}} North African spruce forests of the Yebala range, in Morocco. <b>They</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> contact with Algerian oak (Quercus canariensis) and other oak trees and sometimes even form mixed communities with these. Among the woody species also found in these forests are the hawthorn, barberry, butcher's broom (Ruscus aculeatus), Viburnum tinus, ivy, and Daphne laureola.|$|E

Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion {{as to how to}} achieve the result. The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states. When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have direct effect in national law against member states.|$|E
