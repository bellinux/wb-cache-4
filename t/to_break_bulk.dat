SIR, Having {{obligations}} to your family, which shall be nameless, and learning {{that you are}} one of the company of, adventurers doing business for the house of James and Company, late merchants in London, now in Dunkirk, I think it right to send you this early and private information, that the vessels you expected have been driven off the coast, without having been able <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>bulk,</b> or to land any part of their cargo; and that the west-country partners have resolved to withdraw their name from the firm, as it must prove a losing concern. Having good hope you will avail yourself of this early information, to do what is needful for your own security, I rest your humble servant, NIHIL NAMELESS.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1880s, {{the area}} was an {{important}} railroad and river terminus for cotton distribution, {{and a series of}} ferries facilitated movement of cargo and passengers from the island to the Illinois riverbank. The narrow gauge Texas and St. Louis Railway built into Bird's Point in 1882. When the remainder of the railroad was completed, it stretched from Bird's Point to Gatesville, Texas. An incline was used to transfer railcars onto car floats for the cross-Mississippi trip from Birds Point to Cairo, Illinois. The narrow-gauge Texas and St. Louis went bankrupt and the new company was the St. Louis Arkansas and Texas Railway. That railroad standard gauged the rail line so the railroads shippers would not have <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> by transferring to a different gauge railroad. When the St. Louis, Arkansas and Texas Railway went bankrupt it was taken over by the St. Louis Southwestern Railway, nicknamed the Cotton Belt. The railroad ran from Bird's Point through Pine Bluff, Arkansas, Texarkana, Texas and to Gatesville, Texas, offering planters a convenient route to transfer their cotton bales to the Mississippi for water transport to markets in the Midwest. The Cotton Belt moved most of its car ferry operations to a new incline and car float at Gray's Point, Missouri in 1898. In September 1908, the river bank caved in and essentially destroyed the boat yard and surrounding facilities. The railroad incline was destroyed in a flood in April 1909. The Cotton Belt continued to serve Birds Point with rail service for a number of years. The Cotton Belt 5.3 mile rail line between Birds Point and Wyatt, Missouri was abandoned by Interstate Commerce Commission order on October 9, 1938. In late 1941 an oil pipeline was laid on the old Cotton Belt right of way between Wyatt and Birds Point to facilitate the transportation of crude oil by barge. A small tank farm was built just south of Birds Point for oil storage. Cotton Belt handled railroad tank cars from Texas and Louisiana to Wyatt for shipment of the oil to Birds Point and trans loading onto barges.|$|E
40|$|Boundary {{conditions}} on an extra-dimensional interval can be chosen <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> gauge symmetries {{and to reduce}} the rank of the gauge group. We consider this mechanism in models with gauge trinification. We determine the boundary conditions necessary to break the trinified gauge group directly down {{to that of the}} standard model. Working in an effective theory for the gauge symmetry-breaking parameters on a boundary, we examine the limit in which the GUT-breaking sector is Higgsless and show how one may obtain the low-energy particle content of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. We find that gauge unification is preserved in this scenario, and that the differential gauge coupling running is logarithmic above the scale of compactification. We compare the phenomenology of our model to that of four-dimensional trinified theories. Comment: 22 pages, LaTeX, 2 eps figures (v 3 : discussion of mass scales clarified...|$|E
50|$|<b>Break</b> <b>bulk</b> cargo is {{typically}} material stacked on pallets and lifted {{into and out}} of the hold of a vessel by cranes on the dock or aboard the ship itself.

50|$|In the 1960s {{containerisation}} began <b>to</b> replace <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> as {{the main}} means of transporting cargo, dramatically reducing the need for waterfront labour.

50|$|Railway {{companies}} in their turn had trouble {{keeping up with}} the competition from motorised traffic, particularly trucks, vans and buses, in the 1920s. The national railroad company established the Algemeene Transport Onderneming (ATO; General Transport Company), which used both buses and trucks. The ATO was intended <b>to</b> transport <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> cargo from and to the railway stations, which had been Van Gend & Loos' market. In 1928, the national railway company took over Van Gend & Loos. The N.V. Expeditie Onderneming Van Gend & Loos switched to trucks, and grew significantly.|$|R
50|$|In 1875, the Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad (F&PM) began cross-lake {{shipping}} {{operations with}} the sidewheel steamer SS John Sherman.

2500|$|New Haven Harbor {{is home to}} the Port of New Haven, a deep-water seaport {{with three}} berths capable of hosting vessels and barges as well as the {{facilities}} required <b>to</b> handle <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> cargo. The port has the capacity to load 200 trucks a day from the ground or via loading docks. Rail transportation access is available, with a private switch engine for yard movements and private siding for loading and unloading.

50|$|Although a {{deviation}} {{is primarily}} {{a departure from the}} agreed route or the usual route, the concept of deviation extends beyond this. Deviation may include any unjustified delay such as remaining at authorised ports longer than necessary, or acting beyond the agreed scope of the voyage. For example, if a ship makes an authorised call at a port, but stays on <b>to</b> trade or <b>break</b> <b>bulk,</b> this action may amount to a deviation.|$|R
50|$|Brothers J.L. and G. Van den Boom {{registered}} the company Gebrs. Van den Boom in Rotterdam in 1857. They offered beurtvaart-like services to Helmond and Meppel with six sailing vessels. Shortly {{after the company}} started to offer services to Zutphen and Deventer. Another service was started between Amsterdam and Helmond. Next <b>to</b> the traditional <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> cargo of the beurtvaart, the brothers were able to attract larger customers and they became active as shipbrokers.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Wrap and Label" [...] {{program is}} another service {{provided}} to resellers.

50|$|Before the beurtvaart merchants {{had to hire}} {{an entire}} ship if they wanted {{something}} transported, although middlemen like shipbrokers probably saw <b>to</b> some <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> cargo as well. From {{the end of the}} 15th century wealth and trade were growing in the Netherlands, pushing the demand for transportation. Meanwhile, the cities increasingly involved themselves in regulating the transport business, primarily to advance their own skippers at the expense of those from other places. For instance, the right of lastbreken meant that a shipment of goods had to be unloaded upon arrival, involving fees for porters, warehouses and such. The medieval staple right is another example. As competing skippers would regularly get involved in fistfights over rights, shipments and times to load and sail, the cities made more and more rules and regulations.|$|R
50|$|The {{decrease}} in nickel {{concentration in the}} surface layer of nitinol is correlated with a greater corrosion resistance. A potentiodynamic test is commonly employed to measure a material’s resistance to corrosion. This test determines the electrical potential at which a material begins to corrode. The measurement is called the pitting or breakdown potential. After passivation in a nitric acid solution, Nitinol stent components showed significantly higher breakdown potentials than those that were unpassivated. In fact, there are many surface treatments that can greatly enhance the breakdown potentials of Nitinol. These treatments include mechanical polishing, electropolishing, and chemical treatments such as, Nitric Oxide submersion, etching of the raw surface oxide layer, and pickling <b>to</b> <b>break</b> down <b>bulk</b> material near the surface.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{stacking}} {{orientation of}} bilayers determines the polytype of SiC material. For {{the development of}} polytype heterojunctions a controlled switch from one stacking sequence to another is required. In the present paper it is demonstrated for 4 H-SiC and 6 H-SiC, that the chemical environment during preparation of the (√ 3 ×√ 3) R 30 ◦ reconstruction on SiC(0001) influences the bilayer stacking in the topmost surface region. A silicon rich growth environment results in three bilayers in identical orientation at the very surface, which {{in the case of}} 4 H-SiC corresponds <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> the <b>bulk</b> stacking sequence. Oxygen rich preparation conditions lead to a reduction to two identically oriented bilayers for both polytypes. The reconstruction geometry of the (√ 3 ×√ 3) R 30 ◦ phase is independent of the polytype and the terminating stacking sequence of the underlying material. In consequence, the surface stacking and as such the starting point of a polytype heterojunction can be taylored by the chemical potential...|$|R
40|$|The {{emerging}} {{field of}} silicon photonics seeks {{to unify the}} high bandwidth of optical communications with CMOS microelectronic circuits. Many components have been demonstrated for on-chip optical communications, including those that utilize the nonlinear optical properties of silicon[1, 2], silicon dioxide[3, 4] and silicon nitride[5, 6]. Processes such as second harmonic generation, which are enabled by the second-order susceptibility, have not been developed since the bulk χ^(2) vanishes in these centrosymmetric CMOS materials. Generating the lowest-order nonlinearity would open the window to a new array of CMOS-compatible optical devices capable of nonlinear functionalities not achievable with the?χ^(3) response such as electro-optic modulation, sum frequency up-conversion, and difference frequency generation. Here we demonstrate second harmonic (SH) generation in CMOS compatible integrated silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) waveguides. The χ^(2) response is induced in the centrosymmetric material by using the nanoscale structure <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the <b>bulk</b> symmetry. We use a high quality factor Q ring resonator cavity to enhance {{the efficiency of the}} nonlinear optical process and detect SH output with milliwatt input powers. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|One {{challenge}} of generating a liquid aerosol is finding an efficient way <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up <b>bulk</b> {{amounts of the}} compound into micron-sized droplets. Traditional methods of aerosol generation focus {{on the principle of}} creating the liquid droplets by blowing air at high speed over or through a liquid. In this study, a novel micropump droplet generator (MDG) is proposed based on a microfluidics device to produce monodisperse droplets on demand (DoD). The micropump design was employed to both pump the fluid into the air and to encourage droplet breakup and aerosol formation. Computational simulation modeling of the new MDG was developed and validated with comparisons to experimental data for current generators. The device was found to produce an aerosol similar to a vibrating orifice DoD device. Most importantly, the input power required by the newly proposed device (MDG) was several orders of magnitude below existing DoD generators for a similar droplet output. Based on the simulation results obtained in comparison with current DoD generators, the MDG device performed effectively at higher frequencies, smaller nozzle diameters, and regardless of the liquid viscosity of the solution...|$|R
