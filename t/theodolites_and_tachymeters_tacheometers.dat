50|$|Hilger & Watts was a {{well-known}} British manufacturing company that made <b>theodolites</b> <b>and</b> scientific instruments.|$|R
50|$|The {{invention}} of the telescope <b>and</b> the <b>theodolite</b> <b>and</b> the development of logarithm tables allowed exact triangulation and grade measurement.|$|R
50|$|He {{invented the}} polaristrobometer—a form of saccharimeter—a {{polarization}} photometer, a magnetic <b>theodolite,</b> <b>and</b> various new optical methods for comparing measures of length.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{the company}} {{produced}} scientific apparatus, including microscopes, heliostats, cathetometers, <b>theodolites</b> <b>and</b> arc lamps. Cabella {{took over the}} company in 1878 and the name became Ing. B. Cabella e C.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{paper of}} 1919 he drew {{attention}} to the advantage of using a <b>theodolite</b> <b>and</b> this was repeated in 'Transactions of the Institution of Mining Engineers' Vol. 60 of 1920 ...|$|R
5000|$|The company {{produced}} {{a range of}} precision microscopes and survey equipment including <b>theodolites</b> <b>and</b> it manufactured {{one of the first}} usable interference microscopes. A 1950 catalogue listed the following range of microscopes: ...|$|R
60|$|While he {{was thus}} occupied, the Professor {{assisted}} Lawrence in fixing the <b>theodolite,</b> <b>and</b> then, leaving him, {{went to a}} neighbouring heap of debris followed by the Captain, whom he stationed there.|$|R
30|$|The {{experimental}} {{analysis shows}} that this algorithm has the strong anti-interference ability in the actual application, which can improve the auto-focusing reliability of <b>theodolite</b> <b>and</b> that of other photoelectric equipments in a complex environment.|$|R
5000|$|Rankine's {{method is}} a {{technique}} for laying out circular curves {{by a combination of}} chaining and angles at circumference, fully exploiting the <b>theodolite</b> <b>and</b> making a substantial improvement in accuracy and productivity over existing methods.|$|R
50|$|In 1966 {{they used}} a <b>theodolite</b> <b>and</b> aneroid {{barometers}} to establish spot heights of mountain peaks between Brachina Gorge and Parachilna Gorge, in the Flinders Ranges. They also suggested Aboriginal names {{for many of the}} features.|$|R
50|$|In {{traditional}} {{mineral exploration}} and archaeological work, grid pegs placed by <b>theodolite</b> <b>and</b> tape measure {{were used to}} define the survey area. Some UXO surveys used ropes to define the lanes. Airborne surveys used radio triangulation beacons, such as Siledus.|$|R
2500|$|In 1849, Waugh {{dispatched}} James Nicolson to the area, {{who made}} two observations from Jirol, [...] away. Nicolson {{then took the}} largest <b>theodolite</b> <b>and</b> headed east, obtaining over 30 observations from five different locations, with the closest being [...] from the peak.|$|R
60|$|So saying, the man {{of science}} took a little line and plummet from his pocket, which he hung under the <b>theodolite,</b> <b>and</b> {{the spot where the}} plummet touched the ground was {{carefully}} marked by a small stake driven quite down to its head.|$|R
50|$|In 1849, Waugh {{dispatched}} James Nicolson to the area, {{who made}} two observations from Jirol, 190 km away. Nicolson {{then took the}} largest <b>theodolite</b> <b>and</b> headed east, obtaining over 30 observations from five different locations, with the closest being 174 km from the peak.|$|R
60|$|It did {{not take}} them long to {{traverse}} that space, and ere long, like the eagle and the sun, the whole party had retired to rest--the younger members, doubtless, to dreamless slumber; the Professor and the Captain, probably, to visions of <b>theodolites</b> <b>and</b> ice.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{a system}} for {{describing}} the three-dimensional geometry of trees and stands is presented. The system consists of two survey instruments, a <b>theodolite</b> <b>and</b> transit, and basic triangulation principles. A spotting laser has recently {{been added to the}} system to facilitate the spotting of the tree nodes to be surveyed" (p. ix). Results show significant differences in tree productivity as a result of fertilization and changes in heights, bole diameters, etc...|$|R
60|$|Of {{her father}} Gertrude knew even less. That {{he was a}} high-born English gentleman who had lived as a {{wanderer}} in many lands, this was all she knew. His only legacy to Gertrude had been a Russian grammar, a Roumanian phrase-book, a <b>theodolite,</b> <b>and</b> a work on mining engineering.|$|R
50|$|Leonard Digges (c.1515 - c.1559) was a {{well-known}} English mathematician and surveyor, {{credited with the}} invention of the <b>theodolite,</b> <b>and</b> a great populariser of science through his writings in English on surveying, cartography, and military engineering. His birth date is variously suggested as c.1515 or c.1520 (but certainly by 1530).|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of electronic surveying instruments, such as electronic <b>theodolites,</b> <b>and</b> concurrent advances in computer technology, has revolutionised engineering surveying; {{one of the}} more recent examples being the introduction of Electronic Theodolite Intersection Systems (ETISs). An ETIS consists of two or more electronic <b>theodolites</b> <b>and</b> a computer, with peripheral hardware and suitable software. The theoretical principles on which they are based have been known for a long time, but intersection has seldom been used as a method of measurement. The main reasons for its re-evaluation were the introduction of one-second electronic <b>theodolites</b> <b>and</b> the ability to interface these on-line to a computer. The last decade has seen the {{development of}} several commercially available systems and probably even more in-house developed systems. Such systems are capable of performing real-time, non-contact, three-dimensional coordinate determination to a high accuracy, enabling their use {{in a wide variety of}} applications. This thesis details all aspects of ETISs. Initially, the theoretical principles on which the systems are based are developed. The components of a system are then detailed and a review of current commercially available systems and their applications is given. The thesis then concentrates on the development of an ETIS by the author and details its' application in both industrial measurement and deformation monitoring. Finally, the thesis concludes with a discussion on the factors affecting the accuracies attainable with ETISs...|$|R

50|$|A similar {{procedure}} {{is applied to}} more sophisticated instruments such as a surveyor's level or a <b>theodolite</b> <b>and</b> {{is a matter of}} course each time the instrument is set up. In this latter case, the plane of rotation of the instrument is levelled, along with the spirit level. This is done in two horizontal perpendicular directions.|$|R
5000|$|Methods of {{examining}} exit jets include remote sensing and direct observation. SODAR and Doppler LIDAR {{have been used}} in numerous studies to identify, quantify and relate the jets to atmospheric transport of hazardous materials. [...] Detailed profiles of winds at canyon exits can be directly observed and calculated using a single or double <b>theodolite</b> <b>and</b> tethersondes.|$|R
50|$|Hood {{also gave}} {{an account of}} the diurnal {{variation}} of the magnetic needle and its correction, and a description of a new surveying instrument. This invention was elsewhere called Hood's compass <b>theodolite,</b> <b>and</b> is described as the basis of theodolites later used in Britain and America. He is also said to have anticipated the invention of Hadley's quadrant, but took out no patents.|$|R
50|$|The {{conflicting}} and unverified {{claims of}} Cook and Peary prompted Roald Amundsen to take extensive precautions in navigation during his Antarctic expedition {{so as to}} leave no room for doubt concerning his 1911 attainment of the South Pole, which (like Robert Scott's a month later in 1912) {{was supported by the}} sextant, <b>theodolite,</b> <b>and</b> compass observations of several other navigators. See Polheim.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "classical geodesy" [...] (up to the sixties) control {{networks}} {{was established}} by triangulation using measurements of angles and of some spare distances. The precise orientation to the geographic north is achieved through methods of geodetic astronomy. The principal instruments used are <b>theodolites</b> <b>and</b> tacheometers, which nowadays are equipped with infrared distance measuring, data bases, communication systems and partly by satellite links.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} eight such {{instruments}} were manufactured by Ramsden {{and others for}} use in Britain, India and Switzerland.Ramsden himself constructed three <b>theodolites</b> <b>and</b> a further two were completed to his design by Mathew Berge, his son-in-law and business successor, after Ramsden's death in 1805. Of the other instruments one was constructed by William Cary {{and the other two}} by the firm of Troughton and Simms.|$|R
50|$|Gunter's chain or the surveyor's chain (also {{known as}} Gunter’s {{measurement}} or surveyor’s measurement) is a distance measuring device used for land survey. It {{was designed and}} introduced in 1620 by English clergyman and mathematician Edmund Gunter (1581-1626) long before {{the development of the}} <b>theodolite</b> <b>and</b> other more sophisticated equipment, enabling plots of land to be accurately surveyed and plotted, for legal and commercial purposes.|$|R
5000|$|For precise {{calculation}} of survey networks. The geodetic <b>theodolites</b> <b>and</b> levelling instruments are oriented {{with respect to}} the true vertical, but its deflection exceeds the geodetic measuring accuracy by a factor of 5 to 50. Therefore, the data have to be corrected exactly with respect to the global ellipsoid. Without these reductions, the surveys may be distorted by some centimeters or even decimeters per km.|$|R
60|$|But within {{forty-eight hours}} {{the whole town}} knew that {{something}} was doing. The hotel swarmed with carpenters, bricklayers and painters. There was an architect up from the city with a bundle of blue prints in his hand. There was an engineer taking the street level with a <b>theodolite,</b> <b>and</b> a gang of navvies with shovels digging like fury as if to dig out the back foundations of the hotel.|$|R
60|$|After {{the first}} burst of enthusiasm and {{interest}} had abated, {{the attention of}} the party became engrossed in the proceedings of the Professor, who, with his assistants, began at once to adjust his <b>theodolite,</b> <b>and</b> fix stakes in the ice. While he was thus engaged, Captain Wopper regarded the Mer de Glace with a gaze of fixedness so intense as to draw on him the attention and arouse the curiosity of his friends.|$|R
60|$|So {{no wonder}} the town went wild! All day in the street you could hear men talking of veins, and {{smelters}} and dips and deposits and faults,--the town hummed with it like a geology class on examination day. And there were men about the hotels with mining outfits <b>and</b> <b>theodolites</b> <b>and</b> dunnage bags, and at Smith's bar they would hand chunks of rock up and down, some of which would {{run as high as}} ten drinks to the pound.|$|R
60|$|Of {{course there}} was a great deal of observing with the <b>theodolite,</b> <b>and</b> careful {{measuring}} as well as scrambling on the ice, similar to that of the previous day; but the end of the whole was that the glacier was ascertained to have flowed, definitely and observably down its channel, there could be no doubt whatever about that; the thing had been clearly proved, therefore the Professor was triumphant and the Captain, being a reasonable man, was convinced.|$|R
5000|$|He {{established}} {{the first official}} time service on his arrival in Perth. Using a chronometer <b>and</b> a borrowed <b>theodolite,</b> he determined an accurate solar time each night, clear skies permitting, and a time signal was telegraphed to the GPO at noon each day. In 1897 a small transit telescope replaced the <b>theodolite</b> <b>and</b> in about 1898 two standard German precision clocks were installed to track sidereal time and solar mean time. Several methods of broadcasting the time were used: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{instrument}} {{has been}} used {{since at least the}} time of ancient Egypt to ensure that constructions are [...] "", or vertical. It is also used in surveying, to establish the nadir with respect to gravity of a point in space. It is used with a variety of instruments (including levels, <b>theodolites,</b> <b>and</b> steel tapes) to set the instrument exactly over a fixed survey marker or to transcribe positions onto the ground for placing a marker.|$|R
