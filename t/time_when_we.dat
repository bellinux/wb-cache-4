5|$|Petre Vasiliu-Năsturel {{observes that}} from a heraldic point of view, on the French {{as well as the}} revolutionary Wallachian flag, the middle stripe {{represents}} a heraldic metal (argent and or respectively). Other writers believe that the tricolor was not an imitation of the French flag, instead embodying an old Romanian tradition. This theory is supported by a note from the revolutionary foreign minister to Emin Pasha: “the colors of the band that we the leaders wear, as well as all our followers, are not of modern origin. We have had our flags since an earlier <b>time.</b> <b>When</b> <b>we</b> received the tricolor insignia and bands we did not follow the spirit of imitation or fashion”.|$|E

We do not think it is fair to the court or counsel on the other side to waste a lot of <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> know this is the inevitable result and probably the best result for the case.|$|E

I think as fans we'd been waiting for it for so long. That said, {{it was a very}} difficult scene to shoot. Mainly because it was unusually hot over the two days we shot it, everyone was wearing heavy furs and armor, Kit was actually pretty ill and everyone was crammed into this space full of plates of sheep's tongues and chicken carcasses so it got quite smelly and sticky. It's also quite a long scene and yet Bella did it probably more than a hundred times, only forgetting a line once in the entire <b>time.</b> <b>When</b> <b>we</b> finished the scene she got a standing ovation from all the cast and crew." ...|$|E

[...] When asked whether this counts as the series tie-in to Guardians of the Galaxy, Whedon said [...] "It is a very far away other galaxy, so it's a little bit harder to have one of them walk into our set, so a direct tie-in is a little bit more challenging, but it's all one universe, so there's always opportunity for more. ... In Guardians, we saw parts in our universe that we hadn't explored yet, so it shows we're a part of that too."

500|$|Kruger {{presented}} the treaty to the volksraad on the triumvirate's behalf at Heidelberg on 15 April 1881. [...] "With {{a feeling of}} gratitude to the God of our fathers", he said, [...] "who has been near us in battle and danger, it is to me an unspeakable privilege to lay before you the treaty... I consider it my duty plainly to declare before you and the whole world, that our respect for Her Majesty the Queen of England, for the government of Her Majesty, and for the English Nation, has never been greater than at this <b>time,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are enabled {{to show you a}} proof of England's noble and magnanimous love for right and justice." [...] This statement was to be ignored by many writers, but Manfred Nathan, one of Kruger's biographers, stresses it as one of his [...] "most notable utterances". Kruger reaffirmed his faith in the royal commission of Wood, Sir Hercules Robinson and the Cape's Chief Justice Sir Henry de Villiers, who convened {{for the first time in}} Natal on 30 April, Brand with them as an adviser. The commissioners held numerous sessions in Pretoria over the following months with little input from Kruger, who was bedridden with pneumonia.|$|E
500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was at a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E
500|$|Biographers Morecambe and Stirling {{believe that}} Cary Grant was the [...] "greatest leading man Hollywood had ever known". Schickel stated {{that there are}} [...] "very few stars who achieve the {{magnitude}} of Cary Grant, art of a very high and subtle order", and {{thought that he was}} the [...] "best star actor there ever was in the movies". David Thomson and directors Stanley Donen and Howard Hawks concurred that Grant was the greatest and most important actor {{in the history of the}} cinema. He was a favorite of Hitchcock, who admired him and called him [...] "the only actor I ever loved in my whole life", and remained one of Hollywood's top box-office attractions for almost 30 years. Wansell wrote: [...] "To millions of movie-goers around the world, Cary Grant will forever epitomize the glamour, and the style, of Hollywood in its golden years. With his dark hair, and even darker eyes, mischievous smile and effortless elegance, he was, is, and always will be indelibly one of the great movie stars. Since his death in 1986, the incandescence of his screen image has not dimmed for a single moment".

Dev described the song as [...] "very flavorful" [...] and [...] "hot". In an interview with music blog Idolator, she talked in-depth about the conception of the song, stating, [...] "The idea behind 'In The Dark' was {{for me to make}} a sexy song. I'm a grown woman now. I've been working with The Cataracs {{for the past three years}} and I met them when I was kind of young and from a small town. I was like, dammit, I'm gonna make a sexy song! So that's what I did." [...] She explained that she wanted the song to be [...] "tasteful, yet sexual" [...] and described it as [...] "very sexy, but very musical at the same time". She said, [...] "The songs I had before, even though they were explicit to an extent, they were just fun. It was <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> just wanted to make that sort of record, and we did. It's probably one of the sexier songs on the record, but I think it needed that!" [...] "In the Dark" [...] was recorded during a session in January 2011; it was one of the first songs to be recorded for Dev's debut album and it was eventually also recorded by Demi Lovato. It was later mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Studios in Los Angeles, California and mastered by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound in New York City.|$|E
500|$|Jocelyn Vena from MTV News {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review, writing [...] " [...] {{has found a}} chart-topping formula, combin killer beats with lyrics about super-fun parties and hot pants." [...] Vena commented that, although the song was not groundbreaking and did not stray {{too far away from}} previous singles [...] "Tik Tok" [...] or [...] "Take It Off", that hardly matters as [...] "it's another uber-fun tune about how awesome it is to dance the night away" [...] with an [...] "inspired [...] the recent rash of suicides among gay youth." [...] Jason Lipshutz from Billboard gave the song a positive review; he praised Dr. Luke's production and the song's chorus. Lipshutz commented on the song's similarity to [...] "Tik Tok", writing, [...] "Instead of straying from the 'TiK ToK' formula, 'We R Who We R,' ... smartly maximizes [...] most appealing qualities." [...] The review concluded that the song [...] "demonstrates that [...] still has mileage left in her electro-pop sound as she gears up for her next album." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "companion piece" [...] to Pink's [...] "Raise Your Glass" [...] citing their similar subject matter and close releases. Nitsuh Abebe from NY Magazine complimented the song's chorus and trance pop elements. Abebe wrote that the song embodied a [...] "hollowed-out, free-of-yourself feeling", commenting that almost all electronic dance music imbues feelings [...] "that are almost spiritual, that sense of being subsumed and out-of-body". Melinda Newman of HitFix called the song [...] "incredibly stupid, but it has the main ingredients to make it a global hit: an insistent beat and positive lyrics that promise to suspend time and keep us 'forever young,' or better yet, transport us back to a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> felt like we were." [...] Newman referred to herself as one of the singer's biggest detractors, but wrote [...] "I like one of her songs--or at least begrudgingly admire its crass charms."
