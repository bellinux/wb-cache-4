5|$|The {{next year}} in 1934 at Alcatraz Island, Ladd Russo befriends Firo, who was framed by fellow Immortal Victor Talbot for the Mist Wall public bombing and Isaac, who was finally caught for his thefts, leaving Miria morose from his arrest. All three men meet Huey Laforet in {{separate}} occasions, who was charged with treason and conspiracy years ago with affiliation to the Lemures among other terrorist acts. Meanwhile, Christopher Shouldered, Huey's homunculus, and Graham Specter, Ladd's loyal follower, cause an all out war in Chicago through various battles enacted by the Lamia, Nebula and the Russo family led by a now immortal Placido Russo with each battling for their lives. Afterwards, Jacuzzi and his gang return to Chicago while Ladd attempts to kill Huey and fails thanks {{to the efforts of}} Isaac, Firo and Chane's homunculus sister, Leeza Laforet; however, the scuffle resulted in Huey's eye taken with the help of Lamia operative Sham, a homunculus who can take over one's consciousness by contact <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> in the form of water. The homunculus group Lamia (associated with Larvae, the group previously encountered by the cast in 1933) cause trouble for the Russo family while this happens. Several of the Lamia join their forces and others split after the conflict, particularly Christopher joining with the Russo family to protect the androgynous heir Ricardo Russo along with Lamia member Sickle and Graham Spector. Isaac is eventually released from Alcatraz along with Firo after fulfilling their mission. Placido Russo, Ricardo's grandfather and Ladd's uncle, is eventually turned immortal and consumed by Nebula scientist Renee for his failure in stopping the rampage of Chicago, resulting in Ricardo inheriting the crime family.|$|E

Shrapnel tore <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>body,</b> damaging a shoulder, breaking an arm, fracturing facial bones and collapsing his lungs. The blast also drove the frame of his protective eyewear into his face.|$|E

25|$|States {{similar to}} {{suspended}} animation also appear in medieval romances, {{such as the}} Histora Destructionis Troiae and the Roman d’Eneas.

This fluid kept the corpse of Hector preserved as if he was still alive, maintaining him in a persistent vegetative state during which autonomic processes such as the growth of facial hair continued.|$|E
25|$|Some {{days after}} the find was {{revealed}} a local farmer (Karl Andersson) told Albert Sandklef of a legend he had heard as a child. Two old people from Åkulla had told his father {{about a man who}} was recruiting soldiers in the area. He had been killed by the peasants and buried in a bog. He would start haunting late at night, and in order to stop this, poles were struck <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>body,</b> whereafter the haunting stopped. As far as the farmer could remember they mentioned Store Mosse, a bog about 10 miles from the find, close to Nackhälle village, though he acknowledged that his memory might fail him as he had grown up in the vicinity of that bog.|$|E
25|$|Marulaz {{received}} {{promotion to}} Chef de brigade (colonel) of the 8th Hussars on 28 December 1798 {{in time for}} the War of the Second Coalition. He fought in the First Battle of Zurich on 4 June 1799, the 8th Hussars being attached to the 7th Division. On 15 June he led a successful raid on an enemy camp, capturing 400 men. He was shot five times, including one ball that passed right <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> from side to side, breaking two ribs. At the start of Jean Moreau's 1800 campaign, the 8th Hussars belonged to Dominique Vandamme's division of Claude Lecourbe's corps. This division fought at the battles of Stockach and Messkirch in April 1800. During the Battle of Hohenlinden campaign that fall, the 8th Hussars were assigned to Charles Gudin's division and fought at Salzburg on 14 December 1800.|$|E

25|$|After Queen Marie-Thérèse's {{death in}} 1683 and the king's secret {{marriage}} to Mme de Maintenon, devotion {{came to the}} fore at court. The king's enthusiasm for opera dissipated; he was revolted by Lully's dissolute life and homosexual encounters. In 1686, to show his displeasure, Louis XIV made a point of not inviting Lully to perform Armide at Versailles. Lully died from gangrene, having struck his foot with his long conducting staff during a performance of his Te Deum to celebrate Louis XIV's recovery from surgery. He refused to have his leg amputated so he could still dance. This resulted in gangrene propagating <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> and ultimately infecting the greater part of his brain, causing his death. He died in Paris and was buried in the church of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, where his tomb with its marble bust can still be seen. All three of his sons (Louis Lully, Jean-Baptiste Lully fils, and Jean-Louis Lully) had musical careers as successive surintendants of the King's Music.|$|E
25|$|Snape's {{memories}} then {{reveal that}} Dumbledore had impetuously {{tried to use}} the Gaunt ring which had been cursed by Voldemort, and had been suffering from a powerful curse. Snape's knowledge of the Dark Arts enabled him to slow {{the spread of the}} curse from Dumbledore's hand <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>body,</b> but he would have died within a year. Dumbledore, aware that Voldemort had ordered Draco to kill him, had asked Snape to kill him instead as a way of sparing the boy's soul and of preventing his own otherwise slow, painful death. Although Snape was reluctant, even asking about the impact of such an action on his own soul, Dumbledore implied that this kind of coup de grâce would not damage a human's soul in the same way murder would. Snape agreed to do as the Headmaster requested. Snape's memories also provide Harry with the information he needs to ensure Voldemort's final defeat, in the form of conversations Snape had with Dumbledore.|$|E

As Lennon had been shot four times at close range with hollow-point bullets, Lennon's affected organs (particularly his left lung) and major blood vessels above his heart were virtually destroyed upon impact. Lynn later stated to reporters on the extent of Lennon's injuries: [...] "If he [...] had been shot this way {{in the middle of the}} operating room with a whole team of surgeons ready to work on him... he still wouldn't have survived his injuries".|$|E

500|$|Having {{finished}} work early, Parker and Toms were walking {{to visit her}} friend's house when they were confronted by a gang of around ten Pakistani youths, {{some of whom were}} wearing balaclavas; the 2002 trial judge concluded that they had planned to find [...] "a white male to attack simply because he was white" [...] in the context of [...] "hostility {{on the part of some}} of the younger white residents of the city against the Asian community". They warned Parker he had [...] "better start running", but then blocked his path and quickly sprayed him in the face with CS gas. He was punched in the stomach then stabbed three times from behind through the throat and chest with a foot-long hunting knife. The knife penetrated completely <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> on two occasions and as he was lying on the ground he was repeatedly kicked and struck with a panel beater's hammer.|$|E
500|$|Dr. George Goodfellow testified about Billy Clanton's wounds at the Spicer hearing. He {{stated that}} {{the angle of the}} wrist wound {{indicated}} that Billy's hand could not have been raised over his head as claimed by Cowboy witnesses. In his coroner's report, Mathews did not mention Billy's arm wound, but witness Keefe, who examined the arm closely, testified later that Clanton was shot through the right arm, close to the wrist joint and [...] "the bullet passed through the arm from [...] "inside to outside," [...] entering the arm close {{to the base of the}} thumb, and exiting [...] "on the back of the wrist diagonally" [...] with the latter wound larger. This indicated to the judge that Billy could not have been holding his coat's lapels open, his arms raised, as the Cowboys testified. Dr. Mathews found two other wounds on Billy's body. The first was two inches from Clanton's left nipple, penetrated his lung. The other was in the abdomen beneath the twelfth rib, six inches to the right of the navel. Both were fired from the front. Neither passed completely <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>body.</b> The wound to Billy Clanton's right wrist may have been inflicted by Morgan Earp or Doc Holliday immediately at the outset of the fight as Billy was drawing his gun.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the lead}} player character, Martin Walker, was {{designed}} to be as simple as possible in order to help players to engage in the game, and relate to the character, the team gave him some personality which was expressed <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> language and his reactions during the game's battles. It was felt that by reflecting his emotions to players, they would share them. The squad was designed so that room was left for character development. The transformation of the squad's mentality serves as an important plot device during the game and has a significant narrative context. The changes in the cleanliness of their clothing, and their reactions toward each other, help to illustrate the story. According to Williams, the hope was that players would start the game with relatively low expectations, or they would consider the game another typical heroic war shooter, then by seeing the transformation of the characters, would be shocked by the game's narrative and be [...] "engulfed by the darkness". To make the transformation process clear, the team found it necessary to show the characters' personality {{at the beginning of the}} game in order to create a strong contrast. Gameplay is also a plot device and is tied to the game's narrative, as players can choose whether or not to execute enemies, which reflects the brutality and horror of war.|$|E
