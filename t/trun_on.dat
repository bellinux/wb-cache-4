5|$|Although {{the first}} day's {{progress}} was slower than expected, Operation Tractable resumed on 15 August; both armoured divisions pushed southeast toward Falaise. The Canadian 2nd and 3rd Infantry Divisions—with {{the support of}} the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade—continued their drive south towards the town. After harsh fighting, the 4th Armoured Division captured Soulangy but the gains made were minimal as strong German resistance prevented a breakthrough to <b>Trun.</b> <b>On</b> 16 August, the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division broke into Falaise, encountering minor opposition from Waffen-SS units and scattered pockets of German infantry. Although it would take two more days to clear all resistance in the town, the first major objective of Operation Tractable had been achieved. Simonds began to reorganize the bulk of his armoured forces for a renewed push towards Trun to close the Falaise Pocket.|$|E

5|$|The {{drive for}} Trun by Polish and Canadian Armoured Divisions began on 16 August, with {{preliminary}} attacks {{in preparation for}} an assault against <b>Trun</b> and Chambois. <b>On</b> 17 August, both armoured divisions of the Canadian 1st Army advanced. By early afternoon, the Polish 1st Armoured Division had outflanked the 12th SS Panzer Division, enabling several Polish formations to both reach the 4th Armoured Division's objectives and significantly expand the bridgehead northwest of Trun. Stanisław Maczek—the Polish divisional commander—split his forces into three battlegroups each of an armoured regiment and an infantry battalion. One of these struck southwest, cutting off Trun and establishing itself on the high ground dominating {{the town and the}} Dives river valley, allowing for a powerful assault by the Canadian 4th Armoured Division <b>on</b> <b>Trun.</b> The town was liberated on the morning of 18 August.|$|R

500|$|Some {{historians have}} thought that the gap could have been closed earlier; Wilmot wrote that despite having British {{divisions}} in reserve, Montgomery did not reinforce Guy Simonds and that the Canadian drive <b>on</b> <b>Trun</b> and Chambois was not [...] "vigorous and venturesome" [...] as the situation demanded. Hastings wrote that Montgomery, having witnessed {{what he called a}} poor Canadian performance during Totalize, should have brought up veteran British divisions to take the lead. D'Este and Blumenson wrote that Montgomery and Harry Crerar might have done more to impart momentum to the British and Canadians. Patton's post-battle claim that the Americans could have prevented the German escape, had Bradley not ordered him to stop at Argentan, was [...] "absurd over-simplification".|$|R
