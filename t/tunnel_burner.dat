40|$|The noise {{generated}} {{during the}} operation of large blowdown wind tunnels is considered. Noise calculation procedures are given to predict the test-section overall and spectrum level noise caused by both the <b>tunnel</b> <b>burner</b> and turbulent boundary layer. External tunnel noise levels due to the <b>tunnel</b> <b>burner</b> and circular jet exhaust flow are also calculated along with their respective cut-off frequency and spectrum peaks. The predicted values are compared with measured data, {{and the ability of}} the prediction procedure to estimate blowdown-wind-tunnel noise levels is shown...|$|E
40|$|The conical <b>tunnel</b> <b>burner</b> is an {{improvement}} of the cylindrical <b>tunnel</b> <b>burner</b> because, by maintaining all its advantages by means of burning intensification, it may also insure the flame stabilization {{in a wide range}} of regulation with considerable diminished pressure losses. Technical applications for the conical furnace burner can vary due to the limited dimensions required by the system, as well as the important thermal loads, and also because of the burning stability characteristic that spreads over an important range of regulation. The low costs required by the burner, generated mainly by its simple construction, also raise the interest for this technical solution. A physical model is proposed for the ignition and flame front stabilization. The flame front stabilization contains different steps from the ignition moment to final flame front stabilization, with specific flame front geometries and specific locations along the burner axis. The installation realised by the authors allowed the experimental study of the burning process in conical furnaces, in order to determine the temperature fields and the flame profiles. The physical model developed for this new type of application and the experimental data sets obtained (along with their interpretation) make the subject of this paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{combustion}} process occurring in industrial gas burners {{is controlled by}} physical phenomena such as turbulent flow, the mixing of fuel and air, and radiative and convective heat transfer from the flame, {{as well as the}} chemical processes governing the conversion of fuel and air to combustion products. Several numerical computer models which simulate these processes are now available. This paper describes the basis of such modelling techniques, and illustrates their potential by presenting simulations of the combustion of natural gas in a <b>tunnel</b> <b>burner</b> carried out using the FLUENT flow simulation software package. This package uses modern computing techniques, in particular the finite difference method, to solve the equations which describe the {{combustion process}}. The numerical methods used in FLUENT provide solutions at distinct points in space through the repeated application of software routines which start with guessed or estimated initial values and progress systematically toward the required solution. ...|$|E
