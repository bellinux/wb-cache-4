By this time, Serb officers and soldiers were also deserting in significant numbers.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, Loxton {{also became}} more disillusioned with cricket, as player {{behaviour}} deteriorated and incidences of verbal hostility and altercations increased. The former all-rounder {{was known for}} his vigorous advocacy of the more sedate and gentlemanly conduct that existed during his playing days and felt <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> fellow administrators were losing control of the sport.|$|E
5|$|In June 1874, Clayton {{announced}} that {{he could no longer}} control matters in Arkansas and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> friends would be willing to enter into any arrangement whereby they could at least be safe from persecution and prosecution. However, the Democrats retaliated by impeaching many Minstrels, including Supreme Court Justice John McClure. Clayton finished his Senate term but was not re-elected.|$|E

The partners would open several law offices around the Taranaki region.|$|E

5|$|After Applewhite's release, he {{traveled}} to California and Oregon with Nettles, eventually gaining a group of committed followers. Applewhite and Nettles told their followers {{that they would be}} visited by extraterrestrials who would provide them with new bodies. Applewhite initially stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> followers would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed, but later, he came to believe that their bodies were the mere containers of their souls, which would later be placed into new bodies. These ideas were expressed with language drawn from Christian eschatology, the New Age movement, and American popular culture.|$|E
5|$|As {{the senator}} {{discussed}} their finances, the telecast again showed Pat Nixon, fixedly watching her husband. Pat Nixon later stated that her rapt gaze {{was because she}} did not know exactly what he would say, and wanted to hear. Nixon detailed their assets and liabilities: the mortgaged home in Washington; the similarly mortgaged home in California, then occupied by his parents. The loans from his parents and from Riggs Bank. The borrowed-against life insurance policy on the senator; no insurance on his wife or children. The two-year-old Oldsmobile and the family furniture, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wife owned no stocks or bonds.|$|E

50|$|The Robinson {{family history}} {{indicates}} Landon Carter, Jr. (1738 - 1801) was his father, which seems quite {{likely due to}} the special status <b>that</b> both <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> mother held on the plantation.|$|R
5|$|Black Hawk was {{determined}} to hold onto Saukenuk, where he lived and had been born. When the Sauks returned to the village in 1829 after their annual winter hunt in the west, they found {{that it had been}} occupied by white squatters who were anticipating the sale of land. After months of clashes with the squatters, the Sauks left in September 1829 for the next winter hunt. Hoping to avoid further confrontations, Keokuk told Forsyth <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> followers would not return to Saukenuk.|$|E
5|$|By 221 Elagabalus' eccentricities, {{particularly}} {{his relationship with}} Hierocles, increasingly provoked the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard.

As alternatives, {{she turned to her}} other daughter, Julia Avita Mamaea, and her daughter's son, the thirteen-year-old Severus Alexander.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, {{the house}} saw {{service as a}} {{depository}} for the evacuated Wallace Collection and a convalescent home. A troop of gunners occupied the decaying service wing, and the park {{was used for the}} inflation of barrage balloons. During this turmoil, the Dashwoods retreated to the upper floor and took in lodgers to pay the bills, albeit very superior lodgers, who included Nancy Mitford and James Lees-Milne, who was secretary of the Country House Committee of the National Trust and instrumental in the Trust's acquisition of many such houses. In 1943, Sir John gave the house and grounds to the National Trust, on condition <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> descendants could continue living in the house.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Dexagoridas, {{one of the}} two {{garrison}} commanders, {{sent word}} to the Roman legate {{that he was willing to}} surrender the city. This plan fell through when Gorgopas, the other commander, learned of it and slew Dexagoridas with his own hands. Gorgopas continued to resist fiercely until Flamininus arrived with 4,000 additional troops that he had recently recruited. The Romans renewed their assault and Gorgopas was forced to surrender, though he did secure the condition <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> garrison could leave unharmed and return to Sparta.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain {{secured the}} {{territory}} in 1763 after their victory over France in the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War, {{better known as}} the French and Indian War in North America; lasting from 1754 to 1763. The founding of the first agricultural community and settlements in 1812 by Lord Selkirk, north of the area which is now downtown Winnipeg, led to conflict between British colonists and the Métis. Twenty colonists, including the governor, and one Métis were killed in the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816. Thomas Spence attempted to be President of the Republic of Manitobah in 1867, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> council named.|$|E

5|$|Grimsby's ageing {{team made}} a bright start in 1952–53 with five {{straight}} wins but eventually slipped and finished in fifth place. In 1953–54, Shankly became disillusioned when the board {{could not give}} him money to buy new players. He was reluctant to promote some promising reserves because of loyalty to the older players (a fault that was to resurface at Liverpool years later) and he finally resigned in January 1954, citing the board's lack of ambition as his main reason. In his autobiography, he said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wife were feeling homesick in Grimsby and, when an opportunity came to manage Workington, he was attracted to the challenge partly because they would be closer to Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Gröning {{claims that}} this {{disrupted}} the relative tranquility his job gave {{him and he}} claims he yet again complained to his superior. His boss, an SS-Untersturmführer, listened but {{reminded him of the}} pledge <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> comrades made. Gröning thus returned to work. He has declared that he manipulated his life at Auschwitz so as to avoid witnessing the camp's most unpalatable aspects.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Molly Kronberg, {{widow of}} Kenneth Kronberg, sued LaRouche {{in federal court}} for the Eastern District of Virginia, in Alexandria, alleging <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> {{associates}} libelled and harassed her on account of her compelled testimony in the 1988 case which led to his conviction. LaRouche alleges that Kronberg perjured herself and colluded with the prosecutors to frame him in order to cover up a bad check issued in 1979 by her from a New Benjamin Franklin House Publishing Company account for royalties owed him. One of the prosecutors in the 1988 case, John Markham, is representing Kronberg in the suit.|$|E
