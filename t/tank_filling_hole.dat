40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{a study of}} inner-tank sloshing effect on motion responses of a Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) system, through experimental analysis and numerical modeling. To investigate hydrodynamic characteristics of FLNG under the conditions of with and without LNG-tank sloshing, a series of numerical simulations were carried out using potential flow solver SESAM. To validate the numerical simulations, model tests on the FLNG system was conducted in both liquid and solid ballast conditions with 75 % <b>tank</b> <b>filling</b> level in height. Good correlations were observed between the measured and predicted results, proving the feasibility of the numerical modeling technique. On the verified numerical model, Response Amplitude Operators (RAOs) of the FLNG with 25 % and 50 % <b>tank</b> <b>filling</b> levels were calculated in six degrees of freedom. The influence of tank sloshing with varying <b>tank</b> <b>filling</b> levels on the RAOs has been presented and analyzed. The results showed that LNG-tank sloshing has a noticeable impact on the roll motion response of the FLNG and a moderate <b>tank</b> <b>filling</b> level is less helpful in reducing the roll motion response...|$|R

50|$|An {{exercise}} in {{learning how to}} build discrete-rate simulations is to model a <b>tank</b> <b>filling</b> and emptying over time. The <b>tank</b> <b>fills</b> at a constant rate and empties at two different rates, one rate until it is full and a faster rate until it is empty. There are 4 types {{of events in the}} simulation: start simulation, storage full, storage empty, and end simulation. At each event the model determines which emptying rate to use; between events the emptying rate remains constant.|$|R

An hydraulic tanker requires a larger volume of void space for buoyancy than conventionally loaded tanks, because the empty, or ballasted, condition of <b>tanks</b> <b>filled</b> with water is heavier than the loaded condition of <b>tanks</b> <b>filled</b> with oil. A heavier ballasted condition may also increase round trip fuel consumption.|$|R

A synthesis is coherent if every local neighborhood of the <b>filled</b> <b>hole</b> is similar to some local neighborhood of the input mesh.

Escape of the powder during FSP is less in <b>holes</b> <b>filling</b> method {{compared with that of}} groove <b>filling</b> method. Similarly, <b>holes</b> <b>filling</b> and closing method gives more control over the particle incorporation compared with that of groove <b>filling</b> and <b>holes</b> <b>filling</b> methods but requires more operations. For applications, where more quantity is not necessary but slight modification is enough to alter the surface properties, simple groove filling method or groove filling and closing method can be adapted. Groove filling method is also appropriate to obtain thick composite layers compared with other processes as shown in Table  1. Of course, the thickness of a composite layer depends on the FSP tool pin dimensions and processing parameters. Where applications demand more amount of secondary phase at the surface, <b>holes</b> <b>filling</b> or <b>holes</b> <b>filling</b> and closing method can be chosen.|$|R
