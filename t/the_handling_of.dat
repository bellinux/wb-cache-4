40|$|This thesis {{encompasses}} {{an experimental}} research study done {{as part of}} an honors program. The study aims to explore infants' knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> <b>of</b> tools by examining their grasping and anticipation behaviors. Infants must learn how to use many tools in order to engage in a variety of daily tasks. An unpublished pilot study in our lab suggests that 6. 5 to 8. 5 -month-old infants fixated more on <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> a familiar tool than 3 - to 5 -month-olds (Hirtle, Strouse, Borten, & Needham, 2007). The current study aimed to extend this prior research by also obtaining measures of infants’ grasping behaviors on tools. Infants were more likely to make anticipations of the hand reaching for <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peeler than <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spoon, and {{were also more likely to}} make anticipations of the hand reaching for the usable portion of the spoon than <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spoon. The only reliable predictor of infants’ first grasp location on the tools was age, with 12. 5 -month-olds more reliably grasping <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> an adult spoon. Results are discussed in terms of the experiences they have had with these tools and how they interpret those experiences.

5|$|Because sugars burn easily {{when exposed}} to flame, <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> sugars risks dust explosion. The 2008 Georgia sugar {{refinery}} explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, and destroyed most of the refinery, {{was caused by the}} ignition of sugar dust. In its culinary use, sugar that is exposed to a heat source causes caramelization to take place. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.|$|E
