40|$|<b>Triaxial</b> <b>tests</b> are {{essential}} to estimate the shear strength properties of the soil or rock. Normally <b>triaxial</b> <b>tests</b> are carried out on samples of 38 mm diameter and 76 mm height. Granular materials, predominantly used in base/sub-base construction of pavements or in railways have size range of 60 - 75 mm. Determination of shear strength parameters of those materials can be made possible only through <b>triaxial</b> <b>tests</b> on large diameter samples. This paper describes a large diameter cyclic <b>triaxial</b> <b>testing</b> facility {{set up in the}} Geotechnical Engineering lab of Indian Institute of Science. This setup consists of 100 kN capacity dynamic loading frame, which facilitates testing of samples of up to 300 mm diameter and 600 mm height. The loading ram can be actuated up to a maximum frequency of 10 Hz, with maximum amplitude of 100 mm. The setup is capable of carrying out static as well as dynamic <b>triaxial</b> <b>tests</b> under isotropic, anisotropic conditions with a maximum confining pressure of 1 MPa. Working with this setup is a difficult task because {{of the size of the}} sample. In this paper, a detailed discussion on the various problems encountered during the initial testing using the equipment, the ideas and solutions adopted to solve them are presented. Pilot experiments on granular sub-base material of 53 mm down size are also presented...|$|R

After his graduation from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, Bishop worked under Alec Skempton and obtained his PhD in 1952 with his thesis title being: The stability of earth dams.

50|$|The <b>triaxial</b> <b>test</b> {{can be used}} to {{determine}} the shear strength of a discontinuity. A homogeneous and isotropic sample fails due to shear stresses in the sample. If a sample with a discontinuity is orientated such that the discontinuity is about parallel to the plane in which maximum shear stress will be developed during the test, the sample will fail due to shear displacement along the discontinuity, and hence, the shear strength of a discontinuity can be calculated.|$|E
50|$|From the <b>triaxial</b> <b>test</b> data, it is {{possible}} to extract fundamental material parameters about the sample, including its angle of shearing resistance, apparent cohesion, and dilatancy angle. These parameters are then used in computer models to predict how the material will behave in a larger-scale engineering application. An example would be to predict the stability of the soil on a slope, whether the slope will collapse or whether the soil will support the shear stresses of the slope and remain in place. Triaxial tests are used along with other tests to make such engineering predictions.|$|E
40|$|Compared to the {{standard}} constant confining pressure (CCP) tests, the variable confining pressure (VCP) type repeated load <b>triaxial</b> <b>tests</b> better simulate in the laboratory the effects of moving wheel loads since in the pavement structure the confining stress acting is cyclic in nature.

50|$|Triaxial testing {{systems have}} been {{developed}} to allow independent control of the stress in three perpendicular directions. This allows investigation of stress paths not capable of being generated in axisymmetric <b>triaxial</b> <b>test</b> machines, which can be useful in studies of cemented sands and anisotropic soils. The test cell is cubical, and there are six separate plates applying pressure to the specimen, with LVDTs reading movement of each plate. Pressure in the third direction can be applied using hydrostatic pressure in the test chamber, requiring only 4 stress application assemblies. The apparatus is significantly more complex than for axisymmetric triaxial tests, and is therefore less commonly used.|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} of different compressive stresses {{in the test}} apparatus causes shear stress to develop in the sample; the loads can be increased and deflections monitored until failure of the sample. During the test, the surrounding fluid is pressurized, and the stress on the platens is increased until the material in the cylinder fails and forms sliding regions within itself, known as shear bands. The geometry of the shearing in a <b>triaxial</b> <b>test</b> typically causes the sample to become shorter while bulging out along the sides. The stress on the platen is then reduced and the water pressure pushes the sides back in, causing the sample to grow taller again. This cycle is usually repeated several times while collecting stress and strain data about the sample. During the test the pore pressures of fluids (e.g., water, oil) or gasses in the sample may be measured using Bishop's pore pressure apparatus.|$|E

40|$|Isotropic {{consolidation}} test and consolidated-undrained <b>triaxial</b> <b>test</b> were first undertaken {{to obtain the}} parameters of the modified cam-clay (MCC) model and the behavior of natural clayey soil. Then, for the first time, numerical simulation of the two tests was performed by three-dimensional finite element method (FEM) using ABAQUS program. The consolidated-drained <b>triaxial</b> <b>test</b> was also simulated by FEM and compared with theoretical results of MCC model. Especially, the behaviors of MCC model during unloading and reloading were analyzed in detail by FEM. The analysis and comparison indicate that the MCC model is able to accurately describe many features of the mechanical behavior of the soil in isotropic {{consolidation test}} and consolidated-drained <b>triaxial</b> <b>test.</b> And the MCC model can well describe the variation of excess pore water pressure with the development of axial strain in consolidated-undrained <b>triaxial</b> <b>test,</b> but its ability to predict the relationship between axial strain and shear stress is relatively poor. The comparison also shows that FEM solutions of the MCC model are basically identical to the theoretical ones. In addition, Mandel-Cryer effect unable to be discovered by the conventional <b>triaxial</b> <b>test</b> in laboratories was disclosed by FEM. The analysis of unloading-reloading by FEM demonstrates that the MCC model disobeys the law of energy conservation under the cyclic loading condition if the elastic shear modulus is linearly pressure-dependent...|$|E
40|$|The {{liquefaction}} {{of saturated}} sand {{is due to}} a negative dilatancy. In the cyclic <b>triaxial</b> <b>test,</b> a part of pore water squeezed from sample is transformed into the reduction of membrane penetration and so the perfect undrained test can not be performed. Consequently, the liquefaction resistance obtained by the cyclic <b>triaxial</b> <b>test</b> is evaluated apparently larger than true value. In this paper, the method of correction of the liquefaction resistance is proposed by consideration of various experimental results. It is clear that the volume change of sample obtained by the undrained cyclic <b>triaxial</b> <b>test</b> is nearly equal to the expansive volume change of sample due to the decrease of effective stress. According to this relation, we considered that the liquefaction resistance obtained by the cyclic <b>triaxial</b> <b>test</b> can be corrected by means of the obtaining volumetric strain of sand structure concerned with the increase of pore pressure as the difference between expansive volume change and volume change been equivalent to the membrane penetration. This procedure is explained in Fig. 9 schematically...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhen {{granular}} {{materials are}} applied in geotechnical works, like embankments and road pavement layers, {{one of the}} most relevant engineering properties in stability analysis is ultimate shear strength. In geotechnical engineering, the <b>triaxial</b> <b>test</b> is {{one of the most}} reliable methods available for determining ultimate shear strength. In this test, a soil specimen, compacted in laboratory or collected from exploratory soil borings, is generally used. In order to determine the strength parameters, at least 3 identical specimens are required in this test. Having 3 identical specimens, a single stage <b>triaxial</b> <b>test</b> procedure is used. If not, multistage <b>triaxial</b> <b>test</b> procedure is used to eliminate the effects of soil variability in the results. In this case, several confining pressures are applied to the same specimen. Although multistage triaxial tests have been used for soils for a long time, there is still a lack of test results for unbound granular non-traditional materials. This paper presents <b>triaxial</b> <b>test</b> results obtained from a Portuguese unbound granular non-traditional material (named as Inert Steel Aggregate for Construction - ISAC). The triaxial tests were carried out using multistage and single stage techniques. As the results are quite well comparable, it is concluded that it is possible to determine shear strength parameters with just one specimen. Consequently, the research conducted has validated the use of multistage triaxial tests as a reliable and cost-effective alternative to the conventional single stage <b>triaxial</b> <b>test</b> in the mechanical characterization of unbound granular materials...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a constitutive model for a poorly graded sand, which was used in geotechnical experiments on buried pipes (reported elsewhere). The sand was tested extensively in the laboratory to determine the state parameter constants. <b>Triaxial</b> <b>tests</b> on the sand included conventional drained <b>triaxial</b> compression <b>tests,</b> as well as more specialized shearing tests at constant mean effective stress and others at constant volume. Single element simulation of the <b>triaxial</b> <b>tests</b> was performed to validate the proposed constitutive model. The adopted model allowed non-linear elastic behaviour prior to yielding. After yielding of the sand, the state parameter-based model for the sand permitted non-associated plastic flow. Dilation and frictional strength were both dependent on the current value of the state parameter. The combination of laboratory testing and single element modelling resulted in the selection of a single set of material constants for the soil, which adequately described the full range of <b>triaxial</b> <b>tests.</b> Subsequently the model was applied to the problem of a plate loading test on the sand and the model predictions were compared with the test data...|$|R
