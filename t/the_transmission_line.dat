5|$|There {{are many}} {{component}} forms {{used to construct}} distributed element filters, but all have the common property of causing a discontinuity on <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line.</b> These discontinuities present a reactive impedance to a wavefront travelling down the line, and these reactances can be chosen by design to serve as approximations for lumped inductors, capacitors or resonators, {{as required by the}} filter.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{structure that}} can be implemented {{is a step in}} the characteristic impedance of the line, which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics. This is done in planar technologies by a change in the width of <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line.</b> Figure 4(a) shows a step up in impedance (narrower lines have higher impedance). A step down in impedance would be the mirror image of figure 4(a). The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a series inductor, or more exactly, as a low-pass T circuit as shown in figure 4(a). Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with impedance transformers to produce a filter of higher order. These impedance transformers can be just a short (often λ/4) length of transmission line. These composite structures can implement any of the filter families (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) by approximating the rational transfer function of the corresponding lumped element filter. This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of lumped element and distributed element behaviour. Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters (the so-called semi-lumped structures).|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{successful}} {{design of}} high speed {{printed circuit boards}} requires {{the knowledge of the}} dynamical behaviour of <b>the</b> interconnecting <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> structures which is [...] - assuming quasi-TEM wave propagation [...] - described by <b>the</b> well known <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> theory. This means, if losses can be neglected, <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> can be characterised by their characteristic impedance ZL and their characteristic propagation delay TD or phase velocity v ph (TD = v Γ 1 ph), respectively. To minimise reflection effects caused by impedance discontinuities between different <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> areas located on different layers, PCB designers increasingly require characteristic impedances which correspond to prescribed values with a specified accuracy. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line's</b> propagation delay is of increasing importance, taki...|$|R

25|$|Natural {{gas flowing}} in the {{distribution}} lines and at the natural gas well head are often used to power natural gas powered engines. These engines rotate compressors to facilitate the natural gas transmission. These compressors are required in the mid-stream line to pressurize and to re-pressurize the natural gas in <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> as the gas travels. The natural gas transmission lines extend to the natural gas processing plant or unit which removes the higher molecular weighted natural gas hydrocarbons to produce a British thermal unit (BTU) value between 950 and 1050BTUs. The processed natural gas may then be used for residential, commercial and industrial uses.|$|E
25|$|The {{result is}} a {{frequency}} compensated probe for modest frequencies that presents a load of about 10megohms shunted by 12pF. Although such a probe is an improvement, {{it does not work}} when the time scale shrinks to several cable transit times (transit time is typically 5ns). In that time frame, the cable looks like its characteristic impedance, and there will be reflections from <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> mismatch at the scope input and the probe that causes ringing. The modern scope probe uses lossy low capacitance transmission lines and sophisticated frequency shaping networks to make the 10X probe perform well at several hundred megahertz. Consequently, there are other adjustments for completing the compensation.|$|E
25|$|Many {{electrical}} properties of networks of components (inductors, capacitors, resistors) may be expressed using S-parameters, such as gain, return loss, voltage {{standing wave ratio}} (VSWR), reflection coefficient and amplifier stability. The term 'scattering' is more common to optical engineering than RF engineering, referring to the effect observed when a plane electromagnetic wave is incident on an obstruction or passes across dissimilar dielectric media. In the context of S-parameters, scattering refers {{to the way in}} which the traveling currents and voltages in a transmission line are affected when they meet a discontinuity caused by the insertion of a network into <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line.</b> This is equivalent to the wave meeting an impedance differing from the line's characteristic impedance.|$|E

25|$|The quantum key {{distribution}} protocols described above provide Alice and Bob with nearly identical shared keys, and also with {{an estimate of the}} discrepancy between the keys. These differences can be caused by eavesdropping, but also by imperfections in <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> and detectors. As it is impossible to distinguish between these two types of errors, guaranteed security requires the assumption that all errors are due to eavesdropping. Provided the error rate between the keys is lower than a certain threshold (20% as of April 2007), two steps can be performed to first remove the erroneous bits and then reduce Eve's knowledge of the key to an arbitrary small value. These two steps are known as information reconciliation and privacy amplification respectively, and were first described in 1992.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{model of}} <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> was probably described by Georg Ohm (1827) who established that resistance in a wire {{is proportional to}} its length.*John C. Shedd, Mayo D. Hershey, [...] "The history of Ohm's law", The Popular Science Monthly, pp.599-614, December 1913 ISSN 0161-7370. The Ohm model thus included only resistance. Latimer Clark noted that signals were delayed and elongated along a cable, an undesirable form of distortion now called dispersion but then called retardation, and Michael Faraday (1853) established that {{this was due to}} the capacitance present in <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line.</b> Lord Kelvin (1854) found the correct mathematical description needed in his work on early transatlantic cables; he arrived at an equation identical to the conduction of a heat pulse along a metal bar. This model incorporates only resistance and capacitance, but that is all that was needed in undersea cables dominated by capacitance effects. Kelvin's model predicts a limit on the telegraph signalling speed of a cable but Kelvin still did not use the concept of bandwidth, the limit was entirely explained in terms of the dispersion of the telegraph symbols. The mathematical model of <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> reached its fullest development with Oliver Heaviside. Heaviside (1881) introduced series inductance and shunt conductance into the model making four distributed elements in all. This model is now known as the telegrapher's equation and the distributed elements are called the primary line constants.Heaviside, O, Electrical Papers, vol 1, pp.139-140, Boston, 1925 ...|$|E
500|$|Constant {{resistance}} sections {{may also}} be required, if the filter is being used on a transmission line, to improve the flatness of the passband response. [...] This is necessary because <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> response is not usually anywhere near perfectly flat. [...] These sections would normally be placed closest to the line since they present a predictable impedance to the line and also tend to mask the indeterminate impedance of the line {{from the rest of}} the filter. [...] There is no issue with matching constant resistance sections to each other even when the sections are operating on totally different frequency bands. [...] All sections can be made to have precisely the same image impedance of a fixed resistance.|$|E
500|$|At {{microwave}} frequencies, none of {{the transfer}} matrices based on port voltages and currents are convenient to use in practice. [...] Voltage is difficult to measure directly, current next to impossible, and the open circuits and short circuits required by the measurement technique cannot be achieved with any accuracy. [...] For waveguide implementations, circuit voltage and current are entirely meaningless. [...] Transfer matrices using different sorts of variables are used instead. [...] These are the powers tranmitted into, and reflected from a port which are readily measured in <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> technology used in distributed-element circuits in the microwave band.

500|$|The {{capacitive}} gap structure {{consists of}} sections of line about λ/2 in length which act as resonators and are coupled [...] "end-on" [...] by gaps in <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line.</b> It is particularly suitable for planar formats, is easily implemented with printed circuit technology {{and has the}} advantage of taking up no more space than a plain transmission line would. The limitation of this topology is that performance (particularly insertion loss) deteriorates with increasing fractional bandwidth, and acceptable results are not obtained with a Q less than about 5. A further difficulty with producing low-Q designs is that the gap width is required to be smaller for wider fractional bandwidths. The minimum width of gaps, like the minimum width of tracks, is limited by the resolution of the printing technology.|$|E
