5|$|According to {{the census}} data, almost 80 percent of Chinese Indonesians are Buddhist or Christian (Catholic and Protestant). Chinese Indonesians {{tend to be}} more Christian than other Chinese ethnic groups of Southeast Asia due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> of {{historical}} reasons. Throughout the 20th century Chinese religion and culture was forbidden and persecuted in Indonesia, forcing many Chinese to convert to Christianity. The first wave of conversions occurred in the 1950s and 1960s, and the number of ethnic Chinese Christians during this period quadrupled. The second wave followed after the government withdrew Confucianism's status as a recognized religion in the 1970s. Suharto endorsed a systematic campaign of eradication of Confucianism. Jakarta is home to largest Chinese Christians, meanwhile Medan is home to the largest Buddhist Chinese in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|In the mathematically {{rigorous}} {{formulation of}} quantum mechanics, developed by John von Neumann, the possible states (more precisely, the pure states) of a quantum mechanical system {{are represented by}} unit vectors (called state vectors) residing in a complex separable Hilbert space, known as the state space, well defined up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> number of norm 1 (the phase factor). In other words, the possible states are points in the projectivization of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex projective space. The exact nature of this Hilbert space {{is dependent on the}} system; for example, the position and momentum states for a single non-relativistic spin zero particle is the space of all square-integrable functions, while the states for the spin of a single proton are unit elements of the two-dimensional complex Hilbert space of spinors. Each observable is represented by a self-adjoint linear operator acting on the state space. Each eigenstate of an observable corresponds to an eigenvector of the operator, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate.|$|E

Natasha casually dates Ivan DeMarco (Ben Knight) and in a bid to appear more mature, she sends him naked photos of herself. They are leaked, causing a scandal amongst Natasha's school friends.

5|$|The Bay Area is home <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> {{network of}} watersheds, marshes, rivers, creeks, reservoirs, and bays that {{predominantly}} drain into the San Francisco Bay and Pacific Ocean. The largest {{bodies of water}} in the Bay Area are the San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun estuaries. Major rivers of the North Bay include the Napa River, the Petaluma River, the Gualala River, and the Russian River; the former two drain into San Pablo Bay, the latter two into the Pacific Ocean. In the South Bay, the Guadalupe River drains into San Francisco Bay near Alviso. There are also several lakes present in the Bay Area, including man-made lakes like Lake Berryessa and natural albeit heavily modified lakes like Lake Merritt.|$|E
5|$|The brain {{develops}} in an intricately orchestrated sequence of stages. It changes in shape {{from a simple}} swelling {{at the front of}} the nerve cord in the earliest embryonic stages, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> array of areas and connections. Neurons are created in special zones that contain stem cells, and then migrate through the tissue to reach their ultimate locations. Once neurons have positioned themselves, their axons sprout and navigate through the brain, branching and extending as they go, until the tips reach their targets and form synaptic connections. In a number of parts of the nervous system, neurons and synapses are produced in excessive numbers during the early stages, and then the unneeded ones are pruned away.|$|E

5|$|These {{complexes}} {{were usually}} {{located in the}} site core, beside a principal plaza. Maya palaces consisted of a platform supporting a multiroom range structure. The term acropolis, in a Maya context, refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> of structures built upon platforms of varying height. Palaces and acropoleis were essentially elite residential compounds. They generally extended horizontally {{as opposed to the}} towering Maya pyramids, and often had restricted access. Some structures in Maya acropoleis supported roof combs. Rooms often had stone benches, used for sleeping, and holes indicate where curtains once hung. Large palaces, such as at Palenque, could be fitted with a water supply, and sweat baths were often found within the complex, or nearby. During the Early Classic, rulers were sometimes buried underneath the acropolis complex. Some rooms in palaces were true throne rooms; in the royal palace of Palenque {{there were a number of}} throne rooms that were used for important events, including the inauguration of new kings.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{proteins}} that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA {{is held in}} complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called chromatin. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> of small basic proteins called histones, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved. The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a nucleosome, which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones, making ionic bonds to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are thus largely independent of the base sequence. Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation. These chemical changes alter {{the strength of the}} interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors and changing the rate of transcription. Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA. These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make up chromosomes.|$|E
