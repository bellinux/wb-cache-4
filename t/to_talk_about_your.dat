6000|$|... "As you didn't {{expect an}} audience, perhaps I'd better promise not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> play. You {{may have felt}} some diffidence about asking that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Duties {{are always}} {{numerous}} and pleasures strangely few. Besides, at Las Palmas, you command. But {{if one is}} allowed <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> other guest----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wants <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> book," [...] he explains. [...] "Disagrees {{with you}} {{entirely on the}} subject of platonic friendship. Sure you'll be able to {{convince}} him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jumping dandelions {{and happy}} hollyhocks, but that smells good <b>to</b> me! <b>Talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> attar o' roses an' cologne factories! They ain't in it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no doubt," [...] Julien admitted, [...] "that the {{situation}} {{would be a}} trifle difficult, but <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> earning <b>your</b> own living--you, Lady Anne--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] he answered, almost savagely. [...] "Come in {{and shut}} the door. I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you--not <b>about</b> <b>your</b> books. Yes, let us sit down--where you will. That couch is big enough for both of us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sary Ann," [...] said Mrs. Gray, as sharply as any {{one ever}} heard her speak, [...] "that's a pretty way <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> sister, ain't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then what, Madam, induces you to {{tell these}} absurd stories to me, and <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> riches, when {{you know that you}} and your daughters are beggars, Ma'am--BEGGARS?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God {{bless the}} man!" [...] cried the Canon, jumping up indignantly, [...] "you don't {{mean to say}} you've come to me at eleven o'clock on a Sunday night <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> lease?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must speak}} quickly, for I am dying--I know it, feel it. I was sick on board; that's why I know. The doctor said I couldn't live, and the storm has only hastened matters. I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you <b>about</b> <b>your</b> husband." ...|$|R
6000|$|The old soldier laughed {{until his}} merriment startled the clerks in the counting-house. [...] "Be jabers!" [...] he said, In a wheezy voice, [...] "d'ye think I came five miles to do that? No, sir, I wanted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you <b>about</b> <b>your</b> son." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come in on Friday afternoon, Gaylord," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Crewe. [...] "I've got {{several things}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you <b>about.</b> <b>Your</b> general acquaintance around the State will be useful, and {{there must be}} men you know of in the lumber sections who can help us considerably." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You're a liar,' said Jonas. 'You haven't a {{right to}} any consideration. You haven't {{a right to}} anything. You're a pretty sort of fellow <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> rights, upon my soul! Ha, ha!--Rights, too!' ...|$|E
6000|$|The manager met {{him with}} [...] "Ah, I'm {{glad you came}} soon. These things fade out of one's mind so, and I really want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> play. I've been very much {{interested}} in it." ...|$|E
60|$|STRAKER. [unperturbed] Yes. Well, this {{conversation}} is very improvin; but I've {{got to look}} after the car; and you two want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> ladies. I know. [He retires to busy himself about the car; and presently saunters off towards the house].|$|E
6000|$|... "Cynthia," [...] said Miss Lucretia, [...] "I have {{a meeting}} now of a girls' charity to which I must go, but you will come {{to me at the}} offices of the Woman's Hour to-morrow morning at ten. I wish <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you <b>about</b> <b>your</b> mother and yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Jack, {{you are a}} lucky fellow!" [...] Harry said, when he had finished. [...] "To {{think of}} your having gone through all those adventures and living to tell of them. Why, it will be {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> all <b>your</b> life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are to {{come here}} {{as often as you}} like," [...] he told her. [...] "When a young lady and I make a compact of {{friendship}} I am going to live up to it. But you are not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me <b>about</b> <b>your</b> mother. Remember, we are friends because I am I and you are you, and there is no question of anybody else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} I expect. I {{expected}} {{you to say}} something without my prompting you. You {{know that it was}} outrageous for me <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> apparition without your leave, and to be the means of its getting into the newspapers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I really cannot {{tell you}} {{anything}} about his friends. And, {{to tell you the}} truth, Brooke, I don't want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> uncle. Of course, you can go to see him when you please, but I'd rather you didn't tell me of your visits afterwards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know, but---- It {{is nice to}} go out to {{his place}} on the Point. Oh, Gene, I do wish you'd try and {{remember}} not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> business so much. You and Mr. Martin were talking about the price of lumber for at least half an hour----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{will read}} the sermon, {{so there is}} no need <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>Your</b> brother was {{overcome}} for a minute at the reference to his father, but the comfort and favour of His Heavenly Master kept him singularly calm, though the week before he had undoubtedly had much struggle, and his bodily health was affected.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sundays are my best times. You {{must come}} on Sundays. There are such heaps of things I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> and ask <b>your</b> advice <b>about.</b> Now I must {{get back to}} work.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{say if you}} are {{not very}} much obliged to me. Much good it was for me <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you <b>about</b> <b>your</b> nose! You would never have found out how {{extraordinary}} it was if it hadn't hindered you from doing what you wanted to. You see how self-love keeps us from knowing our own defects of mind and body. Our reason tries in vain to show them to us; we refuse to see them till we find them in the way of our interests." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} that is so," [...] the doctor agreed. [...] "My job's not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> friends, {{but to give}} you good advice. Cut out unhealthy excitement and go steady. If you like it, go up on the rocks. Mountaineering's dangerous, but sometimes one runs worse risks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{sounds too}} flat for you <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> {{remaining}} unheard of. Of {{course you are}} ambitious; any one can see that, to look at you. And once your ambition is excited in any particular direction, people had better look out. With your will!" [...] she added, with a curious mocking candour.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps you didn't. It {{was your}} Scottish reserve {{that made you}} hate <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> family affairs; but Jim, who counts you as his partner, has told me something. Then I don't mind telling you that I like you and admire what {{you are trying to}} do. However, we'll keep to the point. Williamson is leading your cousin into extravagance with some object." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{your father}} die to-morrow, my dear, {{he will not}} leave us a shilling. And who can complain? I cannot. He has always been very frank. I {{remember}} when {{we were going to}} marry, and I was obliged <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him <b>about</b> <b>your</b> portion; I remember {{it as if it were}} only yesterday; I remember his saying, with the most flattering smile in the world, [...] "I wish the 5,000L., Sir Ratcliffe, were 50,000L., for your sake; particularly as it will never be in my power to increase it."' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Brien Boru! You {{might as}} well <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him <b>about</b> <b>your</b> washing-bills! Don't go into particulars--stick to generals. He'll never ask you those {{questions}} unless he sees you shiver and shake like a half-whipped school-boy." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lisa Whittington, a {{black woman}} who has also painted {{pictures}} on Emmett Till told NBC News [...] "Art takes courage. It takes courage to create it, to show it, and to listen <b>to</b> people <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> work. While I appreciate Dana Shutz's courage, and attempt to understand â€” for me, her understanding is not deep enough and careless. The horror was too gentle in her work. She fell short and did not tell a complete story. She downplayed the details and the emotion his death represented." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{no claim}} upon you, Arnold," [...] she {{reminded}} him, [...] "and I think that soon you will pass {{out of my}} life. It is only natural. You must go on, I must remain. And that {{is the end of}} it," [...] she added, with a little quiver of the lips. [...] "Now let us finish talking about ourselves. I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> new friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think so}} very differently, Emily, that under no {{circumstances}} will I have you taken to another home. I cannot understand much of all this yet, but I suppose I shall come to see it. If Lopez be, as you say, ruined, it is well that I have still {{enough for us to}} live on. This is a bad time just now <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> husband's affairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I enclose {{a ticket}} for the manager's box. I hope you can come. I [...] want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> play. I will send my brother to bring you [...] in back to see me. I have been rehearsing all the afternoon, but I [...] re-read the play this morning while in bed. I like it better and [...] better, {{but you can do}} more with it--I feel that you have [...] {{suppressed}} the poetry here and there. My quarrel with you realists [...] is that you are afraid to put into your representations of life the [...] emotions that make life a dynamic thing. But it is stirring and [...] suggestive as it is. Come in and talk with me, for I am full of it [...] and see great possibilities in the final act." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But now I {{must stop}} chatting about myself, for I {{know that you}} cannot be {{interested}} in a simple old fogey such as I am. Let me <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you <b>about</b> <b>your</b> letter and <b>about</b> the difficult question it raises for all marriageable young men.|$|R

6000|$|I {{went back}} to the tents, and {{consulted}} Hilda and Lady Meadowcroft. Our spoilt child pouted, and was utterly averse to any detour of any sort. [...] "Let's get back straight to Ivor," [...] she said, petulantly. [...] "I've had enough of camping out. It's all very well in its way for a week but when they begin <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> cutting <b>your</b> throat and all that, it ceases to be a joke and becomes a wee bit uncomfortable. I want my feather bed. I object to their villages." ...|$|R
