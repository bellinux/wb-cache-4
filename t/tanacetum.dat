5|$|Bacterial {{insecticides}} can {{be effective}} if application is targeted towards the vulnerable early-instar larvae. Two strains of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produce toxins which kill the larvae. Other forms of pest control, through non-pesticidal management are available. Feeding can be inhibited by applying antifeedants, such as fungicides or products derived from Neem (Azadirachta indica), but these may have negative effects on the plants as well. The steam distillate of fresh leaves and flowers of tansy (<b>Tanacetum</b> vulgare) contains high levels of camphor and umbellulone and these chemicals are strongly repellent to L. decemlineata.|$|E
5|$|The tansy beetle has a Palearctic distribution. Evidence from archaeological {{excavation}} {{has shown}} that its presence in western Europe is confirmed at least {{as early as the}} Neolithic period. The beetles may be found on tansy (<b>Tanacetum</b> vulgare) and water mint (Mentha aquatica) in fen land and the banks of rivers with broad floodplains in Britain. Larvae are also recorded from other host plants: Achillea ptarmica (sneezewort) in France and various plants of the genus Artemisia in Russia. Adults and larvae feed on the leaves of their host plants.|$|E

Juniper trees grow wild in some locations and are usually considered sacred by Buddhists.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tanacetum</b> is a genus {{of about}} 160 species of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} aster family, Asteraceae, native to many regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are known commonly as tansies. The name tansy can refer specifically to <b>Tanacetum</b> vulgare, which may be called the common tansy or garden tansy for clarity.|$|E
5000|$|Many tansy species {{contain a}} {{volatile}} oil {{which can cause}} contact dermatitis in sensitive individuals. If taken internally, toxic metabolites are produced as the oil is broken down in the liver and digestive tract. It is highly toxic to internal parasites, and for centuries tansy tea has been prescribed by herbalists to expel worms. Tansy is an effective insecticide and is highly toxic to arthropods. Because it contains thujone, the U.S. FDA limits the use of tansy to alcoholic beverages, and the final product must be thujone-free. [...] <b>Tanacetum</b> annuum is often confused with common tansy (<b>Tanacetum</b> vulgare) but the former produces an essential oil that is completely different chemically as it contains no thujone and high amounts of chamazulene making the oil dark blue in color, giving rise to it common name of Blue Tansy Oil. [...] Despite claims by some unethical resellers of essential oils who adulterate the very expensive Blue Tansy (<b>Tanacetum</b> annuum) oil with the much cheaper oil from <b>Tanacetum</b> vulgare, {{it should be noted}} that the oil from <b>Tanacetum</b> vulgare is never blue in color as it contains no chamazulene. For this reason a high thujone oil from <b>Tanacetum</b> vulgare should never be referred to as [...] "Blue Tansy" [...] oil and any such blue oil containing significant thujone is an adulterated product.|$|E
