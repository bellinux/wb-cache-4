5|$|Bede wrote Ecgbert {{a letter}} dealing with monastic {{issues as well}} as the {{problems}} of large dioceses. The letter, written in 734, became known as the Epistola ad Ecgberhtum episcopum. Bede urged Ecgbert to study Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, and held up Aidan and Cuthbert as examples of model bishops. The main thrust of Bede's letter was <b>to</b> <b>urge</b> Ecgbert to reform his church to more closely resemble Gregory the Great's original plan for it. Bede's admonition to divide up dioceses fell on deaf ears, as Egbert did not break up his large diocese. The suffragans continued to be limited to the bishops of Hexham, Lindisfarne, and Whithorn.|$|E

Harding biographer Charles W. Murray noted that there is no evidence besides Harvey's word that Harding went to the Hays suite that night, and that other participants denied that Harding was there. Harding was so uncertain of victory that he filed for re-election to the Senate, though Daugherty continued <b>to</b> <b>urge</b> delegates to support him.|$|E

At a council held at Westminster in October 1163, the king and Becket contended over the question, with the bishops supporting Becket against the king. Robert was involved in the conflict not only as a bishop-elect, but as an envoy to Becket from the pope, as he accompanied Philip of Aumone, a French abbot, who was sent by Alexander to Becket in after the Council of Westminster <b>to</b> <b>urge</b> Becket not to inflame the situation. Robert went with Philip, probably because it was hoped {{he would be able to}} influence Becket.|$|E
5|$|In December 1997, Suharto for {{the first}} time did not attend an ASEAN presidents' summit, which was later {{revealed}} to be due to a minor stroke, creating speculation about his health and the immediate future of his presidency. In mid-December, as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country, he appeared at a press conference to re-assert his authority and <b>to</b> <b>urge</b> people to trust the government and the collapsing Rupiah. However, his attempts to re-instill confidence had little effect. Evidence suggested that his family and associates were being spared the toughest requirements of the IMF reform process, further undermining confidence in the economy and his leadership.|$|E

As leader of the National Guard, Lafayette had been {{responsible}} for the royal family's custody. He was thus blamed by extremists like Danton for the near-escape and called a traitor to the people by Robespierre. These accusations made Lafayette appear a royalist, damaging his reputation {{in the eyes of the}} public, and strengthened the hands of the Jacobins and other radicals. Lafayette continued <b>to</b> <b>urge</b> the constitutional rule of law, but was drowned out by the mob and its leaders.|$|E

Because of his actions the pass was taken, and its capture was an important preliminary to the end of organized hostile resistance. Martinez was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{main cause}} of relapse in smokers {{attempting}} to quit is inability <b>to</b> resist <b>urges</b> <b>to</b> smoke. Pharmacotherapy ameliorates but does not entirely prevent <b>urges</b> <b>to</b> smoke when abstinent, so other methods <b>to</b> resist <b>urges</b> <b>to</b> smoke might be helpful. Exercise is effective, but aerobic exercise is often impractical when urges strike. Two techniques, body scan and isometric exercise, have been shown <b>to</b> reduce <b>urge</b> intensity and nicotine withdrawal symptoms in temporarily abstinent smokers. It is unclear whether they would be used or effective in typical smokers attempting to quit. METHODS: In a pilot trial set in a UK smoking cessation clinic, 20 smokers were randomised to receive emails containing. mp 3 files and. pdf illustrations of the instructions for doing the body scan and isometric exercises. Twenty smokers received no other intervention, although all 40 were receiving weekly behavioural support and nicotine replacement therapy. Carbon monoxide confirmed abstinence, nicotine withdrawal symptoms, <b>urges</b> <b>to</b> smoke, {{and use of the}} techniques <b>to</b> resist <b>urges</b> were recorded weekly for four weeks after quit day. RESULTS: 60 - 80 % of quitters reported using the isometric exercises each week and 40 - 70 % reported using the body scan <b>to</b> deal with <b>urges.</b> On average, these techniques were rated as 'slightly helpful' for controlling the urges. There were no large or significant differences in withdrawal symptoms or urge intensity between the two groups. The risk ratio and 95 % confidence interval for exercises compared with controls for prolonged confirmed abstinence at four weeks was 0. 82 (0. 44 - 1. 53). 81 % of quitters intended to continue using isometric exercises and 25 % body scan, while 81 % and 50 % respectively would recommend using these techniques to others trying to stop. CONCLUSION: Isometric exercises, {{and to a lesser extent}} body scan, were popular and perceived as somewhat helpful by quitters. The trial showed that these techniques were used and a larger trial could now be developed to examine the influence of the methods on reducing <b>urges</b> <b>to</b> smoke and increasing abstinence...|$|R

Still, newspaper connection meant that he soon heard of one of the war's other effects: the many Jewish merchants and middlemen war brought to Bucharest were a boon to Abraham Goldfaden's nascent Yiddish theater there. Two of his Odessa acquaintances—Israel Rosenberg, a personable con-man, and Jacob Spivakofsky, scion of a wealthy Jewish family—had become actors there, then had left Goldfaden to found their own company, touring in Moldavia.

5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{unsuccessful}} attempt {{to save the}} Star Ferry pier in early 2007, a campaign to preserve the pier in situ was launched.

On 22 April, about 100 protesters once again rallied at the pier, launching farewell voyages in a last-ditch attempt <b>to</b> <b>urge</b> the Government to reconsider: a petition of over 400 signatures from the Arts community was collected.|$|E

In one instance, an Ewondo interpreter fired a gun during a dispute with a German, an offence punishable with a stiff prison sentence. Atangana interceded, and the man's punishment was reduced to porter duty. However, the paramount chief remained completely loyal to the governors. In 1914, for example, representatives of Duala leader Rudolf Duala Manga Bell tried to secure Atangana's backing for a pan-Kamerun revolt. Atangana kept the plot under wraps, but he instructed the envoy <b>to</b> <b>urge</b> Manga Bell to reconsider.|$|E
