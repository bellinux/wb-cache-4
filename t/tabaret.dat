25|$|In his March 2009 inaugural speech, Quebec Premier Jean Charest {{announced}} that his government intends to further develop the province's hydroelectric potential. The call for {{further development of}} hydroelectric and other renewable generating capacity has been implemented in the company's 2009-2013 strategic plan, released on July 30, 2009. Hydro-Québec plans capacity upgrades at the Jean-Lesage (120 MW) and René-Lévesque (210 MW) stations and a third unit at the SM-3 plant (440 MW). The company will also conduct technical and environmental studies and undertake consultations with local communities to build new facilities on the Petit-Mécatina (1,200 MW) and Magpie (850 MW) rivers on the North Shore, and revive the <b>Tabaret</b> project (132 MW) in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, in western Quebec.|$|E
5000|$|Gaboriau {{influenced}} later detective fiction writers, notably Conan Doyle, who acknowledged {{his debt}} to Gaboriau. Conan Doyle wrote, ‘Gaboriau had rather attracted {{me by the}} neat dovetailing of his plots, and Poe’s masterful detective, M. Dupin, had from boyhood {{been one of my}} heroes. But could I bring an addition of my own?’ [...] Conan Doyle also uses Gaboriau’s two-part structure for two of the four longer Sherlock Holmes stories. [...] Holmes’s skill in the art of disguise is equal to that of Lecoq. [...] Liebow observes that there is a startling similarity between Holmes and Lecoq’s speech, conduct, and meditations. However, Holmes denigrates Lecoq in A Study in Scarlet, dismissing him as a ‘miserable bungler.’ [...] Gaboriau was also an influence on John Russell Coryell, who read his works. His detective, Nick Carter, follows in Lecoq and <b>Tabaret’s</b> footsteps.|$|R

[...] It currently houses the university's Department of Visual Arts and the University Gallery. [...] Also notable is <b>Tabaret</b> Hall (erected 1905), a neoclassical building designed by A.

50|$|Lecoq goes to amateur detective, Père <b>Tabaret</b> for advice. <b>Tabaret</b> {{states that}} M. d’Escorval’s fall and Mai’s {{attempted}} suicide {{were not a}} coincidence, and that the two are enemies. By his reasoning it appears impossible for Mai to be the Duke of Sairmeuse, therefore Mai and the Duke of Sairmeuse {{are one and the}} same. Through consultation of biographies of the Duke of Sairmeuse and M. d’Escoval’s fathers, he reveals the hatred that exists between the royalist Sairmeuses and the Republican Escorvals. He says that the prisoner tried to kill himself because he thought his identity would be exposed and that this would bring shame on his family name.|$|E
50|$|Gaboriau first {{achieved}} publishing {{success with}} L’Affaire Lerouge, serialised in 1865, which featured the amateur detective, <b>Tabaret,</b> who recurs {{in his later}} novels.

5000|$|Joseph-Henri <b>Tabaret</b> (12 April 1828 [...] - [...] 8 February 1886) was a Canadian Roman Catholic Priest and academic, {{best known}} {{because of his}} long and {{important}} association with the University of Ottawa.

5000|$|The Gee Gees {{played in}} several rinks {{before the current}} Minto Sports Complex, which {{was built on the}} site of the Minto Arena, the former Minto Skating Club facility, which was {{demolished}} in 2000. Ottawa has held games at the Sandy Hill Arena and the Robert Guertin Arena in Hull. The first rink, was known as [...] "College Yard", which was an outdoor rink in front of <b>Tabaret</b> Hall. The second venue for the Gee Gees was the indoor Rideau Skating Rink, which was flooded during winter for the ice surface. The site on the corner of Waller Street and Laurier Avenue is now the Arts building at the University of Ottawa.|$|E

In 1999, the club merged with Southbank Amateur Football Club in 1999 and joined the Victorian Amateur Football Association under the stewardship of Herald Sun racing writer Tim Habel. It also re-established its junior arm; and, after commencing with just two junior teams, the club now has eight junior teams and has formed a joint Under 19 team with Caulfield Football Club.

5000|$|Bonnoit {{highlights}} {{the influence of}} the Mémoires de Vidocq on Gaboriau, the partly fictionalised memoires of a thief who {{went on to become the}} head of the Paris police, particularly the influence of Vidocq’s art of disguise. [...] Lits observes that Lecoq’s name was clearly formed in imitation of Vidocq, and that this was the name of the policeman in Paul Féval’s Habits Noirs. [...] Gaboriau’s detectives, both Lecoq and <b>Tabaret,</b> solve crimes in a manner that is similar to that of Edgar Allan Poe’s detective, Dupin. [...] As Gaboriau admired Poe, it is not surprising that Lecoq and Dupin share many traits, and Murch observes, “they both regard a mysterious puzzle as a challenge to their powers of perception; they reason with mathematical precision and enjoy giving little lectures on ‘algebraic analysis’ to their associates.” ...|$|E

Women first enrolled in 1919.In the fall of 1939, a Canadian Officer Training Corp was established at the university, with training beginning on in January 1940. The Canadian Officers' Training Corps, University of Ottawa Contingent, which comprised a company, headquarters and three platoons in 1939, was authorized to become a battalion in 1940. By 1941, the unit swelled to 550 men. An air force Officers' Training Corp was created in 1942 and a naval Officers' training corp in 1943. Participation in one of the three corps became mandatory for all students over 18, although they were not obliged to participate in the actual war {{at the end of their}} studies. During this time, the Royal Canadian Air Force used parts of the university's grounds for training and the university constructed barracks to house members of the Canadian Women's Army Corps. In total 1,158 students and alumni of the university enrolled the Canadian Forces during the Second World War, of which 50 died overseas. The unit was eventually disbanded during the unification of the Armed Forces in 1968.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the salient}} {{features}} of detective fiction that is prominent in Monsieur Lecoq {{is the art}} of disguise. It is the mark of a good detective, and Lecoq is a master of disguise. [...] Gaboriau also establishes a contrast that was to characterise later detective fiction: the distinction between policemen and amateur detectives. Lecoq has a passion for detection, but he is preoccupied with professional success, while <b>Tabaret</b> carries out detective work without remuneration for the satisfaction and pleasure it provides him. [...] Gaboriau’s detectives differ from other detectives in their fallibility. Bonnoit stresses that while they are geniuses of detection, they are not supermen like Dupin or Sherlock Holmes. [...] Goulet highlights the prominence of logical reasoning in Gaboriau, which is a feature of the writing of most detective fiction authors. [...] Gunning considers that Lecoq is the first instance of a detective meticulously scouring a crime scene. [...] He also states that Gaboriau, with Lecoq, ‘introduces detailed visual scrutiny to the genre,’ eliciting an account of past events from inanimate objects. Lecoq does not merely look at objects, he reads them. [...] The novel also introduces elements of detection as science, which was later pursued by Sherlock Holmes. Lecoq compares the work of a detective to that of a naturalist, and resolves to observe Mai as minutely as a naturalist examines an insect under a microscope.|$|E
40|$|Hydro-Québec {{wants to}} divert the Kipawa River in {{northwest}} Québec from its natural streambed. While the first time visitor is likely to emphatically proclaim the Kipawa River as the most beautiful, most serene place they have ever encountered, hydro consultants and engineers, disconnected from the attractiveness of that place, are making cost/benefit recommendations that marginalize the inherent value of a free-flowing Kipawa. This paper will discuss the following points: (1) The Kipawa River has its own inherent value, which {{is related to the}} cost of simulating threatened white-water habitats in general. (2) The costs of recreating white-water habitats are more understandable through the study of man-made white-water venues. (3) The cost to recreate or simulate a threatened white-water habitat should be factored into the cost of the hydro-project feasibility. The Kipawa River's own inherent value should be factored into the cost of the <b>Tabaret</b> Diversion Project. (4) Methods of gaining community acceptance should be public and open: independent third-party arbitartion is recommended. Use of monetary incentives to encourage public acceptance is unethical, immoral and unjustly biased against the survival of white-water habitats. (5) Recreational use of white-water habitats, like the Kipawa River are increasingly important engines of economic growth in Canada and around the world.
