5|$|Clara {{explored}} eastern religions for a {{few years}} and then eventually became a Christian Scientist, although there is some question as to her seriousness and commitment to it.

5|$|F. emasculata and Pinck Pharmaceuticals are fictitious, but {{pharmaceutical}} companies do send scientists {{all over the}} world looking for plants and animals that could have medicinal use.

Initially, the producers were wary of releasing the episode so close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>release</b> <b>of</b> the similarly-themed movie Outbreak. In the end, however, they realized that the two entities were separate and stood on their own.|$|E

The action resulted in negative publicity for the company when Claire Field, the then 15-year-old webmaster of the British fansite harrypotterguide.co.uk, was reduced to tears by what were described by her father as unnecessary bully tactics. Eventually the corporation backed down {{in the face of}} media opposition and declared that, as the site was non-commercial, it did not violate the trademark.|$|E

5|$|Liver {{cells are}} {{another example of}} {{specialized}} cells that contain an abundance of smooth ER. These cells provide {{an example of the}} role of smooth ER in carbohydrate metabolism. Liver cells store carbohydrates in the form of glycogen. The breakdown of glycogen eventually leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>release</b> <b>of</b> glucose from the liver cells, which is important in the regulation of sugar concentration in the blood. However, the primary product of glycogen breakdown is glucose-1-phosphate. This is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and then an enzyme of the liver cell's smooth ER removes the phosphate from the glucose, so that it can then leave the cell.|$|E

Initially critical of her work, O'Brien had become a fan of Madonna after seeing her perform on television for The Virgin Tour in 1985. From that point of time, the author followed Madonna's career closely, visited her concert tours, and collected interviews, magazines, and albums.|$|E
5|$|Neutrophils {{also play}} a key role in the {{development}} of most forms of acute lung injury. Here, activated neutrophils release the contents of their toxic granules into the lung environment. Experiments have shown that a reduction in the number of neutrophils lessens the effects of acute lung injury, but treatment by inhibiting neutrophils is not clinically realistic, as it would leave the host vulnerable to infection. In the liver, damage by neutrophils can contribute to dysfunction and injury in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>release</b> <b>of</b> endotoxins produced by bacteria, sepsis, trauma, alcoholic hepatitis, ischemia, and hypovolemic shock resulting from acute hemorrhage.|$|E
