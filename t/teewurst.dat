50|$|Up to 1945, {{the sausage}} {{industry}} in Rügenwalde was well established, and <b>Teewurst</b> was its best-known product. In 1927, the term Rügenwalder <b>Teewurst</b> was declared a Protected designation of origin. After World War II, sausage makers from Rügenwalde fled or were expelled to the Federal Republic of Germany, where they established new companies and resumed {{the production of}} <b>Teewurst.</b> They established an association of former Rügenwald sausage makers, which registered the trademark Rügenwalder <b>Teewurst</b> in 1957. Today, only companies that once had their headquarters in Rügenwalde are allowed {{to use the term}} Rügenwalder <b>Teewurst.</b> All others use the terms <b>Teewurst</b> or Rügenwalde-style <b>Teewurst.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Teewurst</b> is a German sausage {{made from}} two parts raw pork (and {{sometimes}} beef) and one part bacon; they are minced, seasoned and packed in casings (mostly porous artificial casings) before being smoked over beech wood. The sausage then has to mature for seven to ten days {{in order to}} develop its typical taste. <b>Teewurst</b> contains 30 to 40 percent fat, which makes it particularly easy to spread.|$|E
50|$|The German name Rügenwalde {{was best}} known in Germany for the {{production}} of the Rügenwalder <b>Teewurst</b> in the town; after World War II the production was restarted in West Germany under the old name.|$|E
50|$|<b>Teewurst</b> {{was invented}} in Pomerania, {{probably}} in the small Baltic town of Rügenwalde (now Darłowo, Poland), {{in the middle of}} the 19th century. The name, which means tea sausage, is said to derive from the habit of serving it in sandwiches at teatime.|$|E
5000|$|Fresh smoked {{sausages}} {{are fresh}} sausages that are smoked and cured. They do not normally require refrigeration {{and do not}} require any further cooking before eating. Examples include Mettwurst and <b>Teewurst</b> which are meat preparations packed in sausage casing but squeezed out of it (just like any other spread from a tube).|$|E
50|$|Mettwurst is a {{strongly}} flavoured German sausage, made from raw minced pork which is preserved by curing and smoking, often with garlic. The southern German variety {{is soft and}} similar to <b>Teewurst.</b> Braunschweiger mettwurst is smoked somewhat but still soft and spreadable, while other northern German varieties such as the Holsteiner are harder and more akin to salami, due to longer smoking. The Low German word mett, meaning minced pork without bacon, {{is derived from the}} Old Saxon word meti (meaning food), and is related to the English word 'meat'. Mettwurst can be prepared and eaten a variety of ways, such as cooked or fried or spread on rye bread with onions and eaten raw. When minced raw pork is prepared without curing or smoking, it is called simply Mett.|$|E
40|$|Modern {{consumers}} {{are interested in}} the use of non-chemical methods to control pathogens when heat sterilization is not an option. Such is the case with <b>teewurst</b> sausage, a raw spreadable sausage and a popular German commodity. Although Listeria was not found in <b>teewurst,</b> the optimal microbial growing conditions of <b>teewurst</b> coupled with the ubiquity of L. monocytogenes in nature, makes the possibility of contamination of products very possible. This pilot study was conducted to examine teewurst’s native micro-flora’s ability to suppress the outgrowth of L. monocytogenes at 10 °C using standard plate counts and PCR-DGGE. Traditional plating methods showed L. monocytogenes growth significantly decreased when in competition with the teewurst’s native micro-flora (p < 0. 05). The native micro-flora of the <b>teewurst</b> suppressed the overall growth of L. monocytogenes by an average of two logs, under these conditions. Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) amplicons with unique banding patterns were extracted from DGGE gel for identification. Brochothrix thermosphacta and Lactobacillus curvatus were identified {{as a part of the}} teewurst’s native micro-flora. Although the native micro-flora did not decrease L. monocytogenes to below limits of detection, it was enough of a decrease to warrant further investigation...|$|E
40|$|The fate of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium, or Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 were {{separately}} monitored {{both in and}} on <b>teewurst,</b> {{a traditional}} raw and spreadable sausage of Germanic origin. Multi-strain cocktails of each pathogen (ca. 5. 0 log CFU/g) were used to separately inoculate <b>teewurst</b> that was subsequently stored at 1. 5, 4, 10, and 21 °C. When inoculated into commercially-prepared batter just prior to stuffing, in general, the higher the storage temperature, the greater the lethality. Depending on the storage temperature, pathogen levels in the batter decreased by 2. 3 to 3. 4, ca. 3. 8, and 2. 2 to 3. 6 log CFU/g for E. coli O 157 :H 7, S. Typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes, respectively, during storage for 30 days. When inoculated onto both {{the top and bottom}} faces of sliced commercially-prepared finished product, the results for all four temperatures showed a decrease of 0. 9 to 1. 4, 1. 4 to 1. 8, and 2. 2 to 3. 0 log CFU/g for E. coli O 157 :H 7, S. Typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes, respectively, over the course of 21 days. With the possible exceptions for salt and carbohydrate levels, chemical analyses of <b>teewurst</b> purchased from five commercial manufacturers revealed only subtle differences in proximate composition for this product type. Our data establish that <b>teewurst</b> does not provide a favourable environment for the survival of E. coli O 157 :H 7, S. Typhimurium, or L. monocytogenes inoculated either into or onto the product...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of {{the fate of}} microbial foodborne pathogens in foods is of great concern for anyone involved in the food chain. Factors that may influence microbial responses in foods and food environments, such as food structure and composition, microbial interactions and mode of growth were identified and assessed in the present study. The fate of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 was monitored both in and on <b>teewurst,</b> a raw spreadable sausage, at different storage temperatures. Regardless of the storage temperature and inoculation type, pathogen numbers decreased during storage. The increase of endogenous lactic acid bacteria and the concomitant reduction of pH mostly accounted for this reduction. The inactivation of all three pathogens inoculated into batter or onto slices varied considerably among trials possibly due to variations in the initial batch-to-batch levels of lactic acid microflora and the associated microbial interactions. The effect of structure, composition and microbial interactions on the growth kinetics of L. monocytogenes was evaluated in different growth substrates, including broth, agar, sterile meat blocks, naturally contaminated meat blocks and minced meat. The growth responses of L. monocytogenes were significantly different in the different growth media and food products tested. These differences were more pronounced at low temperatures. The validation of a model {{based on data from}} broth against the observed growth of the pathogen {{in the rest of the}} tested media showed that broth models may result in significant prediction errors. The potential for mono- or multi-strain cultures of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 to attach and form biofilm in combinations of food-contact surfaces, growth substrates and storage temperatures was examined. The susceptibility of biofilms to sanitizers was also evaluated. Attachment and biofilm formation was strain dependent. The presence of food residues (liquid or solid) facilitated the attachment/transfer of E. coli O 157 :H 7 on food-contact surfaces. At moderately cold temperatures culture broth was more conducive to subsequent growth. At chill temperatures the presence of natural microflora in liquid residues enhanced further attachment of the pathogen. Biofilms were less susceptible to sanitation treatments as compared to planktonic cells. Biofilm cells surviving sanitation were able to survive and present slight increases at refrigeration and abuse temperatures, respectively, in cross-contaminated ground meat. Acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs) and autoinducer- 2 (AI- 2) signalling molecules in the cell-free supernatants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica-like, Serratia proteamaculans and a mixture of two Yersinia enterocolitica strains were found to affect the growth kinetics of two Salmonella Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium strains, respectively. P. aeruginosa synthesized quorum sensing signals that accelerated the metabolic activity of Salmonella strains. All other quorated bacteria tested had a negative effect on both initiation of growth and metabolic activity. The effect seems to be strain and QS signal dependent.
