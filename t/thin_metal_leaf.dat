25|$|Jewellery in Mesopotamia {{tended to}} be {{manufactured}} from <b>thin</b> <b>metal</b> <b>leaf</b> and was set {{with large numbers of}} brightly coloured stones (chiefly agate, lapis, carnelian, and jasper). Favoured shapes included leaves, spirals, cones, and bunches of grapes. Jewellers created works both for human use and for adorning statues and idols. They employed a wide variety of sophisticated metalworking techniques, such as cloisonné, engraving, fine granulation, and filigree.|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} was first seen in Chinese ceramics in Cizhou stoneware from {{as early as}} the 12th century, with use on porcelain following within a century, though it did not become predominant until later, and the full possibilities were not realized until the 17th century. Some techniques use <b>thin</b> <b>metal</b> <b>leaf</b> as well as the more usual pigments, which are typically applied in a liquid or paste form, painted by brush, or using stencils or transfer printing.|$|E

50|$|Gold leaf {{is a type}} of <b>metal</b> <b>leaf,</b> but {{the term}} is rarely used when {{referring}} to gold <b>leaf.</b> The term <b>metal</b> <b>leaf</b> is normally used for <b>thin</b> sheets of <b>metal</b> of any color that do not contain any real gold. Pure gold is 24 karats. Real yellow gold leaf is about 91.7% pure gold. Silver colored white gold is approximately 50% pure gold.|$|R
50|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>leaf,</b> {{also called}} {{composition}} leaf or schlagmetal, {{is a thin}} foil used for decoration. <b>Metal</b> <b>leaf</b> can come in many different shades. Some <b>metal</b> <b>leaf</b> may look like gold leaf but does not contain any real gold. This <b>metal</b> <b>leaf</b> {{is often referred to}} as imitation leaf.|$|R
50|$|A foil {{is a very}} <b>thin</b> {{sheet of}} <b>metal,</b> usually made by {{hammering}} or rolling. Foils are most easily made with malleable metals, such as aluminium, copper, tin, and gold. Foils usually bend under their own weight and can be torn easily. The more malleable a <b>metal,</b> the <b>thinner</b> foil {{can be made with}} it. For example, aluminium foil is usually about 1/1000 inch (0.03 mm), whereas gold (more malleable than aluminium) can be made into foil only a few atoms thick, called gold leaf. Extremely thin foil is called <b>metal</b> <b>leaf.</b> Leaf tears very easily and must be picked up with special brushes.|$|R
50|$|As well, {{some types}} of metal sheds that have thin walls are easily dented, which may makes {{some types of}} <b>thin</b> <b>metal</b> sheds a poor choice for vandal-prone areas or for {{high-traffic}} activities such as small businesses. In cold climates, <b>metal</b> sheds with <b>thin</b> walls need to have snow and ice cleared from the roof, because the <b>thin</b> <b>metal</b> may be damaged by a heavy accumulation. Since <b>thin</b> <b>metal</b> sheds weigh much less than wood or PVC plastic sheds, <b>thin</b> <b>metal</b> sheds are more {{at risk of being}} damaged by heavy winds. To prevent wind damage, <b>thin</b> <b>metal</b> sheds should be attached to a concrete foundation with screws. In countries where the climate is generally mild, such as Australia, very large metal sheds are used for many types of industry. Corrugated metal sheds may be better able to withstand wind and snow loads, as the corrugated shape makes the metal stronger than flat tin.|$|R
2500|$|The {{threshold}} voltage is tuned by including a thin [...] "work function metal" [...] layer between the high-κ dielectric {{and the main}} metal. This layer is thin enough that the total work function of the gate is influenced by both the main <b>metal</b> and <b>thin</b> <b>metal</b> work functions (either due to alloying during annealing, or simply due to the incomplete screening by the <b>thin</b> <b>metal).</b> The {{threshold voltage}} thus can be tuned by {{the thickness of the}} <b>thin</b> <b>metal</b> layer.|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} joining a woven {{flexible}} ceramic fabric and a <b>thin</b> <b>metal</b> sheet creating an integral metal surfaced flexible thermal protection article, which methods compress: placing multiple dots of high temperature metallic or fabric and the <b>thin</b> <b>metal</b> sheet {{in a random}} or organized pattern, {{with the proviso that}} the brazing material covers about 10 % or less of the surface of one flat side of the metal sheet; heating the flexible ceramic fabric, brazing material and <b>thin</b> <b>metal</b> sheet for a predetermined period of time to integrally connect the same; and cooling the formed flexible article to ambient temperature.

40|$|Considerable {{interest}} has been expressed of late concerning the transparency of <b>thin</b> <b>metal</b> films to electrons with energies {{of a few}} electron volts above the Fermi level. (1 - 4) In the present experiments, information concerning the mean free path for loss of energy in gold is determined directly from measurements of electron transport. The technique used is that of tunnel emission(3, 4) in which electrons are caused to tunnel from a metal substrate through a thin insulating layer into a <b>thin</b> <b>metal</b> electrode through which a certain number pass into a vacuum where they are collected. Measurement of the relative number transmitted through the <b>thin</b> <b>metal</b> layer {{as a function of}} the thickness of the layer yields a direct measurement of the energy mean free path...|$|R

40|$|We {{recently}} {{investigated the}} van der Waals force between <b>thin</b> <b>metal</b> films. Under certain conditions this force decrease with separation to a fractional power. In the present work we use optical data of metals and the zero-temperature Lifshitz formalism {{to demonstrate a}} retardation effect. The retarded attraction between <b>thin</b> <b>metal</b> films may be larger than the nonretarded attraction. This property is related to a comparatively weak retardation dependence of the energy that originates from the transverse magnetic modes. At separations where the transverse electric modes give a significant contribution, the net effect can actually be an increased attraction. This effect vanishes with increasing film thickness and with increasing dissipation.
