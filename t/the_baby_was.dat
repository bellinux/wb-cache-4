5|$|Benny Chan {{described}} the filming process {{as some of}} the darkest days of his career, explaining that <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day. Whenever a scene involving <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> shot, the crew members had to be silent, communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money to guide the baby through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used to coax the baby into co-operation. One scene required the baby to suckle Chan's nipple. <b>The</b> <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of honey onto the nipple.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) and her husband, {{state senator}} Robert (Jack Coleman), welcome their new baby, also named Phillip. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Gabe all visit Angela at the hospital. According to Angela, <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> born prematurely, {{but due to}} the size, Oscar deduces that Angela lied about the date of conception. Angela admits that <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> {{conceived}} a month before her wedding, and makes them promise not to tell anyone. Suspecting that Dwight is the real father, Oscar breaks his promise and tells him when he arrives at the hospital in search of Gabe. Dwight barges in on Angela and her husband and begins thoroughly examining the child. When the senator leaves, Dwight confronts Angela about the child, claiming that it is his. She refutes his claim, but Dwight leaves satisfied, telling the attending nurse to call off the baby's circumcision, which the nonplussed nurse refuses to do. Upon returning to Dunder Mifflin he drops his dispute with Jim, since his self-assumed fatherhood has given him a new appreciation for the duties of parenthood. The episode ends with Dwight putting a decal on his car, {{in honor of his}} covert new family member.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Babies</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> debut studio album by American indie {{rock band}} <b>The</b> <b>Babies.</b> It <b>was</b> {{released}} in February 14, 2011 by Shrimper Records.|$|R
50|$|Difficult labor {{may occur}} because <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> {{abnormally}} large (macrosomia), because the mother’s pelvis or birth canal is small or deformed, or because <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> in an abnormal presentation {{for the birth}} (such as breech or transverse presentation).|$|R
50|$|The Occipito-Anterior {{position}} {{is ideal for}} birth - it means that <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> lined up so as to fit through the pelvis as easily as possible. <b>The</b> <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> head down, facing the spine, with his back {{on one side of}} the front of the tummie. In this position, <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> chin <b>is</b> tucked onto his chest, so that the smallest part of his head will be applied to the cervix first. The {{position is}} usually 'Left Occiput Anterior' or LOA - occasionally <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> may <b>be</b> Right Occiput Anterior or ROA.|$|R
5|$|The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), {{also known}} as <b>the</b> <b>Baby,</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} as a test-bed for the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory, {{rather than as a}} practical computer. Work on the machine began in 1947, and on 21 June 1948 the computer successfully ran its first program, consisting of 17 instructions written to find the highest proper factor of 218 (262,144) by trying every integer from 218 − 1 downwards. The program ran for 52minutes before producing the correct answer of 131,072.|$|E
5|$|Bishop Compton officiated at {{the wedding}} of Anne and George of Denmark on 28 July 1683 in the Chapel Royal. Though it was an {{arranged}} marriage, they were faithful and devoted partners. They were given a set of buildings, known as the Cockpit, in the Palace of Whitehall as their London residence, and Sarah Churchill was appointed one of Anne's ladies of the bedchamber. Within months of the marriage, Anne was pregnant, but <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> stillborn in May. Anne recovered at the spa town of Tunbridge Wells, {{and over the next}} two years, gave birth to two daughters in quick succession: Mary and Anne Sophia.|$|E
5|$|Passport to Pimlico {{explores the}} spirit and unity of wartime London in a post-war context and offers an {{examination}} of the English character. Like other of the Ealing comedies, the film pits a small group of British against a series of changes to the status quo from an external agent. The story was an original concept by the screenwriter T. E. B. Clarke. He was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government so that when Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth, <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> born on Dutch territory, and would not lose her right to the throne.|$|E

5|$|Arthur became Duke of Cornwall at birth. Four {{days after}} his birth, <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> baptised at Winchester Cathedral by the Bishop of Worcester, John Alcock, and his baptism was {{immediately}} followed by his Confirmation. John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby, William FitzAlan, 16th Earl of Arundel, Queen Elizabeth Woodville and Cecily of York served as godparents; the latter two, his grandmother and aunt respectively, carried the prince during the ceremony. Initially, Arthur's nursery in Farnham was headed by Elizabeth Darcy, who had served as chief nurse for Edward IV's children, including Arthur's own mother. After Arthur was created Prince of Wales in 1490, he was awarded a household structure {{at the behest of}} his father. Over the next thirteen years, Henry VII and Elizabeth would have six more children, of whom only three – Margaret, Henry and Mary – would reach adulthood. Arthur was especially close to his sister Margaret (b. 1489) and his brother Henry (b. 1491), with whom he shared a nursery.|$|E
5|$|Following {{these deaths}} Lie {{was unable to}} support his wife. He {{therefore}} sold his school to Oey Kim Hoat and left his position at Zending Press {{to take a job}} as a land surveyor. In the next four years he held various jobs. In 1881 Oey Pek Nio gave birth again. She died soon afterwards and <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> sent to live with her grandfather father in Gadog, a village to the southeast of Buitenzorg, to be raised. The child died in 1886. Lie published his first books in 1884. Two of these, Kitab Edja and Sobat Anak-Anak, were published by Zending Press. The former was a study book to help students learn to write Malay, while the latter was a collection of stories for children that Aprinus Salam of Gadjah Mada University credits as the first work of popular literature in the Indies. The other two books were published by W. Bruining&Co., based in the colonial capital at Batavia (now Jakarta). One of these, Malajoe Batawi, was a grammar of Malay intended to standardise the language's spelling. The other was the four-volume syair (a traditional Malay form of poetry) Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari; this book, dealing with a gender-disguised warrior who conquers the Sultanate of Hindustan to save her husband, became one of Lie's best-known works.|$|E
5|$|In December 1818, the Shelleys {{travelled}} {{south with}} Claire Clairmont and their servants to Naples, where they stayed for three months, receiving only one visitor, a physician. In 1820, {{they found themselves}} plagued by accusations and threats from Paolo and Elise Foggi, former servants whom Percy Shelley had dismissed in Naples shortly after the Foggis had married. The pair revealed that on 27 February 1819 in Naples, Percy Shelley had registered as his child by Mary Shelley a two-month-old baby girl named Elena Adelaide Shelley. The Foggis also claimed that Claire Clairmont was the baby's mother. Biographers have offered various interpretations of these events: that Percy Shelley decided to adopt a local child; that <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> his by Elise, Claire, or an unknown woman; or that she was Elise's by Byron. Mary Shelley insisted she would have known if Claire had been pregnant, but {{it is unclear how}} much she really knew. The events in Naples, a city Mary Shelley later called a paradise inhabited by devils, remain shrouded in mystery. The only certainty is that she herself was not the child’s mother. Elena Adelaide Shelley died in Naples on 9 June 1820.|$|E

5|$|The {{plot was}} an {{original}} story by T. E. B. Clarke, {{a writer of}} both comedy and drama scripts for Ealing; his other screenplays for the studio include Hue and Cry (1947), Against the Wind (1948), The Blue Lamp (1950), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953). Clarke was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government {{so that when the}} then-Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth to Princess Margriet of the Netherlands, <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> born on international territory, thus not on Canadian territory (though not on Dutch territory), and would not lose her right to the throne. The airlift of food supplies into the Burgundian enclave was influenced by the flights of food and supplies during the Berlin Blockade of June 1948 – May 1949. The music for the film was composed by Georges Auric, who had been involved in several other productions for Ealing Studios.|$|E
