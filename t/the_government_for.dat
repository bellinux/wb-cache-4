The results show that: (i) regardless of <b>the</b> <b>government’s</b> preference <b>for</b> tax revenues, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> {{does not have an}} incentive to privatize in an endogenous timing context even though there are conflicts of interest between the public firm and <b>the</b> <b>government</b> and (ii) under a mixed duopoly, each sequential-move equilibrium varies with the level of <b>the</b> <b>government’s</b> prefer-ence <b>for</b> tax revenues...|$|R

5|$|Many {{of these}} forms of {{assimilation}} are still at work today. For example, when a central authority nationalizes one language, that attaches economic and social advantages to the prestige language. As generations pass, use of the indigenous language often fades or disappears, and linguistic and cultural identity recede as well. However, some groups are seeking to revive their indigenous identities. One important political aspect of this pursuit is petitioning <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>for</b> official recognition as a separate and distinct ethnic group.|$|E
