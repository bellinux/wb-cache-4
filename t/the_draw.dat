5|$|The Third Test of the 1948 Ashes {{series was}} one of five Tests in a cricket series between teams {{representing}} Australia and England.

40|$|Friction aided {{deep drawing}} using a {{polyurethane}} ring as a pressure medium has been analyzed by the slab {{and the energy}} methods to understand the main features {{of the process and}} to find the optimum conditions to achieve successful <b>drawing.</b> <b>The</b> effect of an auxiliary metal punch on the stress distribution of the deformed blank and the increase in height of <b>the</b> <b>drawn</b> cup is also discussed. From these studies, the reason why the unusual circumferential crack occurs at the flange of the deformed blank has been clarified, based on the radial stress distribution of the deformed blank. A process parameter, which denotes <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> characteristics of <b>the</b> friction aided deep drawing, has been proposed. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> region diagram has been presented to facilitate <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> pressure control with the progress of <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> process. It is shown that <b>the</b> successful <b>drawing</b> region is narrow at the early stage of drawing, although it becomes wide as <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> proceeds. Therefore, in the early stage of drawing, special care should be paid to <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> pressure control to avoid the flange crack. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

5|$|Brown is {{credited}} {{with a number of}} American football innovations. He was the first coach to use game film to scout opponents, hire a full-time staff of assistants, and test players on their knowledge of a playbook. He invented the modern face mask, the taxi squad and <b>the</b> <b>draw</b> play. He also played a role in breaking professional football's color barrier, bringing some of the first African-Americans to play pro football in the modern era onto his teams. Despite these accomplishments, Brown was not universally liked. He was strict and controlling, which often brought him into conflict with players who wanted a greater say in play-calling. These disputes, combined with Brown's failure to consult Modell on major personnel decisions, led to his firing as the Browns' coach in 1963.|$|E
40|$|Drawing {{involves}} frequent {{shifts of}} gaze between {{the original and}} <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> and visual memory helps compare the original object and <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> across these gaze shifts while creating and correcting <b>the</b> <b>drawing.</b> It remains unclear whether this memory encodes all of the object or only the features around <b>the</b> current <b>drawing</b> position and whether both the original and the copy are equally well represented. To address these questions, we designed a "drawing" experiment coupled with a change detection task. A polygon was displayed on one screen and participants had to copy it on another, with the original and <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> presented in alternation. At unpredictable moments during the copying process, modifications were made on <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> and <b>the</b> original figure (while they were not in view).
