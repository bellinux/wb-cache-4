5|$|According to Di Tella and Zymelman (1967), {{the main}} {{difference}} between Argentina and other settler societies such as Australia and Canada was its failure to seek adequate alternatives to compensate for the end of geographical expansion with the definitive closing of the frontier.

5|$|As it was {{the middle}} of the Chinese New Year, most of the Chinese Volunteers Corps were on leave, leaving Singapore almost defenceless against the mutiny. The British {{government}} was caught unprepared, and other mutineers went on a killing spree at Keppel Harbour and Pasir Panjang, killing 18 European and local civilians. Martial law was imposed and every available man from HMS Cadmus went ashore to join with British, Malay and Chinese Volunteer units and <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> British regular troops forming part of the garrison. British Vice-Admiral Sir Martyn Jerram sent a radio message requesting help from any allied warships nearby.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} undeciphered scripts, {{there are many}} fanciful interpretations and claimed {{translations}} of rongorongo. However, apart from a portion of one tablet which {{has been shown to}} have to do with a lunar Rapa Nui calendar, none of the texts are understood. There are three serious obstacles to decipherment, assuming rongorongo is truly writing: <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> remaining texts, the lack of context such as illustrations in which to interpret them, and the poor attestation of the Old Rapanui language, since modern Rapanui is heavily mixed with Tahitian and is therefore unlikely to closely reflect the language of the tablets.|$|E

5|$|In Europe and the Americas, a {{relatively}} small number of DPB cases have been reported in Asian immigrants and residents, as well as in individuals of non-Asian ancestry. Misdiagnosis has occurred in the West owing to less recognition of the disease than in Asian countries. Relative to the large number of Asians living in the west, <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> them thought to be affected by DPB suggests non-genetic factors may play some role in its cause. This rarity seen in Western Asians may also be partly associated with misdiagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The breed gained {{official}} {{recognition from}} the Canadian Kennel Club in January 1980 {{after five years}} of collecting pedigrees, gathering support, and lobbying officials by two breeders and enthusiasts. <b>The</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Australian Cattle Dogs in Canada at the time were primarily working dogs on farms and ranches scattered across large distances. However, the fledgling breed club held conformation shows, obedience and agility competitions, and entered their dogs in sports including flyball and lure coursing. At the end of 1980, Landmaster Carina was named the first Australian Cattle Dog in Canada to gain both her conformation and obedience titles.|$|E
