40|$|Our work at Ireland’s National Rehabilitation Hospital {{involves}} designing {{communication systems}} for {{people suffering from}} profound physical disabilities. One such system uses the electro-oculogram, which is an (x,y) system of voltages picked up by pairs of electrodes placed, respectively, above and below and {{on either side of}} the eyes. The eyeball has a dc polarisation between cornea and back, arising from the photoreceptor rods and cones in the retina. As the eye rotates, the varying voltages projected onto the electrodes drive a cursor over a mimic keyboard on a computer screen. Symbols are selected with a switching action derived, for example, from a blink. Experience in using this mode of communication has given us limited facilities to study the eye position control system. We present here a resulting new feedback model for rotation in either the vertical or the horizontal plane, which involves the eyeball controlled by an agonist-antagonist muscle pair, modelled by a single equivalent bidirectional muscle with <b>torque</b> falling <b>off</b> linearly with angular velocity.

40|$|Abstract Switched {{reluctance}} motor (SRM) drive has remarkable characteristics {{that make it}} attractive for high-speed applications. As the motor’s speed increases {{the shape of the}} current waveform changes in such way that limits the production of motoring torque. At high speeds, it is possible for the phase current never reaches the desired value due to the self e. m. f. of the motor, therefore, the <b>torque</b> falls <b>off.</b> In order to remedy this problem, the phase turn on angle is advanced in such way that the phase commutation begins sooner. Advancing the commutation angle offers the advantages of getting the current into the phase winding while the inductance of the phase is low, and also of having a little more time to get the current out of the phase winding before the rotor reaches the negative torque region. Since the SRM drive is a variable speed motor then, the amount of advancing for the turn on angle should be accomplished automatically according to the speed of the motor, meaning, as the motor speed increases so should the turn on angle and vice versa. In this respect, this paper introduces an electronic governor using a P. L. L. module in conjunction with a micro controller to achieve this task for a desired speed/advancement angle profile, which is considered to be linear in this study. The governor causes 0 - 14 degrees automatic adjustment in the turn on angle from stand still to a pre-set speed for a SR motor. A linear analysis of the curren...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{aimed to}} develop an undemanding test for {{endurance}} capacity of the knee extensor muscles, which can also be applied to frail participants. We hypothesized 1) that the first objective indications for peripheral fatigue during incremental unilateral repetitive isometric knee extensor contractions {{could be used to}} assess a fatigue threshold (FT), 2) that torque at FT would depend on training status, and 3) that this torque could easily be sustained for 30 min. METHODS: Five trained and five untrained participants performed 5 -min bouts of 60 repetitive contractions (3 -s on and 2 -s <b>off).</b> <b>Torque,</b> set at 25 % maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), was increased by 5 % MVC in subsequent bouts. The highest torque for which rectified surface EMG remained stable during the bout was defined as the FT. On separate occasions, 30 -min bouts were performed at and above the FT to assess sustainable torque. Changes in gas exchange parameters, HR, and RPE were monitored to corroborate FT. RESULTS: At FT (RPE = 5. 7 ± 1. 7), torque was higher (P < 0. 05) in trained (41. 4 % ± 5. 8 % MVC) than in untrained participants (30. 5 % ± 1. 8 % MVC). Sustainable torque was ~ 4 % higher than (P < 0. 05) and significantly related to FT (...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedIn this investigation, fluid {{dynamics}} of a spherical particle in a rotating liquid sphere is studied. Such problems arise during protein crystal growth by the containerless approach {{in which a}} drop of protein solution is levitated against gravity, and rotated steadily by a torque from an acoustic field. Viscosity of the solution {{is assumed to be}} sufficiently high such that viscous force dominates and the second-order effects in the acoustic field do not penetrate the drop surface. The analysis is carried out at very small Reynolds and Taylor numbers for which the fluid flow is treated by Stokes approximation. With a given geometric configuration, the velocity field is calculated and used to determine the particle velocity at a given time. By integrating the particle velocity, the particle path is obtained and used for optimizing the rotation rate of the drop in an attempt to keep the particle fully contained in the drop.; In addition, the transient dynamics of a rotating levitated liquid drop in unbounded gaseous fluid is investigated. A liquid drop is considered to experience two different fundamental transients, one when the <b>torque</b> is turned <b>off</b> and another when the torque is turned on. The motion of the fluids in the drop interior and surroundings is described by the Stokes equations with the time-derivative term included. The solutions are obtained analytically by the Laplace transform technique. The results show that the transient effects caused by the applied torque are relatively small for the high-viscosity solution considered. Hence, for most applications of containerless protein crystal growth, the liquid drop may be assumed to rotate like a solid body while allowing the solid particle relative motion within that framework...|$|R
40|$|Similar to {{biological}} human ankle, today's {{commercially available}} powered ankle-foot prostheses can vary impedance and deliver net positive ankle work. These commercially available prostheses are intrinsically controlled. Users cannot intuitively change ankle controller's behavior to perform movements {{that are not}} part of the repetitive walking gait cycle. For example, when transition from level ground walking to descending stairs, user cannot intuitively initiate or control the amount of ankle angle deflexion for a more normative stair descent gait pattern. This paper presents a hybrid controller that adds myoelectric control functionality to an existing intrinsic controller. The system employs input from both mechanical sensors on the ankle as well as myoelectric signals from gastrocnemius muscle of the user. This control scheme lets the user to modulate the gain of command ankle <b>torque</b> upon push <b>off</b> during level ground walking and stair ascent. It also allows the user to interrupt level ground walking control cycle and initiate ankle plantar flexion during stair descent. As a preliminary study, ankle characteristics such as ankle angle and torque were measured and compared to biological ankle characteristics. Results show that the proposed hybrid controller can maintain existing controller's biomimetic characteristics. In addition, it can also recognize to a qualitative extent the intended command torque for ankle push off and user's desire to switch between control modalities for different terrains. The study shows that it is possible and desirable to use neural signals as control signals for prosthetic leg controllers.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} measurements {{characterizing the}} static and dynamic {{performance of a}} BFB configured with shims of two thicknesses (30 ?m and 50 ?m). Parameters of interest include drag <b>torque,</b> rotor lift <b>off</b> speed, and the estimation of force coefficients of a BFB with shims (30 ?m and 50 ?m thick). The thesis also compares those results {{to those of the}} original BFB (without shims). Drag torque measurements during shaft acceleration tests up to 50 krpm show that the lift off speed of both the original bearing and the shimmed bearing increases linearly with applied unit load (W/(LD)). The bearing startup friction factor f=T/(RW) during dry sliding condition for the original bearing (f~ 0. 3) is constant with applied load (W/(LD)), while the bearing in shimmed configurations show a larger friction factor that decreases with load (W/(LD)). Once airborne, a bearing in all three configurations (shimmed and not shimmed) show a similar low (f~ 0. 05 at W/(LD) ~ 20 kPa) friction factor that decreases with increasing load. Bearing dynamic force coefficients are estimated over a frequency range of 200 - 450 Hz, under a specific load ~ 14. 3 kPa. The shims have an unremarkable effect on the foil bearing direct stiffness coefficients. The shimmed BFB shows increased direct damping coefficients (in particular along the static load direction and at high frequencies) while operating at 50 krpm. The energy dissipated is best characterized with a structural loss factor ?, a function of the bearing elastic (K) properties, and the sliding friction characteristics. Over the narrow arbitrary frequency range from 300 - 400 Hz and for dynamic motions of amplitude of 20 ?m, the bearing without shims offers a ?? 25 % larger than the original bearing, demonstrating that the shimmed bearing dissipates more mechanical energy, albeit the standard deviation in the average loss factor of the shimmed bearings is much larger. Measurements of the turbocharger (TC) shaft vibration conducted as the shaft accelerates toward 50 krpm (833 Hz) show that a shimmed BFB reduced subsynchronous whirl motions of the TC shaft apparent with the original BFB (WFR~ 0. 30). When supported on a BFB with 50 ?m shims, the TC shaft operates free of subsynchronous whirl motions. Shimming, therefore is a simple, economical way of increasing energy dissipation in BFBs thereby improving their rotordynamic performance. Alas shimming also offers some undesirable characteristics such as higher startup torque requirements. Note however, that once airborne, the drag friction factor of a shimmed BFB {{is similar to that of}} the original bearing...|$|R
40|$|Metal mesh foil {{bearings}} (MMFBs) are {{a promising}} low cost gas bearing technology for support of high speed oil-free microturbomachinery. Elimination of complex oil lubrication and sealing system by installing MMFBs in oil free rotating machinery offer distinctive advantages such as reduced system overall weight, enhanced reliability at high rotational speeds and extreme temperatures, and extended maintenance intervals compared to conventional turbo machines. MMFBs for oil-free turbomachinery must demonstrate adequate load capacity, reliable rotordynamic performance, and low frictional losses {{in a high}} temperature environment. The thesis presents the measurements of MMFB break-away <b>torque,</b> rotor lift <b>off</b> and touchdown speeds, temperature at increasing static load conditions, and identified stiffness and equivalent viscous damping coefficients. The experiments, conducted in a test rig driven by an automotive turbocharger turbine, demonstrate the airborne operation (hydrodynamic gas film) of the floating test MMFB with little frictional loses at increasing loads. The measured drag torque peaks when the rotor starts and stops, and drops significantly once the bearing is airborne. The estimated rotor speed for lift-off increases linearly with increasing applied loads. During continuous operation, the MMFB temperature measured {{at one end of}} the back surface of the top foil increases both with rotor speed and static load. Nonetheless, the temperature rise is only nominal ensuring reliable bearing performance. Application of a sacrificial layer of solid lubricant on the top foil surface aids to reduce the rotor break-away torque. The measurements give confidence on this simple bearing technology for ready application into oil-free turbomachinery. Impact loads delivered (with a soft tip) to the test bearing, while resting on the (stationary) drive shaft, evidence a system with large damping and a structural stiffness that increases with frequency (max. 200 Hz). The system equivalent viscous damping ratio decreases from ~ 0. 7 to 0. 2 as the frequency increases. In general, the viscous damping in a metal mesh structure is of structural type and inversely proportional to the frequency and amplitude of bearing motion relative to the shaft. Impact load tests, conducted while the shaft rotates at 50 krpm, show that the bearing direct stiffness is lower (~ 25 % at 200 Hz) than the bearing structural stiffness identified from impact load tests without shaft rotation. However, the identified equivalent viscous damping coefficients from tests with and without shaft rotation are nearly identical. The orbits of bearing motion relative to the rotating shaft show subsynchronous motion amplitudes and also backward synchronous whirl. The subsynchronous vibration amplitudes are locked at a frequency, nearly identical to a rotor natural frequency. A backward synchronous whirl occurs while the rotor speed is between any two natural frequencies, arising due to bearing stiffness asymmetry...|$|R

Sistemin kontrolü motor ile sürülen tekerlek ile sağlanır. Sürülen tekerlek ivmelenerek tüm sistemde eylemsizliğinden dolayı bir tork oluşturur ve oluşan bu tork sistemin salınıma geçmesini sağlar. Sistemin yüksek simetriye sahip olması dinamik modellemesinin daha rahat çıkarılmasına ve daha kolay analiz edilmesine sebep olur. Dinamik modellemesinin daha rahat yapılmasının yanı sıra sisteme ileri düzey kontrol metotları (geribeslemeli lineerleştirme metodu, enerji tabanlı salınım kontrolü ve hibrid kontrol gibi) da uygulanabilmektedir. Ayrıca, lineer olmayan bir davranış sergilediğinden ve eksik tahrikli olduğundan literatürdeki çalışmaların ilgi odağı olmaktadır. Bu çalışmada, ilk olarak tekerlekli sarkaç ile ilgili genel bilgiler verilmiş ve daha sonra tekerlekli sarkaç sistemi ile ilgili literatür taramaları incelenmiş ve tezin genel hatları ile ilgili bilgi verilmiştir.

Reaction Wheel Pendulum or Inertia Wheel Pendulum as {{known in}} {{literature}} was first mentioned in 1999 by Prof. Mark W. Spong. In experiment, unactuated pendulum coupled to highly symmetric wheel {{driven by a}} DC motor. The unactuated pendulum is controlled by this actuated wheel. Actuation of the wheel creates angular acceleration due to torque generated by the DC motor. This torque causes the pendulum to swing up. Dynamic model needs to be obtained to control the system. In addition to this, advanced control methods such as feedback linearization, energy based control and hybrid control can be applied. Moreover, reaction wheel pendulum has non-linear property {{and it is an}} underactuated system. Thus, reaction wheel pendulum has been an attraction center in literature. In this study, general information is given about underactuated systems and the reaction wheel pendulum. Moreover, the literature investigation and general scheme of thesis are displayed in introduction. In second chapter, product design and manufacture are discussed. Later on, chapter three explains how to derive dynamic model of reaction wheel pendulum with Euler-Lagrange method that depends on system energy. Subsequently, control methods of reaction pendulum are given. Then, coorperating reaction wheel pendulums with elastic load is shown in future work. Finally, conclusion of this study is given. In introduction, basic information about underactuated systems, such as what it is and why it is important, is given. Besides, definition of the reaction wheel pendulum is declared. For instance, what the reaction wheel pendulum is, how it works and why it is important. Afterwards, literature investigations which give knowledge about control, linearization and stability analysis methods of underactuated pendulums are explained. First, swing up control with Lyapunov funtion is mentioned. Basic of this method is to select approptiate Lyapunov function. This selection is usually done depending on total energy of the system. Its aim is to swing up the pendulum from down to up equilibrium point. Second, some linarization methods are given for underactuated pendulums. One of them is a conventional method. With this method, dynamic model of the pendulum is linearized using Taylor series. According to this, pendulum can be controled in up equilibrium point. The other method is feedback linearization. In this method, proper output function is selected. Then, between input and output functions are looked for a relation with derivative of output function. When the relation is provided, feedback control function is generated to control pendulum in up equilibrium point. Third, stability analysis is exposed with Lyapunov function and LaSalle’s invariant stability analysis. They are given to determine system stability. Finally, schedule of thesis is found. In second section, manufacturing and design of pendulum are discussed. Pendulum design is done using CATIA, which is three dimentional solid modelling and analysis software program. First idea of pendulum design, is to have materials as far as light and durable such as delrin and aluminum. Therefore, delrin is used for wheel and pendulum arm. Alimunium is used for stable parts of pendulum. However, shafts are manufactured with steel. What’s more, detailed information about pendulum’s parts are also included in this section. To determine whether the pendulum parts can be manufactured or not, strength analyses is investigated using CATIA. Strength analysis forces are defined from simple dynamic model of pendulum which includes point charge and negligible rope. Point charge include all mass of the pendulum and rope lenght is the same as center of mass. Then, magnitudes of forces are derived with Newton equations. Pursuant to these forces, strength analyses are done with CATIA. Position graph is shown using pendulum’s dynamic equations. Related to the position graph, it is proved that the designed pendulum swings 2 times which is desired for this study to reach its up equilibrium point. These two approaches are demonstrated that needed pendulum can be manufactured. At the end of this chapter full product is presented. In third section, dynamic models is derived for ideal environment with Euler-Lagrange method. Furthermore, some advices are given about how to add frictions to the pendulum’s dynamic model using MATLAB-Simulink. Euler-Lagrange method is useful to derive dynamic equations of a system. It depends on kinetic and potential energy of entire system. In order to define kinetic energy of pendulum, moment of inertia, is necessary to be found out. After finding moment of inertia and energies, Lagrange function is able to be determined. Thanks to Lagrange function, Euler-Lagrange equation can be finally solved. The solution of Euler-Lagrange equation gives dynamic model of the pendulum. Whereby the solution of the equation, dynamic model is found. According to dynamic model, simulation is performed by using MATLAB-Simulink. As a result of this simulation, positions and angular velocities can be determined for wheel and pendulum arm. In {{spite of the fact that}} dynamic equations are determined for ideal environment, in practice, friction forces have effects over the pendulum. Therefore, some advices are given how to determine those friction forces. For example, if pendulum arm is free fell from 90 degrees, then its motion can be monitored via encoder. The plot of motion can be compared to Simulink Coulomb and Viscous friction block’s result, which is added to pendulum’s dynamic model. With respect to this comparison, Coulomb and Viscous friction block’s gains are able to be determined. Similarly, wheel frictions gains can be found, as well. Wheel can be driven until its maximum limit, after given energy is stopped and wheel can be allowed to free rotation. Then, plot of free rotation can be compared to dynamic model with Coulomb and Viscous friction block. In conclusion, block gains are provided. In fourth section, three different control methods and their hybrid control are mentioned. First of all, their aims are discussed. Two of three different control methods are to swing up pendulum from down to up right (unstable equlibrium) point. The other one is to balance pendulum in up right possition. Swing up control methods can not be used to control the pendulum in up righ possiton. Therefore, third control method which is known as input-output feedback linearization (feedback linearization) method is used. Before using feedback linearization, controllability of pendulum is shown via state-space model. To use state-space model, dynamic model is linearized using Taylor series. Feedback linearization method’s fundamental is to determine a suitable output function. Using derivative of selected output function, a relation can be supplied with input function. When the relation is obvious, then new control signal can be created which is used to control pendulum. Second, the pendulum requires Lyapunov function method to be swinged. This method is called as “energy based swing up control method” because system’s total energy is used in Lyapunov function. An appropriate Lyapunov function is selected as related to total energy of the pendulum. According to Lyapunov function, a control signal is selected to swing up the pendulum until up righ point. In addition, passivity of pendulum is explained to be able to use Lyapunov function. Third, the main control method for this study is given to swing up the pendulum. This method depends on switching the motor power. Pendulum is started with initial conditions with a maximum torque, it reaches to a maximum point and stops due to loss of energy. Then, the motor is switched to transfer more energy to the system. Hence, pendulum reaches higher point at the end of the first period. This switching continues until reaching up right position zone. The important idea is to stop transfered energy, when the motor is stopped, at right moment. Because of this, end swing angle and cut <b>off</b> <b>torque</b> angle are found. After determining control inputs of swing up and balance, their hybrid controls are created. Finally, these hybrid controls are compared. Fifth section is designed as future work. Cooperating reaction wheel pendulums are included in future work. Begining of the section, cooperating reaction wheel pendulums’ manufacture are exhibited. In product, there are two identical reaction wheel pendulum and their junction is supplied with elastic load. Afterwards, its dynamic model is derived using Newton-Euler approach which gives the same result as Euler-Lagrange with different way. This method is a suitable way for manipulator and it depends on force and torque balance of each link. Therefore, cooperating reaction wheel pendulums are modeled as a manipulator system. Then, its kinematic model is derived for each part. Related to this kinematic model, dynamic model is presented for ideal environment. Its simulation is performed by using the found dynamic model in MATLAB-Simulink and its result is shown and analysed. After, control scenarios of cooperating system are explained. In final section, general results of thesis are declareted and some control methods such as feedback linearization are compared to literature investigations. In addtion to this, general summary about the thesis is given. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
