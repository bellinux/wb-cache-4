5|$|In October 2010, it {{was found}} that GK Films plans to produce a horror film {{inspired}} by the song, directed by Kenny Ortega and produced with Ivan Reitman. As of February 2016, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> further news.|$|E
5|$|Unlike First Nations {{people and}} Inuit, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> {{distinction}} between status and non-status, and the Métis, their heritage and Aboriginal ancestry {{have often been}} absorbed and assimilated into their surrounding populations.|$|E
5|$|Writing in the 4th century, the Pilgrim of Bordeaux {{reported}} that the sepulchers of David, Ezekiel, Asaph, Job, Jesse, and Solomon were located near Bethlehem. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> corroboration of this.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} first teased {{at a press}} conference in June 2010, {{as well as at the}} Tokyo Game Show in September 2010, before its formal reveal at the Level-5 Vision conference in October 2010. The first chapter, titled , was {{released}} in December 2010. Since its release, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> news regarding the development or release of subsequent chapters.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> new {{material}} since 2001, but reprints {{of the strip}} have appeared online and in print. The Roy of the Rovers website has archived all of the Match of the Day years' material, in addition to excerpts from other classic strips. In October 2007, Setanta bought the original strips, which they featured on their web site.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> {{scientific}} {{proof of}} any cause. However, diffusion weighted MRI studies taken from 12–24 hours following an episode has shown {{there to be}} small dot-like lesions in the hippocampus. These findings have suggested a possible implication of CA1 neurons made vulnerable by metabolic stress.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{immigrants}} were from China. Several hundred Chinese arrived in California in 1849 and 1850, and in 1852 more than 20,000 landed in San Francisco. Their distinctive dress and appearance was highly recognizable in the goldfields. Chinese miners suffered enormously, enduring violent racism from white miners who aimed their frustrations at foreigners. To this day, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> justice for known victims. Further animosity toward the Chinese led to legislation {{such as the}} Chinese Exclusion Act and Foreign Miners Tax.|$|E
5|$|Chinese, Indian and Comorian {{minorities}} {{are present in}} Madagascar, {{as well as a}} small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the exodus of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga. By comparison, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> significant emigration of Malagasy peoples. The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958 to 17,000 three decades later. There were an estimated 25,000Comorans, 18,000Indians, and 9,000Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{animals are}} also found, {{in common with}} much of Adelaide. While red foxes, cats, European rabbits, black rats, house mice and European hares are seen, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> {{systemic}} recording of alien fauna species. Exotic birds, including rock pigeons, European goldfinch, house sparrow, starlings and blackbirds are common. Introduced bees and European wasps are present, with the aggressive wasps an issue for the park's visitors.|$|E

5|$|In the Aleutian Islands, {{a massive}} and {{unexpected}} disappearance of sea otters {{has occurred in}} recent decades. In the 1980s, the area was home to an estimated 55,000 to 100,000 sea otters, but the population fell to around 6,000 animals by 2000. The most widely accepted, but still controversial, hypothesis is that killer whales have been eating the otters. The pattern of disappearances {{is consistent with a}} rise in predation, but <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> direct evidence of orcas preying on sea otters to any significant extent.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{political}} affiliation in the Senate {{in the most}} recent era is distinct in several key respects from what has been the case historically. Since November 4, 2015, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> government caucus in the Senate because the Senate Liberal Caucus is not affiliated with the governing Liberal Party of Canada. On December 6, 2016, {{for the first time in}} Canadian history the number of senators without a partisan affiliation exceeded that of the largest caucus of senators with a partisan affiliation.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> serious {{accident}} in the immediate area around Victoria station. On 26 February 1884, an explosion occurred in the cloak-room of the Brighton side injuring seven staff, {{as part of the}} Fenian dynamite campaign. On 27 August 1910, an empty LB stock train derailed due to inadequate signalling arrangements, leading to four injuries. On 17 July 1946, a light engine collided with a passenger train; several people were injured. On 15 December 1959, a passenger train collided with a rake of parcels vans. At least eleven people were injured.|$|E

5|$|After {{missions}} {{discovered the}} reality of the harsh nature of the planet's surface, attention shifted towards other targets such as Mars. There {{have been a number of}} proposed missions afterwards however, and many of these involve the little-known upper atmosphere. The Soviet Vega program in 1985 dropped two balloons into the atmosphere, but these were battery-powered and lasted for only about two Earth days each before running out of power. Since then, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> exploration of the upper atmosphere. In 2002, the NASA contractor Global Aerospace proposed a balloon that would be capable of staying in the upper atmosphere for hundreds of Earth days as opposed to two.|$|E
5|$|Being {{a pilgrimage}} town, the {{majority}} of the population is involved in tourism related industry consisting of trade and services. Service sector increased from 70% in 1971 to 98.78% in 2001, while the agricultural sector reduced from 23% in 1971 to 0.13% in 2001. Rameswaram is an industrially backward town – <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> demarcation for industrial land due to the pilgrim sanctity and ecological fragile geography. Being an island town, the traditional occupation was fishing, but due to poor returns, the people in fishing community have gradually shifted to other professions. Banks such as State Bank of India, Indian Bank and RDCC Bank have their branches in Rameswaram.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in modern}} democracies, Freemasonry is {{sometimes}} viewed with distrust. In the UK, Masons {{working in the}} justice system, such as judges and police officers, were from 1999 to 2009 required to disclose their membership. While a parliamentary inquiry found that <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> evidence of wrongdoing, {{it was felt that}} any potential loyalties Masons might have, based on their vows to support fellow Masons, should be transparent to the public. The policy of requiring a declaration of masonic membership of applicants for judicial office (judges and magistrates) was ended in 2009 by Justice Secretary Jack Straw (who had initiated the requirement in the 1990s). Straw stated that the rule was considered disproportionate, since no impropriety or malpractice had been shown as a result of judges being Freemasons.|$|E

5|$|Events with a {{duration}} of less than about two seconds are classified as short gamma-ray bursts. These account for about 30% of gamma-ray bursts, but until 2005, no afterglow had been successfully detected from any short event and little was known about their origins. Since then, several dozen short gamma-ray burst afterglows have been detected and localized, several of which are associated with regions of little or no star formation, such as large elliptical galaxies and the central regions of large galaxy clusters. This rules out a link to massive stars, confirming that short events are physically distinct from long events. In addition, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> association with supernovae.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, 2005, {{a report}} on Anime News Network {{mentioned}} a possible live-action Last Exile film. It {{was based on a}} blog post by Patrick Macias, writer for Animerica and {{author of several books on}} Japanese pop culture and anime, which noted that while he was attending the Tokyo International Anime Fair, a Gonzo employee suggested that an unnamed New Line Cinema producer was interested in adapting the series for a live-action production. On July 8, 2009, a concept art image was leaked on the Internet but was removed at the request of filmmakers. However, as of 2013, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> new news about the Live-action film, suggesting it has been canceled.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1960s, {{populations of}} the Caucasian jungle cat living along the Caspian Sea and in the Caucasus range states have been rapidly declining. Only small populations persist today. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> record in the Astrakhan Nature Reserve in the Volga Delta since the 1980s. The jungle cat is rare in the Middle East. In Jordan, it is highly {{affected}} by the expansion of agricultural areas around the river beds of Yarmouk and Jordan rivers, where farmers hunted and poisoned jungle cats for attacking poultry. It is also considered rare and threatened in Afghanistan. India exported jungle cat skins in large numbers, until this was banned in 1979; some illegal trade, however, continues in the country, {{as well as in}} Egypt and Afghanistan.|$|E
