5|$|Operation Dragoon was {{controversial}} {{from the}} time it was first proposed. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>military</b> leadership and its British counterparts disagreed on the operation. Winston Churchill argued against it {{on the grounds that it}} diverted military resources that were better deployed for Allied operations in Italy; instead, he favored an invasion of the oil-producing regions of the Balkans. Churchill reasoned that by attacking the Balkans, the Western Allies could deny Germany petroleum, forestall the advance of the Red Army of the Soviet Union, and achieve a superior negotiating position in post-war Europe, all at a stroke.|$|E
5|$|Rolling Thunder {{had begun}} as a {{campaign}} of psychological and strategic persuasion, but it changed very quickly to interdiction, a tactical mission. Its ultimate failure had two sources, both of which lay with the civilian and military policy-makers in Washington: first, neither group could ever conceive that the North Vietnamese would endure under the punishment that they would unleash upon it. The civilians, moreover, did not understand air power {{well enough to know}} that their policies might be crippling it; second, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>military</b> leadership failed to initially propose and develop, or later to adapt, an appropriate strategy for the war.|$|E

5|$|The {{onset of}} World War II caused a massive {{upheaval}} in people's lives as military mobilization engaged millions of men.

Unlike processes to screen out male homosexuals, which had been in place since the creation of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>military,</b> there were no methods to identify or screen for lesbians; they were put into place gradually during World War II.

5|$|Although some {{of these}} {{restrictions}} were later loosened or rescinded, Johnson (with McNamara's support) kept a tight rein on the campaign, which continuously infuriated <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>military</b> commanders, right-wing members of Congress, and even some within the administration itself. One of the primary objectives of the operation, {{at least to the}} military, should have been the closure of Haiphong and other ports by aerial mining, thereby slowing or halting the flow of seaborne supplies entering the north. President Johnson refused to take such a provocative action, however, and such an operation was not implemented until 1972. There was also little consultation between Johnson and the military chiefs during the target selection process. Even the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Earl G. Wheeler, was not present for most of the critical discussions of 1965 and participated only occasionally thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{brothers}} received initial {{support from the}} government, the Soviet Union officially protested the airport on 5 November 1958. They claimed {{it could be used}} as an air force base—and thus would be a violation of the Svalbard Treaty—and pointed out that planning was partially financed with American military funding and that Gunnar was a military officer. From then on the Norwegian government started actively opposing the airport. At first they asked the company to cease operations, then asked <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>military</b> to cut funding. They also instructed all government-owned companies to not allow an airport to be built on their ground. The government also used Gunnar's military rank to hinder him, to limited extent, from pursuing the plans. The Aviation Act, which required all airports to have a concession to operate, came into effect from 1961, effectively stopping the plans.|$|E

5|$|Barrel Roll {{was one of}} {{the most}} closely held secrets and one of the most unknown {{components}} of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>military</b> commitment in Southeast Asia. Due to the ostensible neutrality of Laos, guaranteed by the Geneva Conference of 1954 and 1962, both the U.S. and North Vietnam strove to maintain the secrecy of their operations and only slowly escalated military actions there. As much as both parties would have liked to have publicized their enemy's own alleged violation of the accords, both had more to gain by keeping their own roles quiet. Regardless, by the end of the conflict in 1975, Laos emerged from nine years of war just as devastated as any of the other Asian participants in the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 {{a section}} of the LNC's land at Brookwood was set aside as Brookwood American Cemetery and Memorial, the sole burial ground in Britain for US {{military}} casualties of the First World War. As most US casualties had occurred in continental Europe and been buried there the number interred at Brookwood was small, with a total of 468 servicemen buried in the cemetery. After the entry of the United States into the Second World War the American cemetery was enlarged, with burials of US servicemen beginning in April 1942. With large numbers of American personnel based in the west of England, a dedicated rail service for the transport of bodies operated from Devonport to Brookwood. By August 1944 over 3,600 bodies had been buried in <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Military</b> Cemetery.
