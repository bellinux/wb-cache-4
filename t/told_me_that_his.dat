500|$|Faced with a {{mortgage}} and a $2,000-per-month alimony obligation {{as a result}} of his 1969 divorce, he began to support himself largely by giving college lectures and appearances at science fiction conventions. [...] According to Arthur C. Clarke, [...] "After attending , Gene introduced himself and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> series was being cancelled because the television executives, in their inscrutable wisdom, had decided that there was no audience for it. Poor Gene was broke and about to mortgage his home. I introduced him to my lecture agent, who was skeptical but booked him into a small hall -- which couldn't hold the audience he attracted." [...] Although the geographical distance imposed by Clarke's residence in Sri Lanka resulted in only a handful of physical meetings, Roddenberry would later characterize their friendship as [...] "the most significant of my professional life.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Graham {{always told}} me right early on {{that he would never}} get married. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> life was devastated when his parents split up, and he said {{straight}} out, [...] "Mrs Fox, I'll never get married", so I never expected anything more of him than what did happen. Even when Lana Cantrell came into the scene I was puzzled and I did say to him why all this, and of course we all know it was good publicity. Lana came to the house and I had to go up, and have it all cleaned, ready for her and her party to come one Sunday night. And then on the Monday night, this great big announcement was going to be made that {{he was supposed to be}} engaged to Lana Cantrell. Well, the ratings went through the roof...|$|E
2500|$|Salman Ahmed {{while talking}} about his latest project at Asia Talk on BBC said, [...] "For almost a decade, Junaid has always asked me not to bring guitar or {{to ask him to}} sing. When you are friends with {{somebody}} you always have to transcend differences and I respect Junaid's views. Junaid once <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> biggest regret was not {{to be a part of}} Jazba Junoon's recording. So when we came up with 'Naya Pakistan', I asked him that this is the chance that's not going to come again so finally Junaid accepted the offer with the condition that he will sing only the opening lines with no music at all." [...] and further added [...] "it signifies the metaphor for unity as we have to compromise for unity in hope of Naya Pakistan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He didn't {{seem to like}} it at fust, {{and said}} 'e would write 'imself, but arter I 'ad pointed out that 'e might forget and that I was responsible, 'e gave way and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>'is</b> father was named Mr. Watson, and he kept a big draper's shop in the Commercial Road.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] exclaimed the Dey in surprise, [...] "Lucien never <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> {{although}} <b>his</b> {{own hand}} made out the order for their execution!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A {{very sad}} tale, senora, but {{one which is}} not finished. While he lay dying, my friend <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> in <b>his</b> early life he had plighted troth with a certain English maid, named--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Torrington says so. I asked {{particularly}} who he was, and she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> {{mother was}} some foreigner of high rank." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mashune {{was still}} living, {{but a single}} glance at him <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> hour had come. The buffalo's horn had driven a great hole in his right lung, and inflicted other injuries.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had only}} {{performed}} one operation, which {{was essentially a}} minor one. Abu <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> wife, of whom he was very fond, was suffering very great pain from a tooth--could I cure her? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because when I {{was small}} I was round and soft," [...] replied the girl, {{with a slight}} smile, [...] "like the little animal of <b>that</b> name. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> in <b>his</b> own {{language}} the animal is called rubbit." ...|$|R
60|$|They are {{wonderful}} English scholars, these people; my lecture audience--all Hungarians--understood me perfectly--to {{judge by the}} effects. The English clergyman <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> in <b>his</b> congregation are 150 young English women who earn their living teaching their language; {{and that there are}} others besides these.|$|R
60|$|Another Day {{talking of}} the Place, it {{naturally}} led {{us into a}} Discourse of the Knight of la Mancha, Don Quixot. At which time he <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> in <b>his</b> Opinion, <b>that</b> Work was a perfect Paradox, being {{the best and the}} worst Romance, that ever was wrote.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Lothair, [...] "I {{have been}} abroad and am very {{deficient}} in these matters. But I was travelling with the lady's brother, {{and he has}} never yet <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> sister {{was going to be}} married." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I went, {{and after}} a time I came across the very man who is here now, this Robert Lefroy. I met him and {{questioned}} him, and he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> brother had been killed while fighting. It was a lie." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{he further}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> mother had brought {{home with her}} a Mrs. Sandford with a daughter, heiress to L60,000, and to a newly-bought estate in Surrey, and newly-built house [...] "of the most {{desirable}} description," [...] he added, shrugging his shoulders.|$|E
6000|$|... "But tell {{me about}} his money, Bob," [...] said his sister. [...] "He has not <b>told</b> <b>me</b> yet, and I am so curious. How did he make it? It was not from <b>his</b> father; he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> himself. <b>His</b> father was just a country doctor. How did he do it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He has courage," [...] Wilmore declared. [...] "He {{has also}} a very {{beautiful}} companion. Were you serious, Francis, when you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was <b>his</b> wife?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> none of <b>his</b> {{people were}} with him--that he was alone. There is {{therefore}} no occasion {{for the young}} men to look fierce or go on the war-path." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Since England and France are not {{at present}} on ill terms," [...] the king said, [...] "he may well {{discharge}} both duties without treason to either Henry or myself; but they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> vassalage to me has sat but lightly upon him." ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} very strange in all this. It was not Holmes's nature to take an aimless holiday, and something about his pale, worn face <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> nerves were at their highest tension. He saw the question in my eyes, and, putting his finger-tips together and his elbows upon his knees, he explained the situation.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{sending a}} man down with this {{to hand it}} to the guard as the up coach goes through the town. Chetwynd <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> call on me was the first he had paid, so I feel fairly {{confident}} that I shall forestall the rest of your friends, and that you will give me the pleasure of your company." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "However, I {{have one}} {{good reason for}} being obliged to him, since it was through him that I {{obtained}} my commission. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> in <b>his</b> young days, {{he had been at}} a French college with the duke. They had been great friends there, and he thought that, in memory of this, de Noailles would procure me a commission." ...|$|R
60|$|We were separated, a {{few days}} afterward, by the {{distressing}} news which reached me {{of the state of}} my brother's health. I went at once to his house in the country. His medical attendants had lost all hope of saving him: they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> plainly <b>that</b> <b>his</b> release from a life of suffering was near at hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Redlaw is much altered, and has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{this morning}} <b>that</b> <b>his</b> memory is impaired. Be very {{considerate}} to him, Mr. Edmund; he needs that from us all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{first day}} I came I saw {{a young man}} sitting {{opposite}} me at the table, smiling {{at me as if}} he had known me from my cradle. I knew, for Uncle Mark had <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> name was Jonas Blake, that he was a Theological Student from St. Columbia, and that he had taken charge of the Point Prospect Mission Church for the summer.|$|E
6000|$|Lord Erymanth had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> {{sister would}} soon be at home, and in September I was {{surprised}} by a call from Dermot. [...] "Yes, I'm at Arked," [...] he said, [...] "Killy Marey is full of Dublin workmen. My uncle has undertaken to make it habitable for me, like an old brick, and, in the meantime, there's not a room fit to smoke or sleep in, so I'm come home like a dutiful son." ...|$|E
6000|$|The son {{paused a}} moment before he {{answered}} his mother, thinking over all {{the circumstances of his}} position. [...] "I cannot do so as long as I am subject to my father's threat," [...] he said at last. [...] "What took place between my father and Miss Crawley can go for nothing with me. He has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> allowance to me is to be withdrawn. Let him tell me that he has reconsidered the matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{less than}} an hour, we saw the trees that marked the {{position}} of the well; and, in another half hour, reached it. At least a score of wounded men were there, many of them so sorely hurt that they would get no farther. They paid little attention to us. One of them was known to Saleh--for the wounded man <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was <b>his</b> name--he also was from El Obeid. He was suffering from a terrible cut in the shoulder, which had almost severed the arm. He told my man that it was given by one of the infidel officers, before he fell.|$|R
6000|$|My {{father has}} often <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he revises <b>his</b> {{writings}} on religious subjects. I may harmlessly imitate that good example, by revising my restored entry. It {{is now a}} sufficiently remarkable performance to be distinguished by a title. Let me call it: ...|$|R
5000|$|Nawaf {{was born}} in Mecca in Saudi Arabia to Muhammad Salim al-Hazmi, a grocer. He {{traveled}} to Afghanistan {{as a teenager in}} 1993. CNN's preliminary report following the attacks claimed that an unnamed acquaintance relayed [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> once <b>that</b> <b>his</b> father had tried to kill him when he was a child. He never <b>told</b> <b>me</b> why, but he had a long knife scar on his forearm", and claimed <b>that</b> <b>his</b> older brother was a police chief in Jizan.|$|R
60|$|He sat {{opposite}} to me, {{and lit a}} cigarette in his old, nonchalant manner. He was dressed in the seedy frockcoat of the book merchant, but the rest of that individual lay in a pile of white hair and old books upon the table. Holmes looked even thinner and keener than of old, but there was a dead-white tinge in his aquiline face which <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> life recently had not been a healthy one.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is more proper-looking, and better suited, too, for the world's work, when it goes about {{with some sort of}} a garment on it. We are so used to a leaven of {{falsehood}} in all we hear and say, nowadays, that nothing is more likely to deceive us than the absolute truth. If a shopkeeper <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> wares were simply middling, of course, I should think that they were not worth a farthing. But all {{that has nothing to do}} with my poor brother. Well, what was I saying?" ...|$|E
60|$|This {{changed the}} subject in an instant, and made us hurriedly resolve {{to go to the}} play. So, when I had pledged myself to comfort and abet Herbert in the affair of his heart by all {{practicable}} and impracticable means, and when Herbert had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> affianced already knew me by reputation and that I should be presented to her, and when we had warmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence, we blew out our candles, made up our fire, locked our door, and issued forth in quest of Mr. Wopsle and Denmark.|$|E
25|$|I {{went to see}} Professor Douglas Hartree, who {{had built}} the first {{differential}} analyzers in England and had more experience in using these very specialized computers than anyone else. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> in <b>his</b> opinion, all the calculations that would ever be needed in this country could {{be done on the}} three digital computers which were then being built—one in Cambridge, one in Teddington, and one in Manchester. No one else, he said, would ever need machines of their own, or would be able to afford to buy them.|$|R
5000|$|The {{new design}} was {{overwhelmingly}} {{approved by the}} congregation in August 1960. At {{the dedication of the}} new building in December 1962, Kahn talked about the relationship between architecture and religion. Komendant said, [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> in <b>his</b> speech he described the cathedrals, whose size and height was intended to show God's greatness and might and man's lowness, so that men would be frightened and obey His laws. For this church he used atmosphere and beauty to create respect and understanding for God's aims, kindness, and forgiveness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seems {{to me he}} {{must have}} been {{something}} of a crank, too," [...] was Davidson's comment. [...] "Apparently he had quarrelled with his people in Sweden. Just the sort of father you would expect Heyst to have. Isn't he a bit of a crank himself? He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> directly <b>his</b> father died he lit out into the wide world on his own, and had been on the move till he fetched up against this famous coal business. Fits the son of the father somehow, don't you think?" ...|$|R
