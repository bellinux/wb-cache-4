5|$|On 24 April 2002, SAS {{announced}} that all handling services operated by Braathens {{would be taken}} over by SAS Ground Services. All SAS employees would be prioritized in the rationalization process, and 800 Braathens employees were laid off. Three hundred Braathens' employees were offered jobs with SAS Ground Services, but these lost their seniority. No employees in SAS lost their jobs. The case ended in the courts, where 369 former Braathens employees sued SAS to receive the same seniority as they had in Braathens. On 15 October 2003, Asker and Bærum District Court decided that only 42 of <b>the</b> <b>employees,</b> those working in Kristiansund and Molde, had right to keep their seniority. The case was appealed, and on 18 March 2005, Borgarting Court of Appeal, with four against three votes, decided in favor of SAS, denying <b>the</b> <b>employees</b> their claim. The matter was not settled until 31 January 2006, when the Supreme Court of Norway ruled in favor of <b>the</b> <b>employees.</b>|$|E

40|$|We study <b>the</b> <b>employee</b> {{retention}} and job assignment strategy of growth-oriented entrepreneurial firms in which <b>the</b> <b>employee’s</b> capability is unknown {{to both the}} firm and <b>the</b> <b>employee.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>employee</b> performs his task, both the firm and <b>the</b> <b>employee</b> update their common belief about <b>the</b> <b>employee’s</b> capability based on the noisy profit stream from <b>the</b> <b>employee’s</b> performance. <b>The</b> firm seeks to dismiss low-capability employees while high-capability employees seek to leave the firm for higher compensation. We model this situation as a real options game between the firm and <b>the</b> <b>employee,</b> and we obtain a Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE) characterized by the employment termination strategies of the two players. In stark contrast to conventional real options models, {{a higher rate of}} learning can hurt both players when <b>the</b> <b>employee’s</b> capability is sufficiently uncertain. This suggests that firms should assign employees with highly uncertain capabilities to tasks with high noise levels...|$|R
