MethodsFifty women of ASA physical status I or II at term pregnancy were enrolled randomly to receive either plain bupivacaine plus fentanyl (BF group) or plain bupivacaine plus mixture of fentanyl and dexmedetomidine (DBF group). Incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, Apgar scores, intraoperative pain assessment, onset of postoperative pain, sedation scores and side effects were recorded. ResultsNo difference in the times taken for block to reach T 4 sensory level, to reach the highest level of sensory block and interval between first neuraxial injection and onset of surgery between the groups. Onset of postoperative pain was significantly delayed in the DBF group (P= 0. 001), the need for supplementary fentanyl was significantly less in DBF group (P= 0. 03), and no significant difference was obtained between both groups regarding neonatal Apgar scores as well as the incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, nausea, vomiting and duration of motor blockade between the groups. DBF group had significantly less incidence of shivering (P= 0. 03). ConclusionAdding dexmedetomidine <b>to</b> <b>regular</b> <b>mixture</b> of epidural anesthetics in women undergoing elective cesarean section improved intraoperative conditions and quality of postoperative analgesia without maternal or neonatal significant side effects...|$|E
40|$|A {{hierarchical}} clustering algorithm {{based on}} Gaussian mixture model is presented. The key difference <b>to</b> <b>regular</b> hierarchical <b>mixture</b> models {{is the ability}} to store objects in both terminal and nonterminal nodes. Upper levels of the hierarchy contain sparsely distributed objects, while lower levels contain densely represented ones. As it was shown by experiments, this ability helps in noise detection (modelling). Furthermore, compared <b>to</b> <b>regular</b> hierarchical <b>mixture</b> model, the presented method generates more compact dendrograms with higher quality measured by adopted F-measure.

50|$|Disadvantages: Compared <b>to</b> <b>regular</b> dense <b>mixtures,</b> {{performance}} design mixtures can be {{more difficult}} to compact. Failing to achieve proper in-place density can cause potential permeability problems and shorten the performance life of the pavement. In some cases, performance design mixtures can be “too dry” in terms of asphalt content. This can result in a mixture that is susceptible to cracking.|$|R
40|$|A hybrid state {{detection}} {{algorithm is}} presented for {{the estimation of}} baseline and movement states {{which can be used}} to trigger a free paced neuroprostethic. The hybrid model was constructed by fusing a multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), where the internal hidden state observation probabilities were represented by the discriminative output of the SVM. The proposed method was applied to the multichannel Electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings of BCI competition IV to identify the baseline and movement states while subjects were executing individual finger movements. The results are compared <b>to</b> <b>regular</b> Gaussian <b>Mixture</b> Model (GMM) -based HMM with the same number of states as SVM-based HMM structure. Our results indicate that the proposed hybrid state estimation method out-performs the standard HMM-based solution in all subjects studied with higher latency. The average latency of the hybrid decoder was approximately 290 ms. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{functional}} mixture model for simultaneous clustering and alignment of sets of curves {{measured on a}} discrete time grid. The model is specifically tailored to gene expression time course data. Each functional cluster center is a nonlinear combination of solutions of a simple linear differential equation that describes the change of individual mRNA levels when the synthesis and decay rates are constant. The mixture of continuous time parametric functional forms allows one to (a) account for the heterogeneity in the observed profiles, (b) align the profiles in time by estimating real-valued time shifts, (c) capture the synthesis and decay of mRNA {{in the course of}} an experiment, and (d) regularize noisy profiles by enforcing smoothness in the mean curves. We derive an EM algorithm for estimating the parameters of the model, and apply the proposed approach to the set of cycling genes in yeast. The experiments show consistent improvement in predictive power and within cluster variance compared <b>to</b> <b>regular</b> Gaussian <b>mixtures.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Group dynamic {{movement}} {{is a fundamental}} aspect of many species' movements. The need to adequately model individuals' interactions with other group members has been recognised, particularly in order to differentiate the role of social forces in individual movement from environmental factors. However, to date, practical statistical methods which can include group dynamics in animal movement models have been lacking. We consider a flexible modelling framework that distinguishes a group-level model, describing {{the movement of the}} group's centre, and an individual-level model, such that each individual makes its movement decisions relative to the group centroid. The basic idea is framed within the flexible class of hidden Markov models, extending previous work on modelling animal movement by means of multi-state random walks. While in simulation experiments parameter estimators exhibit some bias in non-ideal scenarios, we show that generally the estimation of models of this type is both feasible and ecologically informative. We illustrate the approach using real movement data from 11 reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). Results indicate a directional bias towards a group centroid for reindeer in an encamped state. Though the attraction to the group centroid is relatively weak, our model successfully captures group-influenced movement dynamics. Specifically, as compared <b>to</b> a <b>regular</b> <b>mixture</b> of correlated random walks, the group dynamic model more accurately predicts the non-diffusive behaviour of a cohesive mobile group...|$|R
40|$|Exchange qui l ibr ia {{between a}} cation {{exchange}} membrane and an aqueous olution were studied experimental ly and theoretically. By using thermodynamic components {{in terms of}} the Gibbs phase rule, and a suitable reference state, a convenient method for data treatment was obtained. Thermodynamic mixture p operties were derived for one membrane with four pairs of monovalent cations. The results show that when the difference in cation size is small, the cation exchange membrane behaves nearly ideal. For larger differences, the membrane may be described as a <b>regular</b> <b>mixture.</b> Activity coefficients for membrane mixtures can be obtained easily for <b>regular</b> <b>mixtures.</b> The theory of <b>regular</b> <b>mixtures</b> 1 - 3 has proven useful for treating mixtures of molten salts. Molten salts can be de-scribed as consisting of a cation lattice interlocking with an anion lattice with no interchange between the two, the Temkin model. 4 For mixtures where the energy of interac-tion between salt components i small, the configurational entropy of the mixture can be calculated {{on the basis of a}} random distr ibution of the cations over all cation positions...|$|R

These two facts have guided researchers toward capturing AV relation using different models and adopt it for AVSS tasks.|$|R
