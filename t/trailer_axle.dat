40|$|The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, in {{coordination}} with the Federal Highway Administration, sponsored the Heavy and Overweight Vehicle Brake Testing (HOVBT) program {{in order to provide}} information about the effect of gross vehicle weight (GVW) on braking performance. Because the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations limit the number of braking system defects that may exist for a vehicle to be allowed to operate on the roadways, the examination of the effect of brake defects on brake performance for increased loads is also relevant. The HOVBT program seeks to provide relevant information to policy makers responsible for establishing load limits, beginning with providing test data for a combination tractor/trailer. This testing was conducted on a five-axle combination vehicle with tractor brakes meeting the Reduced Stopping Distance requirement rulemaking. This report provides a summary of the testing activities, the results of various analyses of the data, and recommendations for future research. Following a complete brake rebuild, instrumentation, and brake burnish, stopping tests were performed from 20 and 40 mph with various brake application pressures (15 psi, 25 psi, 35 psi, 45 psi, 55 psi, and full system pressure). These tests were conducted for various brake conditions at the following GVWs: 60, 000, 80, 000, 91, 000, 97, 000, 106, 000, and 116, 000 lb. The 80, 000 -lb GVWs included both balanced and unbalanced loads. The condition of the braking system was also varied. To introduce these defects, brakes (none, forward drive axle, or rear <b>trailer</b> <b>axle)</b> were made inoperative. In addition to the stopping tests, performance-based brake tests were conducted for the various loading and brake conditions. Analysis of the stopping test data showed the stopping distance to increase with load (as expected) and also showed that more braking force was generated by the drive axle brakes than the <b>trailer</b> <b>axle</b> brakes. The constant-pressure stopping test data revealed a linear relationship between brake application pressure and was used to develop an algorithm to normalize stopping data for weight and initial speed...|$|E

30|$|Among the {{alternative}} methods, there exists an indirect detection and estimation {{process of the}} slip/slide conditions by measuring the voltage, current and speed of {{the alternative}} current (AC) traction motor through an extended Kalman filter (EKF) [7]. Another method is to control the slip/slide states by evaluating the wheel speed information of different axles together. If one of the axles in slip/slide state turns faster or slower than the others, the slipping or sliding axle can be detected and controlled unless all of the axles slip or slide at the same time. A <b>trailer</b> <b>axle</b> solves this kind of problem as well [8]. When a wheelset is accelerated higher than the pre-defined threshold, the reference torque of this wheelset will be decreased distinctly till the adhesion situation is recovered to the micro-slip region. This axle is assumed as a reference axle, and the adhesion forces on the other axles {{are expected to be}} maximized considering its wheel speed information.|$|E
40|$|Previous work on car-trailer {{stability}} {{has been}} largely limited to theoretical studies with some reference to practical experience or accident statistics. In this study, extensive and systematic experimental investigations were carried out oil a combined car-adjustable-trailer system. The influence of different trailer parameters on the system high-speed stability was examined by changing the mass, dimensions, and inertial characteristics of a fully adjustable trailer. It {{was found that the}} dominant factors affecting stability were the trailer yaw inertia, nose mass (mass distribution), and <b>trailer</b> <b>axle</b> position. The tyre pressure also affects the stability, although this effect is less significant. It is interesting to see that the trailer mass alone does not dramatically affect the high-speed stability, as this runs contrary to current guidelines relating to limits on the relative mass of the car and trailer. Experimental tests on a friction stabilizer and on car electronic stability programs demonstrate that both of these improve the high-speed stability and help to delay the onset of 'snaking'...|$|E

5000|$|A weight-distributing hitch is a [...] "load leveling" [...] hitch. It is a hitch setup {{mounted on}} the tow vehicle that uses spring bars and chains under tension to {{distribute}} part of the trailer's hitch weight from the towing vehicle's rear axle to the towing vehicle's front axle and to the <b>trailer's</b> <b>axle(s).</b> It can help reduce trailer sway and hop. Trailer hop can jerk the tow vehicle. Trailer sway is sometimes called [...] "fish tailing". At high speeds, trailer sway can become dangerous. Most vehicle manufacturers will only allow a maximum trailer capacity of 5000 lb and 500 lb of tongue weight without using a weight-distributing hitch.

The quest to increase payload capacities spawned the tri-axle chassis with the ability to scale 42000 lb. on the <b>trailer</b> <b>axles.</b> The addition of the third axle however added a significant increase to the tare weight of the chassis, thus limiting the permissible weight limits to comply with bridge laws. This led to the invention of the Spread Axle Chassis with a spread of 109 in allowing for the same weight to be dispersed on the rear <b>axles</b> of the <b>trailer</b> (42000 lb) as the tri-axle.

40|$|A {{high-speed}} optimal trailer steering controller for a tractor–semitrailer is discussed. A {{linear model}} of a tractor–semitrailer with steered <b>trailer</b> <b>axles</b> is described, and an optimal trailer steering controller is introduced. A path-following controller is derived to minimise the path-tracking error in steady-state manoeuvres using active trailer steering. A roll stability controller is introduced by adding the lateral acceleration of trailer centre of gravity as another objective in the steering controller, so as to improve roll stability in transient manoeuvres. A strategy to switch between these two control modes is demonstrated. Simulation {{results show that the}} steering controller can ensure good path tracking of articulated vehicles in steady-state manoeuvres and improve roll stability significantly in transient manoeuvres, while maintaining the path-tracking deviation within an acceptable range. Tests with an experimental tractor–semitrailer equipped with a high-bandwidth active steering system validate the controller design and simulation results.

Mobile robots with n trailers have been proved differentially flat under some hypotheses [5].
