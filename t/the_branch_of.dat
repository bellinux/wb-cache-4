5|$|In {{addition}} to being an idea of considerable theoretical interest, M-theory provides a framework for constructing models of real world physics that combine general relativity with the standard model of particle physics. Phenomenology is <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> theoretical physics in which physicists construct realistic models of nature from more abstract theoretical ideas. String phenomenology {{is the part of}} string theory that attempts to construct realistic models of particle physics based on string and M-theory.|$|E

The field of phytopathology, the study of plant diseases, is closely related because many plant pathogens are fungi.|$|E
5|$|Quantum {{gravity is}} <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> physics {{that seeks to}} {{describe}} gravity using the principles of quantum mechanics. Currently, the most popular approach to quantum gravity is string theory, which models elementary particles not as zero-dimensional points but as one-dimensional objects called strings. In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one typically considers theories of quantum gravity derived from string theory or its modern extension, M-theory.|$|E
5|$|Social {{anthropology}} is <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> anthropology {{that studies}} how contemporary living human beings behave in social groups. Practitioners of social anthropology, like sociologists, investigate various facets of social organization. Traditionally, social anthropologists analysed non-industrial and non-Western societies, whereas sociologists focused on industrialized {{societies in the}} Western world. In recent years, however, social anthropology has expanded its focus to modern Western societies, meaning that the two disciplines increasingly converge.|$|E

5|$|Beauty {{in nature}} has {{historically}} been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> philosophy called aesthetics. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless. Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The tradition of representing nature as it is {{became one of the}} aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art.|$|E

In enumerative geometry, one is interested in {{counting the number of}} solutions to geometric questions, typically using the techniques of algebraic geometry. One of the earliest problems of enumerative geometry was posed around the year 200 BCE by the ancient Greek mathematician Apollonius, who asked how many circles in the plane are tangent to three given circles. In general, the {{solution to the problem of}} Apollonius is that there are eight such circles.|$|E

Robert Foliot's family {{appears to have been}} <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> the Foliot family that owned the manor of Warpsgrove in Oxfordshire. This is made likely by Foliot's confirmation of a gift of land from Ralph Foliot of Warpsgrove to Ralph's son, and it is possible that Foliot was the brother or uncle of Ralph Foliot.|$|E

After the intersection with East Water Street, State Route 664 crosses the West Branch of the Susquehanna River. The bridge over <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> river {{was constructed in}} 1986. At the intersection with Farrandsville Road, the highway turns eastward, paralleling the river. Nearing State Route 150, the highway turns northward and into Dunnstown. While winding around a few curves, State Route 664 intersects with Armory Drive, an access road to a local armory. The route's surroundings are highly developed in Dunnstown, with the highway passing along homes. At the intersection with Aikey Street, State Route 664 leaves Dunnstown and proceeds northward.|$|E

5|$|The Gun Court is <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> the Jamaican {{judicial}} system that tries criminal cases involving firearms. The Court {{was established by}} Parliament in 1974 to combat rising gun violence, and empowered to try suspects in camera, without a jury. The Supreme Court, Circuit Courts, and Resident Magistrate's Courts function as Gun Courts whenever they hear firearms cases. There is also a Western Regional Gun Court in Montego Bay. Those convicted by the Gun Court are imprisoned in a dedicated prison compound at South Camp in Kingston. Until 1999, the Gun Court sessions were also held in the same facility.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} {{neuroscience}} encompasses all approaches {{that seek to}} understand the brain {{and the rest of}} the nervous system. Psychology seeks to understand mind and behavior, and neurology is the medical discipline that diagnoses and treats diseases of the nervous system. The brain is also the most important organ studied in psychiatry, <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> medicine that works to study, prevent, and treat mental disorders. Cognitive science seeks to unify neuroscience and psychology with other fields that concern themselves with the brain, such as computer science (artificial intelligence and similar fields) and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|The {{headgear}} of {{the typical}} Confederate Infantryman was the slouch hat, or the military Kepi. The Kepi is a short fatigue and dress cap that was easy to manufacture for the Army during the war. This type of hat had its drawbacks, however. It provided little weather protection, and was worn out easily {{after a few months}} of hard wear. The Infantryman design cap was sky-blue with a dark blue band, but this was rarely seen outside of officer private-purchase caps. More typical would be the plain gray/brown cap, with or without <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> service trim. There are examples of deep-south made caps that were trimmed in red cotton and wool, and issued to Infantry units, showing that any available clothing was issued to the troops as the war progressed.|$|E

In Singapore, administrative law is <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> law that enables a person to challenge an exercise of power by {{the executive branch of}} the Government. The challenge is carried out by applying to the High Court for judicial review. The Court's power to review a law or an official act of a government official is part of its supervisory jurisdiction, and at its fullest may involve quashing an action or decision and ordering that it be redone or remade.|$|E
5|$|Viral {{epidemiology}} is <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> {{medical science}} {{that deals with}} the transmission and control of virus infections in humans. Transmission of viruses can be vertical, which means from mother to child, or horizontal, which means from person to person. Examples of vertical transmission include hepatitis B virus and HIV, where the baby is born already infected with the virus. Another, more rare, example is the varicella zoster virus, which, although causing relatively mild infections in humans, can be fatal to the foetus and newborn baby.|$|E
5|$|Diana Hubbard {{was born}} in London, the {{daughter}} of the founder of Dianetics and Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard. She was born Diana Meredith DeWolf Hubbard on September 24, 1952, to L. Ron Hubbard and his wife Mary Sue Hubbard. She was the first child born to Mary Sue and L. Ron Hubbard. She composed sonatas for piano at age 6. She attended the Royal Academy, where she took courses in ballet and music. In her early years as a teenager, she took executive courses in Scientology at Saint Hill Manor along with her brother, Quentin Hubbard. Her other siblings include Suzette and Arthur. At the age of 15, she left the Royal Academy, in order to serve within the Scientology organization and assist her father. During the bulk of her teenage years, she lived most of her life on her father's yacht, located in the Mediterranean. By age 16, she rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander within the elite Scientology group called the Sea Org. She became a spokesperson for <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> the Church of Scientology within the United States in 1969. In 1979, Hubbard lived with her husband audiophile Jonathan Horwich and her daughter Roanne, in Clearwater, Florida. In 1980, she served as an executive within the Church of Scientology, and in 2001 she maintained a leadership position within the organization.|$|E
