5|$|An {{amendment}} to the Articles had been proposed by Thomas Burke, in February 1781, to give Congress <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to collect a 5% impost, or duty on all imports, but this required ratification by all states; securing its passage as law proved impossible after it was rejected by Rhode Island in November 1782. Madison joined Hamilton in persuading Congress to send a delegation to persuade Rhode Island to change its mind. Their report recommending the delegation argued the federal government needed not just some level of financial autonomy, but also {{the ability to make}} laws that superseded those of the individual states. Hamilton transmitted a letter arguing that Congress already had <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to tax, since it had <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to fix the sums due from the several states; but Virginia's rescission of its own ratification ended the Rhode Island negotiations.|$|E

5|$|At 2:44 am EST on March 13, 1989, {{a severe}} {{geomagnetic}} storm, {{due to a}} coronal mass ejection from the Sun, struck Earth. Fluctuations within the magnetic field of the storm caused geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to flow through Quebec's power lines, which are direct current, instead of the alternating current carried by <b>the</b> <b>power</b> lines. The insulating nature of the Canadian Shield igneous rock directed the GICs to <b>the</b> <b>power</b> lines. The conductors then forwarded this current to sensitive electrical transformers, which require a certain voltage amplitude and frequency to function properly. Although most GICs are relatively feeble, the nature of those currents destabilized the voltage of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> grid and current spikes erupted everywhere.|$|E
