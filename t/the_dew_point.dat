5|$|Dew {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. <b>The</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is a saturation point. When <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. <b>The</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> determines the specific humidity of the air. <b>The</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E
5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. <b>The</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{chemical}} reactions have {{water as a}} product. If the reactions take place at temperatures higher than <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> of the surrounding air the water will be formed as vapor and increase the local humidity, if below <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> local condensation will occur. Typical reactions that result in water formation are the burning of hydrogen or hydrocarbons in air or other oxygen containing gas mixtures, or {{as a result of}} reactions with oxidizers.|$|E
50|$|Membrane {{air dryers}} depress <b>the</b> {{incoming}} <b>dew</b> <b>point.</b> Most dryers have a challenge air <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> and pressure specification. So if <b>the</b> inlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> {{is lower than}} the specified challenge air then <b>the</b> outlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is even lower than specified. For example, a dryer could be rated at a −40 °F <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> with a challenge of +70 °F <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> and 100 psig. If the incoming air has an inlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> of only 32 °F, <b>the</b> outlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> will be somewhat less. Pressure also plays a role. If the pressure is higher than the rated specification then <b>the</b> outlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> will be lowered. This lowering of <b>the</b> outlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is due to the longer residence time that the air has inside the membrane. Using the spec above, an operating pressure of 120 psig will yield a lower outlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> than specified. <b>The</b> extent of the improvement is dependent {{on the nature of the}} membrane and could vary among manufacturers.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> {{hydrocarbon}} <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> {{of a gas}} is {{a different}} concept from <b>the</b> water <b>dew</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> latter being the temperature (at a given pressure) at which water vapor present in a gas mixture will condense out of the gas.|$|R
25|$|Water vapor {{will only}} {{condense}} onto another surface when that surface is cooler than <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> temperature, {{or when the}} water vapor equilibrium in air has been exceeded. When water vapor condenses onto a surface, a net warming occurs on that surface. The water molecule brings heat energy with it. In turn, {{the temperature of the}} atmosphere drops slightly. In the atmosphere, condensation produces clouds, fog and precipitation (usually only when facilitated by cloud condensation nuclei). <b>The</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> of an air parcel is the temperature to which it must cool before water vapor in the air begins to condense concluding water vapor is a type of water or rain.|$|E
25|$|Typically, spacers {{are filled}} with or contain {{desiccant}} to remove moisture trapped in the gas space during manufacturing, thereby lowering <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> of the gas in that space, and preventing condensation from forming on surface #2 when the outside glass pane temperature falls.|$|E
25|$|Also, a net {{condensation}} {{of water}} vapor occurs on surfaces {{when the temperature}} of the surface is at or below <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> temperature of the atmosphere. Deposition is a phase transition separate from condensation which leads to the direct formation of ice from water vapor. Frost and snow are examples of deposition.|$|E

50|$|Thus, {{even though}} <b>the</b> local <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> inside <b>the</b> vortex cores is even {{lower than in}} the ambient air, the water vapor may {{nevertheless}} condense — if {{the formation of the}} vortex brings the local temperature below <b>the</b> new local <b>dew</b> <b>point.</b> Let's verify that this can indeed happen under realistic conditions.|$|R
40|$|Both {{analytical}} and the numerical {{methods have been}} developed to compares the energy performance of the OAHU systems and the two-AHU (TAHU) system. The OAHU system saves up to 1. 85 kilojoules heating energy for each kilogram air supplied to the building, or 0. 8 Btu for each pound air supplied to the building when <b>the</b> outside air <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> temperature is less than <b>the</b> room <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> temperature.

25|$|Radiation fog {{is formed}} by the cooling of land after sunset by {{infrared}} thermal radiation in calm conditions with a clear sky. The cooling ground then cools adjacent air by conduction, causing the air temperature to fall below <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point,</b> forming fog. In perfect calm, the fog layer can be less than a meter thick, but turbulence can promote a thicker layer. Radiation fogs occur at night, and usually doesn't last long after sunrise, but it can persist all day in the winter months especially in areas bounded by high ground. Radiation fog is most common in autumn and early winter. Examples of this phenomenon include the Tule fog.|$|E
25|$|Gaseous water {{represents}} {{a small but}} environmentally significant constituent of the atmosphere. The percentage water vapor in surface air varies from 0.01% at -42°C (-44°F) to 4.24% when <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is 30°C (86°F). Approximately 99.13% of it is contained in the troposphere. The condensation of water vapor to the liquid or ice phase is responsible for clouds, rain, snow, and other precipitation, all of which count among the most significant elements of what we experience as weather. Less obviously, the latent heat of vaporization, which is released to the atmosphere whenever condensation occurs, {{is one of the}} most important terms in the atmospheric energy budget on both local and global scales. For example, latent heat release in atmospheric convection is directly responsible for powering destructive storms such as tropical cyclones and severe thunderstorms. Water vapor is the most potent greenhouse gas owing to the presence of the hydroxyl bond which strongly absorbs in the infra-red region of the light spectrum.|$|E
500|$|Active {{atmospheric}} water collectors {{have been in}} use since the commercialisation of mechanical refrigeration. Essentially, all that is required is to cool a heat exchanger below <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point,</b> and water will be produced. Such water production may take place as a by-product, possibly unwanted, of dehumidification. The air conditioning system of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, for example, produces an estimated [...] of water each year that is used for irrigating the tower's landscape plantings.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{hydrocarbon}} <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is <b>the</b> temperature (at a given pressure) {{at which}} the hydrocarbon components of any hydrocarbon-rich gas mixture, such as natural gas, will start to condense out of the gaseous phase. It is often {{also referred to as}} the HDP or the HCDP. The maximum temperature at which such condensation takes place is called the cricondentherm. <b>The</b> hydrocarbon <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> {{is a function of the}} gas composition as well as the pressure.|$|R

500|$|The {{dry line}} is the {{boundary}} between dry and moist air masses east of mountain ranges with similar orientation to the Rockies, depicted {{at the leading edge}} of <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point,</b> or moisture, gradient. Near the surface, warm moist air that is denser than warmer, dryer air wedges under the drier air {{in a manner similar to}} that of a cold front wedging under warmer air. When the warm moist air wedged under the drier mass heats up, it becomes less dense and rises and sometimes forms thunderstorms. [...] At higher altitudes, the warm moist air is less dense than the cooler, drier air and the boundary slope reverses. In the vicinity of the reversal aloft, severe weather is possible, especially when a triple point is formed with a cold front.|$|E
500|$|An air well {{requires}} {{moisture from}} the air. Everywhere on Earth, even in deserts, the surrounding atmosphere contains at least some water. According to Beysens and Milimouk: [...] "The atmosphere contains [...] of fresh water, composed of 98 percent water vapour and 2 percent condensed water (clouds): a figure comparable to the renewable liquid water resources of inhabited lands [...]" [...] The quantity of water vapour contained within the air is commonly reported as a relative humidity, and this depends on temperature—warmer air can contain more water vapour than cooler air. When air is cooled to <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point,</b> it becomes saturated, and moisture will condense on a suitable surface. For instance, the dew temperature of air at [...] and 80 percent relative humidity is [...] The dew temperature falls to [...] if the relative humidity is 50 percent.|$|E

50|$|Dehumidifying Drying - These {{types of}} dryers {{circulate}} hot and de-humidified dry air onto the resin, suck the air back, dry {{it and then}} pump again in a closed loop operation. This process reduces moisture level in the PET down to 50ppm or lower. The efficiency of moisture removal depends on <b>the</b> air <b>dew</b> <b>point.</b> If <b>the</b> air <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is not good, then some moisture remains in the chips and cause IV loss during processing.|$|R

2500|$|The phase {{began with}} three wells {{penetrating}} into the Permian formations of the reservoir. Once produced to surface {{the gas and}} oil were separated before being piped to Orenburg where further processing was undertaken. This was partially due to the sour nature of the gas, with a hydrogen sulphide content of 3.5-5.0% and carbon dioxide content of 5%. Karachaganckgazprom also maintained a policy of full gas voidage replacement to maintain pressure of the reservoir above <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point.</b> By 1990, approximately 200vertical wells had been drilled in Karachaganak reaching a peak production plateau of [...] per day of gas and [...] of oil, before beginning to decline in 1992.|$|E
2500|$|In meteorology, a cloud {{is an aerosol}} {{comprising}} {{a visible}} mass of minute liquid droplets, frozen crystals, or particles suspended in the atmosphere above {{the surface of a}} planetary body. The droplets and crystals may be made of water or various chemicals. [...] On Earth, clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point, or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an adjacent source to raise <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> to the ambient temperature. [...] They are seen in the Earth's homosphere (which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere).

2500|$|In other {{mixtures}} of miscible compounds (components), {{there may be}} two or more components of varying volatility, each having its own pure component boiling point at any given pressure. [...] The presence of other volatile components in a mixture affects the vapor pressures and thus boiling points and dew points of all the components in the mixture. <b>The</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is a temperature at which a vapor condenses into a liquid. [...] Furthermore, at any given temperature, {{the composition of the}} vapor is different from the composition of the liquid in most such cases. [...] In order to illustrate these effects between the volatile components in a mixture, a boiling point diagram is commonly used. [...] Distillation is a process of boiling and [...] condensation which takes advantage of these differences in composition between liquid and vapor phases.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> highest <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> in <b>the</b> US {{are found}} in coastal Florida and Texas. When {{comparing}} Key West and Houston, {{two of the most}} humid cities from those states, coastal Florida seems to have <b>the</b> higher <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> on average. However, Houston lacks the coastal breeze present in Key West, and, as a much larger city, it suffers from the urban heat island effect. [...] A <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> of 88 F was recorded in Moorhead Minnesota on July 19, 2011, with a heat index of 133.5, although <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> over 80 F are rare there.

[...] Appleton, Wisconsin registered a <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> of 90 degrees F on 13 July 1995 with an air temperature of 104 degrees resulting in a heat index of 149 degrees; this record has apparently held and in fact <b>the</b> highest <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> measured in <b>the</b> country bounced amongst or was tied by locations in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa during the preceding 70 years or more with locations in northern Illinois also coming close. <b>Dew</b> <b>points</b> of 95 degrees are found on the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia at certain times.|$|R

50|$|Therefore, {{the case}} {{we have been}} {{considering}} is a marginal case; if the relative humidity of the ambient air were even a bit higher (with the total pressure and temperature remaining as above), then <b>the</b> local <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> inside <b>the</b> vortices would rise, while the local temperature would remain the same as what we have just found. Thus, the local temperature would now be lower than <b>the</b> local <b>dew</b> <b>point,</b> and so <b>the</b> water vapor inside the vortices would indeed condense. Under right conditions, the local temperature in vortex cores may drop below the local freezing point, in which case ice particles will form inside the vortex cores.|$|R
2500|$|There {{is another}} {{possible}} mechanism for rapid methane release. [...] As the Arctic Ocean {{becomes more and}} more ice free, the ocean absorbs more of the incident energy from the sun. The Arctic Ocean becomes warmer than the former ice cover and much more water vapour enters the air. [...] At times when the adjacent land is colder than the sea, this causes rising air above the sea and an off-shore wind as air over the land comes in to replace the rising air over the sea. [...] As the air rises, <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is reached and clouds form, releasing latent heat and further reinforcing the buoyancy of the air over the ocean. [...] All this results in air being drawn from the south across the tundra rather than the present situation of cold air flowing toward the south from the cold sinking air over the Arctic Ocean. [...] The extra heat being drawn from the south further accelerates the warming of the permafrost and the Arctic Ocean with increased release of methane.|$|E
2500|$|At 7 am on March 18, {{the surface}} {{low-pressure}} area at ≈ moved to far northeastern Oklahoma {{and the warm}} front had shot north into the circulation where the front then extended eastward. A maritime Polar (mP) cold front draped southwestward across eastern Texas with a dry line forming due south of the low. The open shortwave, likely somewhat negatively tilted, was continuing to approach from the northwest and an apparent outflow boundary moved {{just south of the}} warm front over northeastern Arkansas and northwestern Tennessee.

This resulted in unstable air and lower cloud bases, or low LCL heights, which is favorable to tornadogenesis. From southeastern Kansas to Kentucky and Indiana, early morning showers and thunderstorms north of the low and warm front cooled and stabilized that air, retarding northward advancement of the front and led to sharp contrast in temperature from north to south. Such baroclinic zones are also associated with tornadic storms. Ahead of the surface dryline, which are not common as far east as the Mississippi River, an apparent [...] "dry punch" [...] of air aloft served to further increase instability. Concurrently, a capping inversion likely suppressed storms throughout the warm sector leaving the Tri-State supercell undisturbed by nearby convection.|$|E
