5|$|A {{game played}} under time control will end as {{a loss for}} a player who uses up all of their allotted time, unless the {{opponent}} cannot possibly checkmate him (see the Timing section above). There are different types of time control. Players may have a fixed amount of time for the entire game or <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make {{a certain number of}} moves within a specified time. Also, a small increment of time may be added for each move made.|$|E

Brian and Stewie appear on the broadcast and bring the dying Santa out in a wheelchair, explaining that humanity's greed is killing him and if they don't shorten their demands to one Christmas present a year, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give up Christmas altogether. Chastened, everyone agrees and by one year later, Santa has recovered, the workshop is once again a lively, colorful cottage and the elves and reindeer are all rejuvenated.|$|E
5|$|Since {{laws of war}} demand {{ambulances}} {{be marked}} {{with one of the}} Emblems of the Red Cross not to mount offensive weapons, military ambulances are often unarmed. It is a generally accepted practice in most countries to classify the personnel attached to military vehicles marked as ambulances as non-combatants; however, this application does not always exempt medical personnel from catching enemy fire—accidental or deliberate. As a result, medics and other medical personnel attached to military ambulances are usually put through basic military training, on the assumption that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> use a weapon. The laws of war do allow non-combatant military personnel to carry individual weapons for protecting themselves and casualties. However, not all militaries exercise this right to their personnel.|$|E
5|$|The National Rail Administration {{has stated}} that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> close Innherred Sykehus Station. The station {{is located in a}} curve and within the {{signaling}} area of Levanger Station, and the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate has required the station to be corrected by 2012. Because of the adjacent Levanger Hospital, the station is one of the busiest on the system, with 90,000 annual riders. One possible solution is to move the platforms of Levanger Station closer towards the hospital and thus serve both the town and the hospital from the same station.|$|E

5|$|The Stamford Bridge freehold, the pitch, the {{turnstiles}} and Chelsea's {{naming rights}} are {{now owned by}} Chelsea Pitch Owners, a non-profit organisation in which fans are the shareholders. The CPO was created to ensure the stadium could never again be sold to developers. As a condition for using the Chelsea FC name, the club has to play its first team matches at Stamford Bridge, which means that if the club moves to a new stadium, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> change their name.|$|E
5|$|Cubs start {{following}} their mothers at six weeks. The mother frequently shifts the cubs to new locations. A study of play behaviour of cheetah cubs showed that cubs tend to play after nursing or {{while they are}} on the move with their mothers. Play involves plenty of agility; attacks are seldom lethal. Playing cubs stay near their mothers. The study further revealed that while the cubs showed improvement in catching each other as they grew up, the ability to crouch and hide did not develop remarkably. Thus, it was suggested that play helps develop only certain aspects of predator defence. Weaning occurs at three to six months of age. The mother brings kills to her cubs; the cubs might purr as the mother licks them clean after the meal. Cubs as young as six months try to capture small prey like hares and juvenile gazelles. However, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait until as long as 15 months of age to make a successful kill on their own.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution only {{requires}} {{members of}} the Council to be Singapore citizens residing in Singapore who are at least 35 years old. There is no restriction on Cabinet ministers and members of political parties. Moreover, the Prime Minister may authorize any Minister, Minister of State or Parliamentary Secretary to attend Council meetings. It has been noted that this may have {{a chilling effect on}} the Council's deliberations as such a guest might be the author or a vocal proponent of the legislation under scrutiny. On the other hand, {{it has been suggested that}} members with political affiliations can often make the biggest contribution towards the Council's discussions. Another criticism of the PCMR's composition is that having judges on the Council may lead to a conflict of interest as <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> exercise judicial review over Acts of Parliament they have either endorsed or rejected previously.|$|E

Nomads sometimes live in geographical areas which had fewer than the required numbers to form a chapter. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> chosen <b>to</b> live somewhat solitary lives, or <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been sent <b>to</b> an area with a mandate to establish a chapter.|$|R
5|$|All puzzles {{are based}} on a {{mechanic}} of tracing a path through a maze-like route from a starting point, represented as a circle, to a goal point, represented as a line segment with a rounded end, without crossing one's path. The goal of these puzzles is not always to simply complete the maze but to find the right path that completes the puzzle correctly. Mazes may have several starting points and goals; the player may have to find the right starting point that can complete the maze, or <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> figure out how to reach a specific end point to trigger an event in the surrounding environment such as moving a platform. The puzzles include a symbolic language that denotes the mechanics for that maze. For example, puzzles that present mazes with black and white squares in the spaces between traceable paths require the player to find a path through the maze that separates these squares by color. Other puzzles require the player to use the environment to determine how to solve the puzzle, such as studying a nearby tree with branches that mimic the puzzle, or by observing symbols on nearby floors and walls that align with the puzzle's configuration. The puzzles within each island section {{are based on}} common mechanic, often with a sequence of puzzles appearing early in each section that are designed to help the player identify and understand the mechanic and meaning of the symbols. Later puzzles combine two or more different mechanics into the same puzzle using the consistent symbolic language.|$|E

Nearly 78 per cent of farmers said they will get better prices for their produce from multi-format stores. Over 75 per cent of the traders claimed their marketing resources will continue to be needed to push sales through multiple channels, but <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> accept lower margins for greater volumes.|$|E

25|$|The pre-parade segment {{today may}} include mass-displays, choir {{performances}}, school band displays, sky-diving displays, and other light-hearted performances {{to entertain the}} crowd prior to the parade proper, with the added positive effect of encouraging parade-attendees to be seated earlier. Initially introduced on an ad-hoc basis as an informal filler, it has since became {{an integral part of}} the parade particularly when live television coverage was extended to this segment in recent years. As audience participation has become a part of the parade, the pre-parade segment also becomes an opportunity for the hosts to lead and rehearse with the audience actions <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do when the parade proper begins.|$|E
25|$|Hummingbirds {{have the}} ability to digest sucrose unlike many passerines that prefer hexoses (fructose and glucose). Starlings and their {{relatives}} will completely avoid sucrose. Nectar feeding birds typically have a mechanism to quickly excrete excess water. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> drink four to five times their body mass of liquid during the day to obtain enough energy. Hummingbirds are capable of excreting nitrogenous wastes as ammonia since they can afford more water loss than birds that feed on low-moisture food sources. Hummingbirds and sunbirds also have special anatomical and physiological adaptations that allow them to quickly excrete excess water. Hummingbirds are also able to turn off their kidney function at night.|$|E
25|$|Most people {{engage in}} sexual {{activity}} because of pleasure they derive from the arousal of their sexuality, especially if they can achieve orgasm. Sexual arousal can also be experienced from foreplay and flirting, and from fetish or BDSM activities, or other erotic activities. Most commonly, people {{engage in sexual}} activity because of the sexual desire generated by a person to whom they feel sexual attraction; but they may engage in sexual activity for the physical satisfaction they achieve {{in the absence of}} attraction for another, {{as in the case of}} casual or social sex. At times, a person may engage in a sexual activity solely for the sexual pleasure of their partner, such as because of an obligation <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> the partner or because of love, sympathy or pity they may feel for the partner.|$|E

25|$|The Intersection, used in U.S. seasons 10, 11, and 16, {{requires}} {{each team}} to pair {{up with one}} other team and perform all tasks and make decisions together until further notice. Should there be no other teams present when a given team arrives at the Intersection Route Marker, they must wait there until another team arrives, although {{they do not have}} to partner with that team and can opt to wait for another team instead. Teams are free to choose their partner team if multiple teams are present. Teams are not warned when an Intersection is coming. The Intersection may have teams simply working together on standard Route Marker tasks, or <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> work together on Roadblocks or Fast Forwards. The first season of the Australian version featured two separate Intersections during its run, with the second Intersection having a unique set of penalties for quitting part way through the task.|$|E
25|$|Aedes females {{generally}} {{drop their}} eggs singly, much as Anopheles do, {{but not as}} a rule into water. Instead, they lay their eggs on damp mud or other surfaces near the water's edge. Such an oviposition site commonly is {{the wall of a}} cavity such as a hollow stump or a container such as a bucket or a discarded vehicle tire. The eggs generally do not hatch until they are flooded, and <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> withstand considerable desiccation before that happens. They are not resistant to desiccation straight after oviposition, but must develop to a suitable degree first. Once they have achieved that, however, they can enter diapause for several months if they dry out. Clutches of eggs of the majority of mosquito species hatch as soon as possible, and all the eggs in the clutch hatch at much the same time. In contrast, a batch of Aedes eggs in diapause tends to hatch irregularly {{over an extended period of}} time. This makes it much more difficult to control such species than those mosquitoes whose larvae can be killed all together as they hatch. Some Anopheles species do also behave in such a manner, though not to the same degree of sophistication.|$|E
25|$|As some {{of their}} {{potential}} witnesses are attacked and prevented from supporting the Cullens, Carlisle and Edward realize <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fight the Volturi. Their witnesses ultimately agree to stand with them in battle, having realized the Volturi increased the Guard by falsely accusing covens of crimes, destroy them and then recruit vampires with gifts. The Volturi arrive prepared for battle, led by Aro, who is eager to obtain the gifted members of the Cullen coven {{as part of his}} guard. Aro is allowed to touch Renesmee, and is convinced that she is not an immortal child. Irina is brought forth and takes full responsibility for her mistake, leading to her immediate death. Aro still insists that Renesmee may pose a risk in the future, validating his claim that battle is necessary. Before any violence, Alice shares with Aro her vision of the battle that is to come, during which both sides sustain heavy casualties, including Aro who would also die. Aro believes her, giving Alice and Jasper an opportunity to reveal their witness, Nahuel (a half mortal half vampire just like Renesmee). The witness proves that he is not a threat, supporting the notion that Renesmee is not a threat. The Volturi unhappily walk away, explaining {{that there will be no}} battle today.|$|E
