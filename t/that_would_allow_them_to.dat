5|$|Prehistoric art in Scotland is {{visual art}} created or {{found within the}} modern borders of Scotland, before the {{departure}} of the Romans from southern and central Britain in the early fifth century CE, which is usually seen as the beginning of the early historic or Medieval era. There is no clear definition of prehistoric art among scholars and objects that may involve creativity often lack a context <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be understood.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision. Their eyes {{are large and}} possess a {{reflective}} layer, called the tapetum lucidum, that improves low-light vision. It is possible that this layer blurs the images they see, as the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of only one color. They lack the opsin gene <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.|$|E
5|$|Tristano is {{regarded}} as one of the first to teach jazz, particularly improvisation, in a structured way. He taught musicians irrespective of their instrument and structured lessons to meet the needs of each individual. Lessons were typically 15–20 minutes in length. He did not teach the reading of music or the characteristics of different styles of jazz, instead challenging students in ways <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> find and express their own musical feelings, or style.|$|E

5|$|On 12 May 2005, Red Football {{announced}} that it had reached an agreement with shareholders J. P. McManus and John Magnier to purchase Cubic Expression's 28.7% stake in the club, which gave the Glazers a controlling stake with just under 57% of the club's shares. They then managed to secure the stake of the third-largest stakeholder, Scottish mining entrepreneur Harry Dobson, taking their share total to 62% of the club. By 13 May, the Glazers had bought a further 12.8% stake taking their total ownership to 74.81%, just shy of the 75% threshold <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> end the club's public limited company (PLC) status and delist it from the London Stock Exchange. On 16 May, the Glazers took their shareholding in Manchester United to 75.7%, and a month later, on 22 June, they removed the club's shares from the stock exchange {{for the first time}} in 14 years.|$|E
5|$|The route Stavanger–Bergen–Trondheim {{was awarded}} to Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap in 1956, but this company filed for {{bankruptcy}} the following year. Ålesund Airport, Vigra was {{scheduled to open in}} 1958, and both Braathens SAFE and SAS applied for the concession, along with the route along the West Coast. At first the ministry wanted to issue the concession on the route Stavanger – Bergen – Ålesund – Trondheim to Braathens SAFE and the route Ålesund–Oslo to SAS. But after negotiations, Braathens SAFE stated they were willing to fly the coastal route without subsidies if they were granted the Oslo-route, since <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> cross-subsidize; this was granted by the ministry. An agreement was then made between the ministry, SAS and Braathens SAFE, where both airlines would fly the routes Oslo–Trondheim, Oslo–Stavanger, Oslo–Kristiansand and Kristiansand–Stavanger–Bergen; Braathens SAFE had a monopoly on the routes Oslo–Ålesund and Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim, while SAS was granted a monopoly on the routes Oslo–Bergen and (Oslo)–Trondheim–Bodø–Bardufoss. In 1958, Braathens SAFE had 77,591 passengers.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in England, where kinship was predominately cognatic (derived {{through both}} males and females), in Scotland kinship was agnatic, with {{members of a group}} sharing a (sometimes fictional) common ancestor. Women {{retained}} their original surname at marriage, symbolising that they did not join their husband's kin, and marriages were intended to create friendship between kin groups, rather than a new bond of kinship. Women could marry from the age of 12 (while for boys it was from 14) and, while many girls from the social elite married in their teens, most in the Lowlands only married after a period of life-cycle service, in their twenties, by which they accrued resources, status and skills <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> establish a household. Normally marriage followed handfasting, a period of betrothal, which in the Highlands may have effectively been a period of trial marriage, in which sexual activity may have been accepted as legitimate. Highland women, based on the higher birth rate of the Highlands, might have married earlier than their Lowland counterparts.|$|E

50|$|Fosdyk's papers {{say that}} he had to leave the United States quickly due to some misfortunes, and being a friend to Captain Benjamin Briggs, he {{convinced}} the captain to allow him on board.

5|$|Before the 1080s, the {{majority}} of officials drafted came from a regionally diverse background; afterwards, intraregional patterns of drafting officials became more common. Hartwell writes that during the Southern Song, the shift of power from central to regional administrations, the localized interests of the new gentry, the enforcement of prefectural quotas in preliminary examinations, and the uncertainties of a successful political career in the factionally split capital led many civil servants to choose positions <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> remain in specific regions. Hymes demonstrates how this correlated with the decline in long-distance marriage alliances that had perpetuated the professional elite in the Northern Song, as the Southern Song gentry preferred local marriage prospects. It {{was not until the}} reign of Emperor Shenzong (r. 1068–1085) that the now heavily populated regions of South China began providing a quantity of officials in policy-making posts that were proportionate to their share of China's total population. From 1125 to 1205, about 80% of all those who held office in one of the six ministries of the central government had spent most of their low-grade official careers within the area of modern southern Anhui, southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces. Almost 100% of these officials were born and buried within this southeastern macroregion.|$|E
5|$|The walled towns {{were planned}} {{out in a}} regular fashion, drawing both on the {{experience}} of equivalent bastides in France and on various English planned settlements. Their new residents were English migrants, with the local Welsh banned from living inside the walls. The towns had varying levels of success. Measured in terms of burgages, town properties rented from the Crown by citizens, Conwy had 99 around 1295, and Caernarfon had 57 in 1298. Harlech lagged badly behind in terms of growth, and the town had only 24 and a half burgages in 1305. The castles were entrusted by Edward to constables, charged to defend them and, in some cases, also empowered to defend the town walls as well. Permanent garrisons of soldiers were established, 40 at Caernarfon, 30 at Conwy and 36 at Harlech, equipped with crossbows and armour. The castles and towns were all ports and could be supplied by sea if necessary, an important strategic advantage as Edward's navy had near total dominance around the Welsh coastline. The castles were each equipped with a rear or postern gate <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> resupplied directly by sea even if the town had fallen.|$|E
5|$|Continuing their explorations, {{they reach}} a {{universe}} where humans are subservient to dogs. Stewie finally figures {{out how to}} modify the remote device {{so that they can}} return home; but Brian, overwhelmed by the thought of a world run by dogs like himself, is reluctant to leave and steals the remote. Stewie and Brian fight over the device, ultimately breaking it, which traps them in the alternative universe. In desperation, the two go to the universe's version of the Griffin family– who are all dogs except for their pet Brian, who is human– hoping to find a solution. The dog version of Stewie quickly confronts the two, revealing that he has also developed a universe-traveling device <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> return to their own universe. Before Dog Stewie can fetch them his remote control, Human Stewie bites the dog version of his father, Peter, and is sent to the pound where he is to be euthanized later that day. The two Brians and Dog Stewie go to the human pound to free him, and both Stewie and Brian are sent back to their original universe. As they are being transported, human Brian, dreaming of a better life in a world of intelligent inhabitants, leaps into the inter-universe portal at the last moment and successfully makes it to the original universe with the other two. Excited about his new prospects in life, human Brian begins his optimistic adventure in a brand new universe but is quickly struck by a car.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} {{to both the}} Norris-La Guardia Act and the NIRA, workers who were previously unorganized {{in a number of}} industries—such as rubber workers, oil and gas workers and service workers—began to look for organizations <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> band together. The NIRA strengthened workers' resolve to unionize and instead of participating in unemployment or hunger marches, they started to participate in strikes for union recognition in various industries". In 1933, the number of work stoppages jumped to 1,695, double its figure from 1932. In 1934, 1,865 strikes occurred, involving more than 1.4 million workers.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{the company}} Global Horizons was indicted {{on charges of}} {{trafficking}} over 200 Thai workers. With the program, bonded labor, it was guaranteed that the workers were going to receive a visa, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> {{live and work in}} the United States. Upon arrival, the company made a false statement to lure the workers and having a higher recruitment. The fees that were imposed to the farm workers were so high, that the debt was impossible to pay with the employment they were given. Many were living in poor housing conditions (up to a dozen living per home),threats, and even physical assaults.|$|E
25|$|According to Kelly's theory, {{the manner}} of {{accessing}} stored information would depend on whether the culture was mobile or more settled. Hunter-gatherer societies would depend on portable mnemonic devices and techniques <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> use the landscape as a mnemonic tool, such as the method of loci. Kelly has observed similar techniques within the modern Australian Aborigines, who use features on the landscape as visual cues to retrieve information. On the other hand, societies that were less mobile but not completely settled would create local replications of the landscape to access information, such as circles of timber or stone, sequences of mounds and other prehistoric built environments.|$|E
50|$|Though Steiner {{saw that}} spiritual vision itself is {{difficult}} for others to achieve, he recommended open-mindedly exploring and rationally testing the results of such research; he also urged others to follow a spiritual training <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> directly to apply the methods he used eventually to achieve comparable results. Some results of Steiner's research have been investigated and supported by scientists working to further and extend scientific observation in directions suggested by an anthroposophical approach.|$|R

25|$|At that time, NA {{was not yet}} {{recognized}} by society at large as a positive force. The initial group had difficulty finding places <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> meet, and often had to meet in people's homes. The first meetings of Narcotics Anonymous were held in the basements of churches for the members protection because at that time an old law prohibiting convicted felons from congregating was still being upheld and churches offered their basements as a sanctuary. Addicts would have to cruise around meeting places and check for surveillance, to make sure meetings would not be busted by police. It was many years before NA became recognized as a beneficial organization, although some early press accounts were very positive.|$|E
25|$|When {{the force}} led by Marshals Marmont and Mortier moved east, Merlin formed its advance guard. On 23 March 1814 at Bergères, his troopers drove off an Allied {{foraging}} party, capturing 100 men and liberating 16 wagon loads of plunder. At the Battle of Fère-Champenoise on 25 March, Marmont and Mortier with 18,100 infantry, 4,350 cavalry and 84 guns found themselves facing 26,400 Allied cavalry and 128 guns. Merlin's division {{was involved in}} the fighting which ended in a serious French defeat. For the Battle of Paris on 30 March Merlin's division was reduced to 850 horsemen in the brigades of Pierre François Huber and Antoine Henri Latour-Foissac. Marmont and Mortier led 19,961 foot soldiers and 5,565 horsemen against 119,000 Allied infantry and 26,500 cavalry. Bordesoulle's corps and Louis Pierre Aimé Chastel's cavalry division were posted on the extreme right flank. After stiff fighting, Marmont and Mortier agreed to an armistice <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> evacuate Paris.|$|E
25|$|The French {{government}} had devised a plan <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> launch their invasion. It required a junction {{of the two}} French fleets in the English Channel, {{where they would be}} able to cover a major invasion. However, in August 1759 the French Mediterranean Fleet under Admiral La Clue left harbour and was destroyed at the Battle of Lagos near Portugal. This left only the Channel Fleet at Brest under Conflans. When he tried to break free of the British blockade in November, he was run down and attacked by the British under Admiral Hawke at the Battle of Quiberon Bay. This victory left the British in almost total command of the seas, compounded by the effective use of naval forces in the West Indies, Canada and India. A small French force under Thurot did manage to land on the Irish coast, and menace Belfast before being forced to withdraw and being destroyed by a Royal Navy squadron in the Irish Sea.|$|E

25|$|The Gettysburg Campaign {{represented}} the final major offensive by Robert E. Lee in the Civil War. Afterward, all combat {{operations of the}} Army of Northern Virginia were in reaction to Union initiatives. Lee suffered over 27,000 casualties during the campaign, a price {{very difficult for the}} Confederacy to pay. The campaign met only some of its major objectives: it had disrupted Union plans for a summer campaign in Virginia, temporarily protecting the citizens and economy of that state, and it had allowed Lee's men to live off the bountiful Maryland and Pennsylvania countryside and plunder vast amounts of food and supplies that they carried back with them and <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> continue the war. However, the myth of Lee's invincibility had been shattered and not a single Union soldier was removed from the Vicksburg Campaign to react to Lee's invasion of the North. (Vicksburg surrendered on July 4, the day Lee ordered his retreat.) Union campaign casualties were approximately 30,100.|$|E
25|$|The canal {{was not a}} {{financial}} success, and in 1866 the company obtained an act of Parliament <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> sell the canal providing three-quarters of the shareholders agreed. In 1885, they decided to use this power, as Edward Press, the owner of Bacton Wood mill, and a trader with a fleet of wherries, wished to purchase it. The sale was completed on 16 March 1886, on the understanding that the £600 price would be distributed to the shareholders. Holders of 446 of the original 586 shares were traced, but after paying money on 55 shares, James Turner, the London solicitor handling the sale, absconded {{with the rest of}} the fund. The proprietors felt morally bound to refund the money themselves, but did not do so immediately, as none of the shareholders made a claim. Eventually in 1896, five of them, including Press who had bought the canal, contributed £110 17s 7d (£110.88) to a fund which was distributed as a dividend to those who had not been paid.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, the Scots Greys {{were once}} again in the field under Marlborough. With the French armies pressing the Alliance, Marlborough's forces had to remain in the Low Countries. The French armies were manoeuvring to fight a battle <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> dictate terms for a peace treaty. The two armies met near Ramillies on 23 May 1706. During the battle, the Scots Greys, serving in Lord Hays' brigade of dragoons, forced their way into the village of Autre Eglise, routing the French infantry defending the village. After passing through the village, the Scots Greys encountered French and quickly defeated the Régiment du Roi. The French quickly surrendered, with the Scots Greys capturing their colours. It was also at this battle that the Scots Greys discovered that one of its troopers was more than he appeared. Carried wounded from the battle to the surgeon, it was discovered that one of the dragoons was in fact a woman who had joined the regiment searching for her husband.|$|E
