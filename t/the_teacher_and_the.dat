5|$|In a Year 3 {{elementary}} {{classroom in}} South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan {{was put into}} place. The study gave limits on the amounts of questions the children could ask, {{and if they did}} not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> students, the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.|$|E
25|$|At the {{commencement}} of the instruction, the teacher either prepares {{a plan for the}} autumn term's teaching in collaboration with the students or informs the students of such a plan. In the later phases of the instruction, <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> students plan the work together. <b>The</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> students regularly discuss the instruction given. Instruction in the individual classes is co-ordinated with a view to achieving a coherence between the different subjects and a suitable distribution of the student's workload.|$|E

25|$|Just as the Imām {{is seen by}} Ismailis as {{the manifestation}} of the first-created Light, during the period between the Imāmates of Muhammad ibn Ismail and al-Madhi Billah, the {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> student became a sacred one, and the Dai became a position much beyond a normal missionary. The Dai passed on the sacred and hidden knowledge of the Imām to the student, who could then use that information to ascend to higher levels. First the student loved the Dai, and from the Dai he learned to love the Imām, who was but an interceder on behalf of God. In Nizari Ismailism, the head Dai is called the Pir.|$|E
25|$|Often a tree will be {{associated}} with oracles. The oak of Dodona was tended by priests who slept on the ground. Forms of the tall oaks of the old Prussians were inhabited by gods who gave responses, and so numerous are the examples that the old Hebrew terebinth of <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> terebinth of the diviners may reasonably be placed in this category. Important sacred trees are also the object of pilgrimage, {{one of the most}} noteworthy being the branch of the Bo tree at Sri Lanka brought thither before the Christian era. The tree spirits will hold sway over the surrounding forest or district, and the animals in the locality are often sacred and must not be harmed.|$|E

Even in 2000 many teachers has taken classes in rooms without fence. Though there were many infrastructural limitations but <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> authority were very much sincere about the quality of education {{from the very beginning of}} this institution.|$|R

25|$|The {{notion of}} {{evidence}} based practice {{has also had}} an influence {{in the field of}} education. Here, some commentators have suggested that the putative lack of any conspicuous progress is attributable to practice resting in the unconnected and noncumulative experience of thousands of individual teachers, each re-inventing the wheel and failing to learn from hard scientific evidence about 'what works'. Opponents of this view argue that hard scientific evidence is a misnomer in education; knowing that a drug works (in medicine) is entirely different from knowing that a teaching method works, for the latter will depend on a host of factors, not least those to do with the style, personality and beliefs of <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> needs of the particular children (Hammersley 2013). Some opponents of EBP in education suggest that teachers need to develop their own personal practice, dependent on personal knowledge garnered through their own experience. Others argue that this must be combined with research evidence, but without the latter being treated as a privileged source.|$|E
25|$|In 1871 Waitetuna {{residents}} {{agreed to}} build a school, but an 1872 flood washed away the timber for the scheme. A half-time school and a private school ran for a while. Waitetuna School District was gazetted in 1873, but the Education Rate proved insufficient to pay <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> school closed in 1875. A new school on donated land opened, with a teacher's residence added in 1877 and an adjacent 11 acres added by the Waste Lands Board in 1878. As early as 1882 a petition requested the school be {{moved away from the}} damp hollow, but nothing happened until the main road was diverted through the grounds in 1906. On 24 August 1903 Waitetuna School changed its name to Te Uku. In August 1908 the present school was established about 800 metres to the east, with one room on another 2 acres of donated land. Inadvertently, an acre of Church land was taken by the school until sold for a post office and store in 1923. A second classroom was added in 1935, a teacher's house in 1941, a concrete play area in 1948, a football paddock leased from 1951, a prefab added in 1954, a lavatory block in 1957, a school pool in 1961 and the Aramiro School building moved here in 1965. Ohautira Maori School closed in 1969, shortly after the timber mill, and in 1975 another classroom was added.|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{maintain}} {{the system of}} having scholars specialized in certain time periods and authors, Wellek and Warren push for scholars who have mastered certain approaches and thought patterns, preferably those who are from a literary background. They also recommend [...] "sharper distinction between <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> scholar", allowing some individuals to devote their careers to research and not teaching. They emphasize a need for fluency in several modern languages rather than {{an understanding of the}} classical ones; this coincides with their urge to establish departments teaching comparative literature. They recommend the teaching of literary methods and theories in combination with periods and authors, with a retooling of the doctoral dissertation procedures.|$|E

In 1972, ACLU cooperating attorneys in Oregon filed the first federal civil rights case involving a claim of unconstitutional discrimination against a gay or lesbian public school teacher. [...] The U.S. District Court held that a state statute that authorized school districts to fire teachers for [...] "immorality" [...] was unconstitutionally vague, and awarded monetary damages to the teacher. [...] The court refused to reinstate <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that refusal by a 2 to 1 vote. Burton v. Cascade School District, 353 F. Supp. 254 (D. Or. 1972), aff'd 512 F.2d 850 (1975). [...] In 1973 the ACLU created the Sexual Privacy Project (later the Gay and Lesbian Rights Project) which combated discrimination against homosexuals. This support continues even today. After then-Senator Larry Craig was arrested for soliciting sex in a public restroom, the ACLU wrote an amicus brief for Craig, saying that sex between consenting adults in public places was protected under privacy rights.|$|E

In chapter 3 of Taittiriya Upanishad, human knowledge is described as that which connects <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> student through the medium of exposition, just like a child is the connecting link between the father and the mother through the medium of procreation.
