5|$|The {{nature of}} <b>that</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> highway, {{described}} as largely a straight road with a featureless agricultural landscape, {{was said to}} make drivers feel less involved and lose focus on the road. In winter, the area between Woodstock and Chatham is also subject to sudden snow squalls from lake-effect snow.|$|E
5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was {{initially}} signposted in 1919, the westernmost section of today's M-136 was designated {{as part of}} M-19. In 1927, <b>that</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> highway was redesignated as M-13 and extended through Avoca. During 1929, the trunkline was extended eastward to terminate at the contemporary M-51 near Gardendale.|$|E

5|$|After {{environmental}} {{studies on the}} White Slough, Caltrans widened and elevated <b>that</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> the road and converted it to a freeway. To accommodate bicycles and pedestrians, a cycleway was built along the eastbound side of the freeway. Finally, Caltrans completed the overpass which crossed SR 29, Broadway, and Mini Drive (bypassing Marine World Parkway, three traffic signaled intersections, and a railroad grade crossing). The project was completed {{in the summer of}} 2005, and fully open to traffic on August 20.|$|E
5|$|Cleomenes {{noted that}} Antigonus had {{dismissed}} his Macedonian troops and only traveled with his mercenaries. At the time Antigonus was in Aegium, a three-day march from Megalopolis. Most of the Achaeans of military age {{had been killed}} at Mount Lycaeum and Ladoceia. Cleomenes ordered his army to take five days' worth of rations and sent his troops toward Sellasia, to {{give the appearance of}} raiding the territory of Argos. From there he went to the territory of Megalopolis; during the night he ordered one of his friends, Panteus, to capture the weakest section of the walls, while Cleomenes {{and the rest of the}} army followed. Panteus managed to capture <b>that</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> the wall after killing the sentries. This allowed Cleomenes and the rest of the Spartan army to enter the city.|$|E
5|$|M-33 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan {{that runs from}} Interstate 75 (I-75) at Alger in Arenac County north to M-27 near Cheboygan. In between, the trunkline runs through rural sections of the northeastern Lower Peninsula including state and national forest areas. M-33 connects {{to a handful of}} parks and crosses several of the rivers in <b>that</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> the state. It runs concurrently with three other state highways, sharing pavement to connect through several small communities of Northern Michigan.|$|E

5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{maintains}} M-43 {{like all}} other state trunkline highways. As a part of those responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic along its roadways using a metric called average annual daily traffic. This is a calculation of the traffic levels for a roadway segment for any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT determined that the highest traffic volume along M-43 was east of the I-96/I-69 interchange at 38,927vehicles per day. The highest commercial traffic was west of the interchange at 645trucks daily. The lowest volumes were at Woodland with only 1,700vehicles and 120trucks traveling along <b>that</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> the highway daily.|$|E
5|$|The last OE {{service to}} this station {{operated}} on June 19, 1931, {{after the company}} requested, and received, permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission to abandon <b>that</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> route because of declining ridership and worsening traffic congestion. The service was cut back to Front and Jefferson streets the following day, and OE moved its ticket office to that location. The tracks along 10th and Salmon streets were abandoned and soon removed. Just two years later, in May 1933, the Oregon Electric discontinued all its remaining passenger service, becoming exclusively a freight railroad.|$|E
5|$|West of Grand Blanc, US23 meets I-75, {{and the two}} freeways merge {{near the}} Bishop International Airport and {{continue}} along {{the west side of}} the Flint metro area. I-75/US23 has an interchange with I-69 near the crossing with the Canadian National Railway line. Continuing northwards through suburban residential areas, the highway crosses the Flint River while running along {{the west side of the}} city. In Mount Morris Township, the freeway intersects the northern end of I-475 before meeting M-57 near Clio. The highest traffic totals along US23 in the state of Michigan were recorded by MDOT near the M-57 interchange; in 2009 an average 68,800vehicles used <b>that</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> freeway daily. These traffic counts are expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway.|$|E

5|$|What Bethesda had {{originally}} disclosed to us, as an example: In <b>that</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> the game, {{there is a}} hanging corpse. What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail. And yet, when you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, {{you can see that}} it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones. That was a very different depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.|$|E
5|$|Once again, Balize, Louisiana was {{directly}} in the hurricane's path, and suffered heavily as a consequence. The storm lasted from the afternoon on Friday, September 14 to late Saturday morning. Local reports indicate heavy rain and large hail fell {{in association with the}} cyclone, and in Balize, nearly every structure was destroyed; any buildings that withstood the initial winds were swept away by the ensuing inundation. Floodwaters killed ten people at one location alone in Plaquemines Parish. Residents of the hardest-hit communities were forced to wade to safety, in some cases through water shoulder-high. Northerly winds drove water from Lake Pontchartrain that had already been built up by northeasterly winds southward over small fishing and resort towns along the southern bank of the lake. Sheds, wharves, and bathhouses along <b>that</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> the lake were destroyed. Several people drowned in flood waters that covered lower Plaquemines Parish. The hurricane drove several ships, including the steamer Galveston, ashore.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} of this work, {{published}} in 1861, was received so favourably that the author has felt bound to bestow his utmost care upon a minute and thorough revision of his book, {{in the hope of}} bringing up the information it contains to the existing state of knowledge. In this endeavour he has been assisted as well by Canon Lightfoot, to whom he is indebted for <b>that</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> the third chapter which treats of Egyptian versions of the New Testament (pp. 319-357), as also by much unsought for and most welcome help, especially {{on the part of those}} scholars who are named in p. 164, note. Without wishing to speak harshly of writers who are not very scrupulous in such matters, he has always thought it became him to borrow from no quarter without making a full and frank avowal of the fact. The author will be much rejoiced if this new edition shall be judged not less worthy than its predecessor to become a text book in Universities and Theological Celleges.|$|E

5|$|When the US Highway System {{was created}} on November 11, 1926, US25 was {{included}} in Michigan's section of the system. The US Highway designation was assigned to run along Dixie Highway replacing that segment of M-56. From Monroe northward, US25 overlapped US24 on Telegraph Road to the Dearborn area and then followed M-17 (Ecorse Road) to Fort Street and into Downtown Detroit. From there, the highway replaced M-19 to Marysville and overlapped M-29 into Port Huron to an intersection with M-21; {{the remainder of the}} highway to Port Austin was numbered M-29 only. The highway was rerouted off Telegraph Road along Dix–Toledo Highway into downtown Detroit in 1929. By the end of 1932, US25 was rerouted from downtown Monroe along Dixie Highway north to US24 instead of turning westward in the city. The next year, US25 was extended northward from Port Huron to Port Austin, replacing <b>that</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> M-29 in the process. The remainder of M-29 westward to Bay City was renumbered M-25.|$|E

40|$|While {{there has}} long been {{substantial}} research into the traits that promote bill passage in the U. S. Congress, political scientists have learned much less about the factors that keep federal laws on the books. This paper addresses that problem using a large new data set containing the revision history <b>of</b> every <b>section,</b> part, and subpart of the U. S. Code from 1973 to 1998. While most laws are of little importance and remain on the books indefinitely, our data show <b>that</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> federal law created by significant legislation (as judged by previous scholarship) are much more vulnerable to amendment and repeal. We use a proportional hazard model to jointly test competing theories of legislative behavior. One unexpected finding is <b>that</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> the U. S. Code that are heavily referenced by other <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> federal law {{are less likely to}} be altered...|$|R
