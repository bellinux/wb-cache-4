5|$|According to Thomas Sweeney, the Tolkepaya {{would tell}} US {{officers}} encountered in Quechan territory, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> 30-day march {{to their own}} territory. They wanted to discourage US encroachment on their land.|$|E
5|$|At the college, Morris met fellow first-year {{undergraduate}} Edward Burne-Jones, {{who became}} his lifelong friend and collaborator. Although from very different backgrounds, they found <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> shared attitude to life, both being keenly interested in Anglo-Catholicism and Arthurianism.|$|E
5|$|Barnes was first-choice as an opener with Arthur Morris {{throughout}} the Test series, {{although it was}} not until the Third Test <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> first-wicket partnership of any substance. Morris had broken into the team as an opener after an injury sidelined Bill Brown for the entire season.|$|E

50|$|Acceptance: With {{substance}} abusers, admitting {{the existence}} of a problem is different from accepting the problem. When a substance abuser admits <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> problem, this is more likely to occur in the bargaining stage. Accepting <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> problem is when you realise that you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> problem and start the process to resolve the issue.|$|R
5|$|In interviews, Garcia, Dae Kim, and Holloway commented <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of fun}} {{shooting}} their scenes, as {{they had}} not worked together for a while. The episode marked the first appearance of recurring guest actor Cheech Marin. It first aired on February 28, 2007, in the United States on ABC, with an estimated 12.78 million viewers. The episode received mixed reviews, with many praising its humor but still noting that little was learned concerning the show's overall mythology.|$|E
5|$|In the 2011 census, 72.8% of {{residents}} in the Uxbridge North ward answered <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> religion, compared with 19.3% who did not and 7.9% who did not answer. Of those who answered, 53% identified as Christian, followed by 6.7% who identified as Muslim and 6.2% as Sikh. The percentage identifying as Hindu was 5.4%. Figures for residents identifying as either Jewish, Buddhist or other unspecified religions were each below 1%.|$|E
5|$|The Killigrews {{controlled}} the castle for several decades, with John Killigrew's son and grandson continuing in turn as the captain there until 1605. The captains of Pendennis frequently argued {{with those of}} St Mawes and in 1630 a legal dispute broke out about the rights to search and detain incoming shipping: both castles argued <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> traditional right to do so. The Admiralty eventually issued a compromise, proposing that the castles share the searching of the traffic.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, Ben tells Jack <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> perfect plan {{to convince}} Jack {{to operate on}} Ben's spine, but it failed when Jack saw the X-rays. Afterwards, Juliet brings to Jack's cell a movie, which consists of Juliet speaking through cue cards. As Juliet discusses how the surgery will proceed, on the tape she tells Jack that Ben is a liar and very dangerous, and thus the surgery should be intentionally botched to kill Ben, and that she will protect Jack if he does so.|$|E
5|$|Within the Uxbridge South ward, 69.2% of {{residents}} answered <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> religion, compared with 23.8% {{who did not}} and 7% who did not answer. As with Uxbridge North, the majority (46.4%) identified as Christian, followed by 13.4% who identified as Muslim and 5% as Hindu. The percentage identifying as Sikh was 2.3% and those identifying as Buddhist were 1.2%. Figures for residents identifying as either Jewish or other unspecified religions were each below 1%.|$|E
5|$|Approximately sixteen {{lists of}} censured theses were {{issued by the}} University of Paris during the 13th and 14th centuries. Most of these lists of propositions were put {{together}} into systematic collections of prohibited articles. Of these, the Condemnations of 1277 are considered particularly important by those historians who consider <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> side effect of encouraging scholars to question the tenets of Aristotelian science. From this perspective, some revisionist historians maintain that the condemnations had positive effects {{on the development of}} science, perhaps even representing the beginnings of modern science.|$|E

5|$|As Marge {{prepares to}} leave Vancouver, she reveals to Homer {{that she is}} left-handed, but has always used her right hand to avoid seeming unusual (due to years of using her right hand, it renders her cross-dominant). She has enough dexterity to change Maggie's diaper and dress her one-handed. They return to the rink {{just in time to}} stop Seymour from {{forfeiting}} the match and go on to defeat Sweden for the gold. Agnes softens her attitude of unyielding contempt toward her son after he breaks his broom and has to drop out, and Marge and Homer agree <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> great date night.|$|E
5|$|Between the wars, the reservists enjoyed {{much better}} {{promotion}} prospects. While Alan Vasey, {{a major in}} the First AIF, was not promoted {{to the rank of}} lieutenant colonel until 1937, Kenneth Eather, a reservist who was too young to serve in World War I, was commissioned in 1923 and promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1935. Menzies ordered that all commands in the 6th Division be given to reservists rather than regular officers, who had become political adversaries through their outspoken opposition to the Singapore strategy. Appointments therefore went to reservists like Stanley Savige, Arthur Allen, Leslie Morshead and Edmund Herring. Later other Militia officers rose to prominence as brigade and division commanders. The distinguished records of officers like Heathcote Hammer, Ivan Dougherty, David Whitehead, Victor Windeyer and Selwyn Porter would challenge the regular officers' contention <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> special claim to senior command ability.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1826, the Canal Company had {{insufficient}} funds {{to complete the}} work, and a special meeting authorised the taking out of a mortgage to cover the £15,000 deficit. The canal was an obvious competitor to the River Tone Navigation, which was managed by the Conservators of the River Tone, a legal body created for that purpose by Act of Parliament in 1699. There was animosity between the Company and the Conservators, with the Company maintaining <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> right to use the Tone to reach the centre of Taunton, and the Conservators maintaining that they did not. The canal {{was scheduled to be}} opened on 1 January 1827, but the opening was delayed until 3 January, as the connection to the River Tone was not made until 2 January. The opening celebrations were hampered by snow and bitter cold weather.|$|E

5|$|Gobioolithus {{eggs were}} {{probably}} laid in open nests {{on the banks}} of ephemeral rivers or lakes, which could frequently flood the nesting areas and bury the eggs. The distribution of the eggs suggests <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> long-term colonial nesting site at the Khermeen Tsav locality in the Barun Goyot Formation. At the Bayn-Dzak locality, the eggs are typically arranged in clutches, whereas elsewhere they are scattered randomly, each oriented nearly vertically in the substrate. The solitary eggs may have been laid and buried individually, similar to the nesting habits of modern megapodes. It is also possible that they were originally laid in clutches, but flooding separated them and deposited them vertically as the water level dropped. Water damage would also explain why Gobioolithus shells are frequently heavily recrystallized.|$|E
5|$|On 4 November 2010, Stabæk Holding {{stated that}} they were near a bankruptcy, and that they {{intended}} to throw out Stabæk as a tenant, remove the turf and instead use the venue exclusively for events. Chair Diderik Schnitler in Stabæk Holding stated that the business model was not sustainable. The football schedule was not made until early in the year, while in the event business, bookings were common {{one to two years}} in advance. It was therefore difficult to secure lucrative events, as large parts of the year had to be held in reserve in case the venue was needed for yet-to-be scheduled matches. The holding company {{stated that they}} might have to file for bankruptcy. Stabæk Fotball stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> 40-year contract to use the venue.|$|E
5|$|Serial {{production}} of the T1000 started in 1964 by Strømmens Værksted, NEBB and AEG. Until 1978, 162 cars were delivered to Oslo Sporveier. These were manufactured in four series, designated T1 through T4, with minor changes to specifications. During the late 1970s, the western suburban lines which {{were part of the}} tramway needed new rolling stock. Oslo Sporveier was at the time considering connecting the metro with these lines, and between 1978 and 1981, 33 new T1300 cars were built. The only difference from the T1000 was <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> pantograph that allowed them to operate on the tramways. They also retained the necessary technical appliances to run on the metro. The new T1300 were designated T5 and T6. From 1985 to 1989, 16 T4s were rebuilt to T1300 and designated T7 and T8.|$|E

5|$|The {{allegations}} were first sparked by University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran, {{who claimed that}} full versions of government documents proved Canada had willful knowledge that torture would occur before handing detainees to Afghan authorities. Subsequent to this, two official complaints have led to official investigations and hearings by the Military Police Complaints Commission (MPCC). One of these unveiled parliamentary testimony by diplomat Richard Colvin, who claimed that many detainees were probably tortured, {{and it was a}} standard operating procedure for Afghan interrogators. The allegations have led to a showdown in the Canadian House of Commons, as opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) had called for the releasing of relevant documents in full and unredacted form, claiming parliamentary privilege to see them. The government maintained <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> duty to protect Canadian soldiers and citizens as the documents contained sensitive information.|$|E
5|$|After {{the winter}} campaign, Schérer placed the {{divisions}} in the positions where they would start the 1796 campaign. From right to left, they were Masséna with two divisions on the coast, Augereau on the Bormida River, Sérurier on the Tanaro, Macquard at the Col de Tende and Garnier on the far left. On 27 March 1796 Bonaparte arrived to take command of the Army of Italy. At this date Sérurier was 53 years old with 40 years of military service. He applied to retire on a pension due to his age, health and wounds, but after meeting Bonaparte he decided to stay. Masséna later wrote that Bonaparte did not impress his generals at first. Then the new commander put on his hat and sharply questioned them; the generals went away believing <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> true leader at last. Bonaparte's plan was to mass over 20,000 men under Masséna and Augereau near Carcare where the Austrian and Sardinian armies linked. Sérurier's division would join the others near Ceva as they moved west. His 9,448-strong division consisted of the 39th, 69th and 85th Line Infantry Demi-brigades.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{accident}} rate per 100 million miles for professional truckers is low, {{the high number}} of miles driven by a truck driver makes truck driving a risky occupation. Trucking transportation occupations accounted for one quarter of all work-related fatalities in 2015, more than any other U.S. job, according to the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics' annual workplace fatality report. The fatal injury rate in 2015 was 14.7 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers in transportation and material moving occupations (which includes both truckers and air transportation workers.) This was a significantly lower rate than for workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, but high compared to most other occupation categories. The report did not break out the fatal injury rate per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers among aircraft pilots and flight engineers but did note <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> high fatal injury rate compared to all workers. There were 57 fatalities among aircraft pilots and flight engineers in 2015.|$|E
