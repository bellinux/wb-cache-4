5|$|Gout {{is due to}} {{elevated}} levels of uric acid in the blood. This occurs due {{to a combination of}} diet and genetic factors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who eat a lot of meat, drink a lot of beer, or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by seeing the crystals in joint fluid or <b>tophus.</b> Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack.|$|E

50|$|The term tuffeau is {{etymologically}} related to another stone, tuff, to {{which is it}} not geologically related — and to tufa, {{to which it is}} geologically related. These words derive from Italian tufo and from Latin <b>tōphus</b> or tōfus ("stone").|$|E
5000|$|A <b>tophus</b> (Latin: [...] "stone", plural tophi) is {{a deposit}} of uric acid crystals, {{in the form}} of monosodium urate crystals, in people with longstanding hyperuricemia (high levels of uric acid in the blood). Tophi are {{pathognomonic}} for the disease gout. Most people with tophi have had previous attacks of acute arthritis, eventually leading to the formation of tophi. Chronic tophaceous gout is known as Harrison Syndrome.|$|E

50|$|The Cappuccina was {{a simple}} way of burial without {{cremation}} or with a partial cremation and was used during the Roman Age and the Medieval period; the dead {{was placed in a}} grave dug in <b>tophus</b> and then he/she was covered with tiles.Sometimes the tiles were simply put to close the grave at ground level with curved tiles placed laterally put between the tiles and the ground; sometimes the tiles were placed in a pitched way in the grave (like a tent); they were placed on the shorter side, with the lateral edges up, put closer together; on the edges the bodies were placed and other tiles were used to cover the upper corner of the tiles; finally all was covered by the soil that filled the grave.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Two {{replicate}} randomized, placebo-controlled six-month trials (RCTs) and an open-label treatment extension (OLE) {{comprised the}} pegloticase development program {{in patients with}} gout refractory to conventional therapy. In the RCTs, approximately 40 % of patients treated with the approved dose saw complete response (CR) {{of at least one}} <b>tophus.</b> Here we describe the temporal course of <b>tophus</b> resolution, total <b>tophus</b> burden in patients with multiple tophi, <b>tophus</b> size at baseline, and the relationship between <b>tophus</b> response and urate-lowering efficacy. METHODS: Baseline subcutaneous tophi were analyzed quantitatively using computer-assisted digital images in patients receiving pegloticase (8 mg biweekly or monthly) or placebo in the RCTs, and pegloticase in the OLE. <b>Tophus</b> response, a secondary endpoint in the trials, was evaluated two ways. Overall <b>tophus</b> CR was the proportion of patients achieving a best response of CR (without any new/enlarging tophi) and target <b>tophus</b> complete response (TT-CR) was the proportion of all tophi with CR. RESULTS: Among 212 patients randomized in the RCTs, 155 (73 %) had ≥ 1 <b>tophus</b> and 547 visible tophi were recorded at baseline. Overall <b>tophus</b> CR was recorded in 45 % of patients in the biweekly group (P = 0. 002 versus placebo), 26 % in the monthly group, and 8 % in the placebo group after six months of RCT therapy. TT-CR rates at six months were 28 %, 19 %, and 2 % of tophi, respectively. Patients meeting the primary endpoint of sustained urate-lowering response to therapy (responders) were more likely than nonresponders to have an overall <b>tophus</b> CR at six months (54 % vs 20 %, respectively and 8 % with placebo). CONCLUSIONS: Pegloticase reduced <b>tophus</b> burden in patients with refractory tophaceous gout, especially those achieving sustained urate-lowering. Complete resolution of tophi occurred in some patients by 13 weeks and in others with longer-term therapy...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. To {{investigate}} the associations between gout <b>tophus</b> and polymorphisms 869 T/C and 509 C/T in TGF- 1 gene. Methods. The polymorphisms 869 T/C and 509 C/T were determined in 73 gout patients and 114 healthy controls among male Taiwanese using the PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Each patient was matched with 1 – 2 controls by age within 1 – 2 yrs. The <b>tophus</b> number was measured {{from all the}} patients ’ arms and legs. Results. Neither 869 T/C nor 509 C/T {{showed a significant association}} between patients and controls in the proportions of genotypes, allele frequency or dominant and recessive models. The mean number of tophi for all patients was 1. 53 3. 44, showing a significant difference in distribution among the genotypes at polymorphism 869 T/C (P 0. 006), but not those in polymorphism 509 C/T (P> 0. 05). Those carrying genotype CC at polymorphism 869 T/C have a mean number of tophi 0. 35 (1. 11), which is significantly lower than those carrying genotype TT (3. 73 4. 67; P< 0. 05). Those with genotype TT at polymorphism 869 T/C also had 11. 06 times the likelihood of having at least one <b>tophus</b> compared with the genotype CC after adjustment of hyperuricaemia (95 % CI 1. 84, 66. 36; P 0. 009). However, except for the <b>tophus</b> number, these two polymorphisms did not show any significant association with the clinical characteristics or biochemical markers. Conclusions. The polymorphism 869 T/C in TGF- 1 gene has a significant association with the occurrence of <b>tophus</b> in gout patients...|$|E
30|$|The {{importance}} {{of the relationship between}} intratendinous tophi and envelopment of tendons and their subsequent evolution to longitudinal ruptures as a cause of relevant symptoms has already been observed in a case report described by Lagoutaris et al. [4]. When dealing with similar cases, knowing the ultrasound aspects of <b>tophus</b> enveloping the tendon (type A) and <b>tophus</b> inside the tendon (type E), it is possible to indicate clinical treatment to reduce the dimensions of tophi in order to avoid rupture of the tendon and surgery.|$|E
3000|$|There is also {{difficulty}} in diagnosing lesions found inside the tendons as exemplified in two case reports where tophi in the rotator cuff were not diagnosed in imaging examinations [19, 20] [...].The ultrasound and/or MRI images demonstrated lesions in the supraspinatus tendon that were considered rupture and calcific tendinosis. Arthroscopic and surgical findings demonstrated <b>tophus</b> inside the tendons, showing the {{difficulty in}} recognising the <b>tophus</b> by imaging methods and highlighting the possibility of considering gouty tophi in differential diagnosis of impingement syndrome in patients with chronic tophaceous gout. There is another case report in which ultrasound of the finger showed increased echogenicity and heterogeneity in the tendon. The patient was treated with oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication without clinical improvement. After a few months, surgical treatment was performed and showed chalky, crystalline deposits {{on the surface of}} the tendon. Histopathology showed fragmented nodules with amorphous basophilic material resembling sodium urate deposits surrounded by palisaded layers of histiocytes and occasional multinucleate giant cells typical of gouty <b>tophus</b> [3]. Although a <b>tophus</b> was found inside the tendon in only one case in the present study, it is possible that this incidence would be higher if all tendons were analysed in patients with chronic tophaceous gout.|$|E
30|$|The MRI {{findings}} of gout obviously {{depend on the}} clinical presentation/stage of the disease. Once a <b>tophus</b> has developed, this is visible on MRI imaging, but unfortunately the findings are not pathognomonic. In T 1 w a <b>tophus</b> is typically isointense to muscle and in T 2 w the signal intensity can vary between hypointense and hyperintense, with an intermediate signal intensity most common. This can cause diagnostic difficulties and if a <b>tophus</b> is seen in an atypical location even a malignant soft tissue mass may be considered. Other crystal arthropathies, such as calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, and disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, may also have similar imaging findings. Contrast-medium-enhancement is often seen [69]. The best discriminators are typical location and clinical presentation, the presence of typical bone erosions is also helpful for the diagnosis. There is no special imaging protocol showing pathognomonic findings.|$|E
